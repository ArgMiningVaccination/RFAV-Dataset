York Aviation LLP, in conjunction with Faber Maunsell, was appointed to carry out the Plymouth City Airport Study for Plymout h City Counc il in August 2005. The study is aimed at informing both the preparati on of the Local Development Framework for Plymout h and the Airport Company's own Master Plan. The overarching requirement for the study is to: \"provide a robust and comprehensive evidence base in relation to the case for an airport serving Plymouth for the foreseeable future, having regard to the wider regional context for a ir service provision.\" 2. Plymouth City Airport is currently owned and operat ed by Sutton Harbour Holdings on a 150 year lease from Plym outh City Council. The Airport is in the process of preparing its Master Plan, which includes proposals for a runway extension and associated infras tructure. It is proposed that land be released from the southern end of the airfield for commercial development to fund the required improvements to airport infrastructure. 3. Operations at the Air port are presently res tricted due to the short runway length and the lack of full provision of Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). Currently, the Airport is limited to ex isting aircraft types until a RESA is provided at the eastern end of the main runway. 4. Following the commencem ent of operations by Air Southwest, operating services on a regional low fares m odel, the Airport had been experiencing strong growth during 2005, al though the recent cessation of operations by Air Wales, coupled with the threat of a mo vement cap by the CAA has resulted in growth stalling in the short term. Plymouth City Airport Study ii York Aviation LLPPolicy Framework 5. It is clear that locally there is considerable support for a conti nued and strengthened role for Plymout h City Airport, albeit that the policies are not specific about how this is to be achiev ed. The overarching policy context, as set out in the Future of Air Trans port White Paper and being cascaded down into regional policy and planning frameworks within which the Plymouth City LDF will reside, is less clear about the role of the Airport. However, the more recent Regional Spatial Strategy review indicates support for the niche role of the Airport in supporting the regenerat ion of the Plymouth sub-region and goes onto lend support to the provis ion of a runway extension and new terminal, subject to the benefits to the economy being demonstrated. 6. There is a consistent vision for the future economic developm ent of the Plymouth City Region through all the strategy documents; that is the need to achieve a step change in the econom y through modernisation of the infrastructure in order to halt the recent period of economic decline. Consistently, the role of air transport links is highlighted as being crucial to achieving the economic goals. However, there is no substantiated evidence of this dependency currently availabl e through the policy documents. 7. It is within this context that there is a need for a sound, economic ally based, case to be made to support the conti nued development of the Airport within the framework of the policies set out for the Plymouth and the other airports. This creates a clear background for the cu rrent study to both define the role of Plymouth City Airport in relation to the economic needs of the local area and to secure its development on a finan cially viable basis whilst having regard to: 4 the peripherality of th e Plymouth sub-region; and 4 the link between air transport pr ovision and economic growth. Economic Context 8. It is the context of the vision for the City of Plymouth requiri ng a 'step change' in ec onomic performance that the signif icance of the Airport needs to be viewed. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP iii 9. Currently, there is reported high depend ence of local businesses on the link to London Gatwick, but the full potent ial of the Airport has not yet been exploited. Hence, the wider business community in North East Cornwall and South Devon focus more on Newquay and Exeter Airports respectively. With growth, the Airport could play a more substantial role in the wider sub- regional economy. 10. Given the tendency of growth in the ec onomy over recent years to be driven by indigenous growth, there is little clear evidence that the Airport is presently acting as a driver of economic growth ov erall, but plays more of a supporting role in the development of the econom y for those firms undertaking some level of trading outside of the sub-region. 11. The critical issues are the extent to which expansion of services at the Airport could act as a driver of future economic growth and the impact that constraint on, or even closure of, the Airport could hav e on the city region being able to realise the required 'st ep change' in performance. The Market 12. We have analysed the market for Plymouth City Airport operating in competition with the other airports in the Far South West at Exeter and Newquay. Based on this analysis, we project that Plymouth City Airport could be handling around 1 mi llion passengers per annum by 2030 based on growth of the low cost r egional airline model. T hese passenger projections are significantly higher than those put fo rward by past studies. To the extent that strategies to rege nerate Plymouth lead to an increase in po pulation and the employment base, growth in demand to use the Airport could be higher. Equally, maintaining and enhancing ai r service connectivity may be fundamental to achieving this 'City Grow th Strategy' and the 'Mackay Vision'. Plymouth City Airport Study iv York Aviation LLP13. However, there are risks to achievin g these forecasts whilst infrastructure restrictions remain in plac e. It must be highlight ed that the projections are only realisable if airlines can be attr acted to serve the Airport and our analysis suggests that this is only likel y to be achieved on a sustainable basis with a longer runway in pl ace giving greater oper ational flexibilit y. Thus, we would place greater confidence on th e longer term projections under scenarios where a runway extension is provided than on the short term projections and those relating to the present restricted scenario. 14. We believe that there is a high risk that the Airpor t will not be able to grow and may not be able to sustain its existi ng services in the longer term with the existing runway length. Development Options 15. The key issue for Plymouth City Airpor t is the length of its runway and the restrictions this imposes. Whilst the existing runway l ength is adequate for current operations and would allow some growth of the route network within the UK and near Europe using current aircraft types, these aircraft are gradually being replaced by larger turbo-prop aircraft and regional jets which require a longer runway. 16. Furthermore, the inability to increase aircraft size as demand grows will act as a deterrent to expanding operations from Plymouth, particularly given the relatively close proximity of Exeter and Newquay Airports. Generally, the cost of operating larger aircraft is lower than smaller aircraft, hence sustaining operations at Plymouth wit h very small aircraft will become uneconomic in the longer term. Eventually, we anticipate that the current types using Plymouth City Airport will bec ome obsolete and that replacement aircraft will be unable to use the runway at is current length. 17. During the course of our study three core scenarios have emerged: 4 Do nothing - no RESA works; 4 Short runway extension comprisi ng RESA works and us e of RESAs for take-off; Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP v 4 Full or long runway extensio n comprising RESA works and the maximum runway extension. 18. Whilst the CAA has present ly lift ed temporary restrictions on the number of movements using the Airport, impos ed because of the absence of an undershoot RESA at the eastern end of the runway, we believe that it can only be a matter of time before binding re strictions are imposed on the Airport in the absence of the required RESAs at both ends of the runway. The options presented by the CAA of shorteni ng the usable runway length or capping the number of movements makes it unlikely that the Airport will have a long term future unless the issues ar e resolved. Air Southwest has made clear that it would be unwilling to operate with a shorter declared landing distance, implied by the inset threshold. Capping the num ber of movements, whilst allowing existing operations to be sustained and with passenger growth up to the maximum capacity of current operations, would mean that the Airport would not be financially viable in the medium to long term. 19. Providing the eastern RESA with or with out extending the runway then becomes that only means by which t he long term future of the Airport, and the contribution it can increasingly make to the local economy, can be secured. Two schemes are now bei ng put forward by Sutton Harbour Holdings. The first would utilise the RESA as a star ter extension to provide extended take-off distances for aircraft but with the landing distance limited to current dimensions. The second would pr ovide a full extension of the runway to 1,319m for both landings and take-offs as well as the required RESAs. In both cases, embankment works would be r equired to the east of the Airport. The shorter runway scheme could fo rm a first phase of development and land would need to be safeguarded in t he LDF for the full extension. 20. The other infrastructure issues relate to the location of terminal and hangar/maintenance r elated facilities. We believe that there is no case for relocating the passenger terminal as originally proposed by Sutton Harbour Holdings, even allowing for the possibility of direct access from the A386. Extension in situ is a mo re cost effective option, particularly when runway 06/24 is closed allowing additional space for the aircraft apron. Plymouth City Airport Study vi York Aviation LLP21. The critical issue is the location of the hangar and engine test bay, as relocation of these is fundamental to re leasing a significant area of land at the southern end of runway 06/24 for disposal and alternative use. This is essential to raise capital to enable t he development of the RESA and runway extension. There are env ironmental issues which are material to this relocation and resolution of this issue is key to establishing the overall financial viability of the runway extension plan. 22. There are substantial ri sks inherent in all options: 4 no develo pment runs the risk of the CAA imposing further restrictions on the operation of the Airport; 4 provision of RESAs only would avoid further oper ational restrictions being imposed but would not ensure the long term growth of the Airport through attracting new airlines and services and may not generate sufficient profits to allow finance to be raised; 4 development of the short runway extension option would secure scope for growth but the remaining restriction on arrivals would still limit long term growth potential to turbo-prop aircraft only; 4 development of the long runway extension option would offer the greatest potential for the long term oper ational viability of the Airport but at the highest cost. 23. Taking into account t he risks and potential benefits from the development of the Airport, the short runw ay option is currently t he favoured option of Sutton Harbour Holdings. On the basis of our analysis, this would still leave a funding gap of the order of \u00a38.4 million. The scale of the actual funding gap can only be determined once detailed cost ings for the preferred option have been prepared and once the proceeds fr om land disposal have been confirmed. It is a pre-requisite t hat the City Council an d SWRDA will need to reinvest their shares of any disposal proceeds along side Sutton Harbour Holdings. Sutton Harbour Ho ldings will also need to confirm, by reference to a final business plan for the development, the level of debt finance which it is willing to raise for the development. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP vii Economic Impact 24. We have evaluated the economic impact of the Airport. In so doing, we hav e included the economic activity deriving from the presence of the Air Southwest base at Plymouth. In our view, these go hand in hand as without the commitment of Air Southwest to its home base airport, the future of Plymouth City Airport could not be secured. 25. Currently the Airport s upports 242 job opportunities on site (222 FTEs), of which 64% are resident in the City of Pl ymouth. Overall, activity at the Airport generates around \u00a312. 2m of gross value add ed annually to the Devon and Cornwall economy, of which around 1/3rd is realised in Plymouth. Taking indirect and induced impact into account the Airport supports around 320 jobs. 26. If the Airport is able to grow, the m easurable contribution to employment and gross value added in the s ub-region will increase, al beit econom ies of scale in airport operations mean that growth will be at a slower rate than absolute passenger growth. If the Airport were able to support a throughput of around 1mppa by 2030, then it would be supporting in total some 1,480 jobs including direct, indirect and induced jobs and generating a gross value added in Devon and Cornwall of \u00a3125.8m. In the c ontext of the need for growth of jobs and value within t he sub-regional economy, the potential contribution is not insignificant. 27. However, the most impor tant potential im pact of th e Airport is to the wider regeneration of the Plymout h economy. It is not possible to quantify the impact nor to relate the pot ential specifically to the key strategy elements as the strategy for implementing the Vision for Plymouth is still being developed. 28. Nonetheless, it is clear that air serv ice accessibility is one of the key drivers of city growth, impacting on: 4 attracting of new high tech and creative industries; 4 attracting new short break /high spending tourist visits; 4 improving productivity of local companies through reducing journey times. Plymouth City Airport Study viii York Aviation LLP29. The image value to Plymouth of having an airport should not be underestimated as this is almost as important as the actual contribution of the Airport to realising wider development. 30. To provide some measure of the wid er benefits from t he existence of the Airport, we have examined the journey time saving s made by airport users through being able to fly direct to Plymouth rather than having to use alternative airports or m odes of transport. We assess that currently, these amount to \u00a33 million per annum to UK resi dents today, rising to \u00a340 million or more by 2030 if the Airport develops, allowing for growth in passenger numbers and increasing values of time as incomes rise. 31. The Airport also has the potential to improve the connec tedness of Plymouth as a place to do business. Presently Plym outh is less well connected by air than many of the cities whic h it aspires to be like in terms of the Vision. Our assessment of the likely routes and services which Pl ymouth City Airport could attract in the longer term, with the infrastructure in place, suggests that the air service connectedness of Plymouth and its attractiveness, on this dimension, as a place to do business could double. However, this would still leave it less well connected than most of its comparator cities. The contribution of the Airpor t is thus beneficial but cannot be seen as a key driver of economic growth in the absence of other critical success factors. 32. As Plymouth strives to achieve the 'step change' in economic performance implied by realising the Vision, it will be important to lever the advantages which the Airport can offer. At the very least, in the circumstances where increasing employment and po pulation levels are impo rtant to delivering the Vision, the direct, indirect and induc ed employment generated by the Airport will, of itself, be valuable. 33. Furthermore, loss of the Airport w ould cle arly be damaging to the image of Plymouth as a business centre. Notwithstanding the emphasis on endogenous growth, dependence of new bus iness on air service access, not just to London but to other business centres in the UK and beyond is likely to increase over time. Whilst we cannot quantify the wider b enefits from an expanding air service offer, other than through the incremental journey time savings and measures of connectivity , experience of other cities would suggest that the perception of connectedness may be as great an influence as the actual air service offer provided. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP ix Environment 34. It is clear that the mo st signific ant environmental impact of Plymouth City Airport is noise nuisance. However, th is needs to be set in context as the number of residents affected by noise from airborne o perations is relatively small despite the high density of popul ation adjacent to the Airport. No residents are affected by higher comm unity annoyance levels from airborne operations but it has to be acknowl edged that the number of residents affected at the lower annoyance threshol d is relatively high when considered against the relatively low level of commercial activity at the Airport today. 35. Whilst growth of commercial traffic at the Airport will in crease the numbers of people affected by noise, the absolute numbe r is still likely to be low relative to other airports in urban locations. This will need to be confirmed by detailed modelling work. 36. The significant issues relate to sing le noise events, mostly on the ground. These are associated with, mainly, m ilitary helicopter oper ations and ground running of aircraft engines, particularly in the early morning hours. Appropriate mitigation measur es will need to be put in place to limit these nuisances. Flying training activity also gives rise to some nuisance. As commercial operations at the Airport increase and financial viability is secured, it may be possible to seek some limitation on these activities. 37. As we have indicated, the key issue centres on the noise impact of aircraft maintenance related activities and hel icopter operations, rather than the impact of expanded commercial aircra ft operations themselves. Engine testing activity is essentially related to the Air Southwest base at the Airport; the loss of which would be extremel y damaging to the prospects for passenger growth at Plym outh City Airport, whilst he licopter operations both make a material contribution to financ ing the airport operat ion as well as underpinning a part of the continuing presence in Plymouth. Plymouth City Airport Study x York Aviation LLP38. It is clear that expansion of the Airport will require impr oved noise mitigation measures to be put in place. Ho wever, undue restrict ion on operations could have a severe adverse impact on the viability of the Airport and could hasten closure if imposed before growth in commercia l operations provides a compensatory income stream. Em phasis should therefore be on noise mitigation measures, such as relocati on and full screening of the engine test bay. These measures have a cost whic h would need to be considered in the final investment appraisal. 39. Over and above the noise impact of t he Airport, we have identified a number of other environmental concerns but none of these would appear significant impediments to growth and expansion of the Airport. Surface Access 40. The Airport is locate d in the increasi ngly congested A386 corridor. This congestion is partly a function of the su ccessful development of the Derriford area as a medical/high tech cluster. The location of this cluster adjacent to the Airport suggests opportunities for sy nergies between the attraction of new firms to the area and the need for im proved access to London and other key business cities. 41. The Local Development Framework Area Action Plan fo r Derriford/Seaton and Southway identifies the following key issues which are relevant to surface access to Plymouth City Airport: 4 how to reduce congestion on the A386 Tavistock Road caused by commuters to Derriford and the City Centre; and 4 how to promote the Airport as an important arrival point and means of transport for the City. 42. At the present time, the Airport is not ser ved by public transport, although there are good connections to Derriford itself. Improved public transport access will be essential to securing the ability of the Air port to grow and consideration should be give n to extending bus routes from Derriford Hospital to the Airport. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP xi 43. Physical development of the Airport will result in severance of some road and footpath links to the east of the site, t he impacts of which will need to be the subject of further study. However, re lease of the runway 06/24 land offers some opportunity for improved connecti ons between Derriford and Tavistock Road. Further considerati on will need to be given to how this is secured at the detailed pl anning stage. Alternative Airport Sites 44. In the light of the c onstraints on Plymouth City Ai rport, we reviewed whether there were any suitable alternativ e airpor t sites in the vicinity. From the desk top search, it was clear that that the area around Plymouth was unlikely to have a significant numbers of potential alternative airport sites due to the topography. Whilst we were able to identify a number of potential sites, it became obvious through site visits and desk top research that none of these would offer suitable alternatives to t he current airport location, at least in terms of providing an airport to so lely serve the Plymouth City area. 45. The site area which offered the most p otential is that in Sherford, as proposed during the Future of Air Transpor t White Paper consultation period. However, proposed policy changes being made to allow housing development in this location mean that this site is no longer available. 46. What must also be considered is the cost of a new airport of this scale. The costs associated with the development at the current airport site may be considered high, but could represent bette r value of investment to the region over the high cost of a whole new ai rport site. The runway extension schemes for the current airport site are likely to open up opportunities for services to the majority of major bus iness centres within the UK and Europe, and so a new airport of the scale we have considered would not offer substantial additional benefits to the business community. Given the relatively small air travel market in Plymouth, when considered on its own, it also does not appear likely that a new site would be financially viable unless it was on the basis of replacing the exis ting airports in the Far South West. Plymouth City Airport Study xii York Aviation LLPConclusions 47. In this report, we have set the po licy background, market potential and key issues affecting the role of Plymout h City Airport in the sub-regional economy. In so doing, we have identif ied the baseline impact today and the potential impact under a number of development scenarios particularly relating to the runway and related infrastructure. 48. There are environmental sensitivities regarding the current airport site but these need to be placed in context. Although the Airport is surrounded by relatively densely populat ed areas, the numbers of peo ple affected by aircraft noise is relatively low compared to other city airports and to the number of people who benefit from the presence of an airport. The key environmental issues relate to operational activiti es, largely on the ground, and helicopter operations at the airport which should be capable of improved management. 49. Because of the environmental sensit ivities of the current site, we have reviewed and rejected alternative air port sites to service the Plymouth sub- region alone. 50. In our view, the central issue remains the viability of the Airport and the costs involv ed in securing its future. Thes e need to be examined in the context of the identified benefits to the Plymouth economy and t he importance of having a viable airport to the r ealisation of the Vision for Plymouth and the City Growth Strategy. 51. The critical issue for Plymouth City Airport is ensuring that it remains attractive for airlines t o use it and to expand their operations . During the time we have been preparing this report, the Airport has suffered a withdrawal by Air Wales. This, coupled with temporary movement restrictions imposed by the CAA, has resulted in promising growth trends reversing. 52. Whilst we remain confident of the underlying potential f or growth at Plymouth City Airport, it is clear that the Airport faces subst antial challenges to ensure that it is capable of realis ing its potential, particularly in terms of operational runway length. In addition, securing growth will require th e Airport to be commercially attractive to airlines, offering low airport charges, which presents further challenges for securing viability. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP xiii 53. Theoretically, the Airport could continue to see growth with the existing runway length and with only the existing RESA provisio n, but we believe that this is not a sustainabl e position in the medium to long term as current physical shortcomings will make it mo re difficult to a ttract new carriers, leaving the Airport overly reliant on Air Southwest. In our view, a 'do nothing' option in terms of infrastructure is a high risk strategy which is unlikely to secure a viable long term fu ture for the Airport. Overall, whilst our assessment of the potential realisable ma rket with no further runway works suggests that the Airport could gr ow to be handling almost 800,000 passengers by 2030 with no further extensi on to runway length available, we ascribe a very high risk to the achievabil ity of this level of traffic given the unattractiveness of the airport offer to airlines. 54. It should be noted that under any option, the runway at Pl ymouth City Airport will still be too short to offer anything ot her than regional aircraft operations. The longer runway extension would allow regional jet oper ations, which are little noisier than turboprops but offer greater passenger comfort and greater range. With the short runway ext ension, although jet operations would theoretically be possible, we consider that the Airport would be in essence restricted to turbo-props, albeit the latest models, due to restrictions on landing distances. Do Nothing 55. The critical issue is that with the do nothi ng scenario, there is a high risk that the Airport will st agnate and ultimately close bec ause of the limitation to aircraft types which are near ing the end of their produ ction life. This makes the Airport unattractive to airlines seeking new opportunities for growth and would leave the Airport overly dependent on Air Southwest. It would also be under continuing threat of further operating restrictions by the CAA. In these circumstances, the medium to long term future of the Airport cannot be assured as the Airport is less likel y to reach the leve ls of throughput necessary to secure financial viability. Whilst we have shown theoretical potential for growth under this scenario, there is a high risk that this potential will not be realised. Plymouth City Airport Study xiv York Aviation LLP56. The discounted value of journey time benefits over the period 2006 to 2030 from retaining the existing airport in operation and able to expand within the limits of its existing runw ay length would be some \u00a3210million to residents of the South West of England. Much of this benefit derives from services to London. Although user benefits of this order are not in themselves sufficient to justify public sector investment in the Airport, coupled with wider considerations of the contribution of the Airport to realising the Vision for Plymouth, this would sugges t that the value of hav ing an Airport warrants a degree of public sector support. 57. Under a 'do nothing' scenar io, the future of the Ai rport cannot be guaranteed, hence the benefits stated abov e become losses to the sub-regional econom y if operation of the Airport became unviable and it closed. In our view, investment at least in the RESAs/short runway scheme will be necessary to secure these benefits in the longer term. Short Runway Extension 58. We have set out the costs necessary to deliver a s hort runway extension scheme. Assuming that the developmen t proceeds from disposal of the runway 06/24 land are reinvested in the development by all parties - Sutton Harbour Holdings, the City Council and SWRDA - and assuming further investment by Sutton Harbour Holdings , there is a potential funding gap of around at \u00a38.4million. To t he extent that constructi on costs are less than has been estimated this funding gap will narrow. 59. Although our analysis would suggest t hat the incremental user benefits from investing in the shor t runway extens ion, over and above maximising the potential of the current c onfiguration, might only ju st match the residual funding gap, the case for public sector intervention needs to be seen in the light of the high risk that the Airport would not continue in operation without the investment in providing the RE SAs and at least the short runway extension. Overall, t he user benefits, discounted over the period to 2030, from having the short runway scheme in place would amount to some \u00a3220 million, suggesting a benefit to cost ratio well in excess of the cost of the investment even taking all the sunk costs and reinvested proceeds into account. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP xv Long Runway Extension 60. The additional funding requirement to provide the longer runway extension is some \u00a310 million on t he basis of current cost estimates, giving a funding gap on the same basis of \u00a318.4 million. Given the potential to serve a wider range of destinations with regional jet aircraft, the incremental user benefits from this option amount to some \u00a330 0 million discount ed over the period 2006 to 2030. There may be a case for supporting this larger scheme on the basis of incremental benef its to users. This longer runway scheme needs to be seen as a potential second phas e of development and the land safeguarded within the LDF in any event. 61. It should be pointed out that our appr aisal of costs and benefits presented above can only be provisional at this stage. However, it appears to us that the actual user benefits fr om retaining Plymouth City Airport and the potential benefits in terms of the contribution to achieving the Vision for Plymouth would justify a level of continued pub lic sector support. The 'do nothing' option, implying no further investment, r uns a high risk of the Airport closing as the threshold for operat ional viability would not be r eached, particularly as seems likely new airlines and air servic es cannot be attracted in sufficient quantity with the existing infrastructure. Further restrictions imposed by the CAA over time would be a further ri sk to continued commercial operations. 62. In these circumstances, some invest ment in further enhancement of airport facilities is essential to securing a l onger term future for the Airport. The short runway extension would appear to give greatest returns relative to the scale of investment. However, the work we have done to date does not represent a formal investment appraisal as this would require: 4 a fully detailed and costed scheme; 4 refinement of the market assessment in the light of recent airline developments; 4 confirmation of the proceeds from di sposal of the runway 06/24 land; 4 consideration of the extent to which the Cit y Council and SWRDA are prepared to reinvest any proceeds from land disposal; 4 confirmation from Sutton Harbour Hold ings of the extent of its further investment. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 1 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 York Aviation LLP, in conjunction with Faber Maunsell, was appointed to carry out the Plymouth City Airport Study for Plymouth City Council in August 2005. The study is aimed at informing both the preparation of the Local Development Framework for Plymout h and the Airport Company's own Master Plan. The overarching requirement for the study is to: \"provide a robust and comprehensive evidence base in relation to the case for an airport serving Plymouth for the foreseeable future, having regard to the wider regional context for a ir service provision.\" 1.2 The context for the current study is provided by the requirement for the City of Plymouth to prepare a Local Deve lopm ent Framework setting out the parameters for the physica l planning of the area and for the airport operator to produce a Master Plan to conform to the requirements of the Future of Air Transport White Paper. Local Development Framework 1.3 Currently Plymouth City Council is in the proc ess of preparing a Local Development Framework (LDF) in accordance with t he Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. This document will replace the existing Local Plan and will provide a strategi c planning framewor k for Plymouth. 1.4 In essence the Local Development Framework is a 'por tfolio' of local development documents to deliver a spatia l strategy for the City of Plymouth. The intention of the LDF is to improve and \"streamline\"1 the planning process and \"promote a proactive, positive approach to managing development\" 2. 1 Planning Policy 12: Local Development Frameworks, 2004, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Page 1 2 Ibid, Page 1 Plymouth City Airport Study 2 York Aviation LLP 1.5 In particular, the change from the traditional Local Pl an is des igned to create a planning framework that takes a sustainable approach to development, allows early consensus in preparation, rather than at later stages, and, importantly, provides a credible evidence base for schemes and policies included. The LDF will t hen be used with the Regional Spatial Strategy (the replacement for the Regional Planning Gu idance) to constitute the statutory Development Plan for the area. 1.6 The portfolio of documents included in the LDF will include a Core Strategy and Local Development Documents (LDDs - including Area Action Plans). The Core Strategy is a strategic docum ent is intended to provide a base for spatial planning to aid delivery of the vision and aspirations for Plymouth. The LDDs set out how different aspec ts of the Core Strategy will be delivered. Important ly, the Core Strategy will hav e a legal status in guiding decisions on planning applications, t hereby highlighting the importance of the LDDs being backed up by a credible evidence base. 1.7 Work on the LDF Core Strategy for Plymouth is still in progress, with submission to the Secretar y of State to be made in 20 06. The current Draft Core Strategy for Plymouth City includes the protection of land for a runway extension at Plymouth City Airport along with the principle of permitting non- airport development on other parts of the site. This policy is set out in an Interim Planning Statement 3 which proposes safeguarding of the land to the east of the Airport to prevent developm ent which would prej udice the current and/or future development of the Airport, pending pr oduction of the full strategic Master Plan. 1.8 A prime purpose of the current study is, therefore, to provide the evidenc e base needed to illustrate the need or ot herwise for the continued designation of these areas of land going forward into the Local Development Framework and to provide supporting evidence for Plymouth City Council to inform the Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) and other regional strategies. 3 Draft Interim Planning Statement 16 Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 3 Airport Master Plan 1.9 The operators of Plymouth City Airport are in the process of preparing an Airport Master Plan in accordance wit h The Future of Air Transport White Paper4 and following the advice set out in Guidance on the Preparation of Airport Master Plans5. 1.10 These plans should set out the proposals f or development to 2015 in \"some detail\" , with indicative plans covering the period to 2030. Notwithstanding the lack of a clear policy towards the development of Plymouth City Airport in the White Paper, as we discuss later, subsequent Guidance on the Preparation of Air port Master Plans indicated that the Ai rport was one of 30 airports required to produce a Ma ster Plan by the end of 2005. 1.11 The Guidance on the Preparation of Airport Master Plans doc ument outlines the Government's view t hat a Master Plan should: \"provide a clear statement of int ent on the part of t he airport operator that will enable future development of the airpor t to be given due consideration in local and regional planning processes .\" 6 1.12 The Master Plan process is seen by the Government as an opportunity for airports to undertake a balanced, evidence-based and open approach to airport planning as recommended in the Wh ite Paper. In theory, each airport should have published its Master Plan by the end of 2005, with this time period being set by the requirement to inform the local planning processes within the UK, and in particular the Local Development Framework process. Plymouth City Airport is not alone in not yet having published its Master Plan. 1.13 In addition to informing the planning proces s, the Government believes that there will be additional benefits from the publication of Airport Master Plans, namely7: 4 Department for Transport, The Future of Air Transport White Paper , December 2003 5 Department for Transport, Guidance on the Preparation of Airport Master Plans, July 2004 6 Ibid, para 9 7 Ibid, para 10 Plymouth City Airport Study 4 York Aviation LLP 4 \"they will provide an indication of an airport operator's plans for infrastructure development in the li ght of the high-level strategic policy framework for each airport in the White Paper, and therefore bring greater clarity and certainty for all those affected or with an interest; 4 they will inform long-term resour ce planning for local and regional players, particularly in the preparat ion of strategies and local plans; 4 they will make a useful tool fo r communic ating to a range of stakeholders, including airlines, fundi ng institutions, local authority and other local interests, to allow them to make well informed investment decisions; 4 they will he lp airport operators to make clear at an early stage the key milestones of their development proj ect such as the submission of a planning application, construction and opening; 4 they will provide a cons istent and public ly recognised vehicle for the Government, Devolved Administrations and their agencies to assess the progress being made in delivering the White Paper at each airport; 4 they will de monstrate the range of cost s and benefits of airport growth; and 4 they will en able airport operators and others to a ssess local social and environmental impacts (including t hose arising from land take and habitat loss) and provide an opportunity to develop preliminary proposals on how those impacts could be mitigated.\" 1.14 The Guidance sets out a requirement for Master Plans to cover the following 'core' areas8: 4 forecasts; 4 infrastructure proposals; 4 safeguarding and land/property take; 4 surface access initiatives; 4 impact on people and the natural envir onment (including economic and social impacts); 4 proposals to minimise and mitigate impacts. 8 Reference 5, para. 25. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 5 1.15 In the majority of cases, these documents will have no statutory basis. However, if the Master Plan is fully integrated into the Local Development Framework then it will have great er legal certainty. In the case of Plymouth, the LDF Core Strategy covers the pr inciple of a runway extension by designating land for this purpose and deals with potential release of some airport land for other uses, which will ta ke on a statutory status if approved in the LDF. Scope of this Report 1.16 In summary, Plymouth City Council and Plymouth City Airport wish to be informed on the economic impact and viabi lity of options for the development of Plymouth City Airport, including iss ues related to the environment, and an assessment of infrastructure needs and their affordability in the context of the Airport's future profitability. The brief stipulates that the study is to address the core areas identified in t he Guidance on Preparation of Airport Master Plans document. The brief outlines the scope of the study as: 4 creating a baseline assessment of the current economic, social and environmental impact of Plymouth City Airport; 4 generating passeng er and movement forecasts , including critical analysis of forecasts previously undertaken, exploring the effects on passenger figures of various scenarios , including a runway extension, and the interrelationship between growth at Plymouth and at neighbouring airports; 4 an assessment of existing infrastructure plans, the effects of these on the future viability and profitability of the Airport, and the requirement to safeguard land and property for any development; 4 an outline assessment of the environmental impact of the current and proposed future operations of the Airport and an examination of methods of mitigating the impact; 4 an econo mic impact assessment of the Airport under possible growth scenarios, in terms of its impact on the City of Plymouth and the wider South West. Plymouth City Airport Study 6 York Aviation LLP1.17 We have concentrated in this study on identifying the specific air travel needs of the Plymouth city region and particularly those deriving from the City Growth Strategy. We have sought to identify the specific need for Plymouth City Airport within that context and to ident ify options as to how that need can be met. 1.18 The key questions that we have set out to address in this study are: 4 How important is the existence and the growth of the Airport to the achievement of the vision for Plymouth? 4 What kind of airport does the City need? 4 Whether this is viable and deliverable in the longer term? 1.19 It is particularly important to note t hat whilst we are not tasked directly wit h considering the closure of the Air port, an assessment of the viability of development inevitably leads to consider ation of the overa ll viability of the Airport. Hence, we have made comparis ons within this report to the situation facing the City of Plymouth if th e Airport was to close. 1.20 Earlier studies, prior to the Futu re of Air Transport White Paper, als o identified options for new airport sites to serve Plymouth, with two sites being identified; one near Sherford in South Hams, and another to the north of the city. Of these two sites, the latter was rejected, we understand, due to adverse weather conditions which were likely to impact on operations. The site at Sherford has not been pursued, and indeed it is now identified within the Devon Structure Plan as a site for housing development, thereby ruling out any potential airport development. We have briefly reviewed options for alternative sites for an airport to serve Plymouth within this study, consideration of which was added to the brief in December 2005. Structure of the Report 1.21 The remainder of this report is structured as follows: 4 in Section 2 , we briefly describe Plymouth City Airport Today ; Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 7 4 in Section 3 , we set out the Planning Policy Context for the development of the Airport; 4 in Section 4, we set out the Economic Context for the City of Plymouth and describe our discussions with stakeholders; 4 in Section 5 , we present our assessment of the Market for Ply mouth City Airport; 4 in Section 6 , we outline the Economic Impact of the Airport , both in the current baseline case and extr apolated to 2030 under a number of scenarios ; 4 in Section 7 , we discuss the Development Options and issues related to viability; 4 in Section 8, we outline the baseline and future Environmental Impact ; 4 in Section 9, we outline the baseline and future Surface Access Issues ; 4 in Section 10 , we discuss the availability of Alternative Airport Sites ; 4 in Section 11 , we bring together our Conclusions relating to the future of Plymouth City Airport. Plymouth City Airport Study 8 York Aviation LLP2 PLYMOUTH CITY AIRPORT TODAY Key Points 4 Plymouth City Airport is owned and operated by Sutton Harbour Holdings on a 150 year lease from Plymouth City Council. 4 Operations at the Airport are restricted due to the short runway length and the lack of full provision of Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). Currently, the Airport is limited to existing aircraft types until a RESA is provided at the eastern end of the main runway. 4 Following the commencement of operations by Air Southwest, operating services on a regional low fares model, the Airport had been experiencing strong growth in 2005, although the recent cessation of operations by Air Wales, coupled with the threat of a movement cap by the CAA has resulted in growth stalling in the short term. 2.1 Plymouth City Airport is owned and operated by Sutt on Harbour Holdings o n a 150 year lease from Plymouth City Coun cil, which retains the freehold to the airport site. The Airport is loca ted at Roborough, to the north of the urban area, adjacent to Derriford Hospital and to the College of St Mark and St John (MARJON). The Airport occupi es a constrained site, encircled by housing and other development. Infrastructure 2.2 Plymouth City Airport has 2 operational runways, with the primary runway (13/31) having a length of 1,161met res (with a Take-Off Run Available [TORA] of 1,109m and 1, 102m dependent on direction). A shorter length cross runway (06/24) of 752m is used presently for training, general aviation and helicopter movements. 2.3 The future of the Airport was placed under serious threat by the requirement for increased runway end safety areas (RESAs) to be provided due to changes in aerodrome licensing requirem ents imposed by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in 2001/2. At the time, there was concern that this would have placed the continuat ion of the key service to London Gatwick in jeopardy. We have taken into account earlier studies into the economic importance of this link in preparing this Report. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 9 2.4 In 2004, a RESA was provided at the western end of the main runway, which involved diversion of the A386. T he development of this new RESA, essential to allow continuation of co mmercial scheduled flights to Gatwick and other UK points was funded in pa rt by the South West Regional Development Agency (SWRDA). We return to the implicatio ns of the funding agreement later in this Report. 2.5 Following completion of the western RESA, commercial scheduled operations at the Airport were able to continue, as we describe below. However, in September 2005, the CAA indicated that it still required the provision of an undershoot RESA at t he eastern end of runway 13/31 if commercial operations at the Airport were to be allowed to grow. An absolute limit on commercial movements was originally proposed until the eastern RESA is constructed, but this was relaxed in December 2005 to a limitation on operations to those using existing aircraft types. 2.6 Such restrictions potentially have signifi c ant implications for the future role of the Airport, as growth in operations is fundamental to securing viability. The CAA's stance strongly suggests that the Airport's ability to grow and secure profitability remains vulner able until such time as the required eastern RESA is provided. The CAA has also indicat ed that it would pref er the Airport to move to the provision of full lengt h RESAs at both runway ends. We describe the implications of constr ucting these RESAs and the relationship to the options for developing an ext ension to the main runway in Section 7 . 2.7 Furthermore, without an extension, the le ngth of the main runway is shorter than other city airports in Europe, including London City and Sheffield City Airports, with the latter of these strugglin g to attract services as airlines have been concerned about the operational re strictions on a runway of this length9. Recently Plymouth City Air port has handled scheduled services provided by Bombardier Dash8-300 an d ATR-42 aircraft. We discuss in Section 5 , the growth prospect for the Plymouth City Airport market and the implications for runway l ength and other facilities. 9 The runway length at Sheffield City Airport has been further reduced and the Airport now only accepts single engine aircraft and helicopters, and may close completely in the future Plymouth City Airport Study 10 York Aviation LLP 2.8 The passenger terminal is located to the south east of t he main runway. Adjacent to the passenger terminal are hangars used by the flying school, MoD FOST and by Air South West. A more detailed analysis of the infrastructure issues and requirements is contained within Section 7 of this report. It should be noted that the locati on of the Airport in close proximity to housing also raises environmental concerns which are discussed in Section 8. Operations 2.9 Until autumn 2003, Brit ish Airways (through its s ubsidiary, BA CitiExpress10) was the only scheduled service operator at the Airport. The airline traditionally charged relatively high fares for services from the Airport, and this led to a perception of Plymouth City Airport being primarily for business travellers, serving a limited role supporting (mainly outbound) tourism. 2.10 However, in late 2003, after a decis io n by British Airways to withdraw from services at Plymouth City Airport, a new airline commenced operations, Air Southwest, which is also owned by Sutt on Harbour Holdings. Air Southwest operates a low fare regional airline model, which is more attractive to leisure travellers. In addition, Air Wales also commenced services from the Airport to Cardiff, Cork and Dublin, alt hough these latter services have been suspended recently. 11 The destinations and weekly frequencies to each in March 2006 are illustrated in Table 2.1. 2.11 In addition to the recent changes to servic es by Air Wales, Air Southwest has announced alterations to their schedules, reducing frequencies to Manchester from April, but bringing Leeds into the network as a direct destination (without the need to change aircra ft at Bristol). In addition, Air Southwest has announced new services and schedules from Newquay and Cardiff airports. 10 formerly Brymon Airways 11 More recently Air Wales ceased operating scheduled services completely so its withdrawal from the Plymouth market does not of itself imply that the routes could not be viably operated by other airlines. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 11 Table 2.1: Destinations and Weekly Frequencies from Plymouth City Airport Airline Destination Weekly Frequency Air Southwest Bristol 12 Jersey 7 Leeds 7* London Gat wick 28 Manchester 12** Notes: * Change aircraft in Bristol ** Aircraft stops at Bristol Source: Airline Timetables 2.12 Discussions with the airline sugges t that the schedule changes were undertaken at Plymouth to improve the re liability of services, as the need to await transferring passengers at Bristol c an cause significant delays to their overall network. The decision to launc h new services from Newquay and not Plymouth was made whilst the Airport was operatin g under daily movement restrictions as a result of the CAA's September decision ( and before it was known that Air Wales would be suspendi ng some services). At the time, Air Southwest did not believe it had the scope to laun ch new services from Plymouth and could not anticipate the la ter relaxation of the movement limit in December 2005. The airline has stressed that the decisions regarding changed operations a nd a lack of expansion in 20 06 are not a reflection of its commitment to Plymouth and that it will be keen to launch new services from the Airport when it has additional aircraft available and now the movement limit has been relaxed. 2.13 The CAA reported12 that, in 2004, the Airport handled 104,000 passengers, representing an increase of 52% over 2003. In the early part of 2005 passenger figures were showing growth over the same periods in 2004, however, as a result of more recent route changes by Air Wales and with the initial threat of a movement cap, t he final year end passenger total for the Airport was only 109,000 13, level on the previous year. 12 CAA Airport Statistics 13 Terminal Passengers Only Plymouth City Airport Study 12 York Aviation LLP2.14 The rolling 12 month passenger figures can be seen in Figure 2.1 and illustrate a continued increase in passe nger traffic over the period from January 2004, shortly after the withdrawal of British Airways' CitiExpress. Whilst the peak of passengers handled was 125,000 in 2001, prior to the loss of British Airways' services, the current 12-month rolling total shows that the Airport had been experiencing rapid growth towards previous passenger levels until the withdrawal of Air Wales and the threat of restriction. With the Air Southwest pattern of low fare servic es, this pattern of growth would be expected to continue in the medium term, provided that the Airport is not movement constrained. Figure 2.1: Rolling 12 Month Passenger Totals for Plymouth CAA Statistics 2.15 We consider the scope for further gr owth and the criticality of both runway length and potential movem ent restrictions in Section 5 . Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 13 3 PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Key Points 4 The Future of Air Transport White Paper leaves decisions regarding expansion at Plymouth City Airport to local and regional decision making. 4 The Draft Regional Spatial Strategy notes the potential role of Plymouth City Airport to achieving the scale of growth planned for Plymouth and is supportive of improvements to the Airport, including a runway extension, new terminal facilities and improved surface access. 4 The RSS also recognises the role of air services in overcoming the peripherality of the area. 4 The Plymouth City Growth Strategy and the Vision for Plymouth set out the step changes needed in the image and performance of the City. The Airport has the potential to contribute to realising these changes in performance. 4 The Draft Local Development Framework is supportive of the Airport, including safeguarding land to the east for a runway extension and providing for commercial development on part of the land occupied by runway 06/24. 3.1 The context for this study is set by the need to inform the preparation of the new Plymouth City Local Development Framework and to a llow Plymouth City Council to inform the emerging Regi onal Spatial Strategy and Regional Transport Strategy processes. 3.2 The brief sets out the policy background which the study must take account of in order to meet Plym outh Cit y Council's requirements. In particular, the brief acknowledges the following documents as relevant: 4 The current and emerging Re gional Spatial Strategy; 4 The emerging Regiona l Transport Strategy; 4 The Future of Air Transport White Paper (2003); 4 Planning Policy Statement 1: De livering Sustainable Development; 4 The City Growth Strategy; 4 A Vision for Plymouth (2003), often referred to as 'The Mackay Vision'. Plymouth City Airport Study 14 York Aviation LLP 3.3 We have also considered the Sout h West Reg ional Economic Strategy (RES), the existing Plymouth City Council Adopted Local Plan (for which the LDF will provide a replacement docum ent) and the Devon Structure Plan (2001 to 2016) as relevant. We summa rise the key elements of the policy background in the following paragraphs. National Policy The Future of Air Transport White Paper 3.4 The White Paper specific ally identifies the importance of airpor ts to their local and regional economies: \"Airports are an important focus for t he development of local and regional economies. They attract business and generate employment and open up wider markets. They can provide an important im petus to regeneration and a focus for new commercial and industrial development.\"14 3.5 In relation to the devel opment of regional airports, the White Paper sets out clearly the Government's support for thei r further development, particularly in the context of relieving pressure on the London and South East airports: \"The Government's policy is to encourage the growth of regional airports to serve regional and local demand, subjec t to envir onmental constraints. This will have a number of benefits, including: supporting the growth of the ec onomies of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and t he English regions; relieving congestion at more over-cro wded airports, particularly in the South East, and therefore making better use of existing capacity; reducing the need for long-distance travel to and from airports; and 14 Department for Transport, The Future of Air Transport (December 2003), para. 4.24. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 15 giving passengers greater choice.\"15 3.6 However, the Future of Air Transpor t White Paper is somewhat ambivalent about the future role of Plymouth City Airport, whilst noting the importance of allowing the City of Plymout h to continue to benefit fr om air connections to a number of domestic points and onwar d connections to international destinations. The White Paper states: \"During the consultation a proposal was put forward for a new airport to the east of Ply mouth. As this was not cove red by the consultation, we have not reached conclusions on it. The Governme nt is content, therefore, for this issue to be considered by regional an d local authorities, having regard to the alternatives. These are to extend the r unway at Plymouth City Airport, or to take advantage of air services availabl e from other airports in the region potentially capable of serving the Plymouth catchment area.\"16 3.7 The White Paper notes that decisions regarding long-te rm solutions for air access serving Plymouth should be taken at a regional level. This creates a clear context for the current study in terms of the need to identify the optimum solution to meeting the air tr avel needs of the Plymouth City Region in support of the wider regeneration vision. 3.8 Prior to the publication of the White Paper, the South West Regional Development Agency (SWRDA), in conj unction with the Regional Assembly and Government Office, commissioned a study into the role of the airports serving the Far South West17. This informed both the Region's response to the consultation prior to the White Paper and the preparat ion of the White Paper itself. It is worth noting that the SWRDA response to the consultation called for further economic analysis of the case for Plymouth City Airport to define its potential role further but gave a clear rejection of the proposed new site option both as it was unlikely to be viable in a reasonable timescale and taking into account the potential for development of Ex eter Airport. 15 Ibid, para. 4.35. 16 Ibid, para. 10.26. 17 Development of an Air Transport Strategy for the Far South West, Aviasolutions 2003 Plymouth City Airport Study 16 York Aviation LLP 3.9 The White Paper sets out a requirement for regional and local plans and strategies to take on board the policies fo r airports set out in the Future of Air Transport White Paper. Howev er, in the case of Plymouth City Airport, the case for development and the extent of that development is still to be made, placing significant onus on the out put of the current study. 3.10 A further consideration for this study is how development of the Airport is to be funded, particular in view of the high cost of providing the eastern RESA and a runway extension if they are deemed necessary, as we will discuss later in this report. The White Paper does envisage circumstances where the public sector may support the develop ment of regional airports or air services serving them, noting that: \"However, some exceptions to this [c ommercial] approach m ay occur where: s mall local airports are owned by loca l authorities or by the Scottish Executive. Some of these airports require deficit funding to cover operating costs and investment in new capacity, but in return offer important accessibility, economic or social benef its to the catchment areas which they serve; or airports fall within Objective 1 or 2 Areas. In these cases, applications for public funding to help finance investment in new capacity will be considered on their merits on a case by case basis, provided there is clear evidence that the project is not fundable commercially, after account is tak en of an appropriate contribution from airport charges to cover the costs of additional infrastructure. The proposals will have to offer good relative value for money and not be anti-competitive. In each of these circumstances, so m e limited public funding may be appropriate provided it is clearly ju stified by the contribution that the development of the airport can make to wider employment creation, regeneration, social incl usion and regional and loca l economic development programmes.\"18 3.11 This creates a context in which p ublic sector funding support for Plymouth City Airport may be considered, particu larly given the Objective 2 areas within Plymouth and the adjacent Objective 1 area in Cornwall. 18 Future of Air Transport White Paper, paras. 4.36/4.37 Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 17 Regional Planning and Policy Frameworks Regional Spatial Strategy 3.12 Regional Planning Gui dance for the South West is set out in Regional Planning Guidance (RPG10), which under the new planning system is now known as the Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS). A new draft RSS is due to be published for consultation in 2006 and when complete this will provide a replacement for the RPG. This will be required to incorporate the policy on airports set out in the Future of Air Transport White Paper. 3.13 RPG10 set out the following aims for its policy towards airports in the South West as to: 4 \"Support the existing airports and airfield s in the region to develop their respective roles to serve air travel needs; 4 Im prove surface links and public transport to airports, particularly at Bristol, E xeter and Bournemouth, taking into account the results of the surface access strategies prepar ed by the Air Transport Forum s; 4 Protect land (including through Public Safety Zones) around airports to secure operational integrity.\"19 3.14 RPG10 makes no direct mention of Plymouth City Airport, although all three policy aims would be of importance in considering the issues for developing a Master Plan. RPG10 does suggest that all of the airports in the region have a complementary role, thereby not favouring development of one over another. 3.15 The current (January 2006) draft of the RSS address es airports at Policy TR7, which states: 19 Policy TRAN 9: Airports Plymouth City Airport Study 18 York Aviation LLP \"Airports within the region should m eet an increasing proportion of regional demand for air travel to reduce 'lea kage' to other re gions and the London airports with the expected growth met by developing the major existing airports in the region - Br istol, Exeter and Bournemo uth. Other airports will satisfy important local markets, e. g. Newquay, Plymout h and Staverton (Gloucester). Plymouth/Newquay shoul d continue to provide business links to international hubs and London while fa cilitating tourist visits into the region. Local authorities, airport operators and other agenc ies will provide improvements to aviation facilities and access to airports (including public transport) in the region to meet futu re development requirements consistent with the overall transport stra tegies for the urban areas.\" 3.16 However, it should also be noted t hat there are concer ns expressed about the sustainability of air transport growth within the context of the strategy overall, although the benefit s of reducing long surfac e journeys by road and the benefits of reducing t he perception and realit y of peripherality are recognised. 3.17 The Report of Consultation also high lights that respondents considered that there was a role for the Region's airports in promoting economic competitiveness and attracting investment and supporting tourism. In discussing the Plymouth and South East Cornwall ar ea, the draft RSS notes the importance of the r egeneration of the Plymout h City economy and the need for accelerated economic growth and a step change in performance. Amongst the factors seen as enabling such growth is \"Delivering the scale of growth at Plymouth will requ ire significant investment in infrastructure to enable increased economic and residential development.\" 20 3.18 The draft RSS goes on to note the im portance of investm ent in transport infrastructure to support the econom ic development of the Plymouth sub- region, including: \"improvements to Plymouth airport includ ing runway extension, new terminal facilities and surface access\"21 20 Draft RSS (January 2006), Policy SR53 21 Ibid. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 19 The draft RSS then calls for the LDD to \"fully quantify the potential benefits from Plymouth airport to the economy\" ; a requirement which this study is intended to address. Regional Transport Strategy 3.19 The Regional Transport Strategy is being updated as part of the RSS review. Developing the Regional Transpor t Strategy in the South West was produced in 2004 as a contribution toward s a full review of the Regional Transport Strategy and identifies short term priorities for in vestment. It notes that key issues for the South West re late, inter alia, to peripherality and to the role of transport in accessibility and soci al exclusion. This is identified as a particular issue for the far South West, served by Plymouth City Airport. It is noted that: \"Improved air services are essential to minimise the impact of peripherality on the South West and to support developme nt of the economy of the region.\"22 3.20 The medium term strategy for the development of airports in the South West is set out, with an emphasis on using sp are capacity at Bris tol, Exeter and Bournemouth Airports. Other airpor ts, including Newquay and Plymouth, are assumed to have niche roles, without such roles being defined. However, the importance of air links to the far South West is made clear by the suggestion that such links may need to be sustained by the imposition of public service obligations. The important role of airports in supporting the development of tourism is also noted. 22 Developing the Regional Transpor t Strategy in the South West , South West Regional Assembly, September 2004, para. 5.34 Plymouth City Airport Study 20 York Aviation LLP Regional Economic Strategy 3.21 The Regional Economic Strategy (RES) is currently under review, with the post consultation draf t published in February 200623. The RES aims to improve regional communications as specified in Priority 3A. Links to key markets in London and the South East and the long journey times to the Far South West are highlighted. 3.22 The RES identifies key sectors to be supported by the Region, and many of these are also identified within t he policies and documents specific to Plymouth. The priority sector s identified in the RES are: 4 Advanced Engineering; 4 Food and Drink; 4 ICT; 4 Creative Industries; 4 E nvironmental Technologies; 4 Bio-medical; 4 Tourism; and 4 Marine. 3.23 Several of these key sectors have a strong presence and scope for growth in the Plymouth area, notabl y bio-medical, advanced engineering, marine, tourism and creative industries. 23 Regional Economic Strategy for The South West of England, 2006 - 2015, South West Regional Development Agency February 2006 Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 21 3.24 In 2002, the South West Regi onal Development Agency (SWRDA) commissioned a study titled 'The South We st Economic State of the Region Report'. This document considered the Region as a whole, thereby reflecting the economic effects of Swi ndon and Bristol in the area. Broadly, though, the report illustrate s that the South West economy is dominated by firms employing less than 10 people24, although in employ ment terms around three quarters of jobs ar e in medium-large enterpris es. The report highlights that, compared to other regions, t he South West has only a few large businesses, with only 7 of the top 100 companies in the UK having a presence in the region in 200225. 3.25 Importantly, the repor t highlights the Region's low reliance on exports26, suggesting that 16% of the Region's GDP is reliant upon exports compared to the UK average of 20%. The Region attracts only 7% of the UK's inward investment projects, with the value of these being lower than average, with this being largely drawn to Bristol and Swindon, and therefore missing the far South West including Plymouth. Devon Structure Plan 3.26 The Devon Structure Plan (2001 - 2016) focuses upon both airp orts in the County, Exeter International and Plymouth City. The current version of this document was adopted in October 2004, and therefore provides for the policies contained in the Future of Ai r Transport White Paper, published in December 2003. Furthermore, this document was published after a year of low cost carrier operations at Plymouth by Air Southwest. 3.27 The Structure Plan identifies Ply mouth City Airport as having: 24 South West Economic State of the region Report, South West Regional Development Agency, 2002, Executive Summary 25 Ibid, Executive Summary 26 Ibid, Executive Summary Plymouth City Airport Study 22 York Aviation LLP \"..an important sub regiona l role in m eeting busine ss needs, particularly by providing feeder services to London. The need to retain and provide for these links will continue to be impor tant throughout the Plan period. Passenger numbers are expected to grow to about 500,000 by 2030\"27 3.28 The document sets out its policy towards airports, requiring that the role of Exeter and Plymouth City Air ports should be expanded by: 4 \"Im proving air service accessibilit y and developing direct links to international service networks; 4 Developin g new passenger and other related facilities; 4 Providing for improved surface links to the strategic major road and rail network; 4 Im proving public transport access\"28 City of Plymouth Local Plan (1995-2011) 3.29 The current City of Plym outh Local Plan s ets out a vision for Plymouth in 2020, which is: \"for Plymouth to grow as an outst anding regional centre , renowned for its quality of living, and as a ci ty wit h a strong sense of id entity in the world. The City's regional role ......... will onl y be achieved through an urban renaissance affecting all aspects of Plymouth's economic social and environmental fabric.29 3.30 Within this vision, there are clear ta rgets for the diversification of the local economy, away from dependence on defence related industries. 27 Para. 5.92 28 Policy T14 29 City of Plymouth Local Plan (1995-2011), First Deposit, Aim 1: Economic Growth and Plymouth's Regional Role Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 23 3.31 The vision for Plymouth also stresses the importance of the city as a sub- regional centre for South East Cornwall and South West Devon. The City's global links are seen as particularly important to the lo cal and regional economy, with a wide range of Nort h American, Asi an and European companies operating within t he City, including those in key sectors such as medical and healthcare and the higher education sector. 3.32 As part of the achievement of this vision, strategic communication links ar e identified as being of key importance, particularly given that Plymouth is relatively remote geographically from the economic core of Europe. The Local Plan, therefore, seeks to: \"support the improvement of Plymouth Airport to secure and develop its contribution to Ply mouth and its sub-region.\" 3.33 The Plan's policy towards the Airport is that: \"Plymouth City Airport is a vital part of the economic development potential of Ply mouth and the sub-region. It meets regional business needs with feeder services to London, helping reduc e the effects of peripherality, and contributes towards economic development and inward investment\"30 and that airport development proposals shou ld comply with the following: 4 \"High qualit y design given the site's city gateway role; 4 Avoid undue har m to residential amenit y, visual amenity or highway safety; 4 Im provements to surface access by a choice of transport modes where development generates significant increases in passenger numbers; 4 The use of public art as an integral part of proposals.\"31 30 Part Three: Proposals, Page 30. 31 Para. 75 Plymouth City Airport Study 24 York Aviation LLP 3.34 These documents will need to be replaced by new policies and strategies set out under the Local Development Framew ork (LDF), which forms the context for gathering evidence regarding the role of Plymouth City Airport in the current study. Plymouth City Growth Strategy 3.35 The Plymouth City Growth Strategy (CGS)32 was published in 2004 and sets out its strategic objectives33 as being: 4 To achieve business growth through the development of clusters and target sectors; 4 To increas e the rate of business st art-ups, by promoting a culture of entrepreneurship and supporting the formation of new businesses; 4 To improve the delivery and co-ordinati on of business support and econo mic development initiatives; 4 To ensure that the right conditions are provided for business growth, by working with partners to enhance the ci ty' s infrastructure, image and environment.\" 3.36 The strategy tackles the issue of Pl ymouth's image, suggesting that it has an \"image problem\" both externally but also internally, and that these perceptions have an impact on business by: \"..making it harder to attract or hold tourists, investors, entrepreneurs and em ployees.\"34 The CGS is essentially suggesting that if the image and perception of Plymouth as a place to live and work can be improved, this could have genuine benefits for economic growth. 32 City Growth Strategy, Plymouth - Main Strategy, Plymouth Business Growth, 2004 33 Ibid, Section 4.2 34 City Growth Strategy Plymouth - Main Strategy , Plymouth Business Growth, 2004, Section 6.1 Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 25 3.37 The City Growth Strategy identifies poor transport link s as a key weakness, highlighting concern by local companies of a lack of air services to London Heathrow.35 However, the strategy is not specific about the ongoing need for development of Plymouth City Airport, nor does it go on to discuss in further detail the need for air service development and how this relates to economic development. A survey of 53 firms36 conducted as part of the CGS to look at the key strengths of Plymouth suggeste d that 'Access to Markets' and 'Transport Links' are the most pressing issues for firms. 3.38 In November 2003, as a part of the CGS work, a Cluster Identification and Analys is report was published. This was a working paper to inform the decisions regarding business clusters to be targeted in the CGS37. Of these, the Medical and Healthcare sector was considered the most viable when considered against a number of criter ia, followed closely by the Marine sector, then Advanced Engi neering, Tourism and Telecoms. Creative Media and Business Services appeared margina lly less viable when considered against the same criteria, but have been included in the CGS. A Vision for Plymouth 3.39 'A Vision for Plymouth', widely referred to as the 'Mackay Vision' 38 sets out a plan to improve the urban fabric and image of Pl ymouth and was prepared by MBM Architiques. Although essent ially a physical planning and urban design document, it does identify aspira tions for the wider development of Plymouth development, including a grow th in population from the current 240,00039 to 300-350,000; the level belie ved necessary to secure a sustainable and vibrant city. This target population is suggested as the level of critical mass required to support a ci ty of the nature outlined in the vision. 3.40 The Vision focuses on the unique beauty and position of the City, and identifies that: 35 Ibid, Section 3.3 36 Ibid, Figure 2 37 Plymouth City Growth Strategy: Cluster Identific ation and Analysis Final Report, November 2003, Plymouth Business Growth 38 A Vision For Plymouth , MBM Architects, October 2003 39 Census 2001 Plymouth City Airport Study 26 York Aviation LLP \"..it seems to fall way short of its pot ential o ffer for lifestyle, workplace and urban attracter that this uniquely positioned and naturally endowed waterside city should be able to provide to a waiting population40.\" 3.41 Specifically, the Vision identifies parallels with Glasgow, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle and Liverpool as cities with hi gh levels of deprivation in recent years but which have been regenerated into Europ ean cultural cities41. It makes clear that the provision of improved air service access would permit the City to improve its posit ion in the hierarchy of Eu ropean cities. However, it does not make any attempt to support this statement with evidence42. 3.42 The report discusses the link between economic growth and the possibility for the transformation of the City in line with the outlined sc hemes. The Vision focuses on the physical regenerat ion of the City and development of its cultural facilities in order to attract inward in vestment and the associated high earning employees. Such employees will seek not only an improvement to the qualit y of life in Plymouth but improved accessibility. 3.43 The Vision suggests that the initiative s required to improve the cultural style of the City will also be t he drivers for diversification in tourism towards short stay city breaks, within a waterfront location, comparable with the attractions of Newcastle or Leeds. We discuss t he implications of the Vision and the link between implementat ion and the role of the Airport further in the next section. LDF Core Strategy Document 3.44 Preparation of the Pl ymouth City Council Local De velopment Framework Core Strategy has been an on-going pr ocess through 2005. In March, a number of 'Issues and Options' papers we re produced, followed in July 2005 by the publication of the 'Preferred Op tions' document. The Core Strategy aims to support the vision for a transfo rmation of the City in terms of both economic and physical growth. 40 A Vision For Plymouth , MBM Architects, October 2003, Page 17 41 Ibid. Page 25 42 Ibid Page 19 Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 27 3.45 In particular, Preferred Option 3 highlights the aim: \"To see Plymouth established by 2016 as a city of trul y international quality, founded on principles of sustainable development.....\" 43 3.46 The same option outlines what the City should be providing to achieve the Vision. Amongst others, these include: 4 \"A city of choice, with a healthy, gr owing population, which is realis ing its potential as one of Europe's finest; 4 Quality employ ment provision - enabl ing the City to realise its potent ial as the economic engine room of the far south west, spreading the benefits of investment to all; 4 Exception al shopping, cultural, educat ion and health care facilities; 4 A transformed public transport network; 4 Im proved communication links with the rest of the country and Europe .\" This analysis suggests a key role for air transport locally as an alternative to road/rail in terms of improving communication links. 3.47 Preferred Option 47 relates to t he area surrounding and including Plymout h City Airport. The intention would be to \"create a new centre for Northern Plymouth at Derriford\"44. Among the stated aims related to the wider development of the area, the option aims to safeguard the long-term position of the Airport. The option designates a section of land currently occupied by runway 06/24 of the Airport as Resi dential/Mixed use land, allowing for development of alternative uses, whils t at the same time safeguarding the remaining airport land and designating land to the eas t of the current runway 13/31 as land \" safeguarded for potential extension to runway .\" 43 Plymouth City Council Local Development Framework: Core Strategy Preferred Options - July 2005, Plymouth City Council, para 4.24 44 Plymouth City Council Local Development Framework: Core Strategy Preferred Options - July 2005, Plymouth City Council, para 30.5 Plymouth City Airport Study 28 York Aviation LLP Derriford and Southway Area Planning Framework 3.48 This planning framework encompasses the area surrounding and including Plymouth City Airport. This is not a policy document, but rather an evidenc e base to inform the LDF process. It was compiled on the basis that the area has not been well planned to date, and that a suitab le planning document could: \"..create an urban area which is attractive, host to a wide range of uses, well linked both between its par ts and outwards, and functionally efficient\" 45 3.49 The document is clear that any future development to the east of the Airport should not prejudice its cu rrent or future operation or expansion. Indeed, the document is clear that the suggestions for development in the area have been determined upon based on the possibility of changes to the configuration of the Air port, including the closure of runway 06/24, and the possible extension of runway 13/31. Conclusion 3.50 It is clear that locally there is considerable support for a continued and strengthened role for Plymout h City Airport, albeit that the policies are not specific about how this is to be achi eved. The overarchi ng policy context, as set out in the Future of Air Transport White Paper and being cascaded down into regional policy and planning frameworks withi n which the Plymouth City LDF will reside, is less clear about the ro le of the Airport. However, the more recent RSS review indicates support fo r the niche role of the Airport in supporting the regeneration of the Plymouth sub-r egion and goes onto lend support to the provision of a runway extension and new te rminal, subject to the benefits to the ec onomy being demonstrated. 45 Derriford and Southway Development Framew ork, Draft Final Report, April 2005, Page 1 Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 29 3.51 There is a consistent vision for the future economic development of the Plymouth City Region through all the strategy documents; that is the need to achieve a step change in the economy through modernisation of the infrastructure in order to halt the recent period of economic decline. Consistently the role of air transport links is highlighted as being crucial to achieving the economic goals. Howeve r, there is no subs tantiated evidence of this dependency currently availabl e through the policy documents. 3.52 It is within this contex t that there is a need for a sound, economically based, case to be made to support the conti nued development of the Airport within the framework of the policies set out fo r the Plymouth and t he other airports. This creates a clear background for the cu rrent study to both define the role of Plymouth City Airport in relation to the economic needs of the local area and to secure its development on a fina ncially viable basis whilst having regard to: 4 the peripherality of th e Plymouth sub-region; and 4 the link between air transport pr ovision and economic growth. Plymouth City Airport Study 30 York Aviation LLP4 PLYMOUTH CITY ECONOMIC CONTEXT Key Points 4 The employment structure in Plymouth is moving away from traditional sectors such as fishing and manufacturing towards knowledge based industries such financial services and health industries. 4 Although there has been a decline in MoD activity at the Dockyard, naval activities still make an important economic contribution to the City. The Airport plays a role in sustaining the naval presence in Plymouth. 4 The decline in the naval presence is forcing changes in the economy to reduce dependency on the MoD. However, much of the new work is regional rather than global in character and hence not dependent on air service accessibility. 4 The City Growth Strategy foresees cluster growth in the advanced engineering, business services, creative industries, mari ne industries, medical and healthcare, and tourism and leisure sectors. These sectors are amongst those with a high dependence on air travel. 4 Infrastructure and access are seen as amongst the key growth drivers in implementing the City Growth Strategy, with improving connectivity seen as a priority both by surface means and using the Airport. 4 The role of the Airport is likely to become more significant as the City achieves the growth outlined in the Vision. 4 sues in terms of the quality of hotels and attractions which need to be tackled first. 4 e, particularly for domestic trips, with the London air link being viewed as essential. 4 ortant role supporting activity at Derriford Hospital and the 4 without which some of these activities might relocate away from Plymouth.

The Airport also plays a particular role in supporting Flag Officer Sea Training for the MoD and in the training of naval pilots, 4.1 ility of the future economic vision and the necessary conditions for success. In this section, we examine the current economic position and the future economic v ision for the City of Plymouth in more detail. The section includes the views of stakeholders and interested parties about the viabPlymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 31 Current Economic Position 4.2 Plymouth's economic history has been shaped by its natural harbour, which has led to a strong maritime history, covering naval, fishing and commercial operations. Indeed, the naval base drov e employment in the Dockyard to a peak of around 40,00046 and provided for economic and population growth. 4.3 Subsequent reductions in the scale of the naval bas e, and the privatisation of the Dockyard, have led to major re ductions in the number of local residents employed in this sector. Wi th the decline of the dockyard, the City has been successful at a ttracting new manufacturing jobs to the area, although overall this sector has also seen decline in recent years. 4.4 The South West Economic State of the Region Report47 shows Plymouth having a GDP per head index of 99.2, with the index of 100 being the South West average (based on 1998 data). This puts Plymouth ahead of areas such as Torbay, Somerset and Cornwa ll, but behind Bath (119.5) and Bristol (130.2). The same report ranks the Region as 7th in terms of GDP (out of a total of 11 regions within t he UK), indicating that Plymouth as a city has a relatively weak GDP compar ed to other key UK cities. 4.5 The City Growth Strategy48 outlines the main sector s of employment within Plymouth in 2001. These are shown in Table 4.1. 4.6 Table 4.1 illustrates well the changing nature of the Plymouth Economy, with most changes in employment over the period 1998-20 01 being either significant increases or significant dec reases, as Plymouth moves away from older industries, such as Fishing and Manufacturing, towards more knowledge based industries, such as Financial Services and Health Industries. 46 Plymouth City Growth Strategy, Plymouth Business Growth, 2004, Page 9 47 The South West Economic State of the R egion Report, South West Regional Development Agency, 2002 48 Ibid Plymouth City Airport Study 32 York Aviation LLPAgriculture and Fishing 0.1 1 -36.3 Energy and Water 0.8 0.8 57.1 Manufacturing 14.8 14 -4.7 Construction 3 4.5 4.6 Distribution, Hotels and Restaurants 19.9 24.1 2.1 Transport and Communications 5.1 6.1 42.6 Banking, Finance, Insurance etc. 16 19.5 43.8 Public Administration, Education and Health 29.3 24.1 15.9 Other Servcies 4.4 5.2 30.8 Armed Forces (est.) 6.6 0.7 N/ATable 4.1: Plymouth Employment by Industry, 2001 Source: Plymouth City Growth Strategy% Change in Employment 1998 -2001% of GB Employment% of EmploymentIndustry 4.7 In discussion, it has b een put to us that whilst manufacturing appears to be declining, it is more a case of it c hanging in character, moving away from heavy manufacturing towards light m anufacturing, of high value products such as pharmaceuticals. This is re flected in a decline in employment but not necessarily in the im portance of the sector. 4.8 It is estimated that at least 10,000 jobs were directly or indirectly linked to the tourism sector in Plymouth in 1999.49 The current tourism offer is mainly based around the histor y of the City. South West Tourism, the regional tourist board, indicated that most visi tors to Plymouth do so as part of a longer holiday in the ar ea and consequently many do not stay overnight or spend significant sums of money in the City. Typically these tourists are reliant on their car (or in many cases coach) for travel. 49 City of Plymouth Local Plan (1995-2011) Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 33 4.9 Whilst the City has seen ec onomic growth, it is clear that some sectors may be more v aluable than others. The City has been successful at attracting call centres for example, but there is a feeling that these types of activities are not sustainable, primar ily due to the risk of this type of work being relocated abroad as a result of cheaper labour. Also, to an extent, some developments may have been attracted by incentives linked to European Union Objective 1 and Obje ctive 2 funding, and conse quently there is a risk that some firms may move on again in the future, although no specific examples have been given that this has actually taken place to date. 4.10 Despite a decline in MoD activity at the Dockyard, the Navy still plays an important role withi n the City. A recent arti cle in the Western Morning News50 illustrates the importance of t he Devonport dockyard and naval base, key points include that they: 4 generate \u00a3359 million of income fo r Devon and Cornwall, around 2% of the economy in 2004; 4 directly support some 5,461 full time equivalent jobs; 4 underpin 9,225 jobs directly and indirectly across Devon and Cornwall; 4 account for 8% of all full time equiva lent jobs in the Pl ymouth travel to work area; 4 spend \u00a337 million a year with 420 local supply firms; 4 pay around 40% more t han the Plymouth average; 4 convert every \u00a31 million of direct local income generated in the dockyard into an additional \u00a3300,000 of income for the two counties through multiplier effects. 4.11 The importance of the Navy to the Pl ymouth area is in fact even greater as there are a further 12 Naval es tablishments thr oughout the area including the FOST operation at HM S Drake. We discuss later the relationship between continuing nava l operations and the operat ion of the Airport. 50 Dockyard Millions Add Up For The Region , Western Morning News, 7th July 2005, Page 6-7 Plymouth City Airport Study 34 York Aviation LLP 4.12 We were also told that, historica lly, many of the business s ervices firms within Plymouth have been relian t, either directly or indirectly, upon work for the MoD or associated employers. T he steady decline in this work appears to have prompted companies to reduce their reliance on the MoD, and this, in itself, is generating a confidence that there is 'life afte r' the MoD, giving firms the self-assurance to grow in th eir own right. This sector, however, appears to primarily be expan ding to serve a growing South West market rather than a more global market, wh ich would generate substantial demand for air travel. 4.13 The reduced dependency on the Mo D als o appears to be changing the image of the City, which has long b een viewed by many investors and business people as a 'Dockyard Town'. As a result, many firms are starting to provide business services to ot her sectors and businesses within the wider Region to replace 'lost' MoD business. There is evidence that this is leading to the development of a large number of small, high value, firms but employing only limited number s of people in the local area. This supports the evidence in the 2002 SWRDA report51 in terms of the dependence of the Plymouth economy on small businesses. 4.14 It is also felt that the City's retail o ffering is not as strong as it could or, indeed, should be, relative to the populat ion base in the City. This leads to residents travelling to Exeter, or i ndeed Bristol, for their shopping needs. There is a view that the quality of the reta il offer is a restrictive factor in terms of overall quality of life in the City, adversely affect ing the attraction of new investment and employees. Economic Vision 4.15 The economic vision for the future of Plymouth is of a knowledge-based economy, drawing upon existing skills an d sectors to develop and encourage focused cluster growth. 4.16 The anticipated cluster growth is set out in the City Growth Strategy and consists of the following key sectors: 51 The South West Economic State of the R egion Report, South West Regional Development Agency, 2002 Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 35 4 Advanced Engineering; 4 Business Services; 4 Creative Industries; 4 Marine Industries; 4 Medical and Healthcare; 4 Tourism and Leisure. 4.17 The cluster identification and analysi s work undertaken for the City Growth Strategy would suggest that Medica l and Healthcare, Marine Industries, Advanced Engineering and Tourism sh ould represent the most viable sectors. The report hints at a c hange to tourism within the City, based on the vision of what the City could becom e, however it does not explicitly suggest a move away from the traditi onal tourist market. Tourism is discussed further later in this section. 4.18 There is recognition that a link exists between the ec onomic and physical visions for Plymouth. The vision for physical development is intended to create a city in which peopl e want to live, and theref ore in which companies can locate because it is attractive to their workforce. The vision put forward suggests that the physical changes to the City will make it particularly attractive to graduates and highly qualifi ed employees. The ab ility to attract and retain such employees will al so require improvements to the accessibility of the City to overco me perceptions of peripherality. 4.19 Of the chosen sectors for development, the Medical and Healthcare sector is already starting to develop. Derriford Ho spital was, until recently, the largest non-teaching hospital in the UK, although now it is also a teaching hospital. As well as the role of the Ho spital in driving the growth in this sector, there is a close link with the University which has focused resources into developing a medical research facility. Various specialist firms are developing in the vicinity of the Hospital, leading to the view that there is genuine cluster development in this sector. Plymouth City Airport Study 36 York Aviation LLP4.20 Additionally, there are several de veloping business parks within Plymouth which are focused around knowledge ba sed industries. We discuss developments at Tamar Science Park, in the vicinity of Derriford Hospital, later in this section. 4.21 However, work on the implementation of the Growth Strategy has not yet progressed to the point where it is clear is h ow achievable it will be to attract and retain all of these sectors on any significant scale. The implementation plan for the Strategy is being devel oped by EDAW (in partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers). Initial work on the strategy indicates 5 key themes as essential to achieving the step change in the Plymouth economy, namely: 4 Diversifying the Business Base; 4 Skills and Learning; 4 Infrastructure and Access; 4 Economic Inclusion; 4 Leadership and Governance. 4.22 The focus of the Stra tegy will improve the compet itiveness of the City an d improve its image on the gl obal economic stage. Im proving the performance of the City in high value added activi ties is seen as being of special importance. Whilst the City is seen as having substantial potential strengths based on an effective education sector , marine and medical science bases and quality of life benefit s, poor transport links and peripherality are still perceived as significant weaknesses. Although much of the strategy for Plymouth is focused on endogenous growth, connectivity is seen as important to sustaining linkages with ot her key parts of the UK and Europe. The importance of the Airport is spec ifically cited in this regard. 4.23 A further component is the bi-polar nature of dev elopm ent in Plymouth, with city centre growth complemented by the science cluster in and around Derriford. The location of the Airport is potentially significant in this regard as part of the high tech cluster. As we ll as the importance of the Airport to the image of this area, release of part of the airport site for development potentially adds value. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 37 4.24 It should be noted that the time frame for the achievement of this Vision is 2026. Hence, it is important to consider the role of the Airport not just in terms of Plymouth as it is today but Plymouth as it aspires to be in 20 years time. If the City is successful in rea lising its Vision, it is likely that the existence of a local air port will assume greater si gnificance than it does today. On the other hand, the existence of the Airport, both in terms of the enhancements to accessibility which it actually prov ides and in the perception of accessibility, will be an important component in securing the conditions necessary for the Vision to be delivered. Tourism 4.25 One of the key target s for the City is to enhance t he tourism offer. The historical aspects of the City - the waterfront and Hoe - have been the main selling points to date. However, S outh West Tourism sees little scope for growth in this market segment, potentia lly leaving visitor numbers arriving at Plymouth at a standstill unless new market opportunities can be exploited. 4.26 The opportunity for tourism growth needs to be seen in terms of the 'Mackay Vision' and a new perception of Plym outh. The vision to be a 'European Cultural City' would suggest a changing tourism offer, with more emphasis on the short stay city break market. According to South West Tourism, this type of tourism is the main growth se ctor within the UK, with longer breaks now primarily being taken overseas. Evidence is that visitors are increasingly enticed to cities such as Leeds, Newcastle and Bilbao on the basis of the quality of the entertainm ent, food and cultural offerings. The development of the waterfront is seen in the 'Mackay Vi sion' as key to penetrating this market. 4.27 However, the Plymouth City tourism strategy is less clear on priorities for the future, with no dec ision having been made as yet on whether the City intends to follow the traditional path, or embrace the new brand of tourism. The short city break market offers two distinct benefits which could potentially enhance the City economy. Firs tly, visitors have a higher spend per night than traditional tourist visi tors, some of whom may not even be staying in the City. Secondly, the market is less seasonal with the potential for a strong development of t he out-of-season market. Plymouth City Airport Study 38 York Aviation LLP4.28 Development of a clear tourism stra tegy, and all that it entails, has the potential to shape the City's overall qu ality of life offer. The quality of facilities required to attract short break visitors are also the same as those required for a city looking to develop as a vibrant, high quality place to live and work. Consequently the vision of the City could be made more sustainable through taking steps to encouraging this type of tourism, although it is not clear which would come first. 4.29 The difficulty with achieving this is that the City would have to compete with a number of other cities, not just in t he UK but also in Europe. This short break market is particularly driv en by younger age categories and the decision making process tends to be based on a mental list of cities driven by cultural and city reviews in the press. 4.30 The experience of the t ourism authority is that the actual decis ion making process for taking a break in a city is short and is driven by three factors: 4 Where can I fly to from my local airport? 4 How cheaply can I get there? 4 How long will it take to get there? Each of these involves the question of accessibility. 4.31 Given the relative inaccessibility of Plymouth by surface transport, a decision to embrace the short break market would increase the importance of air transport in supporting tourism development. 4.32 Other key stakeholders have suggested that there is also a growing touris m market related to the sea and, in particu lar, scuba diving activities. The view held is that there is scope for development of these niche tourism offers, but that these, too, will need to compete with a number of other destinations on the basis of ease of access as well as other factors. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 39 Stakeholder Consultations 4.33 A list of the organisati ons and individuals that we have already consulted with is contained within Appendix A of this Report. Chamber of Commerce 4.34 The Chamber of Commerce (CoC) is ve ry supportive of the economic vision for Plymouth. It perceives that investors now view Plymouth with increased confidence with less dependence on t he dockyard than historically. 4.35 A key issue for the Chamber of Commerce has been the perceived peripherality of Plymouth and the surrounding area and t he implications this could have upon the ability of the City to achieve its intended growth. Of particular concern is the quality of the road network to the far South West. The CoC are keen to highl ight that the lack of a motorway as far as Plymouth appears to be a major impedi ment to securing investment, whereas Exeter has been more successful because of the existence of a \"blue line on the road maps\". 4.36 Nevertheless, the motorway, as fa r as Exeter, connecting to the A38 Expressway, is regarded as a highly impor tant link to Plymout h, but one that is susceptible to accidents, with fr equent road closures pushing traffic onto smaller A-road alternatives, the A 303 and A358. Al though there are improvements planned to the A358, the A303 sti ll remains subject to problems and this will continue to contribute to a per ception of unreliability in terms of the strategic r oad network to Plymouth. 4.37 Additionally, the CoC considers the ra il net work to be vulnerable to weather conditions, particularly in the winter months, which tends to reinforce perceptions of unreliable surface access. Scope for improvements to surface access is limited for the foreseea ble future. Hence, air travel is viewed as the only credible means of providing suitable alternatives and increasing transport reliability to the area in the short to medium term. This is particularly significant for domestic travel. Plymouth City Airport Study 40 York Aviation LLP 4.38 The CoC feels that the London air link remains essential to the continued successful regeneration of Ply mouth, as borne out by earlier studies by KPMG52 and ERM53. Ideally, the CoC would like this link to be moved to London Heathrow to improv e international connection s and provide a better surface link from Plymouth to the centre of London. However, it is accepted that this is unlikely to happen, at le ast until a third Heathrow runway is opened (which is not yet guaranteed). The view is that the current route network from Plymouth City Airport must at least be retained as it appears to be central to the sustaining the growth strategy. However, the use of London Gatwick as a hub from Plymout h causes some concerns, and consequently some travellers are still driving to London He athrow to take flights that are not availa ble from Gatwick. In order for Plymouth to be a 'City of the World', it is c onsidered that Plymouth needs high quality world connections through a hub, and Amsterdam and Paris are seen as sensible options. Services to Paris have recently commenced from Exeter. 4.39 The use of Exeter Airport is viewed as a realistic alternative where services are available but there is a doubt t hat a London service would be sustained from that airport because of the shorter surface journey time. Also, Exeter is less attractive for shorter journeys as t he time taken to reach it offsets the time advantage of air for most UK domestic journeys. We will explore the costs and benefits of Plymout h City Airport compared to Exeter Airport later in this report. 4.40 If services to London were to be lost, th is could hav e a devastating effect on some Chamber businesses. Significantly, it is fe lt that there would be substantial damage to Plymouth's image as a place to do business. An example cited was a member of the Chamber which does a lot of business with a client in Preston, Lancashire. Without the air link to Manchester, allowing fast travel for m eetings, then the client could choose not to continue trading with the company because of the time and cost implications involved with journeys by other modes. 52 Plymouth Airport Economic Impact Assessment - Final Report, September 1997 53ERM report on the Economic Impact of Plymouth City Airport for SWRDA Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 41 4.41 The CoC was keen to point out that there is a market distinction between Plymouth and Exeter Airpor ts, and that this could be important in securing a long term future for Plymouth City Airpor t. It was consi dered that Plymouth City Airport could continue to meet local business needs operating a fleet of the next generation turboprops and r egional jets, without the need for services to a very wide array of destinations across Europe. Exeter could then develop to provide a wider range of leisure oriented services. 4.42 Closure of the Airport would be viewed as a huge impediment to business, because of \"time and ease of travel\" issues. However, the CoC does not feel that many companies would have to relocate in their entirety in the event because of the reliance on serving the local market for many companies. The companies most likely to be affect ed by any restriction at the Airport would be the remaining Japanese companies because the senior management fly into and out of the area. Without convenient air links they would be unable to make their necessary visits. 4.43 The CoC acknowledges t hat getting people into and ou t of the sub-region is key to securing international investm ent, but may not be as much of a hindrance to allowing local firms to grow, particularly with the arrival of broadband internet access. Al ongside the problem of peripherality, there are additional issues which could impede the Ci ty growing; firstly, the retail offer may not be sufficient to serve the needs of the expanding City and to attract new employees and visitors, and, secondl y, that there have been planning issues have arisen in the past whic h have restricted development and been a barrier to inward investment. It is acknowledged that the planning system has improved and that the new retail c entre in the City may provide a base for an increased retail offer to turn the City in the shopping capital for the sub-region. Devon and Cornwall Business Council 4.44 Like the Chamber of Commerce, t he Devon and Cornwall Bus iness Council (DCBC) is supportive of the Vision for Plymouth and the plan for economic development. As the name suggests, the remit of the DCBC covers the entirety of the far South West, and s ubsequently the strategic views made regarding transport reflect this. Plymouth City Airport Study 42 York Aviation LLP4.45 The DCBC emphasises that even now there are changes to the way firms are conducting their business and that t here is growth and transformation of many of the existing firms in the area. This is highlighted by the fact that development of high quality business premises has grown substantially. According to the DCBC, developers are not building speculatively, because they have been \"stung\" in the past by previous \"false dawns\" for Plymouth. Consequently, the fact that development in Plymouth is taking place shows that there is an underlying demand for premis es and confidence in the market. The source of this demand t ends to be local, ei ther from long established firms, sole traders increasing their scale, or from embryonic firms just starting out. 4.46 Broadband internet access has been highlighted as a major driver of this growth for a number of reasons. Firstly, this has allowed existing firms to deal better with c ustomers and clients ou tside of the sub-region, allowing them to increase their customer base. Secondly, it has allowed staff to relocate from major offices in the larger cities to home working facilities, with the choice of location based on the quality of life. As a consequence, employees of some large firms are mo ving into the far South West from London and the South East and continuing to do their jobs from home. Thirdly, broadband internet has encour aged a level of entrepreneurship because it has taken away a level of ri sk as businesses can initially be run from home and the market for services can be far wider than the far South West. 4.47 However, DCBC is keen to highlight that the use of br oadband is actually increasing the need to travel outside of the sub-region, primarily because the spread of locations in which businesse s are trading is growing, and many firms still need to meet their clients. In addition, those moving to work from home in the area need to travel to their employers' offices and to see existing clients. Impor tantly broadband is permitting a 'step-change' towards trading internationally because contac t with clients can be constantly maintained regardless of t he distance between the two. 4.48 The DCBC highlights t hat manufacturing is a g ood example of a sector which is c hanging. Within the South West Region as a whole, it suggests that manufacturing accounts for 20% of the base employment. Contrary to expectations though this is not declining, it is simply changing in nature. The move is away from traditional heavy engineering towards light engineering and manufacturing, with goods of increasing value. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 43 4.49 The decline in MoD activity in Plymouth has chang ed the supply chain according to the DCBC, and this is lead ing to local firms looking elsewhere for their business in order to grow . This has been aided by a stable economy and the fact that companies have been able to survive without the MoD has instilled a level of confidence in businesses in Plymouth overall. 4.50 The DCBC feels that inward invest ment i n the Plymouth sub-region has slowed in recent years, and that trying to attract new firms using incentives may not always make economic sense as some firms will choose to move again if costs rise. Instead, it is suggested that existing firms should be encouraged to develop by outward expa nsion. However, DCBC is not against inward investment, rather it sees other options being available to drive the desired growth. 4.51 It was highlighted that the number of company regi strations within the sub- region is increasing and, although the number of liqu idations is also increasing, the percentage of new businesses failing is not growing proportionally. This suggests that there is a growing level of entrepreneurship, which is a key aim of all the economic pol icies related to the area. 4.52 Like all other consultees, the DCBC feels transport is a major issue. The grouping has selected Exeter Airport as their main focus of support for air transport provision, but is keen to stre ss this is not to the detriment of Plymouth City Airport or Newquay Air port, which both have roles within the sub-region. Once again, the view was that businesses perceive air travel as the most reliable mode, and rail takes second place, typically only selected by many firms when there is no flight to their destination. 4.53 The choice of Exeter was based on several factors: 4 the weather conditions at Exeter are extremely good and consequently there are fewer delays, thereby improving the perception of reliability; 4 businesses in the South West are particularly focusing on environmental issues and Exeter Ai rport offers the best solution because aircraft fly out over less populated areas, thereby reducing the impact on local communities; Plymouth City Airport Study 44 York Aviation LLP4 the infrastructure at Exeter Airport can support a wider array of services with very few limitations likel y on the types of routes needed. 4.54 The view of the DCBC is that Newquay Airport's recent success has highlighted an underlying demand for tr avel to and from the sub-region, which even businesses were not formerl y aware of. The group feels that if there were no airport at Plymouth, this would impact on Plymouth based businesses less than on Cornish businesses. DCBC believes that, whilst the drive to Bristol Airport is too far and prone to delays, the drive to Exeter Airport is acceptable. Newquay Airport is acceptable for much of Cornwall, although Plymouth is more convenient for much of the east of the County. 4.55 The DCBC has questioned whether Plymouth City Airport has been marketed sufficiently as many Cornish bus inesses are not using the facility, primarily because they are not aware of it, and the marketing does not give the perception that the Airport is also a potential gateway to eastern and (some parts of) northern Cornwall. South West Tourism 4.56 We have largely covered the views of South West Tourism earlier in this section. It should be noted that a further impediment to growth of the local tourism industry is the lack of sufficient 'bed stock', and those beds currently available are primarily taken up by business travellers. Despite this, Plymouth has displayed an ability to hol d major events, such as the National Fireworks Display, suggesting that Plymout h could be marketed as a centre for national or regional events. 4.57 The peripherality of the sub-region acts as a major barrier though to the ability of Plymouth to develop as a city break destination. The issue of long travel times restricts the possibility for visitors to travel by car, and from many parts of the UK by train. It is al so the view of Sout h West Tourism that congested roads in the Midlands and Sout h East provide a physical barrier, with potential visitors unlikely to want to use these routes to access a high quality city break. Journey times and co ngestion are even more likely to act as a deterrent to leisure tourism than business visits. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 45 4.58 In the view of South West Tourism, Newquay and Exeter Airports are located too far from Plymouth to pr ovide the necessary air access for a city break. Travellers want to travel directly to their destination, wit h convenient public transport at the destination end. 4.59 It is considered that Plymouth City and Newquay Airports serve different markets, with Ne wquay serving the wider Cornwall market for longer stay travellers, whereas Plymouth could offer the type of airport needed to support short city break tourism. It is this market which is critical to increasing the added value of tourism to the area. Tamar Science Park 4.60 Tamar Science Park is located adjacent to Derriford Hospital to the north of Plymouth. The facilit y is a dedicated scien ce park, with strict criteria for the type of tenant allowed on site. Essentia lly, the site is only available to added-value, knowledge-based businesses. Currently, it is the only official Science Park in the South West of England, alth ough the Regional Development Agency has just agreed to pur chase land for a similar facility at Bristol. 4.61 Uptake of units has led to a current total of 57 companies with a total of around 650 employees on site. The Scienc e Park points out that the types of firms on site are mir roring the sector s identified by the Regional Economic Strategy and City Growth Strategy, althoug h the majority of firms are related to the Healthcare and Medicine sectors. 4.62 The experience of the Science Park is that the majority of companies, around 80%, moving onto the site are do ing so from within the local area, highlighting once again that current economic growth seems to be from within, more than through inward invest ment. Much of the success of the site is linked to the developments taking place at Derriford Hospital. Plymouth City Airport Study 46 York Aviation LLP 4.63 The Science Park believes that the abilit y to travel is of crucial importance to the develo pment of the facility and al so the City. However, should the Airport close, it would not initially impact on many of their tenants because they have always been based in t he area. One exception may be a Norwegian surveying firm, which has a direct requirement for an airport near its offices because it is involved in coastal surveys. 4.64 The Science Park feels that the current air offer must be retained, and that services to Manchester and Leeds, in par ticular, are highly valuable becaus e they bring the North of England within easy reach. It is less clear, however, that development of services from the Airport is crucial to the success of the Park. Nonetheless, the Airport is c onsidered as a marketing tool for the facility, and this will increase as the site continues to develop. The Science Park highlighted one Swiss firm that was extremely keen on moving some facilities into the area and, whilst t hey were more than happy with all the elements of the City, it was considered that the difficulty in getting executives in for occasional visits was a material impediment to them locating there. 4.65 Future stages of development are antic ipated to include larger units, aimed at being headquarters buildings, which wo uld require a step change in the type of company located there. An extension to the Science Park has recently been announced, including faciliti es to attract more businesses in the knowledge based and medica l sectors. Such companies tend to have a higher reliance on air travel and hence pr oximity to a thriving airport will be critical. New business units are expected to be complete by 2008.54 Derriford Hospital 4.66 Derriford is Cornwall and West Devo n's largest hospital and offers a full range of services. In recent years it has introduced teaching at its medical school and also undert akes extensive research studies. 54 SWRDA Web-site, 2.2.06 Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 47 4.67 The close proximity to the Tamar Science Park has enabled close links to develop between the Hospital and specia list medical research companies that in turn enable Derriford to attract and retain high quality consultants, doctors and staff. Overall, the Hospital is viewed as a key driver to the location decision and success of many companies based at the Science Park. The Derriford Campus Group, l ead by the hospital, includes Tamar Science Park, The Plymouth University Medical School and Plymouth City Airport. This group aims to develop and capitalise on synergies between them and to seek to share facilitie s and services where appropriate. 4.68 The provision of scheduled air services is seen as key to Derriford Hospital being able to retain its current posit ion and support cont inued growth in medical research. The services to London and to Leeds ar e of particular importance as the Department of Health has major offices in these cities. Speedy linkages are vital for the effici ent running of Derriford as it enables either full day working at either end of these routes and/or day returns to be possible. The London service is also used for connecting flights to either Europe or the USA in connection wit h health conferences and medical research. Additionally, there are occa sional fixed wing charter and air taxi flights that operate at Pl ymouth bringing in dignitaries and VIPs associated with activities at the Hospital and the various medical research companies in the science park. 4.69 Whilst Derriford Hospital has its own helipad, where emergency cases can be flown in directly by helicopter, it also relies signific antly on Plymouth City Airport to provide life line facilities for the City and sub-region. These include both civilian and military air ambul ance and air sea rescue operations. There are also 'transpl ant' flights that fly 'o rgans' in and out and also occasionally flights bringing in spec ialist 'medical teams' associated with some operations. Most of this flying activity is by helicopter, which provides both speed of response, directness and flex ibility in being able to reach all parts of the sub-region wit hout the need for a convent ional runway strip. Often, the size of the helicopter is too great for the Hospital's own 'pad' or weather conditions prevent it from bei ng available for safety reasons and so Plymouth City Airport is used instead. Night ti me operations are often directed to Plymouth City Airport as t hese are not always feasible at the hospital 'pad' for safety reasons. T he Airport is theref ore essential to continuation of the Hospital's role in emergency operations serving the more remote parts of the sub-region. Plymouth City Airport Study 48 York Aviation LLPMinistry of Defence/FOST 4.70 The Flag Officer Sea Training (FOS T) operation at HM S Drake is of particular significance in connection wit h Plymouth City Airport as helicopter operations supporting the FOST activity take place from the Airport. FOST is responsible for providing all of the 'operational' and 'continuation' sea training for the Royal Navy. It also undertakes similar training for other navies. It employs more than 400 pers onnel, mainly trai ners and examiners across the full naval spectrum of disciplines and skills. Activity is split between Glasgow and Plymouth with aro und 2/3 of the workforce and the HQ being at Plymouth. T hese coordinated exercise s can also include the other arms of the forces, the RAF and Army, and sometimes multinational exercises such as those involving NATO. 4.71 FOST now also undertakes 3rd party training as a commercial venture for other overseas navies and sees this as a way of increasing their operations of this type, providing a str eam of income for the region. 4.72 In all cases, this training takes place out at sea. The ships involv ed may be at sea for days or even weeks during t hese training exercises, during which it is necessary to transport FOST training and examination personnel, as well as associated paperwork, betw een HMS Drake, the FOST base in Plymouth, and the ship. Most of this transport is done by sea, however a significant proportion of it mu st be done by helicopter. 4.73 FOST has periodically considered pr oviding its own helipad and helicopters based at the either the Naval Bas e in Pl ymouth at Weston Mill or at near by HMS Drake. However, each time this has been rejected on grounds of cost of provision and operation, and practicalities - in particular there is not enough available land clear of buildings and obstacles to enable the provision of an all-weather year round helicopter la nding area as well as other safety issues. Hence, FOST continues to rely on the use of Plymouth City Airport. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 49 4.74 To use an alternative airport such as Newquay or Exeter has also been rejected as both are too far away from the FOST base at HMS Drake for efficiency of a seamless operation. Ther e are no other airfields, military or civilian, available in the sub-region that would suit the FOST operation. In order for FOST to continue providin g an air service component of its operation then the availability of Plymouth City Airport is seen as vital. If these helicopter transfer flights between Plymouth and the ships at sea could not take place then FOST would be faced with a number of choices. These include having to provide significantly more personnel and boats to ensure that the speed of training exercises can be maintained, or to take longer to complete each session of training activi ty (which would in turn raise costs to the ship operations as they would be ti ed up in training activity for longer), or to scale back the range and nature of training activity altogether. 4.75 None of these alternatives is desirabl e to FOST, or to t he well being of the naval related activities in Plymouth. An in ability to offer air transport as part of the 'package' will likely result in a r eduction of training activity centred on Plymouth and with it the size of FOST. It may also result in the loss of prestigious multinational exercises bei ng centred on Plymouth, such as NATO activities, and with it a loss of jobs and inco me to the City and sub- region. It may also result in the loss of some of the 3 rd party training for other navies. Plymouth Cit y Airport is, then, vital for the FOST operation. 4.76 Also based at Plymouth City Air port is 727 Squadron, which has 4 Grob training aircraft used to test the apt itude of all potent ial Royal Navy and Royal Marines' pilots. These prospective student pilots undergo a rigorous training programme over a two week period using these Grob aircraft. If they pass this training then they progress to more advanced training with larger aircraft types elsewhere in the UK. Plymouth City Airport is the only place that this type of training takes place. These training flights take place most weekdays throughout the year, weather permitting. 4.77 Other military related flying at Plymouth includes other helicopter and fixed wing flights that bring in military dign itaries, personnel, VIPs, admirals, etc, for the Royal Navy, RAF, British Army , the Queens' Flight and for overseas military forces and governments. The ab ility to fly directly to Plymouth is important given the convenience to the close proximity to Devonport Dockyard, the Naval Base and the other naval establishments in the Plymouth region. Plymouth City Airport Study 50 York Aviation LLP4.78 The military forces would like to use Plymouth City Airport for the transport of troops. However, the current runway is a little too short for aircraft such as the Hercules. The proposed runway exte nsion would help in this respect. Whilst helicopter operations are restrict ed at weekends and this poses some restrictions on military activity, most requirements will usually fall on a weekday. Weekend restrictions are, hence, not critical. 4.79 Finally, military personnel also make use of the scheduled air services available at Plymouth City Airport, in particula r the link to London. Destinations such as Edinburgh and Glasgow would be welcome as these would provide a direct link between acti vities such as FOST at Glasgow and the Royal Navy on the east coast of Scotland. 4.80 Overall, then, Plymouth City Airport plays an important role in the continuing naval presence in Plymouth, without whic h there may be further diminution in naval activity. We discuss the noise implications of naval related flying activity in Section 8 . University 4.81 The new University of Plymouth has link ages wit h the Marine Biological Association, Plymouth Marine Laborator y, St. Alistair Harvey Foundation, National Marine Aquarium and a number of private marine activities. They are working to bring all these activi ties on to a single SWRDA site at Millbury, Plymouth, in a \u00a330-40 million scheme. The st rategy is to position Plymouth as a centre of excellence in a ll things related to study and research within the marine industry. 4.82 The University also has strong link ages with the creative industries, and has also worked clos ely with the MoD and Navy. One of its biggest challenges is to assist Plymouth City Council and ot her local and regional agencies in improving the retention of graduates in the local la bour force. Currently, success is quite patchy and is espec ially a problem within the creative industries. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 51 4.83 Part of the issue is q uality of life and the associated availability of services including leisure activity; part is al so connectivity and here Plymouth City Airport has a role to play. Already , University lecturers and researchers make good use of air links to Lo ndon, Leeds and Manchester and through connections at London to Europe. Retention of these linkages is seen as vital as it not only enab les Plymouth-based personnel to reach other parts of the UK and Europe but enables personnel from t hese regions to reach Plymouth easily. Any improvements to t hese air services will be welcome. Not only for personnel but also for students as it will contribut e to helping the retention initiatives. Economic Structure and the Need for Air Services 4.84 It is within this context that the role of the Airport and air services in supporting economic growth needs to be seen. The primary sectors that benefit from air services in the UK fall into two overlapping groups: 4 sectors that account for a signifi cant proportion of the business demand for passenger and freight traffic in the UK and hence are the key drivers of business-related demand for air services ; 4 sectors for which passenger and freight transport account for a significant proportion of their purc hases of goods and services and hence for which investment and locati on decisions are likely to be most sensitive to the availabi lity of business-related air services. These are sometimes referred to as air intensive sectors. 4.85 Two pieces of research have thrown light on to the defin ition of these two groups. The MDS Transmodal Study of UK air freight analysed the purchases of air transport services by sector based on the 1996 input-output tables. The results are shown in Table 4.2. This table shows that the ten sectors accounted for nearly two-thir ds (64.9%) of the demand for air transport, with financial and business services accounting for nearly one- third (32.2%) of demand. Plymouth City Airport Study 52 York Aviation LLPTable 4.2: Sector Breakdown of the Purchases of Air Transport in the UK Sector % of air transport purchases Banking and Finance 15.7% Air Transport 11.9% Insurance and Pension Funds 11.2% Other Business Services 5.3% Transport Services 5.2% Postal Services 4.5% Wholesale Distribution 3.6% Recreational Services 3.0% Printing and Publishing 2.3% Motor Vehicle Distribution and Repair 2.2% Total Transmodal relation to 'air intensive' sector s, a report by Oxford Economic Forecasting for the UK Government55 analysed the proportion of the total transport inputs of economic sectors that is accounted for by aviation (including both air freight and passenger travel) and their ex penditure on air transport services per employee. 4.87 The results are shown in Table 4.3 for those sectors in which either the proportion spent on aviation is greater than 20% or the expenditure per employee was greater than \u00a3500 in 1996 (defined as 'air intensive' sectors). 4.88 Table 4.3 shows that t here are 13 'air intensive' s ectors in the UK (on the definition adopted), of which four ar e in manufacturing and seven are in services. Five of the 'air intensive' sectors were also identified in Table 4.2 as 'key drivers of demand' (banking and finance, insur ance and pension funds, other business services, transport services, and printing and publishing). This does not mean t hat other sectors will not be locally significant in generating demand for particular servic es, but they are unlikely to be sufficient to generate the dem and for a wide range of routes operated at a high frequency of service. 55 The Contribution of the Aviation Industry to the UK Economy, Oxford Economic Forecasting Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 53 Table 4.3: 'Air Intensive' Economic Sectors in the UK Share of air transport in total transport demand Expenditure on air transport per employee Economic Sectors Rank % Rank \u00a3 in 1996 Extraction 13 13% 2 \u00a31,152 Basic Metals 14 13% 7 \u00a3537 Coke, Petroleum and Nuclear Fuel 9 23% 3 \u00a31,044 Other Means of Transport 1 64% 6 \u00a3565 Printing and Publishing 4 35% 9 \u00a3454 Precision and Optical Instruments 10 20% 16 \u00a3140 Transport 11 19% 5 \u00a3796 Communication 8 23% 8 \u00a3478 Insurance 3 36% 1 \u00a31,528 Banking and Finance 2 50% 4 \u00a3970 Computer Activities 6 24% 17 \u00a3114 Research and Development 7 24% 25 \u00a366 Other Business Services 5 30% 15 \u00a3183 Note: the rankings are out of 35 economic sectors. Source: Oxford Economic Forecasting56 4.89 What is noticeable is t he extent to which there is a similarity bet ween these sectors and the key growth sectors identified in the economic growth strategies for Plymouth and the wider South-West. A key feature of the UK economy in recent decades has been its changing structure. As the UK economy has matured it has become increasingly based upon knowledge- driven sectors, such as banking and finance and other business services. While this change has be en driven by London it has been reflected throughout the UK regions. 4.90 Sectors such as financial and bus ines s services, creative industries, advanced engineering and manufacturing, environmental and healthcare technologies, and ICT currently do and wi ll increasingly operate in a global market. If they are to fulfil their gr owth potential and s upport the prosperity of the sub-region, thes e sectors will need the support of a strong air transport infrastructure. 56 Ibid Table E.2 page 74 and Table E.3 page 75. Plymouth City Airport Study 54 York Aviation LLPConclusion 4.91 It is clear that the vision for the City of Plymouth is seeking a 'step change' in economic performance. It is against th is context, rather than the economy today, that the significance of the Airport needs to be viewed. 4.92 There is reported high dependence of loc al businesse s on the link to London Gatwick, but the full potent ial of the Airport has not yet been exploited. Hence, the wider business community in North East Cornwall and South Devon focus more on Newquay and Exeter Airports respectively. 4.93 Given the tendency of grow th in the economy over re cent years to be drive n by indigenous growth, there is little clear evidence that the Airport is presently acting as a driver of economic growth overall, but plays more of a supporting role in the development of the economy for those firms undertaking some level of tr ading outside of the region. 4.94 The critical issues are the extent to which exp ansion of services at the Airport could act as a driver of future economic growth and the impact that constraint on, or even closure of, the Airport could have on the city region being able to realise the require d 'step change' in performance. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 55 5 DEFINING THE MARKET Key Points 4 Previous forecasts for Plymouth City Airport prepared before the Future of Air Transport White Paper indicated that the Airport could be handling up to 200,000 passengers by 2015 and 300,000 by 2030. 4 More recently, Air Southwest has shown that the Airport is capable of sustaining much more rapid growth through the introduction of regional low fare services, although following suspension of services by Air Wales, the Airport handled 109,000 passengers in 2005, some 52% more than in 2003. 4 In considering the future market for Plymouth City Airport, under any scenario where the Airport remains restricted to th e current runway length, services will be limited to destinations within the UK and some closer points in continental Europe within the range of the current aircraft types. 4 An extended runway is required to allow operations by the more modern turbo-prop and regional jet aircraft. As the existing aircraft using Plymouth cease production, handling these newer types will be fundament al to continuing operations as well as allowing a wider range of destinations to be served. 4 Sutton Harbour Holdings has put forward two development options to achieve a greater runway length necessary to secure the future for the Airport; the shorter option would use the RESAs at each end as starter extensions to provide a take-off distance of 1,319m but with restrictions on the landing distance available, the longer option would provide a runway length of 1,319m would be provided for both landings and take-offs, with the required RESAs at both ends. 4 4 ill only be achievable with the success of the Plymouth City Growth Strategy. 4 ion of a runway extension, with necessary RESAs, is essential to securing growth. Although we present forecasts for a scenario where the Airport is limited to its existing runway length and the required RESAs are not provided, we consider that there are high risks that this projected throughput would not be achieved as the Airport would be highly unattractive to airlines and limited to older aircraft types. We have produced low, medium and high projections of demand at Plymouth City Airpor t assuming either a short runway extension or a long runway extension. Higher levels of growth w Our analysis would suggest that the Airport could be handling up to 1 million passe ngers by 2030, dependent on the length of runway provided and the success in attracting airlines to operate new services. We consider that provisPlymouth City Airport Study 56 York Aviation LLP South West of England Airports 5.1 In this section, we examine the per formance of passenger services from the far South West, and look at the potential for Plymouth City Airport to attract additional services both with and without an extension to the runway. The assessment has been undertaken by having regard to the other airports in the region at Newquay, Ex eter and Bristol. In our core scenarios, we have assumed that all airports continue in operation in parallel and without restriction in terms of being able to attract new services to meet local demand. 5.2 Plymouth City Airport is one of three airports serving the far South West of England, along with Exeter Airport and Ne wquay Airport. The airports are in relatively closely located hence the core catchment area for Plymouth City Airport does overlap to an extent thos e of Exeter and Newquay. The core catchment areas of the thr ee airports are shown in Figure 5.1 . 5.3 Given the proximity of the three airports, it is neces sary to consider the implications of development at Plymouth City Airport on the other two and vice versa. 5.4 We are aware that passenger forecasts for Plymouth City Airport were prepared as part of the various exerci s es undertaken in the lead up to the Future of Air Transport White Paper. The most recent forecasts were undertaken by Aviasolutions and can be found in the document Development of an Air Transport Stra tegy for the Far South West of England57. 57 Development of an Air Transport Strategy for th e Far South West of England, Avia Solutions, June 2003 Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 57 Figure 5.1: 1 Hour Drive Time Ca tchment Areas for Plymouth, Exeter and Newquay Airports Source: Microsoft Multimap 5.5 Both the forecasts used by the DfT in their consultation documents and those by Aviasolutions showed a maximum throughput of 300,000 passengers per annum at Plymouth by 20 30. By 2015, the DfT forecasts indicated that the Airport would be handling 200,000 passengers and the Aviasolutions report suggested 188,000 passengers. In both cases, the forecasts were based exclusively on services by traditional full service carriers. The Aviasolu tions report suggested: \"Low Frills Carriers are not expected to operate at Plymouth. The runway is not long enough to support the typical aircraft equipment that are employed - B737 and A320 series aircraft or the Dash 8 Q400 used by FlyBE.\" 58 58 Ibid, section 4.10 Plymouth City Airport Study 58 York Aviation LLP5.6 As we go on to explain below, we hav e updated these forecasts in the light of the recent very rapid growth in passenger traffic using the Airport, unforeseen at the time thes e forecasts were prepared. 5.7 The need to establish the particular role of Plymouth Cit y Airport in the market is given added resonanc e by the current uncertainty regarding the future ownership of Exeter Airport as the preferred strategic partner selected by Devon County Council has withdrawn following co mpetition concerns. The Airport is now being marketed again as the Council seeks an alternative strategic investor. 5.8 There is also uncertainty regarding the future of Newquay Air port as the MoD plans to 'mothball' RAF St. Mawgan from 2007. We are aware that Cornwall County Council is presently developing the business case to secure the necessary investment to conver t the airfield to a civilian facility on a permanent basis. Exeter Airport 5.9 Exeter Airport is located to the north east of the city of Exeter, approximately 1 hours drive from Plymout h. Currently the Air port is owned by Devon County Council, although the process of finding a strategic investor is ongoing. 5.10 In 2005, Exeter Airport handled 842,000 passengers, a 37% increase on 2004, whic h in turn repres ented a 57% increase on 2003. Exeter Airport is the most easterly of those located in the far South West, and consequently does not have direct air links with London. The Airport is the main base of Flybe, formerly British European, whic h is continuing to expand services from Exeter. 5.11 Over the last year, the Airport ha s gained a number of new routes ; the main reason for this has been Flybe's r enewed commitment to Exeter. In Table 5.1, we illustrate the scheduled destinations served fr om Exeter Airport in summer 2005. The Airport also serv es a number of charter markets. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 59 Table 5.1: Exeter Airport Scheduled Destinations 2005 Alicante Geneva Malaga Belfast Murcia Brest Guernsey Newcastle Chambery of Palma Edinburgh Leeds/Bradford Toronto Faro Liverpool Source: OAG 5.12 The destinations served from Exeter represent a mix of leisure and business oriented destinations and, not ably, the Airport has a direct link to a European hub, at Paris (Charles de Gaulle). De stinations are served across Europe, partly as a result of the Airport having a longer runway t han that at Plymouth City Airport. 5.13 Exeter Airport has a main runway with a length of 2,083 metres, and therefore has the ability to offer a mu ch wider range of services than could be offered from Plymouth (even with a runway extension). This runway would allow the Airport to be used by fu ll low fare carriers such as Ryanair and easyJet, although neither currently oper ates. In addition, some long haul leisure flights have operated from Exeter, albeit that many of these require an intermediate refuelling stop. 5.14 The White Paper sugges ts that Exeter Airport might grow to around 2-2.5 million pas sengers per annum by 2030. No restrictions were placed on that development from a nat ional perspective, and matters were left to be determined locally. Plymouth City Airport Study 60 York Aviation LLPNewquay Airport 5.15 Newquay Airport is loca ted 4 miles south west of Newq uay. The Airport is the most westerly of the airports in t he region. The airfield is owned by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) having be en a fighter aircraft base, although currently military operations are bei ng wound up, leaving a level of uncertainty over the future of the facility. The MoD had been considering three options for the future of the base: 4 close the facility completely, prevent ing all flying and thereby closing the civil airport; 4 re-open the facility and make it a base for their new Joint Combat Aircraft (JCA), simultaneously leading to restrictions on civilian aircraft movements; 4 permit the civil airport to continue to operate, even with no RAF aircraft based at the facility but with the costs being covered by the civil operation. 5.16 However, it was recently announced t hat the facility would n ot be a base for the JCA aircraft, which would have been a major impediment to scheduled passenger services. Currently, Cornwall County Council is exploring how to finance the considerable investment needed at the site to bring the facility in line with civilian airport standards. The decision not to locate a JCA base at the Airport allows the County Council to plan for the future with greater certainty provided funding can be secured. There may need to be a short period of closure to allow the necessary upgrading work to take place when the aerodrome transfers from military to civil operating standards. 5.17 In 2005, the Airport handled 337,000 passengers, with many of these being on the important London rout es (Air Southwest to London Gatwick and Ryanair to London Stansted). This repr esented growth of 33% over 2004. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 61 5.18 In addition to Ryanair and Air Southwest, there are also services by bmibaby and Skybus (of the Isles of Scilly). The Airport has recently received a further boost to services with the announc ement that Monarch Airlines would commence scheduled services. Table 5.2 shows the current destinations which are served on a scheduled basis out of Newquay. However, Ryanair has recently reduced services to t he Airport and culled plans to provide European connections in part as a result of a recent passenger tax imposed to fund future development, although other new services have been announced for summer 2006. Table 5.2: Newquay Airport Scheduled Destinations 2005 Birmingham Leeds* Bristol London Gat wick Dublin London Stan sted Durham Tees Valley Manchester* * Via Bristol Source: Newquay Airport Website 5.19 The Airport benefits from a much longer runway th an both Exeter and Plymouth at 2,745 metres. Like Exeter, this would allow t he full range of low cost and charter carriers to provide services to any point in Europe. Theoretically, the Airport could also s upport non-stop long haul services to many points, although there is unlikely to be sufficient demand to justify this even in the longer term. 5.20 Within the Future of Air Transport White Paper, it was suggested that the future development of the Airport should be determined locally. We understand that the current Business Pl an for the Airport is considering growth up to 1.8 million passengers by 2030. Plymouth City Airport Study 62 York Aviation LLPPlymouth City Airport Recent History 5.21 Passenger services from Plymouth City Airport in the 1980s and early 1990s consisted of a small selection of desti nations and reflect ed the peripherality of the City, with the pr incipal route being to London Heathrow. These services were provided by Brymon Airw ays, who also oper ated the Airport for a period of time. 5.22 Brymon Airways was bought by British Airways in 199 3 which, at the same time, took over responsibility for operat ing the Airport. In 2001, the airline was merged with other British Airways' r egional subsidiaries to form British Airways CitiExpress, which continued to operate scheduled services from Plymouth. In 1997, the London servic e was transferred to Gatwick. 5.23 Between 1993 and 2003, British Airways, through Bry mon, served a number of destinations with varying success and for varying lengths of time, these included Cork, Edinburgh, Jersey, Bristol and Paris (Charles de Gaulle) and Guernsey. 5.24 In autumn 2003, British Airways CitiE xpress suspended all ser vices from Plymouth, although preparat ions had already been made for a new airline to start operations from Plymouth once BA withdrew. The new airline, Air Southwest, is under the ownership of Su tton Harbour Holdings Plc, although operates as a separate entity to Plymout h City Airport. The airline benefited from a handover of slots at London Gatwick by BA, allowing a seamless transfer of operations between the two. 5.25 In addition to the replacement of the London service, the Airport was successful in attracti ng Air Wales, which took over the Plymouth-Cork service from BA and subs equently added other destinations served via Cardiff. More recently Air Wales has ceased operations at Plymouth and relocated some services to Exeter. Subsequently, the airline has ceased scheduled service operations all together. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 63 Current Position 5.26 Air Southwest and Air Wales were the only commercial operators from Plymouth City Airport in 2005. Recently Air Wale s announced that it is to withdraw from both the Dublin and Cork services at the end of the year and those to Cardiff and onward connections f rom the end of February, leaving services to London Gatwick, Bristol, M anchester, Leeds (via Bristol) and Jersey operated by Air Southwest alone. 5.27 Air Southwest has also recently announc ed changes t o their schedules from Plymouth as discussed in Section 2. Additionally, the airline is expanding the range of destinations served from Newquay and Bristol. The intention by Air Southwest is that passengers will not have to change aircraft and will be less affected by delays, thereby improv ing the overall service from Plymouth even with the reduction in flights to Manchester. 5.28 Overall, the Airport handled 10 9,000 pas sengers in 2005. Although this represented little growth over 2004, t hat year saw a 52% increase in passengers handled over the total for 2003. Growth continued into the first half of 2005 but has stalled as a re sult of the short notice Air Wales withdrawals which have left insufficient time for a market response by Air Southwest and other carriers to date. 5.29 Where services are not available directly from the Plymouth passengers currently have four options: 4 travel by road to another airpor t, primarily Bristol and Exeter for domestic and near European destinati ons and London Heathrow for European and long haul destinations; 4 travel by air to London Gatwick (or theoretically Manchester) and connect to other air services; 4 travel by train to points within the UK; or 4 do not travel. Plymouth City Airport Study 64 York Aviation LLP5.30 Analysis of the most recent CAA surv ey data for Bristol and Exeter Airports (2003) along with London H eathrow and London Gatwick, reveals that there is a large number of travellers travelli ng by surface means to catch flights outside of the sub-region. In Table 5.3, we illustrate the underlying demand for a range of destinations in 2003 from Devon and Cornwall and the percentage of that demand which comes from the cities of Plymouth and Exeter. Table 5.3: Underlying Air Passenger Demand from Devon and Cornwall, 2003 Destination Total Passengers % of Demand originating from Plymouth City % of Demand originating from Exeter City Aberdeen 3,950 47 2 Alicante 76,730 11 11 Amsterdam 27,900 15 17 Belfast 46,670 25 17 Brussels 9,410 7 5 Dublin 47,860 24 17 Edinburgh 67,140 18 13 Frankfurt 17,170 13 4 Glasgow 50,830 39 7 Malaga 87,240 14 9 Palma 83,520 17 13 Paris 34,280 14 8 Source: CAA Survey Data 5.31 The effects of expanded low cost carrier services from Bristol and Exeter will have seen these figures grow further in 2004 and 2005, although it is not possible to determine the exact amount of growth related to Cornwall and Devon as no further origin /destination surv eys have been carried out in the Region. We base our projections, henc e, on the pattern of demand revealed in the 2003 survey. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 65 5.32 Plymouth City Airport could not be ex pected to attract all of the underlying local demand because the economics of the aircraft suitable for operation from the Airport do not allow fares to be offered as low as those which may be available from Bristol or , increasingly, Exeter. T herefore, some travellers will still choose to make the journey to the other airports where lower fares are available, whatever t he offer from Plymouth. A dditionally, there are other factors which influence the choice of airport used, for example the frequency of services or the choice of airline. 5.33 What the CAA data does not show is t he number of travellers e ither making their journey by another means (car/train ) or not making a journey at all. This is particularly relevant in domestic markets. Offering flights at the right fares stimulates passengers to travel and the level of this would be determined by both the fare and the attractiveness to travel between two cities. Market Scope 5.34 In establishing the potential for Pl ymouth City Airport going forward, it is necessary to understand the scope of des tinations which could be served both now and in the future. The issue of what aircraft types are likely to serve the Airport in the future is pivotal to this issue. This means that many destinations cannot physically be served from Plymouth both now or even with an extended runway. 5.35 The proximity of Plymouth to both Ne wq uay and Exeter airports means that there is an overlap in catchment ar eas. Hence, competition between the Airports for passengers is material. Our core scenarios assume that both competitor airports remain in operation and develop in line with their own markets, notwithstanding current uncertainties rega rding their ownership and operation. Plymouth City Airport Study 66 York Aviation LLP5.36 Our analysis would suggest that there may be a variety of factors influencing passengers' choice of airport. For ex ample, based on the journey times from various points in Cornwall, Plymout h City Airport may present a better alternative for flying to selected areas of the county than Newquay would be, yet Newquay clearly has stronger market penetration in these areas. This may indicate a market perception pr oblem for Plymouth City Airport which prevents it from achiev ing its full potential as some passengers may be travelling via Newquay Airport despite a longer surface journey time, even on flights which operate from both airports. 5.37 Under any scenario where Plymouth Cit y Airport remains restricted to the current runway length, services will be limit ed to destinations within the UK and some closer points in continental Europe within the range of the current aircraft types. Paris, Brussels a nd Amsterdam could physically be served, although destinations such as Frankfurt and Barcelona could not. This is because the aircraft types currently in use at Plymouth would be required to operate at below economical passenger levels in order to achieve the longer range with the runway length available. This will obviously impact on the ability of Plymouth City Airport to develop new services should no runway extension be provided in the medium to long term. Limiting the prospects of securing growth and attaining profit able operations would make the the prospect of airport closure real, parti cularly if existing services were withdrawn as a result of the operating restrictions. 5.38 The use of high speed turbo-prop aircraft (such as the Dash8-Q400) or regional jet aircraft (such as Embraer E170s and E190s) would make a wider range of destinations over a longer distance more viable. In some cases, this could deliver signif icant passenger throughput, parti cularly if an airline could operate a regional jet service to Mediterranean leisure destinations economically. Increasing t he throughput would improve the financial viability of the Airport, reducing the risk of closure. Howeve r, the use of the Dash8- Q400 and the next g eneration of larger regional jets will require a runway extension. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 67 5.39 It must also be accept ed that the current types operated from Plymouth will have a limited lifespan, al beit that this may extend to a period beyond 2020. Currently both the Dash8-Q300 and the ATR-42 are still in production, but both aircraft are essentially designs fr om the 1980's, alt hough that they have been upgraded over time. Continued pro duction of these types has been helped by a recent resurgence in orders. However, a review of these orders shows that many of them are for replacement aircraft and not for new fleets. Consequently, the economic production life of the types may not extend greatly beyond 2010, especially given that regional jets are now receiving more orders than turboprops. Should production end by 2010 then there is a real possibility that by 2025 there may be limited aircraft still in operation in Europe that could use Plymouth City Airp ort at all, unless the runway is extended. Generally, the trend for the manufacturers is towards larger turboprops, offering better speeds and economics, or regional jets. 5.40 This movement to larger aircraft reflects an historic trend. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a heavy reliance on 19-30 seat turbo-prop aircraft within the UK, however these aircraft have become almost obsolete, with only small niche carriers continuing to us e such aircraft. Air Southwest has highlighted to us that in the 19 70s and early 1980s, manufacturers were keen to promote their aircraft as capable of short take-off and landings (STOL aircraft), but that the market has now moved away from this requirement for most operational air ports. Manufacturers have, hence, ended production of most STOL types, although some airports, such as Plymouth, still require STOL type ope rations. As current types are withdrawn from service, it does not appear likely that there will be sufficient demand overall to see new STOL types ent er the market for commercial air services. 5.41 Plymouth City Airport and Sutton Harbour Holdings have put forward two development options to achieve a gr eater runway length necessary to secure the future for the Airport. The two proposed lengthening schemes differ in that the shorter option (in te rms of physical construction) would use the RESAs at each end as starter extensions to provide a take-off distance of 1,319m but with restrict ions on the landing distan ce available. In the longer options, a runway length of 1,319m would be provided for both landings and take-offs, with the required RESAs at both ends. In this latter scheme, it is not proposed to use the RESAs as starter strips as, although this would provide still greater r unway length, it would have broader implications for airport ca tegorisation and facilities required which would be unachievable given the proximity of housing to the Airport. Plymouth City Airport Study 68 York Aviation LLP 5.42 Of these options, the longer would allo w bot h the Embraer regional jets and Dash8-Q400 to operate, whilst the shorter option would only permit the latter with certainty59. Bombardier, the manufacturer of the Q400, has confirmed that the runway length proposed, ev en on the shorter option, will be adequate for a number of destinations in Europe using Q400 aircraft. We discuss the physical implications of t hese two development options in the Section 6 . Forecast Methodology 5.43 The aim of our forecasting work has been to establish 'order of magnitude' passenger figures at Plymouth City Air port over the period to 2030 under different development scenario s. In order to do this, we have looked at the possible range of destinations which c ould be served, both with and without a runway extension (and also without the additional RESA). 5.44 The passenger forecasts are a theoret ical estimate of the potential for Plymouth City Airport. They have been created using our forecasting model, which examines how passengers to a gi ven destination would choose to use different airports based on their acce ss time and the nature of the service offered at competing airports. We have made assumptions about changes in services at the neighbouring airports ov er time. Actual growth at Plymouth City Airport will be highly dependent on attracting airlines to initiate new services, which in turn will depend on the attractiveness of airport facilities. 59 The actual operational performance of new generation regional jets will need to be validated in operation and the decision on runway length required for any service is in part a decision of the airline operating the aircraft. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 69 5.45 We have used CAA survey data fo r 2003 (South West Airports) and 2004 (London and Manchester Airports) to establish the underlying demand for individual routes which ar e considered as possible future destinations. From the outset, it was recognised that ther e would be limitations on the use of CAA data given the lack of data collected at Plymouth City Airport itself. We have verified the performance on existing routes using data supplied by the Airport itself. Where necessary, the figures have been grossed up to 2004 levels in order to establish a base case , thus taking account of new market entry at Bristol, Exeter and Newquay. In addition, an adjustment has been made for routes which are operated by low cost carrie rs out of Bristol that have stimulated the market with fare s lower than those which could be economically charged for flights from Plymouth. 5.46 Over the period to 2030 we have l ook ed at three possible development scenarios. These are: 4 Plymouth City Airport with no runway extension; 4 Plymouth City Airport with a short runway extension; 4 Plymouth City Airport with a longer runway extension; 5.47 For those where a runway extensi on is provided, we have produced low, medium and high passenger growth pr ojections. We have produced only a central estimate for the runway constr ained scenario. We have also looked at the upside potential for the Airpor t, against a high growth and longer runway scenario, in the circumstances where Newquay Airport closed to civil passenger flights and some routes and passengers were attracted to use Plymouth instead. We believe that this is a relatively unlikely outcome. Although we report this scenario here, we do not believe it is a sound base upon which to plan the future of Plymout h City Airport unless it is confirmed that the long term future of Newquay Airport is not secure. Plymouth City Airport Study 70 York Aviation LLP5.48 Under the scenario in wh ich there is no runway extension, the Airport could, in theory, choose whether to add a RESA or not. This is reflected in the forecasts as our single scenario in e ssence assumes no lim itation other than that to existing aircraft types, which is itself a function of the runway length and acts as a constraint on growth. However, the recent temporary restriction imposed by the CAA on t he daily movements could reflect a possible move to restrict the Airport in the longer term if the easterly RESA was never provided. Alt hough, the CAA has current ly concluded that the Airport can operate without this RESA, this is likely to be continually reviewed. This represents a signific ant risk to the achievement of the forecasts under this scenario. 5.49 Our low growth forecasts, even wit h a short runway extension, are no greater than those for the runway rest ricted scenario as we have assumed a take up of demand largely by existing airlines and smaller aircraft types. However, the provision of the runway extension give s greater certainty that at least this level of traffic will be reac hed as the threat of further restriction by the CAA would be lifted. However, in reality, the provis ion of an extended runway length is likely to lead to in creased traffic growth and a wider range of aircraft types operating in the medium to long term as reflected in the higher growth scenarios. 5.50 We have assumed that t he regional low c ost airline model will be prevalent at Plymouth given the pos ition of Air Southwest in this market and the likelihood that other new entrants will operate to a similar business model. However, the types of aircraft used fo r regional low cost services are not sufficiently efficient to allow a carrier to offer fares for \u00a31, the type of deal which can be offered by Ryanair because it operates larger aircraft. Even with a runway extension, the Airpor t will never be in a position to handle airlines like Ryanair and easyJet. This affects the market penetration which Plymouth can achieve on routes operated by such carriers from neighbouring airports. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 71 5.51 In Table 5.4, we set out the potential over all demand for services from Plymouth in the period 2010-2030 under the various scenarios. These scenarios assume that the Airport is abl e to attract airlines to operate the necessary routes and that it remains price competitive. It should be noted that these projections were prepared before the effect of the Air Wales service withdrawals were clear. Although we believe that these demand levels are achievable in the longer term based in th e strength of the local market, there are clear uncertainties in the short term about the ability of the Airport to sustain growth, particularly with the existing physical layout and restriction on aircraft types. 5.52 The range from low to high in re levant scenarios reflects the range of uncertainty around how successful the Airp ort will be in attracting substantial additional services and levels of market stimulation or transfer from surface modes. Furthermore, whilst a fuller range of routes may eventually be attracted with a runway extension as indicated in t he medium and high scenarios, these would not all come on line with the immediate opening of the facility and may only commence in the period between 2020 and 2030. 5.53 A critical issue in pr eparing these forecasts is the assumption regarding the transfer of passengers from surface to air modes on domestic routes and the amount of newly stimulated air passenger demand on new scheduled international services. We have tested low, medium and high levels of air market stimulation. However, it needs to be recognised that the higher of these may only be achievable in the long term through the successful transformation of the city inline with the 'MacKay Vision' and City Growth Strategy leading to accelerated grow th in local dem and and significant attraction of inbound visitors. 5.54 Assuming a successful uptake of serv ices by airlines and with the City making progress towards the achievement of the Vision, the medium level forecasts represent a best estimate of the potential for the Airport over the longer term, albeit short term perform ance may lag behind this mid range until improved infrastructure is in place. However, it shoul d be noted that to the extent that the development of a r unway extension or full RESA provision is delayed, the forecasts at 2010, in particular, remain a theoretical statement of potent ial rather than a forecast outturn.

The l ease stipulates a maximum of 16,000 commercial (passenger flights) move ments (arrivals and departures) per annum alongside a maximum of 20,000 general aviation (training and private flights) movements, although there is some scope for rebalancing between the two categories of movem ent. This issue is furt her discussed in Section 6, as the inability to raise movements above the total of 36,000 could hamper the ability of the Airport to become financially viable and self- sustaining in the long term. We understand that the matter of movement caps would be subject to renegotiation wit h the City Council in relation to any of the development scenarios. 5.56 In Table 5.5 , we set out the maximum pass enger potential under three of the scenarios if the movement caps set out in the lease were retained. We have assumed that general aviation movement s (including FOST and training activity) would be retained at 2004 le vels and that co mmercial movements would be increased to the maximum per mitted (so 16,000 plus a 2 for 1 exchange on the remaining 1, 500 general aviation moveme nts) of 16,750 air transport movements per annum. Table 5.5: Total Passengers Per Annum, 2010 - 2030 With Runway Movement Limits Scenario Year No Runway Extension Short Runway Extension with RESA (Medium Growth) Long Runway Extension with RESA (Medium Growth) 2010 370,000 400,000 400,000 2015 480,000 510,000 510,000 2020 520,000 550,000 550,000 2030 705,000 745,000 745,000 Source: York Aviation LLP Plymouth City Airport Study 74 York Aviation LLP5.57 If the limitations on movem ents are not lifted, it woul d be very difficult for the Airport to realise the benefit from extending the runway. The cap would prevent most new routes from starting, unless at the expense of existing routes. Hence, raising the movem ent limit would be an essential requirement if the Airport is to be dev eloped to its maximum potential and to secure the viability of any extension option. 5.58 We set out the likely frequencies of services and routes under the medium scenario for each dev elopment option in Table 5.6. In this case, we have tested the effects of 3 levels. Table 5.6: Example w eekly frequencies from Plymouth City Airport at 2030 No Runway Extension Short Runway Extension Long Runway Extension Destination Aberdeen 12 12 12 Amsterdam 12 14 14 Barcelona 0 0 5 Belfast 14 12 12 Bristol 21 21 21 Brussels 7 7 7 Cork 4 7 7 Dublin 19 12 12 Edinburgh 14 12 12 Frankfurt 0 0 7 Glasgow 19 12 12 Guernsey 5 7 7 Jersey 21 21 21 Leeds/Bradford 12 19 19 London (LGW) 28 42 42 Malaga 0 0 8 Manchester 12 19 19 Newcastle 7 12 12 Norwich 7 12 12 Nottingham (EMA) 7 12 12 Palma 0 0 7 Paris (CDG) 12 12 12 Rennes 4 4 4 Source: York Aviation LLP Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 75 Airline Views 5.59 We have discussed the potent ial for the Airport with a nu mber of airlines. At present, the restricted length of runway presents a substantial deterrent to airlines considering additional operations to Plymout h. Only Air Southwest appears committed to developing services to/from Plymouth with the current operational restrictions. We spoke to Air Wales but were unable to substantiate in full its reasons for suspending services and relocating some operations to Newquay or Exeter, al though it would appear to have been connected to more general difficulties be ing experienced by the airline rather than the Plymouth market itself. Flybe co nfirmed that it has no interest in Plymouth, preferring to serve th e area from its base at Exeter. 5.60 Other regional airlines, such as Aer Arran, have indicated to us that they would be prepared to consider operations t o Plymouth if the runway was of sufficient length and, importantly, if the commercial terms offered by the Airport were attractive. This is signific ant as it indicates that the Airport will have to be willing to offer discounted air port charges to secure growth, which has implications for ai rport profitability. 5.61 In the short term, Air Southwest is the on ly airline committed to operating and developing services from Plymouth. This high dependency on a single airline leaves the Airport vulnerable to any changes in commercial strategy, although the impact of this is likely to be cushioned in the short term by the joint operation of the Airport and the Airline as a single aviation division within Sutton Harbour Holdings. 5.62 In order to secure long term growth, it is highly desirable that the Airport attracts and retains other airline oper ators. Our market analysis would suggest that the market is potentially strong enough locally to allow this to happen. However, it does app ear that attracting additional airlines will be practically impossible under the curr ent runway length restrictions. 5.63 Further thought may also need to be gi ven to airport pricing policies and to other incentives to attract airlines to start new services and to mitigate the risks. Our financial analysis in the ne xt section considers some of the issues. We would recommend that a ma rketing strategy is drawn up to realise the potential of the Airport. Plymouth City Airport Study 76 York Aviation LLPConclusion 5.64 We have set out projections for the potential of Plymouth City Airport. The passenger projections set out in this r eport are significantly higher than those put forward by past studies. This is a result of the changing nature of the airline business in which regional airli nes, operating into airports such as Plymouth, are increasingly providing lo w fare services, stimulating demand and encouraging travel by air. However, there are risks to achieving these forecasts whilst infrastructure restri ctions remain in place. 5.65 It must be highlighted that the projections a re only realisable if airlines can be attracted to serve the Ai rport and our analysis sugges ts that this is only likely to be achieved on a sustainable basis with a longer runway in place giving greater operational flexibility. Thus, we would place greater confidence on the longer term projecti ons under scenarios where a runway extension is provided that on the short term projections and those relating to the present restricted scenario. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 77 6 DEVELOPMENT OPTION S AND VIABILITY Key Points 4 A critical issue for the Airport is the need to provide adequate runway end safety areas at both ends of the runway. Failure to provide a eastern RESA may result in operations at the Airport being restricted. 4 The major construction issue is the provision of an embankment upon which to locate the RESA. This involves substantial land acquisition to the east of the Airport. Provision of an extended runway involves only incremental construction. 4 Growth of traffic at the Airport will require larger apron and terminal areas. These will be more cost effectively provided as extensions to the existing terminal and apron using space released when runway 06/24 is closed. 4 Other critical facilities are the two ha ngars and engine test bay necessary to support Air Southwest's base at the Airport. Relocation of the engine test bay offers an opportunity to mitigate some of the noise nuisance from early morning engine tests. 4 We illustrate an optimum layout for the Airport to accommodate future growth, whilst releasing land on the runway 06/24 site for commercial development. 4 4 ap requiring further investment by Sutton Harbour Holdings and the public sector. Achieving sustainable operations is critically dependent upon growth and being able to attract more airlines and air services. A longer runway is essential to achieving this aim. Our analysis would suggest that, even allowing for reinvestment of all sale proceeds from the disposal of the 06/24 land, there will still be a funding g Infrastructure options 6.1 In Section 2, we have outlined the current airport facilities. In this section, we go on to consider future infrastructure requirements. In considering these infrastructure requirements, we have also taken into account proposals to close runway 06/24 and release land for commercial development to assist in funding t he required infrastructure improvement works. Plymouth City Airport Study 78 York Aviation LLPRESAs and the Runway Extension 6.2 As described in Section 2, the ma in runway has a compliant RESA of minimum length (90m) at its western end, provided through diversion of the A386. However, there is no compliant RESA at the eastern end and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) recently placed restrictions on the number of commercial movements at the Airport whilst reviewing the need for one to be provided. The CAA has subsequently permitted the Airport to continue operating without the eastern RESA subject to a limitation to current aircraft types but with no specific limit on the number of mo vements. Nonetheless, there is the potential threat that in the future the CAA may insist upon a RESA being provided if grow th at the Airport is to be allowed to continue as the Airport, in its current configuration, is not fu lly compliant with aerodrome licensing requirements and is operati ng under a derogation which could be withdrawn. 6.3 A critical issue for t he Airport is whether to provide the eastern RESA: 4 at all, running the risk t hat the effective runway length may need to be reduced; 4 as a 90m RESA, below that recommended by the CAA, although matching the currently accepted prov ision at the we stern end of the runway; 4 as a 120m RESA, with adjustment to the western RESA to provide 120m in each runway direction; 4 as part of a scheme to extend the runway to overcome some of the operational restrictions on the types of aircraft which can use the Airport, either with 90, or 120m RESAs at both ends. 6.4 It should be noted that all options, except the first, would involve construction of an embankment on land to the east of the Airport, involving acquisition of adjacent land at a substant ial cost. This would involve the removal of industrial properties and the creation of a rais ed earth embankment to support the runway and RESA. Landing lights would likely extend further to the east beyond the airport boundary. This physical arrangement is applied at other airports and, pr ovided gradients and the width of the runway strip comply with regulations, will be accept able to the licensi ng authority, the CAA. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 79 6.5 Given the view taken by the safety regulator, the CAA, we would endorse airport operator's desire to provide RESAs at both ends of the runway, in line with the CAA recommendations. It is li kely that the Airport could face significant operating restri ctions if the CAA's requi rement for RESAs is not complied with. However, simply providing RESAs does little to improve the runway length restriction on aircraft performance, described in Sections 2 and 5. In Figure 6.1, we illustrate a basic scheme for providing fully compliant RESAs. As a minimum th is would involves constructing an embankment to the east of the Airport. 6.6 Given the work involved in cons tructing compliant RESAs, it appear s sensible to consider the merits of constructing a runway extension concurrently so providing a real improvement in air port facilities. There are two options to extend the actual runway length by either an extra 48m or 158m as part of the same scheme. These are illustrated in Figures 6.2 and 6.3. In this case of the longer schem e, the nature of the construction will simply be an extended embank ment stretching further to the east, although the number of affected industrial properti es will be the same. As we outlined in Section 2, this additional runw ay length will enabl e a wider range of aircraft types, and hence destinations, to be served from Plymouth, as well as enabling current operations to per form more optimally. We summarise the runway geometry under each option and a 'do nothing' scenario in Table 6.1. The shorter runway scheme coul d form a first phase of development and land would need to be safeguarded in the LDF for the full extension.

However, under this scheme, the airport runway woul d only be 1,209m for the purposes of landing, as aircraft cannot land on the RESA. The advantage of this scheme over the longer scheme outlined below is that the ac tual amount of embankment needed beyond that to be provided for a RESA would be marginal. 6.8 The full 158m extensi on would provide a runway lengt h of 1,319m for both landing and take-off. This length of runway represents the longest permissible Category 2 runway, as the main constraining factor is the overall width of the runway strip at 150m. This runway strip is not just the width of the runway itself, 30m, but a flat gr aded and clear surface stretching for 75m either side of the runway centreline along its entir e length. If a runway of more than 1,319m were to be provided then it would become a Category 3 runway and actually require the runway strip to be 300m wide, wh ich is not possible at Plymouth as this would overspill in to large areas of developed land both to the north east and south west of runway 13/31 and require considerable re-contouring of the land. Plymouth City Airport Study 86 York Aviation LLP 6.9 Each of these runway extension opt ions can be provided without interfering with any of the other ai rport operations and associated infrastructure, although there might be some potential disruption during construction. PSZs 6.10 A further consideration in respect of runway layouts and safeguarding within the LDF is the question of public safety zones (PSZ s), which are established around commercial airports by the UK Go vernment to reflect the residual risk to third parties from an aircraft accident occurring outside the airport boundary. Whilst air transport is generally safe, accidents do sometimes happen and worldwide accide nt data show that the most risky phases of flight are take-off and landing in the vicinity of an airport. 6.11 A PSZ is an area of land at the end of eac h runway within which development is restricted in order to minimise the number of people on the ground at risk of death or injury in the ev ent of an aircraft crash on take-off or landing. Following a consultation exercise in 1997, the UK Government established new criteria for the size and shape of PSZs using 'risk contours' based on the number and types of aircra ft expected to be operating at any airport in future. Generally, the risk is relatively low from modern commercial aircraft with higher risk attached to milit ary and general aviation aircraft. The UK Government have established two re levant risk contours; the first is 10-4 risk contour where the risk to an indivi dual resident in the area is deemed to be unacceptable and properties should be removed. The second is the 10-5 risk contour where intensification of land use leading to increased number of people living or working in an area s hould be avoided through the planning system. 6.12 The shape of each contour is a tri angle. A diagrammatic representation of these contours is shown in Figure 6.4. The smaller 10-4 (1:10:000) risk contour will usually cover an area of land mainly contained within the boundary of the airport. The larger 10-5 (1:100,000) risk contour will extend beyond the boundary of the airport. They bot h start at the end of the runway. The width and length of each risk contour triangle will be di fferent for every airport dependent on traffic mix. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 87 Figure 6.4: Diagram of Risk Contours End of Runway 1:10,000 Risk Contou r 1:100,000 Risk r Source: York Aviation LLP 6.13 The current PSZs at Plymouth have been established based on the current quantity and mix of fli ghts. We are advised by Pl ymouth City Airport that the 10-5 risk contours associated with the main runway 13/31 ex tend to a point approximately 1 km from the ends of t he runway along a line extending from the centreline of the runway. If the runw ay is extended at either end then the PSZ contours will shift by the same distance. 6.14 As traffic levels develop to meet foreca st growth then it is likely that the size of the risk contours will need to be reca lculated. As explained above, these calculations take in to account the num bers of movements, the mix of traffic and the density of population that resi des within the affected areas. Whilst the forecast growth in traffic is comme rcial flying, which statistically has a lower accident rate than GA flying and mi litary activity, it would be prudent to assume that Plymouth City Airport's PSZ will probably lengthen slightly in terms of distance from the ends of the runway. We recommend assuming that new PSZs might stretch to 1.5km from the ends of the runway (an extension of 0.5km) in the fullness of time and that the width of the PSZs might widen by up to 50m ei ther side of the runway . This should form the basis of any safeguarding within the LDF, although the contours would need to be formally recalculated through the Department for Transport for formal safeguarding purposes. 6.15 Within the PSZ area, no 'new' high density development, such as houses, schools, shops, offices, etc, shoul d be permitted on land contained between the 10-4 risk contour and the 10-5 risk contour. New dev elopment of a low density, such as car parking, would be acceptable. Extens ions to existing housing etc, could be permi tted within this zone but not new housing. There is no impediment to r oads and other transport infr astructure passing through the PSZ. Plymouth City Airport Study 88 York Aviation LLP Terminal and Apron Capacity 6.16 Currently only 2 passenger aircra ft of around 50 seats each can be parked independently of eac h other in front of the termina l building. However, current operations require up to 3 airc raft to be parked at Plymouth at any one time. This is achieved through towing and repositioning of aircraft over night in preparation for the morning departure wave from circa 06:30 each day. The terminal is currently able to handle the volume of passengers using 3 early morning 50 seat departures. 6.17 Potentially growth in services, eit her with or without a runway extens ion, could lead to a need for more apron ar ea. If a runway extension is added then potentially aircraft of up to circ a 90 seats could us e the Airport and accommodating these would necessitate modifications and extensions to both the terminal and the apron. 6.18 In order to facilitate this, it woul d be n ecessary to close the short cross runway, runway 06/24. Closure of this runway is already proposed in the draft LDF to provide an area for mixed use development to the south of the Airport. Closure would also provi de space within the existing airport operational boundary to extend the apron pa rking zone, either side of the closed runway 06/24, a stub of which wo uld remain as a taxiway connecting the apron with the active main runway 13/31. Part of the area would also be used to provide the space required to ex tend the terminal by up to 20m in length and depth by building out onto the current apron. This will be sufficient to accommodate any of the fo recasts outlined in Section 5. 6.19 The precise nature of the terminal extens ion will depend on the likely flying pattern of the traffic. If all/most flights are with based aircraft then this will require a terminal at the t op end of the footprint in size as there will be a large number of departures first thi ng each day between c.06:30 and 07:30. If, on the other hand, there are a reasonable number of operations by aircraft originating from elsewhere then t hese aircraft will land after the based aircraft have already departed, resulting in terminal usage being less 'peaky'. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 89 6.20 Under any scenario with either pattern of based and visiting traffic, we consider that extending the existing terminal presents a much more cost effective solution than the original Sutton Harbour proposal to construct a new terminal adjacent to runway 13/31 accessed from the A386. This new terminal as originally proposed would not have met operating requirements due to runway side slopes restricting bui lding heights in the proposed area and the insufficiency of apron space. Whilst closure of runway 06/24 would allow relocation of the terminal, our analysis to date would suggest that there are no surface access grounds for considering an alternative site and access arrangements, indeed there may be advant ages in seeking integrated public transport solutions with the adjacent hospi tal and college. Also, construction of a new terminal, whilst costly in it self compared to in cremental expansion of the existing terminal, would not resu lt in a greater area of land being released for commercial development. Engine Test Bay and Aircraft Maintenance 6.21 Currently the British In ternational Hangar to the south west of the Terminal houses the maintenance work for Air Southwest. British International als o provides maintenance for the FOST helicopters and other 3rd party operators. The hangar is an essential element of th e airport infrastructure as, without it, based operations such as Air Southwest and FOST could not continue due to CAA rules which require that basic 'line' maintenance must be available and r outinely undertaken on all UK registered aircraft, which implies availability overnight and at the base of operations. 6.22 An essential component of this bas e maintenance activity is the need t o carry out engine run ups, or testing of the engines at full throttle, on the ground to ensure that repairs have been correctly and safely completed. This is particularly critical given Ai r Southwest's small fleet to ensure the readiness of all its aircraft for operations and to maintain network integrity. The relatively high number of such tests is a function of Air Southwest's home base being at the Airport. Plymouth City Airport Study 90 York Aviation LLP 6.23 To help mitigate the noise from engine run ups, Plymouth has a small rudimentary engine test bay located furt her to the south west of the hangar; however its design and construction has a very limited effect in containing the effect of run up noise giving rise to high levels of disturbance to neighbouring residential areas. The environmental implications are discussed further in Section 8 . It would be possible to improve this facility in its current location to bring it up to t he standard of 'best practice' engine test bays at other airports and improve noise mitigation. However, a decision whether to upgrade the present facilit y would depend on the strategy for releasing the southern part of the airport site for commercial uses. 6.24 Part of Sutton Harbour's strategy fo r securing the f uture viability of the Airport, including funding or any invest ment, rests on the ability to close runway 06/24 and for land containing the south western stretch of this runway to be sold/leased for mixed use development, as described later in this section. In order to maximise the amount of land which can be disposed of, and hence its value, it would be desirable to relocate the hangar and engine test bay closer to runway 13/31 but this would place it in closer proximity to housing requiring greate r noise mitigation measures. 6.25 From a noise mitigation perspecti ve, the best arrangement for these relocated facilities would be to co-loc ate them across the site of the closed runway 06/24, perpendicular to the te rminal and at the south western end of the current apron. This co-location would have the engine test bay located at the terminal end of this site and for the hangar stru cture to both aid supporting the engine test bay structure an d acting as a noise barrier from properties located along Tavistock Road. This scheme is illustrated in Figure 6.5. 6.26 It would also be prudent for the development of the released runway land to the south west of the relocated engine test bay to take account of noise, meaning t hat office and retail rather th an residential activity would be preferable at this end of the development site. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 91 6.27 If engine test bay and aircraft maintenanc e facilities cannot be re-provided at Plymouth City Airport, this will have a major impact on the operations of Air Southwest and FOST. As stated in Sectio n 4, FOST is of vital importance to the complete naval operations that ta ke place in the Plymouth area and the ability for FOST to have their flying activity at Plymouth helps underpin their ability to offer the full range of services they need to provide. 6.28 For Air Southwest, it could mean t hat they can no lon ger use Plymouth City Airport as their base and may have to re-t hink their strategy and relocate to another airport. It is by no means clear cut where this might be, with the next nearest geographically being Newquay and Exeter. Relocation to either would require a change to the pattern of their flying with aircraft generally not starting the routing form Plymouth as now and instead having to transit Plymouth. This might not be feasible for all current operations, let alone potential future ones and would reduce t he use of flights for day return business trips. Furthermore, such a mo ve would also inev itably mean some Air Southwest employees moving fr om Plymouth to nearer the new base airport and make it less likely that Air Southwest would grow its Plymouth operations. We believe that retaining the Air Southwest ba se at Plymouth is critical to ensuring the conditions fo r expansion of the route network, leave aside the implications for direct employment and other economic benefits from airport operations. Possible Schemes 6.29 The issue of the engine test bay position is fundamental to the full determination of future layouts and devel opment options. There is clearly a concern that moving the engine test bay cl oser to housing could result in a worsening of an already unsatisfactor y situation where noise from engine testing breaches EU noise limits at nearby housing. However, maximising release of land for commercial development is critical to securing the long term future of the Airport. Plymouth City Airport Study 92 York Aviation LLP 6.30 We illustrate two pos sible layout options in Figures 6.5 and 6.6; the former retaining the engine test bay in situ and the latter showing a possible relocation of the hangar and engine test bay to maximise land release. In both of these layouts, t he area shown as brown i llustrates the land which could be released for development. If the hangar and engine test bay are retained in their current locations, the land released would be around 9.6 acres, whereas by relocating these it would be possible to release 18.7 acres for development. Figure 6.5: Possible airfield layout for Plymouth City Airport, with engine test bay retained in current position Source: York Aviation LLP 6.31 In the latter of these schemes, we suggest that the new airport hangar provides one arm of the engine test bay. As the hangar would lie between the aircraft and the properties on Tavi stock Road, this would offer the prospect of further attenuation of the noise nuisance below existing levels as currently there is no effective barrier between the source of the noise and the properties. We would stress, however, that only detailed design work will determine the extent of noi se attenuation possible. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 93 Figure 6.6: Possible airfield layout for Plymouth City Air port, with engine test bay and hangar relocated Source: York Aviation LLP Financing the Development 6.32 Financial details regarding Plym outh City Airport are commercially confidential to Sutton Harbour Holdings as a public limited company. However, it is clear from our analysis, that passenger growth at the Airport is critical to attaining sustainable profitabl e operations. If the Airport is not able to grow because of either movement lim its imposed under t he lease or as a result of restrictions imposed by the Civ il Aviation Author ity because of the lack of full RESA provision, then profit ability will only be marginal even over the long term. Plymouth City Airport Study 94 York Aviation LLP 6.33 Improving the financial performance is dependent upon attracting airlines to operate potentially viable routes. Without a runway extension, there must be a high level of doubt that demand would be taken up to the maximum extent. In addition, we must stress once again t hat in the scenario with no extension and no RESA, the CAA may impose future restrictions on operations at the Airport, which could in turn affect the viability. Additionally, the fact that there may be few aircraft capable of operating into Plymouth by 2030 if no runway extension is provided could affect the long term ability to achieve profitable operations. 6.34 A runway extension and accompanying increase in movement limits are essential to securing the long ter m financ ial viability of the Airport and, hence, its continued operation. The principal issue in respect of the runway extension options remains the f unding of the development costs. Construction Costs 6.35 In late 2005, Sutton Harbour Holdi ngs commissioned a study t o confirm the costs of the potential devel opment schemes at the Airport. The two schemes which were considered were: 4 No main runway extension, but with RESA extended to 120m at the western end and a 120m RESA constructed at the eastern end; and 4 Main runway extension of 158m to 1319m, with the western RESA extended to 120m, and an eastern RESA of 120m added. 6.36 This work suggested that the ful l RESA scheme would cost of the order of \u00a313 million at current prices and the full runway extension scheme some \u00a324 million. The major cost element of the runway extension works comes from the need to provide sufficient land fill to bring the development area up to the same height as the existing airport si te. The studies undertaken for Sutton Harbour Holdings illustrate the costs of bringing this fill from sites within the wider South West and beyond. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 95 6.37 The costs of these developments pr ompted Sutton Harbour to consider a further development option - the shorter runway option, which was aimed at securing the majority of the advantages of the full longer runway extension scheme but with costs only marginally mo re than the full RESA only scheme. This scheme would provide a runway extension of 48m, along with a 90m RESA to the western end of the runway60. H o w e v e r , a s w e h a v e a l r e a d y discussed the take-off run for this schem e would also make use of the RESA land to provide the same take-off length as the longer scheme. No detailed costs have been prepared for this schem e but we have produced estimates based upon the costs and details provid ed during the study for the other schemes. 6.38 Based on the cost estimates described above, we have assumed that the option cost s would be \u00a313 million fo r the RESA only development, \u00a324 million for the longest development sc heme and \u00a314 million for the hybrid development scheme, providing a shorte r version of the extended runway. These costs, however, do not include the purchase of land for development or the design fees necessary. 6.39 More recently, further costings fo r the shorter runway extens ion and RESA have been prepared for Sutton Harbou r. These suggest that the construction costs of the scheme could be less than \u00a34 million. We find it difficult to reconcile these costs with ear lier estimates and therefore note that the construction cost for the short runway extension scheme is likely to be in the range \u00a34 to 14 million. Our analysis remains based on the higher figure as we have comparable costs for all options. It should be noted that this is, in essence, a worst case scenario if the short runway option, or indeed other options, can be delivered for lower cost. 6.40 The costing work undertaken for Su tton Harbour does not include the costs for the remainder of the airport development works. These fall into two parts: 4 those works necessary to release the land on runway 06/24 for development, including relocation of the engine test bay and hangar; 60 This is the same length as the present western RESA, which the CAA has accepted and assumes that the CAA would be willing to accept a 90m only for the eastern RESA. Plymouth City Airport Study 96 York Aviation LLP 4 those terminal and apron works required to accommodate longer term growth in passengers and movements. 6.41 In order to determine the overall co st of developing the Airport, we have compiled a set of best estimates of t he likely costs for the remaining works needed on site. These are illustrated in Table 6.4 . Development Estimated Cost Terminal Extension 2,000,000 New Hangar 600,000 New Engine Test Bay 300,000 Apron Extension and Hangar Floor 3,000,000Table 6.4: Non-Runway Development Costs (\u00a3) Source: York Aviation Airport Lease 6.42 Ownership of the airport site is co vered by a three leases between Plymouth City Council and Sutton Harbour Holdings Plc relating to different parcels of land. These relate to: 4 the Land Adjacent to Plymouth City Airport (covering the southern end of runway 06/24); 4 the Land Adjoining Plymbridge Road (c overing the north-western corner of the airport site, some land of which has now been provided for a Park and Ride); 4 Land and Buildings at Pl ymouth City Airport (cover ing the main airport site, including all of the elements required to maintain and run an airfield). Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 97 6.43 The first lease covering the land to the southern side of t he Airport, primarily occupied by runway 06/24, provides for the land to be so ld. There is a provision requiring SWRDA to be reim bursed for the costs of the western RESA works, Sutton Harbour Holdings to be reimbursed for defined airport operational losses and marketing cost s, and for the remainder of the proceeds to be split betw een the City Council and Su tton Harbour Holdings with a requirement that Sutton Harbour Holdings reinvests its share in the Airport. We discuss this requirement further below. 6.44 The second lease referred to above relates to land which has been transferred back to the City Cou ncil for construction of a park and ride facility as a consequence of the realignment of the A386 as part of the works to construct the western RESA. 6.45 The third lease covers the main operational airport site. Development Funding 6.46 We have considered how the devel opment could be funded. The ability o f the Sutton Harbour Holdings to sell or lease a sectio n of land to the south of the Airport would enable a potentially sign ificant pot of money to be raised. The land release could be between 9.6 ac res (if the engine test bay must remain in its current pos ition) and 18.7 acres ( with the engine test bay relocated). If the hangar and engine test bay cannot be relocated, this would save on the construction costs of replacement facilities but result in substantially lower proceeds from land disposal. 6.47 Under the lease, there are a number of restrictions on how this money can be distributed: 4 firstly, any monies raised from t he sale would have to be used to repay the investment made by SWRDA for the original western RESA work, road realignment and ai rfield improvements am ounting to some \u00a34.2 million; 4 secondly, the airport operator can ta ke a sum of funds equivalent to the losses of the Airport to that date; Plymouth City Airport Study 98 York Aviation LLP 4 finally, the remainder of the funds would be split equ ally between the airport operator and the City Council (as the freeholder), with an obligation on the airport oper ator to reinvest those funds in the Airport. 6.48 Our analysis would suggest that, at the very least, it will be necessary for the City Counc il to agree to reinvest its proc eeds from the disposal of the land in the Airport and for SWRDA to be approached to allow its earlier investment to be retained. Arguably, the value of this earlier investment may be negated if the eastern RESA is not also constructed, because any future operational restrictions imposed by t he CAA or long term viability issues could lead to its closure in any event. 6.49 Once the position of other stakeholders is clear, Sutton Harbour Holdings will be in a position to determine the extent of any further investment whic h is commercially justified. 6.50 We have estimated that there could be a funding gap of between \u00a32.4 million and \u00a317.9 million simply to fund a schem e to provide the required eastern RESA, although this gap is more likely to be towards the bottom end of the range if all monies from the land sale were reinvested. It must be remembered that whilst this scheme would remove the risk of CAA imposed movement restrictions, it may not secure the long term future of the Airport as aircraft types able to use the runway cease production and are retired from airline fleets. 6.51 The short runway extension scheme is estimated to cost only around \u00a31 million more than a RESA only scheme, making little difference to the funding gap but, by providing an extended runway, giving a much more secure future to the Airport in terms of the ability to attract new airline services. Clearly, the extent to which construction costs can be reduced in line with the most recent estimates could make a mate rial difference to the affo rdability of the scheme. 6.52 The longer runway development sc heme is estimated to increase the development costs by a further \u00a310 mi llion, greatly increasing the funding gap. This scheme would, however, fa cilitate stronger traffic growth by permitting operations by regional jet aircraft. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 99 6.53 It would, of course, be possible to di spose of the land to the south of the Airport without any substantial investm ent in new facilities. In these circumstances, SWRDA and the City Coun cil could recoup/realise a capital receipt whilst Sutton Harbour could use the proceeds to offset operational losses in the short to medium term. This option would not, however, protect the Airport for the longer term, either from the risk of constraints being enforced by the CAA if compliant RESAs are not provided or of airlines not being willing to develop services at the Airport. Conclusion 6.54 There are substantial ri sks inherent in all options: 4 no develo pment runs the risk of the CAA imposing further restrictions on the operation of the Airport; 4 provision of RESAs only would avoid further oper ational restrictions being imposed but would not ensure the long term growth of the Airport through attracting new airlines and services and may not generate sufficient profits to allow finance to be raised; 4 development of the short runway extension option would secure scope for growth but the remaining restriction on arrivals would still limit long term growth potential to turbo-prop aircraft only; 4 development of the long runway extension option would offer the greatest potential for the long term oper ational viability of the Airport but at the highest cost. 6.55 Taking into account the risks and potent ial benefits fro m the development of the Airport, the short runw ay option is currently t he favoured option of Sutton Harbour Holdings. On the basis of our analysis, this would still leave a funding gap of the order of \u00a38.4 million. The scale of the actual funding gap can only be determined once detailed cost ings for the preferred option have been prepared and once the proceeds from land disposal have been confirmed. Sutton Harbour Holdings will also need to confirm, by reference to a final business plan for the developm ent, the level of debt finance which it is willing to raise for the development. Plymouth City Airport Study 100 York Aviation LLP 6.56 We will explore the extent to whic h wider benefits from the development of the Airport would justify a public sect or contribution towards the costs of development under the various scenarios in Section 11. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 101 7 ECONOMIC IMPACT Key Points 4 In 2005, operations at Plymouth City Airport directly supported 222 full time equivalent jobs, including those employed at the Air Southwest base but excluding non aviation related companies housed at the Airport. 4 64% of employees live within the City of Plymouth. 4 Taking indirect and induced effects into account, the gross value added to the Devon and Cornwall economy of operations at Plymouth City Airport is \u00a312.2 million per annum currently, supporting 320 jobs. 4 By 2030, the Airport would support 710 to 960 jobs directly dependent on the growth scenario and length of runway available. Total employment sustained by the Airport in the sub-region would rise to between 1,090 jobs to 1,480 jobs dependent upon scenario. 4 The GVA added by the Airport would rise to between \u00a392.8 and \u00a3125.8 million per annum dependent upon the runway length and growth scenario. 4 4 in terms of air access at present and this will damage the City's competitiveness. 4 cities to materially improve its connectivity, requiring a longer length runway. 4 ived from the service to London Gatwick, saving long surface access journeys.

We would concur that there are significant ec onomic benefits for a region or city having easy access to air transport links or rather the absence of gPlymouth City Airport Study 102 York Aviation LLP 7.2 The question being addressed in this report is whether it is specifically important that Plymouth has an airport within its boundaries, as opposed to travellers being expected to use Exet er, or even Newquay Airports as the nearest alternatives. The Role of Airports in Economic Development 7.3 In the first instance, it is important to not e that airports facilitate economic growth at a regional level but also act as magnets for a wide range of economic activities. This wider economic role of airports is known as the catalytic impact , arising from the effect that air service accessibility can have on the region served by the Air port. The mechanisms through which it operates relate la rgely to enhancing business efficiency and productivity by providing easy access to suppliers and customers. In combination, these are called the catalytic impact of aviation. The effects are observed through the role of the Airport in: 4 influencing company location decis ions and competitiveness. The presence of an international airport can be a critical factor in: attracting new inward investment from outside the area, and especially companies from overseas; retaining existing companies in the area, whether they had previously been inward invest ors or indigenous operations; securing the expansion of existing companies in the face of competition with other areas; promoting the export success of companies lo cated in the area by the provision of passenger and freight links to key markets; enhancing the competitiveness of the economy, and the companies in it, through the provision of fast and efficient passenger and freight services; adding to the quality of life of citizens by enabling travel, notwithstanding local envi ronmental implications. 4 attracting business and leisure visitors and hence inbound tourism to the area, generating income and empl oyment in the tourism industry. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 103 7.4 It is often difficult to disentangle the role of an airport and air service accessibility from wider growth driver s in a regional or local economy. Hence air service access is an enabler, often being a necessary but not sufficient condition for economic growth . These catalytic benefits are in many ways more important than t he direct economic and employment impacts of the operation of the Airport itself, valuable though these may be in an area of high unemployment. Consequent ly, this is the primary focus of our analysis below, albeit we also look fi rstly at the more direct effects to provide a context for considering the measurable effects of the development options. Impact Methodology 7.5 In this section, we outline the current measurable ec onomic impact of operations at Plymouth City Airport. Th is has been undertaken through an on-site employers' survey, providin g information back to us regarding employment figures, employee home locations, salary expenditure and company expenditure on goods and services. 7.6 The overall approach we have adopted in order to estimate the economic impact of Plymouth City Airport is based on a framework of four categories of effect as set out in Table 7.1. 7.7 Our employment estimates are based on f ull-time equivalents (ftes), where full-time staff are counted as one empl oyee and part-time staff are counted as 0.5 of an employee. Seasonal staff are counted as 0.5 (full-time) and 0.25 (part-time). For this study, fu ll time is counted as more than 30 hours per week, and part time is less than 30. 7.8 Because our employment estimates ar e based on full time equiv alent jobs, it is important to recognize that some of the figures quoted in this section will be less than the actual number of employees who may be working on site at any given time.

Baseline Impact in 2005 Direct On-Site 7.10 The on-site survey reveals that direct on-site airport related employment is 222ftes, or 242 total job opportunities in 2005. In total, 6 companies and organisations employing staff on-site we re surveyed for this report. There are some employers occupying offices and other facilities on the site which are not aviation related, such as J ubb Consulting Engineers and Mowlem. These companies have not been included in the survey, as their employment and expenditure is not a result of airport operations, although they would form part of the on-site employment base in other employment censuses. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 105 7.11 The density of direct airport employment employment is der ived by adding the direct on-site employ ment with the direct off-site employment (see paragraph 7.18 below), whic h gives a total employment of 228 FTEs and therefore the density of direct employment in 2005 was 2,188 job opportunities per million passe ngers per annum (mppa). 7.12 The average on-site employment density at ai rports across Europe was 1,084 job opportunities per mppa in 20 03, based on a survey of 53 airports across Europe61. Plymouth City Airport current ly has a high employment density relative to the European average. However, this is not unusual at smaller regional airports due high fixed st affing levels in activity such as air traffic control and the fire service, whic h will not necessarily need to increase necessarily to handle more passengers. In addition, the current pattern of aircraft movements has 3 distinct peaks (early morning, lunchtime/early afternoon, and early evening), meaning th at passenger handling staff could be used for additional flights should there be a level of capacity filling between these current peaks. A further factor is th e existence of the Air Southwest base at the Airport whic h is a major employment generator. 7.13 It should also be noted that the ACI EUROPE study was based on 2002 data, whic h preceded many of the change s to employment structure in the aviation industry that took place following September 11th 2001 (9/11). These changes, including pressure on costs in the industry and increasing automation of functions such as check-in have resulted in productivity gains. More recent data is showing reducing employment densities across European airports, further emphasis ing the gap between the density of employment currently at Plymouth City Airport and the European 'norm'. Direct employment at Plymouth City Ai rport, thus, makes a greater local contribution than the scale of airport activity would otherwise indicate. To a material extent, this is driven by the Air SouthWest base which is a significant feature underpinning the economic contribution of the Airport. 7.14 Our analysis shows that currently 64% of the full time employees live within the City of Plymouth. Table 7.2 illustrates the distribution of residence for full time employees. 61 The Social and Economic Impact of European Airports 2003, York Aviation for ACI EUROPE Plymouth City Airport Study 106 York Aviation LLP Table 7.2: Residence of Ful l Time On-Site Workforce (%) Area Percentage of Workforce East Devon 0 Exeter 1 Mid Devon 1 North Devon 1 Plymouth 64 South Hams 3 Teignbridge 1 Torbay 2 Torridge 0 West Devon 4 Caradon 2 North Cornwall 4 Rest of Cornwall 10 Somerset 2 Dorset 1 Rest of South West 1 Rest of UK 4 Source: York Aviation LLP 7.15 Based on the wages and salaries of employees, income earned in Devon and Cornwall is \u00a35.52 million , of which \u00a34.17 million is income earned in Plymouth. The direct income generated in 2005 is shown in Table 7.3, along with the indirect and induced income. Direct Off-Site 7.16 In addition to the on-site j obs, some of the direct acti vities of airports can be located outside the operat ional area and as a 'rule of thumb' these are generally to be found within a 20-minute drive-time of an airport. It is, however, difficult to estimate this dire ct off-site employment because a 20- minute drive-time can translate into a relatively large geographical area. 7.17 As a counter balance, it must be remembered that some firms, such as Avis, employ a number of staff in the area, although not all of these will be related in any way to services at the Airport. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 107 7.18 On the basis of the survey we under took, we estimate that about 3% of the workforce for Plymouth City Airport is lo cated off-site, equating to 6 ftes. The difficulty of collecting information regar ding off-site employment means that an average from our ACI EUROPE study is not available for comparison. However, based on other work undertaken by York Aviation, this figure is lower than the average but not untypical of smaller unconstrained airports. Indirect 7.19 As outlined in Table 7.1, indirect employment and income is generated in the chain of suppliers of goods and servic es to the direct (on and off-site) activities. Based on the on-site survey of employers, we estimate that the Airport currently supports around 20 fte jo bs in the Plymouth. We estimate that this could add around \u00a31.02 million of income to the wider Devon and Cornwall economy, of which \u00a30.33 million is realised in the Plymouth economy. We estimate that additiona lly the Airport contributes a further \u00a35.68 million of indirect income to the rest of the UK. We consider only the beneficial impacts realised in the loca l area in considering the impact of future development options, although th is represents the smaller part of airport related supply chain expenditure. In common with much of regional airport activity across the UK, there is substantial leakage of expenditure on supplies and services outside of local economies in the vicinity of airports. The aviation industry supply chain re mains dominated by companies in the vicinity of the main London airports and th is will be a factor in the pattern of expenditure we have i dentified at Plymouth. 7.20 We estimate that the expenditure retained within the sub-region generates 51 FTE jobs. Induced 7.21 As illustrated in Table 7.1, induc ed employ ment and income is generated by the spending of the direct (on and off-site) and indi rect incomes. This equates to an income in Devon and Cornwall of \u00a30.91 million , of which \u00a30.29 million is income to Plymouth City. In turn, this expenditure sustains 10 FTE jobs in Plymouth and 47 in the sub-region. Plymouth City Airport Study 108 York Aviation LLP 2005 Impact Summary 7.22 Table 7.3 summarises the impact to Devon and Cornwall in 2005, the impact on Plymouth City is contained within this and discussed above. Table 7.3: Employment and Income Impact of Plymouth City Airport in Devon and Cornwall in 2005 Year Direct Indirect Induced Total Employment (FTE) 222 51 47 320 Income (million) \u00a35.52 \u00a31.02 \u00a30.91 \u00a37.46 Source: York Aviation LLP 7.23 We have prepared a Gross Value Added (GVA) calculation for the impact of the Airport on the Devon and Cornwall ec onomy. The GVA is calculated by dividing the total income for the region by a GVA factor, taken from the 2004 copy of National Trends in Statistics, with the factor currently being 0.61. In 2005, the GVA added by the Airport to the Devon and Cornwall economy was \u00a312.2 million. Future Impact 7.24 The expected economic impact of the Airport under various growth scenarios to 2015 and 2030 is determined by cons idering how employment will grow related to traffic growth. For the pur pose of this analysis, we consider the mid-range passenger forecasts for rele vant scenarios as representing the most likely levels of throughput in the longer term. Given the current high levels of employees relative to passenger numbers, we would anticipate productivity gains higher than the 2- 3% average which is currently being seen at regional airports. A further consideration wil l be the future development of the Air Southwes t operation and continuation of maintenance activities at the Airpor t. This is critically dependent on mitigating the environmental impact of associate eng ine testing activity as discussed in the next section. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 109 7.25 Some activities at the Airport may not grow inline with increases in passenger numbers, such as the operat ions of VT Aerospace, the MoD FOST facility or some elements asso ciated with Air Southwest. We have accounted for this by a marginal incr ease in the productivity gain of employment going forward to a higher figure than typically used at European airports (see paragraph 7.26) 7.26 We have estimated the future empl oyment and incom e impact of Plymouth City Airport on the basis of the following: 4 the present day estimates outlined above; 4 an assumption that the number of dire ct (on and off-site) jobs per million workload units per annum62 will fall by 3.5% per annum, as a result of productivity gains, from 2,188 ftes in 2005 to 1,262 ftes in 2015 and 894 fte jobs in 2030. 7.27 This assumption of a 3.5% per annum growth in pr oductivity is marginally above that observed at other major UK airports, which typically is between 2- 3% per annum. We have sele cted this higher growth rate to reflect the high employment density currently and the scope for more passengers to be handled by the same number of staff as the Airport grows and traffic becomes less peaky, in addition to the re cognition that some functions would not be expected to grow. This wil l be over and above general productivity gains in the aviation industry as a w hole. The figure of 894 ftes per million passengers per annum by 2030 would put the Airport at a similar employment density as curr ently seen at other regio nal airports in the UK whilst, by 2030, employment densities a major airports would be expected to be substantially lower due to economies of scale. 7.28 We have tested three scenarios for t he future impact of the Airport, and these are outlined in Table 7.4 . 62 One workload unit is equal to the movement of 1 passenger or 0.1 tonnes of freight Plymouth City Airport Study 110 York Aviation LLP Table 7.4: Future Impact Scenarios Scenario Description No runway extension Constrained to 50-seat aircra ft type s currently seen, but with the threat of long term restrictions should no RESA be provided. With shorter runway extension and RESA Constrained to turboprop airc raft, expect ed up to 70 seats With longer runway extension and RESA Unconstrained by runway length allowing regional jets in addition to turboprop ai rcraft. Sources: York Aviation LLP No runway extension 7.29 Table 7.5 (employment) and Table 7.6 (income) show estimates of the impact Plymouth City Airport will have if no runway extension is added (either with or without the provision of full RESAs). Under such a scenario, we anticipate that the Airport ma y be in a position to handle 480,000 passengers by 2015 and 790,000 by 2030, al though there ar e risks to the achievement of these traffic levels if the CAA imposes a further level of restrictions on the operations. All financial figures are at 2005 prices, with the survey having been undertaken in Autumn 2005.

However, it should be noted that due to efficiency gains in employment versus the relatively lo w increase in passenger figures after 2015, the direct on-site employment is projected to reduce by 10 employees by 2030. Taking indirect and induced im pacts into account, the impact on the City would be for the Airport to be supporting around 820 fte jobs and generate around \u00a322.11 million of inco me (at 2005 prices) at 2015, increasing to 830 fte jobs and \u00a336 .38 million of income by 2030. 7.31 The GVA of this scheme at 2015 is \u00a356.4 million, increasing to \u00a39 2.8 million by 2030, illustrating the potential for t he Airport to add va lue to the city economy if it is able to sustain growth in line with the potential market for air travel existing in and a ttracted to Plymouth. With shorter runway extension 7.32 Under this scenario, we antici pat e around 540,000 passengers per annum at 2015 and 890,000 by 2030. Table 7.7 illustrates the estimated employment impact of the Airport on Devon and Cornwall at 2015 and 2030 and Table 7.8 shows the estimated income. All figures are at 2005 prices.

Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 113 With longer runway extension 7.36 Under a scenario the number of aircraft types, and range of services offered would be expanded due to the extra runway length. Table 7.9 (employment) and Table 7.10 (income) show estimates of the impact Plymouth City Airport will have if all schemes are implement ed to achieve passenger growth to around 645,000 by 2015 and 1,075,000 by 2030. All figures are at 2005 prices.

Plymouth City Airport Study 114 York Aviation LLP With movement constraints 7.39 The scenarios presented above assume that restrictions on the number of aircraft movements under the c urrent air port lease are lifted. In the event that these restrictions ar e not lifted, we estimate that the Airport would be limited to approximately 540,000 passengers by 2015 and 820,000 passengers by 2030 even under development scenarios. Table 7.11 (employment) and Table 7.12 (income) illustrate the effects of limiting the growth of the Airport in line with the current lease restrictions. Table 7.11: Employment Impact of Plymouth City Airport in Devon and Cornwall in 2015 and 2030 (full-time equivalents), with runway extension with movement restrictions Employment Category Year Direct Indirect Induced Total 2015 760 180 160 1,100 2030 670 190 170 1,030 Source: York Aviation LLP Table 7.12: Income Impact of Plymouth City Airport in Devon and Cornwall in 2015 and 2030 (\u00a3 million), with runway extension with movement restrictions Year Direct Indirect Induced Total impact of such restrictions could be 280 less fte jobs in Devon and Cornwall by 2015 increasing to 450 less fte jobs by 2030. This would result in \u00a39.3 million less income to Devon and Cornwall by 20 15, increasing to \u00a323.2 million less income by 2030 if the restrictions are retained. Of this the impact on Plymouth City woul d be 220 fewer fte jobs by 2015 and 340 fewer fte jobs by 2030. Financially, the Cit y would suffer a reduction of \u00a36 million of income by 2015 and \u00a315 million by 2030. 7.41 The GVA to Devon and Cornwall with movement restrictions would at 2015 is \u00a356.3 million, increasing to \u00a387.6 million by 2030.

These impacts are virt ually impossible to quantify as it is impossible to isolate the impact of air service accessibility on company location and expansion decisions. 7.44 We have described in Section 4, the key economic growth drivers for Plymouth which require a step change in performance overall. It would appear to us that in the circumstanc es where such a step change in economic performance is required, as implied by the Mackay Vision, improvements air service accessibility will be essential to underpin a more successful and globally competitive economy . This is particularly true in respect of target growth sectors such as creative and hi gh-tech industries and the bio-medical sector. Overall, catalytic impacts are likely to be more significant than the direct measurable benefits of air port operation described above. Plymouth City Airport Study 116 York Aviation LLP 7.45 However, quantifying catalytic impact in terms of employment or income is simply not possible. The relationship between the availability of air services and the benefits to the city region descr ibed above is extremely complex and consequently cannot be modelled in any sens ible fashion. Therefore, we will seek to examine two measurable effect s of the Airport as proxies for the extent to which the region can ma ximise benefits of this nature: 4 Value Connectivity whic h is a measure of how development of air services will support the development of the City of Plymouth and Devon and Cornwall as places to do business; 4 Journey Time Savings accruing to passengers as a result of additional direct services being available at Plymouth, converted to monetary values as a measure of consumer benefits from the development of Plymouth City Airport. 7.46 A third measure which could be quant ified would be incremental tourist revenues arising from the development. However, bec ause of uncertainties about the tourism strategies for Plymout h and the extent to which these will be successful in attracting new visitors, we have conservatively not attempted to place a value on thes e benefits, although we discuss them below. Measuring Connectivity 7.47 As a basis for analysing the contribution of air services to city performance, York Aviation has developed a connectivity index for cities based on: 4 the available scheduled services at airports within defined surface journey times from the relevant city; 4 the frequency of these scheduled services; 4 a scoring of the destinations served bas ed on the classification of world cities developed by the Globalis ation and World Cities Network (GaWC) at Loughborough University; 4 the journey time to the relevant airports. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 117 7.48 This data has been used to develop an indicator known as Value Connectivity which values each destination based on the GaWC score. This score is then multiplied by the frequency of service and once again weighted by the logarithm of the journey time to the airport offering the service, with a preference given to airports falling wit hin a designated journey time. This produces an indicator of the overall value of the services on offer in terms of the economic importance of destinations served. It can be used to measure the relative connectedness by air of different cities as places to do business or compare the impact of different airport growth strategies to city connectedness. 7.49 For the purpose of this analysis, the re sult for Plymout h is indexed to 100 to provide an overall connectivity rating. This can then be compared to some key benchmark, or 'aspir ational' cities within the UK and Europe. 7.50 In considering the connectivity of Plymouth and Dev on and Cornwall, it is important to take account of the ext ent to which these areas are presently served by a number of airpor ts. In Figure 5.1, we ha ve illustrated the other airports serving the region, taking as our reference point the fact that generally for inward investment decisi ons, the criterion applied is typically within 1 hour of an airport. 7.51 In each case we have produced a co nnectivity index for three different 'service areas': 4 Extended Service Area - this examines the connectivity offered by airports within 90 minutes drive time fro m the city centre; 4 Standard Service Ar ea - the connectivity offer ed by airports within 60 minutes drive time from the city centre; 4 Cit y Service Area - the connectivity offered by airports within 30 minutes drive time from the city centre. Plymouth City Airport Study 118 York Aviation LLP Comparator Cities 7.52 The use of comparator cities provides an indication of t he quality of the air service offer supporting a city. Plym outh City has clear aspirations to develop, and the visions outlined in the Mackay Vis ion gives clues about the type of city Plymouth aims to become. In terms of its ability to develop, the emerging strategy for implementing the Vision is to see Plymouth able to compete globally and to be c onnected to key business centres. We use the connectivity analysis to examine how well connected Plym outh is compared with other similar cities. In order to def ine a selection of comparator cities we have considered a number of issues: 4 remoteness of the city - to reflect the geographical location and difficulty of trave lling to Plymouth; 4 the type of city - this covers the aspirations of Plymouth to develop in line with the Mackay Vision to becom e a vibrant European cultur al city; 4 the population size of each city - again this reflects the aspirations set out in the Mackay Vision to achiev e a city population between 300-350,000. In addition, all of the cities we have c onsider ed have some form of waterfront location. Comparator cities were also suggested by the City Council in relation to the city growth aspirations. 7.53 It should be emphasised that attempti ng to identify compar ators is not an exact sc ience and in each case there will be many factors influencing city performance. Nonetheless, we consider that the cities selected provide a useful basis for exploring Plymou th's relative connectivity. In Table 7.14 we summarise the cities, and their relative air service connectivity taking all relevant airports into account. One ke y point to note is that in all but one case, Aarhus, the cities all have at l east one airport within 30 minutes of the city centre. Plymouth City Airport Study City Population Within 30 mins Within 60 mins Within 90 Mins Bilbao Santander Biarritz 613 733 336 Bordeaux 800,000 Bordeaux 587 596 215 Cardiff 305,000 Cardiff Bristol 95 104 163 Newcastle 260,000 Newcastle Durham Tees Valley 587 702 255 Plymouth National StatisticsCatchment Airports ConnectivityTable 7.14: Connectivity of Comparat or Cities, Summer 2005 Frequencies City Service AreaStandard Service AreaExtended Service Area York Aviation LLP 119 Plymouth City Airport Study 120 York Aviation LLP 7.54 Table 7.14 clearly illu strates the connectivity issue for Plymouth, with air service connectivity offered within t he City Service zone being substantially below many of the comparators, with t he exceptions of Aarhus and Cardiff, although in the case of Cardiff, the rail service to London is of a better quality. Additionally much of the connectivity for Plymou th is the result of the high frequency link to London, whereas in t he case of Cardiff the connectivity is achieved through a wider variety of se rvices from its local airport (with the train offering the substitu tion for the air link to London). 7.55 With only one exception - Aarhus in the Extended Service Area, Plymouth falls below all of the other cities in the two wider 'service areas'. It is particularly important to bear this in mind with relation to the location decision criterion of companies as described in par a. 7.3. Based on access to airports within 1 hour of the City, Plymouth's offer is close to that of Cardiff (remembering of course that Cardiff has higher quality surface access), but is surpassed by all of the ot her selected cities. This connectivity could affect not only the ability to attract inward inve stment but also inward tourism, which is increasingly reliant upon local air connectivity. 7.56 The key cities nominated as benchm ark comparators by the Council wer e Newcastle and Bilbao. W hen compared to both of these cities, Plymouth falls some distance behind for both the City Service Ar ea and the Standard Service Area, although it is closer w hen the Extended Service Area is taken into account. This would suggest that the quality of air services may be important to becoming a European cultural city similar to Newcastle or Bilbao. Whilst the air service offe r does not currently appear adequate to support the aspiration of growth, the lo ng term growth of the Airport may go some way to improving the position. The Effect of Airport Growth 7.57 In order to establish t he potential improvement to ai r service connectivity if the Airport is able to grow and improve the range of services it offers, we have considered the implications of new services being offered under the 3 main scenarios set out in Sections 5 and 6 on the basis of mid-range estimates of growth. In Section 5, we set out the likely range of destinations and anticipated weekly frequencies at 2030 under the medium growth scenario, assuming any extension/RESA works are completed by 2015. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 121 7.58 These frequencies have then been used to establish the air connectedness of Plymouth and four districts surr ounding Plymouth in future based on services offered by Plymouth City Airport alone in 2030. These are set out in Table 7.15. It is evident that the real gai ns in connectivity only arise if a longer runway is available enabl ing growth in absolute terms and connections to a wider range of cities. Table 7.15: Connectivity offered by Plymouth City Airport at 2030 under selected scenarios District Current No Runway Extension Short Runway Extension Long Runway Extension Caradon 332 354 776 858 Plymouth 359 383 839 927 South Hams 321 342 749 828 Teignbridge 307 327 717 792 West Devon 347 370 810 896 Source: York Aviation LLP 7.59 Table 7.16 provides an illustration of wher e this will place Ply mouth by comparison to the comparator cities. The future comparisons are purely against the current connectivity of the co mparator cities, as the principle is that Plymouth views the position of these cities as being the position it would like to be in beyond 2020. For clarity of comparison, all of the figures are indexed once again. 7.60 Even with the continued dev elopment of the Airport, an d taking no account in improvement in connectivity at these other cities, air service connectivity to Plymouth is still likely to lag behind the co mparator cities. This is partly a result of the type of operations which could take place from Plymouth. This does not mean that the improvements in connectivity offered by the Airport would not be valuable in te rms of helping the City achieve its Vision but that the City growth strategy cannot rely , even on the most optimistic scenario, on the Airport as a ke y driver of growth.

In addition, our methodology does not take into account the importance of improved domestic connecti ons to cities such as Belfast, Aberdeen and Newcastle, as they do not feature in the GaWC analysis. Given the length of surfac e access journeys to these key business cities, the opportunity to connect by air to these cities on a reliable basis could add further value not captured by the analysis here. Journey Time Savings 7.62 Journey time savings are a further measure of the benefit whic h having an airport brings to local travellers through more convenient access to air services. These savings are also a m easure of the way in which air service accessibility contributes to business produ ctivity. User benefits, which are an amalgam or journey time and air fare savings, form one of the key measures of the benefit of airport or air service development used in both the Future of Air Transport White Paper and in assessing the case of public sector investment in air services or the development of airport infrastructure. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 123 7.63 The estimate of the value of journey time savings is derived by using our forecast outputs to determine where trave llers would be required to fly from if the service they would use from Plymout h was not available. The model can be used to establish how m any travellers on a route would switch to using alternate services from Newquay, Exeter and Bristol Airports where available or onto surface modes to domestic destinations, in particular London. The additional journey time involved is estimated for passengers from each district within Plymouth's catchment area. 7.64 For each district the displaced pass engers are then divided into their type, UK bus iness traveller, UK leisure trav eller, foreign business traveller and foreign leisure traveller, with each of these different types of traveller having a different value of time assigned to each type of passenger 63. The total time savings are then multip lied by the respective value of time to provide an overall financial value of the time saved for travelle rs in the far South West through the provision of services at Plymouth City Airport today. 7.65 We have assumed that, with the exception of those travelli ng to Bristol and London, pa ssengers who cannot fly from Pl ymouth will divert to use services from one of the other airports serving th e region, Bristol, Exeter or Newquay. For London and Bristol, displaced passeng ers are assumed to switch modes to make their journey by surface transport. 7.66 In Table 7.17 , we set out the value of journey time savings at 2030 for each of the runway extension options com pared to a scenario of no extension being provided (whether or not the RESAs are in place). This will tend to understate potential b enefits if the RESA works are not carried out because of the risks to achieving our 'no ex tension' passenger projections. 63 The values of time are taken from those used by the Department for Transport in the preparation of the Future of Air Transport White Paper, fact ored up to 2005 values and adjusted for future years taking into account estimates of future inflation and earnings growth. Plymouth City Airport Study 124 York Aviation LLP Comparison Short Runway Extension 1,690,000 780,000 40,000 30,000 Long Extension 7,790,000 BusinessTable 7.17: Additional Surface Journey Time Costs to Passengers Displaced with No Runway Extension (\u00a3), 2030 7.67 Table 7.17 illustrates that there are financial benef its to travellers should either the short or long runway extension is provided. In particular sizeable benefits accrue to UK business travelle rs both inbound and outbound to the City and to UK leisure travellers, some of whom will be new visitors to Plymouth. 7.68 We have also estimated the journey time savings benefits which Plymouth City Airport offers today. Currently the Airport provides journey time savings benefits to UK residents in excess of \u00a33 million per annum compared to the alternative journeys users w ould have to make if the Airport did not exist. By 2030, these journey time savings benefit s from retaining the Airport could rise to over \u00a340 million to UK residents as the Airport, if retained and able to grow within the confines of its existing runway, would continue to provide valuable links particularly to London. A major part of the user benefits from retaining Plymouth City Airport derive from the route to Gatwick both now and under any future scenario. With the benefits from retaining the Airport outweighing the incremental benefits of either of the extension options. 7.69 We go onto use these journey time sa vings as a measure of the value for money of public sector investment in the development of Plymouth City Airport in Section 11. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 125 Tourism 7.70 Ideally, we would also include a quantified assessm ent of the value of incremental tourist visits to Plymouth as a further measure of the value which the Airport brings to the local economy. However, there is inadequate data available from Airport, airline or t ourism authorities to enable a reasonable estimate of how many visitors to Plymouth by air today would not otherwise have visited in the absence of an air link. 7.71 Similarly, the tourism strategy fo r Plymouth is still u nder development and we are not aware that any projections or targets exist for incremental tourist visits in future to form a basis of a quantitative assessment of the potential role of the Airport in achieving any targets. 7.72 Clearly measures of connectivity and journey time savings could als o be indicators of the likelihood of the Air port contributing to additional tourism income to the sub-region. This is particularly the case for domestic short break markets, driven by improved c onnections to UK regional cities. However, the success of such strategies will be as much a function of the development of the Plymouth tourism product as of the Airport itself. For this reason, whilst it is important to restat e the important role which improved air services could play in t he development of City tourism to Plymouth, we have not attempted to quantify the impact. Conclusion 7.73 Our analysis would suggest that the Airport makes a material economic contribution to the economy of Plymout h today. This arises principally through three mechanisms: 4 direct, indirect and induced employment and income from the operation of the Airport and of Air Southwest amounting to a GVA to the sub- regional economy of some \u00a312.2 million; 4 the contribution to air servic e connectedness of Plymouth and the effect on the image of t he City as a place to do business and to visit; 4 the benefits to users, primarily through journey time savings, particularly on the route to London Gatwick. Plymouth City Airport Study 126 York Aviation LLP 7.74 As Plymouth strives to achieve the 'step change' in economic performance implied by realising the Vision, it will be important to lever the advantages which the Airport can offer. At the very least, in the circumstances where increasing employment and population levels are impo rtant to delivering the Vision, the direct, indirect and induced employment generat ed by the Airport will, of itself, be valuable. 7.75 Furthermore, loss of the Airport w ould clearly be dam aging to the image of Plymouth as a business centre. Notwithstanding the emphasis on endogenous growth, dependence of new business on air service access, not just to London but to other business centres in the UK and beyond is likely to increase over time. Whilst we cannot quantify the wider benefits from an expanding air service offe r, other than through the in cremental journey time savings and measures of connectivity, experience of other cities would suggest that the perception of connectedness may be as great an influence as the actual air service offer provided. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 127 8 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Key Points 4 Noise is the single most significant envir onmental issue at Plymouth City Airport. 4 In overall terms, noise levels at the Airport are not out of line with the impact of other regional airports in terms of the scale of the Leq contour or the number of people affected. 4 However, there are major issues with individual events generating high levels of noise, particularly early morning engine testing and helicopter operations. Flying training involving circuits of the airfield also give rise to significant community annoyance. 4 Growth of commercial traffic at the Airport will give rise to increased noise impacts but this is unlikely to give rise to significant local concerns so long as there is a trade off in terms of reductions in the noi sy single events giving rise to high levels of annoyance. 4 Although there are other environmental impacts arising from the Airport's operation, none give rise to significant concerns. 4 The construction of the embankment to provide the eastern RESA and runway extension would need to be subject to a full environmental impact assessment. 8.1 Within this section of the Report, we consider the current environmental impact of the Airport on the surroundi ng ar ea and the issues arising from this. For the purpose of this report we have considered impacts under the following headings: 4 Noise; 4 Air quality; 4 Ecology; 4 Landscape and Visual; ment and Drainage; 4 Water Environ4 Flood Risk; n; 4 Ground Contaminatio 4 Cultural Heritage. Plymouth City Airport Study 128 York Aviation LLP 8.2 It is important to note that some of these impacts and issues are not significant or greatly affected by any of the potential airport development scenarios. Consequently, this section of the report focuses primarily upon the noise impact of the airport which is a major area of concern, whilst the wider environmental baseline issues are discussed in Appendix C . Noise Background 8.3 In this section, the existing noise env ironment in proximity to the Airport is considered. Noise issues associated with the operation of Plymouth Airport have been identified as an area of concern by t he Council, including in workshops undertaken as part of the Local Transport Plan preparation and through the number of complaints received regarding aspects of the operation; notably early morning engine testing, helicopter operations and flying training circuits, culminating in a case to the Local Government Ombudsman. 8.4 Noise has historically been the most significant lo cal environme ntal issue at airports. The focus has often been main ly on night-time fli ght operations at most airports. However, there also ex ists the potential fo r noise disturbance from ground operations and maintenance activity. 8.5 Unlike the majority of small local ai rports, Plymouth City Ai rport is located in a densely populated area, largely as new housing has been developed around the airport site as the City had grown. As a result, the number of receptors that have the potential to be exposed to nois e disturbances due to airport operations is notably higher than those airports located outside of urban or sub-urban zones. This needs to be set in context, however, as the length of the runway limits the type and size of airc raft that can operate from the Airport to those gener ally with lower noise levels. The principal exceptions are military he licopter operations. Generally, with the exception of early morning engine te sting, current commercial aircraft operations give rise to little complaint. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 129 8.6 Key noise receptors in the vicinity of the Airport include residential properties to the north west along Tavistock Road, which is close to runway 06/24, the engine test bay and maintenance and terminal buildings. Residential properties are also located to the east and south of runway 13/31, off Plymbridge Road and Miller Way respectively. Basis of Assessment 8.7 At the outset, it must be borne in mind that aircraft noise is exempt from the Environmental Protec tion Act 1990. The Civil Aviation Act 1982 provides that no action for trespass or nuisance can be taken as long as an aircraft observes the rules of the Air and Air Traffic Control Regulations, which also cover ground movements. However, loca l authorities have a duty to regulate aircraft noise associated with airport operations (e.g. operating hours and engine testing). At Plymouth City Airp ort, controls are in place through planning conditions and through operating c onditions attached to the existing lease. Enforcement of these controls is a key concern to local residents and the need for improvements to the oper ating conditions and enforcement mechanisms is the subject of separate discussions between Sutton Harbour Holdings and the City Council. 8.8 Assessment of noise impacts primarily involves the identification of potential sensitive receptors, including resi denc es, educational establishments and hospitals. It also includes the identific ation of existing noise and vibration sources, together with cons ideration of the relevant national legislation and local planning issues. For the purpose of this report, our noise appraisal has drawn upon discussion with officers of Plymouth City Counci l and the airport operators. The following documents and sources were also reviewed: 4 City of Plymouth Local Transport Plan 2001 to 2006; 4 The Future of Air Transport Whit e Paper and supporting Consultation Documents; 4 Assessment of Noise and Air Quality.

Control of Aircraft Noise 8.9 Noise from airports can be categoris ed as being du e to either groundside or airside operations. Most airport noise pollution problems are concerned with airside operations in general and ta ke-off and landing operations in particular. Take-off commences with engines running at or near maximum thrust before brakes are released. Ther e is a steep initial climb with landing gear being retracted, after which ther e is a less steep climb with engines throttled back to reduce noise emission. Aircraft are required to adhere to specific minimum noise routes, avoiding areas of population, as they climb to cruising altitude. Since take-off noise exposure depends upon aircraft weight, a large part of which is aviati on fuel, some airports operate maximum take-off weight limitations on airlines. A critical issue at Plymouth is the adherence to these flight paths and procedures by military aircraft, particularly helicopter traffic. 8.10 Landing is generally a far less noise gen erating activit y. Airports generally operate a defined 3\u00b0 glide-sl ope, with landing aids to assist aircraft to maintain height and alignment. Gener ally, on landing, noise is influenced more by air disturbance around the fuselage, particularly once the undercarriage is lowered, than aircraft engine noise, which is lower on more modern aircraft. However, when t he line of approach needs correcting, the use of engine thrust can produce high sound levels at the ground. Most airports discourage, sometimes with fi nancial penalties, the use of reverse- thrust braking once the aircraft touches the runway; particularly at night. Again aircraft are required to adhere to specific minimum noise routes of preferred noise routes on thei r approach to the glide-slope. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 131 8.11 In general, normal commercial operations at Plymouth by fixed wing aircraft give rise to little conc ern, notwiths tanding the density of population around the Airport. 8.12 Ground side operations with the potent ial for noise generation include: 4 engine testing; 4 the use of auxiliary power units; 4 movement of ground equipment; and 4 passenger road traffic. 8.13 Following the recommendat ions of the Wilson Committee report on noise in 1963, the descriptor used for predicting and monitoring aircraft noise was the Noise and Number Index, NNI, which is based upon the Perceived Noise Level, (PNdB), of an aircraft type; and the number of that type operating into and out of the airport. Department of the Environment Circular 10/73, Planning and Noise (replaced by PPG24 above) recommended planning refusal for developments of dwellings where exposures reached 60 NNI or more and restrictive planning conditions for 40 to 59 NNI. 8.14 The United Kingdom Aircraft Noise I ndex Study (ANIS) , undertaken in 1982, was published by the Directorate of Rese arch of the Civil Aviation Authority in 1985 as DR8402 United Ki ngdom Aircraft Noise Index Study. The survey found that L Aeq,24h had a better correlation th an NNI with perceived annoyance/disturbance. In 1986, the D epartment of Transport undertook a consultative exercise resulting in the publication of the DORA Report 902364. 8.15 However, it was felt that L Aeq,24h was too radical a ch ange from the 12-hour basis of NNI and therefor e the following indices we re proposed as the basis for monitoring the noise impact of airport operations: 4 L Aeq,16h for 07:00 to 23:00 (day); 4 L Aeq,8h for 23:00 to 07:00 (night). 64 DORA Report 9023, The use of Leq as an Aircraft Noise Index , 1990, Civil Aviation Authority Plymouth City Airport Study 132 York Aviation LLP 8.16 These periods align wit h those of PPG24. The L eq dB(A) averages the sound energy monitored from all aircraft noise events in a certain area over a 16 hour period each day (0700 and 2 300). These have been evaluated as follows - Low Community Annoyance is registered at 57 L eq, Medium Annoyance at 63 L eq and High Annoyance at 69 L eq. 8.17 Recent World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines for dwellin gs suggest internal noise levels by day of 35dB(A) L Aeq,16hr and 30dB(A) L Aeq,8hr in bedrooms during the night time (2300 - 07 00). WHO also suggest amenity area (gardens & public spac es) guideline values for annoyance of 50 and 55 dB(A), representing daytime levels below which a majority of the adult population will be prot ected from becomi ng moderately or seriously annoyed, respectively. 8.18 In practice, noise restrictions at designated airports have been im plemented through restrictions on departing aircraft noi se, controls on night flying (under Section 79 of EPA 90) and housing noise insulation schemes. 8.19 At other airports, local resolution has been achieved using Section 106 Agreement, a agreement entered into with the approval of planning permission. Such obligations have been used to limit movement numbers, operating hours and the types of permitted aircraft. Voluntary agreements have also be reached at some air ports. London City Airport and Luton Airport, for example, have agreed ma ximum noise exposure contours, which must not be exceeded. 8.20 The existing operating restrictions at Plymouth City Air port need to be seen in context with what is the norm else where. To provide a context for considering the noise impact of devel opment at Plymouth City Airport, we have summarised noise control polices at other UK airports in Appendix B . 8.21 Under the International Civil Aviati on Organization (ICAO) Convention, aircraft are categorised by Chapters, as illustrated in Table 8.1. Noise emissions from aircraft ar e controlled as part of t he certification procedure which new aircraft types must undergo in order to be permitted to go into service.

A continuous monitor is located at the rear of properties on Tavistock Road, followi ng recurrent nuisance complaints associated with engine test ing, night-time operations and helicopter impacts. 8.23 The Airport generally receives commerc ial turboprop aircraft (Dash 8 aircraft operated by Air Southwest and ATR42 ai rcraft operated by Air Wales). In addition, the Airport is us ed by li ght aircraft operated by trainee Navy officers, FOST and Coastguard helicop ters, transplant flights and Plymouth Flying School. 8.24 The major issues associated with the si te in terms of noise were described by officers of Plymouth City Council as: 4 Engine testing early in the morning; 4 Flights arriving after 22:30; 4 Light aircraft touch and go operations and; 4 Airborne and ground helic opter operations (inclu ding police and military helicopters). Plymouth City Airport Study 134 York Aviation LLP 8.25 A Noise Assessment and Monitori ng Report was commissioned by the Council (Wimtec, 1998). The report concludes that \"approximately 700 dwellings\" are located within the 57 dB cont our for daytime exposure due to airborne aircraft (including helicopters and general aviation) , i.e. above the Low Community Annoyance threshold. This conclusion was based on the aircraft noise prediction modelling of ex isting aircraft movements. However, an earlier statement within the Wimtec report suggests that \"existing daytime noise exposure at Plymouth City Airport may be around 55dBL Aeq(16 hour) at the nearest residential properties...\" , based on measured data. The 57 Laeq(16hour) from the Wimtec Report is shown in Figure 8.1. Figure 8.1: Low Community Annoyance Noise Contour from Airborne Noise for Plymouth Airport 1997 Source: Wimtec Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 135 8.26 More recently, the Consultation Document covering the South West of England issued by the DfT prior to t he publication of the Future of Air Transport White Paper indicated that some 1,400 people were resident within the 'low annoyance contour. Whils t this is a higher number than affected by aircraft noise at other airpor ts in the South West of England, it is still relatively low compared to airpor ts elsewhere. We highlight some comparator airports in Table 8.2. Table 8.2: Populati on Affected by Aircraft Noise (57 dBA Contour) at Selected UK Airports 1999 1999 Reference Case 2030 Plymouth 1,400 2,400 Bournemouth 900 5,700 Bristol 1,000 2,000 Exeter 0 700 Newquay 0 0 Belfast City 4,100 13,700 Belfast International 600 900 Aberdeen 9,900 11,500 Edinburgh 4,400 4,200 Glasgow 25,000 41,900 Prestwick 3,600 300 Humberside 0 0 Leeds Bradford 8,700 19.900 Liverpool 2,600 8,800 Newcastle 1,200 4,700 Department for Transport 8.27 In terms of the overall noise impact of airports, Pl ymouth City Airport is not a significantly greater generator of annoy ance from airborne noise. It should be noted that subsequent work for SWRDA on an airport strategy for the Far South West65 indicated the future population exposed to low annoyance from noise could rise to some 4,900 people, this is still signific antly less than the number exposed at Belfast City Airpor t for example. Production of new noise contours is beyond the scope of th is Report but t hese would need to be prepared to accompany any planning application for an extended runway. We go onto discuss the issues raised in general terms below. 65 Development of an Air Transport Strategy for the Far South West, Aviasolutions 2003 Plymouth City Airport Study 136 York Aviation LLP 8.28 The noisiest operations are the application of revers e thrust during landings. These operations are included in the ai rborne aircraft assessment provided within the Wimtec report. However, the Wimtec Report does not include an assessment of the potential noise im pact of ground operations, including: 4 taxiing; 4 engine running on the terminal apron; 4 manoeuvring on the apron and taxiways; 4 reverse thrust braking; 4 auxiliary power units; 4 ground power units; 4 ground support vehicles; 4 engine testing. Discussions with the Council would suggest that the majority of annoyance is associated with ground based activity , often the noise associated with a single event rather than average noise levels due to airborne commercial aircraft operations. 8.29 Engine testing of DHC-8 aircraft, typi cally in the early morning, wit hin the 2- sided engine test bay, was reported to generate noise leve ls of 75-91 dB LAmax at the rear of property gardens on Tavistock Road. This exceeds noise levels of 60-65 dB L Amax used to restrict nuisance impacts at other major UK city and international airports. A critical issue is the provision of additional screening to the engine test area to achieve at least 10 dB noise attenuations. The timing of such engine testing is also cr itical as it is an integral part of the Air Southwest operation to ensure availability of all its aircraft fleet, maintained at Plymouth, to sustain the integrity of t he airline's total operation. 8.30 Aircraft taxiing manoeuvres are additi onal sources of noise at airports. Though maximum noise levels are considerably lower than take-off and landing and engine testing activities, such noise levels can impact if in proximity to receptors. This is an issue at Plymouth, particularly with operations on runway 06/24 Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 137 8.31 Military aircraft present a different so rt of problem, insofar as they are exempted from all c ontrols under Crown Immunity. Flying training operations on behalf of t he military and helicopter operations are a major source of annoyance at Plymouth. T he potential for impact can be mitigated by air traffic control management measures but it is not cl ear the extent to which such measures are being enforced at Plymouth. Assessment of Effects on the Proposed Development on Noise 8.32 Our assessment above would suggest t hat the major source of annoyance at Plymouth Airport relates to ground operat ions and/or military and flying training operations. It is important to recognise that the growth scenarios which are considered in this Report relate fundamentally to an increase in commercial flying. The scenarios cons idered do not assume that military and flying training operat ions will increase over time. Indeed such operations may decrease in the medium to long term if the airport operator give priority to commercial scheduled operations. 8.33 In Section 6, we set out possi ble growth scenarios, including the redevelopment of the Air port by extending the runway and/or RESAs, closing runway 06/24, rearranging the existing la yout of facilities and constructing a mixed use commercial/residential development. Such development has the potential to impact on the local noise environment in a number of ways: 4 increased numbers of aircraft arriva ls and departures will increase the number of flight noise events at the airport and on its approach routes; 4 increased runway length will allow a change in aircraft type and size. These aircraft may have differing noise profiles to existing aircraft accessing the Airport (see below); 4 increased passenger traffic will increas e road traffic and hence potential noise impacts on approach roads; 4 the introduction of residential properties as part of the development has the potential to increase the number of noise sensitive receptors in proximity to the airport; Plymouth City Airport Study 138 York Aviation LLP 4 changes in airport layout may require the movement of existing noisy activities such as power units, support vehicles, engine running and apron manoeuvring, closer to or furt her from sensitive receptors; 4 closure of runway 06/24 will have t he effect or removing one source of noise nuisance from the residents on Tavistock Road; 4 new buildings could be located so as to provide partial noise screening for sensitive receptors. 8.34 The effects of any proposed developm ent on the local noise env ironment are summarised in Table 8.3. Other Impacts 8.35 In Appendix C, we have set out the environment al impacts both in the base line and in relation to the impact of development. The impacts are summarised in Table 8.4 . In general terms, whilst the Airport does give rise to a range of environmental impacts, thes e are generally less significant than the current and potential noise effects. As with noise impacts, any planning application for development would need to be accompanied by a full environmental impact assessment. Plymouth City Airport Study Table 8.3: Review of Potent ial Noise Impacts of Proposed Airport Expansion Options Effect Development Option Potential Impact and Proposed Mitigation No Runway Extension There is the potential for a maximum increase in daily flights from 11 to 31. This represents a 280% increase. As aircraft will be restricted to the existing Dash 8 Q300 type, t he noise generation can be predicted by proportionality. At the maximum 31 flights per day, the daytime noise levels due to airborne aircraft would increa se by up to 5dB(A). This has the potential to include many more local residential properties within the Low Community Annoyance contour. As a trade-off for increasing passenger aircraft movements at the Airport, it may be possible to reduce or stop some light aircraft training operations. Tr aining touch-and-go operations have poten cy for causing greater annoyance at a given noise level, due to public opinion regarding necessity. The repetitive nature of these activities generally causes greater annoyance than scheduled flights. Increased numbers of aircraft arrivals and departures Short Runway Extension The number of aircraft arrivals and departures will depen d on whether the passenger demand is low (28 flights), medium (40 flights) or high (48 flights). These am ount to increases of 250%, 360% and 440% flights per day, respectively, against the current flight schedule. Only by re -modelling of the airborne aircra ft noise could the extent of potential impacts be quantified, as this will depend on aircraft type and respective numbers. This quantitative assessment lies outside of the scope of this report. Increasing the apron area for aircraft parking at the north of runway 06/24 will introduce additional aircraft manoeuvring noises in closer proximity to resi dential properties on Tavistock Road.

These include noise and vibration suppression systems and new gener ation turbofans. From January 2006 all new aircraft will be required to meet the more stringent requirements of ICAO Chapter 4 noi se regulations. These regulations are approximately 10dB more stringent than the Chapter 3 standar d. At present all civil passenger ai rcraft operating from Plymouth Airport meet Chapter 4 noise regulations. An example of improving technologies is the 3dB reduction from Dash 8 Q300 to the Dash 8 Q400 on take-off, sideline and approach. Supporting information regarding the reduction in aircraft noise is presented at the end of this chapter. A detailed noise contour modelling assessment should be und ertaken to determine future airborne aircraft impacts due to the potential variations in aircraft and flight characteristics. Th is quantitative assessment lie s outside of the scope of this report. No Runway Extension Any increase in flights would lead to a proportionate increase in vehicles accessing the airport. However, it is unlikely that the increase (likely to be less than 1000 vehicles per day) would present a significant impact due to the airports location off already busy local roads. This increase woul d have to represent an 80% increase in traffic volume on local roads to be for the perceptible by receptors along those routes. Increased passenger traffic leading to increased local road traffic Short Runway Extension Based on the change in aircraft type, the increase in airp ort generated traffic for the low, medium and high passenger forecasts will be approximately +340%, +480% and +580%. This represents an increase in vehicle noise contribution to the local environment along affected routes in the order of +5dB, +7dB and +8dB respectively. This does not take into account non-airport road traffic noise.

This quantitative assessment lies outside of the scope of this report. The introduction of additional sensitive receptors No Runway Extension Unlikely to be applicable, unless some airport land was redeveloped, then the impact and mitigation would be as below. 142 York Aviation LLP Plymouth City Airport Study Effect Development Option Potential Impact and Proposed Mitigation The introduction of additional sensitive receptors cont'd Short and Long Runway Extensions, and Long Runway with Closure of Newquay The proposed 'mixed use development' site is a minimum of 220m from Runway 13/31, which is further than existing properties on Tavistock Road, Plymbridge Road and off Miller Way. Appropriate sound insulation and design of any proposed sensitive buildings should adequately control noise intrusion from aircraft approach, sideline and take-off operations on runway 31/13. However, the introduction of additional potentially noise se nsitive receptors associated with a mixed use development on the western end of runway 06/24 has the potential for ma jor noise impact associated with the operation of the engine test bay, both at its existing location or the proposed location illustrated in drawing PLH Option A. A mixed use development will introduce as yet undetermined sensitive recept ors in proximity to the sites major noise source. These receptors will require protection from noise disturbance The degree of noise attenuation will be dependent on the sensitivity of the receptors and the pr oposed airport activity. Currently engine testing operations lead to L Amax levels of 75-91dB at the rear garden of the neare st residential properties (200m away). Residential accommodation (C1, C2, C3 etc) would be the most sensitive re ceptors, particularly to noise generated between 10pm and 7 am. Business accommodation (B1) would also be susceptible to loud noise impacts during normal business Any application would need to demonstrate that mitigation of the impacts of existing and proposed site operations would not give rise to nuisance particularly if operational hours for engine testing are to continue between 22:30 and 07:00. This would likely require noise measurements and mo delling with design mitigation in place. However, the building design and the mitigat ion required lies outside of the scope of th is report.. Appropriately designed B2/B8 buildings could be used as noise screens for the major noise generating activities to provide mitigation for existing residents and more sensitive receptors associat ed with the proposed mixed use development. However, given existing historical nuisance associated with noisy activities and in particular the unsociable hours of those activities it would be highly likely that planning per mission would likely be opposed by Environmental Health at the Council for the location of additional noise sensitive re ceptors in proximity to an engine testing facility, with or without mitigation in place, particularly one operating regularly and in unsocial hours. York Aviation LLP 143 Plymouth City Airport Study Effect Development Option Potential Impact and Proposed Mitigation No Runway tension ExAn assessment of potential sound mitigation measures sh ould be undertaken in order to minimise existing noise impacts from the operation of the engine test bay. Operation and relocation of noisy activities Short and Long Runway Extensions, and Long Runway with Closure of Newquay A number of options have been considered for the relocation of ai rport infrastructure in order to release Airport land to the west site for lease or sale for 'mixed use development'. The most significant operations to be relocated will be the main airport hangar and the engine test bay. The proposal also seeks an increase in the apron areas, between runway 06/24 and Tavistock Road. Historically, engine testing opera tions have been the subject of many noise complaints from local residents, especially thos e properties on Tavistock Road. This is due to existing planning conditions in regard of hours of operation which allows early morning te sting (from 5:30am) prior to the first flights of the day. Typically, at other UK airports engine testing is restricted. The majority of UK airports have Section 106 agreements with their Local Authority restricting engine testing to daytime hours only (07:00 to 23:00). Some larger airports, such as Manchester, have specified a target to keep night ti me engine testing to an absolute minimum, monitoring operations as part of a noise management strategy. Even at airports with no formal policy on noise, such as Exeter and Bristol, informal controls on noise are adopted which restrict noisy operations after 11pm and before 6.30 am, sometimes even later, and often restrictions on the number of such noisy activities during each month. Except ions are made in emergencies or for occasional commercial reasons. Noise limits at sensitive receptors are used to reduce the potential for nuisance disturbance. Mitigation of the impacts of the Engine Test Bay in its ex isting position would deem as providing an improvement and would not require planning permission. However, the E ngine Test Bay even with greatly enhanced mitigation would likely be deemed a potential noise nuisance due to its regular use, its existing hours of operation (between 22:30 and 07:00) and its closer proximity to existing noise complainants. The proposed relocation of airport facilit ies, such as the Engine Test Bay, as illustrated in drawing PLH Option A., would require a new planning application. As part of any chang es to the existing site lay out as part of the proposed development will require careful design in terms of noise management. Mitigation measures including appropriately designed B2/B8 type buildings could be used as noise scre ens for the major noise generating activities to provide 144 York Aviation LLP Plymouth City Airport Study mitigation for existing residents and potential sensitive rec eptors associated with the prop osed mixed use development. However, the building design and the mitigation prov ided lies outside of the scope of this report. Given existing historical noise impacts as sociated with noisy activities and in particular the unsociable hours of those activities it would be highly likely that any planning applic ation for moving the Engine Test Bay would be opposed by Environmental Health at the Council Success of an application in light of previous experience would undoubtedly rest upon far more stringent environmental obligations as part of a Section 106 Agreement under the Town and Country Planning Act. In addition, a detailed environmental noise assessment would need to be conducted to demonstrate that off-site noise limits would not be exceeded. This would need to include propo sals for mitigation design where appropriate.

Source: Faber Maunsell York Aviation LLP 149 Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 151 Conclusions 8.36 It is clear that the most significant environmental impa ct of Plymouth City Airport is noise nuisance. However, th is needs to be set in context as the number of residents affected by noise from airborne o perations is relatively small despite the high density of popul ation adjacent to the Airport. No residents are affected by higher comm unity annoyance levels from airborne operations but it has to be acknow ledged that the num ber of residents affected at the lower annoyance threshol d is relatively high when considered against the relatively low level of commercial activity at the Airport today. 8.37 Whilst growth of commercial traffic at the Airport will in crease the numbers of people affected by noise, the abs olute numbe r is still likely to be low relative to other airports in urban locations. This will need to be confirmed by detailed modelling work. 8.38 The significant issues relate to single noise events, mostly on the ground. These are associated with, mainly, m ilitary helic opter oper ations and ground running of aircraft engines, particula rly in the early morning hours. Appropriate mitigation measur es will need to be put in place to limit these nuisances. Flying training activity also gives rise to some nuisance. As commercial operations at the Airport increase and financial viability is secured, it may be possible to seek some limitation on these activities. Plymouth City Airport Study 152 York Aviation LLP9 SURFACE TRANSPORT IMPACT Key Points 4 The location of the Airport adjacent to Tavistock Road and the Derriford area means that access routes to and from it are often congested during peak periods. 4 The Airport itself severs access between Tavistock Road and the Derriford Hospital area. 4 Generally peak activity at the Airport falls outside these peak hours. 4 Public transport access to the Airport is poor. The opportunity to extend bus services to Derriford Hospital to serve the Airport should be explored. 4 Development in the Derriford area generally will place further pressure on road infrastructure, although the Airport itself is likely to be only a minor contributor, even as it grows. 4 There will be some issues connected with the construction of a runway extension in terms of lorries bringing in materials and severance of some roads and footpaths to the east. 4 face access strategy to accompany any planning application for development. We recommend that the Airport draws up a sur Scope of Assessment 9.1 This section considers the existing surface access to Plymouth City Airport and surface access issues for the Plymouth City Airport Master Plan and as an input to the LDF. Surface access includes access by road, access by public transport and access by pedestrians and cyclists. Future developments at the airport and propos ed transport schemes are discussed. Key potential surface access issues for Plymouth City Airport include: 4 4 4 traffic during construction of any new facilities at the airport; the impact of land take for any new airport facilities on existing transport infrastructure; and improvement of surface access to the air port to deal with increased passenger numbers and vehicle parking. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 153 9.2 The assessment presented here is based on desk study, a site walkover and discussions with the airport operator and local authority. Further detailed work would be required as par t of any planning application. Desk Sources 9.3 The following documents and sources have been reviewed: 4 City of Plymouth Local Transport Plan 2001 to 2006; 4 City of Plymouth Provisional Local Transport Plan 2006 to 2011; 4 Local Development Framework Ar ea Action Plan for Derriford/Seaton and Southway; 4 Plymouth Local Plan, First Deposit Plan, 1995 to 2011; 4 Plymouth City Council, Plymouth City Airport Study, Comments on Interim Report of October 2005; 4 Derriford and Southway Area Planning Framework, Draft Final Report, April 2005, Llewelyn Davies; 4 Sustrans (the sustainable transport charity which supports the development of tr ansport routes); and 4 Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 Explorer Mapping. 9.4 We have based our analysis of the surface acces s issues at Plymouth Airport on the scenarios and passenger forecasts as set out in Table 5.4. These forecast strong growth potential at the Airport, albeit from a low base, as new routes and services are brought on stream. 9.5 In terms of surface access traffic t he peak flows to and from the A irport are likely to be related to: Plymouth City Airport Study 154 York Aviation LLP4 the arrival and departure times of incoming and outgoing flights - for incoming flights passengers are likely to depart the airport within 30 minutes of arrival. For outgoing fli ghts passenger traffic will be affected by check-in times but typically passengers will arrive between 45 minutes and 1 hour 30 minutes before departure time. 4 the interval between f lights - where these are close together peak flows are likely to be higher. 4 aircraft size - with the runway extension, the largest aircraft at Plymouth City Airport will be the 98-106 seat Embraer 190 although many flights will use smaller aircraft. These aircraft are smaller than the variants of the B oeing 737 (700 Series has 120-149 seats) and Airbus A319 (126-142 seats) typically used by low cost airlines within Europe. As a result the passenger traffic flows associated with individual flights will be smaller than at airports handling these larger aircraft. Existing Surface Access to Plymouth City Airport 9.6 Plymouth City Airport is located on the key transpor t corridor running to the north from Plymouth city centre, t he A386 Tavistock Road which provides access to key residential and employ ment areas including Derriford, Seaton and Southway. The Airport is a signi ficant economic asset to the city, providing fast and convenient air links between Plymouth and major destinations in the UK and Eire. 9.7 The recent development of Plymout h International M edical and Technology Park and the expansion of Derriford Ho spital and associated medical cluster have significantly changed the charac ter of the area surrounding Plymouth City Airport. In addition, the College of St Mark and St John (also called Marjon) is within the immediate area. 9.8 Plymouth City Airport, Derriford Hospit al and the College of St M ark and St John, combine to form an important em ployment centre within the city. However they generate substantial tr affic, which has seen the A386 Tavistock Road transport corridor operating at or near capacity, particularly in the peak hours. Traffic forecasts predi ct further traffic growth from these activities without taking into account growth at the Airport. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 155 9.9 The Local Development Framework Area Action Plan for Derriford/Seaton and Southway identifies t he following key issues which are relevant to surface access to Plymouth City Airport: 4 how to reduce congestion on the A386 Tavistock Road caused by commuters to Derriford and the City Centre; and 4 how to promote the Airport as an important arrival point and means of transport for the City. 9.10 In terms of local access by all modes the airport footprint itself severs access to the Airport Terminal from the nor th west, north and north east. We highlight the key surface access issues in Figure 9.1. Figure 9.1: Key Surface Access I ssues at Plymouth City Airport Source: Faber Maunsell Plymouth City Airport Study 156 York Aviation LLPRoutes for Pedestrians and Cyclists 9.11 Plymouth City Airport is served by a number of routes for pedestrians and cyclists. 9.12 The Sustrans interactive National C ycle Network and the Plymout h Strategic Cycle Network Map show a designated segregated cycle route running along the west side of the A386, Tavistock Road to Derriford Roundabout. The cycle route continues for circa 300m alon g Derriford Road to the junction with Plymbridge Lane. A further cycle r oute follows Charlton Road between Tavistock Road and Seaton Barracks. The National Cycle Network for the area of north Plymouth is also shown in Figure 9.1. 9.13 The main dedicated pedestrian routes are shown on the same plan. In addition all main roads and mos t other roads in the area have pedestrian footways. 9.14 Key local routes for walking and cycling are: 4 the footpath between t he College of St Mark and St John and bus stop off Plymbridge Lane shown in Figure 9.2 is also convenient for airport users. It is circa 500m from t he airport terminal to the bus stop; 4 from the immediate areas of Derriford and Thornbury accessing Derriford Hospital, College of St. Ma rk and St. John, Derriford Leisure Centre situated along Derriford Road, and Plymouth City Airport (used by local residents and staff); and 4 the Plymouth City Cross Link, a des ignated recreational path (used for both travel to work, for recr eation and for other purposes). Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 157 Figure 9.2: Footpath serving the Ai rport and the College of St Mark and St John Source: Faber Maunsell 9.15 Plymouth City Cross Link passes to t he south of Derriford Hospital. The route crosses the north part of Plymouth along Budshead Creek and joins the B3373. At the junction with the A386 Tavistock Road it turns north and follows the east side of Tavistock R oad to Derriford roundabout. The route continues east along a designated pedestr ian and cyclist route to Bircham Valley Nature Reserve. The route t hen joins Blunt Lane and turns south to Leigham where it joins the West Devon Way. Plymouth City Airport Study 158 York Aviation LLP9.16 There is a high standard footpath immediately to the south east of the end of the airport runway 13/31 as shown in Figure 9.3 . This path runs just outside the existing airport boundary and parallel to the boundary fence. The path has a tarmacadam surface and street lighting and connects Miller Way, Derriford to the Estover Industrial Estate on Plymbridge Road. This path will be severed by any runway extension an d, while diversion may be possible, this will involve longer travel distances for pedestrians. Although it does not appear as a designated cycle route, there may be some use by cyclists. This footpath is probably relatively unimportant for airport access but provides a convenient connection between the residential areas at Derriford and the Estover Industrial Estate. Figure 9.3: Footpath to Estover Industrial Estate at south east end of Runway 13/31 Source: Faber Maunsell 9.17 Based on the Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 mapping, there are no public rights of way in the immediate study area. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 159 9.18 In overall terms, there are some good quality routes for walkers and cyclists that serve the Airport but most foot and cycle trips requires the use of heavily trafficked roads, notably the A386 Tavistoc k Road. The airport footprint itself severs movement on foot and cycle from the north west, north and north east to and from the terminal area. Access by Road 9.19 Plymbridge Lane, shown in Figure 9.4, serves the Airport Terminal and other airport facilities. It connects with Derriford Road and thence, by way of a signal controlled roundabout wit h the A386 Tavistock Road. Figure 9.4: Plymbridge Lane look ing north east in the direction of the Airport Terminal Source: Faber Maunsell 9.20 Existing traffic flows along Tavist ock Road at Derriford Roundabout are given in Table 9.1. All traffic flows are two-way and based on average Monday to Friday, 0700 to 1900 data for October 2004. Plymouth City Airport Study 160 York Aviation LLP12 Hour FlowMean - 2011Table 9.1: Traffic flows (vehicles) on A386 Tavistock Road, October 2004 9.21 At peak hours congesti on is likely on Derriford Road, which serves both Derriford Hospital and residential areas , particularly at the junction between Derriford Road and the A386 Tavistock Road. Congestio n hotspots on the routes to and from the ai rport identified in the Pl ymouth Provisional Local Transport ) 2006-2011, are: 4 A38 Manadon Junction (A38/A386) - traffic queues on exit slips extend onto the A38 mainline, possibly due to congestion on Plymouth's local road network; 4 A386 Tavistock Road - volume of traffic at peak periods in particular at the George Junction and at Derrifo rd roundabout. The A386 Tavistock Road scheme to increase junction capacity and provide bus and pedestrian / cycle priority is expec ted to be completed in 2005/06. 9.22 The PPLTP 2006 to 2011 indicates that a high level of people working in Moor Views Ward commute to work by ca r. This may be as a result of the greater availability of staff parking fo r employees in the area, for example, the designated staff park and ride scheme at Derriford Hospital. 9.23 No formal traffic count has been undertake n at Plymouth City Airport to give an indication of existing traffic generati on. However, the busiest period for traffic movements is generally regarded by Plymouth City Airport as between 09.30 and 15.00 daily. 9.24 There is currently no provision made for the movement of freight through the airport and the need for access by heavy goods vehicles is limited to occasional service vehicles. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 161 Access by Public Transport 9.25 In common with most small regional airports, there is very limited access by puvlid transport. There is, in fact, curr ently no public transport direct to the airport terminal other than by taxi. Ta xi journeys take c.15 minutes to reach the city centre. However, both Derriford Hospital and the College of St Mark and St John are served by high frequency bus services to the city centre, railway station and other locations. These services serve the bus stop shown in Figure 9.5 , which is within 500 metres of the Terminal. It is likely that some trips to and from the air port, both staff and passengers, are by public transport. This is more likely for staff and for passengers without luggage. The local bus in ternet site directs pot ential passengers to bus stops on the A386 Tavistock Road at Derriford roundabout which is a 10 minute walk from the Airport. Bus services within Plymouth are provided by Plymouth City Bus Ltd and Fi rst Devon and Cornwall. Table 9.2 summarises the frequency of bus services along Tavistock Road and at Derriford Hospital.

If the service was not viable, a subsidy would be required although this might only be needed for a temporary period. 9.28 A shuttle service or Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) serving the Airport and linking to the nearest public trans port interchange is an alternative way of serving the Airport by public trans port. Again, this might not be commercially viable and a subsidy might be required.

Car parking could be extended and rearranged using the land currently rented to the College of St Mark and St John. This would offer the opportunity to rationalise pick up and drop off areas. To the extent that public transport to the Airport can be im proved, this woul d limit the need for additional car parking spaces. Plymouth City Airport Study 166 York Aviation LLP9.32 On the basis that current peak demand for public parking is circa 100 spaces (63% of the 158 available spaces) for less than 170,000 passengers, the number of spaces required for 1,244,000 passengers would be circa 730. 1 hectare of flat land is required for 400 sp aces, so the additi onal land required for car parking would be at least 1.5 hectares, assuming that there is no change in the modal split of travel to and from the Airport. It is noted that the existing hedge line along the south side of Plymbridge Lane is of high quality with a number of large mature trees (s ee Figures 9.2, 9.4 and 9.8). Hence, any rearrangement of the access will nee d to avoid significant impacts on this hedge line. Transport Schemes 9.33 Many of Plymouth's roads were built over 50 years ago and are r eaching the end of their design life. It is therefor e likely that some will need to be reconstructed over the coming years. This may be achieved in part during improvement schemes within the City. 9.34 Committed transport projects include: 4 Northern Corridor Major Public Transport Scheme - 450 space Park and Ride and High Quality Public Tr ansport Interchange (see below); 4 Bus Interchange Facility at Derriford Hospital - improved bus interchange facility within the Derri ford Hospital site, subject to progress with development at the Hospital under a PFI and the approval to the Derriford Masterplan; 4 Derriford Road/ Plymbridge Lane improvements - public transport and highway improvements to Derriford Road and the Derriford Road/Plymbridge Lane junction; 4 Northern Corridor Integrated Trans port - improved public transport priority at both Woolwell and Derriford roundabouts; 4 Improved Bus Facilities - bus boarder implementation and the provision of real time passenger information systems; and Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 167 4 Public Transport Improvement s through Urban Bus Challenge - Plymouth City Council have been succe ssful in securing funding for a project to improve access to employ ment opportunities on the Northern Corridor. 9.35 The key improvement scheme in the area is: 4 A386 Northern Corridor (Tavistock Road) - an 18 month scheme that commenced in May 2004 incorporat ing junction realignment and capacity improvements, pedestrian / cycle enhancements, bus priority and a new public transport interchange / park and ride site. 9.36 The George Park and Ride Scheme is part of this scheme and provides 450 parking spaces locat ed to the north of Plymouth City Ai rport between A386 Tavistock Road and B3432, Plymbridge Road. Figure 9.9 shows the George junction with the park and ride and public transport interchange under construction in October 2005. The site will act as a major transport hub, enabling interchange betwe en bus, private car, cycle and walk modes. The 'Derriford and Southway Area Plan ning Framework, Draft Final Report, April 2005' assumed that 15% of t he through traffic on the A386 would use the Park and Ride. This figure is c onsistent with the assumption adopted by Plymouth City Council. 9.37 A further transport scheme to enhanc e access to the public transport network is the 'Kickstart' project, a scheme to enhance the service 80/81 bus corridor between sout h east Cornwall an d Derriford Hospital via Plymouth city centre. Plymouth City Airport Study 168 York Aviation LLPFigure 9.9: George Park and Ride Scheme nearing completion in October 2005 Source: Faber Maunsell Future Development in the Area 9.38 The Derriford/Airport Employment Ar ea is an established employment area. Some of the land is used solely fo r employment purposes while a similar amount is mixed use. The proposed ex pansion of Derriford Hospital and proposals to create a new mixed-use district centre with land developed for retail and offices premises will significantly increas e the employment density of the area. 9.39 The Derriford and Southway Devel opment Framework Draft Final Report April 2005 identified a num ber of preferred develop ment options, including residential and mixed-use development at Plymouth City Airport, Southway, Derriford Hospital, Plymouth Inter national Business Park/Planned Care Centre and Forder Valley. The Framework consider ed the impact of each development option on transportation an d surface access, concentrating on enhancing movement and connectiv ity within the area. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 169 9.40 This increased intensity of developm ent within the A386 co rridor is likely to see increased traffic flows in the area. The proposed development of the land partly occupied by runway 06/24 provides a opportunity to improve the links between Derriford/Southway and the A386 to the north. The Derriford and Southway Development Framework Draft Final Report April 2005 suggested that, with the cl osure of runway 06/24, a new access road could be provided to connect Tavistock R oad and Plymbridge Lane. This would link with the College of St Mark and St John via the existing airport access road. Connection to Derriford road could be provided by upgrading the existing private road adjacent to the Un iversity College to a two-way public highway. This additional road link would provide some relief to Tavistock Road by taking hospital, college and airpor t traffic to and from the north of Plymouth off Tavistock Road. 9.41 The additional highway connection between A386 Tavistock Road and Derriford Road would enable bus priority measures to be implemented, and provide an improved connection betw een the Derriford Hospital public transport interchange and the Park and Ride at the George junction. 9.42 However the road link would cut in to the potential land for development, reducing its value. In addi tion, this would force the relocation of many of the airport facilities wh ich would be exp ensive and most probably unviable as discussed in Section 6 of this Report. Plymouth City Airport Study 170 York Aviation LLPKey Surface Access Issues for th e Plymouth City Airport Master Plan Traffic during Construction. 9.43 It has been estimated that 650,000 tonnes of fill wi ll be required to extend the runway to the longest scheme. If this is sourced from within the airport boundary or local vicinity, the wider tr affic impact will be minimal although the noise from on-site construction may be an issue. If all of the fill material needs to be imported the traffic flow will be some 32,500 four axle rigid tipper lorries on the assumption that each lo rry's payload is 20 tonnes. The total number of lorry movements will be 65,000. Assuming a one year construction period and seven day work ing this equates to 65,000 divided by 365 equals 200 movements per day. The r oad network in the area is likely to be able to handles these movements but it would be preferable if they could be avoided. If they are unavoid able careful consideration should be given to minimising environmental impacts by careful routing of construction traffic. Land take 9.44 The path connecting Miller Way, Derriford to the Estover Industrial Estate on Plymbridge Road would be s evered by any runway extension and, while diversion may be possible, this will involve longer travel distances for pedestrians. An alternative route, wh ich may be suitable as a temporary route during construction, is available through the housing estate and the Estover Industrial Estate. However, a more direct route needs to be sought for the permanent diversion. 9.45 Bus Service 147 which serves Thor nbury Road and Es tover Industrial Estate from Plymbridge Road will be affected by the runway extension. The loop around Thornbury Road would no longer be possible. The bus service connects to the city centre and Derriford Hospital running at a 30 minute frequency during peak hours between Monda ys and Saturdays. No other services are affected. Further consi deration will need to be given to the effect of this on user s of the bus service. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 171 Operation 9.46 Extension of the runway and an a ssumed increase in flight frequency and flight destinations at Plymouth City Air port could potential see an increase in passengers from 110,000 (assumed existing levels) to 589,000 by 2010, and 1,244,000 by 2030. This is the equivalent to a 250% increase and a 630% increase respectively. As a traffic gener ator, the Airport is currently modest in comparison to the adjoining Derriford Hospital. Plymouth Hospitals NHS website currently indicates that: 4 there are 760 public parking spaces at Derriford Hospital; 4 25,000 people pass through the front doors of the main Plymouth Hospitals each week (an average of 3,571 per day); 4 at least 25,000 vehicles enter the De rriford Hospital site per week (an average of 3,571 per day). 9.47 It is possible that with the highest fo recast passenger numbers at Plymouth City Airport, the number of car parking spaces required at the Airport could approach the existing number at Derrifo rd Hospital. However, with lower turnover of parking spaces at the Airport, trip generatio n is likely to be lower than the trip generation from the Hospital as existi ng. Even with the high passenger growth figures, Plymouth City Airport passenger numbers will remain modest compared to othe r airports. For example: 4 Bristol Airport handled 4.64 million passengers in 2004; 4 Southampton Airport handled 1.53 million passengers in 2004; 4 Exeter Airport handled more than 500,000 passengers in the period April to September 2005. 9.48 However, in the absence of measures to minimise trip generation by motor vehicles, there will be some additiona l pressure on surface access to the Airport. This could increase congesti on on the A386 Tavistock Road, with particular problems at the junctions serving the Derriford area. Additional work is required to assess the extent of these problems and how they could be addressed. Plymouth City Airport Study 172 York Aviation LLP9.49 It would be desirable to improve public transport facilities as this will both improve the attraction of the Airport to users and minimise the impacts of traffic on the congested roads in the ar ea, particularly the A386 Tavistock Road Northern Corridor into Plymouth. In the short term, this is probably best done by extending the existing bus serv ices serving Derriford Hospital. In the longer term, dedicated airport bus services, such as those serving Bristol Airport from Bristol City Centre , are an option. T he proximity of the Airport to Derriford Hospital has t he advantage of allowin g the Airport to piggy-back on the high quality bus serv ices to the Hospital and the disadvantage of the congestion caused by vehicle traffic to and from the hospital. 9.50 Whilst the closure of runway 06/ 24 and development of part of this land could on the face of it provide the oppor tunity to improve highway access to both the airport terminal area and Derrifo rd Hospital from the northwest, this opportunity will be affected by the viability of the development and the effects of maintaining a vehicular route th rough the development. Furthermore, in practice, the land that can be made av ailable followi ng the closure of runway 06/24 may be less than that indicated in the Derriford and Southway Area Planning Framework Draft Final Repor t because of the need to maintain adequate apron area to cope wit h additional flights. A through route for motor vehicles may not be possible. A route for pedestrians and cyclists should still be possible as there is a gap between two of the houses on Tavistock Road that is sufficient for this purpose. 9.51 We recommend that the Airport draw s up a surfac e access strategy to accompany any planning application for development. Conclusions Predicted use of the Airport 9.52 Assuming existing operational c onstraints remain, passenge r numbers travelling to and from Plym outh City Airport could increase by 100% by 2030. The increase could be as high as 630% by 2030, with the runway extended and an increase in the number of flights and destinations. Peak traffic flows to and from the Airport will depend on f light timings, the intervals between flights and aircraft passenger capacity. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 173 Key surface access issues 9.53 The Local Development Framework Area Action Plan for Derriford/Seaton and Southway identifies t he following key issues which are relevant to surface access to Plymouth City Airport: 4 how to reduce congestion on the A386 Tavistock Road caused by commuters to Derriford and the City Centre; and 4 how to promote the Airport as an important arrival point and means of transport for the City. 9.54 In terms of local access by all modes , the airport footprint itself severs access to the airport terminal from the northwest, north and northeast. Routes for pedestrians and cyclists 9.55 In overall terms, there are some good qualit y routes for walkers and cyclists that serve the Airport but most foot and cycle trips requires the use of heavily trafficked roads, notably the A386 Tavistoc k Road. The airport footprint itself severs movement on foot and cycle fr om the northwest, north and north east to and from the terminal area. Access by Road 9.56 Plymbridge Lane serves the Airport Terminal and other airport facilities. It connects with Derriford Road and thenc e, by way of a signal controlled roundabout with the A386 Tavistock Road. Access to the Airport by road is primarily gained via the A386 Tavisto ck Road Northern Corridor. Congestion hotspots along this inclu de A38 Manadon Junction (A38/A386) and A386 Tavistock Road. conges tion is likely during peak hours on Derriford Road, which serves both Derriford Hospital and residential areas, and Plymouth City Airport. Congestion is particularly acute at the junction between Derriford Road and the A386 Tavistock Road. Plymouth City Airport Study 174 York Aviation LLPAccess by public transport 9.57 There is currently no public transport di rect to the Airport Terminal other than by taxi. However, both Derriford Hospit al and St Mark and St John College are served by high frequency services to the city centre, railway station and other locations. There is potential to improve the service to the Airport Terminal by extending existing bus se rvices although this might require subsidy. Access to the Airport by public transport needs to be considered in conjunction with other devel opments in the area. Existing Parking Facilities 9.58 Existing car parking is adequate for present passenger numbers and car parking could be extended. However, im provement of public transport to the Airport might reduce the need for this. Transport Schemes 9.59 The public transport and highway schemes in the A386 Northern Corridor (Tavistock Road) should have benefits for Plymouth City Airport in reducing congestion. 9.60 The extension of the runway would require circ a 200 lorry movements per day over a one year construction period. The road network in the area is likely to be able to handle these movement s but it would be preferable if they could be avoided. Future Development in the Area 9.61 Plymouth City Airport, Derriford Hospit al and the College of St M ark and St John, combine to form an important em ployment centre within the City. However, they generate substantia l traffic which has seen the A386 Tavistock Road transport corridor at or near capacity with future traffic forecasts predicting fu rther traffic growth. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 175 9.62 This increased intensity of developm ent within the A386 co rridor is likely to see increased traffic flows in the ar ea. Depending upon ac tual layout the proposed development of the land partly occupied by runway 06/24 provides an opportunity to improve the lin ks between Derriford/Southway and the A386 to the north, particularl y for pedestrians and cyclists. Plymouth City Airport Study 176 York Aviation LLP10 ALTERNATIVE AIRPORT LOCATIONS Key Points 4 In view of the restrictions on the current airport site, we were asked to investigate once again whether there were any alternative sites suitable for a new airport to serve the City of Plymouth. 4 Our examination of all alternatives confirmed that the only realistic alternative site had been that in South Hams, considered prior to the Future of Air Transport White Paper. This site is no longer available. 4 In any event, construction of a new airport is highly unlikely to be financially viable simply as a replacement of Plymouth City Airport and could only realistically be considered as a replacement for two or more of the sub-region's airports. Reasons for an Alternative Airport 10.1 This report has highlight ed the physical restrictions of Plymouth City Airport, and also the environmental sensitivity of its current location. The length of the runway, even with the longest possibl e extension may always be seen as a barrier to the Airport achieving it s true potential becaus e of the limited aircraft types which could serve the Airport. 10.2 Residential development has been pe rmitted on sites s urrounding the Airport which have put local environmental pr essures on the airport operator, and in particular the noise impact of the Airport is viewed as the main environmental problems by local residents. 10.3 During the consultation for the Aviation White Paper66, a site for a possible new airport was proposed wit hin South Hams, to the east of Plymouth, near to the A38. Within the consultation, it was suggested that a new airport could act as a joint airport for Plymout h and Devon, leading to the closure of both Plymouth City and Exeter Airports. 66 Department for Transport, The Future of Air Transport (December 2003) Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 177 10.4 At the time of this proposal no additional sites were considered, and discussions with Sutton Harbour Holdings suggest that this site was put forward as it had been considered as a suitable site for an airport for a number of years. The site has, however, been identified within the Devon Structure Plan as being a site for 3,500 new homes. The site continues to be designated in the Structure Plan for such development, and indeed plans are now far more progressed, with an application for development expected within 2006. 10.5 The original proposal for this location would have been a 2,500 metre runway which would have permitted a wide r ange of aircraft, including all the types used by the European Low Cost Carriers. The airport may have potentially been able to offer some limited long haul routes. 10.6 By providing a new air port in the Plymouth sub-r egion it could be expected that, with the correct infrastructu re, the airport would have much more scope than the current facility. This is not the result of addi tional demand, but is based on the ability to encourage the us e of a wider number of airlines, operating a wider num ber of aircraft types. On this basis, the benefit of building a new airport may be that it can offer additional economic benefits and also that it may be more financia lly sustainable because it may handle more passengers. 10.7 However the costs of building a new airport are likely to be extremely high, and are likely to be prohibitive if Ex eter and Newquay Airports remain as competitors within the far South West. Whilst a new airport may be in a better position to make operational profits, it would seem likely that if the site were just serving the same local catc hment as the existing Airport then it may not be possible for the operating profits to cover any development financing costs. 10.8 Notwithstanding the potential viability difficulties, we have considered whether there are any suitable sites fo r development of a new airport within the Plymouth sub-region should the environmental issues and development costs prove prohibitive to expansion of Plymouth City Airport. In order to do this we undertook a desktop search using mapping to identify areas of land which: Plymouth City Airport Study 178 York Aviation LLP4 would be large enough to accommodat e an airport without the need to demolish large villages or parts of the conurbations for the site; 4 would reduce the impact on substantial residential areas of over flying aircraft approaching and leaving an airport; 4 would have relatively low gradient changes within the site area so as to minimise the necessary earthworks to make the site level enough for an airport; 4 would be located so that approach and take-off surfaces would not be affected by land height changes; 4 would be sufficiently close and accessible from Plymouth City (accepting that there would be some changes for residents in some areas using Plymouth Cit y Airport currently). 10.9 Whilst the airport site considered prior to the Future of Air Transport White Paper feat ured a 2500m runway, we opted to consider sites suitable for an airport with a runway length of 2,000m. At this length, t he airport would be capable of handling all shor t haul aircraft types, permitting them to fly throughout Europe. This w ould allow services by the Low Cost Carriers who typically use Boeing or Airbus shot haul aircraft. However, the runway length would exclude all long haul operations. Given that the closure of Exeter Airport is unlikely, we concluded that the range of services likely to be supported by the Plymouth catchment area would not require services beyond the major business and leisure points within Europe. 10.10 We have created an airport template, as shown in Figure 10.1 , providing a scaled site area and the required approac h and take-off surfaces. This was overlaid onto mapping to give an in dication of how an airport site would affect an area. The template illustrates an airport with: 4 runway length of 2000 metres; 4 300m wide ILS Runway strip; 4 space at each end for RESAs; 4 space for a perimeter r oad around the whole runway; Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 179 4 full parallel taxiway running the full length of the runway and situated between the runway and the terminal; 4 a full apron and terminal building; 4 space for car parking, forecourts and ancillary support and hangar facilities. Figure 10.1: Illustrative Template for Determining Potential New Airport Impact Source: York Aviation LLP 10.11 The large triangle at each end is t he approach surface and the smaller one the take off surface, below which in each case ground occupants would have varying degrees of noise awareness. The end extremities of the triangles could be curved slightly to avoid population, but we have generally assumed they remain as is - as is normal at mo st airports. These triangles should not be confused with PSZ as discussed earlie r in this report which would be dimensioned according the specific characteristics and throughput of a new site. Plymouth City Airport Study 180 York Aviation LLP10.12 A number of locations we re initially ident ified, and these are illustrated in Figure 10.2. Table 10.1 illustrates the journey ti mes from a selection of districts to each airport site. We se lected a criterion of approximately 30 minutes surface journey time to the centre otherwise a new airport would have little advantage to Plymouth over us e of Exeter and Newquay Airports, assuming both continue to operate.

Table 10.2 provides a summary of t he main reasons that these sites were excluded. The remainder of the sites were considered in more detail, including a site visit.

Alt hough aircraft are designed to withstand impact from birds, where there is a ri sk of hitting large flocks of birds then safety can be severely compromised. The area of study includes a number of estuaries, which at low tide may be havens for birds. Therefore, aircraft over flying these estuaries could be put at risk. Site 5 appeared at risk, as did sites 6, 8 and 11, although a site visit was used to confirm that such problems are likely to exist. Figure 10.3 and Figure 10.4 illustrate the environment of the estuaria l areas which are likely to give rise to such problems. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 183 Figure 10.3: Local Estuary With Potential for Bird Strike Issues Located Near Site 2 Source: York Aviation LLP 10.15 Of the remaining sites, we chose to include two which had journey times above the 30 minutes from Plymouth, Sites 2 and 13. On the mapping used, Site 2 appeared to cover relatively flat land, which could minimise development costs, and being just over 30mins from Plymouth may have been viable with upgraded road access. Site 13 was deemed to be too far from Plymouth for an airport only serving the existing catchment area, but being located to the west of Plymouth, and on what appeared to be relatively flat land which might be suitable for a new Plymouth and Cornwall airport if Newquay Airport were to close. Plymouth City Airport Study 184 York Aviation LLP Figure 10.4: Local Estuary With Potential for Bird Strike Issues Located Near Site 11 Source: York Aviation LLP Analysis of Sites Sites 1A and 1C - Sherford 10.16 Site 1A was the proposed location of a new airport within South Hams in 2003. We have included this site so as to understand what could be offered by this site, subject to po licy reviews within South Hams. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 185 10.17 Site 1C was selected as being in the same location, although with a minor shift in runway orientation. In the original proposal for an airport in this location, the runway wa s positioned east to west, but our analysis showed that this would lead to aircraft over fl ying some parts of southeast Plymouth. Site 1C would require a slight northwest-southeas t orientated runway to permit aircraft not to over fly any substantial residential areas. 10.18 This potential site benefits from bei ng loc ated close to the A38, with the nearest junction being grade separat ed and good quality, allowing ease of access. There are a number of private residencies an d hamlets in the area, and many traditional farm buildings al so appear to have been converted to residential properties. One hamlet could be directly affected by the site, this being Blackpool, however the number of pr operties in this location is limited. 10.19 Site 1A is not completely flat and appears to vary in he ight between 70 and 90m above sea level. However a site visit reveals that it is relatively flat and by comparison to other potential sites would not need quite so many earth works. Site 1C would require more works as the land height variation is greater, ranging bet ween 60m and 90m. 10.20 To the west of the site, approaching and departing aircraft would cross Billacombe and Pomphlett, assuming that the runway be located east to west. If the runway is orientated s lightly more northwest-southeast then no major residential area is affected. In bot h layouts, aircraft would be required to over fly a number of residentia l and commercial (particularly garden nursery) properties. Some of these properties would be affected by the Public Safety Zones (PSZ). Approaching aircraft would be required to over fly the centre of Plymouth. Plymouth City Airport Study 186 York Aviation LLP10.21 There do not appear to be any signific ant reasons for excluding these sites in terms of topography, access and noise impact (other than minor impact). However, part of the site is designated by the Devon Structure Plan and also within the emerging Sout h Hams Local Development Framework as being land for residential development. Whils t the site was already designated within the Devon Structure Plan at the time of the consultation, it was proposed by Sutton Harbour Holdings t hat with the releas e of land at both Exeter and Plymouth Airport sites then, with some denser level of development, the housing need could be met in alternative locations. Discussions with Plymouth City Counc il reveal that overturning these designations for the purpose of an airpor t would be unlikely, particularly as planning proposals are likely to be made to South Hams District Council later this year. Site 1B - Sherford 10.22 In the general area of Sites 1A and 1C, we dete rmined that by locating the airport marginally more east it would be possible for aircraft not to over fly the centre of Plymouth, instead they could fly over Plymouth Sound, then follow the line of the River Plym before then turning to approach the airport. Departing aircraft could follow the same ro ute in reverse. To both the east and west, aircraft would only over fly sm all hamlets and individual properties. 10.23 More work would be needed to re-profile the site by com parison to both sites 1A and 1C in this location, thereby increasing the cost of development. Furthermore, there is a brook to the east of the airport site which may require significant re-profiling. 10.24 Access to this site would require so me road upgrade work, al though it is still relatively close to the A38. It is likel y that the same grade separated junction could be used for this site as discussed for sites 1A and 1C. 10.25 It would be expected that part of this site would cross into the land designated for housing developmen t, and any housing beyond the boundary would fall within the PSZ area, which for new airport and new residential development would be unacceptable. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 187 Site 2 - St Annes Chapel 10.26 Site 2 was identified as being a pot ential site because the desk top analys is suggested the level of the land would be suitable and that the noise effects and direct impact of the airport site woul d be minimal. However, the site is over 30 minutes from Plymout h, and the site visit revealed that the quality of the A-roads leading towards this site were below the standards of other A- roads in the region, thus potentially slow ing journeys to the site still further. Road access from the A379 would also need to be upgraded. 10.27 The site is generally quite remote and this c ould cause issues for employing staff as there may be little demand for the type of work available at the airport for people living in the direct ar ea. This could mean that some staff will have to travel to and from Plymouth. 10.28 The site sits on the top of a hill and would require so me level of re-profiling work to make it level enough for an airpor t. However, the site visit showed that the area was subjec t to extremely high winds due to its exposed location. Only individual properties would be affected by the airport site, however the village of St. Anne's Chape l would lie on the site boundary and would therefore be subjected to noise and visual intrusion. 10.29 The site lies within an Area of Ou tstanding Natural Be auty and also within the South Devon He ritage Coast area67 and as such development on this scale is unlikely to be permitted. 10.30 Approaching and departing aircraft w ould not over fly any major population areas. Kingston would lie just outsi de of the approach surfaces, although it would be expected that this could be avoided. The airport would, however, be affected by potential bird hazards as it would lie betw een the estuaries of the River Erne and the River Avon. Because of the proximity of these the site would need to be excluded on this basis alone. However the access and remoteness issue, along with the potential for the site to be exposed to poor weather all contribute to a decision that this site would not be suitable. 67 South Hams Local Plan, January 2002 Plymouth City Airport Study 188 York Aviation LLP Site 6 - Down Thomas 10.31 Site 6 is located just to the east of the Plym outh Sound, on land to the south of parts of Plymouth. The proximity to the coast means that the area has a number of caravan parks and tourist attractions. The village of Down Thomas would be located directly to the south of the site, whilst Staddiscombe would be just to the north of the site. The site would lay within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty68. 10.32 Of the sites visited, this one had some of the greatest variations in land height and topography, rangi ng from 80m to 110m abov e sea level. This would require some significant re-profiling of the land. 10.33 Due to the site positio n, it would be necess ary for road access to be through large residential areas. Whilst the site visit reveals that some roads may be suitable, there is likely to be temptation to 'rat-run' through housing estates to reach the airport. 10.34 To both the east and the west, aircraft would not need to ov er fly any villages or substantial built up areas on appr oach or take-off. However, to the western end of the runway, the PSZ wo uld be likely to cover part of a golf course, although this would be unlikely to cause any problem. Aircraft approaching from the west would need to over fly the Mount Edgecombe Country Park. 10.35 There are several potential bird haz ard iss ues affecting both approaches. To the southeast, there is a large wood ed area, referred to on mapping as Train Brake and Wembury Woods. Beyo nd this wooded area is the estuary of the River Yealm which would also pose bird hazard issues. To the west aircraft would over fly the coastal cliffs of the Plymouth Sound, and the site visit reveals that these could be prone to birds nesting, which could pose a risk of bird strikes. 68 Ibid Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 189 10.36 Given the land height variations, t he potential surface access issues and the high risk posed by birds, we would s uggest that this site would not be suitable for development of a new airport. Site 9 - Buckland Monachorum 10.37 Site 9 would be located just north of Buck land Abbey, to the east of the River Tavy valley, slightly to the south of Buckland Monachorum. Buckland Abbey is a Registered Ancient Monument, whic h would be likely to be affected severely by abutting an airport site. 10.38 The height of land within the site is generally fairly flat, with height differences of about 10m in places across the site. To the northern side of the site, some land increases to ar ound 160m, although this land would be outside of the operational ar ea required for aircraft and so could be used for car parking or similar without the need to re-profile substantially. 10.39 The approach and take-off surfaces to the west appear to be clear of any substantial residential area. It woul d be necessary for aircraft approaching and departing to the east would need to over fly the Dartmoor National Park. Whilst this is not a justifiable reason to exclude the site, it is felt that it would be unacceptable in terms of potentially harming the tourism product of the area. To the east, a hamlet (Hoomeavy) would fall at the edge of the take-off surface, and so it would be likely to suffer over flying by arriving and possibly departing aircraft. Additiona lly, it appears from the map, and with visual confirmation from the site, that the land at both ends of the site rises too sharply to allow aircraft to approach on standard arrival paths, which would rule the site out. Plymouth City Airport Study 190 York Aviation LLPSite 11 - Landulph 10.40 Site 11 is located to the west of the River Tamar, between the A388 and Cargreen. Access to sites west of this river require that travellers cross over the Tamar Bridge. This has been hi ghlighted as a bottleneck for cars, particularly during peak hours. The site visit revealed that this is the case and that this could add add itional time onto any jour neys from the City in the peak. In addition to the bridge itself being congested (wit h toll booths and roundabouts holding up traffic), there are a number of roundabouts on the approaches from both the east and the we st to the bridge which appear to be prone to long traffic queues. 10.41 The site could have land height va riations of between 10-15m across the site, although is located close to some substantial changes in land height. 10.42 Aircraft on approach from and take-off to the east would not over fly any substantial residential areas. To the we st however the hamlets of Pillaton and Ellbridge would be affected, and in particular the PSZ would overlap with Ellbridge which could require some properties be removed. 10.43 The major issue for this site lies wit h the approach and take-off surfaces to the west being over the River T amar. A site visit reveals that during low tide this could encourage birds into the area and potentially cause bird hazard issues. Site 13 - Pengover Green 10.44 As described earlier in this section, site 13 was included for further analysis purely on the basis that there w as st ill uncertainty regarding the long term future of Newquay Airport. This si te is located some distance from Plymouth, but may be suitably placed to act as a joint airport should Newquay Close. The site is located to the east of Liskeard, and would be likely to require that residents of P engover Green be relocated to allow the site to be built over the hamlet. Pengover Green consists of between 25-30 houses, and as such the impact of the airport woul d be greater than anticipated from t he desk top study. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 191 10.45 As with site 11, access to this location from Plymouth would require travellers to cross the Tamar Bridge. The delays caused by this would be made worse by the long traffic queues which were witnessed to build up at the roundabouts along the A38 to the we st of Plymouth. The A38 is a 50mph zone for long stretches, making it a slower stretch of road than the A38 to the east of Plymouth. 10.46 The land height variations are the gr eatest of any site visited, which would add substantially to the cost of development in this location. However, if the airport were to handle the combined demand of the Pl ymouth and Newquay catchment areas, the income may be great enough to allow for this. 10.47 To both the east and west, aircraft woul d be able to fly into and out of the airport without having to over fly any substantial residential areas. Appraisal of Sites 10.48 Through our initial analysis and through site visits to more promising sites, it would appear that most sites have subs tantial issues which would either need to be addressed, or would prevent development altogether. 10.49 We have attempted to dev ise a scoring system to es tablish how crit ical each of the issues for each site will be, and w hether there are too many issues to allow a site to be developed as an airport. 10.50 We have therefore devised a simple system, the resu lts of which are shown in Table 10.3 . The basis of this system is t hat the issues ar e either graded as 1, 2 or 3, with 1 being a minor i ssue, and 3 being a major issue. By totalling the scores for various criteria fo r each airport site we can determine a ranking of which sites would be most viable. We have graded on the basis of 7 criteria, these are: 4 Distance from Plymouth: This is a measure of both the journey time from Plymouth and also a judgemental decision regarding the ease of access from Plymouth. Journey times should ideally be below 30 minutes, and problems such as the congestion at the Tamar Bridge would lead to a higher score; Plymouth City Airport Study 192 York Aviation LLP4 Topography: This is the shape and level of the land on which the airport will sit. As no site is likely to be perfectly flat to start with then low scores will apply to those sites needing the least work to provide a suitable level, whilst higher issue sco res will go to those sites requiring the most substantial works; 4 Accessibility: This is the accessibilit y of the site from an A-road, on the basis that access from the trunk road network w ould require substantial investment; 4 Direct Impact: This grades the num ber of properties and roads which will need to be removed in order that the airport can be built. As well as properties within any site, this also includes the affe cts on properties directly adjacent to the site; 4 Local Noise Impact: This measures the noise impact based on approaching and departing aircraft on local population centres as well as on properties located adjacent to an airport; 4 Bird Hazard: Because some sites are located in po sitions which may be prone to bird strikes we have include d a score for this. Essentially if a site scores highly for this (i.e. a score 3, major issue) then the site would automatically be ru led out for this reason; 4 Elevation: This is a score of t he height of the land and how this may affect the operational integrity of the air port due to poor weather conditions associated with high gr ound, it should be noted though that very few sites were higher than the current airport site, although this also suffers some weather constrai nts and so only the highest or most exposed locations would receiv e the highest score for this.

Only two sites scored 8, these being thos e located within the Sherford area originally proposed during the consultation for the Aviation White Paper. The actual site which was proposed (i.e. Si te 1A) scored 9 because of the fact that the original orientation would have led to more significant movements by aircraft over parts of Plymouth. 10.52 This would suggest that the origina lly defined site area would be the bes t option. However, we accept that this is not likely to be possible because of the designation of much of the land for residential development. 10.53 Ideally we would sugges t that if the impact on any element of the site was high enough to receive a score of 3 t hen the site would be unlikely to be suitable. Only the sites in the S herford area did not score 3 under any criteria. 10.54 Of the remaining sites visited all but two would automatically be exc luded because of the potential for bird strike s associated with the proximity to estuaries and cliffs suitable for birds to feed and nest. 10.55 However of the two remaining sites one is c onsidered to be unacceptably far from Plymouth (site 13) whil st the other would have severe direct impacts on Dartmoor and cannot offer the required approaches due to land elevations beyond the airport boundary. Conclusions 10.56 From the desk top search we could see that the area surrounding Plymouth was unlikely to have significant num bers of potential sites due to the topography. Whilst we were able to ident ify a number of pot ential sites, it became obvious through site visits and desk top research that none of these would offer suitable alternatives to the current airport location, at least in terms of providing an airport to so lely serve the Plymouth City area. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 195 10.57 The site area which still appears to offer the most potential is that in Sherford, as proposed during the Futu re of Air Transport White Paper consultation period. However, as di scussed earlier in this section, the possibility of policy changes being made to allow development in this location would be unlikely, although t he designation for housing within the South Hams LDF has yet to be confirmed by the LDF Inspector. 10.58 What must also be consi dered is the cost of a new airport of this scale. The costs associated with the development at the current airport site may be considered high, but could represent better value of investment to the region over the high cost of a whole new ai rport site. The runway extension schemes for the current airport site ar e likely to open up opportunities for services to the majority of major bus iness centres within the UK and Europe, and so a new airport of the scale we have considered would not offer substantial additional benefits to the business community. Given the relatively small air travel market in Pl ymouth, when considered on its own, it also does not appear likely t hat a new site w ould be financially viable unless it was on the basis of replacing the ex isting airports in the Far South West. Plymouth City Airport Study 196 York Aviation LLP11 APPRAISAL AND CONCLUSIONS 11.1 In this report, we have set the po licy background, market potential and key issues affecting the role of Plymouth City Airport in the sub-regional economy. In so doing, we have identified the baseline impact today and the potential impact under a num ber of development scenarios particularly relating to the runway and related infrastructure. 11.2 There are environmental sens itivities regarding the current airport site but these need to be placed in context. Although the Airport is surrounded by relatively densely populated areas, the numbers of people affected by aircraft noise is relatively low compar ed to other city airports and to the number of people who benefit from the presence of an airport. The key environmental issues relate to operati onal activities, largely on the ground, and helicopter operations at the airpor t which should be capable of improved management. 11.3 Because of the environm ental sensitivities of t he current site, we have reviewed and rejected alternative airpor t sites to service the Plymouth sub- region alone. 11.4 In our view, the central issue remains the viability of the Airport and the costs involved in securing its future. Thes e need to be examined in the context of the identified benefits to the Plymouth economy and the importance of having a viable airport to the realisation of the Vision for Plymouth and the City Growth Strategy. The Market 11.5 Our market assessment suggests that Plymouth City Airport could grow to be handling just over 1 million passenger s a year by 2030, based on meeting the needs of the local market. To the extent that strate gies to regenerate Plymouth lead to an increase in population and the employment base, growth in demand to use the Airport c ould be higher. Equally, maintaining and enhancing air service connectivity may be fundamental to achieving this 'City Growth Strategy' and the 'Mackay Vision'. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 197 11.6 In the event that Newquay Airport clos ed to commercial traffic, due to either the MoD pulling out or int ensification of use of RA F St Mawgan, there would be potential for Plymouth to serve more of the air travel market to and from Cornwall. However, Cornwall Coun ty Council is actively working to safeguard the future of Newquay Air port. Our analysis would suggest that Plymouth may be a more convenient, in te rms of surface access, airport to serve parts of east Cornwall than New quay but penetration of this market is presently more limited. This presents a marketing opportunity for the Airport in any event. 11.7 Significantly, however, the success of the Air Southwes t operation is, in part, underpinned by the vibrancy of the Newquay market, without which their operation would be commercially more vulnerable. In the event that restrictions were imposed on the use of Newquay Airport, this would restrict the ability of Air Southwest to expand its operations. Other carriers might be persuaded to serve the Plymouth market and, if the Airport was successful in marketing itself as a gateway to Corn wall, traffic levels substantially in excess of 1 million pa ssengers per annum could be achieved by 2030. However, notwithstanding current uncer tainties regarding the future of Newquay Airport, we do not believe that this would be a sound basis upon which to plan and assess the viabi lity of Plymouth City Airport. 11.8 Exeter Airport does co mpete with Plymouth for t he South Devon c atchment area. However, we believe that the local Plymouth city region market is capable of sustaining its own local air service offer, allowing for competition from an expanding offer fr om Exeter Airport, pr ovided that the physical challenges at Plymouth City Ai rport can be overcome. 11.9 The critical issue for Plymouth City Airport is ensuring that it remains attractive for airlines to use it a nd to expand their ope rations. During the time we have been preparing this report, the Airport has suffered a withdrawal by Air Wales. This, coupled with temporary movement restrictions imposed by the CAA, has resulted in promising growth trends reversing. Plymouth City Airport Study 198 York Aviation LLP11.10 Whilst we remain confident of the underlying potential for growth at Plymouth City Airport, it is clear that the Airport faces subs tantial challenges to ensure that it is capable of realis ing its potential, particularly in terms of operational runway length. In addition, securing growth will require t he Airport to be commercially attractive to airlines, offering low airport charges, which presents further challenges for securing viability. 11.11 Theoretically, the Airport could cont inue to see growth with t he existing runway length and with only the existing RESA provisio n, but we believe that this is not a sustainable position in the medium to long term as current physical shortcomings will make it more difficult to attract new carriers, leaving the Airport overly reliant on Air Southwest. In our view, a 'do nothing' option in terms of infrastructure is a high risk strategy which is unlikely to secure a viable long term future for the Airport. Overall, whilst our assessment of the potential realisable ma rket with no further runway works suggests that the Airport could grow to be handling almost 800,000 passengers by 2030 with no further extensi on to runway length available, we ascribe a very high risk to the achievabil ity of this level of traffic given the unattractiveness of the airport offer to airlines. Infrastructure 11.12 The key issue for Plymouth City Airport is the length of its runway and the restrictions this imposes. Whilst the existing runway length is adequate for current operations and woul d allow some growth of the route network within the UK and near Europe us ing current aircraft type s, these aircraft are gradually being replaced by larger turbo- prop aircraft and regional jets which require a longer runway. 11.13 Furthermore, the inability to increase aircraft size as demand grows will act as a deterrent to expanding operations from Plymouth, particularly given the relatively close proximity of Exeter and Newquay Airports. Generally, the cost of operating larger aircraft is lower than smaller aircraft, hence sustaining operations at Plymouth wit h very small aircraft will become uneconomic in the longer term. Eventua lly, we anticipate that the current types using Plymouth City Airport will become obsolete and that replacement aircraft will be unable to use the runway at is current length. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 199 11.14 Whilst the CAA has presently lifted tem porary restrictions on the number of movements using the Airport, impos ed because of the absence of an undershoot RESA at the eastern end of the runway, we believe that it can only be a matter of time before binding restrictions are imposed on the Airport in the absence of the requir ed RESAs at both ends of the runway. The options presented by the CAA of s hortening the usable runway length or capping the number of movements makes it unlikely that the Airport will have a long term future unless the issues are resolved. Air Southwest has made clear that it would be unwilling to operate with a shorter declared landing distance, implied by the inset threshold. Capping the num ber of movements, whilst allowing existing operations to be sustained and with passenger growth up to the maximum capacity of current operations, would mean that the Airport would not be financially viable in the medium to long term. 11.15 Providing the eastern RESA with or without extending the runway then becomes that only means by which the long term future of the Airport, and the contribution it can increasingly ma ke to the local economy, can be secured. Two schemes are now be ing put forward by Sutton Harbour Holdings. The first would utilise the R ESA as a starter extension to provide extended take-off distances for aircraft but with the landing distance limited to current dimensions. The second wo uld provide a full extension of the runway to 1,319m for both landings and take-offs as well as the required RESAs. In both cases, embankment wo rks would be required to the east of the Airport. The shorter runway scheme could form a first phase of development and land would need to be safeguarded in the LDF for the full extension. 11.16 The other infrastructure issues re late to the location of terminal and hangar/maintenance related facilities. We believe that there is no case for relocating the passenger terminal as or iginally proposed by Sutton Harbour Holdings, even allowing for the possibilit y of direct access from the A386. Extension in situ is a more cost effective option, particularly when runway 06/24 is closed allowing additional space for the aircraft apron. Plymouth City Airport Study 200 York Aviation LLP11.17 The critical issue is the locati on of the hangar and engine test bay, as relocation of these is fundamental to rel easing a significant area of land at the southern end of runway 06/24 for disp osal and alternative use. This is fundamental to raising capital to enabl e the development of the RESA and runway extension. There are environmental issues which are material to this relocation and resolution of this iss ue is fundamental to establishing the overall financial viability of the runway extension plan. Environmental Impact 11.18 In this report, we have set out the environmental bas eline regarding Plymouth City Airport. As we have indicated, the key issue centres on the noise impact of aircraft maintenance related activities and helicopter operations, rather than the impact of expanded commercial aircraft operations themselves. Engine testing ac tivity is essentially related to the Air Southwest base at the Airport; the loss of which w ould be extremely damaging to the prospects for passenger growth at Plymouth City Airport, whilst helicopter operations both make a material contribution to financing the airport operation as well as underpinning a part of the continuing presence in Plymouth. 11.19 It is clear that expansion of the Airport wil l require improved nois e mitigation measures to be put in place. Ho wever, undue restrict ion on operations could have a severe adverse impact on t he viability of the Airport and could hasten closure if imposed before growth in commercial operations provides a compensatory income stream. Emphas is should therefore be on noise mitigation measures, such as relocati on and full screening of the engine test bay. These measures have a cost whic h would need to be considered in the final investment appraisal. 11.20 Over and above the noise impact of the Airport, we have identified a number of other environmental c oncerns but none of these would appear significant impediments to growth and expansion of the Airport. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 201 Surface Access 11.21 The Airport is located in the in creasingly congested A386 corridor. This congestion is partly a function of the successful development of the Derriford area as a medical/high tech cluster. T he location of this cluster adjacent to the Airport suggests opportunities for synergies between the attraction of new firms to the area and the need fo r improved access to London and other key business cities. 11.22 At the present time, the Airport is not serv ed by public transport, although there are good connections to Derriford itself. Improved public transport access will be essential to securing t he ability of the Airport to grow and consideration should be given to ex tending bus routes from Derriford Hospital to the Airport. 11.23 Physical development of the Airport will re sult in severance of some road and footpath links to the east of the site, the impacts of which will need to be the subject of further study. Howeve r, release of the runway 06/24 land offers some opportunity for improv ed connections between Derriford and Tavistock Road. Further c onsideration will need to be given to how this is secured at the deta iled planning stage. Economic Impact 11.24 We have evaluated the economic impact of the Airport. In so doing, we have included the economic activity deriving from the presence of the Air Southwest base at Plymouth. In our view, these go hand in hand as without the commitment of Air Southwest to it s home base airport, the future of Plymouth City Airport could not be secured. 11.25 Currently the Airport s upports 242 job opportunities on site (222 FTEs), of which 64% are resident in the City of Plymouth. Ov erall, activity at the Airport generates around \u00a312.2m of gr oss value added annually to the Devon and Cornwall economy, of which around 1/3rd is realised in Plymouth. Taking indirect and induced impact into account the Airport supports around 320 jobs. Plymouth City Airport Study 202 York Aviation LLP11.26 If the Airport is able to grow, the m easurable contribution to employment and gross value added in the sub-region will increase, albeit economies of scale in airport operations mean t hat growth will be at a slower rate than absolute passenger growth. If the Airport were ab le to support a throughput of around 1mppa by 2030, then it would be support ing in total some 1,480 jobs including direct, indirect and induced jobs and generating a gross value added in Devon and Cornwall of \u00a3125.8m. In the context of the need for growth of jobs and value within t he sub-regional economy, the potential contribution is not insignificant. 11.27 However, the most impor tant potential im pact of th e Airport is to the wider regeneration of the Plymout h economy. It is not po ssible to quantify the impact nor to relate the pot ential specifically to the key strategy elements as the strategy for implementing the Vision for Plymouth is still being developed. 11.28 Nonetheless, it is clear that air serv ice accessibility is one of the key drivers of city grow th, impacting on: 4 attracting of new high tech and creative industries; 4 attracting new short break /high spending tourist visits; 4 improving productivity of local companies through reducing journey times. 11.29 The image value to Plymouth of having an airport should not be underestimated as this is almost as im portant as the actual cont ribution of the Airport to realising wider development. 11.30 To provide some measure of the wid er benefits from the existe nce of the Airport, we have examined the journey time savings made by airport users through being able to fly direct to Plymouth rather than having to use alternative airports or modes of transport. We a ssess that currently, these amount to \u00a33 million per annum to UK residents today, rising to \u00a340 million or more by 2030 if the Airport devel ops, allowing for growth in passenger numbers and increasing values of time as incomes rise. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 203 11.31 The Airport also has the potential to improve the connectedness of Plymouth as a place to do business. Presently Pl ymouth is less well connected by air than many of the cities whic h it aspires to be like in terms of the Vision. Our assessment of the likely routes and services whic h Plymouth City Airport could attract in the longer term, with the infrastructure in place, suggests that the air service connectedness of Plym outh and its attractiveness, on this dimension, as a place to do business co uld double. However, this would still leave it less well connected than most of its comparator cities. The contribution of the Airport is thus beneficial but cannot be seen as a key driver of economic growth in the absence of other critical success factors. Appraisal 11.32 In this section, we attempt to draw together our analysis in the form of an overall appraisal of airport options. During the course of our study three core scenarios have emerged: 4 Do nothing - no RESA works; 4 Short runway extension comprisi ng RESA works and us e of RESAs for take-off; 4 Full or long runway extensio n comprising RESA works and the maximum runway extension. 11.33 It should be noted that under any option, the runway at Plymouth City Airp ort will still be too short to offer anything other than regional aircraft operations. The longer runway extension would allow regional jet operations, which are little noisier than turboprops but offer greater passenger comfort and greater range. With the short runway extension, although jet operations would theoretically be possible, we consider that the Airport would be in essence restricted to turbo-props, albeit the la test models, due to restrictions on landing distances. Plymouth City Airport Study 204 York Aviation LLPDo Nothing 11.34 The critical issue is that with the do nothing scenario, there is a h igh risk that the Airport will stagnate and ultimately close because of the limitation to aircraft types which are nearing the end of their production life. This makes the Airport unattractive to airlines s eeking new opportunities for growth and would leave the Airport overly dependent on Air Southwest. It would also be under continuing threat of further operating restrictions by the CAA. In these circumstances, the medium to long te rm future of the Airport cannot be assured as the Airport is less likel y to reach the levels of throughput necessary to secure financial viability . Whilst we have shown theoretical potential for growth under this scenario, t here is a high risk that this potential will not be realised. 11.35 The discounted value of journey ti me benefits over the period 2006 to 2030 from retaining the exis ting airport in operation and able to expand within the limits of its existing runway length would be some \u00a321 0million to residents of the South West of England. Much of this benefit derives from services to London. Although user benefits of this order are not in themselves sufficient to justify public sector investment in the Airport, coupled with wider considerations of the cont ribution of the Airport to realising the Vision for Plymouth, this would suggest that the value of having an Airport warrants a degree of public sector support. 11.36 Under a 'do nothing' scenario, the future of the Airport cannot be guaranteed, hence the benefit s stated above becom e losses to the sub- regional economy if operation of the Airport became unviable and it closed. In our view, investment at least in the RESAs/short runway scheme will be necessary to secure these benefits in the longer term. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 205 Short Runway Option 11.37 We have set out in Sect ion 6, the costs necessary to deliver this short runway extension scheme. Assuming that the development proceeds from disposal of the runway 06/24 land are reinvested in the development by all parties - Sutton Harbour Holdings, the City Council and SWRDA - and assuming further investment by Sutton Ha rbour Holdings, there is a potential funding gap of around at \u00a38. 4million. To the extent that construction costs are less than has been estimated this funding gap will narrow. 11.38 Although our analysis would suggest that the incremental us er benefits from investing in the short runway extens ion, over and above maximising the potential of the current c onfiguration, might only just match the residual funding gap, the case for public sector intervention needs to be seen in the light of the high risk that the Airport w ould not continue in operation without the investment in providing the RE SAs and at least the short runway extension. Overall, t he user benefits, discounted over the period to 2030, from having the short runway scheme in place would amount to some \u00a3220 million, suggesting a benefit to cost ratio well in excess of the cost of the investment even taking all the sunk costs and reinvested proceeds into account. Long Runway Extension 11.39 The additional fundi ng requirement to provide t he longer runway extension is some \u00a310 million on the basis of current cost estimates, giving a funding gap on the same basis of \u00a318.4 million. Given the potential to serve a wider range of destinations with regional jet aircraft, the incremental user benefits from this option amount to some \u00a3300 million discounted over the period 2006 to 2030. In theory this would give a benefit/cost ratio of 3, suggesting that there may be a case for supporting this larger scheme on the basis of incremental benefits to users. This longer runway scheme needs to be seen as a potential second phase of devel opment and the land safeguarded within the LDF in any event. Plymouth City Airport Study 206 York Aviation LLPConclusion 11.40 It should be pointed out that our appr aisal of costs and benefits presented above can only be provisional at this st age. However, it appears to us that the actual user benefits from reta ining Plymouth City Airport and the potential benefits in terms of the contribution to ac hieving the Vision for Plymouth would justify a level of conti nued public sector support. The 'do nothing' option, implyi ng no further investment, runs a high risk of the Airport closing as the threshold for operat ional viability would not be reached, particularly as seems likely new airlines and air services cannot be attracted in sufficient quantity with the existing infrastructure. Further restrictions imposed by the CAA over time would be a further risk to continued commercial operations. 11.41 In these circumstances, some invest ment i n further enhancement of airport facilities is essential to securing a lo nger term future for the Airport. On the basis of the current analysis, the s hort runway extension would appear to give greatest returns relative to the sca le of investment. However, the work we have done to date does not represent a formal investment appraisal as this would require: 4 a fully detailed and costed scheme; 4 refinement of the market assessment in the light of recent airline developments; 4 confirmation of the proceeds from di sposal of the runway 06/24 land; 4 consideration of the extent to which the Cit y Council and SWRDA are prepared to reinvest any proceeds from land disposal; 4 confirmation from Sutton Harbour Hold ings of the extent of its further investment. 11.42 Our analysis of the environmental i ssues would suggest that, whilst nois e from ground operations is a signif icant issue locally, the overall environmental impact of the Airport is not substantial. It will, hence, be important that the airport development scheme include s within it measures to mitigate the impact and to reduce dependence on high noise generating operations over time. Plymouth City Airport Study York Aviation LLP 207 11.43 Surface access to the Airport may be a concern but this is driven more by congestion within the Derriford area as a result of other developments in the area than from airport growth. Connecti ng the Airport to the local public transport network will be important.

Belfast City Airport's noise management strategy revolves around a Section 106 Agreement and Operational Nois e Ab atement Procedures. The result is a composite set of restrictions which currently include: 4 Limitation on airport operating hours (0630-2130) 4 ATM movements cap (45,000 per annum) 4 Restriction on the number of seats for sale on flights from the airport (1,500,000 per annum) 4 Noise abatement routings 4 Installation of Fixed Ground Power Units on all 10 aircraft stands in front of the terminal 4 Commissioning of an independent Community Survey to evaluate residents' attitudes towards aircraft noise Birmingham International Airport 64. Birmingham Airport has six major policy areas in respect of aircraft noise. These include: 4 Operation of an airport noise and operations m onitoring system (ANOMS), with a capability of tra cking aircraft up to a 12 mile radius from the airport. In addition a community and environmental management tool, AIRVON, allows additional analyses such as population and housing analysis for noise contours and noise preferential routes 4 Full noise complaints handling procedure is in pl ace, which provides a detailed response to all complainants. 4 Night flying policy ( with an annual Quota Count) 4 Noise preferential routes, with penalties for infringement 4 Ground engine running restrictions 07:00 to 23:00 No engine testing between 10:30 and 12:30 on Sundays 4 Noise insulation scheme Bournemouth International Airport 65. Bournemouth has no formal policy in pl ace, but implements certain measures in order to achieve their aim of being a 'good neighbour'. These measures are: 4 Noise preferential routings ( but no monitoring or penalty system) 4 Minimum circuit height of 1500 ft 4 Preferential runways for departures and arrivals 4 Engine ground running restricted to certain time periods 4 Provision of a dedicated noise complain ts line. All calls are investigated and a response is provided. A statis tical summary is prepared for all telephone and written complaints, wh ich is presented to the Airport Consultative Committee Bristol International Airport 66. Bristol Airport has no formal noise policy, but has recently undertaken a major consultation exercise with lo cal residents, businesses and other organisations to agree a series of noise control measures with North Somerset Council. These are as follows: 4 Development of Noise Preferentia l Routes, in conjunction with local Parish Councils 4 Night-time flying restrictions 4 Operation of an aircraft noise quota system, based on those used at London Heathrow and Gatwick. The quota applies between 2330-0600. Aircraft with a quota count of 4 or above are not norma lly allowed to take-off or land between 2300-0600 Cardiff International Airport 67. In common with other UK regional air ports, Cardiff International Airport has instigated a number of noise c ontrol measures. These are: 4 Operation of Noise Preferent ial Routes (Departures only) 4 Preparation of noise contours (for a typical summer weekday, summer weekend, winter weekday and winter weekend) 4 Request that pilots use reverse thru st to a minimum, particularly after 2130 hours, consistent with operational needs 4 Restriction on ground running of engines between 2130-0700 Exeter International Airport 68. Exeter Airport has a formal policy statement on a range of en vironmental issues including aircraft noise. Nois e control measures adopted include: 4 Noise preferential routings (although these are less precisely defined in comparison to other UK airports) 4 Noise complaints concerning known or suspected known civil aircraft to be referred to the Airport Director Leeds Bradford International Airport 69. Leeds Bradford Airport has a stated policy to 'be a considerate neighbour and minimise as far as possible the e ffec ts and disturbance of noise from aircraft and airport operations. The noise control measures in place include: 4 Noise preferential routings and pr ocedures applying to all aircraft with a MTOW greater than 5,700 kgs 4 Target daytime noise levels: Take-off - No greater than 92 dBA by day or 84 dBA by night Approach - No greater than 85 dBA by day or 79 dBA by night 4 Operating quota - No departures in the night-time period (2300-0700) shall take place by aircraft with a quota count of 1,2,4,8 or 16. No landings shall take place with a quota count of 2,4,8, or 16. 4 APU operating restrictions between 2300-0600 4 Continuous operation of a Lochard Noise Monitoring and 4 Track-keeping system with four permanent noise monitors Liverpool International Airport 70. Liverpool Airport's noise control measures inc lude: 4 Use of preferential runways for take-off and landing 4 Operation of a noise quota system with the following restrictions 2300-2330 - Aircraft with quota count of QC/8 or QC/16 must not be scheduled to take-off or land 2330-0600 - Aircraft with quota count of QC/8 or QC/16 must not take off or land 0600-0700 - Aircraft with a quota count of QC/ 16 must not take off or be scheduled to land 4 Certain exemptions apply 4 Noise monitoring and track-keeping syst em in place with two fixed and one mobile terminals London City Airport 71. Due to its city centre location, London Cit y Airport has the most stringent operational and noise constraints out of all UK airports. The following noise measures are currently in place: 4 Noise abatement procedures apply on departure and arrival 4 Airport opening hours are as follows: Weekdays - 0630-2200 Saturdays - 0630-1230 Sunday - 1230-2200 Bank Holidays - 0900-2200 4 Limitation on ATMs (restricted to 240 on weekday and 140 on Saturdays and Sundays) 4 Limitation on factored ATM movements, based on the aircraft noise category (ranging from Category A equi valent to 1.26 ATMs to Category E equal to 0.08 ATMs). The overa ll annual factored ATMs should 15% of the permi tted number of ATMs in any one week or 73,000 per calendar year 4 The maximum permitted aircraft noise level is Category A (91.6-94.5 PNdB). In addition, all aircraft mu st be capable of making an approach at 5.5 degrees or steeper in comparison to the normal approach of 3 degrees at most other airports 4 A noise surcharge may be imposed for aircraft exceeding the noise limits 4 A noise monitoring system is in place with four monitoring points London Heathrow, Gatwick a nd Stansted Airport 72. The noise control measures in place at London Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Airports are comp lex and are currently under Government review. These currently include: 4 Noise abatement procedures app ly at all three airports 4 Preferred runway operations (eg the Cranford Agreement at London Heathrow precluding departures fr om 09L except in exceptional circumstances) 4 Operation of a noise quota system (QC/0.5 - QC /16), with night time flying restrictions on QC/8 and QC/16 aircraft 4 Limitation on the total quota count in both the Winter and Summer seasons 4 Restrictions on APU and engine ground running 4 Operation of noise monitoring and track-keeping systems at all three airports (Heathrow - 10 terminals, Gatwick - 5 terminals and Stansted - 8 terminals) 4 The Government review relates to the night flying restrictions to be applied for a six year per iod from Autumn 2005. Of particular concern is the number of flights permitted at Heathrow between 0430-0600 (currently an average of 16 arrival ai rcraft) and the noise classification of particular aircraft and engine types. London Luton Airport 73. Luton Airport's noise control measures include: 4 Noise Preferential Routing and Pr ocedures as published in the AIP 4 Certain ground engine running restrictions 4 Noise charges apply for all departing and arrivals aircraft, calculated as a proportion of the landing fee.
