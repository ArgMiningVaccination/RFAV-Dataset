Introduction Around one billion persons do not possess access to secured potable water and 150 million persons use surface water instead of potable water [1] [2]. In deve l- oping countries, a large part of the illnesses stays provoked by pathogens i n- fected water [2] . Thus, furnishing secured potable water remains a huge dare to humans [2]. As a part of the present water treatment techniques, chlorination [3] [4] [5], ozonation [6] , and ultraviolet (UV) technology remain frequently employed for killing pathogens and treating water [7] [8]. However, the two first methods form toxic disinfection by -products (DBPs) and the last one suffers from energy consumption [9] [10] [11]. To deal with such challenges, solar w a- ter disinfection (SODIS) was proposed as a cost -effective, point -of-use water treatment process, and especially practicable in developing countries [12] [13] [14]. Nonetheless, su ch a technique needs a comparatively longer period (from many hours to many days) for killing microbes following the intensity of access-ible sunlight and water contamination [2] . Consequently, if more important d is- infection rates in direct sunlight could be attained, it could certainly be a viable solution to the remaining disinfection techniques accessible [15] [16] . As an encouraging green method for ecological treatment and water re me- diation, photocatalysis has emerged during the past thirty years [2] . In phot o- catalytic disinfection technology, semiconductors with an appropriate optical bandgap may be employed as photocatalysts to produce reactive oxygen species (ROSs) in the occurrence of light for demobilizing microbes. Combining phot o- catalysis and SODIS methods seems to be a plausible concept to increase the k i- netics of SODIS [2] . This work aims t o focus on Escherichia coli especially its health impacts, e x- posure evaluation, and hazard reduction. This work firstly defines microbiolog i- cally E. coli bacteria and presents a brief history relating to their first discovery and following contagions. To understand E. coli's behavior, a short description relating to their metabolism and physiology is given. As humankind is concer ned by E. coli contagion, t heir clinical characteristics are discussed besides their su b- sistence in nature. A general examination concerning different techniques used D. Ghernaout et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108860 3 Open Access Library Journal for controlling such bacteria is finally presented. 2. Microbiological Viewpoint and Natural History 2.1. Microbiological Viewpoint In most cases, E. coli are Gram- negative, rod shaped (2.0 - 6.0 mm in length and 1.1 - 1.5 mm wide bacilli) bacteria with rounded ends ( Figure 1 ) [1] [15]. The real form of such microbes could, nonetheless, change from spherical (cocci) cells to elongated or filamentous rods [17] [18]. E. coli are non -spore forming, and are generally motile through the action of peritrichous flagella. E. coli are facultatively ana erobic and generate gas from fermentation of carbohydrates, as seen by acid and gas formation from lactose at 37C and 44C. Most E. coli produce a positive ortho -nitrophenyl --D-galactoside (ONPG) reaction, sho w- ing -galactosidase activity. The methyl red reaction is also positive for E. coli showing mixed acid fermentation of glucose; however, the Voges -Proskauer reaction (acetoin production) is negative. E. coli generate indole, yet are not able to hydrolyze urea or develop in M\u00f8ller 's KCN broth (depicting an incapability to develop in the existence of cyanide). In addition, formation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is not usually clear when E. coli are cultured on triple sugar iron (TSI) agar or Kligler 's iron agar (KIA). E. coli as well do not induce gelatin liquefaction via gelatinase activity. The majority of strains decarboxylate lysine, utilize sodium acetate, yet do not develop on Simmons ' citrate agar, where citrate is the only carbon source [1] . Figure 1. Typical microscope image of E. coli cells processed with Microbe Tracker [15]. D. Ghernaout et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108860 4 Open Access Library Journal Numerous E. coli cells are capsulated or microcapsulated and such capsules are constituted of acidic polysaccharides [1] . Mucoid strains of E. coli generate extracellular slime consisting either of a polysaccharide of certain K antigen sp e- cificities, or a usual acid polysaccharide (frequently reported as M antigen) formed of colanic acid [19] . E. coli display fimbriae (or pili) of changing stru c- ture and antigenic specificity and since such fimbriae are hydrophobic, they fu r- nish host - or organ -specific adhesion features. Many E. coli serogroups are familiar and the plurality is non-pathogenic; non e- theless, several groups could provoke dangerous diarrhoeal disease, sometimes with fatal outcome. E. coli is of faecal origin a nd is almost exclusively detected in the digestive tract of warm -blooded animals, especially human beings. Ther e- fore, observation of E. coli in drinking water is employed as an indicator of h u- man or animal excreta pollution, and is known as the coliform index [20] . The most famous and well -investigated E. coli is enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) E. coli [1] [21]. \" O157\" serogroup possess the usual somatic (cell surface) O antigen, while the flagellar H antigen is employed to define the specific serotype. E. coli O157: H7 is seen as one of the most pro b- lematic and pathogenic serotypes, and is frequently synonymously refer red to as EHEC. From 1982 to 2002, E. coli O157: H7 was notified in 49 states of the USA and related to 73,000 illnesses [22] . Such serotype manifests extended sub sis- tence in water at low temperatures [23] [24]. Subsistence was indeed depicted to expand beyond 8 months in a farm water gutter, and such microbes were then capable to colonize cattle. Importantly, swimming in polluted water has as well led to outbreaks of contagion [25] [26] . Some less frequently faced strains of E. coli could be found in nature and drinking water re servoirs, and could as well provoke diarrhoeal illnesses (like dehydrating diarrhoea and traveler 's diarrhea [27] ) via changing routes [1] . The incubation period for disease depends on strain and this is mostly related to the changing pathogenic routes revealed. In most cases, the incubation period is 1 - 2 days, even so could expand to 5 days. Even if the pathogenic character of E. co- li has been recognized for a long time, its character as an enteric pathogen has not long ago been reinforced via the manifestation of E. coli O157: H7 and the relationship of such strain with haemorrhagic enteritis and haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [28] . E. coli are linked with a set of human infections, following circulation from the intestines of patients who have an underlying problem [1]. As an illustration, urinary tract infections (UTIs) attributed to E. coli frequently happen following direct diffusion from the rectum to the urethra. Infections at other body sites commonly grow by haematogenous diffusion (through the blood stream), as t y- pified by appearance of meningitis in young babies. E. coli are as well a frequent reason for postoperati ve wound contagion, where direct infection of the wound (when the bowel was opened) could grow, or indirect infection by faecal infe c- tion of patient fingers. E. coli can as well infect patients via colonized members of the h ealth care team, as well as other patients [1] . D. Ghernaout et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108860 5 Open Access Library Journal As aforesaid, some strains of E. coli provoke diarrhoea after faecal -oral diffu- sion from humans and animals [1] . The next sections will be dedicated mostly to diarrhoeal contamination emerging from the different pathogenic types of E. co- li and will define the epidemiology and clinical characteristics as well as vir u- lence factors and their underlying genetic pathways [29] . 2.2. Natural History Escheri chia coli was originally discovered in 1885 and called \" Bacterium coli \" [30] by Dr. Theodor Escherich, a German paediatrician [1] . He discovered the bacterium during investigations of the intestinal flora of infants. After that, the bacterium was established to possess pathogenic features implying extraintesti n- al contamination [1]. Up until 1919, the name \" Bacterium coli \" was largely em- ployed and then Castellani and Chalmers [31] described the genus Escherichia and established the type species E. coli [1]. There are at least six principal diarrheagenic pathovars of E. coli (two diffe r- ent pathovars are related to UTIs and neonatal meningitis) and each type int e- grates some form of initial attachment to the host cell with following harmful results, either via t he elaboration of a toxin, or direct action [32] . Such E. coli types comprise the already mentioned along with and diffuse adherent E. coli (DAEC). Each specific type provokes diarrhoeal disease by numerous routes and each disease manifests with many clinical symptoms [1 ]. 3. Metabolism and Physiology, and Clinical Characteristics 3.1. Metabolism and Physiology Most strains of E. coli have the potential to ferment lactose, and the occurr ence of lactose will as well display a positive ONPG reaction via the activity of - galactosidase [1]. E. coli forms indole from the amino acid tryptophan via action of the enzyme tryptophanase, and this is a special property of E. coli from other enteric bacteria [33] . E. coli are incapable to hydrolyze urea and as well do not form gelatinase [1] . E. coli do not develop in M\u00f8ller 's KCN broth due to development inhibition by cyanide. H2S generation is usually absent when E. coli are grown on TSI and KIA. These media are utilized to reveal fermentation of specific carbohydrates and via integration of sodium thiosulfate and iron allow H 2S detection. E. coli does not deaminate phenylalanine, while most strains can decarboxylate lysine and use sodium acetate. E. coli do not grow on Simmons ' citrate agar, which includes ci- trate as the sole carbon source. The biochemical properties of the Escherichia genus are l isted in Table 1 , and those of E. coli are given in Table 2 . 3.2. Clinical Characteristics A century ago, Muir and Ritchie [34] were the premier to define the pathogenic D. Ghernaout et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108860 6 Open Access Library Journal Table 1.

In certain circumstances it a cquires pathogenicity, and may cause local or general infection. It is a frequent cause of acute and chronic infection of the urinary tract, and may give rise to an acute or chronic cholecystitis\" [1] . Nowadays, E. coli is rated as a harmless member of the normal microbiota of the human inhabiting the distal end of the intestinal tract [1] . The organism is usually acquired at birth or via the faecal oral route from the mother and also from nature. The serotypes of E. coli that provoke contaminations are listed in Table 3 . E. coli remains the most prevalent reason for acute UTIs and urinary tract sepsis [35]. E. coli could as well rise neonatal meningitis and sepsis, and as well abscesses in several organ systems. E. coli can as well occasion acute enteritis in humans, as well as animals and is a reason for \"traveler 's diarrhea\" , dysenteryl- ike disease touching humans and haemorrhagic colitis frequently known as \"bloody diarrhea\" . Numerous oral challenge investigations have been performed with E. coli serogroups to evaluate infection doses. The fin dings of such invest i- gations propose that levels of 105 - 1010 EPEC organisms, 108 - 1010 ETEC and 108 cells of EIEC have to be ingested to bring about diarrhoea and infection. Such numbers will naturally change with the age and sex of the recipient as well as the acidity of stomach. For EHEC, the infective dose that is apt to provoke cont a- mination is less than 100 [1]. EHEC is the E. coli serogroup that is probably of most clinical concern. Such microbes are recognized to provoke HUS, a case that is distinguished b y acute renal failure and generally happens in children under the age of 5 years old. An D. Ghernaout et al.

The pathogenic pathways of the major pathogenic gro ups of E. coli are summarized by Percival and Williams [1] . 4. Subsistence in Nature The normal source of E. coli stays in the inte stine of humans and other warm- blooded animals [36]. Even if E. coli will remain alive in nature, it does not seem to develop and will finally die [37] . Therefore, natural occurrence is consider ed a sign of faecal contamination [1] . There is proof that E. coli may, nevertheless, remain alive and multiply in tropical environments and so its value as an indic a- tion of faecal contamination in such regions is less certain [38] [39] . E. coli possesses significance in water bacteriology since it supplies a helpful sign of faecal infection and not on account of its intrinsic pathogenicity [40]. The philosophy is that, if E. coli is there, then possibly so could other pathogenic enteric microorganisms [41] [42]. Regardless of worries about the accuracy of E. coli as a sign of water safety, it remains the sole species that almost all routine samples are tested for [1] [43] [44] . Situations of E. coli pollution linked with infected under -treated water, and especially public potable water, have been communicated [45] [46] [47]. Cont a- minated cattle on farms are suspected to engender water infection with E. coli [48] [49] and irrigation water has been announced to be a pollution origin [50] . Researchers [51] established that E. coli O157: H7 was apt to remain alive for prolonged times in commercially bottled mineral water. As an illustration, after seeding water with 103 E. coli O157: H7 cells/mL and storing samples at 15C, about 70 days passed before E. coli was not detectable in non- sterile mineral w a- ter, 49 days in sterile mineral water and 21 days in sterile distilled deionized w a- ter. Scientists [52] investigated subsistence of E. coli O157: H 7 in well water m i- crocosms utilizing water implied in a waterborne outbreak. Subsistence of the outbreak strain was similar to a wild -type E. coli strain under the identical cir- cumstances. E. coli 0157 has been found in well water from four different sites in Scotland, UK [53] . Water samples were seeded wi th a lux -marked E. coli O157: H7 strain and stored at 15C. Following the water type, such microbes can be observed by culture for at least 65 days (end of monitoring) [1] . 4.1. Subsistence in Water and Epidemiology All enterovirulent E. coli are obtained directly or indirectly from human or ani- mal carriers [1] . Danger from potable water, for that reason, only follows faecal pollution of the supply. Considering the vulnerability of E. coli to Cl2 and other killing agents, even if the microbes infect the supply, sufficient chlorination as a rule efficiently eliminates any health hazard [54] . There are no standards for E. coli 0157 (EHEC) inside the 1980 European D. Ghernaout et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108860 10 Open Access Library Journal Drinking Water Inspectorate Directive [1] . In 1997, the Environment Group of the previous Scottish Office of Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Depar t- ment auth orized the Water Research Council to assume an investigation inspe ct- ing present proof for waterborne transmission of E. coli 0157 [1]. Such invest i- gation concluded that there was no proof that E. coli 0157 was more enduring in nature or more reluctant to water treatment technologies contrasted with non - pathogenic E. coli detected in the human gastrointestinal tract [1] . Worries subsist concerning the possible part that biofilms play in saving e n- terovirulent E. coli. The very elevated infectious injections needed for all enter o- virulent E. coli, other than EH EC, propose that such potential pathway of tr ans- mission is improbable as a hazard. The lower infectious injection of EHEC dose possi bly augment s the danger of contamination from biofilms in water; however, there have been no epidemics or occasional cases of EHEC involved with ad e- quately disinfected water supplies [1] . Fresh investigation has proved that E. coli may persist in aquatic enviro n- ments, even if the elements that participat e in subsisten ce are not well grasped. Higher predominance of E. coli 0157 has surely been observed throughout war mer periods [55]. Recreational water exposure, comprising use of swimming pools, has been implied as an origin of E. coli O157: H7 [25] [56], yet details concer n- ing E. coli O157: H7 in natural waters and potable water stays restricted, which is mainly related to the reality tha t frequently only small levels (below the sens i- tivity limits of detection) of such bacterium take place [1] . In the Netherlands, E. coli O157 was isolated (employing a particular enric h- ment procedure) in 2.7% of 144 private wells, regardless of such samples satisfy- ing the requested potable water standards [57]. In Canada, after a 2 -year inve s- tigation realized in the Oldman River watershed, 0.9% of surface water samples (n = 1483) were infected with E. coli O157: H7 [49]. In river water, E. coli O157: H7 has as well been isolated from the Oldman River Basin in Southern Alberta, Canada [58]. E. coli O157 was detected in 33 surface water samples in Baltimore, USA. Nonetheless, E. coli 0157 was only observed in low levels of <1 cells per 100 mL of raw water [59] . 4.2. Enterotoxigenic (ETEC) Person to person diffusion of ETEC seems to be scarce and most diffusion of occasional illness is via food and water sources [1] . Because of ETEC, numerous waterborne outbreaks have been registered. One very huge outbreak touched more than 2000 staff and visitors to an American National Park in Oregon in the summ er of 1975 [60] . ETEC were separated from 20 (16.7%) of 120 rectal swabs inspected. There was a strong association between disease and potable park w a- ter in park staff and visitors (p < 0.00001). The only group in which there was no correlation with potable water was one comprising visitors on 7 -9 July 1975, when chlorination of the water supply was carefully supervised. Water came from a shallow spring that was pol luted by a sewage overflow some 650 m uphill from the spring. The supply was assumed to be chlorinated; however, there was D. Ghernaout et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108860 11 Open Access Library Journal no methodical control of Cl2 concentrations throughout the distribution system. Different known outbreak touched 251 passengers and 5 1 crew on a Mediterr a- nean cruise [61] . ETEC was separated from 13 of 22 passengers and 6 of 13 crew sampled. Faecal coliforms were separated from tap water and pot able tap water was the single hazard element related to disease in a case -control study. There were numerous disorders in the ship 's water system, comprising probable mal- functioning chlorination and malfunctioning includes letting bilge water into the wate r containers. Researchers [62] notified three outbreaks of ETEC contamina- tion linked with cruise ships. All three outbreaks were related to consuming drinks with ice cubes on board the ship and two were as well linked with potable unbottled water. Water bunkered in overseas ports was the probable origin of the pollution and this water should be treated before usage [1] . 4.3. Enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) EHEC are observed in the intestines of numerous animal species, comprising cattle [1]. Contamination of persons may go after direct faecal -oral diffusion from infected animals or other persons, or be linked with pollution of food or water. Several outbreaks have pursued the co nsumption of beef products, esp e- cially undercooked beef burgers or salad products. Numerous outbreaks of EH EC related to recreational water contact and consuming drinking water have been reported. Serotype O157: H7 stays the most regularly announced EHEC strain in Europe and North America and the single strain related to outbreaks of potable water -related illness. Nonetheless, EHEC strains other than O157 are more and more being seen as reasons for outbreaks due to foodborne and person -to- person transmissi on [1] . The first outbreak of contamination related to E. coli O157: H7, which was robustly associate d with the consumption of potable water, took place in Bu r- dine Township (Missouri, USA) between 15 December 1989 and 20 January 1990 [46]. Of a population of 3126, a total of 243 persons developed illness and of these, 86 developed bloody diarrhoea, 36 were hospitalized and four died [1] . In a case -control investigation founded on 53 cases, the sole crucial element was that contaminated persons drank more cups of urban water per day than other persons. The water supply to the city came from two deep -ground water sources, and two major wat er breaks took place on the 23 and 26 December, following the begin ning of the outbreak, yet prior to its principal p eak. 4.4. Enteroinvasive (EIEC) Most sickness is suggested to be food - or waterborne, even if individual to ind i- vidual diffusion as well happens. Nonetheless, at most one outbreak of invasive EIEC because water has been noticed in the literature and this was some 50 years ago [1] . 5. Antimicrobial Monitoring For E. coli 0157, the concentrations of chlorine (Cl2) usually observed in water D. Ghernaout et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108860 12 Open Access Library Journal have been proved to be enough for its demobilization [63] [64]. Nonetheless, r e- searchers [65] found that Cl2 (5 mg/L) and ozone (O3) at (22 - 24 mg/L) possess modest killing impact on E. coli O157: H7 [1] . Cheswick et al. [66] examined the performance of Cl2 disinfection for the first time over a range of disinfection conditions employing flow cytometry to fu r- nish new insights into disinfection methods. Demobilization was followed for pure culture bacteria ( E. coli) and pathogens in real treated water from oper a- tional water treatment works (WTWs). A dose dependent increase in demobil i- zation rate ( k) was noted for both test matrices, with values of 0.03 - 0.26 and 0.32 - 3.14 L/mg min for the WTW bacteria and E. coli, respectively. Following 2 min, E. coli was decreased by 2 log for all Cl2 doses (0.12 - 1.00 mg/L). For the WTW filtrate microbes, following 2 min log reductions were between 0.54 and 1.14 with augmenting Cl2 injection, reaching between 1.32 and 2.33 after 30 min. A reduction in disinfection performance was detected as temperat ure decreased from 19C to 5C for both microbial populations. Concerning chlorination at varying pH (pH 6, 7, 8), membrane demolition was more significant at higher pH. This was not consistent with the higher disinfection performance observed at lower pH when culture based methods are utilized to estimate microbial r e- ductions [66] . With chloramines, E. coli H7 is possess a CT level ( C = dis- infectant concentration (mg/L); T = time in min) of around 9.2 mg -min/L. Such value is required to reach a 4 log10 degree of demobilization [67] . Elevated te m- peratures have been proved to be efficient in killing E. coli [68] [69]. Regardless of this, EHEC has been observed to be fit to develop across a wide temperature span [1] . Radiofrequency power and UV light subjection have been notified to block E. coli [70]. Scientists [71] depicted that at 12 J/m2, a 6-log reduction in culturabi l- ity of E. coli O157: H7 happened. Nonetheless, resistant strains of E. coli O25: K98: NM requested bigger degrees of UV light for demobilization [1] . Researchers [72] tested potential merits of consecutive disinfection to domi- nate E. coli under cir cumstances of potable water distribution systems. They treated biofilms developed in polycarbonate and cast -iron reactors with Cl2, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and monochloramine single or in integration with UV. Most important killing took place with the inte gration treatments with UV. Most importantly, chloramine was proved to be efficient in neutralizing E. coli in the effluent, yet not in the biofilm. The influence of Cl2 on the growth phase of E. coli, in matter of its vulnerability to Cl2, has established Cl2 to be less pe r- formant when E. coli is in the stationary phase (juxtaposed with initial lag and exponential growth phase). This has been considered as a significant thought in wastewater treatment technique with changing solids retention times [1] [73] . The growing demand to decrease Cl2 use and dominate (DBPs) augmented the search of fresh procedures in wastewater disinfection. For example, organic peracids are more and more attracting attention in killing pathogens as an e n- couraging alternative to Cl2 and Cl2-founded chemicals. eva-D. Ghernaout al. 10.4236/oalib.1108860 13 Open Access Library Journal luated the antimicrobial characteristics towards E. coli and Staphylococcus au- reus of a fresh organic peracid, permaleic acid (PMA) the refe r- ence peracetic acid (PAA). PMA presented a 10 and 5 -fold reduction in the mi- crobial inhibitory concentration level toward E. coli and S. aureus respectively, juxtaposed to PAA. Trials demonstrated higher performance of PMA concer n- ing wastewater and treated wastewater di sinfection at low dosages. PMA was more performant than PAA to avoid the regrowth of planktonic cells of S. au- reus and E. coli. Therefore, PMA may be utilized as a potential alternative to the presently employed disinfection agents [74] . Even if pulsed UV (PUV) technique is adopted commercially for disinfection inside the food packaging industry, it is not used in the water/wastewater field [75]. Fitzhenry et al. [75] estimated the performance of PUV for disinfecting water disinfection below flow -through conditions. They employed E. coli, S. au- reus and Listeria innocua to examine the capacity for photoreac tivation and/or dark repair post PUV flow -through disinfection. Bacterial demobilization via flow-through PUV is a function of energy output with E. coli showing greatest sensitivity to PUV application (5.3 log10 demobilization following application at 1539 mJ/cm2, output in UV range < 300 nm); L. innocua presented the highest PUV resistance (3.0 log10 demobilization following application at 1539 mJ/cm2, output in UV range < 300 nm) below identical treatment circumstances. Greater photoreactivation took place at lower PUV outputs for both S. aureus and E. coli following flow -through PUV treatment. Therefore, exposure of inactivated ba c- teria to natural light, immediately post flow -through PUV treatment, must be averted to decrease photoreactivation. The LPUV proved demobilization of all microbes below the limit of detection (1 colony -forming unit (CFU)/mL) and inhibited the presence of photoreactivation. He et al. [76] suggested a solar -light -driven magnetic photocatalyst, reduced - graphene -oxide/Fe,N -TiO2/Fe3O4@SiO2 (RGOFeNTFS), for the photocatalytic dis - infection of various strains of bacteria: gram- negative E. coli and Salmonella ty- phimurium , gram -positive Enterococcus faecalis (Figure 2 ). Gram -positive E. faecalis was observed to be more vulnerable to photocatalytic disinfection and showed a higher leakage of intracellular components than the two gram- negative bacteria. The interactions between the bacteria and RGOFeNTFS were examined for Zeta potential, hydrophilic ity and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The opposite surface charges of the bacteria (negative Zeta potential) and RGOFeNTFS (positive Zeta potential) contribute to their interactions. With a more negative Zeta potential (than E. coli and E. faecalis ), S. typhimurium interacts more str ong- ly with RGOFeNTFS and is mostly attacked by OH near the photocatalyst su r- face. With less negative Zeta potentials, E. coli and E. faecalis interact less strongly with RGOFeNTFS, and compete for the dominant reactive sp ecies ( 2O) in the bulk solution. Thus, the co -existence of bacteria significantly inhibits the phot ocatalytic disinfection of E. coli and E. faecalis , but insignificantly for S. ty- phimurium . Furthermore, employing RGOFeNTFS is D. Ghernaout et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108860 14 Open Access Library Journal Figure 2.

Suggesting narrow -band mercury -free light sources, like light emitting dio- des (LEDs) and excilamps, has motivated investigation on killing pathogens via dual-wavelength light radiation [77] . Indeed, dual -wavelength light radiation is considered as a developed instrument for improving microbial demobilization in water in view of potential synergistic e ffect. Matafonova and Batoev [77] focused on its pathways under dual -wavelength light exposure and discussed some r e- lated references in terms of yes -or-no synergy. They suggested three fund a- mental demobilization pathways, which work in the estimated spectrum ranges I (190 - 254 nm), II (250 - 320 nm) and III (300 - 405 nm) and furnish a synergistic effect when combined. Such pathways implicate proteins damage and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair suppression (I), direct and indirect DNA damage (II) and generation of ROSs via endogenous photosensitizers (III), like porphyrins and flavins ( Figure 3 ). A synergy under dual -wavelength light i r- radiation simultaneously or sequentially takes place if coupling two wavelengths of different ranges (I + II, I + III, II + III) in order to trigger various demobil i- zation pathways. New progresses of dual -wavelength light strategy in phot o- dynamic therapy can be applied for water disinfection. They open perspectives for using the sources of near -UV and visible radiation and making the disinfe c- tion techniques more energy- and cost -effective. In such context, the synergisti- cally efficient dual -wavelength combinations II + III and the combinations within the extended to 700 nm range III (near -UV + VIS) seem to be encouraging for D.

PPRI = photo -produced reactive interm e- diates [77]. developing fresh advanced oxidation processes for disinfection of real turbid waters [77] . In rural communities, developing communities with low quality centralized water distribution, portable water purification devices are requested to furnish potable water. As mentioned above, filtration, UV light, or chemical injections present tools to eliminate microorganisms from water. Montenegro -Ayo et al. [78] suggested a small portable photoelectric point -of-use device that uses a co m- mercial teacup from which TiO2 nanotube photoanodes were formed in-situ. With a small rechargeable battery powered 365 nm LED, the apparatus was found to reach 5 -log demobilization of E. coli in 10 s and 2.6 -log of Legionella in 60 s of treatment in model water samples ( Figure 4 ). Dealing with natural water attained a 1 -log bacteria demobilization a fter 30 s thanks to matrix effects. For killing pathogens, hydrodynamic cavitation seems to be an encouraging technology. Sun et al. [79] investigated the disinfection properties of an advan ced hydrodynamic cavitation reactor (ARHCR) in pilot scale. They examined the i m- pacts of different flow rates (1.4 - 2.6 m3/h) and rotational speeds (2600 - 4200 rpm) on killing E. coli. A disinfection rate of 100% was attained in only 4 min for 15 L of simulated effluent under 4200 rpm and 1.4 m3/h, with energy eff i- ciency at 0.0499 kWh/L. The morphological changes in E. coli were studied by SEM ( Figure 5 ). The ARHCR may conduct to serious cleavage and surface da m- ages to E. coli. They suggested a likely damage route of the ARHCR, comprising both the hydrodynamical and sonochemical impacts ( Figure 6 ). D. Ghernaout et al.

Antibiotic -resistant bacteria (ARB) form a dangerous threat to public health [80]. As a low energy consumption and environmentally -friendly technology, electrochemistry seems to be appropriate for killing ARB. Liu et al. [80] invest i- gated the suitability of electrochemical disinfection (ED) for demobilizing ARB (E. coli K-12 LE392 resistant to kanamycin, tetracycline, and ampicillin) and the regrowth probability of the treated ARB. T hey depicted that 5.12 -log ARB redu c- tion was reached within 30 min of applying molybdenum carbide as the anode D. Ghernaout et al.

No ARB regrowth was noted in the cathode chamber after 60 min of incubation in unselective broth, showing that the technique in the cathode ch amber was more efficient in demobilizing ARB permanently. The pathways underlying the ARB demobilization were ver i- fied founded on intercellular ROSs measurement, membrane integrity detection, and genetic damage assessment. Higher ROSs generation and membrane pe r- meability were detected in the cathode and anode groups ( p < 0.001) compared to the control group (0 V). Furthermore, the DNA was more likely to be da m- aged throughout the ED application. Such investigation establishes once again that ED is an encouraging process for disinfecting water to avert the diffusion of ARB (Figure 7 ). Xia et al. [81] presented a new process founded on piezoelectric catalytic per- sulfate (PS) activation for water advanced disinfection. They synthesized and used silver modified barium titanate (Ag -BTO) as a piezoelectric catalyst to a c- tivate PS under ultrasonic (US) vibr ation for demobilizing E. coli. The suggested US/Ag -BTO/PS method reached a 6.2 log demobilization within 5 min and 20 min, respectively, for E. coli at culturable state and viable but nonculturable state (Figure 8 ). The important perfo rmance o f E. coli reduction was related to the successive formation of hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals via PS activation by piezo -catalytically formed electrons and superoxide radicals. A synergism between ultrasonication and radical oxidation was o bserved by employing the D. Ghernaout et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108860 18 Open Access Library Journal Figure 7.

Extraintestinal E. coli contagions are, yet, treated with antibiotics. If such procedure of treatment is used, it must be admitted that E. coli reveal i n- D. Ghernaout et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108860 19 Open Access Library Journal trinsic resistance to benzylpenicillin. E. coli remain usually vulnerable to the a n- tibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim and the c e- phalosporins). Nonetheless, due to the broad diffusion proof of antibiotic resi s- tance being acquired by plasmid transfer, there is gr owing numbers of E. coli re- sistant to streptomycin and tetracycline. For such cause, antibiograms must be realized, mostly for epidemiological objectives. Employing antibiotics in dealing with E. coli 0157 remains controversial because of the trouble of gr owing nu m- bers of E. coli 0157 with antibiotic resistance. Most important is the augmenting propagation of extended -spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli [82]. ESBL generating E. coli show resistance to the majority of the b-lactam antibi o- tics, comprising penicillins, monobactams and most cephalosporins. The expl a- nation for this stays the occurrenc e of plasmid -encoded enzymes, which hydr o- lyze the -lactam antibiotics [1]. Such microbes are more and more involved in provoking hospital , as well as community -acquired contagions and when exis t- ing, tend to be treated with carbapenems, since these remain active against many ESBL -E. coli [83]. However, resistance of E. coli to carbapenems is as well as emerging [84] [85] [86] . Antibiotics that have historically been active against E. coli have comprised sulfonamides, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides (comprising Notwith- standing all such antibiotics being standard therapies for E. coli, there has been much worry concerning the fast expansion of resistance [89] [90]. Fundamental pathways of resistance against such antibiotics have comprised exclusion and e f- flux of the agents from the bacterial cell, acquisition of resistance genes co m- prising those that g enerate enzymes fit to decompose -lactamas, es, decompose recent analogues of cephalosp o- rins. It has been assessed in the UK that of all 10% of E. coli bacteraemias are linked with ESBL strains and 90% of these are CTX- M type [91] . Relating to antibiotic resistance amongst environmental isolates, scientists [92] fixed the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 241 E. coli isolates recuperated from water, sediment and biofilms in an intensive agricultural watershed (Elk Creek, British Columbia, Canada) between 2005 and 2007. Such isolates had an elevated frequency of resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, streptomycin and n a- lidixic acid [1] . 6. Conclusion s This work firstly defined microbiologically E. coli bacteria and presented a brief history relating to their first discovery and following contagions. To understand E. coli's behavior, a short description relating to their metabolism and physiol o- gy is given. As humankind is concerned by E. coli contagion, their clinical ch a- racteristics are discussed besides their subsistence in nature. A general examin a-D. Ghernaout et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108860 20 Open Access Library Journal tion concerning different techniques used for controlling such bacteria is finally presented. The main points drawn from this work may be listed as below: 1) In terms of health effects ( i.e., the occurrence of disease, degree of morbi d- ity and mortality): a) the pathogenic E. coli serotypes are categorized following their route of producing symptoms (The contagious dose of most pathogenic E. coli is elevated, r anging from 105 to 1010 organisms) [1]. b) c) All pathogenic E. coli provoke diarrhe a at different levels of gravity. d) EPEC: traveler 's diarrhoea, enteritis in infants; syndrome (HU S); diffusely adherent: diarrhoea children. e) E. coli induces urinary tract infections (UTIs) and may provoke sepsis and meningitis in neonates. f) Pathogenic E. coli strains lead to the majority of childhood diarrhoea. g) The level of morbidity and mo r- tality changes following the strain and the host 's properties. In poor countries, diarrhoeal illness is much more probably to conduct to the dangerous disease and death. In rich countries, even if childhood diarrhoea is less serious, cont a- gion with verocytotoxigenic E. coli may lead to HUS and thrombiotic thrombo - cytopaenia purpura. Such circumstances could create acute kidney failure and death [ 1]. 2) Conventional water treatments employ high energy -intense mercury lamps or chlorine injection, which remain neither a feasible nor economically viable methods for vulnerable populati ons in developing areas [78] . Such competitive techniques may be overcome by a more affordable and off- grid method like a device that is founded on TiO2 photoelectrocatalytic disinfection concepts. A p- plying photoelectr ocatalytic processes in scaled -down and portable devices au- thorize s performant water disinfection when using an off -grid point -of-use sy s- tem. Employing LED sources guarantees working with low energy consumption. This furnishes interesting alternatives to traditional disinfection treatments [78] . 3) A pilot -scale ARHCR was tested for water disinfection, and a new probable disinfection route of the ARHCR was proposed co mprising hydrodynamical and sonochemical effects. The ARHCR could be used as an encouraging alternative or complementary tool for water disinfection as well as other process intensific a- tions. More research on the disinfection route, structural optimization , and scale up remains required in the fu ture [79] .
