It is a great pleasure for me to join you today in the annual conference of Danish Energy and Danish District Heating Association. I would like to take this good opportunity to brief you about China's energy resource situation and basic thinking of energy development. As we all know, energy security and its environmental impact has become a global focal point. There are three main challenges: the first is the short supply of energy. The consumption of energy is increasing continuously along with the global economic development and has intensified the tense of energy supply. The second is the unbalanced energy structure. There is still a long way to go before renewable energy resources and other alternative energy can completely replace fossil fuels which are heading fast for exhaustion. The third is the emission of greenhouse gasses in the course of using fossil fuels. The international community has reached common consensus on easing the climate change and successfully taken a series of cooperative steps based on the principles in the \"United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\", \" [Kyoto](app:ds:Kyoto) [Protocol](app:ds:Protocol)\" and \"The Copenhagen Accord\". Confronted with the tough challenges, Chinese government has joined the international community in the great efforts on guaranteeing energy security and easing environmental impact. I would like to elaborate in three aspects. In the beginning, I would like to introduce the basic energy situation in China. In 2009, the total energy consumption in China reached 3.7 billion tons of standard coal, in which coal accounted for 68.7%, oil 18%, natural gas 3.4%, non-fossil fuels 9.9%. [Hydroelectric](app:ds:hydroelectric) and nuclear power takes up most of the non-fossil fuel consumption. In 2010, the total consumption of non-fossil fuels in China was 260 million tons of standard coal, in which hydroelectric accounted for 210 million tons, nuclear power 20 million tons and other renewable energy 30 million tons. China is pushing forward vigorously a series of policies and measures on energy saving and emission reduction. Through restructuring of industry and eliminating of backward production capacity, the increase speed of total energy consumption is obviously getting lower. From 2006 to 2010, the year-on-year growths of China's energy consumption are 9.6%, 7.8%, 4%, 6.3% and 5.9% respectively. In the meantime, growth rates of GDP are 12.7%, 14.2%, 9.6%, 9.2% and 10.4%. Over the past five years, China supported an average of 11.2% GDP growth rate by an average of 6.7% growth rate in energy consumption. In 2009, the energy self-supply rate of China reached 91.3% and the energy consumption per capita is 1.61 tons of standard oil, one fifth of the consumption of the United States'. In 2010, the energy intensity of China had been raised by 19.1% since 2005. It is undeniable that China's energy security is confronted with serious challenges. Take the problem of unbalanced energy structure as an example: the remarkable characteristics are rich in coal, lack of oil and natural gas. China contributes 45% of the world's total coal production which accounts for 70% of our energy consumption. Although we can see decrease in the energy consumption per unit of GDP, according to the estimate of related institutions, it is still 3 times as much as the United States' and 5 times as much as Japan's. So we are still far behind those developed countries in this respect. Then, after the overall introduction of China's energy situation, I would like to elaborate on several questions. In recent years, along with China's rapid economic development and expansion of energy demand, we are receiving more and more attention from all over the world. We sincerely welcome all the concerns and reasonable suggestions. Meanwhile, there are a few questions I need to clarify. The first question is that if China has become NO.1 in terms of total energy consumption in the whole world. According to the estimate of International Energy Agency in 2009, China, with its 2.265 billion tons of standard oil consumption, had surpassed the U.S. with 2.17 billion tons and become NO.1 in terms of total energy consumption in the world. China's National Energy Administration clearly denied the statement and pointed out that the result would be different if calculated by \"standard coal\" instead of \"standard oil\". Honestly, it is not surprising that China, as a developing country with the largest population, is consuming more and more energy for the sake of economic development and improvement of people's living standard. It is not surprising even if China becomes NO.1 in the world's total energy consumption someday in the future. However, in our opinion, the hasty label on China as NO.1 energy consuming country, on one hand, is to spur our pace of energy saving and emission reduction. On the other hand, I have to say that it demonstrates a kind of intention to shift the blame to China for the severe global energy situation. The second question is that if China is to blame for the worldwide short energy supply and the rise in energy prices. In recent years, the energy self-supply rate of China remains above 90% while only 8% of energy supply relies on import. We can easily tell from the fluctuation of oil price these years that as one of the engines of world economy, China's economy is growing rapidly without bringing fundamental influence to the balance of global energy supply and demand. A few years ago, many people blamed China for the fact that the international crude oil prices rose from 70 U.S.D to 145 U.S.D. a barrel. From then on, China's oil import was continuously increasing and reached 239 million tons in 2010 with 17% of year-on-year growth, becoming the second largest oil importer and consumer. But during the same period, the international crude oil prices once fell from 140 USD to 36 USD a barrel and remained in a turbulent state. Last year, the International Energy Agency deliberately featured in a special chapter in \"World Energy Outlook\" that \"do not exaggerate the importance of China in global energy market\". The third question is if China is trying not to take its responsibility in the course of dealing with global climate change. The problem of climate change is fundamentally an environmental and development problem. As a developing country whose per capita income ranks after the 100th in the world. China needs to speed up its industrialization and urbanization. It should be understandable to see a continuous increase in energy consumption during China's course of economic development and improvement of people's living standard. At the same time, China gives high priority to the problem of emission and actively involves in dealing with climate change, regarding it vital to the future of the nation and all mankind. From actual national conditions and total emission amount in the past, according to the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibility\", China has set the target of a 40-45% decrease in 2020 in carbon emissions per unit of GDP compared with that of 2005. It is not an easy task for a nation in rising stage. As the expert from Stanford University's Program on Energy and Sustainable Development, Mr. Richard Morse said, China is more courageous than any other country to raise such a five-year plan, setting such an ambitious target. In fact, China is making tremendous efforts even if the speed of emission reduction remains as it is now. Finally, I would like to introduce to you the trend of energy development in China. China has been taking the problem of fast growing energy consumption seriously, viewing it as one big challenge for social and economic development. On one hand, we focus on improving energy efficiency and advocating energy saving; on the other hand, we unswervingly advance the course of emission reduction by actively optimizing energy consumption structure and developing renewable energy. We have gained some successes especially in the development and apply of new energy technologies. In order to carry out the 12th Five-Year Plan, China's National Energy Administration is initiating on the 12th Five-Year Plan of energy, coordinating the healthy development of energy industry. China is working hard to slow down the total energy consumption by improving the concentration of traditional mine industry, shutting down energy-consuming small power plants, designing updated energy-efficient appliance and so on. It is planned that in 2015, the total domestic energy consumption is about 4 billion tons of standard coal with an annual increase rate than 4.8%. In China, new energy industry has been listed among the seven strategic industries, enjoying primary support from the government. The development of clean energy is promoted by the means of policy mandate, financial subsidies, and tax adjustment and so on. At present, China enjoys 4 world's \"no.1\" in the total quantity of electricity from hydroelectric stations, in the scale of use of solar water heater, in the scale of nuclear power plant under construction and in the increase speed of wind power installed capacity. It is estimated that in 2015, the consumption of non-fossil fuels will account for 11.5% of the total consumption and reach 15% in 2020. By raising energy efficiency, developing non-fossil fuels and other steps, China has realized the target of 19.1% of decrease in energy consumption per unit of GDP in 2010 compared with that of 2005. It is estimated that there will be another decrease of 17.3% in 2015 and 16.6% in 2020. Dear guests, We believe that the problem of energy is a global challenge confronting all nations. The demand for energy and bearing capacity varies for nations in different stages development. The international community should face up to the issue of energy security and environmental problems. We are going nowhere if we depreciate or over-exaggerate its importance, or politicalize the energy problem. It is only by mutual benefited and win-win cooperation based on healthy competition that we can communicate and deal with it. "}
