See EZIZ job aid: Receiving & Storing Pfizer Vaccines (eziz.org) Controlant Onsite Monitoring Playbook 45SAGA Digital Data Logger Issues -Pfizer Shippers Quality Reporting Once you open your shipper, press and hold the stop button on the logger for five seconds to stop temperature monitoring. A Quality Report should be provided via email within 1 -3 hours. Do not use the vaccine within this shipper until you receive the quality report from Controlant advising on further use. Manual Upload Instructions If the temperature monitoring device is unable to connect with the cell network, please follow the steps below. These steps allow Points of Use (POUs) to ensure proper data connection through a manual data upload using your local internet network. The manual data process steps are the same for both Controlant 10.01 and/or Controlant SAGA loggers. 46SAGA Digital Data Logger Issues (continued) Step 1. Connect the temperature monitoring device to a computer that has access to your local network using the USB cable provided with the temperature monitoring device. Manually upload the temperature monitoring data onto the computer. Step 2. The data file will upload onto the computer in the form of a .bin file . Once you have located the .bin file on your computer, please manually upload this file to https://upload.controlant.com/ . Manually uploading the data to this website allows the data from the temperature monitoring device to reach the Pfizer Control Tower which helps to ensure supply chain visibility. Step 3. Once the data is received at the Control Tower, a quality disposition report is created which documents quality considerations and identifies any suspected nonconforming items.
