However, these employ - ers are permitted to elect to exempt a plan from the requirements listed below for any part of the plan that is \"self-funded\" by the employer, rather than provided through a health insurance policy. PEIA has elected to exempt the PEIA PPB Plans from item two of the following requirements: 1. Protection against limiting hospital stays in connection with the birth of a child to less than 48 hours for a vaginal delivery, and 96 hours for a cesarean section. 2. Protections against having benefits for mental health and substance-use disorders be subject to more restrictions than apply to medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan. 3. Certain requirements to provide benefits for breast reconstruction after a mastectomy . 4. Continued coverage for up to one year for a dependent child who is covered as a dependent under the plan solely based on student status, who takes a medically necessary leave of ab - sence from a postsecondary educational institution. The exemption from these federal requirements will be in effect for the 2023 plan year , beginning July 1, 2022 and ending June 30, 2023. The election may be renewed for subsequent plan years. Medicare Part D Notice If you (and/or your covered dependents) have Medicare or will become eligible for Medicare in the next 12 months, a Federal law gives you more choices about your prescription drug coverage.

This booklet describes the benefits provided for PEIA insureds in the PEIA PPB Plans A, B and D for Plan Year 2023 (July 1, 2022 - June 30, 2023). It includes important information for all public employees who have ANY coverage through PEIA. PEIA also offers PPB Plan C, which is an IRS-qualified High- Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). For information about Plan C, download the Summary Plan Description (Plan C) at peia.wv.gov or call 1-888-680-7342 . Managed Care Members For those who are enrolled in managed care plans, this booklet provides all the eligibility and enrollment information regarding your benefits. If you need or want to change your benefits, please refer to the information in the beginning of this booklet for details of your rights, re - sponsibilities, and the timeframes for making eligibility changes. Information in this booklet regarding managed care plan benefits and guidelines is limited. Therefore, you should refer to your managed care Evidence of Coverage for benefit details if you are covered by one of the managed care plans offered by PEIA. PPB Plan Participants For those enrolled in the PEIA PPB Plans A, B and D, this booklet includes many details of the Preferred Provider Benefit (PPB) Plans. It is important to review this information close - ly so that you may familiarize yourself with all aspects of PEIA's PPB Plans. Please keep this booklet close at hand and refer to it often if you have questions about your health care benefits. This Summary Plan Description (SPD) provides PEIA PPB Plan participants with an easy-to- read description of benefits available through the Plans and instructions on how to use these benefits. The SPD is a summarized version of a portion of PEIA's Plan Document. The Plan Document describes, in detail, all aspects of the operations of the Agency, and is on file with the Secretary of State. PEIA contracts with third party administrators (TPAs) to process health and drug claims for the PEIA PPB Plans. If you have a question about a specific claim or benefit, the fastest way to obtain information is contact the TPA directly at one of the numbers listed on the next page. PEIA PPB Plan A is PEIA's most popular plan. PEIA PPB Plan B is similar to the standard PPB Plan A, but offers lower premiums with higher deductibles, higher out-of-pocket max - imums, a greater coinsurance requirement, and higher copayments for prescription drugs. The medical coverage is the same as in PPB Plan A. PEIA PPB Plan C is PEIA's IRS- qualified High Deductible Health Plan, and the details of Plan C are covered in the Summary Plan Description - Plan C, which is available at peia.wv.gov or by calling 1-888-680-7342 . Plan D is the West Virginia ONLY plan whose benefits mirror those of Plan A, but with no out- of-state benefits except for medical emergencies and a few services that are not available within WV. Medicare-primary Members For most Medicare-eligible retired employees and Medicare-eligible dependents of retired employees, PEIA has a contract with Humana to provide medical and prescription drug ben - efits. Information in this booklet regarding benefits for Medicare retirees is very limited. You should refer to your Humana Evidence of Coverage booklet for benefit details. Each eligible member has received detailed information about the plan from Humana. If you have ques - tions, please use the numbers on the back of your Humana ID card to obtain answers.2 Life Insurance Only For employees who carry only life insurance with PEIA, your eligibility and enrollment de - tails are in this booklet. Details of the life insurance coverage are in the Life Insurance Booklet. For questions about life insurance or to file a life insurance claim, call MetLife at 1-888-466-8640 . Effective July 1, 2022 PEIA will no longer be responsible for the management of beneficiaries of PEIA life insurance policies. The designation of, changes to, and updates of beneficiary information will be the responsibility of the PEIA life insurance vendor, Met Life. Subject to Change The benefit information in this Summary Plan Description is subject to change during the plan year, if circumstances arise which require adjustment. Plan changes will be communicated to participants. The changes will be included in PEIA's Plan Document, which is on file with the Secretary of State, and will be incorporated into the next edition of the Summary Plan Description.

TERMS & DEFINITIONS Affordable Care Act (ACA) Out-of-Pocket Maximum: The Affordable Care Act places a limit on how much you must spend for healthcare in any plan year before your plan starts to pay 100% for covered essential health benefits. This limit includes deductibles (medical and prescription), coinsurance, copayments, or similar charges and any other expenditure re - quired of an individual which is a qualified medical expense for the essential health benefits. This limit does not include premiums, balance billing amounts for non-network providers and other out-of-network cost-sharing or spending for non-essential health benefits. The maximum out-of-pocket cost for Plan Year 2023 can be no more than the rates set by the federal government for individual and family plans. Because PEIA 's plans have out-of- pocket maximums that are substantially lower than the ACA required limits, the ACA out-of- pocket maximum should never come into play for most PEIA PPB Plan members. Allowed Amounts: For each PEIA-covered service, the allowed amount is the lesser of the actual charge amount or the maximum fee for that service as set by the PEIA. Alternate Facility: A facility other than an acute care hospital. Annual Deductible: The amount you must pay each plan year before the plan pays its por - tion of the cost. Under the PPB Plans A, B and D, office visits are not subject to the deduct - ible. Only the Allowed Amounts for covered expenses will be applied to your deductible. The family deductible is divided up among the family members. No one member of the family will pay more than the individual (or Employee Only) deductible. Beacon Recovery Group: The subrogation and recovery vendor for PEIA. Beacon pursues recovery of money paid for claims that were not the responsibility of the PEIA PPB Plans. For more information, read the \"Recovery of Incorrect Payments\" section. Beneficiary: The person who receives the proceeds of your PEIA life insurance policy. Effective July 1, 2022 PEIA will no longer be responsible for the management of beneficiaries of PEIA life insurance policies. The designation of, changes to, and updates of beneficiary information will be the responsibility of the PEIA life insurance vendor, Met Life.4 Complex Condition CARE: A program from UMR to identify catastrophic and complex ill - nesses, transplants, and trauma cases, and work with members to maximize their benefits. Claims Administrator: UMR adjudicates health claims for the PEIA PPB plans. Coinsurance: The percentage of eligible expenses that you are required to pay after the deductible has been met. This is the amount applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. You are responsible for paying the coinsurance and deductible amounts directly to the provider of services. Common Specialty Medications: Self-administered specialty drugs that are provided through the Express Scripts Accredo Specialty Pharmacy. All Specialty medications require prior authorization. Comprehensive Care Partnership (CCP) Program: The CCP program promotes the use of services to keep the patient well, identify health problems early, maintain control of chronic conditions and to promote efficient utilization of healthcare resources. The CCP provider is responsible for preventative services, routine sick care, and coordination of care with spe - cialists when needed. Members that are in the CCP program pay less for specified services at their CCP provider. Insureds enrolled in PEIA PPB Plan C or who have Medicare as their primary coverage are not eligible in the CCP program. Coordination of Benefits: A practice insurance companies use to avoid double or duplicate payments or coverage of service when a person is covered by more than one policy. Copayment: This is the set dollar amount that you pay when you use the services\u2014like the flat dollar amount you pay for an office visit in PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D. Copayments do not count toward your annual out-of-pocket maximum or your annual deductible. Deductible: The amount of eligible expenses you are required to pay before the plan be - gins to pay benefits. The deductible does not apply to charges for office visits. See Annual Deductible above. Dependent: An eligible person, under PEIA guidelines, who the policyholder has properly enrolled for coverage under the Plan. Ongoing Condition CARE: A program from UMR to identify individuals who have certain chronic diseases and would benefit from working with specially trained nurses to manage those chronic diseases and maintain quality of life. Durable Medical Equipment: Medical equipment that is prescribed by a physician which can withstand repeated use, is not disposable, is used for a medical purpose, and is general - ly not useful to a person who is not sick or injured. Eligible Expense: A necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more plans covering the per - son for whom the claim is made. Allowable expenses under this plan are calculated accord - ing to PEIA fee schedules, rates and payment policies in effect at the time of service. Emergency: A condition that manifests itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity includ - ing severe pain such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in serious jeopardy to the individual's health or with respect to a pregnant woman the health of the unborn child, serious impairment to bodily functions or serious dys - function of a bodily part or organ.5 Employers: PEIA offers its benefits through these West Virginia employers: State government and its agencies; State-related colleges and universities; County boards of education; County and municipal governments; and Other employers as specified in W.Va. Code \u00a75-16-2. Under West Virginia law, different types of employers may offer their employees different benefits. Therefore, the benefits for which you are eligible may vary. If you have any questions about your benefits, contact the benefit coordinator at your payroll location or call the PEIA. Exclusions: Services, treatments, pharmaceuticals, supplies, conditions, or circumstances that are not covered under the PEIA PPB Plans. Experimental, Investigational, or Unproven Procedures: Medical, surgical, diagnostic, psychiatric, substance abuse or other health care technologies, supplies, treatments, proce - dures, drug therapies or devices that are determined by the plan (at the time it makes a de - termination regarding coverage in a particular case) to be: (1) not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be lawfully marketed for the proposed use and not identi - fied in the American Medical Association Drug Evaluations as appropriate for the proposed use; or (2) subject to review and approval by any Institutional Review Board for the proposed use; or (3) the subject of an ongoing clinical trial that is subject to FDA oversight; or (4) not demonstrated through prevailing peer-reviewed medical literature to be safe and effective for treating or diagnosing the condition or illness for which its use is proposed.

This explanation might include the amount paid, benefits available, reasons for denying payment, etc. Express Scripts: PEIA's prescription drug benefit manager (PBM). Express Scripts pro - cesses and pays prescription drug claims and helps manage the prescription drug benefit.

Legal Guardianship: A legal relationship created when a person or institution is named by the Court to take care of minor children. Eligibility for guardianship requires an Order from a Court of record. Notarized documents signed by parents assigning \"guardianship\" are not sufficient to establish eligibility. The term \"guardian\" may also refer to someone who is Court-appointed to care for and/or handle the affairs of a person who is incompetent or incapable of administering his/her affairs. Sometimes a separate person is appointed to handle the financial matters of the child(ren) or the adult and that relationship is called a conservatorship. Maternity CARE: A program from UMR that provides prenatal education and high-risk preg - nancy identification to help mothers carry their babies to term. Medical Out-of-Pocket Maximum: The amount you must spend in coinsurance in any plan year before your plan starts to pay 100% for most covered services. The out-of-pocket max - imum is a running total of coinsurance you pay for services during the plan year. Amounts you pay toward your annual deductibles, for copayments, for precertification penalties, for prescription drugs, for amounts billed in excess of what PEIA pays to non-network providers, and for services that are not covered under the plan do not apply toward your annual medical out-of-pocket maximum. It includes only your medical charges; prescriptions are handled separately. Medicare: The federal program of health benefits for retirees and other qualified individ - uals as established by Title XVII of the Social Security Act of 1965, as amended. Parts A and B provide medical coverage to Medicare Beneficiaries. Retired, qualified Medicare Beneficiaries covered by PEIA are REQUIRED to enroll for both Medicare Part A and Part B.

Non-Resident PPB Plan Participants: A PEIA PPB Plan participant who resides outside WV and beyond the bordering counties.7 Notification: The required process for reporting an inpatient stay to UMR. This process is performed to screen for care planning, discharge planning, follow-up care and ancillary ser - vice requirements. Outpatient: Someone who receives services in a hospital, alternative care facility, free - standing facility, or physician's office but who is not admitted as a bed patient. OOSINNA: Out-of-state (beyond the contiguous counties), in-network, not approved. Services of an out-of-state, in-network provider not approved in advance by UMR are cov - ered at the lower benefit level. The patient is also responsible for double the in-network deductible and double the in-network out-of-pocket maximum. OOSINNA does not apply to non-resident PPB Plan participants. Participant: A policyholder or dependent enrolled in one of the PEIA PPB Plans. PEIA PPB Plan A: The most expensive PEIA PPB Plan offered to all eligible active employ - ees and non-Medicare retirees. PEIA PPB Plan B: A lower-cost PEIA PPB Plan offered to all eligible active employees and most non-Medicare retirees. Plan B offers lower premiums with higher deductibles, higher out-of-pocket maximums, increased coinsurance, and higher copayments for prescription drugs. The medical coverage is the same in Plans A, B and D. The differences in deduct - ibles, out-of-pocket maximums, coinsurance and drug copayments are noted in the tables in the \"What You Pay with the PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D\" section and the \"Prescription Drug Benefit\" section of this book. PEIA PPB Plan C: The IRS-qualified High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) offered by PEIA to all eligible active employees. The plan offers lower premiums, but a high deductible that must be met before the plan begins to pay. The plan is designed to work with either a Health Savings Account (HSA) or a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA). For more informa - tion about PEIA's HDHP, download the Summary Plan Description (Plan C) at peia.wv.gov or call 1-888-680-7342 . PEIA PPB Plan D: PEIA PPB Plan D is the West Virginia ONLY plan. Members enrolling in this plan must be West Virginia residents, and all care provided under this plan must be pro - vided in West Virginia. The benefits (copayments, coinsurance, deductible and out-of-pocket maximum) of Plan D are identical to PEIA PPB Plan A, and the premiums are much lower than Plan A. The difference is that the only care allowed outside the State of West Virginia will be emergency care to stabilize the patient, and a limited number of procedures that are not available from any health care provider inside West Virginia. For policyholders who are West Virginia residents but who have dependents who reside outside West Virginia (such as students attending college out-of-state), PEIA PPB Plan D will cover those out-of-state de - pendents for emergency care to stabilize the patient, and a limited number of procedures that are not available from any health care provider inside West Virginia. All other services must be provided within West Virginia. PEIA PPO: The PEIA PPO is the network of providers from whom PEIA PPB Plan par - ticipants can receive care to get the highest level of benefit. This network consists of all properly licensed WV providers who provide health care services or supplies to any PEIA participant, as well as most out-of-state providers in UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus Preferred Provider Organization.

Prior Authorization: The required process of obtaining authorization from the Rational Drug Therapy Program for coverage for some non-specialty prescription medications and from Express Scripts for some specialty prescription medications under the PEIA PPB Plans. Provider Discount: A previously determined percentage that is deducted from a provider's charge or payment amount and is not billable to the insured when PEIA is the primary payer and the service is provided in West Virginia or by a PPO network provider. Qualifying Event: A qualifying event is a personal change in status which may allow you to change your benefit elections. Examples of qualifying events include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Change in legal marital status - marriage or divorce of policyholder or dependent 2. Change in number of dependents - birth, death, adoption, placement for adoption, award of legal guardianship 3. Change in employment status of the employee's spouse or employee's dependent - switching from part-time to full-time employment status or from full-time to part-time, termination or commencement of employment, a strike or lockout, commencement of or return from an unpaid leave of absence which results in employee/dependent becoming ineligible for coverage 4. Dependent satisfies or ceases to satisfy eligibility requirements If you experience a qualifying event, you have the month in which the event occurs and the two following calendar months to act upon that qualifying event and change your cov - erage. If you do not act within that timeframe, you cannot make the change until the next 9 Open Enrollment. Qualifying events which end eligibility (such as divorce, termination of Guardianship/parental rights, etc. ) must be reported immediately. For purposes of eligibility, the term \"immediately\" shall mean as soon as practically possible and, in no case, greater than thirty (30) days from the date of the event, e.g. divorce. For purposes of this sec - tion, \"Reporting\" means the proper submission of a \"Change in Status\" form to the member 's Employer Agency Benefit Coordinator and/or the proper submission of the Qualifying Event through the PEIA Manage My Benefits Portal with the appropriate supporting documentation, e.g. a copy of the divorce decree, Court Order(s), etc. \"Calling\" and/or e-mailing and inform - ing your participating employer and/or PEIA of an event does not meet the reporting require - ments of this section.

Special Medicare Plan: The Plan created by PEIA to provide benefits to retirees unable to access providers in the Medicare Advantage plan and those retirees who become eligible for Medicare benefits during a plan year. Medical claims under this plan are paid by Medicare first, then by UMR and prescription claims are paid by Express Scripts. The medical benefits are identical to those provided to members of the Humana MAPD plan, including a plan year that runs from January through December. Specialty Injectable Drugs: These are prescription drugs used to treat complex, chronic, or rare medical conditions (e.g., cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, HIV, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and hepatitis). Drugs in this category are typically ad - ministered by injection or infusion. Specialty Injectables often require special handling (e.g., refrigeration) and ongoing clinical monitoring. The PEIA PPB Plans cover specialty injectable drugs through a program managed by UMR. Specialty Medications: Specialty medications are high-cost injectable, infused, oral or in - haled drugs that generally require close supervision and monitoring of the patient' s drug ther - apy. Some specialty medications are covered under the medical benefit and are managed by UMR, and some are covered under the prescription drug benefit and administered by Express Scripts. Those covered under the prescription drug benefit, have a two-tier copay; after meeting your deductible, preferred specialty drugs have a $100 copay , non-preferred specialty drugs have a drugs managed by UMR require 20% coinsurance after deductible. All specialty medications covered under the prescription benefit (oral and self-injectable) require prior authorization through Express Scripts. PEIA will allow a one-time initial fill of the certain specialty medications at a retail pharmacy .10 Third Party Administrator (TPA): A company with which PEIA has contracted to provide services such as customer service, utilization management and claims processing to PEIA PPB Plan participants. UMR: The third-party administrator that handles medical claim processing, Complex Condition CARE, utilization management, precertification, prior approval and customer ser - vice for the PEIA PPB Plans. UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus PPO: PEIA's out-of-state Preferred Provider Network. Not all providers in the UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus PPO network may participate with PEIA. Kings Daughters Medical Center in Kentucky remains out-of-network for PEIA, regardless of their network status with the PPO network. Also, PEIA does not use the PPO network in Washington County, Ohio, or in Boyd County, Kentucky. PEIA reserves the right to remove providers from the network, so not all providers listed in the network may be available to you. Utilization Management: A process by which PEIA controls health costs and saves mon - ey for plan members. Components of utilization management include pre-admission and concurrent review of all inpatient stays, known as precertification; prior review of certain outpatient surgeries and services; and Complex Condition CARE. Utilization management is handled by UMR. Waiver of Premium: If you become disabled before age 60, and while insured, your basic life insurance coverage may continue as long as you are disabled without further payment of premium. To be considered disabled, you must be unable to do any work for pay or prof - it. You must complete an application to continue the basic life with a waiver of premium. An application for waiver of premium must be provided to PEIA's life insurance carrier within 12 months of your last day worked. Contact your benefit coordinator or PEIA to obtain an application. WHAT PEIA OFFERS Health Coverage PEIA offers four PEIA PPB Plans. Read on to see who is eligible to enroll in each plan. 1. Plan A is the most expensive plan available to all eligible enrollees, including active employees and non-Medicare retirees. 2. Plan B offers lower premiums with higher deductibles, higher out-of-pocket maxi - mums, increased coinsurance, and higher copayments for prescription drugs. The medical coverage is identical in PPB Plans A, B & D. Plan B is available to all active employees and to non-Medicare retirees whose dependents do not have Medicare. 3. Plan C is an IRS-qualified High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). For more informa - tion about PEIA's HDHP, download the Summary Plan Description (Plan C) at peia.wv.gov or call 1-888-680-7342 . Plan C is available to active employees only. 4. Plan D is the West Virginia ONLY plan. Insureds enrolling in this plan must be West Virginia residents, and all care provided under this plan must be provided in West Virginia. The only care allowed outside the State of West Virginia will be emergency care to stabilize the patient, and a limited number of procedures that are not available from any health care provider inside West Virginia. The benefits (copayments, coin - surance, deductible and out-of-pocket maximum) of Plan D are identical to PEIA PPB Plan A, but there is no out-of-network coverage, except as noted above. Plan D is available to active employees only.11 If you live in an area where PEIA offers a managed care plan, you may be eligible to enroll in a managed care plan or in the PEIA PPB Plan. You must live in the managed care plan's enrollment area to be eligible to enroll in a plan. Please consult your Shopper 's Guide for information about the managed care plans offered in your area. The PEIA PPB Plans use a coordination of benefits provision that determines how they will pay if you have other health insurance available to you. See page 118 for a complete de - scription of this provision. The PEIA PPB Plans may be of little or no value to you as second - ary insurance on your dependents. Life Insurance As an active or retired employee, you may be eligible for basic decreasing term life insur - ance. This policy includes accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) benefits for active employees only. If you enroll for health benefits as an active employee, you must also enroll for basic life insurance. If you choose not to enroll for health benefits, you may still enroll for basic life insurance. You must enroll for basic life insurance before you elect any of the op - tional life insurance coverages. Eligibility and enrollment details for the life insurance plans are included in this booklet. For a complete description of the life insurance benefits, please see the Life Insurance Booklet. Effective July 1, 2022 PEIA will no longer be responsible for the management of beneficiaries of PEIA life insurance policies. The designation of, chang - es to, and updates of beneficiary information will be the responsibility of the PEIA life insur - ance vendor, Met Life. Mountaineer Flexible Benefits Mountaineer Flexible Benefits is a \"cafeteria plan\" which offers additional optional benefits. This plan is available to active employees of all State agencies, colleges, universities, and those county boards of education and non-State agencies which elect to participate. If you're not sure whether you're eligible, contact your benefit coordinator . Active employees may choose from among several options for dental, vision, hearing and short-and long-term disability insurance, as well as medical care and dependent care flexible spending accounts, and pay for these benefits on a pre-tax basis.

ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES Who is Eligible? As a public employee, you are eligible to be covered under the plans offered by your employ - er if you are: a full-time employee (working regularly at least 20 hours per week); an elected official who works full-time in the elected position; a member of the West Virginia Legislature (must pay 100% of the premium); a member of the West Virginia Board of Education (must pay 100% of the premium); a permanent full-time substitute teacher working on a contract of 90-days or more per school year; an elected member of a county board of education (must pay 100% of the premium); or a school service employee eligible under W.Va. Code, Chapter 18A. Dependents: If you elect PEIA coverage, you may also enroll the following dependents with proper documentation: your legal spouse; your biological children, adopted children, or stepchildren under age 26; other children for whom you are the court-appointed guardian to age 18. A child may not be enrolled for health coverage as both a policyholder (as a public employee in his or her own right) and as a dependent child. Dependent biological children, adopted children, or stepchildren may be covered under the plan to age 26, regardless of their resi - dency, marital status, or the availability of other insurance coverage. The dependent child's marriage is a qualifying event for the policyholder to remove the dependent child from cover - age. The policyholder MAY remove the child, but is not required to do so. Stepchildren must be removed from the policy upon finalization of a divorce.13 From time to time PEIA may conduct eligibility audits to verify that policyholders and depen - dents in the plan qualify for coverage. If you are audited, you will have to produce documen - tation for the dependent in question. If you cannot prove that the dependent qualifies for coverage, coverage will be terminated retroactively to the date the dependent would other - wise have been terminated, and PEIA will pursue reimbursement of any medical or prescrip - tion drug claims paid during the time the dependent was ineligible. How to Enroll or Make Changes You may enroll for or make changes to PEIA health and life benefits using PEIA's online enrollment site, \" Manage My Benefits ,\" or by contacting your benefit coordinator. You will select the types of coverage you want and enroll the eligible dependents you wish to cover. Participation in PEIA benefit plans is not automatic; you must enroll yourself and your depen - dents. Enrollment will authorize your employer or retirement system to deduct the premiums for the coverages you select from your salary or annuity. There are restrictions on how and when you may enroll and make changes in your coverage. Please read all parts of the \"Eligibility\" section of this booklet carefully before you enroll so that you will fully understand your options and responsibilities. New Employees New employees may enroll for health coverage, basic life insurance, dependent life insur - ance, and up to $500,000 of optional life insurance coverage during the calendar month in which you are hired and the following two calendar months. This is your \"initial enrollment period.\" To enroll your dependents, you will need to provide documentation substantiating their eligibility for benefits. The chart on page 31 shows the documentation required. As an active employee, if you enroll for health insurance, you must enroll for basic life insur - ance, as well. If you enroll for basic life insurance, then you may enroll for optional life insur - ance if you so choose. No medical information is required for up to $100,000 of optional life insurance elected during this initial enrollment period. Medical information is always required for optional life insurance in excess of $100,000. You may also enroll for optional life insur - ance for your dependents up to $20,000. Dependent life insurance in excess of $20,000 requires medical information. Health and life insurance coverage will become effective the first day of the calendar month following the date of enrollment. If you enroll and begin work on the first day of a month, your coverage will not be effective until the first day of the following calendar month. If you enroll before you actually start work, coverage will begin the first day of the month following your first day of active employment. Your health care plan selection will remain in effect for a full plan year unless you move outside the service area of your plan or have a qualifying event that enables you to change or cancel coverage. If you choose not to enroll for life insurance during this initial enrollment period, but want life coverage later (basic, optional or dependent) for you or your dependents, you may apply for that coverage at any time, but you will have to submit medical information and be approved by PEIA's life insurance carrier. Coverage will become effective the first day of the calendar month following approval. If you choose not to enroll for health coverage as a new employee, you may do so later during an Open Enrollment period or if you have a qualifying event, in accordance with 14 guidelines in effect at the time you choose to enroll. To enroll as a result of a qualifying event, you must do so during the month of the event or the following two calendar months or you will have to wait until the next Open Enrollment period. Employees hired on and after July 1, 2010 , will not receive any plan subsidy of their health insurance premiums at retirement. These employees may continue coverage in the plan at retirement but must pay the unsubsidized premium for the coverage of their choice. Two exceptions will be made to this rule: 1. Active employees hired before July 1, 2010, who separate from public service but return within two years of their separation may be restored to their original (pre-July 1, 2010) hire date. 2. Retired employees who had an original hire date prior to July 1, 2010, may return to active employment and retain their pre-July 1, 2010, original hire date for purposes of determining their eligibility for premium subsidy. Employees of non-state agencies that join the PEIA Plan after July 1, 2010, will be assigned a \"hire date\" in the PEIA systems that is the same as their effective date of coverage under the PEIA Plan. Upon retirement, these employees will be treated as those hired on or after July 1, 2010, and will be required to pay the full cost of coverage as noted above. Actively at Work For health coverage to be effective, you must be actively at work. To be considered \"actively at work,\" you must: perform the normal tasks for your job on a full-time basis on the day your coverage is to begin; and perform such tasks at one of your normal places of business or at a location to which you must travel to do your job; and not be absent from work because of leave of absence or temporary layoff. If you do not meet these requirements, coverage for you and your dependents will begin on the first day of the month following on which you do meet these requirements. Pre-existing Medical Conditions PEIA has no pre-existing condition limitation. PEIA will provide coverage for all eligible med - ical conditions from the effective date of coverage. Managed care plans also do not apply pre-existing condition limitations on their members. Life Insurance Coverage For life insurance coverage (or an increase in the amount of optional life insurance) to go into effect, you must meet the following requirements on the effective date of coverage: a) have completed a full day of active work on that date; and b) have completed a full day of active work on your last regularly scheduled work day and be able to work on the date you become eligible. If you do not meet the requirements of a) and b) above, coverage will become effective on the date you return to active work. Active work and actively at work mean performing regular duties for a full work day for the policyholder. Effective July 1, 2022 PEIA will no longer be responsible for the management of beneficiaries of PEIA life insurance policies. The designation of, changes to, and updates of beneficiary information will be the responsibility of the PEIA life insurance vendor, Met Life.15 Existing Employees Existing employees may make changes in their coverage as follows: Health Coverage Existing employees who choose not to take health coverage at the time of employment may enroll for health coverage by using PEIA's online enrollment site, \"Manage My Benefits\" or completing a Health Insurance Enrollment Form, provided that they have experienced one of the qualifying events shown in the chart on page 31. Documentation of a qualifying event is required at the time of enrollment. To enroll as a result of a qualifying event, you must do so during the month of the event or the following two calendar months or you will have to wait until the next Open Enrollment. Coverage will be effective on the first day of the month following enrollment. In the absence of a qualifying event, coverage may be added for the employee and/or eligible dependents, only during PEIA's annual Open Enrollment period. Life Insurance Existing employees may add or increase the amount of life insurance at any time by us - ing PEIA's online enrollment site, \"Manage My Benefits\" or completing an Optional Life Insurance Enrollment Form, submitting medical information, and being approved by PEIA 's life insurance carrier. Coverage will become effective on the first day of the month following approval by the life insurance carrier. You must meet the following requirements on the effec - tive date of coverage: a) have completed a full day of active work on that date; and b) have completed a full day of active work on your last regularly scheduled work day and be able to work on the date you become eligible. If you do not meet the requirements of a) and b) above, coverage will become effective on the date you return to active work. Active work and actively at work mean performing regular duties for a full work day for the policyholder. Effective July 1, 2022 PEIA will no longer be responsible for the management of beneficiaries of PEIA life insurance policies. The designation of, changes to, and updates of beneficiary information will be the responsibility of the PEIA life insurance vendor, Met Life. Dependents You may enroll eligible dependents for health and life coverage during your initial enrollment period, and if you do, their coverage begins the same day as yours. To enroll dependents, you must provide documentation substantiating their eligibility for benefits. See page 31 for details. You may enroll dependents for health coverage outside your initial enrollment period only if you experience a qualifying event. If you enroll them at a later date, their cov - erage will become effective the first day of the month following enrollment. In the absence of a qualifying event, you may only enroll dependents for health coverage during Open Enrollment. Coverage will be effective on the first day of the following plan year . To add a dependent to your coverage, you must submit documentation to prove the dependent's eligi - bility. See page 31 for details. If you are adding a dependent to your existing dependent life insurance policy at a date later than the calendar month following an enrollment event, coverage will not become effective until medical information has been submitted to, and approved by, PEIA's life insurance 16 You do not need a Social Security Number to enroll your newborn, but when you get the baby a Social Security Number, please provide it to your benefit coordinator or to PEIA. To enroll the child for health coverage you must: enroll your biological newborn child for health coverage during the calendar month of birth or the two following calendar months; coverage will be made effective retroactive to the date of birth; any premium increase associated with the addition of this child will also be retroactive to the month of birth; and if you do not enroll your newborn within this timeframe, you cannot add the newborn child until the next Open Enrollment period. To enroll the child for life insurance coverage you must: add a biological newborn child to your existing dependent life insurance policy during the calendar month of birth or the two calendar months following the date of birth; coverage will be made effective retroactive to the date of birth; any premium increase associated with the addition of this child will also be retroactive to the month of birth; if you add the child later, you will have to submit medical information and be approved to obtain dependent life insurance coverage for your child. Adopted Child When you adopt a child, you must: provide documentation; PEIA requires a copy of the adoption papers to enroll the child; in the case of a foreign adoption, PEIA requires adoption papers in English, and may require entry visa and/or statement from the U.S. consulate in the country of origin rec - ognizing the adoption. carrier. To add a dependent to your coverage, you must submit documentation to prove that this is an eligible dependent. See page 31 for details. To enroll or add dependents, you must use PEIA's online enrollment site, \" Manage My Benefits \" or complete paper forms available from your benefit coordinator . Coverage is not automatic, even if you have an existing family plan. Dependents may be removed from coverage only during Open Enrollment or at the time of a qualifying event. To make a change as a result of a qualifying event, you must do so during the month of the event or the following two calendar months or you will have to wait until the next Open Enrollment. Qualifying events which end eligibility (such as divorce) must be reported immediately. Step children must be removed from coverage by the policyholder at the time of a divorce. The policyholder must provide documentation supporting the qualifying event to remove dependents. Coverage of removed dependents will terminate at the end of the month in which the policyholder removes them from coverage. For purposes of eligibility , the term \"immediately\" shall mean as soon as practically possible and, in no case, greater than thirty (30) days from the date of the event, e.g. divorce. Medicare for Active Employees For PEIA PPB Plan active employees or dependents of active employees who are 65 or older and eligible for Medicare, as long as you are an active employee, PEIA will be your primary insurer, except in a few rare cases. As long as you are an active employee, neither you nor your Medicare-eligible dependent need to sign up for Medicare Part B and pay the premium. When you prepare to retire, you and your Medicare-eligible dependent must enroll for Medicare Part B. If you do not enroll in Medicare Parts A & B, you will not be eligible for PEIA's Medicare Advantage plan, and your PEIA coverage may be terminated. For PEIA PPB Plan active employees who are also eligible for Medicare, and Medicare is the primary payor, PEIA will use the traditional method of coordinating benefits. If you become eligible for Medicare prior to age 65, you must send a copy of your Medicare card, or other evidence to support Medicare coverage, to PEIA. This notification will make the claims payment process go much more smoothly. Newly Eligible Active Employees Employees who become eligible to enroll for health coverage due to a qualifying event may enroll for coverage during the calendar month of that qualifying event or the two following calendar months. Coverage will become effective the first day of the month following enroll - ment. Newly eligible employees may enroll in one of the PEIA PPB Plans or a managed care plan. They may make another plan selection during the next Open Enrollment period. Special Rules for Newborn or Adopted Children Newborn Child When you have a child, you must: provide documentation; PEIA will accept the Certificate of Live Birth from the hospital as documentation to en - roll the child initially, but you must provide the Birth Certificate as soon as you have it or PEIA will suspend the child's coverage until we receive it;17 You do not need a Social Security Number to enroll your newborn, but when you get the baby a Social Security Number, please provide it to your benefit coordinator or to PEIA. To enroll the child for health coverage you must: enroll your biological newborn child for health coverage during the calendar month of birth or the two following calendar months; coverage will be made effective retroactive to the date of birth; any premium increase associated with the addition of this child will also be retroactive to the month of birth; and if you do not enroll your newborn within this timeframe, you cannot add the newborn child until the next Open Enrollment period.

ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT FOR RETIRED EMPLOYEES Who is Eligible? Retired public employees are eligible for health and life benefits through PEIA, provided: 1. you meet the minimum eligibility requirements of the applicable State retirement sys - tem or a PEIA-approved retirement system; and 2. your last employer immediately prior to retirement is a participating employer in the PEIA Plan and under the State retirement system or a PEIA-approved retirement system*. Members who participate in a non-State retirement system must, in the case of education employees (such as TIAA CREF, TDC or similar plans), meet the minimum eligibility require - ments of the State Teachers Retirement System, and in other cases, meet the minimum eligibility requirements of the Public Employees Retirement System. If you have questions about your retirement, contact the Consolidated Public Retirement Board (CPRB) toll-free at 1-800-654-4406 . If you have PEIA coverage as an active employee, you may continue coverage into retire - ment *. To do so, you must complete Retired Employee Enrollment Forms during the calen - dar month of retirement or the two following calendar months. The retiring employee and all enrolled dependents must re-enroll to continue health benefits into retirement. When plan - ning for retirement, we encourage all members to submit the necessary paperwork well in advance of their anticipated retirement date. * Certain non-state agencies that participate in the PEIA health and life insurance plans for active employ - ees have \"opted out\" of offering their employees PEIA's retiree insurance coverage, called the WV OPEB 19 plan. If an employer opts out of the WV OPEB plan or is ineligible to participate in the WV OPEB plan due to retirement system participation, they are opting out of retiree eligibility for PEIA health and life coverage. Other post-employment benefits (OPEB) refers to the benefits, other than pensions, that a state or local government employee receives as part of his or her package of retirement benefits. Please be aware that, regardless of previous employment, previous or current coverage through PEIA and years of ser - vice, if an employee transfers to an opt-out agency immediately prior to retirement, the employee will not be eligible for retirement health or life insurance benefits through PEIA . PEIA offers non-Medicare retirees coverage through PEIA PPB Plan A or B or an HMO. Non- Medicare retirees must continue coverage in the plan in which they were covered as active employees until the next Open Enrollment, when they can choose any plan for which they are eligible. Retiring employees enrolled in PEIA PPB Plans C or D must choose either PEIA PPB Plan A or B upon retirement, since Plans C and D are not offered to retirees. Medicare- eligible PPB Plan members who retire after the beginning of a plan year, and retired employ - ees who become eligible for Medicare during the plan year are transferred to PEIA 's Special Medicare Plan until the beginning of the next Medicare plan year . Members enrolled in an HMO when they become Medicare-eligible will be transferred to the Special Medicare Plan. Medicare's Plan Year runs from January through December; PEIA follows that plan year for Medicare Retirees. Open Enrollment for Medicare members is held during the month of October with benefits effective on January 1. Under the Special Medicare plan, the member must enroll for traditional Medicare Parts A and B, and their secondary medical and prescription claims are paid by UMR and Express Scripts, respectively. Medical benefits under the Special Medicare Plan are generally the same as those provided under PEIA'S Medicare Advantage plan. Members remain in the Special Medicare plan until the beginning of the next Medicare Plan Year (January 1), when they are transferred to PEIA's Medicare Advantage Plan. These members can request to be transferred immediately to the Humana/PEIA Plan 1. There are two main benefit differences between the PEIA Special Medicare Plan and the Humana/PEIA Plan 1: 1. The Special Medicare Plan does not offer the SilverSneakers\u00ae fitness benefit that includes a free fitness center membership. This is only available from Humana. 2. The cost of non-preferred brand-name medications is different. a) Under the Humana/PEIA Plan 1, the cost-sharing for a 30-day supply of a non-preferred drug is 50% of the cost of the drug, and maintenance medications in this category are eligible for the maintenance medication discount. b) Under the Special Medicare plan, a 30-day supply of a non-preferred drug will cost you 75% of the cost of the drug, and maintenance medications in this catego - ry are NOT eligible for the maintenance medication discount. Continuous coverage and employment are necessary if you wish to use your accrued sick and/or annual leave for extended employer-paid PEIA coverage. You cannot defer your sick and/or annual leave. See page 41 for more information on extending employer paid insur - ance upon retirement. If you were not covered under a PEIA Plan as an active employee or if you allow your cov - erage to lapse, you may choose to enroll for health coverage at the time of your retirement if your last employer immediately prior to retirement is a participating employer in the PEIA Plan and under the State retirement system and as long as you meet the minimum retire - ment qualifications as determined by CPRB. Coverage will be effective on the first day of the month following enrollment.20 Return to Active Employment If you retire, then return to active employment with a participating agency, you will lose your right to use your sick and/or annual leave for extended employer-paid PEIA coverage. When you return to active employment, you have PEIA benefits as an active employee, which makes your new effective date of coverage in the PEIA plan after July 1, 2001, and therefore you are ineligible for the sick/annual leave benefit. The only exception to this rule is provided for those who participated in the plan prior to July 1, 2001, and who become re-employed and elects to participate in the plan upon reemployment with an employer participating in the plan within two years following separation from employment (retirement). In this case, the employee would be permitted to apply any sick and/or annual leave earned after re-employ - ment, toward health premiums at retirement. Employees hired on and after July 1, 2010, will not receive any plan subsidy of their premi - ums at retirement. These employees may continue coverage in the plan at retirement but must pay the unsubsidized premium for the coverage of their choice. Two exceptions will be made to this rule: 1. Active employees hired before July 1, 2010, who separate from public service but return within two years of their separation may be restored to their original (pre-July 1, 2010) hire date. 2. Retired employees who had an original hire date prior to July 1, 2010, may return to active employment and retain their pre-July 1, 2010, original hire date for purposes of determining their eligibility for premium subsidy. Deferred Retirement If you separate from employment before your retirement from a participating employer under the State retirement plan, you may not enroll in PEIA as a retiree if you have other earned in - come just prior to retirement. If you are self-employed or have earned income from any other source, you will not be permitted to enroll as a retiree. To be eligible to enroll in PEIA, your last employer immediately prior to retirement must have been a public entity that participates in the State retirement system or a PEIA-approved retirement system, and in the PEIA Plan. Separated Pre-retirement Employees with 20 Years' Service Employees with 20 or more years of service, who separate from public employment but who have not retired, may enroll in PEIA health benefits for up to two (2) years following sepa - ration. Employees in this category will be required to pay 105% of the total unsubsidized premium for the coverage they choose. Enrollees in this category are not eligible for PEIA's retiree premium assistance program or retiree premium subsidy until such time as they meet CPRB and PEIA's eligibility requirements as a full retiree. Employees in this category are not eligible to extend employer-paid insurance upon retirement using sick/annual leave or years of service credits. Disability Retirement A member who is granted disability retirement by a state retirement system or who receives Social Security disability benefits is eligible to continue coverage in the PEIA Plan as a retired employee, provided that the member meets the minimum years of service requirement of the applicable state retirement system. Members in this category continuously covered since be - fore July 1, 2010, pay the same premiums as those with 25 or more years of service. Those 21 covered on or after July 1, 2010, may continue coverage, but will pay the full, unsubsidized premium for that coverage. If you receive Social Security Disability benefits, please send a copy of your Disability Award letter to PEIA. Generally, those awarded Social Security disability benefits will receive Medicare benefits after a two-year waiting period. When you receive your Medicare ID card, you must provide a copy of that card to PEIA immediately. Disability retirees may be eligible for a life insurance waiver of premium. See page 43 for details. Non-State Agency Retirees Employees who retire from non-state entities which employers joined the PEIA Plan after July 1, 2010, will be assigned a \"hire date\" in the PEIA systems that is the same as their effective date of coverage under the PEIA Plan. Upon retirement, these employees will be treated as those hired on or after July 1, 2010, and will be required to pay the full cost of their coverage. Deputy Sheriffs Deputy sheriffs have the right to retire prior to attaining age 55 and continue their health ben - efits by paying the premiums designated for them in the Shopper's Guide each year. At the time of retirement, these retirees must continue coverage in the plan in which they were cov - ered as active employees until the next Open Enrollment, when they can choose any plan for which they are eligible. Retiring employees enrolled in PEIA PPB Plans C or D must choose either PEIA PPB Plan A or B upon retirement, since Plans C and D are not offered to retirees. Medicare As a retired employee or a dependent of a retired employee, when you become an eligible beneficiary of Medicare, you must: 1. enroll in Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B; and 2. send a copy of your Medicare ID card to PEIA. Your Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) number is required for coverage in PEIA's Medicare Advantage Plan or the Special Medicare Plan. Most Medicare-eligible retired employees and Medicare-eligible dependents of retired em - ployees have coverage through PEIA's Medicare Advantage plans. To be eligible for PEIA's Medicare Advantage plans, the member must enroll for Medicare Parts A and B. If you do not enroll in Medicare Parts A and B and pay the monthly premium, you will not be eligible for PEIA's Medicare Advantage plans, which is the only coverage offered to most retired, Medicare-eligible members. The Medicare Advantage Plans provide different benefit options from which Medicare- eligible retirees can choose. Open Enrollment for Medicare retirees is held each October , with benefits effective on January 1. Medicare retirees' plan year runs from January through December. Benefits for non-Medicare dependents covered by PEIA will run on PEIA's plan year from July through June. If you become eligible for Medicare prior to age 65, please send a copy of your Medicare card and any disability award letter to PEIA. This notification may allow PEIA to reduce your premiums and will make the claims payment process go much more smoothly.22 Medicare offers prescription drug coverage through a program called Medicare Part D. Please be aware that you should NOT purchase Medicare Part D coverage. You DO NOT need to enroll in a separate Medicare Part D plan, since PEIA will provide prescription drug coverage for retirees with Medicare. If you enroll in a separate Medicare Part D plan, you will be disenrolled from all medical and prescription benefits from PEIA. You will have only origi - nal Medicare Parts A, B and D with no secondary coverage. Dependents If you elect PEIA coverage, you may also enroll the following dependents: your legal spouse; your biological children, adopted children, or stepchildren under age 26; or other children for whom you are the court-appointed guardian to age 18. A child may not be enrolled for health coverage as both a policyholder (as a public employee in his or her own right) and as a dependent child. From time to time PEIA may conduct eligibility audits to verify that policyholders and depen - dents in the plan qualify for coverage. If you are audited, you will have to produce documen - tation for the dependent in question. If you cannot prove that the dependent qualifies for coverage, coverage will be terminated retroactively to the date the dependent would other - wise have been terminated, and PEIA will pursue reimbursement of any medical or prescrip - tion drug claims paid during the time the dependent was ineligible. How to Enroll You may enroll for PEIA health and life benefits by completing enrollment forms available from your benefit coordinator or the PEIA website. On these forms, you will select the types of coverage you want and enroll the eligible dependents you wish to cover. When you have completed the forms, return them to your benefit coordinator (if initially retiring) or to PEIA (if already retired). Participation in PEIA benefit plans is not automatic upon retirement; you must complete the proper enrollment forms. Enrollment authorizes PEIA to deduct the premi - ums from your annuity for the coverages you select. There are restrictions on how and when you may enroll and make changes in your coverage. Please read all parts of the \"Eligibility\" section of this booklet carefully before you enroll, so that you will fully understand your op - tions and responsibilities. At present, you cannot initially enroll for retirement benefits on PEIA 's online enrollment website, but once you are retired, you may make changes in your information by going to peia.wv.gov and clicking on \"Manage My Benefits\" . PEIA PPB Plan/PEIA's Medicare Advantage Plan You may enroll for PEIA retiree benefits regardless of age, as long as you meet the eligibility requirements. Non-Medicare retirees have benefits through the PEIA PPB Plan A or B or the managed care plan of their choice. Most Medicare eligible retirees receive their benefits from PEIA's Medicare Advantage plan, although some are enrolled in PEIA's Special Medicare Plan. Managed Care Plans As a retired employee, you may enroll in a managed care plan if you are not eligible for Medicare. If you or any enrolled dependents have Medicare as your primary health coverage 23 (or will at any time during the plan year), you may not join an HMO. Generally , Medicare or an MAPD plan is primary when the policyholder is retired. If you have more questions about when Medicare is primary, call PEIA's Customer Service Unit at 1-888-680-7342 . Life Insurance You may continue your basic, optional and dependent life insurance at the time of retirement. If you wish to elect new or increased life insurance as a retired employee, you must enroll and submit medical information during the calendar month of retirement or the two following calendar months. Coverage will be effective upon approval of PEIA 's life insurance carrier. You may not elect or increase life insurance after this period. If your life insurance lapses after retirement for any reason, for example, for non-payment of premiums, you will not be permitted to reinstate that coverage; you will need to seek life insurance from another source. Enrolling Your Dependents You may enroll dependents for health coverage when you enroll as a retiree, and if you do, their coverage begins the same day as yours. You may enroll dependents for health cover - age outside your initial enrollment period only if you experience a qualifying event. To make a change as a result of a qualifying event, you must do so during the month of the event or the following two calendar months or you will have to wait until the next Open Enrollment. If you enroll them at a later date, their coverage will become effective the first day of the month following enrollment. In the absence of a qualifying event, you may only enroll dependents for health coverage during Open Enrollment; coverage will be effective on the first day of the following plan year. To add a dependent to your coverage, you must submit documentation to prove that this is an eligible dependent. See page 31 for details. If you are adding a dependent to your existing dependent life insurance policy at a date later than the two calendar months following a qualifying event, coverage will not become effective until medical information has been submitted to and approved by PEIA's life insurance carri - er. To add a dependent to your coverage, you must submit documentation to prove that this is an eligible dependent. See page 31 for details. Dependents may be removed from coverage during Open Enrollment or at the time of a qual - ifying event. To make a change as a result of a qualifying event, you must do so during the month of the event or the following two calendar months or you will have to wait until the next Open Enrollment. Qualifying events which end eligibility (such as divorce) must be reported immediately. The policyholder must provide documentation supporting the qualifying event to remove dependents. Coverage of removed dependents will terminate at the end of the month in which the policyholder removes them from coverage. For purposes of eligibility, the term \"immediately\" shall mean as soon as practically possible and, in no case, greater than thirty (30) days from the date of the event, e.g. divorce, termination of Guardianship/parental rights, etc. \"Reporting\" means the proper submission of a \"Change In Status\" form to the member's Employer Agency Benefit Coordinator and/or the proper submission of the Qualifying Event through the PEIA Manage My Benefits Portal with the appropriate supporting documentation, e.g. a copy of the divorce decree, Court Order(s), etc. \"Calling\" and/or e-mailing and informing your participating employer and/or PEIA of an event does not meet the reporting requirements of this section. PEIA PPB Plan/Special Medicare Plan/PEIA's Medicare Advantage Plan For the PPB Plan, the Special Medicare Plan or PEIA's Medicare Advantage Plan, you must enroll new dependents during the calendar month of, or the two calendar months following, 24 the date of the qualifying event that makes them eligible (i.e., date of marriage, date of birth or adoption) even if you already have family coverage. To add a dependent to your cover - age, you must submit documentation to prove that this is an eligible dependent. See page 31 for details. In the absence of a qualifying event, coverage may be added for the em - ployee and/or eligible dependents, only during PEIA's annual Open Enrollment period. Life Insurance Add newly acquired dependents to your existing dependent life insurance policy (Plan 1) during the calendar month of or the two calendar months following the date they become eligible (i.e., date of marriage, date of birth or adoption). Coverage greater than Plan 1 re - quires you to submit medical information and be approved to obtain dependent life insurance coverage. Special Rules for Newborn or Adopted Children Newborn Child When you have a child, you must: provide documentation; PEIA will accept the Certificate of Live Birth from the hospital as documentation to enroll the child initially, but you must provide the Birth Certificate within 90 days or PEIA will terminate the child's coverage; you do not need a Social Security Number to enroll your newborn, but when you get the baby a Social Security Number, please provide it to your benefit coordinator or to PEIA. To enroll the child for health coverage you must: enroll your biological newborn child for health coverage during the calendar month of birth or the two following calendar months; coverage will be made effective retroactive to the date of birth; any premium increase associated with the addition of this child will also be retroactive to the month of birth; and if you do not enroll your newborn within this timeframe, you cannot add the newborn child until the next Open Enrollment period. To enroll the child for life insurance coverage you must: add a biological newborn child to your existing dependent life insurance policy during the calendar month of or two calendar months following the date of birth; coverage will be made effective retroactive to the date of birth; any premium increase associated with the addition of this child will also be retroactive to the month of birth; if you add the child later, you will have to submit medical information and be approved to obtain dependent life insurance coverage for your child. Adopted Child When you adopt a child, you must: provide documentation; PEIA requires a copy of the adoption papers to enroll the child; In the case of a foreign adoption, PEIA requires adoption papers in English, and may require entry visa and/or statement from the U.S. consulate in the country of origin rec - ognizing the adoption.25 To enroll the child for health coverage you must: enroll an adopted child during the calendar month the child is placed in your home or the two following calendar months; coverage will be effective retroactive to the date of placement; any premium increase associated with the addition of this child will also be retroactive to the date of placement; coverage for an adopted infant will become effective the day the adoptive parents are legally and financially responsible for the medical expenses if bona fide legal documen - tation is presented to PEIA; if you do not enroll your child within this timeline, the adopted child cannot be added to your coverage until the next Open Enrollment period. To enroll the child for life insurance coverage you must: add an adopted child to your existing dependent life insurance policy (Plans 1-4) during the calendar month of or the two calendar months following the date of placement in your home; coverage can be made effective retroactive to the date of placement; any premium increase associated with the addition of this child will also be retroactive to the date of placement; If you add the child later, or elect Plan 5, you will have to submit medical information and be approved to obtain dependent life insurance coverage for your adoption child. ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT FOR SURVIVING DEPENDENTS Who is Eligible The surviving spouse or dependent of an active or retired public employee who was insured as a spouse or dependent under the policyholder's coverage by PEIA at the time of the pol - icyholder's death, may elect to continue health coverage as a policyholder in his or her own right under the health plan using a Surviving Dependent enrollment form available from PEIA. If you are a surviving spouse and you choose not to enroll immediately for coverage, you may elect PEIA health coverage during a future Open Enrollment Period if you have not re - married. The surviving spouse's eligibility for PEIA coverage terminates upon remarriage. If a divorce occurs after the remarriage, re-enrollment as a surviving dependent is not allowed. Surviving spouses immediately lose their eligibility for PEIA coverages if they remarry. Coverage will end on the last date of the month of the remarriage. Dependent Children surviving dependent children are eligible to continue health coverage, if they were en - rolled in the health coverage at the time of the policyholder's death, subject to the same age restrictions as other dependent children in the PEIA plan; the deceased policyholder's biological or adopted children and/or stepchildren may con - tinue coverage to age 26; other children for whom the deceased policyholder was the court-appointed guardian may continue coverage to age 18; surviving dependent biological children, adopted children, or stepchildren may be cov - ered under the plan to age 26, regardless of their residency, marital status, or the 26 availability of other insurance coverage. The dependent child's marriage is a qualifying event to cancel PEIA coverage. A married surviving dependent child may not enroll his or her spouse for PEIA coverage. From time to time PEIA may conduct eligibility audits to verify that policyholders and depen - dents in the plan qualify for coverage. If you are audited, you will have to produce documen - tation for the dependent in question. If you cannot prove that the dependent qualifies for coverage, coverage will be terminated retroactively to the date the dependent would other - wise have been terminated, and PEIA will pursue reimbursement of any medical or prescrip - tion drug claims paid during the time the dependent was ineligible. How to Enroll To continue health coverage without interruption, surviving dependents must complete enroll - ment forms in the calendar month death occurs or the two following calendar months. In this case, surviving dependents must enroll in the same plan in which they were covered at the time of the policyholder's death. During Open Enrollment, you may select any plan for which you are eligible. Surviving dependents are not eligible for life insurance. In the event of the death of the employee spouse who is the policyholder in the PEIA Plan, when the surviving dependent is also an active or retired public employee who is benefit- eligible in his or her own right, the surviving dependent has a choice to make. He or she must choose whether to enroll in the PEIA Plan as a surviving dependent of the policyholder, or as an active or retired employee. If you enroll as a surviving dependent, premiums will be based on the Medicare or non-Medi - care retiree premium (depending on the survivor's age) and the years of service earned by the deceased policyholder, but as a surviving dependent, you are not eligible for life insurance. If you enroll as an active employee, premiums will be based on the appropriate active em - ployee premium chart. If retired, the surviving employee's premiums will be based on your own years of service, and you will be eligible for life insurance. If you need help evaluating which would be better, please contact PEIA's customer service unit at 1-888-680-7342 . SPECIAL ELIGIBILITY SITUATIONS If You and Your Spouse are Both Public Employees Two public employees who are married to each other and who are both eligible for benefits under PEIA may elect to enroll as follows: 1. as Family with Employee Spouse in any plan; 2. as \"Employee Only\" and \"Employee and Child(ren) as \"Employee Only\" and \"Employee and Child(ren) in the same plan. All children must be enrolled under the same policyholder. If no children are to be covered, you may enroll as \"Family with Employee Spouse\" or as separate \"Employee Only\" plans. Both employees are eligible to enroll for the basic life policy, as well as optional and depen - dent life insurance.27 To qualify for the Family with Employee Spouse premium, both employees MUST have basic life insurance. For active employees, the premium for Family with Employee Spouse cov - erage is based on the average of the two employees' salaries. The Family with Employee Spouse discount is also offered when the \"employee spouse\" is a retired public employee; the premium for this coverage is based on the active employee's salary. Generally, since both spouses, as policyholders, are eligible to make independent benefit elections, both spouses receive the Shopper's Guide, Summary Plan Description, and other relevant benefit information. If the employee spouse on an active employee's plan is retired and Medicare-eligible, that employee spouse may want to consider becoming a \"policyholder only\" in PEIA 's Medicare Advantage plan. Doing so could reduce your total premium and cost-sharing, depending on your situation. In the event of the death of the employee spouse who is the policyholder in the PEIA Plan, when the surviving dependent is also an active or retired public employee who is benefit-eli - gible in his or her own right, the surviving dependent has a choice to make. He or she must choose whether to enroll in the PEIA plan as a surviving dependent of the policyholder, or as an active or retired employee. If you enroll as a surviving dependent, premiums will be based on the Medicare or non-Medi - care retiree premium (depending on the survivor's age) and the years of service earned by the deceased policyholder, but as a surviving dependent you are not eligible for life insurance. If you enroll as an active employee, premiums will be based on the appropriate active em - ployee premium chart. If retired, the surviving employee's premiums will be based on your own years of service, and you will be eligible for life insurance. If you need help evaluating which would be better, please contact PEIA's customer service unit at 1-888-680-7342 . Transfer from One Participating Agency to Another If you transfer from one participating agency to another in the middle of a plan year without a lapse in coverage, that transfer does not constitute a qualifying event to change coverage. You can only change plans if the transfer moves you out of the enrollment area of a plan so that accessing care is unreasonable. Since the PEIA PPB Plans A, B and C have an unlim - ited enrollment area, you will not be permitted to transfer out of them during the plan year, even if you move. PEIA PPB Plan D is available only to WV residents, so if you move out - side the state you will be required to change plans. When an employee transfers from one participating State agency to another, PEIA will col - lect updated salary information, and the premium at the new agency will be based on the salary at the new agency, whether it is a salary increase or a decrease. In this case, a plan change may be permitted, if the transfer creates a qualifying change in family status under the Premium Conversion Plan. Other transfers may permit a change in coverage based on documented financial hardship. Disabled Child Your dependent child may continue to be covered after reaching age 26 if he or she is inca - pable of self-support because of mental or physical disability. To be eligible:28 the disabling condition must have begun before age 26; the child must have been covered by PEIA upon reaching age 26; and the child must be incapable of self-sustaining employment and chiefly dependent on you for support and maintenance. To continue this coverage, the WV PEIA Disabled Dependent Disability Application must be obtained from PEIA, completed by a licensed physician, and returned to PEIA with all supporting medical records, between 2-3 months prior to the dependent's 26th birthday, to prevent a potential lapse in coverage. Court-Ordered Dependent (COD) If a PEIA policyholder and his or her spouse divorce, and the policyholder is not the custodial parent for the dependent child(ren), the employee may continue to provide medical benefits for the child(ren) through the PEIA plan. If the noncustodial parent is ordered by the court to provide medical benefits for the child(ren), the custodial parent may submit medical claims for the court-ordered dependent(s), and benefits may be paid directly to the custodial par - ent. Special claim forms are required. The custodial parent will also receive Explanations of Benefits (EOBs) for the CODs as claims are processed. PEIA is required by law to comply with National Medical Support Orders and may be compelled to administratively add cover - age(s) for dependents listed in these Orders. Contact PEIA to discuss this benefit. Medicare and Active Employees If an active employee or the dependent of an active employee becomes eligible for Medicare and has no other insurance, the PEIA PPB Plan remains the primary insurer, except if the policyholder or dependent attains Medicare eligibility due to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). As long as you are an active employee, you and your Medicare-eligible dependents are not required to sign up for Medicare Part B and pay the premium. When you prepare to retire, you and your Medicare-eligible dependents must enroll for Medicare Part B. If you do not enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, your coverage may be terminated. For PEIA PPB Plan active employees who are also eligible for Medicare, and Medicare is the primary payor (as in the case of ESRD), PEIA will use the traditional method of coordinating benefits, which means that once Medicare has paid, PEIA will pay the balance up to 100% of Medicare's allowed amount. When you or your dependent become eligible for Medicare, you must send a copy of the Medicare card to PEIA. Medicare-eligible Members Who Reside Outside the U.S. Medicare-eligible retirees who reside outside the United States will have benefits through PEIA's Special Medicare Plan. Medicare claims will be processed by UMR, and PEIA will pay only the amount we would have paid if Medicare had processed your claim and made a payment. Prescription drug claims will be processed by Express Scripts. Leaves of Absence It is the employer's responsibility to make the determination regarding an employee's eligibil - ity for a leave of absence. It is important to note that a leave of absence is intended for an employee who is expected to return to work and for whom the employer maintains an open position. It is not intended to extend medical benefits for individuals who are not eligible to retire and not able to return to work, or for whom a position is not being held open. Such a 29 person is not an employee and it is improper to continue his or her health coverage as if he or she were still an employee. Employers are reminded that under State law it is a felony to misrepresent any material fact to obtain PEIA benefits to which a person is not entitled (W.Va. Code \u00a75-16-12). PEIA is required by law to report all violations of state or federal law to the authorities having jurisdiction. Return from a leave of absence does not constitute a qualifying event which would allow the member to change plans during the plan year. Medical Leave (Non-Workers' Compensation) Any employee who is on a medical leave of absence due to an injury or illness that is not covered by Workers' Compensation is eligible to continue coverage subject to the following: the medical leave must be approved by the employer; the employee and employer must continue to pay their respective proportionate shares of the premium cost. If the employee fails to pay his or her premium, the employer may terminate coverage; the employer is obligated to pay its share only for a period of one year, after which the employee may be required to pay the full cost of coverage. If the employee fails to pay his or her premium, the employer may terminate coverage; and each month the employee must submit to the employer a physician's statement certi - fying that the employee is unable to return to work. The employer must retain these statements in the employee's personnel file. Medical Leave (Workers' Compensation) Any employee who is on a leave of absence and is receiving temporary total disability bene - fits from Workers' Compensation is entitled to continue PEIA coverage until he or she returns to work. The employer and employee must continue to pay their respective proportionate shares of the premium cost for as long as the employee receives temporary total disabil - ity benefits. If the employee fails to pay his or her premium, the employer may terminate coverage. Personal Leave An employee may continue insurance coverage while on a personal leave of absence ap - proved by the employer. The monthly premium will be paid according to the policy or agree - ment established by the employer. If the employee fails to pay his or her premium, the employer may terminate coverage. Family Leave An employee may continue insurance coverage during an approved family leave. If the em - ployee fails to pay his or her premium, the employer may terminate coverage. Contact your benefit coordinator for further details regarding the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Military Leave For an employee on military leave with pay, health and life insurance benefits will generally continue without interruption, as long as the employee is on the payroll.30 An employee who is on an approved military leave of absence without pay, due to an active call of duty from the President, is entitled to continue health and life benefit coverage for as long as premium payments are made. The employee is responsible for paying the em - ployee share of the premium costs for each month during the military leave of absence, and Governor Wise's Executive Order No. 19-01 requires the employer to pay its share. Upon return from a military leave, if there has been a lapse in coverage, the employee may gener - ally reinstate the same health and/or life insurance benefits without penalty . Leaves of Absence for Teachers and Service Personnel Any teacher or school service employee who is returning from an approved leave of absence of one year or less shall be restored to the same benefits which he or she had at the time of the approved leave of absence. OTHER ELIGIBILITY DETAILS Qualifying Events A qualifying event is a personal change in status which may allow you to change your ben - efit elections, whether you or your employer participate in an IRS Section 125 plan, or not. Qualifying events which end eligibility (such as divorce) must be reported immediately . For purposes of eligibility, the term \"immediately\" shall mean as soon as practically possible and, in no case, greater than thirty (30) days from the date of the event, e.g. divorce. For purposes of this section, \"Reporting\" means the proper submission of a \"Change in Status\" form to the member's Employer Agency Benefit Coordinator and/or the proper sub - mission of the Qualifying Event through the PEIA Manage My Benefits Portal with the ap - propriate supporting documentation, e.g. a copy of the divorce decree, Court Order(s), etc. \"Calling\" and/or e-mailing and informing your participating employer and/or PEIA of an event does not meet the reporting requirements of this section. All qualifying events require substantiating documentation, which must be provided in English, as detailed in the chart below:31 QUALIFYING EVENT DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED Divorce Copy of the divorce decree showing that the divorce is final. A \"bifurcated\" divorce ends the marriage and the eligibility of the now ex-spouse and therefore must be reported immediately.

The policyholder MAY remove the child but is not required to do so. Birth of Child Copy of child's birth certificate Adoption Copy of adoption papers Adding coverage for a dependent child Copy of child's birth certificate Adding coverage for any other child who re - sides with policyholderCopy of court-ordered guardianship papers Open Enrollment under spouse's or depen - dent's employer's benefit planCopy of printed material showing Open Enrollment dates and the employer's name Death of spouse or dependent Copy of death certificate Beginning of spouse's or dependent's employmentLetter from the spouse's employer stating the hire date, effective date of insurance, what coverage was added, and what dependents are covered End of spouse's or dependent's employment Letter from the employer stating the termination or retire - ment date, what coverage was lost, and dependents that were covered Significant change in health coverage due to spouse's or dependent's employmentLetter from the insurance carrier indicating the change in insurance coverage, the effective date of that change and dependents covered Unpaid leave of absence by employee, spouse or dependentLetter from your or your spouse's or your dependent's personnel office stating the date the covered person went on unpaid leave or returned from unpaid leave Change from full-time to part-time employ - ment or vice versa for policyholder, spouse or dependentLetter from the employer stating the previous hours worked and the new hours worked and the effective date of the change All documents used in support of eligibility transactions: birth certificates, adoption papers, marriage certificates, divorce decrees, and citizenship documents (V isas, permits, residency documents, etc.), must be in English or have a certified English translation. When submitting documents to PEIA, unless otherwise specified, PEIA requires a \"true and correct\" copy of the document(s). Partial and/or incomplete submissions are not acceptable. \"Pictures\" and/or photographs of legal documents are not acceptable. \"T rue and Correct\" copies would be considered copied and/or scanned to PDF formats. Legal documents in - clude, but are not necessarily limited to: Enrollment forms Change In Status Forms Retirement Paperwork Termination forms Life Insurance forms Powers of Attorney Premium Assistance forms and supporting documents Guardianship paperwork32 Divorce decrees - PEIA only requires the first and last page Marriage certificates Birth certificates National Medical Support Notices Visas/Immigration documents Adoption documents Other PEIA will accept legible, unaltered photos of the following: Medicare cards Social Security Cards Employee Identification cards If you experience a qualifying event, you have the month of the event and the two follow - ing calendar months to act upon that qualifying event and change your coverage. If you do not act within that time frame, you cannot make the change until the next Open Enrollment. Qualifying events which end eligibility (such as divorce) must be reported immediately . For purposes of eligibility, the term \"immediately\" shall mean as soon as practically possible and, in no case, greater than thirty (30) days from the date of the event, e.g. divorce. For purpos - es of this section, \"Reporting\" means the proper submission of a \"Change in Status\" form to the member's Employer Agency Benefit Coordinator and/or the proper submission of the Qualifying Event through the PEIA Manage My Benefits Portal with the appropriate support - ing documentation, e.g. a copy of the divorce decree, Court Order(s), etc. \"Calling\" and/or e-mailing and informing your participating employer and/or PEIA of an event does not meet the reporting requirements of this section. Annual Open Enrollment Each Spring PEIA holds an Open Enrollment period for active employees and non-Medi - care retirees for health coverage. The period is typically the month of April. During Open Enrollment, current active employee and non-Medicare retiree participants may move be - tween plans and make eligibility changes, such as adding or removing dependents or adding or dropping coverage. Choices made during the Open Enrollment period are effective on July 1 of that year. During Open Enrollment, eligible policyholders who have not taken advantage of any health coverage from PEIA also have the opportunity to enroll in any PEIA PPB Plan or any managed care plan, subject to the deadlines and rules in force for that enrollment period. Selections made during Open Enrollment are effective on July 1 of that year and remain in ef - fect for a full plan year unless the member moves outside the service area of his or her plan. A physician's withdrawal from a managed care plan does not qualify a member to change plans in the middle of a plan year. At the beginning of Open Enrollment, PEIA mails a Shopper's Guide to all active and non-Medicare retired policyholders. The Shopper's Guide provides a side-by-side compar - ison of the general attributes of all plans offered. It is intended as a general guide to the available plans. Members requiring further information about a specific plan should contact that plan directly. Medical Identification Cards Each plan mails ID cards to its members. Managed care plans issue ID cards each year . PEIA issues cards upon enrollment in the plan, and subsequently when there are changes in the plan that warrant it.33 Your PEIA PPB Plan ID card verifies that you have medical and prescription drug coverage through PEIA. On the back, we've listed important phone numbers you may need. All oth - ers will receive one card for individual coverage, and two cards for family coverage in the pol - icyholder's name. If you want additional cards, or if you need to replace a lost card, please contact UMR at 1-888-440-7342 . If you enroll in a managed care plan or if you are in PEIA's MAPD plan, you will receive an identification card from that plan, not from PEIA. For additional or replacement cards, call your plan. YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE CHANGES It is your responsibility to keep your PEIA enrollment records up to date. You must notify your benefit coordinator or PEIA immediately of any changes in your participation status or in your family situation and make the appropriate change to keep your PEIA coverage up to date. Examples of such changes include retirement or disability retirement, a change of address, a change in your marital status, or a dependent child no longer qualifying for coverage. You must do this whether you belong to the PEIA PPB Plan, the Special Medicare Advantage plan, a managed care plan or if you've elected only life insurance coverage. If you fail to no - tify your benefit coordinator or PEIA promptly of changes in your family status, your employ - ing agency may look to you for reimbursement of premiums your employer paid in error, and your plan may adjust claims paid for ineligible enrollees. You can update your enrollment records at any time by logging on to the PEIA website at peia.wv.gov and clicking on the green \"Manage My Benefits\" button. If you do not have internet access, you may update your records using a form available from your benefit coor - dinator or by calling PEIA. Completed forms should be returned to your benefit coordinator . WHEN COVERAGE ENDS Coverage for a policyholder and/or dependent(s) will end at the end of the month in which the individual is no longer enrolled for or eligible for coverage. In most cases when your coverage ends you have the option to extend health coverage under the federal COBRA law or convert your life insurance benefits into a private policy. All of these options are at your expense and require you to act within a specified time. Please see the section on \"Options After Termination of Coverage\" on page 36. Voluntary Termination of Employment PEIA coverage for an active policyholder and any covered dependents terminates at the end of the month in which the employee voluntarily ceases employment. For employees on delayed payroll, coverage will terminate at the end of the month in which their employment terminates, although they may continue to receive paychecks due to their delayed payroll status. Involuntary Termination of Employment A policyholder who is terminated from employment involuntarily or through a reduction of work-force may continue coverage for three additional months after the end of the month in 34 which employment ends. The employer must continue to pay the employer's share of the premium during these three months. The policyholder will be responsible for paying the em - ployee's share of the premium during these three months. Termination for Misconduct If an employee is discharged for misconduct and chooses to contest the charge, he or she may extend coverage for up to 3 months while available administrative remedies are pur - sued. If the discharge is upheld, the former employee must reimburse the employer's share of the premium cost for the extended coverage to the former employer. Voluntary Termination of Benefits PEIA coverage for an active policyholder and any covered dependents terminates at the end of the month in which the employee voluntarily terminates the coverage; provided that the employee has experienced a qualifying event that allows such termination. Qualifying events which end eligibility (such as divorce) must be reported immediately . For purposes of eligibil - ity, the term \"immediately\" shall mean as soon as practically possible and, in no case, greater than thirty (30) days from the date of the event, e.g. divorce. In the absence of a qualifying event, coverage cannot be terminated until the next Open Enrollment period. Retired/Retiring Employees Coverage for an employee who has already retired will terminate at the end of the calendar month in which the retiree elects no longer to participate, provided that the retired employee has experienced a qualifying event that allows such termination. In the absence of a qualify - ing event, coverage cannot be terminated until the next Open Enrollment period. For retiring employees, coverage will terminate at the end of the month in which the employ - ee ceases active employment, unless forms have been completed to continue coverage. If you are not yet eligible for Medicare, then your retirement does not qualify you to change health care plans. If you are enrolled in a managed care plan as an active employee, then you must remain in that managed care plan upon retirement until the next Open Enrollment, when you may choose any plan for which you are eligible. If Medicare becomes the primary coverage for you or your dependents while enrolled in a managed care plan, you must trans - fer to PEIA's Medicare Advantage plan or the Special Medicare Plan. Dependents/Surviving Dependents Coverage for dependents terminates at the end of the calendar month in which one of the following occurs: policyholder (active or retired) terminates or loses coverage; dependent spouse is divorced from employee; dependent child reaches his/her 26th birthday; surviving spouse remarries; child for which policyholder is legal guardian reaches his/her 18th birthday; disabled dependent no longer meets disability guidelines; or policyholder voluntarily removes dependent from coverage. The policyholder is required to report these events online at peia.wv.gov using the \"Manage My Benefits\" button, or by completing the appropriate forms to remove ineligible dependents. Qualifying events which end eligibility (such as divorce, termination of Guardianships/pa - rental rights, etc.) must be reported immediately. If a policyholder fails to remove ineligible dependents (divorced spouse, etc.) the Plan may pursue reimbursement of any claims paid 35 for the ineligible dependent from the employee. For purposes of eligibility , the term \"immedi - ately\" shall mean as soon as practically possible and, in no case, greater than thirty (30) days from the date of the event, e.g. divorce. For purposes of this section, \"Reporting\" means the proper submission of a \"Change in Status\" form to the member's Employer Agency Benefit Coordinator and/or the proper submission of the Qualifying Event through the PEIA Manage My Benefits Portal with the appropriate supporting documentation, e.g. a copy of the divorce decree, Court Order(s), etc. \"Calling\" and/or e-mailing and informing your participating em - ployer and/or PEIA of an event does not meet the reporting requirements of this section. The policyholder may voluntarily terminate coverage for dependents when there has been a qualifying event to allow such a change. To make a change as a result of a qualifying event, you must do so during the month of the event or the following two calendar months or you will have to wait until the next Open Enrollment. Qualifying events which end eligibility (such as divorce) must be reported immediately. For purposes of eligibility, the term \"immediately\" shall mean as soon as practically possible and, in no case, greater than thirty (30) days from the date of the event, e.g. divorce. Go to peia.wv.gov and use the \" Manage My Benefits \" button or complete the appropriate forms. If coverage is terminated, it cannot be reinstated until the next Open Enrollment period, unless there is a qualifying event. Failure to Pay Premium Your coverage as an active or retired policyholder, and coverage of your dependents, will be terminated if you fail to pay your premium contributions when due. Premiums are due by the fifth day of the month following the month for which the premium was invoiced. Example: May premium is due June 5. If payment is not received by PEIA within 30 days following the due date, all coverage may be suspended. If payment is not received within 45 days follow - ing the due date, health and life insurance coverage will be canceled, and all medical and prescription drug claims incurred will be your personal responsibility . Canceled life insurance cannot be reinstated, even if past-due premiums are paid. The cancellation is permanent, and you will need to seek life insurance from another provider. PEIA will also submit premi - ums overdue by 45 days to a collection agency. Direct Pay For non-Medicare policyholders who pay premiums directly to PEIA, if payment is not re - ceived by PEIA within 30 days following the due date, a termination notice containing the termination date will be mailed to the policyholder. All claims incurred following the termina - tion date will be the policyholder's personal responsibility. The policyholder has the right to appeal the termination in writing within 60 days following the termination date. If the terminated policyholder appeals the termination in writing within 60 days from the date of termination, he or she must pay the past-due premiums, apply to pay premiums by direct draft from a bank account, and may be granted uninterrupted medical and pre - scription coverage at PEIA's discretion. Life insurance cannot be reinstated. If the terminated policyholder appeals the termination in writing more than 60 days following the date of termination, PEIA may only allow re-enrollment for health coverage if the policyholder enrolls as a new enrollee and agrees to pay premiums by direct draft from a bank account. Two terminations for failure to pay within a 12-month period may result in permanent disqualification from coverage under the PEIA plan. If extenuating circumstances prevent the policyholder from appealing within 60 days of the termination, the policyholder may send a written request, and the PEIA director may grant a waiver of the 60-day requirement, at his or her discretion.36 For Medicare policyholders who pay premiums directly to PEIA, failure to pay premiums will result in termination from the plan consistent with applicable Medicare rules. Non-State Agency Employer Withdrawal from the Plan By its agreement to participate in the PEIA plan, a non-State entity is required by PEIA to stay in the plan for a minimum of three years. If a participating county or municipal govern - ment or other employer withdraws or is terminated from the PEIA plan, coverage for all af - fected insureds ends on the effective date of that employer's withdrawal/termination. PEIA requires a written 30-day notice of a Non-State Agency's intent to terminate its contract with PEIA. Eligible retirees may continue participation in PEIA. The withdrawn agency is billed a non-participating agency premium for these retirees. Retirees not eligible to participate in PEIA must look to their former employer for retiree coverage. OPTIONS AFTER TERMINATION OF COVERAGE If your PEIA coverage terminates, you may have a right to continue health and life coverage. Your options are explained below. Continuing Health Coverage under COBRA You and your enrolled dependents may have the right to continue your current health cov - erage for a limited time under the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). PEIA's COBRA program is administered by UMR, and all COBRA eligibility is maintained by UMR. New enrollees in any PEIA-sponsored health plan will receive a de - tailed notice of their COBRA rights from UMR. You and/or your dependents may elect to continue coverage for up to 18 months due to ter - mination of your employment (other than by reason of gross misconduct) or reduction in work hours. Your dependents are eligible to continue coverage in their own right for a maximum of 36 months under COBRA in the case of: divorce or legal separation; loss of eligibility of dependent children; or death of employee. An election to continue coverage under COBRA must be made within 60 days starting from the latest of: (1) the date on which the qualifying event occurs; (2) the date on which you lose (or would lose) coverage under the plan due to the qual - ifying event; or (3) the date on which you are informed, through the furnishing of either the SPD or the COBRA general notice, of the responsibility to notify the plan and procedures for doing so. If you elect to continue coverage under COBRA, you will be responsible for paying the full premium plus a 2% administrative fee. Please note that COBRA premiums are billed directly to you.37 To enroll for COBRA benefits, complete the forms and return to UMR or contact UMR at 1-888-440-7342 . If 18 months of COBRA coverage is provided due to termination or reduction in hours of employment, and if any COBRA beneficiary is determined to be disabled under the Social Security Act at any time during the first 60 days of this COBRA coverage, then the 18-month continuation period may be extended to 29 months for all individuals who are qualified ben - eficiaries. The disabled person can be a covered employee or a dependent. The disability determination must be reported to PEIA within 60 days of the determination and before the end of the original 18-month coverage period. Under COBRA, PEIA will charge 150% of the applicable premium for coverage during the 11-month disability extension. If a second qualifying event occurs during the 11-month ex - tension, entitling a qualified beneficiary to 36 months of coverage (an additional 7 months of coverage), then PEIA will charge 150% of the applicable premium until the end of the 36-month continuation coverage period. Coverage under COBRA will cease under these circumstances (\"you\" refers to the person who elected COBRA): you become covered under another group plan (unless it contains a pre-existing condi - tion exclusion that reduces your benefits); you become entitled to Medicare; you fail to pay the premium; the policyholder's former employer withdraws or is terminated from the PEIA plan; or the PEIA PPB Plan ends. If you are covered by another health plan or Medicare before the COBRA election is made, you may make a COBRA election. In other words, your employer may end the right to COBRA continuation coverage based upon other group health plan coverage or entitlement to Medicare benefits only if the qualified beneficiary first becomes covered under the other group health plan coverage or entitled to (covered for) the Medicare benefits after the date of the COBRA election. Converting Life Insurance to an Individual Policy When employment ends, you may convert all or part of the life insurance coverage into an individual policy. Dependents who lose eligibility for life insurance coverage may convert op - tional dependent life insurance to an individual policy. This provision does not apply to retired employees or their dependents. You must submit an application and remit the first premium within 31 days after the termina - tion of the life insurance coverage. Coverage under the individual policy will become effec - tive the day after the group life insurance coverage ends. To obtain a Life Insurance Conversion Application Form, call MetLife at 1-888-466-8640 . The individual life insurance policy is issued by PEIA's life insurance carrier, MetLife. Once you have completed the application form, mail it to the address printed on the application form. Premiums for individual policies are generally higher than rates for a group plan. PAYING FOR BENEFITS Each year the PEIA Finance Board sets premium rates for the PEIA PPB Plans. Premiums are set at a level that ensures that the premiums collected from employers and employees will pay the anticipated claims for that year. Managed care plan premiums are also set annu - ally prior to Open Enrollment.38 Your coverage as an active or retired policyholder, and coverage of your dependents, will be terminated if you fail to pay your premium contributions when due. Premiums are due by the fifth day of the month following the month for which the premium was invoiced. Example: May premium is due June 5th. If payment is not received by PEIA within 30 days following the due date, all coverage may be suspended. If payment is not received within 45 days fol - lowing the due date, coverage will be canceled, and all claims incurred will be your personal responsibility. PEIA will also submit premiums overdue by 45 days to a collection agency. Direct Pay For non-Medicare policyholders who pay premiums directly to PEIA, if payment is not re - ceived by PEIA within 30 days following the due date, a termination notice containing the termination date will be mailed to the policyholder. All claims incurred following the termina - tion date will be the policyholder's personal responsibility. The policyholder has the right to appeal the termination in writing within 60 days following the termination date. If the terminated policyholder appeals the termination in writing within 60 days from the date of termination, he or she may pay the past-due premiums, apply to pay premiums by direct draft from a bank account, and may be granted uninterrupted coverage at PEIA's discretion. If the terminated policyholder appeals the termination in writing more than 60 days following the date of termination, PEIA may only allow re-enrollment if the policyholder enrolls as a new enrollee and agrees to pay premiums by direct draft from a bank account. Two termina - tions for failure to pay within a 12-month period may result in permanent disqualification from coverage under the PEIA plan. If extenuating circumstances prevent the policyholder from appealing within 60 days of the termination, the policyholder may appeal for and the PEIA director may, at his or her discre - tion, grant a waiver of the 60-day requirement. For Medicare policyholders who pay premiums directly to PEIA, failure to pay premiums will result in termination from the Plan consistent with applicable Medicare rules. Tobacco-free Premium Discount All health and optional life insurance premiums are based on the tobacco-use status of in - sureds. Tobacco-free insureds receive the preferred monthly premium rate. Insureds must have been tobacco-free for 6 months prior to the beginning of the Plan Year to qualify for the discount for the entire plan year. From time to time, the tobacco-free waiting period may be adjusted, and members will be notified in writing. If your doctor certifies on a form provided by the PEIA that it is unreasonably difficult due to a medical condition for you to become tobacco-free or it is medically inadvisable for you to become tobacco free, PEIA will work with you for an alternative way to qualify for the tobac - co-free discount. Send all such doctors' certifications and requests for alternative ways to receive the discount to: PEIA Discount Alternatives, 601 57th St., SE, Suite 2, Charleston, WV 25304-2345. For family health coverage, all enrolled family members must be tobacco-free to qualify the family for the reduced rate. PEIA reserves the right to review medical records to check for tobacco use. PEIA offers a tobacco cessation benefit. See \"Tobacco Cessation\" on page 84 for details. Once a member has submitted a tobacco affidavit, PEIA will rely upon that affidavit from year to year, unless the member submits a replacement. It is not necessary for members to 39 submit a tobacco affidavit each year, although PEIA may, periodically, require policyholders to update their tobacco status during Open Enrollment. Instructions for updating tobacco sta - tus, if required, will be provided in the Shopper's Guide. Members who become tobacco-free during a plan year may apply for the discount when they have been tobacco-free for at least six months. Apply online at peia.wv.gov ; click on the green \"Manage My Benefits\" button at the top right of the page. Affidavits completed online are processed immediately, and the discount becomes effective on the first day of the following month. When using a paper affidavit, PEIA has sixty days from receipt of the tobac - co affidavit to process the request and implement the discount. The tobacco-free discount will apply only to future premiums and WILL NOT be applied retroactively. No refunds will be granted based on tobacco status. Newly hired insureds must have been tobacco-free for 6 months prior to their effective date of coverage to qualify for the discount and must complete the tobacco affidavit online or on paper to receive the discount. Advance Directive/Living Will PEIA no longer offers an Advance Directive/Living Will discount. We encourage members to have an Advance Directive/Living Will and to discuss it with their family and health care providers, but the premium discount has been discontinued. DETERMINING MONTHLY PREMIUMS Active Employees If you are an active employee of a State agency, college, university or county board of edu - cation, most of your health insurance premium is paid by your employer. The amount of your contribution is determined by your salary, the type of coverage you choose, and your tobac - co-use status. If you are an active employee of a local government agency, your employer will set your health insurance premium contribution level. You may pay anywhere from 0% to 100% of the premium that PEIA charges to your employer. If you are a member of the West Virginia Legislature, a member of the West Virginia Board of Education, or an elected member of a county board of education, you must pay 100% of the premium for any coverage you elect. Retired Employees Premiums for retired employees are determined based on a number of factors, including hire date and retirement date. See more information below. Premiums for most retired employ - ees are deducted from their annuity on a monthly basis. Some retired employees pay pre - miums directly to PEIA each month, and for them, premiums are due by the fifth of the month following the month for which the premium was invoiced. Example: May premium is due June 5th. Employees Hired on or After July 1, 2010 Employees hired on and after July 1, 2010, will not receive any plan subsidy of their health insurance premiums at retirement. These employees may continue coverage 40 in the plan at retirement but must pay the unsubsidized premium for the coverage of their choice. Two exceptions are made to this rule: Active employees hired before July 1, 2010, who separate from public service but return within two years of their separation may be restored to their original (pre-July 1, 2010) hire date. Retired employees who had an original hire date prior to July 1, 2010, may return to active employment and retain their pre-July 1, 2010, original hire date for purposes of determining their eligibility for premium subsidy. Retirees from non-state entities which employers joined the PEIA Plan on or after July 1, 2010, will also receive no premium subsidy and must pay the full cost of their participation in the plan. Such non-state retirees will be assigned a \"hire date\" in the PEIA systems which is the same as the date they enroll in PEIA as an active employee. Regardless of any other discussion of premium subsidy later in this section, employees hired on or after July 1, 2010, who don't meet one of the two exceptions above, will not receive any premium subsidy for years of service or any other factor. Retired Employees Who Retired Before July 1, 1997 Retired employees who retired prior to July 1, 1997, pay premiums based on the plan they choose, their tobacco-use status, and eligibility for Medicare, but NOT their years of service. These retirees are not subject to the \"years of service\" policy. For premium purposes, em - ployees who retired prior to July 1, 1997, fall into the \"25 or more\" years of service category on PEIA's premium charts. Eligible retired employees may use sick and/or annual leave to extend employer-paid health coverage. Employees Who Retire on or After July 1, 1997 Employees who retire on or after July 1, 1997, pay premiums for their health coverage based on the plan they choose, their eligibility for Medicare, their tobacco-use status, and their cred - ited years of service as reported by the Consolidated Public Retirement Board (CPRB), or for those in the Teachers Defined Contribution Plan or a non-State retirement plan, the years of service reported by the employing agency or the non-State plan. These premiums may be adjusted annually for medical inflation. If you are using accrued sick and/or annual leave or years of service to extend your employer-paid insurance, all or a portion of the premium will be covered by your accrued leave. The amount of sick and/or annual leave accrued by the retiring employee will be reported by the benefit coordinator at the agency from which the employee is retiring. Disability retiree premiums are assessed on twenty-five (25) years of service. Surviving Dependents Surviving dependents of public employees pay premiums for their health coverage based on the plan they choose, their eligibility for Medicare, and their tobacco-use status. These pre - miums may be adjusted annually for medical inflation. Premiums charged to surviving dependents are determined by when the surviving dependent enrolls: For surviving dependents enrolled before July 1, 2010, premiums are based on the Medicare or non-Medicare (depending on the survivor's age) retiree premium for \"25 or more years of service.\"41 For surviving dependents enrolled on or after July 1, 2015, premiums are based on the Medicare or non-Medicare (depending on the survivor's age) retiree premium and the years of service earned by the deceased policyholder. Premiums for surviving dependents are deducted from their annuity on a monthly basis or are paid directly to PEIA. Extending Employer-Paid Insurance upon Retirement You may be eligible to extend your employer-paid insurance with any leave balances avail - able upon retirement. To take advantage of this benefit, you must move directly from active public employment into your respective retirement system. You must use your leave at the time of retirement. You may not save the leave for use later. If you choose to separate from employment and defer your retirement, you cannot defer your sick and/or annual leave or years of teaching service for use later. Elected public officials are not eligible for this benefit. This benefit terminates when the policyholder dies; it cannot be used by surviving depen - dents, who may continue coverage by paying the monthly premium. Using Accrued Sick and Annual Leave to Extend Coverage If you are an employee of a PEIA-participating employer (State agency , county board of education, local agency, college or university) with coverage through PEIA and have accrued sick and/or annual leave when you retire, you may use that accrued leave to extend your employer-paid insurance coverage. You must be enrolled in a PEIA PPB plan or a PEIA- sponsored managed care plan or the group life insurance plan offered by PEIA prior to your retirement to qualify. This extended coverage must be for full months, and the leave must be used immediately at the time of retirement. Employees hired on or after July 1, 2001, are not eligible for this benefit. If the policyholder dies, the accrued leave benefit terminates, even if the surviving dependent continues coverage. If you and your spouse are both public employees eligible for extended employer-paid insur - ance coverage, you may combine your accrued leave to extend your family coverage provid - ed each of your respective employers agrees. Certain restrictions apply . See your benefit coordinator for details. You may also have the option to use your accrued leave to increase your retirement benefits from your retirement system. You must choose between additional retirement benefits and extended employer-paid insurance coverage. You may not use some of your accrued leave to increase your retirement benefit and the rest to extend your employer-paid insurance cov - erage. Once this election is made, you may not revoke the selection. Calculating Your Benefit The amount of this benefit depends on when you were hired and came into the PEIA plan as follows: Before July 1, 1988: If you elected to participate in the plan before July 1, 1988, and have been continuously cov - ered by PEIA since that time, then your extended employer-paid coverage is calculated as follows:42 2 days of accrued leave = 100% of the premium for one month of single coverage 3 days of accrued leave = 100% of the premium for one month of family coverage Between July 1, 1988 and June 30, 2001: If you elected to participate in the plan on or after July 1, 1988, and before July 1, 2001 or if you had a lapse in coverage during the period, then your extended employer-paid coverage is calculated as follows: 2 days of accrued leave = 50% of the premium for one month of single coverage 3 days of accrued leave = 50% of the premium for one month of family coverage On or after July 1, 2001: If you elected to participate in the plan on or after July 1, 2001, or if you had a lapse in coverage after this date, you are not eligible for extended employer-paid insurance upon retirement. Extending Coverage for Higher Education Faculty If you are a full-time faculty member employed on an annual contract basis for a period other than 12 months, you may extend your employer-paid insurance coverage based on your years of teaching service. Your benefit is calculated as follows: 3 1/3 years of teaching service = 1 year of single coverage 5 years of teaching service = 1 year of family coverage This benefit is not available to faculty hired on or after July 1, 2009. Retired Employee Assistance Programs Retired employees whose total annual income is less than 250% of the federal poverty lev - el (FPL) may receive assistance in paying a portion of their PEIA monthly health premium based on years of active service, through a grant provided by the PEIA called the Retired Employee Premium Assistance program. Applicants must be enrolled in the PEIA PPB Plan, the Special Medicare Plan or PEIA's Medicare Advantage plan. Managed care plan members are not eligible for this program. Retired employees using accrued sick and/or annual leave to pay their premiums are not eligible for this program until their accrued leave is exhausted. Applications are mailed to all retired employees with health coverage each spring. Medicare-eligible retirees with 15 or more years of service who qualify for Premium Assistance may also qualify for Benefit Assistance. Benefit Assistance reduces the medical and prescription out of pocket maximums and most copayments. It is described in detail in the Evidence of Coverage provided by PEIA's Medicare Advantage Plan. For additional de - tail or for a copy of the application, call PEIA's customer service unit at 1-888-680-7342 . The amount of assistance for which you are eligible is based on years of active service and percentage of FPL. For surviving dependents, it will be based on years of service earned by the deceased policyholder. Disabled retirees are considered to have twenty-five (25) years of service. Following is a chart that shows the premium reductions provided under the Retired Employee Premium Assistance program.43 POLICYHOLDER ONLY MONTHLY PREMIUM REDUCTION This amount will be deducted from your monthly premium for Medicare or non-Medicare coverage. If the amount of the reduction is greater than the premium due, then the premi - um due will be $0. Years of Service< 100% of FPL 100-150% of WITH DEPENDENTS MONTHLY PREMIUM REDUCTION This amount will be deducted from your monthly premium for Medicare or non-Medicare coverage. If the amount of the reduction is greater than the premium due, then the premi - um due will be $0. Years of Service<100% of FPL 100-150% of FPL Premiums Life insurance premiums for all participants are set by PEIA's life insurance carrier. For active employees of State agencies, colleges, universities and county boards of education, basic life insurance premiums are paid by your employer. For active employees of a local government agency, your employer will determine what, if any, portion of the life insurance premium will be paid for you. Retired employees must pay the basic life insurance premium to keep coverage in force. Optional life insurance premiums are paid by the employee and are based on age and amount of coverage. See your Life Insurance Booklet for further de - tails of the options available to you. Life Insurance Waiver of Premium If you are an active employee with basic life insurance, and you become totally disabled be - fore you reach age 60, your basic life insurance may be continued at no cost to you while you remain totally disabled. To qualify for this waiver of premium, you must furnish proof of total disability within one year after the date of disability. The date of disability is considered the last day you were actively at work. You must furnish proof of total disability after you have been disabled for nine (9) months, but not later than twelve (12) months after your last day of active work. To qualify for the waiver of premium, you must have been covered under basic life insurance when your disability began. \"Total Disability\" exists when you are completely unable, due to sickness or injury or both, to engage in any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably fitted by education, train - ing or experience. You will not be considered totally disabled while working at any gainful occupation. To apply for a disability waiver of premium, contact your benefit coordinator. Proof of continu - ing disability will be required three months before each anniversary of the initial date of dis - ability. You may be asked by PEIA's life insurance carrier to submit periodic medical exams. AD & D coverage does not continue under the waiver of premium. If your waiver of premium 44 is approved, your basic life insurance will remain at $10,000 at no premium cost to you. At age 65, your basic life coverage decreases to $5,000, and further reduces to $2,500 at age 67. This coverage will end at the earliest of these events: the end of disability the failure to provide proof of continued disability; or the failure to submit to a physical examination when required by PEIA 's life insurance carrier. See your Life Insurance Booklet for more details. Managed Care Plan Premium If you enroll in a managed care plan offered by the PEIA for your health coverage, your premium contribution is set by the managed care plan. Premiums are published in the Shopper's Guide each year prior to Open Enrollment. The published premiums are set for one year. Local government agencies will determine their contribution for managed care plans. To find the amount of your premium contribution, check the Shopper's Guide for the current plan year, or contact your benefit coordinator. The managed care plans being offered by your employer are part of the PEIA benefits pack - age and you may enroll for any plan in which you meet the eligibility guidelines. Your plan choice is binding for one year unless you move outside the service area of the plan you have chosen. Your physician's withdrawal from a plan does not qualify you to change plans. PREMIUM CONVERSION Paying Premiums with Pre-Tax Dollars The PEIA Premium Conversion Plan is an IRS Section 125 plan which allows active, partici - pating employees to save tax dollars when paying health and life insurance premiums. Your participation in the premium conversion plan is automatic if you are an active employee of one of the following: State government and its agencies; State-related colleges and universities; or A participating county board of education. Federal law does not allow retired employees to participate in premium conversion. With premium conversion, your premiums are deducted from your salary before federal, state and Social Security taxes are calculated. This reduces the amount of your income subject to tax. You must agree to pay the premiums through this plan for a full plan year, unless you have a change in family status that allows you to change your benefits. The following exam - ple demonstrates how premium conversion can reduce your taxes and increase your take- home pay. This example does not include State income tax and assumes a 15% federal income tax bracket.45 WITHOUT PREMIUM CONVERSION PLANWITH PREMIUM CONVERSION PLAN Amount Description Amount Description $1,500 Monthly Income (Taxable Income)$1,500 Monthly Income -$340 Taxes -$121 Insurance Premium $1,160 After-tax $1,066 Take-home Pay $27 Additional Take-home Income How to Participate If your employer offers the premium conversion plan your premiums automatically will be de - ducted on a pre-tax basis. If you do not wish to participate in the premium conversion plan, you must indicate this in writing to your benefit coordinator. Decisions regarding premium conversion must be made when you initially enroll for PEIA coverage or during the annual Open Enrollment period each spring. Limits on Benefit Changes Under the IRS rules, you must pay the same amount of premium each month during the year , unless you have a qualifying change in family status. Qualifying changes in family status include: marriage or divorce of the employee; death of the employee's spouse or dependent; birth or adoption of the employee's child; commencement or termination of employment of the employee's spouse or dependent; a change from full-time to part-time employment status, or vice versa, by the employee or his or her spouse; an unpaid leave of absence taken by the employee or spouse; a significant change in the health coverage of the employee or spouse attributable to the spouse's employment; annulment; change in the residence or work site of the employer, spouse, or dependent; a dependent loses eligibility due to age; or employment change due to strike or lock-out. You may make a change in your plan when your spouse or dependent changes coverage during Open Enrollment under his/her plan if: the other employer's plan permits mid-year changes under this event; and the other employer's plan year is different from PEIA. For life insurance, the IRS allows you to pay pre-tax premiums on up to $50,000 of life in - surance. This includes the $10,000 basic plan and up to $40,000 of optional life insurance. Since you're paying pre-tax premiums on only $40,000 of optional life insurance, you may terminate any life insurance you have in excess of $40,000 at any time during the plan year , but you can terminate your basic or the first $40,000 of optional life insurance only during the premium conversion plan Open Enrollment each spring. To make a change in your coverage, use PEIA's online enrollment site, \"Manage My Benefits\" or get a Change-in-Status form from your benefit coordinator. ALL changes re - quire additional documentation.46 HEALTH CARE BENEFITS Active employees may get health care benefits through PEIA from a managed care plan or from one of the PEIA PPB Plans. Non-Medicare retirees and surviving dependents may get health care benefits through PEIA from a managed care plan or from PEIA PPB Plan A or B, although Plan B is only available when all enrolled dependents are non-Medicare. Medicare- eligible members of the Special Medicare Plan also receive their benefits through PEIA. PEIA PPB Plans C and D are not offered to retirees. PPB Plan C is an IRS-qualified, High- Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). For more information about Plan C, download Summary Plan Description (Plan C) at peia.wv.gov or call 1-888-680-7342 . Most Medicare-eligible retired employees and Medicare-eligible dependents of retired em - ployees are covered by PEIA's Medicare Advantage plan, so the benefits described here do not apply to them. If you choose to receive your benefits from a managed care plan, you must enroll with PEIA and choose a plan. Refer to the information provided by the managed care plan for details of your benefits. If you choose the PEIA PPB Plan A, B or D, your benefits are described on the following pag - es. PEIA PPB Plan C is an IRS-qualified, High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). For more information about Plan C, download Summary Plan Description (Plan C) at peia.wv.gov or call 1-888-680-7342 . 47 PEIA PPB PLANS A, B AND D The PEIA PPB Plans A, B and D pay for a wide range of health care services for employees and their dependents. These benefits include hospital services, medical services, surgery, durable medical equipment and supplies, and prescription drugs. The medical benefits in the PEIA PPB Plans A, B and D are identical. The difference is in the deductibles, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums, and in Plan D's provider network. Under the plans, certain costs are your responsibility. In addition, to receive maximum ben - efits for some services, precertification is required, or your benefits will be reduced. Please read the health care benefits section carefully so that you will have a clear understanding of your coverage under the plan. If you have any questions about coverage or payment for health care services, please call: Medical claims and benefits - UMR at 1-888-440-7342 . Precertification, pre-authorizations, Complex Condition CARE or prior approval for out-of- state care and Maternity CARE - UMR at 1-888-440-7342 .

Specialty Injectable drug claims and 1-888-440-7342 . PEIA's Networks PEIA PPB Plans A & B The PEIA PPB Plans provide care through several networks of providers, and the benefit lev - el depends on whether the care is provided inside West Virginia, or out, and on whether the out-of-state care is approved in advance by UMR, if necessary. In West Virginia, any proper - ly licensed health care provider who provides health care services or supplies to a PEIA par - ticipant is automatically considered a member of our network. Outside West Virginia, PEIA uses the UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus PPO to provide care for members of PEIA PPB Plans A, B and C. The UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus PPO contracts with some out-of-state provid - ers to serve PEIA PPB Plans A, B and C participants only. To locate a network provider, call UMR at 1-888-440-7342 . Care provided outside West Virginia, even by network providers, costs more. Outside West Virginia, even with the discount contracts we have with network providers, PEIA cannot con - trol its costs as it can inside West Virginia. Therefore, your out-of-pocket costs will be higher if you use in-network providers outside the state of West Virginia. Not all providers in the UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus PPO network may participate with PEIA. Kings Daughters Medical Center in Kentucky remains out-of-network for PEIA, re - gardless of their network status with the PPO network. Also, PEIA does not use the PPO network in Washington County, Ohio, (including Marietta Memorial Hospital) or Boyd County, Kentucky. PEIA reserves the right to remove providers from the network, so not all providers listed in the network may be available to you.48 PEIA PPB Plan D PEIA PPB Plan D members have access to WV providers ONLY. For PEIA PPB Plan D, the only care allowed outside the State of West Virginia will be emergency care to stabilize the patient for transport back to a WV facility, and a limited number of procedures that are not available from any health care provider inside West Virginia. Plan D members must contact UMR when it appears that out-of-state care may be necessary. UMR will direct the patient to the appropriate facility to provide care \u2014 either in WV or out-of-state. Non-emergency care provided outside WV without approval from UMR IS NOT COVERED. Sanctioned Providers Providers, both in and out of state, who are under sanction by Medicare, Medicaid or both are excluded from PEIA's network for the duration of their sanction. Additionally, providers may be excluded from PEIA's network based upon adverse audit findings. PEIA reserves the right to block, ban, or refuse payment to any provider identified as engaging in potentially fraudulent activity. If you have questions about a specific network provider, please contact UMR at 1-888-440-7342 . Resident PPB Plan A & B Participants PEIA PPB Plans A & B participants who live in West Virginia or a bordering county of a sur - rounding state may access care from any of the following providers without receiving prior approval: any West Virginia health care provider who provides health care services or supplies to a PEIA participant; or any network provider located in those bordering counties. All services, except emergency care, provided outside of West Virginia beyond the bordering counties require prior approval. Non-Resident PPB Plan A & B Participants For PEIA PPB Plans A & B participants who reside outside the State of West Virginia (be - yond the bordering counties of surrounding states), PEIA has made special arrangements. Participants who live more than one county outside the State may seek care from any net - work provider without obtaining prior approval. Care from network providers will be covered at the highest out-of-state benefit level. Precertification of inpatient stays and certain outpa - tient procedures is still required. See page 62 for details. Non-Network Providers Care provided by non-network providers is not covered except for the initial care in an emer - gency, or if those services are not available from a network provider. What You Pay with the PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D Medical Deductible During any plan year, if you or your eligible dependents incur expenses for covered medical services (other than office visits), you must meet a deductible before the plan begins to pay . Medical deductibles are determined based on your salary, tier of coverage (i.e., individual or family), and whether you get your services within the PEIA network, or, if out-of-state beyond the bordering counties, whether you have prior approval from UMR.49 The family deductible is shared among the family members. No one member of the family will pay more than the individual deductible (see Employee Only in the chart). Once one person has met the individual deductible, the plan will begin paying on that person. When another member of the family meets the balance of the family deductible, then the plan will begin paying on the entire family. Alternatively, all members of the family may contribute to the family deductible with no one person meeting the individual deductible; once the family deductible is met, the plan pays on all members of the family. The deductibles are listed on the following chart according to income level and coverage tier. Deductibles for Family with Employee Spouse coverage are based on the average of the two employees' salaries. This provision does not apply to local government agency employees or retired employees. ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLES Annual Salary Employee OnlyEmployee & Child(ren)Family Family with Employee Spouse* PEIA PPB Plan A & D (state agencies, colleges, universities and county boards of education)$0 (state agencies, col - leges, universities and county boards of family member may to meet the 'employee only' deductible, which is $1,225. See Medical Deductible beginning above the chart.50 OOSINNA or Lower Level of Benefit: For in-network out-of-state care beyond the bordering counties, if not approved in advance at the highest out-of-state benefit level, the deductible and out-of-pocket maximum amounts are doubled, and the plan pays only 60% of the al - lowed amount. For inpatient admissions that span two plan years, the facility charges are paid based on the first plan year, but physician charges are paid based on the date of service, which could be in the first plan year, or both plan years. For example, if you go into the hospital on June 28 and are released on July 6, the hospital bill is paid based on the date of admission, so it would fall under the old plan year's deductible. Physician charges are paid based on the date of service, so if you have surgery on July 2, the surgeon's bill will be processed based on the new plan year, and the deductible for the new plan year will apply to the surgeon's bill. The OOSINNA (Lower Level of Benefit) deductible applies to the in-network deductible, but the in-network deductible does not satisfy the OOSINNA deductible. Please note that the amounts listed in the chart are for in-network deductibles. OOSINNA deductibles are twice the amount of the in-network deductibles listed above. Prescription drug benefits are subject to a separate deductible. See the \"Prescription Drug Benefit\" section for details.51 Coinsurance for In-Network and Out-of-Network Benefits for PEIA PPB Plans If you live in WV, you will pay:If you live in a bordering county of a surrounding state, you will pay:If you live out-of-state (beyond bordering counties), you will pay: care in a bordering county of a surrounding state using PPO providers*Plan A: 20% - side WV (beyond bordering coun - ties) using PPO providers with prior approval* (Higher of Benefit)Plan A: - yond bordering counties) using non-PPO pro - viders with prior approval*Plan A: 30% coinsurance + amounts that exceed the Reasonable and Customary amount.

You are re - sponsible for 100% of the provider's charges, except if the care is the result of a medical emergency. PEIA PPB Plan D has NO coverage for out-of-state services. Plan D members cannot receive services outside WV, except in a medical emergency or when UMR determines that a needed service is not available within WV. In these cases, out-of-state care is covered as in-network care. *Prior approval is generally only provided if services are not available in West Virginia. The PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D are designed to provide as much care as possible within the State of West Virginia. The PEIA Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) is made up of West Virginia health care providers who provide health care services or supplies to PEIA partici - pants. For services provided outside of the State, PEIA uses UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus Preferred Provider Organization.52 Resident PPB Plan Participants PEIA PPB Plan A & B participants who live in West Virginia or a bordering county of a sur - rounding state may access care from any West Virginia health care provider who provides health care services or supplies to a PEIA participant, or any network provider located in those bordering counties without prior approval. All services provided outside of West Virginia beyond the bordering counties require prior approval to be paid at the highest ben - efit level. For services of network providers, the plan will pay its portion of the contracted payment rate, and you will be responsible for any copayments, deductible, coinsurance, and non-covered services. For services of out-of-state (beyond the contiguous counties) in-network providers without ap - proval in advance from UMR, the plan will pay of its portion of the contracted rate and you will be responsible for any deductible, a $500 copayment for unapproved out-of-state care, and coinsurance. These are OOSINNA services and are considered the lower level of benefit. For services of out-of-state, non-network providers without prior approval, the plan will pay nothing, unless the services are provided as a result of a medical emergency or because the necessary care is not available from an in-network provider, in which case the services will be paid at the in-network benefit level. For non-emergent services of out-of-state non-net - work providers without prior approval, you will be responsible for 100% of billed charges, and those amounts are considered non-covered services, so they do not count toward the de - ductible or out-of-pocket maximum. PEIA PPB Plan D members must be WV residents and may use ONLY WV providers. PEIA PPB Plan D participants may access care from any West Virginia health care provider who provides health care services or supplies to a PEIA participant, without prior approval. Services provided outside of West Virginia are not covered, except if provided as a result of a medical emergency to stabilize the patient for transport back to WV, or if provided outside the state because necessary care is not available within WV. For services of WV providers, the plan will pay its portion of the contracted payments rate, and you will be responsible for any copayments, deductible, coinsurance, and non-covered services. PPB Plan participants traveling out-of-state have coverage for urgent and emergency care. In an emergency, seek treatment at the nearest facility that is able to provide the need - ed care, and that care will be paid at the in-network benefit level as an emergency . For non-emergency, urgent care, call UMR for a referral to a network provider, or for approval to see an out-of-network provider where you are. Non-resident PPB Plan Participants (PEIA PPB Plans A and B only) PEIA PPB Plan A & B participants who reside outside West Virginia and beyond the border - ing counties may access care using any network provider without prior approval, and the claims will be paid at the higher level of benefit (see chart on page 51) based on the con - tracted payment rate. You will be responsible for any copayment, deductible, coinsurance, and non-covered services. PEIA PPB Plan D participants must be WV residents. Care provided by non-network providers must be as a result of a medical emergency or have prior approval to be covered. Emergency or approved services of non-network providers will be paid at the in-network benefit level. Other out-of-state non-network services ARE NOT COVERED. Precertification requirements apply for inpatient stays and certain outpatient pro - cedures. PEIA PPB Plans A & B members please consult the preceding chart to determine your level of coinsurance based on where you reside, where you receive your services, and whether or not you obtain prior approval. Changes for non-covered services and applicable plan penalties, such as precertification penalties are your responsibility .53 BENEFIT DESIGN Covered in Full The following services are covered in full if in-network for all PEIA PPB Plans.

When a service is subject to a copayment only, you do not have to meet the deductible before the PEIA PPB Plan A, B & D begin to pay for that service. The copayment does not count toward your deductible or your out-of-pocket maximum. TYPE OF SERVICE YOUR IN -NETWORK COST Primary Care Physician Office Visits treat illness or injury$20 copayment per visit with no deductible Specialist Office Visit $40 copayment per visit with no deductible Out-of-State Primary Care Office Visits (In network)$20 copayment per visit with no deductible Second Surgical Opinions* $40 copayment per visit with no deductible Pain Management and Rehabilitative Outpatient Services Visits 1-20$20 copayment per visit with no deductible *No copayment if required by UMR. Copayment, Coinsurance and Deductible The services listed in the chart are subject to a copayment, annual deductible, and coinsurance. TYPE OF SERVICE YOUR IN -NETWORK COST Inpatient Hospital Stay $100 copay + deductible and coinsurance Emergency Services (including supplies) $100 copayment + deductible and coinsur - ance. An additional $500 copay will apply to claims for injuries resulting from high risk behaviors. Non-emergency services at emergency room*$100 copayment + deductible and coinsurance surgery/Outpatient surgery (facility-based)$100 copayment + deductible and coinsurance Bariatric surgery and dental procedures $500 copayment + deductible and coinsurance Outpatient Therapy Services visits 1-20 $10 copayment + deductible and coinsurance Outpatient Therapy Services visits 21 + $25 copayment + deductible and coinsurance Out-of-Network transplant services Deductible + coinsurance + additional $10,000 deductible * Non-emergency services received at the emergency room are very expensive to the PEIA Plans. Members who visit the emergency room for non-emergency services an excessive number of times may be placed on Complex Condition CARE or otherwise have payment for their ER services restricted or terminat - ed by the PEIA Plans.58 Coinsurance and Deductible and Higher/Lower Level of Benefits Services not listed in the three preceding charts are covered after the deductible is met. The coinsurance amounts are shown in the chart below: In WV and within contiguous counties*In-Network Outside WV WITH Approval from UMR* Higher Level of BenefitOut-of-State, In-Network Not Approved by UMR (OOSINNA) Lower Level of BenefitOut-of-network Outside WV WITHOUT Approval from UMR Plan A 80/20 70/30 60/40 Not Covered Plan B 70/30 65/35 50/50 Not Covered Plan D 80/20** 70/30 Not Covered Not Covered You pay your deductible, coinsurance, and any charges for services not covered by the plan directly to your health care provider. * Boyd County, Kentucky, and Washington County, Ohio, are excluded. ** Contiguous counties are not covered in Plan D. Medical Out-of-Pocket Maximum The medical out-of-pocket maximum is the most you pay in coinsurance in a plan year . Amounts you pay toward your annual deductibles, for copayments, for precertification pen - alties, for prescription drugs, for amounts billed in excess of what PEIA pays to non-network providers, and for services that are not covered under the plan do not apply toward your annual medical out-of-pocket maximum. It includes only your medical charges; prescriptions are handled separately. See the \"Prescription Drug Benefit\" section for details. The family out-of-pocket maximum is divided up among the family members. No one mem - ber of the family will pay more than the individual out-of-pocket maximum (see the single out-of-pocket maximum in the chart below). Once one person has met the individual out-of- pocket maximum, the plan will pay 100% of that person's covered charges (less applicable copayments). When another member of the family meets the balance of the family out-of- pocket maximum, then the plan will pay 100% of covered charges (less applicable copay - ments) on the entire family for the balance of the plan year. Alternatively, all members of the family may contribute to the family out-of-pocket maximum with no one person meeting the individual out-of-pocket maximum; once the family out-of-pocket maximum is met, the plan will pay 100% of covered charges (less applicable copayments) on all members of the family. Your out-of-pocket maximum amount depends on your employment status, your salary, your tier of coverage, where you receive your services, whether your provider is in the PEIA PPO network, and whether you have prior approval for out-of-pocket care. Amounts paid toward the out-of-network, out-of-pocket maximum will also count toward the in-network, out-of-pocket maximum, but in-network amounts do not count toward the out-of- network, out-of-pocket maximum. Out-of-network, out-of-pocket maximums are twice the amount of the in-network, out-of-pocket maximums. The following chart shows the out-of- pocket maximums.59 OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM AMOUNTS Employee Status Employee's Annual SalaryAnnual In- network Out- of-Pocket MaximumAnnual of-State w/o Approval* Out-of-Pocket Maximum PEIA PPB Plans A and D (Active, State Agency, Colleges and Universities, Board of Education)$0 (state agencies, col - leges, universities and county boards of education)Not Applicable $3,000/single; $6,000/family$6,000/single; $12,000/family Non-State Plan B Not Applicable A Not Applicable Plan B Not Applicable $3,000/single; $6,000/family$6,000/single; $12,000/family Deputy Sheriff's Early Retirement Plan A Not Applicable $2,500/single; $5,000/family$5,000/single; $10,000/family Deputy Sheriff's Early Retirement Plan B Not Applicable $3,000/single; $6,000/family$6,000/single; $12,000/family State-funded Elected $2,500/single; $5,000/family$5,000/single; $10,000/family State-funded *PEIA PPB Plan D has no out-of-network or out-of-state benefit, so this column does not apply to Plan D members.60 Benefit Maximums For certain types of services, the plan will pay up to a set amount per plan year as shown below. Patients experiencing a severe medical episode and patients with very complicated medical conditions are assigned a nurse case manager. For catastrophic cases involving serious long-term illness or injury resulting in loss or impaired function requiring medically necessary therapeutic intervention, the case manager may, based on medical documenta - tion, recommend additional treatment for services marked with an asterisk (*). For details of these benefits, see \"What Is Covered\" later in this section. All services listed below must be medically necessary; otherwise, they are not covered. ANNUAL BENEFIT MAXIMUMS Type of Service Benefit Maximum (per member per plan year) Christian Science Treatment $1,000 Inpatient Rehabilitation 150 Days Skilled Nursing Facility 100 Days Lifetime Maximum The PEIA PPB Plans have no lifetime maximum. PEIA PPB Plan Fee Schedules and Rates The PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D pay health care providers according to a maximum fee sched - ule and rates established by PEIA. If a provider's charge is higher than the PEIA maximum fee for a particular service, then the plan will allow only the maximum fee. The \"allowed amount\" for a particular service will be the lower of the provider 's charge or the PEIA maxi - mum fee. Physicians and other health care professionals are paid according to a Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) fee schedule. This type of payment system sets fees for professional medical services based on the relative amount of work, practice expense and malpractice insurance expense involved. These rates are adjusted annually. West Virginia physicians who treat PEIA patients must accept PEIA's allowed amount as payment in full; they may not bill additional amounts to PEIA patients. Most inpatient hospital services are paid on a \"prospective\" basis. PEIA 's reimbursement to hospitals is based on Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs), which is the system used by Medicare. It is a Prospective Payment System (PPS) that classifies medical cases and sur - gical procedures on the basis of diagnoses. Under this system, West Virginia hospitals know in advance what PEIA will pay per day or per admission. West Virginia hospitals have been provided specific information about their reimbursement rates from PEIA. These rates are also adjusted annually. Many outpatient hospital services are also paid on a prospective basis. PEIA has adopted a modified version of Medicare's Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). OPPS reimbursement is based on Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) groups. APCs include groups of services that are similar clinically, and require similar resources. These rates are adjusted annually.61 Pre-Service Decisions The PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D require that certain services and/or items be reviewed in advance to determine whether they are medically necessary and being provided in the most appropriate setting by a network provider, if possible. PEIA has three different types of pre-service determinations: prior approval, precertification/notification and preauthorization which are described on the next few pages. Important things to remember about pre-service decisions: Requests for pre-service decisions should be submitted to UMR, as early as possible, in advance of the service/item. Services or items may be approved or denied in whole or in part. One or more of the pre-service determinations may be required depending on the type of service or item. Check with UMR to see if your provider is in-network. For example, a hospital admission, the procedure to be performed and/or each physician' s services may require pre-service determinations, particularly if any of these is an out-of- state network provider, a non-network provider or the service is covered only under limited circumstances. Each type of pre-service requirement is described below. If you have questions, please call UMR. Prior Approval for Out-of-State Services in PEIA PPB Plans A & B (Mandatory) If you are in PEIA PPB Plan A or B and live in West Virginia or a bordering county of a sur - rounding state, all services outside of the State beyond the bordering counties must have prior approval. For services at preferred providers with prior approval, the plan will pay at the higher benefit level; you will be responsible for any deductible, copayments and coinsurance (see chart on page 51). For services for all members provided by out-of-state, in-network providers without prior ap - proval, the plan will pay the lower OOSINNA benefit. You will be responsible for any deduct - ible, copayments, and coinsurance. Any amount which exceeds PEIA's maximum allowance will be your responsibility. Those amounts are considered non-covered services. They do not count toward the deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. Out-of-state, non-network services are covered only in the case of an emergency or if ap - proved in advance by UMR. All other out-of-state, non-network services are not covered . You will be responsible for 100% of billed charges. Those amounts are considered non-cov - ered services. They do not count toward the deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. Special arrangements have been made for PEIA PPB Plans A & B participants who live more than one county beyond the borders of West Virginia. See \"Non-resident PPB Plan Participants\" on page 48 for more details. PEIA Plan D members have no benefit for out-of-state or out-of-network services, except in the case of a medical emergency which occurs out-of-state, or for the limited number of ser - vices not available within West Virginia. For services not available in West Virginia, UMR will direct the member to an out-of-state network facility capable of providing the needed services.62 Precertification/Notification Requirements Precertification of certain services (Mandatory) The PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D require that certain services and/or types of services be re - viewed to determine whether they are medically necessary and to evaluate the necessity for Complex Condition CARE. Some services require \"precertification,\" and other services require \"notification.\" Precertification is performed to determine if the admission/service is medically necessary and appropriate based on the patient's documented medical condition. Precertification is required for the following: 1. All admissions to out-of-state hospitals/facilities 2. All admissions to rehabilitation or skilled nursing facilities 3. Ambulance Service for Non-Emergency transport, including air ambulance 4. Any potentially experimental/investigational procedure, medical device, or treatment 5. Autism Spectrum Disorder services 6. Chelation Therapy 7. Chemotherapy Drugs 8. Continuous glucose monitors 9. Durable medical equipment purchases and/or rentals of $500 per month rental or $1500 per purchase or more 10. Elective (non-emergent) facility to facility air ambulance transportation 11. Electroconvulsive shock therapy (ECT) and Trans magnetic stimulation (TMS) 12. Genetic testing with the exception of Cologuard 13. Heart Perfusion Imaging 14. Home health care and/or IV therapy in the home after the twelfth visit. 15. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) 16. Insulin Pumps (except Omnipod DASH insulin delivery systems which are covered under the Prescription Drug Program and do not require prior authorization with standard quantity limits) 17. Outpatient CTA (CT angiography) 18. Outpatient Dialysis Services 19. Outpatient IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy) 20. Outpatient MRI scan of the breast 21. Residential substance abuse treatment (is only covered in the state of WV) 22. Sleep studies, services and equipment. See section on \"sleep management ser - vices\" on page 74 23.

Stereotactic Radiation Surgery and Stereotactic Radiation Therapy 26. Surgeries a) artificial disc surgery b) bariatric surgery c) cochlear implants or implantable interosseous devices (including bone-anchored) d) discectomy with spinal fusion surgery e) potentially cosmetic surgeries including but not limited to abdominoplasty, blepharoplasty, breast reduction, breast reconstruction, varicose f) endoscopic treatment GERD g) hysterectomy h) implantable devices which include: implantable pumps, electrical stimulators, implanted spinal drug delivery systems, neuromuscular stimulators, bone growth stimulators and mechanical heart valves i) knee arthroscopy j) laminectomy, including laminectomy with spinal fusion surgery k) spinal fusion surgery l) total joint replacement m) transplants n) uvulopalatopharyngoplasty o) vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, and sacroplasty 27. Transplants and transplant evaluations (including but not limited to: kidney, liver, heart, lung and pancreas, small bowel, and bone marrow replacement or stem cell transfer after high dose chemotherapy) Notification Notification to UMR is required to evaluate the admission/service in order to determine if the patient's medical condition will require Complex Condition CARE, such as discharge planning for home health care services. Notification to UMR is required for the following services in WV: 1. Inpatient medical (non-surgical), 2. Inpatient surgical admissions (except those specifically listed as requiring precertification), 3. Inpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment 4. Maternity and newborn, and 5. Partial/day mental health or substance abuse treatment programs Failure to pre-certify or notify UMR of an admission within the timeframes specified in the following chart will result in a reduction of benefits under the PPB Plan of 30%. This 30% penalty will be the responsibility of network providers. For all non-network providers, this 30% penalty will be the responsibility of the insured in addition to any applicable copayments, coinsurance, deductible, and amounts that exceed PEIA's maximum allowance. If the insured or provider feels that UMR inappropriately denied an admission or that exten - uating circumstances existed that prevented notification to UMR within the timeframes set forth, the insured or provider may file an appeal. Exception: It is the patient's responsibility to pre-certify inpatient stays and outpatient pro - cedures when these services are received out-of-network. If you do not pre-certify these out-of-network services, you must pay the 30% precertification penalty in addition to the out- of-network copayment, coinsurance, deductible and amounts that exceed PEIA 's Maximum allowance. Prior approval to use out-of-network providers does not pre-certify services. (Out- of-network care is only covered for emergency or if prior approval is received.)64 TIMELY PRECERTIFICATION/NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS Type of Admission Advance Notice Required Scheduled: Planned inpatient admission Within 2 business days of admission Inpatient or outpatient elective surgery or procedure3 business days in advance for procedures re - quiring precertification. For inpatient notification only, see above. Maternity (notify UMR during your first trimester) Term pregnancy Within 2 business days of admission Caesarean section (planned) Within 2 business days of admission Caesarean section (emergency) Within 2 business days of admission Other Admissions Urgent/Emergency service or procedure Within 2 business days of admission Preauthorization (Voluntary) Preauthorization is a voluntary process which allows you to contact UMR in advance of a procedure to verify that the service is a covered benefit and medically necessary so that you can make an informed decision about the procedure. To obtain preauthorization, ask your provider to submit the request electronically through UMR's iExchange portal or send your request to: UMR P.O. Box 30541 Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0541 Your provider should include your name, address, telephone number, your ID number, and all information about the procedure that's recommended. UMR may contact your physician for more information. Remember, if your request for preauthorization is denied, you will be responsible for paying for the service or procedure if you choose to have it. Medical Complex Condition CARE If you are experiencing a serious or long-term illness or injury , UMR program can help you learn about available resources, provide early support for your family , and find ways to con - tain medical costs, including your out-of-pocket expenses. Through Complex Condition CARE UMR can: arrange home care to prevent hospitalization; arrange services in the home to facilitate early hospital discharge; coordinate care and benefits for transplant services; obtain discounts for special medical equipment; locate appropriate services to meet the patient's health care needs; for catastrophic cases, when medically proven as a part of a comprehensive plan of care, allow additional visits for outpatient mental health or outpatient therapy services.65 For catastrophic cases involving serious long-term illness or injury resulting in loss or im - paired function requiring medically necessary therapeutic intervention, the UMR case man - ager may, based on medical documentation, recommend additional treatment for certain therapy services. For details of these benefits, see \"What Is Covered\" later in this section beginning on page 66. Transition of Care Program (New Participants Only) If you are new to the PEIA PPB Plan and have been receiving medical treatment from an out of state provider, you may be concerned that your care will be interrupted in your move to this Plan. To assist participants receiving treatment for serious medical conditions from out- of-state or out-of-network providers, PEIA has a Transition of Care (TOC) program. If you qualify for TOC, you can continue to receive medical treatment from a non-network provider during a transition period specified by UMR and be covered at the in-network benefit level. Following this transition period or after your treatment is complete your medical care must be provided by a network provider to be eligible for the higher in-network level of benefits. Not all conditions will qualify for the TOC program. Medical conditions likely to qualify for TOC benefits include: pregnancy, recent acute heart attack, newly diagnosed cancer requiring surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy, total joint replacement requiring physical therapy, acute trauma such as a bone fracture, certain psychiatric treatment or substance abuse programs, and recent surgical procedures with complications. Medical conditions which are not likely to qualify for TOC benefits include: arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and/or allergies. In most cases, a network provider can successfully treat these chronic conditions. If there is not a network provider available to treat your specific illness or condition, UMR will work with you to provide that care. Conditions limited or excluded from coverage are not eligible for TOC benefits. To apply for the TOC program, request a copy of the TOC form by calling 1-888-440-7342 and submit the completed form to UMR as indicated on the form. A separate form must be completed for each out-of-network provider. You will receive a written determination on your request for TOC benefits from the medical management department at UMR. You must ap - ply for TOC within three months of your effective date of coverage in Plan A or B.66 WHAT IS COVERED: MEDICALLY-NECESSARY SERVICES Covered services must be medically necessary or be one of the specifically listed preventive care benefits. Medically-necessary health care services and supplies are those provided by a hospital, phy - sician or other licensed health care provider to treat an injury , illness or medical condition. A service is considered medically necessary if it is: consistent with the diagnosis and treatment of the illness or injury; in keeping with generally accepted medical practice standards; not solely for the convenience of the patient, family or health care provider; not for custodial, comfort or maintenance purposes; rendered in the most cost-efficient setting and level appropriate for the condition; and not otherwise excluded from coverage under the PEIA PPB Plans. The fact that a physician has recommended a service as medically necessary does not make the charge a covered expense. PEIA reserves the right to make the final determination of medical necessity based on diagnosis and supporting medical data. Who May Provide Services The PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D will pay for covered services rendered by a health care profes - sional or facility if the provider is: licensed or certified under the law of the jurisdiction in which the care is rendered; providing treatment within the scope or limitation of the license or certification; not under sanction by Medicare, Medicaid or both. Services of providers under sanction will be denied for the duration of the sanction; and not excluded by PEIA due to adverse audit findings. Types of Services Covered PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D cover a wide range of health care services. Some major catego - ries are listed below. The description of each service includes the level of coinsurance and any applicable copayments you must pay when the service is received from a provider who participates in the PEIA PPO within the State of West Virginia (or in bordering counties of the surrounding states for PEIA PPB Plan A & B members only). If you have questions about coverage of services, call UMR at 1-888-440-7342 .

Comprehensive Care Partnership (CCP) Program PEIA offers a healthcare program that allows you to receive primary care services while paying less. This program, called the Comprehensive Care Partnership (CCP) program, is designed to promote quality of care, preventive services and appropriate use of health ser - vices to identify health problems early and maintain control of chronic conditions. This bene - fit option is available to PEIA PPB Plan A, B and D insureds. Members who enroll in the CCP Program will pay less for specified services at their CCP provider. CCP providers are expected to provide primary care services, coordination of care, and some CCP locations also provide specialty care services and/or laboratory services. If a CCP member uses a primary care provider outside the CCP, they may pay a higher copay. The purpose of the CCP is to promote the use of health services to keep the patient well, identify health problems early, maintain control of chronic conditions and to promote efficient utilization of healthcare resources. As such, the following is required of the CCP provider: Remind you when services are due; Perform an initial evaluation to include an assessment of your preventive health care services and overall health status; Provide the information you need to care for yourself; Maintain an electronic medical record, which includes a summary of key health and preventive care history, medicines, and a provision for delivering such information to you as needed; Provide 24-hour telephone access to a medical provider; Coordinate with specialists to ensure that all information and treatment plans are consistent; Notify you of any changes to covered services; Notify PEIA of non-compliant members who should be removed from the program. Members enrolled in the CCP program agree to receive their primary healthcare from the CCP provider. Enrolled members pay less for specified services provided at their CCP location. Please note, each plan member must enroll individually for the CCP program. 76 A separate enrollment form must be completed for each individual plan member or the infor - mation for the specific member's provider must be updated on \"Manage My Benefits\" . The success of the program requires a working partnership between the CCP provider and the patient/member. Participating members agree to: Use their chosen CCP provider for all health care available at their designed CCP. Contact their CCP provider before receiving medical care from providers with the exception of emergency cases. Participate in initial and regular health assessment at least every two years. The purpose of the assessment is to collect the health history and clinical data needed to identify the pre - ventive services needed, plan the patient's care, and address all healthcare questions. Members who do not comply with the requirements of the program may be disenrolled. NOTE: If you want to continue using other primary care providers and/or specialists for much of your health care, the CCP may not be for you. To enroll in the CCP program, simply: Review the Provider Directory on UMR's website at umr.com and choose the provider loca - tion to serve as your CCP provider; Click on the green \" Manage My Benefits \" button in the upper right corner, register on the site or use your existing credentials to log-in and choose your CCP provider; Or complete the CCP program enrollment form from the website, note the CCP location of choice and the seven-digit provider ID number, then sign it and return it to PEIA at the ad - dress provided, or you may give it to a receptionist at one of the health centers; Your CCP will be effective the first day of the month following receipt of your completed enrollment form, if it is received no later than the 25th. If the form is received after the 25th, then enrollment may be delayed a month. Ongoing Condition CARE Program The Ongoing Condition CARE program identifies those individuals who have certain chronic diseases and would benefit from this program. Specially trained nurses work telephonically with members to help them improve their chronic diseases and maintain quality of life. UMR supports individuals with one or more of the nine targeted chronic categories: 1. Behavioral Health Disorders 2. Blood Disorders 3. Cardiovascular Disorders 4. Endocrine Disorders 5. Gastrointestinal Disorders 6. Genitourinary Disorders 7. Neuromuscular/Autoimmune Disorders 8. Oncology 9. Respiratory Disorders Identified members are invited to participate in the appropriate Ongoing Condition CARE pro - gram, and then work with specially trained nurses through phone calls and printed materials to learn more about their condition and how to manage it. In addition to the telephonic services, UMR Ongoing Condition CARE also provides HealtheNotes. These targeted mailings are sent to members' homes and to their health care providers. They identify chronic condition gaps in care and include information on ways to prevent long-term issues and avoid health care costs. HealtheNotes provide useful, personalized information based on an individual member 's health care utilization, including information on provider visits, prescriptions, and health screenings. HealtheNotes is an educational tool in the Ongoing Condition CARE Program for managing a member's chronic condition(s).77 Hemophilia Disease Management Program To provide quality care at a reasonable cost, PEIA has partnered with the Charleston Area Medical Center (CAMC) and West Virginia University Hospitals (WVUH) to provide a Hemophilia Care Program to PEIA PPB Plan members. Members who participate in the pro - gram will be eligible for the following benefits: An annual evaluation by specialists in the Hemophilia Disease Management Program which will be paid at 100% with no deductible, copay or coinsurance. (This evaluation is not intended to replace, or interrupt care provided by your existing provider or special - ists. This evaluation does not include routine or sick care visits with your doctor or ER). Hemophilia factor expenses incurred at CAMC or WVUH will be paid at 100% with no deductible, copay or coinsurance. Reimbursement for travel and lodging for an annual evaluation a) Child and 1 or 2 parents b) Adult and an accompanying adult c) Lodging will be at an approved hotel for a maximum of two (2) nights for one room only. d) Gas will be reimbursed at the IRS medical rate for one vehicle only . e) Receipts for food will be paid at 100% for the child and parents or for the 2 adults. Lodging and Travel Expenses: Lodging expenses include: a) Expenses incurred by the patient traveling between his or her home and the participating facility to receive services in connection with the Hemophilia Disease Management Program. b) Expenses incurred by the patient's companion to enable the patient to receive services from the Hemophilia Disease Management Program. 1. For children under the age of 18, lodging will be covered for one (1) or two (2) parents. 2. For patients over the age of 18, lodging will be covered for one (1) companion. Lodging will be covered at 100% of the charge up to $107.00 per night. Travel expenses (gas & meals) include: 1.

Send claims for lodging and travel expenses to the following address: UMR 4700 MacCorkle Ave, SE Suite 104 Charleston, WV 25304 For more information about this program please contact: UMR at 1-888-440-7342 .78 Maternity Benefits The PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D provide coverage for maternity-related professional and facility services, including prenatal care, midwife services and birthing centers. Maternity related services are covered for the employee and covered dependents. PEIA will cover certain medically-necessary genetic testing if the services are approved in advance by UMR. Contact UMR during the first trimester of your pregnancy or as soon as your pregnancy is confirmed to enroll in UMR's Maternity CARE program. UMR can assist you in identifying possible factors that may put you at risk for premature labor and delivery. If risk factors are identified, UMR nurses will work with you and your doctor to help safeguard the health of mother and baby. You will need to contact UMR anytime you are admitted to the hospital during your pregnancy and within 48 hours of your admission for delivery, even if you are discharged in less than 48 hours. Maternity CARE provides prenatal education and high-risk pregnancy identification to help mothers carry their babies to term. This program increases the number of healthy, full-term deliveries and decreases the cost of long-term hospital stays for both mothers and babies. Program members are contacted via telephone at least once each trimester and once post - partum. A comprehensive assessment is performed at that time to determine the member's risk level and educational needs. UMR's pre-pregnancy coaching program helps women learn about risks and take action to prevent serious and costly medical complications before they become pregnant. Women with pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, not only face risks to their babies, but also to themselves while they are pregnant. Members self-enroll in the pre-pregnancy coaching program by calling UMR's toll-free number. They are then contacted by nurse case managers who have extensive clinical backgrounds in obstetrics/gynecology . The nurses complete pre-pregnancy assessments to determine risk levels, if any , and pro - vide members with education and materials based on their needs. Payment Level Maternity services for routine prenatal care, delivery and follow-up are paid at 100% of al - lowed charges under a global fee after the deductible has been met. An obstetrical profile and one ultrasound are also paid at 100% of allowed charges under a global fee after the de - ductible has been met. Other maternity services, including hospital charges and anesthesia services, are paid with applicable coinsurance after the deductible is met, for in-network care. Maternity Pre-Payment Benefit If your attending provider requests a deposit for maternity care before delivery , PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D will make an advance payment of up to $500. This will be deducted from the global fee paid after delivery. To receive this benefit, please contact UMR and request a Maternity Pre-payment form.79 High-Risk Birth Score Program For infants identified at birth as being at risk for health problems, PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D will pay for six office visits between the age of two weeks and 24 months in addition to PEIA 's regular Well Child Care benefits. These additional visits are paid at 100% of allowed charges and are not subject to the deductible. UMR will notify those families who qualify for this benefit. Enrolling Your Newborn Please be sure you remember to add your newborn to your PEIA PPB Plan coverage by log - ging in to peia.wv.gov under Manage My Benefits. Nursery Charges If the baby is enrolled for coverage under the PEIA PPB Plan A,B, or D, charges for the new - born nursery care will be paid in the baby's name. If the baby is not enrolled for coverage under the Plan, only charges for a normal, healthy newborn's nursery care will be covered if billed as part of the mother's maternity benefit, and all other claims will be denied. If the new - born is covered under another plan, coordination of benefits rules will apply . Statement of Rights Under the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act PEIA is required by law to provide you with the following statement of rights. PEIA's mater - nity benefit meets or exceeds all of the requirements of the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act. Under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage generally may not restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in con - nection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours following a vag - inal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a delivery by Cesarean section. However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the attending provider (e.g., your physician, nurse midwife, or physician assistant), after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, under federal law, plans and issuers may not set the level of benefits or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the 48-hour (or 96-hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require that a physician or other health care provider obtain authorization for prescribing a length of stay of up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain providers or facilities, or to reduce your out-of-pock - et costs, you may be required to obtain precertification. For information on precertification, contact your plan administrator. Organ Transplant Benefits Organ transplants are covered when deemed medically necessary and non-experimental. They are subject to precertification and Complex Condition CARE by UMR. You should contact UMR as soon as your doctor determines you or a member of your family covered by PEIA PPB Plans A, B or D may need a transplant. All transplants require precertification for determination of medical necessity. You should advise your physician that UMR needs to coordinate the care from the initial phase when considering a transplant procedure, initial 80 workup for transplant through the performance of the procedure and the care following the actual transplant. Any services and supplies that are required for donor/procurement as a result of a surgical transplant procedure for a participant will be covered. Benefits for such charges, services and supplies are not provided under the PPB Plan if benefits are provided under another group plan or any other group or individual contract or any arrangement of coverage for individuals in a group (whether an insured or uninsured basis), including any prepayment coverage. Testing for persons other than the chosen donor is not covered. Organ Transplant Network (OTN) The PEIA PPB Plan uses a network of providers for organ transplant services. This helps to control health care costs for both you and the plan. PEIA's primary OTN facilities are: University of Kentucky's UK HealthCare Cleveland Clinic WVU Hospital for bone marrow and heart transplant Charleston Area Medical Center (CAMC) for kidney For services not available at these facilities, PEIA uses the Optum transplant network. UMR will work with patients and physicians to determine which facility best serves the patient's medical needs. OTN Benefits Reduced Costs: Once the annual deductible and out-of-pocket maximum have been met, you will pay no more coinsurance on the negotiated fees for pre-transplant, transplant, and follow-up services. Copayments for office visits and other services described on page 57 will still apply. Travel Allowance: Because network facilities may be located some distance from the pa - tient's home, reimbursement benefits include up to $5,000 per transplant for patient travel, lodging and meals related to visits to the transplant facility or physician. A portion of this benefit is available to cover the travel, lodging and meals for a member of the patient' s family or a friend providing support. Receipts are required for payment of meals and lodging; cost estimates are not acceptable. No alcoholic beverages will be reimbursed. Mileage will be reimbursed at the federal mileage rate for medical expenses. NOTE: To seek reimbursement for transplant-related travel expenses, use the Medical Claim Form on peia.wv.gov and submit the form to UMR, the third-party administrator. All claims must be submitted within the six-month timely filing period, including the submission of all lodging and travel expenses. Medical Complex Condition CARE: UMR offers support and assistance in evaluating treat - ment options and referrals to the prescription drug administrator . Management begins early when the potential need for a transplant is identified and continues through the surgery and follow-up. When the need for a transplant presents itself, call UMR at 1-888-440-7342 . You should contact UMR as soon as you learn that you or a member of your family covered by PEIA PPB Plans A, B or D may need a transplant. All transplants must be pre-certified through UMR.81 Out-of-Network Organ Transplant Benefits For patients who choose to use a non-network facility for transplant services, there is no coverage for out-of-network facilities, unless approved in advance by UMR. No travel ben - efits will be provided for out-of-network transplants (except medically-necessary ambulance transport). Transplant-Related Prescription Drugs PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D cover transplant-related immunosuppressant prescription drugs at 100%, after you have met your prescription drug deductible. Medical Complex Condition CARE of transplant patients includes referral to the prescription drug administrator for waiver of copayment on transplant-related immunosuppressant drugs. UMR will make arrangements with the prescription drug administrator to waive copayments on drugs used to sustain the transplant. Sleep Management Services The PEIA PPB Plans cover services for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea and other sleep-related conditions that can affect your health. To ensure compliance and to ad - minister prescribed sleep services at the highest quality, a precertification process has been established to qualify services as medically necessary and appropriate. PEIA requires that the ordering physician request approval from UMR prior to a member receiving sleep ser - vices that include sleep testing and sleep therapy. Using evidence-based guidelines, UMR will review the request for a sleep study and make recommendations for those studies that can be performed in the member's home. In addition to managing sleep testing services, UMR also manages P AP therapy services by providing prior approval for PAP therapy requests. The servicing provider will provide com - prehensive support for members' prescribed PAP therapy to provide assistance with adher - ence to therapy. UMR will monitor compliance for the first 90 days before the equipment is purchased. To obtain prior authorization for sleep services, you may call UMR at 1-888-440-7342 .) Specialty Drug Program PEIA's Specialty Drug Program has two components: 1. Specialty Injectable Drugs are administered by injection or infusion, and are managed by UMR through the medical benefit. 2. Common Specialty Medications are self-administered, and are managed through the Express Scripts Accredo Specialty Pharmacy. Specialty Injectable Drugs are prescription drugs used to treat complex, chronic, or rare medical conditions (e.g., cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, HIV, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and hepatitis). Drugs in this category are typically administered by injection or infusion. Specialty Injectables often require special handling (e.g., refrigeration) and ongoing clinical monitoring. The PEIA PPB Plans cover specialty injectable drugs through a program managed by UMR. The program provides comprehensive direction to policyholders and their dependents for treatments utilizing specialty drugs. If your physician prescribes a specialty drug, that physician, you, or the 82 pharmacist must call UMR at 1-888-440-7342 . The Specialty Injectable Drug list is located at https://www.umrwebapps.com/SpecialtyInjectable/77700000 . To obtain a paper copy, call 1-888-680-7342 . UMR will review the drug for medical necessity If denied, UMR will contact your physician for additional information which may allow approval of the requested medication. Common Specialty Medications are self-administered specialty injectable or oral drugs purchased through the Express Scripts Accredo Specialty Pharmacy. Through the Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, you will be assigned a dedicated Care Team with specialists in your condition. These specialists will check in to see what you need and how they can help mov - ing forward. They'll also make arrangements for injection training, as needed. If your physi - cian prescribes a common specialty drug, they can call 1-800-803-2523 , fax 1-888-302-1028 , or e-prescribe the specialty drug to the Accredo Specialty Pharmacy. The Accredo Specialty Pharmacy will then work with your doctor to obtain prior authorization for the specialty medi - cation. Once approved, you can have your specialty medications delivered directly to you. Many specialty medications have manufacturer programs which will financially assist patients in the purchase of the medication. PEIA requires that if a financial assistance program is available, you must participate in the program. Only your actual out-of-pocket payments will count toward your drug deductible and annual out-of-pocket maximum; not amounts dis - counted off the price by the manufacturer or seller of the specialty medication. Travel Benefits If a covered PEIA participant travels more than 60 miles, one-way, from their home, to re - ceive care in West Virginia, the PPB Plan will reimburse the policyholder some of the travel expenses related to their medical care. Limitations and requirements: Only mileage and tolls are covered. This also applies to rideshare companies (for exam - ple Lyft/Uber). Only mileage and tolls are covered. Mileage will be reimbursed at the federal mileage rate for medical expenses in effect for the time period. You must provide receipts for tolls. Travel must be on the same day as the medical procedure. Other travel related expenses are not covered. Benefit is only for care and services received at providers in West Virginia. Travel to providers outside of West Virginia is not covered except as specified in the Summary Plan Description. Maximum reimbursement shall not exceed $250 per benefit year. NOTE: To seek reimbursement for travel expenses, use the Medical Travel Expense Reimbursement Request Form on peia.wv.gov, and submit the form to UMR, PO Box 3054, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0541. All claims must be submitted within the six-month timely filing period, including the submission of all lodging and travel expenses.83 HEALTHY TOMORROWS Wellness Pilot Programs From time to time PEIA offers limited wellness pilot programs or initiatives for members in the PEIA PPB Plans. Policyholders are encouraged to visit the PEIA website frequently or keep their e-mail address up to date in the Manage My Benefits system to assure they receive electronic notice of upcoming opportunities. Face-to-Face (F2F) Diabetes Program PEIA's F2F Diabetes Program is a statewide, two-year program for PPB Plan members (sub - ject to the availability of providers) open to active employees and non-Medicare retirees who have diabetes. Under the program, members and/or their dependents with diabetes or gestational diabetes agree to make regular visits to a participating provider of their choosing for counseling and health education services. The provider works with each member over the course of the two- year program to ensure he/she gets the best diabetes care possible by monitoring: a) recommended testing and treatment of diabetes; b) the member's currently prescribed medicines and knowledge about how to take them; and c) physical activity and nutrition plan to assist the member in achieving optimal health. New members enrolling in the F2F Diabetes program will have 12 months from the date of enrollment to get their HbA1c at a value of 8 or below, or reduce the value by 1.0 . Members benefit from participating in the F2F Diabetes program by improving their health and quality of life, and by saving money, since copayments are waived for generic and brand-preferred diabetes related prescription drugs, and/or supplies. Copayments are waived only at retail pharmacies, not mail order. Copayments are not waived on brand non-preferred prescription drugs. PEIA benefits from the member's better management of their disease through fewer health care costs from the disease or its complications. The F2F Diabetes Program has a maximum of either 24 months or two attempts per lifetime benefit. Members who either failed to comply or dropped out of the program may re-en - roll after a 12-month waiting period, which begins on the date PEIA disenrolls you from the program. For more information or an application, check the PEIA website, peia.wv.gov under Wellness Tools, or call PEIA Customer Service at 1-888-680-7342 . Weight Management Program PEIA offers a facility-based weight management program for PEIA PPB members who meet the program qualifications and are willing to make the necessary commitment to the program.

Tobacco Cessation PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D provide benefits for participants who wish to quit smoking or using smokeless tobacco products. Only those members who have been paying the Standard (to - bacco-user) premium are eligible for the Tobacco Cessation benefit. If you signed an affidavit claiming to be tobacco-free, you will be declined the Tobacco Cessation benefit. To access the benefits, simply visit your primary care provider. PEIA will cover an initial and follow-up visit to your physician or nurse practitioner. PEIA covers both prescription and non-prescription tobacco cessation medications if they are dispensed with a prescription. PEIA will cover two 12-week cycles of drug therapy, even if more than one type of therapy is used. If extended therapy is required, the provider must submit a written appeal to the Director of PEIA with proof of medical necessity. You can use the benefit (office visits and prescriptions) twice per year (rolling 12-month pe - riod). For pregnant participants, PEIA will provide 100% coverage for the tobacco cessation benefit during any pregnancy.

Work-related injury or illness89 HOW TO FILE A CLAIM Filing a Medical Claim Medical claims are processed by UMR and should be submitted to: UMR, P.O. Box 30541, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0541 This post office box should be used only for PEIA claims. Please do not submit PEIA claims to other UMR post office boxes. This will only delay their processing. To process a medical claim, UMR requires a complete itemization of charges including: the patient's name; the nature of the illness or injury; date(s) of service; type of service(s); charge for each service; diagnosis and procedure codes; identification number of the provider; and Medical ID number of the policyholder. If the necessary information is printed on your itemized bill, you do not need to use a PEIA claim form to submit your charges. Cash register receipts and canceled checks are not ac - ceptable proof of your claim. If you have other insurance which is primary, you need to submit an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the other insurance which shows the amount the primary insurance paid with each claim, or ask your provider to do so if the claim is being submitted for you. You have six (6) months from the date of service to file a medical claim. If PEIA is your sec - ondary insurer, you have six (6) months from the date of your primary insurer's Explanation of Benefits processing date to file your claim with PEIA. If you do not submit claims within this period, they will not be paid, and you will be responsible for payment to the provider. If your claim is for an illness or injury wrongfully or negligently caused by someone else, and you expect to be reimbursed by another party or insurance plan, you must file a claim with PEIA within six (6) months of the date of service to ensure that the covered services will be paid. Later, if you receive payment for the expenses, you will have to repay the amount you receive from PEIA. See \"Subrogation\" on page 124 for details. Filing Claims for Court-ordered Dependents (COD) If you are the custodial parent of a child who is covered under the other parent's PEIA plan as a result of a court order, you may submit claims directly to UMR using the special claim forms provided by PEIA. You can also receive all benefit information published by PEIA, and reimbursements for medical claims can be sent directly to you. For prescription drugs, you must use your I.D. card at a participating pharmacy. To make arrangements for this, please contact PEIA at 1-304-558-7850 , or 1-888-680-7342 . Claims Incurred Outside of the U.S.A. If you or a covered dependent incur medical expenses while outside the United States, you may be required to pay the provider yourself. Request an itemized bill containing all the in - formation listed above from your provider and submit the bill along with a claim form to UMR or the prescription drug administrator.90 PEIA is a Covered Entity under 45 CFR 160.103 and is required to be compliant with any and all applicable provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as well as other Privacy and Security laws, rules, and regulations enacted by the State of West Virginia or the United States, and not rules of the European Union. The European Union's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) does not apply to PEIA or its operations. UMR or the prescription drug administrator will determine, through a local banking institution, the currency exchange rate and you will be reimbursed according to the terms of the plan you're enrolled in. APPEALING A CLAIM PEIA PPB Plans If you are a PEIA PPB Plan participant or provider and think that an error has been made in processing your claim or reviewing a service, the first step is to call the Third-Party Administrator to verify that a mistake has been made. (For information about prescription drug appeals, see \"How to File a Claim\" on page 113). All appeals must be initiated within one hundred and twenty (120) days of claim payment or denial.

Explain what you think the problem is, and why you disagree with the decision. Please have your physician provide any additional relevant clinical information to support your request. Third- Party Administrator will respond to you by reprocessing the claim or sending you a letter.91 If this does not resolve the issue, the third step is to appeal in writing to the director of the PEIA. The participant, provider or covered dependent must request a review in writing within sixty (60) days of getting the decision from the Third-Party Administrator. Facts, issues, com - ments, letters, Explanations of Benefits (EOBs), and all pertinent information about the case should be included and mailed to: Director, Public Employees Insurance Agency, 601 57th Street, SE, Suite 2, Charleston, WV 25304-2345 When your request for review arrives, the PEIA will reconsider the entire case, taking into account any additional materials which have been provided. A decision, in writing, explaining the reason for modifying or upholding the original disposition of the claim will be sent to the insured or his or her authorized representative. If additional information is required to ren - der a decision, this information will be requested in writing. The additional information must be received within sixty (60) days of the date of the letter. If the additional information is not received, the case will be closed. External Review: If we have denied your request for the provision of or payment for a health care service or course of treatment, our decision may be reviewed by independent health care professionals who have no association with us if our decision involved making a judgment as to the medical necessity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of care or effectiveness of the health care service or treatment you requested. An external review may be initiated by us or requested by you. You may submit a request for external review within four (4) months after receipt of the notice of denial to the PEIA Clinical Unit, 601 57th Street, SE, Suite 2, Charleston, WV 25304-2345. For standard external review by your request, a decision will be made within forty-five (45) days of receiving your request. If you have a medical condition that would seriously jeopardize your life or health or would jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function if treatment is delayed, you may request an expedit - ed external review of our denial. If our denial to provide or pay for a health care service or course of treatment is based on a determination that the service or treatment is experimental or investigational, you also may request for an external review of our denial. External review is the final level of appeal, regardless of whether the external review was initiated by us or requested by you. External review is not available for items or treatments that are simply not covered by the Plan or for out-of-state benefit level appeals. Managed Care Plan Members If you are a managed care plan member, and you think that an error has been made in pro - cessing your claim, the first step is to call your managed care plan to discuss the matter . If your claim has been denied, or if you disagree with the determination made by your man - aged care plan, the second step is to appeal in writing within 120 days of the denial to your managed care plan. Instructions for filing that appeal are in your \"Evidence of Coverage\" provided by your managed care plan. If you are not satisfied with the response from your managed care plan, you may appeal in writing to the director of the PEIA. You or your covered dependents must request a review in writing within sixty (60) days of getting the decision from your managed care plan. Facts, is - sues, comments, letters, Explanations of Benefits (EOBs), and all pertinent information about the claim and review should be included.

A decision, in writing, explaining the reason for modifying or upholding the original disposition of the claim will be sent to the insured or his or her authorized representative. If additional information is required to render a decision, this information will be requested in writing. The additional information must be received within sixty (60) days of the date of the letter. If the additional information is not received, the case will be closed. If you disagree with the decision of the PEIA director, you have one final level of appeal to the West Virginia Insurance Commissioner. Instructions for this appeal are also provided in your \"Evidence of Coverage\" from your managed care plan. PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS Along with your PEIA PPB Plan medical coverage, you also have prescription drug coverage. The prescription drug program is administered by Express Scripts. There are three parts to the program: 1. The Retail Pharmacy Program gives you access to local participating pharmacies to get your prescription filled; 2. The Express Scripts Mail Service Pharmacy lets you order your prescriptions through the mail, saving you time and money by having your maintenance medications deliv - ered to your door; 3. Accredo, an Express Scripts Specialty Pharmacy, Program provides access to your common specialty medications through the mail, saving you time by having your medications delivered to your door or to your physician's office. Your prescription drug benefits pay for a wide range of medications, with differing copay - ments depending on where you purchase those drugs, and whether you purchase generic or brand-name drugs. What You Pay Deductible During any plan year, if you or your eligible dependents incur expenses for covered prescrip - tion drugs, you must meet a deductible before the plan begins to pay . The deductibles are: PRESCRIPTION DRUG DEDUCTIBLES PPB Plan A or D PPB Plan B Policyholder Only $75 $150 Policyholder & Child(ren) $300 Family $150 $300 Family with Employee Spouse$150 $30093 The family deductible is divided up among the family members. No one member of the family will pay more than the individual deductible. Once that person has met the individ - ual deductible, the plan will begin paying on that person. When another member of the family meets the individual deductible, then the plan will begin paying on the entire family. Alternatively, all members of the family may contribute to the family deductible with no one person meeting the individual deductible; once the family deductible is met, the plan pays on all members of the family. After you meet your deductible, you will pay copayments or coin - surance based on the amount and type of drug you're taking. The following chart shows the copayments and coinsurance. Copayments and Coinsurance Once you meet your deductible, you pay a copayment or coinsurance to obtain drugs. Copayments and coinsurance are the portion of the cost that you are required to pay per new or refill prescription. The rest of the cost is paid by PEIA. Several factors determine your copayment or coinsurance.

See the Maintenance Medications section for the list of qualifying medications. You must purchase all medications on the Maintenance Drug List in 90-day supplies through a Retail Maintenance Network pharmacy or through Mail Service. Read on for details. Should your doctor prescribe, or you request the brand-name Specialty Medication when a generic drug is available, you must pay 75% coinsurance. #Should your doctor prescribe, or you request the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available, you must pay 75% coinsurance.94 Generic Drugs The brand-name of a drug is the product name under which the drug is advertised and sold. Generic medications have the same active ingredients and are subject to the same rigid U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards for quality, strength and purity as their brand- name counterparts. Generic drugs usually cost less than brand-name drugs. Please ask your doctor to prescribe generic drugs whenever possible. West Virginia Preferred Drug List (WVPDL) The West Virginia Preferred Drug List (WVPDL) is a list of carefully selected medications that can assist in maintaining quality care while providing opportunities for cost savings to the member and the plan. Under this program, your plan requires you to pay a lower copayment for medications on the WVPDL and a higher copayment for medications not on the WVPDL. By asking your doctor to prescribe WVPDL medications, you can maintain high quality care while you help to control rising health-care costs. Here's how copayment structure works: Highest Cost: You will pay a 75% coinsurance for brand-name drugs that are not listed on the WVPDL. Middle Cost: You will pay a mid-level copayment for brand-name drugs that are listed on the WVPDL. Lowest Cost: You will pay the lowest copayment for generic drugs. Generic drugs are subject to the same rigid U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards for quality, strength and purity as their brand-name counterparts. Generic drugs usually cost less than brand-name drugs. Please ask your doctor to prescribe generic drugs for you whenever possible. Sometimes your doctor may prescribe a medication to be \"dispensed as written\" when a WVPDL brand-name or generic alternative drug is available. As part of your plan, an Express Scripts pharmacist or your retail pharmacist may discuss with your doctor whether an alternative formulary or generic drug might be appropriate for you. Your doctor always makes the final decision on your medication, and you can always choose to keep the original prescription at the higher copayment. Drugs on the WVPDL are determined by the Express Scripts Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The committee, made up of physicians, meets quarterly to review the medica - tions currently on the Formulary, and to evaluate new drugs for addition to the Formulary. The Formulary may change periodically, based on the recommendations adopted by the committee. If you have any questions, please call Express Scripts Customer Care at 1-855-224-6247 . Non-Preferred Drugs Non-preferred (tier 3) drugs are brand-name drugs that do not appear on the WVPDL. Non- preferred drugs require 75% coinsurance after the prescription drug deductible. If your doctor prescribes a non-preferred brand-name drug, and you have tried and failed on the generic and preferred brand-name alternatives offered by Express Scripts, your provider may file an appeal to lower your out-of-pocket cost. To file the appeal, your provider must submit medical justification, in writing, to: Express Scripts P.O. Box 14711 Lexington, KY 40512-471195 Your tier appeal, if approved by Express Scripts, will lower your out-of-pocket cost from 75% of the cost of the drug to the $25 preferred drug monthly copay. The decision by Express Scripts is final for both tier appeal approvals and denials. There is no further level of ap - peal for a tier exception. For more information about tier appeals, you may contact Express Scripts at 1-855-224-6247 . Prescription Out-of-Pocket Maximum PEIA has an out-of-pocket maximum on drugs of $1,750 for an individual and $3,500 for a family. Once you have met the out-of-pocket maximum, PEIA will cover the entire cost of your prescriptions for the balance of the plan year. The out-of-pocket maximum only includes actual copays and co-insurance, not deductibles or other charges, and is separate from your medical out-of-pocket maximum. Getting Your Prescriptions Filled Using a Retail Network Pharmacy Express Scripts has a nationwide network of pharmacies. To get a prescription filled, simply present your medical/prescription drug ID card at a participating Express Scripts network pharmacy. You can purchase acute medications at any Express Scripts network pharmacy. Maintenance medications must be purchased from a Retail Maintenance Network pharmacy or using the Express Scripts Mail Service Pharmacy Program (see below for details). You may refill your prescription when 75% of the medication is used up. Your ID card contains personalized information that identifies you as a PEIA PPB Plan mem - ber and ensures that you receive the correct coverage for your prescription drugs. If you use an Express Scripts network pharmacy, you do not have to file a claim form. The pharmacist will file the claim for you online and will let you know your portion of the cost. If you use a network pharmacy and choose not to have the pharmacist file the claim for you online, you will pay 100% of the prescription price at the time of purchase. All applicable management, such as prior authorization, step therapy, and quantity limits still apply. You may submit the receipt with a completed claim form to Express Scripts for reimbursement. The prescription receipt must be attached to the form. You will usually be reimbursed within 21 days from receipt of your claim form. You will be reimbursed the amount PEIA would have paid, less your required copayment, and your deductible (if applicable). This reimbursement is usually less than you paid for the prescription. If you need claim forms, call Express Scripts Customer Care at 1-855-224-6247 or visit their website at www.express-scripts.com/wvpeia . To find the participating pharmacies nearest you, call Express Scripts Customer Care at 1-855-224-6247 . If you have Internet access, you can find a pharmacy online at www.express-scripts.com/wvpeia . Using the Retail Maintenance Network If you take a drug on a long-term basis, you MUST purchase a 90-day supply of that drug if it is on the maintenance list (see the Maintenance Drug List later in this section) from a Retail Maintenance Network pharmacy. Check with your local pharmacist to verify participation.96 MAINTENANCE DRUG COPAYMENTS PEIA PPB PLAN A or D PEIA PPB Plan Up to 30-day supply90-day supply*Up to 30-day supply90-day supply* Generic medication Not Covered $20 Brand-name medica - tion listed on ListNot Covered $50 Not Covered $60 Brand-name medication not listed on the Covered 75% CoinsuranceNot Covered 75% Coinsurance *For maintenance mediations only. See the Maintenance Medications section for the list of qualifying med - ications. You must purchase all medications on the Maintenance Drug List in 90-day supplies through a Retail Maintenance Network pharmacy or through Mail Service. Read on for details. # Should your doctor prescribe, or you request the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available, you must pay 75% coinsurance. For initial start on a new drug, patient may receive up to 2 30-day fills to be sure the drug is tolerated. After these two initial fills, the drug must be purchased in a 90-day supply to be covered. Using Non-Network Pharmacies If you use a non-participating pharmacy, you will pay 100% of the prescription price at the time of purchase and submit a completed claim form to Express Scripts. The prescription receipt must be attached to the form. You will usually be reimbursed within 21 days from re - ceipt of your claim form. You will be reimbursed the amount PEIA would have paid at a par - ticipating pharmacy, less your required copayment and your deductible (if applicable). This reimbursement is usually less than you paid for the prescription. All applicable management, such as prior authorization, step therapy, and quantity limits still apply. If you purchase a Maintenance Medication at a non-network pharmacy , you will not be re - imbursed for your purchase. Maintenance Medications must be purchased from Retail Maintenance Network pharmacies or using the Express Scripts Mail Service Pharmacy Program. If you need claims forms call Express Scripts Customer Care at 1-855-224-6247 or visit their website at www.express-scripts.com/wvpeia . Using the Express Scripts Mail Service Pharmacy Program Express Scripts provides a convenient mail service pharmacy program for PEIA PPB Plan insureds. You may use the mail service pharmacy if you're taking medication to treat an on - going health condition, such as high blood pressure, asthma, or diabetes. When you use the mail service pharmacy, you must order a 90-day supply of a medication on the maintenance list, as prescribed by your doctor, and pay the member cost share indicated above. You may refill your prescription when 75% of the medication is used up. Express Scripts' licensed professionals fill every prescription following strict quality and safety controls. If you have questions about your prescription, registered pharmacists are available around the clock to consult with you.97 New Prescriptions and the Mail Service Pharmacy If you want to use the mail service pharmacy, the first time you are prescribed a medication that you will need on an ongoing basis, ask your doctor for two prescriptions: the first for a 14-day supply to be filled at a participating retail pharmacy; the second, for a 90-day supply , to be filled through the mail service pharmacy. There are several ways to submit your mail service prescriptions. Just follow the steps below. Some restrictions apply. 1. Ordering new prescriptions. Ask your doctor to prescribe your medication in a 90-day supply for maintenance medications, plus refills if appropriate. Mail your prescription and required copayment along with an order form in the envelope provided. Or ask your doctor to e-prescribe or fax your order to 1-888-327-9791 . You will need to give your doctor your member ID number located on your ID card. 2. Refilling your medication. A few simple precautions will help ensure you don't run out of your prescription. Remember to reorder on or after the refill date indicated on the refill slip. Or reorder when you have less than 14 days of medication left. a) Refills online: Log on or register at Express Scripts' website at www.express-scripts.com/wvpeia.com . Have your member ID number, the prescription number (it's the 9-digit number on your refill slip), and your credit card ready when you log on. b) Refills by phone: Call 1-855-224-6247 and use the automated refill system. Have your member ID number, refill slip with the prescription number, and your credit card ready. c) Refills by mail: Use the refill and order forms provided with your medication. Mail them with your copayment. 3. Delivery of your medication. Prescription orders receive prompt attention and, after processing, are usually sent to you by U.S. mail or UPS within two weeks. Your en - closed medication will include instructions for refills, if applicable. Your package may also include information about the purpose of the medication, correct dosages, and other important details. 4. Paying for your medication. You may pay by check, money order, VISA, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, electronic check, or PayPal. Please note: The phar - macist's judgment and dispensing restrictions, such as quantities allowable, govern certain controlled substances and other prescribed drugs. Federal law prohibits the return of any dispensed prescription medicines. Prior Authorization Your prescription drug program provides coverage for some drugs only if they are prescribed for certain uses and amounts, so those drugs require prior authorization for coverage. Prior Authorization is handled by the Rational Drug Therapy Program (RDT) and Express Scripts depending on the medication. If your medication must be authorized, your pharmacist or physician can initiate the review process for you. The prior authorization process is typically resolved over the phone; if done by letter it can take up to two business days. If your med - ication is not approved for plan coverage, you will have to pay the full cost of the drug. Your pharmacist or physician may contact the Rational Drug Therapy Program. PEIA will cover, and your pharmacist can dispense, up to a five-day supply of a medication requiring prior authorization for the applicable copayment. Your pharmacist or doctor should contact the Rational Drug Therapy Program. This policy applies when your doctor is either unavailable or temporarily unable to complete the prior authorization process promptly. Prior 98 authorizations may be approved retroactively for up to 30 days to allow time for the physician to work with and provide documentation to RDT. If the prior authorization is ultimately ap - proved, your pharmacist will be able to dispense the remainder of the approved amount with no further copayment for that month's supply if you have already paid the full copayment. All prior authorization requests must be reviewed annually. For the most up-to-date clinical management, please refer to the Full Formulary listing found on our website at peia.wv.gov . Once on the website, simply click the Partners tab, select Express Scripts and click on the Prescription Drug Lists link.

The changes will be included in PEIA's Plan Document, which is filed with the Secretary of State's office, and will be incor - porated into the next edition of the Summary Plan Description. Drugs with Special Limitations Step Therapy Step Therapy promotes appropriate utilization of first-line drugs and/or therapeutic catego - ries. Step Therapy requires that participants receive one or more first-line drug(s), as defined by program criteria before prescriptions are covered for second-line drugs in defined cases where a step approach to drug therapy is clinically justified. To promote use of cost-effective, first-line therapy, PEIA uses step therapy in the following therapeutic classes:100 Examples of medications with step therapy are listed below.

Maintenance Network Pharmacy or through Express Scripts mail service. You must receive a 90-day supply of the medications and classes listed below. Maintenance medications dispensed in quantities less than 90 days are not covered by the plan. If you are starting on a new maintenance medication, you may receive up to two 30-day fills to be sure you tolerate the medication and that your dosage is correct. After the second 30-day fill, the maintenance medication will be covered only in a 90-day supply, and only when filled at a Retail Maintenance Network pharmacy or using the Express Scripts Mail Service Pharmacy Program. Specialty Drug Program PEIA's Specialty Drug Program has two components: 1. Specialty Injectable Drugs are administered by injection or infusion, and are managed by UMR through the medical benefit. 2. Common Specialty Medications are self-administered, and are managed by Accredo, an Express Scripts Specialty Pharmacy. Specialty Injectable Drugs are prescription drugs used to treat complex, chronic, or rare medical conditions (e.g., cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, HIV, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and hepatitis). Drugs in this category are typically administered by injection or infusion. Specialty Injectables often require special handling (e.g., refrigeration) and ongoing clinical monitoring. The PEIA PPB Plans cover specialty injectable drugs through a program managed by UMR. The program provides comprehensive direction to policyholders and their dependents for treatments utilizing specialty drugs. If your physician prescribes a specialty drug, that physician, you, or the pharmacist must call UMR at 1-888-440-7342 . The Specialty Injectable Drug list is located at 107 https://www.umrwebapps.com/SpecialtyInjectable/77700000 . To obtain a paper copy, call 1-888-680-7342 . UMR will review the drug for medical necessity. If denied, UMR will contact your physician for additional information which may allow approval of the requested medication. Common Specialty Medications are self-administered specialty injectable drugs purchased through Accredo, an Express Scripts Specialty Pharmacy. Through the Accredo Specialty Pharmacy specialists will check in to see what you need and how they can help moving forward. They'll also make arrangements for injection training, as needed. If your physician prescribes a specialty drug, they can call 1-800-803-2523 , fax 1-888-302-1021 , or e-pre - scribe the specialty drug to Accredo. The Accredo Specialty Pharmacy will then work with your doctor to obtain prior authorization for the specialty medication. Once approved, you can have your specialty medications delivered directly to you. Many specialty medications have manufacturer programs which will financially assist pa - tients in the purchase of the medication. PEIA requires that if a financial assistance program is available, you must participate in the program. Only your actual out-of-pocket payments will count toward your drug deductible and annual out-of-pocket maximum; not amounts discounted off the price by the manufacturer or seller of the specialty medication. Specialty drugs have the following key characteristics: Need frequent dosage adjustments Cause more severe side effects than traditional drugs Need special storage, handling and/or administration Have a narrow therapeutic range Require periodic laboratory or diagnostic testing After you have met your prescription drug deductible, the copayment on these medications will generally be $100 for any Common Specialty Medications on the WV Preferred Drug List and $150 for any Common Specialty Medications not on the WV Preferred Drug List; how - ever, certain specialty medications are subject to variable copayments, depending on the availability of programs. Only your actual out-of-pocket payments will count toward your drug deductible and annual out-of-pocket maximum, not amounts discounted off the price by the manufacturer or seller of the specialty medications. Contact Express Scripts to verify copay - ments. These drugs are not available in 90-day supplies. If you are prescribed one of these common specialty medications, call Express Scripts at 1-855-224-6247 .108 Common Specialty Medications Examples of specialty medications are listed below. This list is not all-inclusive. DRUG NAME NEUROLOGICAL THERAPY All Common Specialty Medications require Precertification from Express Scripts. [QLL] This drug is subject to Quantity Level Limits (QLL). This list is not all-inclusive and is subject to change throughout the Plan Year. *Coverage of this drug is limited to a once-in-a lifetime course of treatment.109 Diabetes Management PEIA covers diabetes management items under its Maintenance Medication benefit, which means that needles, syringes, lancets and test strips must be purchased in 90-day supplies from a Retail Maintenance Network Pharmacy or through Express Scripts mail service. For patients just starting use of needles, syringes, lancets or test strips, PEIA will permit two 30-day fills of the new prescription at a network pharmacy, but after that, all items must be purchased in 90-day supplies from a Retail Maintenance Network Pharmacy or through Express Scripts mail service. Omnipod DASH insulin delivery systems are covered under the Prescription Drug Program at the preferred drug copay of $25 per 30-day supply or $50 per 90-day supply in Plans A and D, or $30 per 30-day supply or $60 per 90-day supply in Plan B. The standard Express Scripts quantity limit (QL) for Omnipod DASH is 10 pods per thirty-day supply or 30 pods per ninety-day supply. Quantities greater than this will require prior authorization from the Rational Drug Therapy Program (RDTP). UMR will no longer precertify Omnipod DASH, but all other Insulin pumps will still require pre-certification through UMR and be covered under the medical benefit. Blood Glucose Monitors: Covered diabetic insureds can receive a free Reflect, FreeStyle Lite, or FreeStyle Freedom Lite blood glucose monitor with a current prescription. All major chain pharmacies and some doctor's offices have vouchers for the OneTouch meters. Take your prescription to them or call the Express Scripts Diabetic Meter Program at 1-855-224-6247 to request a meter. Glucose Test Strips: The plan covers only OneTouch Reflect, OneTouch Verio, FreeStyle Lite, and Freestyle preferred copayment of $50 per 90-day supply for PPB Plans A and D, and $60 per 90-day supply for PPB Plan B. Other brands require a 100% copayment. Needles/Syringes and Lancets: You can obtain a supply of disposable needles/syringes and lancets for the copayments listed below.

Express Scripts uses the health and prescription information about you and your dependents to administer your benefits. They also use information and prescription data from claims sub - mitted nationwide for reporting and analysis without identifying individual patients. When your prescriptions are filled at one of Express Scripts' mail service pharmacies or at a participating retail pharmacy, pharmacists use the health and prescription information on file for you to consider many important clinical factors including drug selection, dosing, interac - tions, duration of therapy and allergies. Express Scripts' pharmacists may also use informa - tion received from your network retail pharmacy. Drug Utilization Review Under the drug utilization review program, prescriptions filled through the mail service phar - macy and participating retail pharmacies are examined by Express Scripts for potential drug interactions based on your personal medication profile. The drug utilization review is espe - cially important if you or your covered dependents take many different medications or see more than one doctor. If there is a question about your prescription, your pharmacist may notify your doctor before dispensing the medication. Education and Safety You will receive information about critical topics like drug interactions and possible side ef - fects with every new prescription Express Scripts mails. Your retail pharmacy may also pro - vide you with drug information. By visiting www.express-scripts.com/wvpeia , you also can access other health-related information. To view health information personalized to fit your interests, register with www.express-scripts.com/wvpeia . Any written health information cannot replace the expertise and advice of health care practitioners who have direct contact with a patient. All Express Scripts health information is designed to help you communicate more effectively with your doctor and, as a result, understand more completely your situation and choices. Health Management Based on your prescription and health information, Express Scripts may provide information to you on one or more of Express Scripts' Care Management programs, provided as a ser - vice to you by PEIA. Program participants generally receive educational mailings and may receive a follow-up call from an Express Scripts pharmacist or nurse. Express Scripts devel - ops these programs to support your doctor's care, and they may contact your doctor regard - ing your participation in these programs. Coordination of Benefits If another insurance carrier is the primary insurer for a policyholder or a dependent, or if you are Medicare-eligible, PEIA will pursue coordination of benefits. 1. Commercial Insurance: As a secondary payor, PEIA will pay only if the other insurance plan's benefit is less than what PEIA would have provided as the primary 113 insurer. If PEIA is the secondary insurer, you must submit the following documenta - tion to Express Scripts to have the secondary claim processed: a completed Express Scripts claim form; the receipt from the pharmacy; and an Explanation of Benefits from the primary plan or a pharmacy printout that shows the amount paid by the primary plan. You will usually be reimbursed within 30 days from receipt of your claim form. If you need claim forms, call Express Scripts' Member services at 1-855-224-6247 or visit their website at www.express-scripts.com/wvpeia . 2. Medicare Part B: If Medicare is the primary insurer, Medicare must be billed first for any drugs covered by Medicare Part B. Your pharmacist should bill Medicare Part B as the primary insurer. UMR will receive the crossover claims from Medicare Part B and pay the pharmacy directly. This will save you money since PEIA will pay the member responsibility for prescription drugs covered by Medicare Part B. You should not pay any deductible or co-insurance for Medicare Part B-covered drugs. You can find a listing of pharmacies willing to bill Medicare and accept assignment on our website at peia.wv.gov or by calling our customer service unit at 1-888-680-7342 . These classes of drugs are usually covered by Medicare Part B: a) Immunosuppressants b) Oral Chemotherapeutic medications c) Drugs for nausea associated with chemo meds d) Diabetic testing supplies e) Limited Inhalation therapies HOW TO FILE A CLAIM Filing a Prescription Drug Claim Prescription drug claims are processed by Express Scripts and should be submitted to: Express Scripts, Attn: Commercial Claims, P.O. Box 14711 Lexington, KY 40512-4711 To process a prescription drug claim, Express Scripts requires a prescription receipt/label which includes: Pharmacy Name/Address Date Filled Drug Name, Strength and NDC Rx Number Quantity Days' Supply Price Patient's Name Claims received missing any of the above information may be returned or payment may be denied or delayed. Cash register receipts and canceled checks are not acceptable proof of your claim. If you have other insurance which is primary, you need to submit an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the other insurance which shows the amount the primary insurance paid with 114 each claim, or ask your provider to do so if the claim is being submitted for you. You have six (6) months from the date of services to file a prescription claim. If PEIA is your secondary in - surer, you have six (6) months from the date of your primary insurer's Explanation of Benefits processing date to file your claim with PEIA. If you do not submit claims within this period, they will not be paid. If your claim is for an illness or injury wrongfully or negligently caused by someone else, and you expect to be reimbursed by another party or insurance plan, you must file a claim with PEIA within six (6) months of the date of service to ensure that the covered services will be paid. Later, if you receive payment for the expenses, you will have to repay the amount you receive from PEIA. See \"Subrogation\" on page 124 for details. Filing Claims for Court-ordered Dependents (COD) If you are the custodial parent of a child who is covered under the other parent's PEIA plan as a result of a court order, you must use your I.D. card at a participating pharmacy to re - ceive prescription benefits. Claims incurred Outside of the U.S.A. If you or a covered dependent incur prescription drug expenses while outside the United States, you will be required to pay the provider yourself. Request an itemized bill containing all the information listed above from your provider and submit the bill along with a claim form to Express Scripts. Express Scripts will determine, through a local banking institution, the currency exchange rate and you will be reimbursed according to the terms of PEIA PPB Plans A, B & D. APPEALING A DRUG CLAIM If you think that an error has been made in processing your prescription drug claim or in a prescription benefit determination or denial, first call Express Scripts or RDT (depending on the nature of your complaint) to ask for details. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your telephone inquiry, the second step is to appeal to Express Scripts or RDT in writing. Please have your physician provide any additional relevant clinical information to support your request. Mail your request with the above information to: TYPE OF ERROR WHO TO CALL WHERE TO WRITE Prior Authorization error or denial (for Physician's offices or pharmacists ONLY)RDT 1-800-847-3859 Rational Drug Therapy Program WVU School of Pharmacy P.O.

If this does not resolve the issue, the third step is to ap - peal in writing to the director of PEIA. Your physician must request a review in writing within sixty (60) days of receiving the decision from Express Scripts or RDT . Mail third step appeals to: Director, Public Employees Insurance Agency, 601 57th St. SE, Charleston, WV 25304-2345. Facts, issues, comments, letters, Explanations of Benefits (EOBs), and all pertinent informa - tion about the claim and review should be included. When your request for review arrives, PEIA will reconsider the entire case, considering any additional materials that have been provided. A decision, in writing, explaining the reason for modifying or upholding the original disposition of the claim will be sent to the covered person or his or her authorized represen - tative. For more information about your drug coverage, please contact Express Scripts at 1-855-224-6247 . External Review: If we have denied your request for the provision of or payment for a health care service or course of treatment, our decision may be reviewed by independent health care professionals who have no association with us if our decision involved making a judgment as to the medical necessity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of care or effectiveness of the health care service or treatment you requested. An external review may be initiated by us or requested by you. You may submit a request for external review within 4 months after receipt of the notice of denial to the PEIA Clinical Unit, 601 57th Street, SE, Suite 2, Charleston, WV 25304-2345. For standard external review by your request, a deci - sion will be made within 45 days of receiving your request. If you have a medical condition that would seriously jeopardize your life or health or would jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function if treatment is delayed, you may request an expedited external review of our denial. If our denial to provide or pay for a health care service or course of treatment is based on a determination that the service or treatment is experimental or investigational, you also may request an external review of our denial. External review is the final level of appeal, regardless of whether the external review was initiated by us or requested by you. External review is not available for drugs, services or items which are simply not covered by the Plan. External review is also not available for out-of-state benefit level appeals or for a change in drug cost-sharing tier.

Visually impaired insureds may request that their mail service prescriptions include labels in Braille by calling 1-855-224-6247 .116 CONTROLLING COSTS Prohibition of Balance Billing All PEIA health plans are governed in part by the Omnibus Health Care Act which was enact - ed by the West Virginia Legislature in April 1989. This Law requires that any West Virginia health care provider who treats a PEIA insured must accept assignment of benefits and can - not balance bill the insured for any portion of charges over and above the PEIA fee allowance or for any discount amount applied to a provider's charge or payment. This is known as the \"prohibition of balance billing.\" The prohibition of balance billing applies when services are provided in West Virginia and when the PEIA PPB plan is the primary payor. When the PEIA PPB plan is the second - ary payor, the provider may bill you for disallowed amounts and for the provider discounts. Remember, you are always responsible for deductibles, copayments, coinsurance amounts and non-covered services. A PEIA insured who has Medicare as the primary payor has protection against balance billing when the provider accepts Medicare assignment. If the provider accepts Medicare assign - ment, you are not responsible for amounts which exceed the Medicare allowances. New Technologies Upon FDA approval of new technology, PEIA determines whether to cover the item, service or procedure. These new technologies may or may not be covered. PEIA often waits until the new technology proves effective before approving coverage. If you have concerns about coverage of a new technology, contact UMR for details. Preferred Provider Organizations For services provided outside the State of West Virginia, UMR utilizes several networks. These networks review their providers for quality standards like licensing, background and treatment patterns. As part of their agreement with the network, the amount paid for services is a discounted amount. For details of which networks UMR uses, see \"PEIA 's Networks\" on page 47. After you receive medical attention, your claim will be routed to UMR. All PPO providers are paid directly, relieving you of any hassle and worry. You will need to pay for out-of-pocket expenses (deductibles, copayments, coinsurance amounts and non-covered services). UMR will send you an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). Out-of-State Provider Waiver (PEIA PPB Plans A & B ONLY) To assist participants in PEIA PPB Plans A & B who receive medical treatment outside of West Virginia from providers who do not participate in the UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus PPO, guidelines have been established to review and approve waiver requests when you are billed for the balance not paid by PEIA and not applied to your OOSINNA deductible and out-of-pocket maximum. The first $500 of expenses which exceed the allowed amount will be your responsibility. Amounts in excess of $500 may be eligible for an out-of-state provider waiver when: 1. the PEIA PPB Plan is the primary payor for the services provided; and 2. you are billed for amounts which exceed the fee allowance; and 3. you must receive out-of-state services because: a) an emergency arises; or b) the insured lives or is traveling out-of-state; c) the medically-necessary service is not available in West Virginia (or within a reasonable travel time); or117 d) due to geographic location, PEIA has determined that services are only available out-of- state; and 4. you do not have other insurance which will pay toward the balance. Expenses eligible for waivers are those which exceed the maximum fee allowances. Amounts applied toward your OOSINNA deductible, your out-of-network coinsurance amount, penalties, and non-covered services will not be considered for a waiver . To request a waiver, send your balance bill from the provider, a copy of your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) indicating the amount already paid by PEIA, and a written request including the rea - son you chose an out-of-state provider to: Director, Public Employees Insurance Agency, 601 57th St. SE, Charleston, WV 25304-2345. You may obtain a PEIA Out-of-State Waiver Form from our website at peia.wv.gov or by calling PEIA at 1-304-558-7850 or toll-free at 1-888-680-7342 . A waiver form is not required if you send the above-requested information. The request for an Out-of-State Waiver must be submitted within six months of the processing date on the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) to be eligible for additional payments. The Out-of-State Waiver program is NOT available for members of PEIA PPB Plans C or D. The program is also not available for air ambulance fees. PPB Plan C is an IRS-qualified, High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). For more informa - tion about Plan C, download the Summary Plan Description (Plan C) at peia.wv.gov or call 1-888-680-7342 . Patient Audit Program The Patient Audit Program offers rewards when you help detect and correct mistakes on your health care bills. Examine your medical bills for these two types of mistakes: 1. charges for services not received; and 2. overcharges or overpayments resulting from clerical error or miscalculation. 3. Any claim for a condition not present on admission, such as a hospital acquired infection or fall. Reported errors must be at least $50.00 to qualify for the Patient Audit Program and must be submitted within 60 days of the processing date on the Explanation of Benefits (EOB). Complete the Patient Audit Report Form from PEIA and submit it, along with an itemized bill from the provider, the corrected bill (or explanation of disagreement), and a copy of the EOB, to PEIA. PEIA and UMR or Express Scripts will investigate and recover the overpayment, if justified, from the provider of services. When the overpayment is processed you will be paid 50% of the recovered amount, up to $1,000 per plan year. HMO members are not eligible to participate in the Patient Audit Program Healthcare Fraud and Abuse By law, PEIA must report suspected fraud to the WV Insurance Commission. In addition, PEIA works with the US Attorney's office in the investigation of potential fraud and/or abuse. Examples of Provider Fraud: waiving member copays; balance billing members for services; billing for services not provided; billing for a non-covered service as a covered service (e.g. billing a \"tummy tuck\" (non-covered) as a hernia repair (covered);118 billing that appears to be a deliberate claim for duplicate payments for the same services; misrepresenting dates, services or identities of members or providers; intentional incorrect reporting of diagnoses or procedures to maximize payment (up-coding); billing for separate parts of a procedure rather than the whole (unbundling); accepting or giving kickbacks for member referrals; prescribing additional and unnecessary treatments (over-utilization). Examples of Member Fraud: providing false information when applying for PEIA coverage; forgoing or selling prescription drugs; \"loaning\" or using another's insurance card. How to Report Healthcare Fraud and Abuse If you suspect healthcare fraud, please call the PEIA toll-free number ( 1-888-680-7342 ) and ask to speak with a member of the Special Investigations Team or complete the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Form on PEIA's website. You will be asked to provide as much information as possible. PEIA will investigate your concern(s) and, if appropriate, refer the information to the appropriate legal authorities. Administrative Hearing Procedures Pursuant to W. Va. Code \u00a7\u00a75-16-12 or 5-16-12a, PEIA may hold administrative hearings to make determinations in order to recover improperly-paid funds or withhold and setoff any payment of benefits or other payment due until any improper payment is recovered. PEIA 's administrative hearing procedures may be found in PEIA's Plan Document, which is filed with the Secretary of State's office. Coordination of Benefits In its effort to control health care costs, the PEIA PPB Plan has a coordination of benefits (COB) provision. Under this provision, when a person covered by PEIA also has coverage under another policy (or policies), there are certain rules determining which policy is required to pay benefits first. The policy paying first is called the primary plan, and any other applica - ble policy is called the secondary plan. UMR, on PEIA's behalf, will request information about other coverage using a questionnaire mailed to the policyholder periodically. If the policyholder fails to respond to the question - naire, claims will be denied until the information is received. If you have health insurance coverage in addition to the PEIA PPB Plan, it is important to understand how the coordination of benefits provision works. In many instances, if the PEIA PPB Plan is secondary, PEIA will pay little or nothing of the balance of your medical bill. An example of this situation is provid - ed on the next page. In some cases, it may be financially advisable to elect only one insur - ance coverage. If, after reviewing this section, you have questions concerning how PEIA 's coordination of benefits provision may affect you, contact a PEIA claims representative at 1-304-558-7850 or toll-free at 1-888-680-7342 . Coordinating PEIA Benefits with Other Plans COB will occur when an employee, retired employee or dependent has health coverage un - der the PEIA PPB Plan and also under: 1. any government program or other coverage required or provided by law; 2. any plan covering individuals as a group, including insured, uninsured and pre-payment arrangements; 3. automobile insurance medical pay provisions whether individual or group. PEIA will pay as primary plan and subrogate against the medical payment coverage; 4. group-type hospital indemnity benefits exceeding $100 per day;119 5. for spouses and dependents only, individual hospital and surgical or major medical insur - ance in which that spouse or dependent is the policyholder. Individual and surgical or ma - jor medical insurance does not include any individual supplemental accident and sickness policy which meets the definition of a limited benefits policy or certificate under W .Va. Code \u00a73-16E-2(a). These individual policies must meet all of the following conditions: a) the policy covers a specified disease, accident only, disability, or other limited benefits; b) the policy is specifically designed, represented and sold as a supplement to other basic sickness and accident coverage; and c) the entire premium for the policy is paid by the insured or insured's family. Which Plan Pays First For active employees, the PEIA PPB Plan is your primary plan in almost every circumstance. If your spouse is covered through his or her employer, that plan is usually the primary plan for your spouse. The primary plan is determined by the first of the following rules which applies: A. any plan with no coordination of benefits provision is always primary; B. the plan which covers the person as an active or retired employee, member or subscriber (other than as a dependent) is always primary to a plan which covers the person as a de - pendent. When two public employees, both eligible to enroll for PEIA coverage in their own names, are married and covered under one PEIA family plan, then the spouse, covered as a dependent, will be treated as an employee under these rules; C. for an active employee's dependent who has coverage as a retired employee from his or her former employer and is also covered by Medicare, benefits are determined in this order: 1) the plan which covers the individual as a dependent of an active employee will pay first; 2) Medicare will pay next; 3) the plan which covers the person as a retired employee will pay last. D. for a dependent child of parents not separated or divorced, if two or more plans cover the child as a dependent: 1) the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the year will be primary; or 2) if both parents have the same birthday, the plan which has covered one parent longer will be primary; or 3) if the other plan uses the parent's gender to determine benefits, and the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, then the rule of the other plan will determine the order of benefits. E. for a dependent child of parents who are separated or divorced, if two or more plans cover the child as a dependent, benefits are determined in this order: 1) the plan of the parent who has custody will pay first; 2) the plan of the spouse of the parent who has custody will pay next; 3) the plan of the parent who does not have custody will pay last. Exception: If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the plan of that parent has knowledge of those terms, then that plan is primary. The plan of the other parent will then be secondary, and the plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child will pay third. For PEIA to pay according to this paragraph, you need to provide a copy of the court decree. F. for a dependent child of divorced parents with joint custody, if the court decree does not specify which parent is responsible for health care coverage, then Rule \"D\" Above will apply; G. for a dependent child of separated parents with joint custody, if the court decree does not specify which parent is responsible for health care coverage, then Rule \"D\" above will apply; H. for a dependent child who has coverage under either or both parents' plans and also has coverage as a dependent under a spouse's plan, the Plan which has covered the dependent the longest will be primary; I. in the event the dependent child's coverage under the spouse's plan began on the same date as the dependent child's coverage under the parent's plans, the order of benefits shall be determined by applying the birthday rule to the dependent child's parent and the dependent's spouse;120 J. a plan which covers an employee (and, consequently, his or her dependents) as an active employee, rather than as a laid-off employee or retired employee, will pay before a plan which covers a laid-off or retired employee. If the other plan does not have this rule, and the plans disagree about the order of benefits, this paragraph is disregarded; K. if a person is covered under a right of continuation policy as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1987, as amended, and is also covered under an - other plan, the following rules will apply: 1) the benefits of a plan covering the person as an employee, member or subscriber (or as the person's dependent) will be primary; 2) the benefits under the continuation coverage will be secondary; L. if none of the above rules, applies, the plan which has covered the employee, member or subscriber the longest will be primary. How Coordination of Benefits Works When a claim is made, the primary plan pays its benefits without regard to any other plans. Then the secondary plan pays its benefits, adjusting for the benefit paid by the primary plan. The amount that the PEIA PPB Plan will pay as a secondary plan depends on what the pri - mary plan pays. To calculate the amount PEIA will pay as a secondary plan, you subtract the amount your primary plan pays from the amount PEIA would have paid if there were no other insurance. If the other plan paid as much or more than PEIA would have paid as the primary plan, then PEIA will pay nothing as the secondary plan. If the other plan paid less than PEIA, then PEIA will pay the difference up to what it would have paid if there had been no other insurance. As you can see in the following chart, the PEIA PPB Plan will pay very little or nothing as a secondary plan. For this reason, you should consider whether it makes sense to keep both plans. \"CARVE -OUT\" COORDINATION OF BENEFITS EXAMPLE If PEIA is primary: If PEIA is secondary: Total Charge Charge $24 *Assumes any deductible has been met. There are several issues to consider if you are thinking about dropping one of your plans: Prescription Drug Coverage: PEIA's coverage is generous. Compare the benefits of both plans, including deductibles. Mental Health Benefits: Many plans pay only 50% or limit the number of admissions per lifetime. The PEIA PPB Plan pays mental health benefits with the same cost-sharing as other medical benefits with no limit when services are pre-certified. Maternity Services: PEIA pays 100% of the physician's allowed charges, after the deductible is met. Balance Billing Prohibition: PEIA protects you from network providers billing you for amounts which exceed PEIA's allowed amounts, but only if the PEIA PPB plan is the primary payor. In the above example, with the PEIA plan as your primary plan, you would not be responsible for the difference between the total charge and the amount allowed by PEIA. The balance billing provi - sion does not apply when the PEIA PPB plan is the secondary plan or when the provider is not in the PEIA PPB plan network. If the primary plan denies payment and the PEIA PPB plan is the secondary insurer, then PEIA becomes the primary plan, if the services are covered by PEIA. If you have questions about your coverage, or need help comparing plans, you may call the PEIA Customer Service Unit at 1-304-558-7850 or toll-free 1-888-680-7342 .121 MEDICARE For most retirees and their Medicare-eligible dependents covered by PEIA and Medicare, regardless of age (see exception below), PEIA's Medicare Advantage plan is the primary insurer. When you become an eligible beneficiary of Medicare, you must enroll in Medicare Parts A and B and send a copy of your Medicare card to PEIA. Part A is an entitlement program and is available without payment of a premium to most individuals. Part B is the supplementary medical insurance program that covers physician services, outpatient laboratory and x-rays tests, durable medical equipment and outpatient hospital care. Part B requires payment of a monthly premium. You MUST NOT enroll in a separate Medicare Part D plan, since PEIA will provide prescription drug coverage for retirees with Medicare. If you do not enroll in Medicare Parts A & B, your coverage may be terminated. If you or your dependents have other coverage in addition to PEIA and Medicare, contact UMR or PEIA to determine what coverage will be primary, secondary or tertiary (third) and whether you need to enroll in Medicare Part B. Exception: If you are entitled to Medicare as an End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) benefi - ciary, call UMR or PEIA to determine who the primary insurer will be. Whenever you or your covered dependents become eligible for Medicare, you should send a copy of your Medicare card to PEIA. Members enrolled in an HMO when they become Medicare-eligible will be transferred to the Special Medicare Plan. Special Medicare Plan PEIA created the Special Medicare plan to accommodate the needs of two specific group of Medicare-eligible members: 1. Members who are unable to access medical care through the PEIA's Medicare Advantage Plan due to provider limitations are permitted, on a case-by-case basis, to move into PEIA's Special Medicare Plan. 2. Employees who retire after the beginning of a plan year, and retired employees who become eligible for Medicare during the Plan year. Retired members who are en - rolled in an HMO when they become Medicare-eligible will be transferred to PEIA 's Special Medicare Plan. These members in the Special Medicare Plan will be moved to PEIA's Medicare Advantage Plan at the beginning of the next plan year (the follow - ing January). Most members are enrolled in the Special Medicare Plan for less than a year . Those who become eligible for Medicare in the middle of a plan year, move into the Special Medicare Plan, and are transferred to the PEIA Medicare Advantage Plan at the beginning of the next Medicare plan year. Under the Special Medicare plan, the member purchases traditional Medicare Parts A and B, and their secondary medical and prescription claims are paid by UMR and Express Scripts, respectively. Medical and Prescription Drug benefits under the Special Medicare Plan are generally the same as those provided under the PEIA's Medicare Advantage plan.122 The Medicare retiree's plan year is from January 1 to December 31 of each year. Below are the benefits for Plan Year 2022: SERVICE DESCRIPTION MEDICARE RETIREE BENEFIT PLAN YEAR 2022 JANUARY - DECEMBER 2022 Annual Deductible $150 Primary Care Office Visit $20 Specialty Office Visit $40 Emergency Room $50 Hospital Inpatient care $100 per admission Outpatient and Office Surgery $100 Other services (testing, etc.) $0 Medical Out-of-Pocket Maximum $1,200 Prescription Drug Deductible $75 Generic $1,750 The benefits described in the \"What is Covered\" section beginning on page 66 will be pro - vided to members of the Special Medicare plan with no deductible and no coinsurance, but with the copayments and out-of-pocket maximum detailed in the chart above. There are two main differences between the Special Medicare Plan and the Humana Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug (MAPD) plan. 1. The non-preferred drug costs - in the Special Medicare Plan, the non-preferred drug cost-sharing is 75% coinsurance; in the MAPD plan, the non-preferred drug coinsur - ance is 50%. 2. The MAPD plan offers a free gym membership through a program called SilverSneakers. SilverSneakers is not available in the Special Medicare Plan. Those who become eligible for the Special Medicare plan during a plan year have the right to request immediate enrollment in the Humana plan. Call PEIA for details. If you have questions about the benefits of the Special Medicare plan, please contact PEIA 's customer service unit at 1-888-680-7342 . 123 Medicare for Active Employees For PEIA PPB Plan active employees and their dependents that are age 65 or older and eli - gible for Medicare, as long as you are an active employee, PEIA will be your primary insurer, except in a few rare cases. As long as you are an active employee, you and your Medicare- eligible dependents do not need to sign up for Medicare Part B and pay the premium. When you prepare to retire, you and any Medicare-eligible dependents must enroll for Medicare Part B. If you do not enroll in Medicare Parts A & B, your coverage may be terminated. You DO NOT need to enroll in Medicare Part D as an active employee or upon retirement. For PEIA PPB Plan active employees who are also eligible for Medicare, and Medicare is the primary payor, PEIA will use the traditional method of coordinating benefits. If you become eligible for Medicare prior to age 65, you must send a copy of your Medicare card to PEIA. This notification may allow PEIA to reduce your premiums and will make the claims payment process go much more smoothly. Benefit Assistance Program Medicare-eligible retired employees with 15 or more years of service whose annual house - hold income falls below 250% of the federal poverty level, and who are members of the PEIA PPB Plan can qualify for benefit assistance. Retired employees who are using sick or annual leave or years of service to extend their employer-paid insurance qualify for this program if their annual income meets the guidelines. The details of the Benefit Assistance Program are described in the Evidence of Coverage produced by Coventry. Since Benefit Assistance is not available to non-Medicare retirees, there is no further discussion of it here. If you are interested in the details of the program, you can find more information online at peia.wv.gov . If you qualify, contact PEIA for an application, or you can print a copy at peia.wv.gov . Medicare Part D Medicare offers prescription drug coverage through Medicare Part D. Please be aware that you DO NOT have to purchase Medicare Part D coverage . PEIA's Medicare Advantage Plan: Humana provides prescription drug coverage for retir - ees in the Medicare Advantage Plan through a Medicare Part D plan. Special Medicare Plan: PEIA continues to provide creditable prescription drug coverage to our members in the Special Medicare Plan, and Medicare Part D will be of little or no use to you. If you enroll in a Medicare Part D plan, PEIA will reject your prescription at the pharma - cy, and require the pharmacy to bill the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan first. For those \"dual eligible\" that have both Medicare and Medicaid, you will be automatically enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan. Using the Medicare Part D plan will be to your benefit, since it is a better benefit to the \"dual eligible\" member. Medicare Part D Creditable Coverage Notice The coverage you have now through West Virginia PEIA is considered by Medicare to be creditable coverage, or coverage as good as or better than that offered under Medicare' s standard Part D benefit. if you are eligible for Medicare and decide to opt out of this plan' s coverage, you should consider joining another plan as soon as possible to avoid having to 124 pay a late enrollment penalty. If you choose to leave this plan and do not join another plan within 63 days of the termination date of this coverage, you will be charged a late enrollment penalty of at least 1% per month you went without coverage as good as or better than that offered under Medicare Part D. When can you change to a different plan? Generally, Medicare-eligible members can change plans during the yearly enrollment period (called the \"annual coordinated election period\"). Generally, this is the only time of year to choose a different Medicare plan. Certain individuals, such as those with Medicaid, those who get \"Extra Help\" paying for their drugs, or those who move out of the geographic service area, can make changes at other times. RECOVERY OF INCORRECT PAYMENTS If PEIA discovers that a claim has been paid incorrectly, or that the charges were excessive or for non-covered services, PEIA has the right to recover its payments from any person or any entity. You must cooperate fully with the PEIA to help it recover any such payment. The PEIA may request refunds or deduct overpayments from a provider's check in order to recover incorrect payments. This provision shall not limit any other remedy provided by law. Subrogation and Reimbursement PEIA may pay medical expenses on an insured's behalf in those situations where an injury, sickness, disease or disability, is caused in whole or in part by, or results from, the acts or omissions of a third party, or from the acts or omissions of a PEIA insured where other insur - ance (such as auto or homeowners) is available. As a condition of receiving such expenses, the PEIA and its agents have the right to recover the cost of such medical expenses from the responsible party directly (whether an unrelated third party or another covered insured) or from their insured, if they have already been reimbursed by another. This right is known as subrogation. The PEIA is legally subrogated to its insured as against the legally responsible party, but only to the extent of the medical expenses paid on the insured's behalf by the PEIA attributable to such sickness, injury, disease, or disability. PEIA has the right to seek repayment of expens - es from, among others, the party that caused the illness or injury , his or her liability carrier or the PEIA insured's own auto insurance carrier in cases of uninsured, underinsured motorist coverage, or medical pay provisions. Subrogation applies, but it is not limited to, the follow - ing circumstances: 1. payments made directly by the person who is liable for a PEIA insured's sickness, injury, disease or disability, or any insurance company which pays on behalf of that person, or any other payments on his or her behalf; 2. any payments, settlements, judgments, or arbitration awards paid by any insurance company under an uninsured, underinsured motorist policy or medical pay provisions on the insured's behalf; and 3. any payments from any source designed or intended to compensate a PEIA insured for sickness, injury, disease, or disability sustained as the result of the negligence or wrongful action or alleged negligence or wrongful action of another person.125 Your Responsibilities: It is the obligation of the PEIA insured to: 1. notify the PEIA in writing of any injury, sickness, disease or disability for which the PEIA has paid medical expenses on behalf of a PEIA insured that may be attributable to the wrongful or negligent acts of another person; 2. notify the PEIA in writing if the insured retains services of an attorney, and of any demand made or lawsuit filed on behalf of a PEIA insured, and of any offer, proposed settlement, accepted settlement, judgment, or arbitration award; 3. provide the PEIA or its agents with information it requests concerning circumstances that may involve subrogation, provide any reasonable assistance requested in assim - ilating such information and cooperate with the PEIA or its agents in defining, verify - ing or protecting its rights of subrogation and reimbursement; and 4. promptly reimburse the PEIA for benefits paid on behalf of a PEIA insured attributable to the sickness, injury, disease, or disability, once they have obtained money through settlement, judgment, award, or other payment. Non-Compliance Failure to comply with any of these requirements may result in: 1. the PEIA's withholding payment of further benefits; and 2. an obligation by the PEIA insured to pay costs, attorney's fees and other expenses incurred by the PEIA in obtaining the required information or reimbursement. By acceptance of benefits paid under the plan, the PEIA insured agrees that PEIA's rights of subrogation and reimbursement shall have a priority lien and the right of first recovery against any settlement or judgment obtained by or on behalf of an insured. This right shall exist without regard to allocation or designation of the recovery. These provisions shall not limit any other remedy provided by law. This right of subrogation shall apply without regard to the location of the event that led to or causes the applicable sickness, injury, disease or disability. Please note: As with any claim, the claims resulting from an accident or other incident which may involve subrogation should be submitted within the PEIA's timely filing requirement of six (6) months. It is not necessary that any settlement, judgment, award, or other payment from a third party have been reached or received before filing a claim with PEIA or with one of the managed care plans associated with PEIA.

However, these employ - ers are permitted to elect to exempt a plan from the requirements listed below for any part of the plan that is \"self-funded\" by the employer, rather than provided through a health insurance policy. PEIA has elected to exempt the PEIA PPB Plans from item two of the following requirements: 1. Protection against limiting hospital stays in connection with the birth of a child to less than 48 hours for a vaginal delivery, and 96 hours for a cesarean section. 2. Protections against having benefits for mental health and substance-use disorders be subject to more restrictions than apply to medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan. 3. Certain requirements to provide benefits for breast reconstruction after a mastectomy . 4. Continued coverage for up to one year for a dependent child who is covered as a dependent under the plan solely based on student status, who takes a medically necessary leave of ab - sence from a postsecondary educational institution. The exemption from these federal requirements will be in effect for the 2023 plan year , beginning July 1, 2022 and ending June 30, 2023. The election may be renewed for subsequent plan years.
