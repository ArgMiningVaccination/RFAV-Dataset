The reasons and methods used for contacting spirits have differed. Depending on region and culture, some contact spirits through rituals, offering sacrifices, seances, or even ouija boards. People and cultures also have different motives for contacting spirits, such as gaining wisdom, seeking prosperity, or contacting ancestors. Ancient accounts of spirit contact can be found in the Bible, including appearances from Saul, Samuel, Moses, and Elijah. During the Middle Ages, mediums assisted with human possessions by the devil. During the witch trials of the early modern period, spirits were said to have given witches knowledge and assistance during their appearances. Modern Spiritualism can be traced back to 1848, when a family living in a farmhouse in Hydesville, NY, experienced several supernatural events and contacted the spirit that was causing them. The family's youngest daughter, Kate Fox, communicated with the spirit, a man murdered in the house, and thus ended the disturbances. After this event, communications with spirits spread rapidly. Spiritualism peaked in Europe in the 1860s and America from the 1840s to the 1920s. Spiritualism has met fierce opposition from the Catholic Church, scientists, and philosophers. Despite this, it is still evolving and gaining followers. Types of Spiritualism As with other movements, Spiritualism grew from when it was founded. Spiritualism has different branches, including traditional, modern, and progressive. Traditional Spiritualism regards how one's awareness continues after death and that these spirits can be communicated with and contacted. Mediums used to display grand gestures of physical manifestations of spirits, whereas now, such intense proof of contact is not as widely practiced or necessary. Modern Spiritualism focuses more on verbal messages and spiritual contact. Modern Spiritualism revolves around spirit healing and gatherings. Gatherings and seances grew to create the Spiritualist Church, also known as the Church of Spiritualism. The Spiritualist Church considers itself a religion and way of life. It proclaims it does not go against the teachings of the Bible and seeks to find truth and healing. Progressive Spiritualism is still evolving in how it communicates with and learns from spirits. The Church of Spiritualism is still growing and obtaining more followers. A seance held by the medium Eusapia Palladino.
