Process technology and equipment with proven efficiency and low project cost Gasification converts fossil or biomass based hydrocarbons into syngas for making various downstream derivatives. Generating a cleaner future by supporting clean energy, low carbon and renewable hydrogen applications in heavy duty transportation, marine, and power industries. HYDROGEN MEGAPROJECTS SUPPORTING ENERGY TRANSITION Clean energy complex in Eastern Louisiana expected to be onstream in 2026. Net-zero hydrogen energy complex in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, expected to come on-stream in 2024. World's first and North America's only commercial-scale sustainable aviation fuel production facility in southern California expected to be onstream in 2025. World's Largest Carbon-free Hydrogen Project An equal production joint venture of ACWA Power, Air Products and NEOM incorporated in August 2021, NEOM Green Hydrogen Company (NGHC) is establishing the world's largest green-hydrogen-based ammonia production facility run on renewable energy. This mega-plant will produce up to 600 tonnes of carbon-free hydrogen per day in the form of green-ammonia as a cost-effective solution for transportation globally. Air Products is the primary EPC contractor and will be the exclusive off-taker of the green ammonia and intends to transport it around the world to be dissociated to produce green hydrogen for the transportation market. World's Largest Industrial Gas Complex in Jazan The JV's purchase of this second group of assets at Jazan follows the successful asset acquisition and project financing transactions for the first group of assets completed in late October 2021. The JV owns and operates the facility under a 25-year contract for a fixed monthly fee, with Aramco supplying feedstock to the JV, and the JV producing power, steam, hydrogen and other utilities for Aramco.
