Used for thousands of years in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine and renowned throughout ancient Persia and Greece, Saffron is a spice worth noting in our modern world. Saffron is the three red stigmas of the Crocus Sativus flower, collected by hand, dried, and crushed to make the world's most coveted spice. Saffron, a rare spice due to its annual harvest of only 8 days and labor intensity, comes with a hefty price tag. However, this ancient spice is packed with tons of antioxidants and nutrients that are notable for boosting mood, enhancing cognition, and detoxifying the body. Saffron's story is as old as time and has been treasured throughout the ages in traditional medicine. Follow on to peer deeper into Saffron's mysterious roots and ability to optimize health.

In a clinical study, Saffron [was found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15707766) (1) to be just as effective as the commonly prescribed SSRI, fluoxetine, supporting saffron's antidepressant capabilities. - Supports detoxification Saffron is a natural source of the antioxidant glutathione, which plays a role in [helping](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4923465/) (2) your body to detox through supporting your liver - your body's main detox organ. In addition, [glutathione](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2d92/79b5c3f138dbe302e450943a709c54c84662.pdf) (3) leads to cell regeneration and a healthy gut. - Lowers inflammation Saffron has powerful anti-inflammatory abilities due to its high antioxidant, crocetin, and crocin content that [work to fight](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22934747) (4) pro-inflammatory cytokines. - Enhances cognitive function Not only can saffron intake help [improve](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11062-014-9436-3) (5) short-term memory, saffron has been shown to help improve the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to the [same extent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19838862) (6) as the commonly prescribed Alzheimer's drugs, donepezil, and [imipramine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20831681) (7) but without the adverse side effects. - Promotes skin health Two well-known skin-enhancing nutrients vitamin C and glutathione are abundant in saffron which work to fight free-radical damage to cells that contribute to dull skin and wrinkles. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15387720) (8) even showed that daily intake of saffron can improve mild to moderate psoriasis. Our largest organ, our skin, has a unique relationship with the internal detoxification of the liver, one that can be solved with glutathione optimization. - Reduces heart disease risk Cholesterol has often been an indicator of heart disease risk. While sometimes that can be an over-simplistic view of heart disease, saffron has been shown to [inhibit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3466873/) (9) the rise of both triglyceride and total LDL numbers, both of which are markers for increased risk of heart disease. In locations where saffron is a diet staple, such as Spain, reports showed overall lower rates of cardiovascular disease. - Aids digestion Because saffron can promote blood flow to the digestive system it can help ease symptoms of digestive distress. It also coats the gut to help soothe and calm damage and inflammation, which can be particularly useful in the cases of leaky gut syndrome. - Reduces cravings Consumption of saffron [has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20579522) (10) in studies to help you feel fuller for longer and more satiated to therefore reduce cravings and unnecessary snacking. - Hormonal health Saffron has been found to be an effective treatment for [PMS symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18271889) (11) with more relief experienced over time with each new cycle. - Assists weight loss Weight loss was shown to be a byproduct of increased satiety and reduced snacking from saffron intake. Saffron has also been shown to promote [overall weight loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4665515/) (12) through its antioxidative properties and anti-inflammatory abilities. Is it safe to take saffron daily? If you have noticed any signs or symptoms of hormone imbalance, skin problems, poor digestion, low moods, or stubborn weight, you might have a lot to gain from these saffron benefits. You may choose to take saffron supplements or incorporate saffron into your meals twice a day until you see improvements. Keep in mind that it is always important to consult a medical professional when incorporating any kind of supplementation to reduce risk to your unique health needs. How to get more saffron benefits from your diet While saffron is a great spice to cook with, and there are several incredible saffron benefits that come from supplementation, as well as saffron extract benefits, one of my absolute favorite ways to incorporate it into my life is through SAFFORIA Elixirs. SAFFORIA allows me to get a medicinal amount of saffron with each 4 oz. bottle to really harness the health benefits of this powerful spice. SAFFORIA also combines the power of saffron with other superfoods like black pepper, ginger, and passionfruit to make it more bioavailable and elevate its already amazing health benefits.

Saffron has very few risks or side effects and is considered generally safe, though there are some who should consider more carefully its use. As for most treatments, those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid the use of saffron or consult a medical professional first. Those who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder or blood pressure conditions - or are otherwise taking blood pressure medication or blood thinners - should also practice caution as it can have negative interactions.
