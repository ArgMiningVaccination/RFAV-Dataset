These not only come from food, but include oxygen and water, movement, stimulation, love and touch, and perhaps music, spirituality, and justice. Anti-nutrients ( ANs ) prevent growth and healing, and come in food and non-food varieties. This article will foc us on nutritional ANs. Nutritional ANs can block the absorption of nu trients and/or act as toxins, exerting a negative effect on our bo dy. Public awareness of certain ANs is increasing. Glu ten, a protein found in most grains, is an AN protein that can wreak subtle or huge havoc on multiple systems of the bod y, even without celiac disease. Pesticides and genetically modified foods can in many ways be considered ANs, since their tox ic effects essentially alter our hormonal and other biochemica l processes. Alcohol, made by yeast, is in some ways an AN due t o it's effect on the liver and brain; however, for most of us, th e effects are short-lasting and have some pleasurable aspects. The purpose of ANs is relatively simple: plants ne eded to protect their seeds from consumption and destructio n by other organisms. So the ANs evolved as poisons making the ingestor sick, or block the digestion of the seeds so they a re excreted undamaged, in which case the animal has helped spre ad the seeds! Many ANs are in contained in grains, legumes (incl uding soy) and white potatoes. Some of these foods can kill us if eaten raw. We must use heat to destroy some or all of these ANs in the foods. Other methods of de-activating ANs include fermenting, sprouting and soaking. Individual ability to tolerate and digest these ANs is based on a host of factors including genetics, dose, other toxins, age, digestion and other factors. Craving Toxic Foods If bit by a lion, we need to keep running. In response to trauma, the body produces hormones like adrenaline and morphine-like molecules to enable us to escape and survive. By similar mechanisms, we get high by eating bad food! Many ANs such as casein protein from dairy and glu ten from wheat (even without celiac disease), by virtue of t heir toxicity, can activate pleasure circuits in our brain. Morphine-l ike molecules are created, which, like heroin, can cause short-te rm pleasure at the risk of long-term dysfunction. Many of us becom e addicted to such foods (bread, cheese, ice cream). Analyzing Foods This new information places past nutritional analy sis and value of many \"healthy\" foods in question. For exam ple, while whole grains, when analyzed in a lab, can demonstra te a high level of zinc, in real life the zinc can be bound to a co mpound called phytate, which renders it inabsorbable. We know the re is a prev- alence of zinc deficiency\u2014partly due to the misconc eption that grains will provide all our dietary zinc. Soy can b lock absorption of iodine, necessary for thyroid, breasts and young brains. Many ANs such saponins in white potatoes are minim ally altered by heat, and then cause an inflammatory rea ction in the small intestines, where the majority of nutrient ab sorption occurs. This inflammatory reaction not only blocks absorpti on, it can cause \"leaky gut\", which then allows other toxic mo lecules to breach the intestinal barrier and enter our bloodst ream. For example, wheat germ agglutinin and peanut lectins a re found in the blood unchanged after eating and can promote cl otting of blood. Through such mechanisms, there can be a \"per fect storm\" of toxic effects causing a spiraling down of health after a single or multiple exposures to a specific food or combinatio n of foods (pizza?) at any point in life. Such effects have n ot yet been fully studied. Vegetarianism and ANs If indeed, grains and legumes are toxic, then what about vegetarianism? What about all the societies whose staples are rice, beans, corn and potatoes? There seems to be s ignificant variability between individuals. Traditional method s of preparation, such as soaking, fermentation and spro uting may be essential. Depending upon several factors including how often it is eaten, in what combinations, and genetics, certain AN foods (such as soy) can be tolerated and even nutritious. In ge neral, greens, nuts and seeds are considered safe. Evaluation and Protection from ANs Intolerance to certain foods can be obvious or com pletely obscure. Use of probiotics, enzymes, acid, and othe r gut-healing compounds, and specific preparation methods can eve ntually enable the re-addition of previously toxic foods on a rotational basis. The avoidance of certain foods for periods o f time may be necessary to enable healing (elimination diets). A know- ledgeable practitioner can help with the design of an exploratory process and optimal food plan.
