Things to consider Don't take any herbal health products or supplements without talking to your family doctor first. This is especially the case if you take any other prescription or over-the-counter medicine. If you do use an herbal health product or supplement, read the directions on the label to learn how much to take and how often to take it. You should never take more than the recommended amount. If you have any questions about how much to take, ask your doctor. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and the Office of Dietary Supplements are good sources of information about herbal health products and supplements. Questions to ask your doctor - Is it safe for me to take _________ supplement? - What interactions might the supplement cause with medicines I am taking? - Is there a different medicine I can take that won't cause interactions? - There are so many supplements available at the store. How do I pick the right one for me? Copyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians This information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.
