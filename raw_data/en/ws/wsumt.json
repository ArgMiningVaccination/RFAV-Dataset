Acupuncture has been widely used throughout the world for a number of conditions including pain, digestive disorders, nervous system disorders, stress management, endocrine disorders and to treat the side effects of medication including chemotherapy. Acupuncture has also been shown to increase blood circulation, decrease inflammation, boost the immune system, and even regulate mood. Herbal Medicine & Eastern Nutrition Herbal medicine works hand in hand with acupuncture to resolve immediate symptoms and to also treat the root cause of the condition. Traditionally, herbs were prescribed in raw form and made into tea to drink throughout the day. Today, most herbs are encapsulated or compressed into pills for convenience and compliance. We always like to remind our clients that herbs only work if you take them :) Eastern nutrition includes herbal therapy as well as individualized dietary recommendations that support the healing process. Herbal and nutritional consultations are usually included with acupuncture treatments, but can also be scheduled individually. Please contact us for more information. Fire Cupping Cupping has been part of Traditional Chinese Medicine for thousands of years and has become more popular in the last decade with athletes like Michael Phelps showing off their cupping marks during the Olympics. Cupping is great for enhancing muscle recovery and relaxing tight muscles but can also help detox the body, improve circulation and help resolve upper respiratory congestion and aids in cold/flu recovery. Different methods of cupping include stationary, flash and sliding and usage is determined based on the condition being treated. Gua Sha Gua Sha is a scraping therapy that is used to relieve muscle tension and stiffness, decrease inflammation and support the immune system. Gua Sha can also be used as a facial rejuvenation treatment in help increase blood circulation and collagen production to reduce the signs of aging. Cosmetic Acupuncture Acupuncture for facial rejuvenation has become a popular, natural alternative to Botox. Tiny facial needles are placed at acupuncture points specifically to help reduce wrinkles, lift and tone the skin, and to encourage blood circulation and collagen production locally. Facial rejuvenation acupuncture treatments are usually paired with facial gua sha, jade roller therapy or facial cupping to enhance the overall effects. Anti-aging signs may be seen with a few treatments, but a series of treatments are usually recommended for maximum benefits. "}
