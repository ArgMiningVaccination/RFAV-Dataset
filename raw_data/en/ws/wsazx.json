First, let's take a more in-depth look into acupuncture or needling. This alternative medicine involves stimulating certain parts of the body with fine needles. During the treatment, a professional will use the needles to penetrate the skin. Experts believe that needling first emerged in China over one millennium ago. Its success tends to vary significantly from one person to another. Despite the mixed results, scientists in the United States and Europe find it at least moderately effective at treating pain. Why does needling work, though? The placement of the needles makes this form of treatment effective. Experts say that needling relies on neurohormonal pathways in the body. In understandable terms, the needles stimulate nerves that send signals directly to the brain. For needling to work effectively, experts have to hit specific nerves. When the needles hit the correct ones, the brain receives signals to release certain endorphins and hormones. These chemicals make people feel happy and euphoric and can even lessen pain. How Does Needling Help During Addiction Recovery? Acupuncture is popular among [addiction therapies](/addiction-treatment-programs/addiction-therapy/). Experts use it as a natural way to help people deal with the pain that they experience during withdrawal. It's particularly beneficial for those with addictions to prescription painkillers. Eastern acupuncturists believe that needling opens up blocked energy pathways in the body too. These pathways play a significant role in helping people achieve balance in their lives. Needling also helps people relax and reduces stress naturally. These kinds of benefits aid the drug detox process. In most cases, people use needling to treat the whole body. During detox and rehab, however, experts typically focus more on crucial parts of the body. These usually include the heart, kidneys, and liver. The reason why is because drugs tend to weaken these areas of the body the most. Acupuncture Can Also Balance Emotions People have many emotions during detox and drug rehab. Needling can help them balance these feelings, which makes it easier for them to focus on their detox programs. Some people simply break down and cry after their first needling treatments. Experts say that it happens because of the rush of emotions that surface as the body starts to balance itself. While the balancing process is intense, it's necessary before people can center themselves.
