[QD463 .A7](http://oasis.oregonstate.edu/search/c?SEARCH=QD463+.A7) Aston (1877-1945) received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1922. This is his classic publication in which he details his experiments demonstrating the existence of isotopes. This work led to \"the reconstruction of the table of atomic weights. . . (showing) that they are only in exceptional cases whole numbers when considered as multiples of the weight of a hydrogen atom. The ultimate consequences of these discrepancies are far-reaching. The ratio between hydrogen and helium is not 4:1 as it 'should' be, but rather less; which means that when four atoms of hydrogen are transformed into one helium atom some matter is annihilated. In fact this is an example of the interchangeability between mass and energy which is postulated in Einstein's Isotopes . Illustrated with 21 figures and 4 full page plates. VIII, 152 p. 8vo.

Curie's work can be divided into 3 periods. The first concerned the physics of crystals, and led to the discovery of piezoelectricity. In the second period Curie concentrated on theoretical problems of crystallography and magnetism. The third period mainly involved study of radioactivity with his wife, Marie, in perhaps the greatest and most romantic husband/wife collaboration in the history of science.

Nier here reports his study of Uranium isotopes as a tool for geological dating; he finds only 3 isotopes, determines their relative abundances, and calculates their half-lives; most importantly, Nier used a mass spectrograph for the separations and he was in a position to respond to the urgent need, recognized just weeks later, for separated isotopes to determine which isotope fissioned with slow neutrons; sufficient material was not available until early 1940 to prove conclusively that U-235, not U-238, fissioned with thermal neutrons. 0202.

Only recently, in June of 1989, has the Soviet Union admitted that the disaster occurred. Curiously, the United States, which also knew of the disaster since the 1950's (it was while attempting to photograph the disaster site that the flyer Gary Powers was shot down over the Soviet Union) also failed to admit its occurrence at the time, some say for fear of shaking public confidence in atomic energy during the push for reactor development in the late 1950's and early 1960's. Medvedev's book was an astonishing piece of detective work, and is finally vindicated. 2480. MEDVEDEV, ZHORES A. Nuclear Disaster in the Urals.
