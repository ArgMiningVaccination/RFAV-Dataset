Her lower extremities are turning purple and toes are black from poor circulation, not to mention they stay freezing. She has a lesion on the left side of her brain and I'm watching her heath get worse along with her quality of life. Can you recommend anything that may help her?\" Answer: Hello, M My heart goes out to you and your friend! Normally, I'd try to suggest only about half the amount of crystals I'm going to list for you. However, MS causes such a variety of physical, mental and emotional issues, I want to cover as many needs as I can, when giving you choices. Below, I will link the crystals I feel can be beneficial for your friend with the applicable properties listed beneath. As a person providing emotional support to your friend, you may wish to consider some of the crystals for yourself too, for their comforting, nurturing properties.

I had not heard of bronze before. I was just diagnosed and not yet come to terms with it. I've several of the crystals, I just made a pair of pyrite earrings and had no intention of keeping them, but I will be putting them on when I get up off the floor. My bed looks like elves should be around it, I bought it before I was rear ended and from there my health went from being in great shape to having to sit and hug my pillow on the couch after cleaning just the toilet (mind you I'm ocd and get out the qtips and toothpicks). It's so soft it makes sleeping painful. As well as stress, they should have some sort of program for your family. My kids are great with helping me but fight over the smallest thing. I need crystals for of them, L\u00edo, Scorpio and Capricorn. Guess I know what I'm doing tonight. Thank you again for a very well made list.
