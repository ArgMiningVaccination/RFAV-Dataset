We are compassionate and attentive listeners, who will take all of your concerns into consideration to implement a treatment plan that is tailored for you. Chinese medicine is a whole person approach, both mentally and physically. Many times, our emotional and mental state will also manifest physically, creating imbalances or blocked energy in the body. Through acupuncture, we are facilitating you to heal from within and activate your parasympathetic nervous system to relax so that it alleviates pain and calms the mind. We will guide and nurture you so you will feel taken care of and assist you in reaching your health goals. All practitioners here have similar technique and style and have experience with the specialties listed below. If you have additional questions before you start, give us a call or send an email and we are happy to answer you. We hope to see you soon!\" ~Linda Wentz, L.Ac |Owner Our Specialties "}
