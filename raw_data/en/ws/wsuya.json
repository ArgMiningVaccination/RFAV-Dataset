Six months ago, I was 100% pro-vaccine. When I look back now, I am ashamed to say that I was so pro-vaccine, that I publicly shamed anti vaccine parents and arguments. I am so not proud of this. I am openly so embarrassed, and so ashamed, that I had this opinion and worst of all, treated others this way. I was naive. Scared. Uneducated. Simply, living under some sort of assumption that someone else knew better than me. Back in February, we had a scare with Cece that landed us in the emergency room with her. Never in my whole life did I think I would be the mom that \"advocated\" for her child and went against doctor's recommendations. But I did. It was pure instinct, that the doctor was going too far. That he was pushing for something that we didn't truly need. We went home that night, and turns out, my mother's intuition was right. Home was where we needed to be, and I cringe at the thought of what may have happened if we had chosen to stay and follow his protocol. I trust doctors. I have watched doctors perform miracles on people I love. I have been witness to spectacular healing, because of western medicine. I believe in vaccines. I believe that they save our population from many devastating circumstances that may, very likely, wipe out entire populations. I believe the best in others. Oftentimes, I have to remind myself that the Bill of Rights and the Ten Commandments are NOT the same document. I so badly want to believe that humans work towards what is right and to do no harm unto others. I have learned VERY QUICKLY that even though I hold steadfast to these beliefs, that I have been much too complacent. And my God given gift of critical thinking has been lost somewhere in the desire to trust others. I'm not sure where along the line I was taught to rely on government or doctors or lawyers to teach me what is true. It's something I'll do differently with my own children, now. From now on, I will question science, question faith, question law, question government, and see where it stands in my own intuition. What does the Bible say about it? When I pray about it, what is He saying back? How does my gut feel? Have I researched this with sources I find credible? There was a night when Joey was a mere four months old when he got his first big set of vaccines. We didn't think anything of it. We did what our pediatrician recommended. And then Adam looked at me and said, \"He's not the same baby.\" And he wasn't. I can't recall what exactly was different, I'm not sure we even really could put a finger on it. But he was different. I had never read a vaccine insert before. I had never even opened a \"study\" that these \"anti-vaxers\" cited. Well, I have now. I will admit, it is damn hard to know what to believe. If we've learned nothing else from this plandemic, it's that there can be science to prove anything. Pick a side, and you can find science to support it. Or worse, a side of government to support it. And I am still very much working through all of this. The last three months particularly, I have dove deep into vaccines, the law behind mask mandates, and the lifelong trauma of a society shutdown. These are the topics I've found I stand strong in right now. There are AN INSANE amount of things we could passion drive right now, and these are mine. And while I've openly talked a lot about the mask mandates and government overreach into shutting down our society, what I've been careful to research behind the scenes and not let opinion drive my research on, is vaccines. Through my vaccine research, I've discovered what heavy metal toxicity really means. I've realized what we are putting into our bodies, through many substrates, contains metals that our bodies cling onto, that spread toxic poison throughout our bodies, and cause a plethora of problems that we could so easily attribute to literally anything else. It's no coincidence that vaccine makers are indemnified from vaccine harm. It's no coincidence that my children get fevers, nausea and lethargy after getting their vaccines. It's no coincidence that SIDS takes the life of more children within 48 of vaccine injection than ANY OTHER TIME in infant life. These things got me questioning. Major questions. Life changing, do no harm types of questions. So I started at the beginning. What is in a vaccine. Lots of crap, to be honest. But mostly, aluminum. Bad aluminum. Not the naturally occurring, safe kind that we all ingest on the regular. No, the bad kind that is injected straight into your bloodstream, is not processed by your gut but instead by your liver, kidneys and you guessed it, your brain. This is where I started. There is A LOT more to discover and learn and understand, but before I can stand firm in a place of pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, I know I need to help my family get rid of the toxins that have been floating around their bodies for as long as they have. And I know that Cece needs to get her MMR vaccine, so how can I better help her body cope. If you find it overwhelming, like me, to start down this rabbit hole, I'm telling you to start here. Start with what you know. Start with taking care of your body, your family's body, and keeping it functioning to the best of its ability. So this is where we started. About a month ago, Cece got her one year vaccines, and I immediately took her into detox mode afterwards. And I think it truly truly helped. Especially the first few days. Before we dive into the three things I think truly helped Cece with her vaccine detox, I want to clarify a few things. Five days after her vaccine (MMR - measles, mumps, rubella), she developed a strikingly high fever and we got very scared. After some research and asking some hard questions, I'm fairly certain she had \"mini measles,\" which happens in about 17% of MMR vaccine injection infants. Since the MMR vaccine is a \"live\" vaccine, it is putting the live virus into the system for the immune system to fight off, thus creating immunity. Sometimes, the vaccine does cause a \"small part of the virus\" (using quotes here because I'm MAJORLY paraphrasing) to show symptoms of the live virus. Thus creating a \"mini reaction\". Cece had a 105 fever, small bumps on her extremities and heavy nausea. All signs of the mini measles. The MMR vaccine's incubation period is approximately 7-14 days, meaning that the virus is alive and well in a baby's system for approximately that long. Vaccine detox does not negatively affect the effectiveness of the vaccine. DETOX BATH I put Cece into a detox bath immediately after getting home from her appointment, and again for the following three days. I did a sink bath for her since she is still so small, so if you're going to do a tub bath, make sure to increase the amount of ingredients accordingly. \u00bc cup epsom salt \u00bc cup baking soda \u00bc cup unfiltered apple cider vinegar A few drops lavender essential oil A detox bath doesn't \"draw out the toxins\" through your skin, as one might think. The ingredients in a detox bath are actually absorbed through the skin and promote detoxification, helping your body rid toxins through natural ways such as bowel movements, urine and sweat. Epsom salt is magnesium and sulphate, absorbed wonderfully through the skin, aiding in many things, but most importantly, boosting circulation. Baking soda boosts liver function.. Apple cider vinegar aids in anti inflammation but also boosts your sweat glands. DETOX SMOOTHIE I gave Cece a detox smoothie for dinner that night, and then again each morning for about 5 days. Again, helping to promote the body to detox from the inside out. The important ingredients of a detox smoothie: Wild blueberries Cilantro Spirulina Barley grass/wheat grass Wild blueberries draw out the heavy metals from your brain tissue. Wild right? Also FULL of antioxidants, making them optimal for fighting viruses. Cilantro extracts metals deep in your tissues, binding themselves to old cells. Barley grass prepares mercury to be absorbed by an outside source, particularly in your spleen, intestines, and thyroid. Spirulina soaks up the mercury extracted by the barley grass and also aids in drawing out heavy metals from your central nervous system. I made an adult size smoothie (actually, I've made one every morning for three weeks now), and I pour about half a cup into a cup for Cece before I drink the rest. \u00bd cup blueberries (frozen) 1 banana \u00bd cup orange juice 1 scoop Greens from Arbonne (contains spirulina and barley grass, win win) \u00bc cup fresh cilantro 3 or 4 florets frozen cauliflower (for other reasons, but it's good for you) SUNLIGHT It is absolutely no secret how much true UV rays can help our bodies. Boosting immunity, getting some natural vitamin D, and promoting sweat are just a few of the many, but also the few that are best for detoxification. Sweat is one of the best ways to rid toxins from your body. So since she can't really go do a sweat sesh in the gym, sunlight was the best way to do this! Taking some time to be truly in the sun is important. Not so long that you are burning or over heating or anything like that. But just long enough to get some sweat going, vitamin D soaked up, and you start to feel like a new person. I took Cece out into the sunshine for about 10 minutes, purposely, each day for a few days. We walked outside in her diaper and sat on a blanket on the lawn until she started to sweat just a touch on her forehead, then we promptly went back inside to cool down. But when is a good time to detox? Well, for your kiddos, after vaccines is definitely a must. But really, detoxing on the regular is great for everyone! There is no particularly bad time. Keep in mind to keep yourself and your kiddos nice and hydrated while detoxing, since you're pouring out all those toxins through fluid. So much more to come on the vaccine front... but for now, I'm working to rid my family and myself of some lifelong heavy metal toxicity and in a way that feels right for us. I hope you "}
