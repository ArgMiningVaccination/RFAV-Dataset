She has been coughing for 72 days. \"Not on and off coughing, but continuously, every day and every night, for two and a half months. And not just coughing, but whooping: doubled over, body clenched, sucking violently for air, my face reddening and my eyes watering. Sometimes, I cough so hard, I vomit. Other times, I pee myself,\" she writes in The New Republic, where she is a senior editor.", "sitename": "The Knight Science Journalism Program @MIT", "date": "2013-11-12", "cleaned_text": "which corrects some misinformation in Ioffe's piece and suggests that maybe this wasn't Jenny McCarthy's fault after all.] Julia Ioffe exactly](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115551/jenny-mccarthy-anti-vaccination-movement-blame-whooping-cough?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=margin&utm_campaign=mostpopular). She has a \"100-day cough,\" otherwise known as pertussis, or whooping cough. She has been coughing for 72 days. \"Not on and off coughing, but continuously, every day and every night, for two and a half months. And not just coughing, but whooping: doubled over, body clenched, sucking violently for air, my face reddening and my eyes watering. Sometimes, I cough so hard, I vomit. Other times, I pee myself,\" she writes in The New Republic, where she is a senior editor. The good news is she has only a month or so left to whoop, meaning her colleagues have \"a good month of my hackery left to joke about.\" Fortunately, she is an adult and will likely survive. Many infants with whooping cough don't. She doesn't blame Bordetella pertussis, the bacterium responsible for the whoops. \"We've come to think of it as an ailment suffered in sub-Saharan Africa or in Bront\u00eb novels. And for two or three generations, it was,\" she writes. \"Until, that is, the anti-vaccination movement really got going in the last few years.\" She doesn't bother to explain why she blames Jenny McCarthy, because, as most readers should know, McCarthy has been a prominent vaccine denialist. Ioffe makes clear that McCarthy's personal decision regarding her children has important public-health consequences. Namely, it can allow the disease to once again gain a foothold in the U.S. population. This is a short piece; Ioffe could have said more, and I would have been eager to read it. But she might argue that, in this case, that would dilute her message, which is this: \"So thanks a lot, anti-vaccine parents. You took an ethical stand against big pharma and the autism your baby was not going to get anyway, and, by doing so, killed some babies and gave me, an otherwise healthy 31-year-old woman, the whooping cough in the year 2013.\" The personal is political. [Update 11/12: Ioffe notes that [she was vaccinated](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115555/i-got-vaccinated-whooping-cough-i-shouldnt-need-booster-too?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=intext&utm_campaign=curated), but reports that the vaccine wears off in adults. When all children were vaccinated, that didn't matter. "}
