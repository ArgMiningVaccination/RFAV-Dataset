OUR PROGRAM: The Samasthala 200-hour intensive teacher-training programme, allows you to become versed in a true form of Yoga. Set amongst a magical mountain location in Selemadeg, Bali, surrounded by lush jungle greenery and endless rice fields and terraces. Our YTT syllabus covers a wide range of subjects, in an easy to digest and accessible format. This includes philosophy, asana, 14 meridians, pranayama, the five elements, safe practice, bandha, anatomy and physiology, yoga for trauma therapy, meditation and much more. OUR VOICE: In a time when many stray away from the true path, we remain 'fundamental' in our simplicity, by adhering to the roots of what we believe yoga is meant to be. That which is a wonderful gift, an instrument, used to attune the individual soul 'atman' with the universal chords of truth. The word Samasthala translates to 'balance'. We recognise the importance of balancing a strong ashtanga styled vinyasa flow and yin and incorporate this into our curriculum. Rarely do 200-Hour Yoga Alliance approved teacher-training programmes equip the Yogi with an understanding of both. However, we recognise that the opposites of yin and yang is what allows for the existence of all things. OUR REACH: The Samasthala 200-hour Yoga Alliance certified teacher-training course, is suitable for students seeking an international yoga qualification, or for those just wanting to go further into their practice. Upon graduation, you will be equipped with the best tools needed to teach yoga anywhere in the world and endowed with a deep sense of connection with self. This distinct and exclusive Bali 200-Hour YTT accommodates individual expression and teaching style, whilst offering a strong educational foundation, to facilitate a variation of teaching options for differing clientele.

The surrounding area of this retreat center is very tranquil, this will help you stay focused and energized. Really good to restore your Prana, the master guiding force within the body. We live in a time where the Yang qualities of goal orientation, directional focus, achievement, & \"getting shit done\" in the world, saturate our value system. Within the last 60 years, inspired women of the western world have duplicated this potent Yang focus in order to courageously stake their equality & autonomy & express their voice & contribution in the world. As a result women are well on the way to re-instating their social, political & economic freedom . And yet when relentless yang outward moving energy is not balanced with equal priority for yin inward moving energy, this imminently leads to the detriment of our physical & psycho- emotional health, as women. And often manifests as hormonal & reproductive disorders, depression, anxiety & burn out . We are now coming to realise that true equality & liberation lies in equally valuing, understanding & embodying the inherent quality of Yin. Yin qualities include Embodiment & the subsequent access to somatic & emotional intelligence that an inward lens invokes. Informing greater self awareness & thus conscious relationship within & without. Inviting the potential to create both heart & earth centred community & self referencing our true source of freedom within our own beings . As women, inside of our bodies moves a potent feminine current of awakening, a river of Shakti birthed from the temple of our Wombs. It is our birthright. A source of power that has been muted for thousands of years that is beckoning us to Re-Member. When surrendered to, this current unravels the postured conditioning of the minds story of separation, WITHIN THE BODIES TISSUE. An infinite intelligence that spontaneously unwinds the tension stored in our connective tissue created from identifying with thoughts & behaviours that are out of alignment with our True Nature. Creating space for infinite insight & knowing to arise in & through our BODIES & repattern our nervous systems from the inside out. This current permeates through all the unconscious places of hiding from the truth of who we are & translates into directly experiential shifts in perception & behaviour, melting the heart open to experience the uncontrived Love & Wholeness that is our birth right. SHE is currently Rising through our bodies & hearts en masse, invoking our re-memberance. Inviting us to become embodied vehicles for Her Wisdom to move through us, unimpeded by our personal story of insecurity & separation. In order to step into reclaim our birthright , to Re-Member Her Essence within our bodies , our sensual essence & our wombs. Returning to our fullness as INTEGRATED & EMBODIED Awake Women, bringing balance back to our earth in this potent time of transformation & evolutionary change. Are you feeling HER call ? Embark on a powerful journey into the Feminine Way of teaching and practising Yoga. You will learn about the history of women and yoga, including yogic myths and stories, the role of women in Tantra yoga and the great wisdom Goddesses, the Mahavidyas.

Many of the systems and structures we've put in place clearly aren't working, in fact they are crumbling and collapsing. And, so are we. A predominantly traumatised and dis-embodied society has resulted in numbness to the natural world, a misplaced worship of material things, and a subsequent disconnect from our own senses, selves and the environment that surrounds us. The U.N reports that 75% of trauma doesn't come from a battlefield, refugee camp or natural disaster, such as an earthquake, it is interpersonal. Inflicted by one person over another, often purposefully. In other words, every 'body' in our yoga classes holds unresolved trauma. In this post #MeToo era, which affects men and women alike, as teachers, we are being called to step into greater service. To learn how to cultivate, create and provide containers of deeper safety and presence, both in ourselves and for others, to educate ourselves about consent, safe touch vs. triggering or re-traumatising touch, to raise our awareness around embodiment and the conditions, survival strategies and patterns of armouring and protection that keep us in the states of avoidance, spiritual bypass and disembodiment. So that we can ground, regulate our nervous systems, reconnect to the earth and to each other. By developing our therapeutic presence we can, in the moment, more fully attune to ourselves and our students on a multitude of levels\u2014physically, emotionally, cognitively, somatically and spiritually. Offering others the opportunity to really feel safe and seen, possibly for the first time. This is an essential step in providing spaces where painful or rejected parts and traumatic experiences from the past can begin to be acknowledged and integrated. "}
