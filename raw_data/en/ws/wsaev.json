Rejuvenating Willka T'ika facials use natural products infused with ingredients from our healing gardens. Experience the benefits of a masque suffused with the ancient energy of fruit from our thousand-year-old lucuma tree, or with honey made by bees visiting Willka T'ika's flowers.

Our reflexology treatments incorporate the healing benefits of salt from the nearby Maras salt farms, or traditional aromatherapy essential oils. Solar Baths Experience an outdoor floral bath under a velvet night sky bejeweled with the Milky Way. The unique solar baths, created from stone and set in secluded garden spots, are heated by the sun during the day. At night the water is infused with flowers, medicinal herbs, and medicinal Maras salt. Enjoy a luxurious soak under the stars before bed.

Sound Healing Sound Ceremonies (or what is commonly known as \"Sound Healing\") are offered for a minimum group size of 4. This healing ceremony has the power to penetrate our habitual thought patterns, permitting us to reduce our mental activity and reach a profound state of relaxation. With a variety of beautiful instruments from around the world, our talented musician will help guests balance mental and physical equilibrium and reach a place of internal harmony.

The delicious, chocolate beverage is prepared with love by our staff and served in a musical, meditative ceremony by a shamanic facilitator. The sweetness of this ceremony can cause deep relaxation or animated dancing, or both. Crystal Light Therapy Relax and rejuvenate as your energy centers return to balance. Crystal light therapy combines color, light, quartz crystals, and music to clear and realign the body's chakras.
