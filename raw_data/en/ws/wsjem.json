We also sell single concentrated [essential oils](https://www.arogya.net/shop/essential-oils) and a few signature blends, and often get questions from our customers, such as \"What exactly are essential oils and how can I use them in my everyday life?\" How Aromatherapy Works Aromatherapy is a holistic healing treatment that uses natural plant extracts in a variety of ways to heal the body, mind, and spirit. Sometimes called essential oil therapy, aromatherapy focuses on the medicinal value of oils and is considered a synergy of art and science. Aromatherapy oils can be diffused and inhaled or diluted with carrier oils and applied topically. Each essential oil offers unique healing properties and experienced practitioners can create multifaceted blends that enhance the qualities of individual oils. What Are Essential Oils? Essential oils are extracted from flowers, roots, bark, and leaves and are the highly concentrated life essence of a plant. They contain powerful healing compounds that can support the mind, body, and spirit. While many of the therapeutic benefits of essential oils have been studied and measured, the most mysterious and invisible quality - the scent - can transport us to other realms, invoking memories and creating harmony. With roots in ancient spiritual and cultural practices, essential oils have a deep history throughout the world. Cleopatra was known to bathe in an intoxicating blend of Jasmine, Rose, Neroli, and Frankincense. Myth has it that the sails of her ships were coated with this aroma, luring her lovers as she arrived in their ports. Each essential oil has its own unique qualities and benefits. When shopping, you may notice diverse price differences between different oils. This is because each plant contains a different quantity of oil in its core. For example, citrus oils such as Sweet Orange are extracted by pressing the rind of the fruit. Many tiny capsules inside the rind release much of the sweet-smelling oil, and therefore the cost per ounce is relatively inexpensive. Precious oils such as Rose yield only 1 drop of oil per 67 petals and therefore are more for costly. Because essential oils are 75-100 times more concentrated than the oils found in dried herbs, just a few drops can have very powerful effects. It's important to distinguish essential oils from synthetic fragrances. Many cosmetic and home cleaning products on the market today contain artificial scents. These scents are hidden under the broad title of \"fragrance,\" and are made from chemicals in a lab with no natural origin. Below is a chart that we have created to help distinguish the difference. Essential Oils vs. Synthetic Fragrances People may not always have the awareness of natural vs. synthetic scents, but humans respond in a profoundly different way in the presence of naturally derived essential oils. This is because the scents from nature and our olfactory system have coexisted and coevolved for millions of years, so it makes sense that our minds and bodies would have a more profound emotional response to natural scents. So, how can we tell the difference when purchasing products? Always read the label. The words \"fragrance\" and \"perfume\" usually indicate scents that don't come from nature. In the United States, companies are not legally required to disclose what is in their fragrance blends. The word \"fragrance\" is used as an umbrella term for hundreds of different chemicals blended to make a certain smell. Instead, look for labels that have specific ingredients, such as, \"Lavender Essential Oil\" or \"Lavendula Angustifolia.\" Using Essential Oils in Everyday Life Making your own cosmetic and cleaning products at home using essential oils is a lot easier than you may think.

How Can You Use Essential Oils Safely? - Essential oils are extremely potent so it is important to dilute them in vegetable oil or water before applying to the skin. You can try a patch test on the inside of the wrist and wait 24 hours to see how the oil affects your skin. - Citrus oils are UV-sensitive - avoid sun exposure on the skin that you have applied citrus for at least 24 hours. - Do not take essential oils internally. - Keep your oils well sealed and out of direct sunlight. They keep better in the refrigerator. - Keep away from eyes and mucous membranes. Always wash hands after use. - For children and women who are pregnant, consult an Aromatherapist before using essential oils. By Alyssa Crouse, LMT "}
