The exact timeframe is noted on each page. The report shows information about your PCMH practice \u2014 For pooled practices, the information for your shared performance entity will be provided in the shared performance entity report (see \"Guide to Reading Your Pool Report\") \u2014 All PCMHs who are associated with a pool will receive a shared performance entity report. The PCMH program seeks to reward primary care physicians for high-quality care that drives system-wide quality and ef ciency. The PCMH program is part of the Arkansas Health Care Payment Improvement Initiative, a multi-payer collaboration between Arkansas Blue Cross Blue Shield, Arkansas Medicaid, Arkansas State and Public School Employees Plan, QualChoice of Arkansas, Arkansas Health and Wellness Solutions, United Healthcare and Walmart.

Each calendar year, the program is re ned a bit, with its own list of practice support activities and incentive, core, quality, and informational metrics. Although each program spans one calendar year, claims processing takes time. More than 95% of claims are led and processed within three months, but Medicaid rules give providers 365 days from the date of service to le claims, so each calendar year will continue to be processed for 12 further months. Therefore, a practice that is enrolled inthe 2018 program will continue to receive reports for several quarters, and if that practiceis also enrolled in the 2019 program, it will receive a separate report for that con guration. Additionally, the Arkansas PCMH program requires at least 1,000 bene ciaries be attributed to a PCMH for at least six months in order for that PCMH to be eligible for shared performance payments. To help more practices qualify for these payments, PCMHs below that threshold may voluntarily pool with other PCMHs to reach the 1,000-bene ciary threshold, and any small PCMH not enrolled in a pool will be placed in either the statewide default pool or the petite pool for shared performance purposes. Each PCMH enrolled in a voluntary pool, the petite pool, or the statewide default pool will receive both a provider report that pertains only to that PCMH and a pool report (also called a shared performance entity report), which contains data from all PCMHs in the pool. Standalone PCMH practices that have at least 1,000 attributed bene ciaries will only receive a provider report. Starting in 2019, all practices with less than 300 bene ciaries may voluntarily pool with other PCMHs to reach the 1,000 minimum requirement. Finally, though the Arkansas PCMH program runs on a calendar-year basis and metrics are processed quarterly, provider reports allow PCMHs to see how their performance compares to the state-wide average across a 12-month period. Because of the time required for claims processing, each report's 12-month time frame will end either about six months prior to when the report will be released or at the end of the con guration's calendar year. These reports are usually released near the end of each calendar quarter. So near the end of the third quarter of 2019, for example, a PCMH that was enrolled in both the 2018 and 2019 versions of the program and was in a voluntary pool both years will receive a 2018 provider report and a 2018 pool report, which both will cover the period ranging from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018, and a 2019 provider report and a 2019 pool report, which both will cover the period ranging from April 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019.0PCMH Report for Period of 10/01/2017 to 09/30/2018 PCMH Configuration - 2019 Performance Period: Little Rock Clinic NOTICE: Health information included in this report is protected under HIPAA rules.
