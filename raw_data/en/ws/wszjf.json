Allergy season is no fun for anyone, so finding the right remedy for your allergies is important. First and foremost, you should find out what allergies are affecting you the most. For example, some [common allergies](https://beginwithinscottsdale.com/allergies-in-arizona-by-season/) in Arizona include Palo Verde pollen, dust, and more. Individuals who deal with these allergies may end up with a stuffy nose, itchy eyes, nasal drip, and congestion. While these symptoms vary from person to person, all of these allergies share something in common: they impact your immune system. So, the best natural remedies for seasonal allergies will be ones that help strengthen your immune system. This will not only help you deal with those pesky symptoms but also help you avoid those symptoms in the future! To help you this allergy season, we've put together some natural remedies for seasonal allergies for you to consider. Natural Remedies for Seasonal Allergies Visit a Chiropractor The first remedy on our list is chiropractic care. If your immune system isn't functioning as it should, the right chiropractic care can help get you back on track. Additionally, chiropractic care is also a great preventive measure to take against allergies by indirectly strengthening your immune system. Regardless, you might be wondering how chiropractic care can help your [immune system](https://beginwithinscottsdale.com/chiropractic-and-immune-system/). Chiropractic care helps to strengthen your immune system thanks to the [relationship](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2015/11/30/surprise-chiropractors-can-treat-these-5-conditions) between your body's immune, nervous, and endocrine systems. When one system isn't working right, the other two systems are also affected. Because chiropractic treatment focuses on the alignment of your spine, which is part of the nervous system, it is directly dealing with your nervous system's functionality. Indirectly, though, this treatment is aiding your body's other systems as well because of the close relationship between these systems. Let's say your spine is misaligned. If your spine is misaligned, your nervous system may not be functioning properly. Due to the pressure, this misalignment puts on the nerves in your neck, your brain's signals to the body can get interrupted. Hence, your nervous system isn't working as it should, which impacts the rest of your body, including your immune system. Manage Your Stress Another way to handle your allergies is by dealing with your stress. You might be surprised to learn the impact that stress can have on your body! As stress builds up in our bodies, it can manifest in physical symptoms, such as migraines, tense muscles, or even feeling sick. How you manage your stress is unique to your symptoms. For instance, stress is a [common reason](https://beginwithinscottsdale.com/reasons-to-see-a-chiropractor/) that some seek out chiropractic care. Other methods that you can also try include [acupuncture](https://beginwithinscottsdale.com/acupuncture-vs-chiropractor/), which helps regulate the energies in your body and lower stress. Some jobs offer corporate wellness programs that can help you deal with stress in the workplace as well. Avoid Your Allergens This might seem like a simple answer to avoid allergies, but it's true! Plus, you may not be aware of all the places you come into contact with your allergens. While you can't completely cut yourself off from certain outdoors allergens, like pollen, there are ways to avoid them, especially at home. If you deal with allergies like dust, pollen, or something similar, getting an air purifier can be a big help. Additionally, it never hurts to do some spring cleaning! Since allergens like dust can [build up in your home](https://hughesenv.com/15-facts-about-dust/), putting aside some time now and then to clean can help reduce those allergens. In the end, you'll feel better, not only because your home is cleaner, but also because you're dealing with fewer allergens!
