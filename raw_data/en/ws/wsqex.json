L. No. 106-554, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105 note), co mmonly known as the Regulatory \"Right-to- Know Act.\" The Report was published in draft form in April 2006 and covers the time period Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 through FY 2005. This final Report reflects revisions made to the draft based on public comment, external p eer review, and interagency review. A key feature of this Report is the estimates of the total costs and be nefits of regulations reviewed by the Office of Management and Budge t (OMB). Similar to previous Reports, the report includes a 10-year look-ba ck of major Federal regulations reviewed by OMB to examine their quantified and monetiz ed benefits and costs: The estimated annual benefits of major Fe deral regulations reviewed by OMB from October 1, 1995, to September 30, 2005, range from $94 billion to $449 billion, while the estimated annual costs range from $37 billion to $44 billion. The substantial increase in aggregate benefits since last year is attribut able to the addition of the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Interstate Rule. During FY 2005, 13 \"major\" final rules with quantified and monetized benefits and costs were adopted. These rules added $28 bi llion to $178 billion in annual benefits compared to $4.3 billion to $6.6 billion in annual costs. There were an additional eight final \"maj or\" rules during FY 2005 that did not have quantified and monetized estimates of both be nefits and costs. Two of these eight rules implemented homeland security pr ograms where the benefits of improved security are very difficult to quantify and monetize. In addition, we report the latest results of our ongoing historical examination of the trends in Federal regulatory activity. As explained in Chapter II of this Report, the data reveal that: The average yearly cost of the majo r regulations issued during the Bush (43) Administration is about 54 percent le ss than over the previous 20 years. The average yearly benefit of the ma jor regulations issued during the Bush (43) Administration is over double the yearly average for the previous eight years. Over the last 25 years, the major regulati ons reviewed by OMB have added at least $123 billion to the overall yearly co sts of regulations on the public. The benefits of major regulations i ssued from 1992 to 2005 exceed the costs by over three fold. Chapter III of the Report provides an update on various initiatives to improve regulatory cooperation internationally. This chapter focuse s on U.S. engagement with the European Union iii and with Canada and Mexico, as well as othe r efforts to promote greater cooperation and regulatory best practices. Appendix D presents a comparison of the European Commission's guidelines on regulatory impact analysis with those issued by OMB to Federal agencies. Chapter IV provides an update on agency impl ementation of the Information Quality Act (Section 515 of the Treasury a nd General Government Appropri ations Act, 2001 (Pub. L. No. 106-554, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3516 note)). The chapter su mmarizes the current status of correction requests that were received by agencies in FY 2005, and includes an upd ate on the status of requests received in FY 2003 and FY 2004. In Appendix E, OMB reports on the status of the regulatory reforms resulting from three recent public nomination initiatives. These initiatives, which occurred in 2001, 2002, and 2004, have been the subject of periodic status reports. Continuing OMB's recent practice, this Report is being subm itted along with the Eleventh Annual Report to Congress on Agency Compliance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. No. 104-4). In this Unfunded Mandates Report, OMB reports on agency compliance with Title II of the Act, which requires that each agency, before promulgating any proposed or final rule that may result in expenditu res of more than $100 million (annually adjusted for inflation) in any one year by State, local, and tribal governments, or by the private sector, to conduc t a cost-benefit an alysis and select the le ast costly, most cost- effective or least burdensome alternative. Each ag ency must also seek input from State, local, and tribal government. iv PART I: 2006 REPORT TO CONGRESS ON THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS v CHAPTER I: THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS Section 624 of the Treasury and General Gove rnment Appropriations Act of 2001, often called the \"Regulatory Right-to- Know Act,\" (Pub. L. No. 106-554, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105 note) calls for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to submit \"an accounting statement and associated report\" including: (A) an estimate of the to tal annual costs and benefits (including quantifiable and nonquantifiable effects) of Federal rules and paperwork, to the extent feasible: (1) in the aggregate; (2) by agency and agency program; and (3) by major rule; (B) an analysis of impacts of Federal regula tion on State, local, and tribal government, small business, wages, and economic growth; and (C) recommendations for reform. Since the statutory language does not further define \"major,\" for the purposes of this Report, we were broadly inclusive in defining \"m ajor\" rules. We have included all final rules promulgated by an Executive Branch agency that meet any one of the following three measures: Rules designated as \"major\" under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 804(2);1 Rules designated as anal ysis threshold under 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 1532;2 \"econo se ction 3(f)(1) of Executive Order of September 30, 1993, \"R egulatory Planning and Review.\"3 This chapter consists of the accounting statem ent and a brief report on regulatory impacts on State, local, and tribal governments, small bus iness, wages, and economic growth. Section A revises the benefit-cost estimates in last yea r's Report by updating the estimates to the end of fiscal year (FY) 2005 (September 30, 2005). Like the 2005 Report, this chapter uses a 10-year look-back: estimates are based on the major re gulations reviewed by OMB from October 1, 1A \"major rule\" is defined in Subtitle E of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996: Congressional Review of Agency Rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 804(2)) as a rule that is likely to result in: \"(A) an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more; (B) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local gov ernment agencies, or geographic regions; or (C) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterpri ses in domestic and export markets.\" 2A written statement containing a qualitative and quantitative a ssessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of the Federal mandate is required under the Section 202(a) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1532(a)) for all rules that may result in: \"the expenditure by State, local, and tribal gover nments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any 1 year.\" 3A regulatory action is considered \"economically significant\" under Executive Order 12866 3(f)(1) if it is likely to result in a rule that may have: \"an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, prod uctivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities.\" 1 1995, to September 30, 2005.4 This means that five rules reviewed from October 1, 1994, to September 30, 1995, were included in the totals for the 2005 Report but are not included in this Report. A list of these rules can be found in Appendix C (see Table C-1). Appendix C also includes a summary of eight rules included in th e 2004 Report but not included in the 2005 Report (see Table C-2), and a summary of 33 rules included in the 2003 Report but not included in the 2004 Report (see Table C-35). All of the estimates presented in this ch apter are based on agency information or transparent modifications of agen cy information performed by OMB.6 We also include in this chapter a discussion of major rules issued by \"independent\" regulatory agencies, although OMB does not review these rules under Executive Order 12866.7 This discussion is based on data provided by these agencies to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) under the Congressional Review Act. A. Estimates of the Total Benefits and Costs of Regulations Reviewed by OMB Table 1-1 presents an estimate of the total costs and benefits of 95 regulations reviewed by OMB over the ten-year pe riod from October 1, 1995, to September 30, 2005, that met two conditions.8 Each rule generated costs or benefits of at least $100 million in any one year, and a substantial portion of its costs and benefits were quantified and monetized by the agency or, in some cases, monetized by OMB. The estimates are therefore not a complete accounting of all the costs and benefits of all regulations issued by the Federal government during this period.9 As discussed in previous Reports, OMB has chosen a 10-year period for aggregation because pre- regulation estimates prepared for rules adopted more than ten years ago are of questionable relevance today. The estimates of the costs and benefits of Federal regulations over the period October 1, 1995, to September 30, 2005, are based on agency analyses subj ect to public notice and comments and OMB review under E.O. 12866. 4All previous Reports are available at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/infore g/regpol-reports_congress.html . 5 Note that the 11 entries in Table C-3 include a combin ed impact estimate from 23 original FDA food labeling rules. 6OMB used agency estimates where available. If an agen cy quantified but did not monetize estimates, we used standard assumptions to monetize them, as explained in Appendix A. Inflation adjustments are performed using the latest available GDP deflator and all amortizations are pe rformed using a discount rate of 7%, unless the agency has already presented annualized, monetized results using a different explicit discount rate. 7Section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866 excludes \"independent regulatory agencies as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(10)\". 8OMB discusses, in this report and in previous reports the difficulty of estimating and aggregating the costs and benefits of different regulations over long time periods and across many agencies using different methodologies. Any aggregation involves the assemblage of benefit and cost estimates that are not strictly comparable. In part to address this issue, the 2003 Report included OMB's regulatory analysis guidance, OMB Circular A-4, which took effect on January 1, 2004 for proposed rules and January 1, 2005 for final rules. The guidance recommends what OMB defines as \"best practice\" in regulatory analysis, with a goal of strengthening the role of science, engineering, and economics in rulemaking. The overall goal of this guidance is a more competen t and credible regulatory process and a more consistent regulatory environment. OMB expects that as more agencies adopt our recommended best practices, the costs and benefits we present in future reports will become more co mparable across agencies and programs. OMB is working with the agencies to ensure that their impact analyses follow the guidance. 9In many instances, agencies were unable to quantify all be nefits and costs. We have conveyed the essence of these unquantified effects on a rule-by-rule basis in the colu mns titled \"Other Information\" in Appendix A of this and previous Reports. The monetized estimates we pres ent necessarily exclude th ese unquantified effects. 2 The aggregate benefits and costs in Table 1-1 are substantially larger than the aggregate presented in the 2005 Report. The increase in benefits is due primarily to the addition of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rulema king, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, which primarily requires 28 states and the District of Columbia to revise their air quality State Implementation Plans to include control measures to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. This rule ge nerates estimated aver age yearly benefits of $50 billion to $60 billion. The increase in costs is due primarily to this Clean Air Intersta te Rule (about $1.8 billion in annual costs) and the Departme nt of Transportation's (DOT) Ti re Pressure Monitoring System rule (about $1 to $2 billion in annual costs). As can be seen in Tables 1-1 and 1-2, EPA rules continue to be responsible for the majority of costs and benefi ts generated by Federal regulation during this time period. Table 1-1: Estimates of the Total Annual Be nefits and Costs of Major Federal Rules, October 1, 1995 to September 30, 2005 (millions of 2001 dollars) Agency Number of Rules Benefits Costs Department of Agriculture 7 3,530-6,747 2,215-2,346 Department of Education 1 633-786 349-589 Department of Energy 6 5,194-5,260 2,958 Department of Health and Human Services 19 21,313-33,268 3,853-4,029 Department of Homeland Security (Coast Guard) 1 44 305 Department of Housing and Urban Development 1 190 150 Department of Justice 1 275 108-118 Department of Labor 4 1,138-3,440 349 Department of Transportation 13 2,913-4,948 3,212-6,622 Environmental Protection Agency 42 58,670-394,454 23,572-26,200 Total 95 93,899-449,412 37,071-43,665 Table 1-2 provides additional information on ag gregate benefits and costs for specific agency programs. In order for a program to be included in Table 1-2, the program needed to have finalized three or more rules in the last 10 years with monetized costs and benefits. The ranges of costs and benef its presented in Tables 1-1 and 1-2 are no t necessarily correlated. In other words, when interpreting th e meaning of these ranges , the reader should not assume that low benefits are associated with low costs and that high benefits are associated with high costs. Thus, for example, it is possible that the net benefits of EPA's water programs, taken together, could range from negative $2.1 bill ion to positive $6.8 billion per year. 3 Table 1-2: Estimates of Annual Benefits a nd Costs of Major Federal Rules: Selected Programs and Agencies, October 1, 1995-Se ptember 30, 2005 (millio ns of 2001 dollars) Agency Number of Rules Benefits Costs Department of Energy Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy 6 5,194-5,260 2,958 Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration 13 3,435-14,948 1,015-1,190 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 4 16,634 2,544 Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration 4 1,138-3,440 349 Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 8 2,070-4,105 2,123-5,532 Environmental Protection Agency Office of Air 30 55,321-376,686 17,534-19,797 Office of Water 9 1,425-10,066 3,203-3,568 Based on the information contained in this and previous Reports, the total costs and benefits of all Federal rules now in effect (major and non-ma jor, including those adopted more than 10 years ago) would be larger, and may be si gnificantly larger, than the sum of the costs and benefits reported in Table 1-1. More research is necessary to provide a stronger analytic foundation for comprehensive estimates of total costs and benefits by agency and program. In order for comparisons or aggregation to be meaningful, benefit and cost estimates should correctly account for all substantial effects of regulatory act ions, not all of which may be reflected in the available data. Any comparison or aggregation across rule s should also consider a number of factors that our pres entation does not address. To th e extent that agencies have adopted different methodologies \u2014for example, different monetized values for effects, different baselines in terms of the regulations and contro ls already in place, different rates of time preference, different treatments of uncertainty\u2014t hese differences remain embedded in Tables 1- 1 and 1-2. While we have relied in many instan ces on agency practices in monetizing costs and benefits, our citation of, or reli ance on, agency data in this Report should not be taken as an OMB endorsement of all the varied methodologies used to derive benefit and cost estimates. Many of these major rules have important non- quantified benefits and costs, which may have been a key factor in an agency's decisi on to promulgate a rulemaking. These qualitative issues are discussed in the agency rulemaking documents, in previous versions of this Report, and in Table A-1 in Appendix A of this Report. 4 The majority of the large estimated benefits of EPA rules are attri butable to the reduction in public exposure to a single air pollutant: fine particulate matte r. Thus, the favorable benefit- cost results for EPA regulation should not be genera lized to all types of EP A rules or even to all types of clean-air rules. In a ddition, the ranges of costs and be nefits presented in Tables 1-2 need to be treated with some caution. To the ex tent that the reasons for uncertainty differ across individual rules, aggregating high- and low-end estimates can result in totals that are extremely unlikely. In the case of the EPA rules reporte d here, however, a substantial portion of the uncertainty is similar across several rules: un certainty in the reducti on of premature deaths associated with reduction in particulate matter and the monetary value of reducing mortality risk. We continue to work with EPA to revise these ranges to reflect more fully the uncertainty in these estimates. As Table 1-2 indicates, the degree of uncertainty in benefit estimates for clean air rules is large. In addition, the wide rang e of benefits estimates for part icle control does not capture the full extent of the scientific uncertainty. The five key assumptions in the benefits estimates are as follows: Inhalation of fine particles is causally asso ciated with a risk of premature death at concentrations near those experienced by mo st Americans on a daily basis. While no definitive studies have yet established any of several potential biological mechanisms for such effects, the weight of the available epidemiological evidence supports an assumption of causality. All fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are equally potent in causing premature mortality. This is an important a ssumption, because fine particles formed from power plant SO 2 and NO x emissions are chemically different from fine particles emitted directly from both mobile sources and other in dustrial facilities, but no clear scientific grounds exist for supporting different ial effects by particle type. The concentration-response function for fine pa rticles is approximately linear within the range of outdoor concentrations under policy consid eration. Thus, the estimates include health benefits from reducing fine particles in both attainment and non-attainment regions. The forecasts for future emissions and a ssociated air quality modeling are valid. The valuation of the estimated reduction in mort ality risk is largely taken from studies of the tradeoff associated with the willingne ss to accept risk in the labor market. In response to recommendations from a committee of the National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences, EPA is working with OMB to improve methods to quantify the degree of technical unc ertainty in benefits estimates.10 10For more information on this study, please see Estimating the Public Health Benefits of Proposed Air Pollution Regulations , National Academy of Sciences, 2003. Available at http://books.nap.edu/catalog/10511.html . 5 B. Estimates of the Benefits and Costs of This Year's Major Rules In this section, we examine in detail the bene fits and costs of the 45 major final rules for which OMB concluded review during the 12- month period beginning October 1, 2004, and ending September 30, 2005. These major rules represent approximately 15 percent of the 292 final rules reviewed by OMB during this peri od, and approximately on e percent of the 3,980 final rules published in the Federal Register during this period. OMB believes, however, that the costs and benefits of major rules capture the vast majority of the total costs and benefits of all rules subject to OMB review.11 Of the 45 rules, 21 regulations were \"social regulations,\" which may require substantial additional private expenditures as well as provide new social benefits.12 Of the 21 \"social regulations,\" we are able to present estimates of both monetized costs and benefits for 13 rules. The estimates are aggregated by agency in Table 1-3, and each rule is summarized in Table 1-4. Two of the rules for which we were not able to present estimates of both costs and benefits implemented homeland security programs where the benefits of improved security are very difficult to quantify and monetize. 13 Both of these rules did estimate costs, and these costs, as well as the available information on benefits, are summarized in Table 1- 5. The six other final rules did not include monetized or quantified esti mates for both costs and benefits, thus we did not include those rules in the to tals in Tables 1-1 through 1-3. We attempt to summarize the available information on the impact of these rules in the \"other information\" column of Table A- 1. The remaining 24 regulations implemented Fe deral budgetary programs, which primarily caused income transfers, usually from taxpayers to program beneficiaries. Although rules that facilitate Federal budget programs are subjec t to E.O. 12866 and OMB Circular A-4, and are fully reviewed by OMB, this Report is focuse d on regulations that impose costs primarily through private sector mandates. Social Regulation Of the 45 economically significant rules reviewed by OMB, 21 regulations require substantial private expenditures or provide new social benefits. We are able to present monetized costs and benefits for about 60 percen t (13 of 21) of the rules, and for about 70 percent (13 of 19) of the non-homel and security rules. Since OMB began to compile this report, this is among the highest percen tage of economically significant rules presenting both monetized costs and monetized benefits. In last year's Re port, we were able to provide such monetized impacts for only 11 of 26 regulations.14 11We discuss the relative contribution of major rules to the total impact of Federal regulation in detail in the \"response-to-comments\" section on pages 26-27 of the 2004 Report. In summary, our evaluation of a few representative agencies found that major rules represented the vast majority of the costs and benefits of all rules promulgated by these agencies and reviewed by OMB. 12The Federal Register citations for these major rules are found in Table A-1 in Appendix A. 13See Chapter 4 in the 2003 Report (pp 64-80) for a more detailed discussion of this issue. 14Validating Regulatory Analysis: 2005 Report to Congress on the Costs and Benefits of Federal Regulations and Unfunded Mandates on State, Local, and Tribal Entities , p. 12. 6 Table 1-3 presents total benefits and costs by agency of these major rules reviewed by OMB over the past year and Table 1-4 provides a summary of each regulation. These tables are the basis for the totals in the accounting stat ement in Section A of this chapter. In assembling these tables of estimates of benefits and costs, OMB has applied a uniform format for the presentation of benefit and cost es timates in order to make agency estimates more closely comparable with each other (for example, annualizing benefit and cost estimates) and has monetized quantitative estimates where the agen cy has not done so. For example, we have converted agency projections of quantified benefits , such as estimated injuries avoided per year or tons of pollutant reductions per year, to dol lars using the valuation estimates discussed in Appendices A and B. Table A-1 in Appendix A also reports the av ailable impact information, as reported by the agencies, on all 21 of the social regulations reviewed by OMB in the time period covered by this Report.

The negative costs represent the relaxed requirements, relative to the 2003 rule, for short haul trucking. The positive benefits are due to the elimination of the 2003 rule's allowance of split resting periods in the truck's sleeper berth.

We also calculated an uncertainty interval using a method explained in Appendix B. 8 Rule Agency Benefits Costs Explanation of OMB Calculations Clean Air Visibility Rule EPA/ Air 2,302- 8,153 314-846 The low value of the range for costs and benefits is based on EPA Scenario 1. The \"high\" values of the range for cost and benefits was computed by combining the estimated NOx and SO2 Electricity Generating Units (EGU) emissions reductions from EPA's Scenario 2 with the estimated non-EGU emission reductions using a cost per ton value of $2,000 for reducing NOx and SO2. Cost estimates for the high value were estimated directly by EPA in the final impact analysis. Benefits estimates for the high value were derived by multiplying the combined emission reductions with OMB's high estimate of the benefits per ton from stationary sources for each pollutant presented in Appendix B. Clean Air Mercury Rule--Electric Utility Steam Generating Units EPA/ Air 1-2 500 EPA reported results in 2010 and 2018.

Beca use the benefits of homeland security regulations are a function of the likeliho od and severity of a hypoth etical future terrorist attack, they are very difficult to forecast, quan tify, and monetize. For the purposes of Table 1-5, we have annualized and converted the cost estimates to 2001 dollars in a manner similar to Table 1-4. We have also summarized th e available information on how th e agencies expect each of the rules will improve security or otherwise preven t or mitigate the consequences of a terrorist attack. OMB has also compiled the total impact of all major, economically significant homeland security rules that have been finalized since the creation of the DHS and that contain monetized costs. Since DHS was created, they have finalize d nine major homeland security regulations that impose a total cost on the economy of be tween $2.1 billion to $3.9 billion a year. 9 Table 1-5: Estimates of the Total Annual Be nefits and Costs of Major Federal Rules: Major Homeland Security Regulation, October 1, 2004-September 30, 2005 (millions of 2001 dollars) Rule Agency Benefits Costs Other Information Electronic Transmission of Passenger and Crew Manifests for Vessels and Aircraft DHS- BCBP Submission of manifest information is a necessary component of the nation's continuing program of ensuring aviation and vessel safety and protecting national security.

Regulations Implementing Federal Budgetary Programs Of the 45 economically significant rules revi ewed by OMB, Table 1-6 lists the 24 that implement Federal budgetary programs. Since the budget outlays associated with these rules are \"transfers\" from taxpayers to program beneficiaries (or fees collected from program beneficiaries), we refer to these rules as \"trans fer\" rules. The totals are: USDA, 6 rules; Department of Defense (DoD), 1 rule; HHS, 13 rules; DHS, 1 rule; HUD, 1 rule; DOL, 1 rule; and the Small Business Administration (SBA), 1 rule.

These notices are not final rules, since they implement changes to CMS pa yment systems driven by statutory formula and are not subject to notice and comment. We noneth eless list these notices below since they are considered \"major\" under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 804(2) and are reported to the GAO: Fee Schedule for Payment of Ambulance Services-Update for Calendar Year 2005 (CMS-1267-N) Inpatient Hospital Deductible and Hospital and Extended Care Services Coinsurance Amounts for Calendar Year 2006 (CMS-8026-N) Part A Premiums for Calendar Year 2006 for the Uninsured Aged and for Certain Disabled Individuals Who Have Exhaus ted Other Entitlement (CMS-8025-N) Medicare Part B Monthly Actuarial Rates and Premium Rate Beginning January 1, 2006 (CMS-8027-N) Please note that rules that tran sfer Federal dollars often have opportunity costs or benefits in addition to the budgetary dollars spent. Including budget programs in the overall totals would, however, overwhelm the incremental new regulatory impacts identified by this Report and would confuse the distinction between rules that impose costs primarily through the imposition of taxes, and rules that impose costs primarily through manda tes on the private sector. We also caution the reader not to assume that these rules were subject to less stringent analytical and review 11 requirements based on our less-detailed presentati on of Federal budget rules in this Report. In fact, agencies thoroughly analyze and OMB t horoughly reviews all significant Federal budget rules under E.O. 12866. If economically significant, these rules must be accompanied by regulatory impact analyses that co mply with OMB Circular A-4. D. Major Rules for \"Independent\" Regulatory Agencies The congressional review provi sions of the Small Busine ss Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) (Pub. L. No. 104-121) require the GAO to submit reports on major rules to the committees of jurisdiction, including rule s issued by agencies no t subject to Executive Order 12866, the so-called \"independ ent\" regulatory agencies. We reviewed the information on the costs and benefits of major rules containe d in GAO reports for the period of October 1, 2004, to September 30, 2005. GAO reported that four of these agencies issued 11 major rules during this period.15 In comparison to the agencies subject to E. O. 12866, these agencies provided in their analyses relatively little quantitative informa tion on the benefits of major rules: of the 21 economically significant rules reviewed by OMB, about 60 percent (13) reported monetized costs and benefits, whereas about 20 percent (2 of 11) of th e rules finalized by independent agencies reported monetized costs and benefits according to the GAO reports. As Table 1-7 indicates, most of the rules included some di scussion of benefits and costs, and reported monetized costs. OMB does not know whether the rigor and extent of th e analyses conducted by these agencies are similar to those of the an alyses performed by agencies subject to the Executive Order, since OMB does not review rules from these agencies.

Response to Peer Reviews and Public Comments on the Accounting Statement This chapter of the Report benefited from input we received from peer reviewers and commenters who responded to OMB's request for comments on the draft Report published earlier this year. 17 Peer reviewer 3 stated that the accounting statement is \"useful and thorough and valuable to researchers interested in regulato ry costs and benefits.\" Commenter F also stated that \"OMB has improved upon this year's repor t by adding links to the Regulatory Impact Analysis for some of the rules listed in its co st and benefit estimates. \" Several commenters, however, doubted the overall approach, stati ng that the accounting statement is highly misleading by its nature, provides a false preten se of accuracy and objectivity, and reflects OMB's continued support for cost-benefit anal ysis, which some commenters stated was a fundamentally flawed methodology (E, F). 17 See Appendix F for a listing of all the written comments we have received, and the numbers or letters we have assigned to their comments. The public and peer review comments are av ailable for review at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/regpol-reports_congress.html . 13 Comments on Scope/Coverage Commenter (D) questioned OMB's decision to include only major rules in our benefit and cost totals. The commenter questioned whet her this practice led OM B to neglect reporting the impact of many important rule s and therefore to underestimate the total costs and benefits of Federal rulemaking. The commenter stated that sin ce agencies themselves decide which rules are major, they are able to \"game\" their designations in order to avoid analysis of high impact rules. In the Draft Report, we stated that we incl uded only information on the benefits and costs of major rules because we believe that these costs and benefits capture the vast majority of the total costs and benefits of all rules subject to OMB revi ew. A comprehensive reassessment of every significant rulemaking is beyond the scope of this Report. In the final 2004 Report, we reassessed the relative importan ce of major versus non-major ru les for a selected group of agencies (OSHA, FDA, and NHTSA) and found that the costs and benefits of their significant, non-major rulemakings reviewed by OMB were a small fraction of the costs and benefits of their major rulemakings. We do see merit in periodically providing an in-depth review of major and non-major rules for individual agencies in order to continually test our as sumptions regarding the relative importance of major rules. Commenter D's characterization of the si gnificance determination process is overly simplified. Under E.O. 12866, Section 6, agencies must submit a list of planned regulatory actions to OIRA, and the agencies and OIRA jointly determine which of these actions are significant, economically signi ficant and major. OIRA reviews both significant and economically significant rules, and therefore has ample opportunity to explore whether the agency has properly considered and analyzed costs and benefits for rules that are not economically significant. We believe that this process provides a robust check on the accuracy of agency impact estimates. Two peer reviewers (1 and 3) and commenter (E) discu ss our treatmen t of homeland security regulations. Peer review (3) st ated that although OMB did a good job in the 2003 Report discussing the difficulties associated with homeland security regulations, he hoped that was not our final word on the issu e. Peer reviewer (1) suggest ed that OMB provide guidelines for the analysis of antiterrorism and homeland se curity regulation. Comme nter (E) characterized that lack of monetized benefits for homeland security regulations as OMB giving these regulations a \"free ride.\" OMB encourages DHS and any other agency with a substantial focus on security to develop more systematic ways of judging the effi cacy of their regulations. We disagree with Commenter E's characterization of our treatment of homeland security regulations. As we have mentioned in previous reports, most prominen tly in our 2003 Report where we dedicated a chapter to homeland security regulations, m onetizing the benefits of homeland security regulations requires an estimate of the probability and consequences of a terrorist attack. We recognize this type of analysis of terrorism risk is exceedingly difficult, and would invite comment in future reports on methods and tools to he lp facilitate this analysis. We also note that OMB Circular A-4, Regulatory Analysis, states that \"In unusual cases where no quantified information on benefits, costs and effectiveness can be produced, the regulatory analysis should present a qualitative discussion of the issues and evidence.\" As a result of similar comment in 14 the 2005 Report, we provide a separate table su mmarizing the monetized cost and qualitative benefits for every major ho meland security regulation. Commenters (A, E, F) criticized our treat ment of rules that implemented Federal budgetary programs, including our practice of excl uding rules of this type from the cost and benefit totals. Many of these comments point out that rules designed to spend budget dollars also generate costs and benefits. Costs include the opp ortunity costs of tax revenue, and benefits are derived from the behavioral change s caused by the spending programs. We agree that rules th at transfer Federal budgetary progr ams often have opportunity costs or benefits in addition to the budgetary dollars sp ent. We continue to believe, however, that our approach of separately identifyi ng budgetary rules has merit. OM B feels this Report is properly focused on regulations that impose costs primar ily through private sector mandates, and not those regulations that facilitate Federal budget programs. We do see me rit in providing more information about these rules, and we encourage agencies to use their pr ofessional judgment and to provide this information to the extent that it is available and practicable. Peer reviewer (3) and Commenter (A) also questioned the designation of the Department of Homeland Security's Allocat ion of H-1B Visas Created by the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004 as a budget rule. OMB included this rule as a budgetary rule becaus e the rulemaking itself only established that DHS would collect fees (speci fied in the Visa Reform Act) and allocate the new H-1B cap on a first-in, first- out basis. The rule does not ch ange the limit on the number of H-1B Visas. The provision of the Visa Reform Act expanding the H-1B cap for non-immigrant aliens with an advanced degree from the U.S. was self-implementing 90 days after enactment. Since these fees increase revenues to government , and the rule does not otherwise contain a private sector mandate, we considered this a budget rule. Commenter (A) encourages us to present more detailed information on the costs and benefits of independent agency rulemakings, stating th at the exclusion of independent agency rulemakings causes the report to underestimate the total regulatory burden imposed by the government and therefore causes the report to be incomplete. OMB ag rees that it is important to assess the benefits and costs of independent agency regulatory actions, and we do encourage independent agencies to conduct be nefit-cost analyses that conf orm to our regulatory analysis guidance, and to submit those analyses of majo r rules to OMB. OMB also agrees with the suggestion that providing more information about independent agency estimates would be worthwhile, and will explore feasible ways of doing so in future reports. Two commenters (E and F) cl aim that OMB arbitrarily excludes deregulatory actions from review, and that we have failed to address this criticism in previous reports. OMB disagrees that we arbitrarily ex clude deregulatory actions from re view, and we disagree that we have failed to address this criticism in previous reports. We offered a thorough response to this criticism in both the final 2004 Report (see page 29) and the final 2005 Report (see page 21). Several commenters suggested that we add di scussion on various subjects. Peer reviewer (1) suggested that we include a discussion of the costs and benefits of an ti-trust activiti es in the Report. Commenter (A) suggested that we add discussion of regulations issued directly by Congress. OMB feels that a discussion of the co sts and benefits of an ti-trust activities, and 15 discussion of the costs and benefits of regulat ions issued directly by Congress, are beyond the scope of this Report. Comments on the Overall Quality of Analysis Most commenters suggest that we stress the lim ited nature of the statistics on costs and benefits throughout the Report. Commenter (G) disagreed with th e \"conclusion of the report\" that the benefits of regulation exceed the costs. Several commenters (E, F) stated that the methodology of cost-benefits analysis is so unso und and inherently biased that any attempt to add the results together in an accounting stat ement was inherently misleading. One peer reviewer (1) also suggested that OMB summar ize agency compliance with OMB guidance in order to encourage further standa rdization of agency analysis. OMB agrees that we should emphasize the limitations of aggregating the costs and benefits of different regulations; we continue throughout these Reports to point out the inherent drawbacks of aggregating costs and benefits . We do not believe, however, that agency methodologies are so different that comparison across agencies is useless. For example, almost all agencies report resu lts with a 7 percent discount rate , long required by OMB. Almost all agencies use similar methodologies for valuing fa talities avoided due to health and safety regulations. In addition, where be nefits are primarily due to gains in economic efficiency, the market analysis that leads to an estimate of efficiency gains is fairly standardized. We further note that in limited cases, as e xplained in the draft Report, OMB does adjust agency cost and benefit estimates to help ensure consistency in the context of this annual Report. First, all values were adjusted to 2001 dollars ; next, quantified but non-m onetized estimates were monetized; and finally, estimates of net present values were a nnualized to provide a yearly stream of benefits and costs. Nevertheless, OMB agrees with the goal of further standardization of agency analyses, and believes the best way to promote this is through the application of OMB Circular A-4, which was designed to promote consistent analytical approaches. In addition to the uncertainties introduced by the aggregation of costs and benefits across regulations, some comments disc ussed the inherent uncertainty of regulatory analysis. In particular, commenters (A, E, and F), stated that the Report provides a false pretense of accuracy and objectivity when presenting the costs and be nefits of regulation. Commenter A suggested that reporting numbers to the nearest million do llars means the estimates should be \"correct\" within a range of $1 million dollars, and since these estimates are ce rtainly not precise to within this range, our presentation of estimates dow n to $1 million is inaccurate and inherently misleading. OMB has received several commen ts in the past in a similar vein. OMB disagrees that we provide a false pret ense of accuracy when presenting agency estimates of the costs and benefits of regul ation. We discuss throughout the Report the many sources of uncertainty within individual rule makings and the difficulty and uncertainty of aggregating different estimates of costs and benefits. For EPA rulemakings, which these comments discuss, the draft Report explained that the wide range of benefits estimates for clean air rules on controlling particulates does not capture the full extent of the scientific uncertainty. 16 OMB agrees with Commenter A that the central estimates of impact presented in the report are likely not accurate within a range of $1 million dollars; however, that does not mean that the central estimates of impact should be reported to a significantly fewer number of significant digits. The number of significant digits reflects the precision of an estimate, or the degree to which the estimate can be reproduced us ing the same set of input data. Since most agency impact analyses present estimates with a precision of $1 million, OMB presents estimates to that precision. The accuracy of the estimates, or the degree to which the estimate reflects the actual impact value, is different from precision. The uncertainty ranges pr esented along with the central estimate, however, is the proper way of characterizing accura cy, not presenting the central estimate only to the number of significant digits that refl ect the uncertainty range. Two commenters (E, F) suggest that the use of cost-benefit analysis has a major shortcoming. They state that cost-benefit analysis is inherently biased against regulation because it causes agencies to grossly overestimate the real cost to the economy and systematically underestimate the benefits of regulation. A majo r reason why benefits are underestimated, they state, is that cost-benefit anal ysis de-emphasizes important benefits that are non-quantifiable. Commenter (F) takes issue with what they state is OMB's finding, in our 2005 final report analysis comparing ex-ante and ex-post regulatory impact estimates, that costs are systematically underestimated and benefits are sy stematically overestimated. OMB does not agree that cost-benefit analys is is inherently biased for or against regulation. Estimates are inherently uncertain, and we are aware of retrospective analyses that have found ex-ante costs and benefits to be both under and over estimated.18 In addition, we explain in the Report that thes e major rules have important non- quantified benefits and costs, which may have been a key factor in an agency 's decision to promulgate a rulemaking. Table A- 1 in the Report thoroughly describes the importa nt non-quantified costs and benefits associated with particular rulemakings. The commenter also misstated the conclusions of our 2005 analysis. In the subset of impact estimates we studied, we concluded that ex-ante costs and benefits were both more likely to be overestimated. We did not conclude that ex-ante costs in our sample were systematically underestimated, as the commenter suggested. We al so stated that our sample was necessarily a convenience sample and should be generalized with caution. Several commenters made useful recomme ndations on the presentation of the Report. Peer reviewer (3) pointed out that when co mparing the percent of major, economically significant rules reviewed by OMB that have mone tized costs and benefits with the percent of major independent agency rules that have mone tized costs and benefits, we should have added the two homeland security rulemakings. We agre e, and have added these rulemakings to our 18 For example, Harrington et al (2000), in an analysis of a sample of EPA and OSHA regulatory impact analyses, found that ex-ante per-unit abatement costs were over estimated about as often as und erestimated. They also found that ex-ante total abatement costs were more likely to be overestimated than underestimated. Overestimation of total costs was primarily due to errors in estimating the quantity of benefits achieved by the rule, which suggests that the benefits of these rulemakings were overestimated as well, and to unanticipated technological change. Chapter III in the 2005 final Report discusses this and other retrospective studies of the impact of regulations in more detail. 17 totals in this comparison. Peer reviewer (3) also made a series of suggested clarifying edits in Chapter 1, most of which we adopted. Although OMB did not make an explicit call for nominations for regulatory reform in the 2006 draft report, two commenters (B and C) provi ded comment on or suggestions for reforms. Commenter C reemphasized their 2004 manuf acturing reform nomination to update a DOL/OSHA regulation requiring adherence to Na tional Fire Protecti on Association (NFPA) 1969 fire standards for boat building. We provide an update on the status of this reform in Appendix E. Commenter B provided new sugge stions for the reform of regulations implementing the Davis-Bacon Act and National A pprenticeship Act. OMB wishes to thank the commenters for these comments on specific regulat ory reforms. We have forwarded these comments to DOL for further consideration. In addition to the suggestions covered above, peer reviewer (1) made the suggestion that OMB facilitate the use of information markets to increase overall economic efficiency and to inform regulatory decision making. OMB agrees th at information markets are an interesting new area of research, and we encourage the commenter to keep us apprised of relevant new findings. F. The Impact of Federal Regulation on State, Local, and Tribal Government, Small Business, Wages, and Economic Growth Sec. 624 (a)(2) of the Regulatory Right-to-Know Act calls on OMB to present an analysis of the impacts of Federal regulation on State, local, and tribal governments, small business, wages, and economic growth. Impacts on State, Local, and Tribal Governments Over the past 10 years, six rules have impos ed costs of more than $100 million per year (adjusted for inflation) on State, local, and tribal governments (and thus have been classified as public sector mandates under the Un funded Mandates Act of 1995).19 EPA's Rule on Standards of Performan ce for Municipal Waste Combustors and Emissions Guidelines (1995): This rule set standards of performance for new municipal waste combustor (MWC) units and emission guidelines for existing MWCs under sections 111 and 129 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429]. The standards and guidelines apply to MWC units at plants with combustion capacities greater than 35 mega grams per day (Mg/da y) (approximately 40 tons per day) of municipal solid waste (MSW). The EPA st andards require sources to achieve the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of air pollutants that the Administrator 19We note that EPA's proposed rules setting air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter may ultimately lead to expenditures by State, local, or tribal governments of $100 million or more. However, Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act provides that agency statements of compliance with Section 202 must be conducted \"unless otherwise prohibited by law\". The conference report to this legislation indicates that this language means that the section \"does not require the preparation of any estimate or analysis if the agency is prohibited by law from considering the estimate or analysis in adopting the rule.\" EPA has stated, and the courts have affirmed, that under the Clean Air Act, the primary air quality standards are health-based and EPA is not to consider costs. 18 determined is achievable, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emissions reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements. EPA estimated the annualized costs of the em issions standards and guidelines to be $320 million per year (in constant 1990 dollars ) over existing regulations. While EPA estimated the cost of such standards for new sources to be $43 million per year, the cost to existing sources was estimated to be $277 million per year. The annual emissions reductions achieved through this regulatory action include, for example, 21,000 Mg. of sulfur dioxide; 2,800 Mg. of particulate matte r (PM); 19,200 Mg of nitrogen oxides; 54 Mg. of mercury; and 41 Kg. of dioxins/furans. EPA's Standards of Performance for New Sta tionary Sources and Guidelines for Control of Existing Sources: Municipal Solid Waste Landfills (1996): This rule set performance standards for new municipal solid waste la ndfills and emission guidelines for existing municipal solid waste landfills under section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The rule addressed non-methane organic compounds (NMOC) and methane emissions. NMOC include volatile organic compounds (VOC), hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), and odorous compounds. Of the landfills required to install controls, about 30 percent of the existing landfills and 20 percent of the new landfills are privately owned. The remaining landfills are publicly owned. Th e total annualized costs for co llection and control of air emissions from new and existing MSW landfills are estimated to be $100 million. EPA's National Primary Drinking Water Re gulations: Disinfect ants and Disinfection Byproducts (1998): This rule promulgates maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs) and enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for about a dozen disinfectants and byproduc ts that result from the interact ion of these disinfectants with organic compounds in drinking water. The rule will require additional treatment at about 14,000 of the estimated 75,000 covered water system s nationwide. The costs of the rule are estimated at $700 million annually. The quantified benefits estimates range from zero to 9,300 avoided bladder cancer cases annually, with an estimated monetized value of $0 to $4 billion per year. Possible reductions in rectal and colon cancer and adverse reproductive and developmental effects were not quantified. EPA's National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment (1998): This rule estab lishes new treatment and monitoring requirements (primarily related to filtratio n) for drinking water systems th at use surface water as their source and serve more than 10,000 people. The purpose of the rule is to enhance health protection against potentially harmful microbial contaminants. EPA estimated that the rule will impose total annual costs of $300 millio n per year. The rule is expected to require treatment changes at about half of the 1,400 large surface water systems, at an annual cost of $190 million. Monitoring re quirements add $96 million per year in additional costs. All systems will also have to perform enhanced monitoring of filter performance. The estimated benefits include average reductions of 110,000 to 338,000 cases of cryptosporidiosis annually, with an estimated monetized value of $0.5 to $1.5 billion, and possible reductions in the in cidence of other waterborne diseases. 19 EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Eliminati on: System B Regulations for Revision of the Water Pollution Control Program Addressing Storm Water Discharges (1999): This rule expands the existing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program for storm water control. It covers smaller m unicipal storm sewer systems and construction sites that disturb one to five acres. The rule allows for th e exclusion of certain sources from the program based on a demonstration of the lack of impact on water quality. EPA estimates that the total cost of the rule on Federal and Stat e levels of government, and on the private sector, is $803.1 million annually. EPA considered alternatives to the rule, including the option of not re gulating, but found that the rule was the option that was \"most cost effective or least burdensome, but also protective of the water quality.\" EPA's National Primary Drinking Water Regulations; Arsenic and Clarifications to Compliance and New Source Contaminants Monitoring (2001): This rule reduces the amount of arsenic that is allowed to be in drinking water from 50 ppb to 10 ppb. It also revises current monitoring requirements a nd requires non-trans ient, non-community water systems to come into compliance with the standard. This rule may affect either State, local or tribal governmen ts or the private sector at an approximate annualized cost of $206 million. The monetized benefits of the rule range from $140 to $198 million per year. The EPA selected a standard of 10 ppb b ecause it determined that this was the level that best maximizes health risk reduction benefits at a cost th at is justified by the benefits, as required by the Safe Drinking Water Act. Although these six EPA rules were the only ones over the past 10 years to require expenditures by State, local and tribal govern ments exceeding $100 million, they were not the only rules with impacts on other levels of gove rnments. For example, 14 percent of the regulations listed in the Apr il 2001 Unified Regulatory Agenda i ndicated some impact on State governments. The percentage of rules with such impacts on local and tribal governments was nine and six, respectively. Impact on Small Business The need to be sensitive to the impact of regulations and paperwork on small business was recognized in Executive Order 12866. The Execu tive Order calls on the agencies to tailor their regulations by business size in order to im pose the least burden on so ciety, consistent with obtaining the regulatory objectives. It also calls for the development of short forms and other efficient regulatory approaches for small businesse s and other entities. Moreover, in the findings section of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), Congress stated that \"... small businesses bear a disproportionate share of regulatory costs and burdens\" (Section 202(2) of Pub. L. No. 104-121). Each firm has to determine whether a regulation applies, how to comply, and whether it is in compliance. As firms increase in size, fixed costs of regulatory compliance are spread over a larger revenue and employee base, which often results in lower regulatory costs per unit of output. The Office of the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (hereafter \"Advocacy\") recently sponsored a stu dy (Crain 2005) that estimated the burden of 20 regulation on small businesses.20 This is the third in a series of studies on small business regulation conducted on behalf of the Office of Advocacy.21 This study found that regulatory costs per employee decline as firm size\u2014as m easured by the number of employees per firm\u2014 increases. Crain estimates that the total cost of Federal regulation (envi ronmental, workplace, economic, and tax compliance regulation) was 45 percent greater per employee for firms with under 20 employees compared to firms with over 500 employees. Because of this relatively large impact of regulations on small businesses, President Bush issued Executive Order 13272 of August 13, 2002, which reiterates the need for agencies to assess the impact of regulations on small busines ses under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 601-612). Under the RFA, whenever an agency comes to the conclusion that a particular regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the agency must conduct both an initial and fina l regulatory flexibili ty analysis. This analysis must include an assessment of the likel y burden of the rule on small entities, and an analysis of alternatives that may afford reli ef to small entities while still accomplishing the regulatory goals. Advocacy reports annually on the overall perf ormance of agency compliance with the RFA and Executive Order 13272, and Advocacy effo rts to improve the analysis of small business impacts and to persuade agencies to afford relief to small businesses.22 The 2005 comprehensive report contains four main sections . Section one provides a brief overview of the RFA, as amended by SBREFA. Section two provid es a summary of agency compliance with the RFA and E.O. 13272 for FY 2005. Section three deta ils Advocacy's role in reviewing particular rulemakings during FY 2005. Section four pr ovides a summary of Advocacy's activities encouraging States to adopt Small Business Regula tory Flexibility Model Legislation.

Impact on Wages The impact of Federal regulations on wages depends upon how \"wages\" are defined and on the types of regulations involve d. If we define \"wages\" narro wly as workers' take-home pay, social regulation usually decr eases average wage rates, wh ile economic regulation often increases them, especially for specific groups of wo rkers. If we define \"wages\" more broadly as the real value or utility of workers' income, the directions of the effects of the two types of regulation can sometimes be reversed. 1. Social Regulation Social regulation\u2014defined as rules designed to improve health, safety, and the 20Crain, W.M. 2001. \"The Impact of Regulatory Costs on Small Firms.\" Report prepared for the Office of Advocacy, U.S. Small Business Ad ministration.

Compliance costs, however, must be paid for by some combination of workers, business owners, and/or consumers through adjustments in wages, profits , and/or prices. This effect is most clearly recognized for occupational health and safety standards. As one leading textbook in labor economics suggests: \"Thus, whether in the form of smaller wage increases, more difficult working conditions, or inability to obtain or retain one's first choi ce in a job, the costs of compliance with health standards will fall on employees.\"23 In the occupational health standards case, wher e the benefits of regulation accrue mostly to workers, workers are likely to be better off if health benefits exceed compliance costs and such costs are not borne primarily by workers.24 Although wages may reflect the cost of compliance with health and safety rules, the job safety and other benefits of such regulation can compensate for the monetary loss. Workers, as consumers benefiting from safer products and a cleaner environment, may also come out ahead if regulation produces signif icant net benefits for society. 2. Economic Regulation For economic regulation, defined as rules designe d to set prices or conditions of entry for specific sectors, the effects on wages may be positive or negative. Economic regulation can result in increases in income (narrowly define d) for workers in the industries targeted by the regulation, but decreases in broader measures of income based on utility or overall welfare, especially for workers in genera l. Economic regulation is often used to protect industries and their workers from competition. These wage gains come at a cost in inefficiency from reduced competition, a cost which consumers must bear. Workers wages do not go as far when prices for goods that are inefficiently produ ced are relatively higher. More over, growth in real wages, which are limited generally by productivity incr eases, will not grow as fast without the stimulation of outside competition.25 These statements are generalizations of the im pact of regulation in the aggregate or by broad categories. Specific regulations can increa se or decrease the over all level of benefits accruing to workers depending upon the actual ci rcumstances and whether net benefits are produced. Economic Growth and Related Macroeconomic Indicators The strongest evidence of th e impact of smart regulation on economic growth is the differences in per capita income growth and other indicators of well being experienced by countries under different regulatory systems. A well-known example is the comparison of the growth experience of the present and former Communist state-controlled economies with the 23From Ehrenberg, R. and R. Smith 1991 . Modern Labor Economics , 4th Edition. HarperCollins, p. 279. 24Based on a cost benefit analysis of OSHA's 1972 Asbe stos regulation by Settle (1975), which found large net benefits, Ehrenberg and Smith cite this regulation as a case where workers' wages were reduced, but they were made better off because of improved health (p. 281). 25Winston (1998) estimates that real operating costs declined 25 to 75 percent in the sectors that were deregulated over the last 20 years\u2014transportation, energy, and telecommunications. See Winston, C. (1998), \"U.S. Industry Adjustment to Economic Deregulation\", Journal of Economic Perspectives 12(3): 89-110. 22 more market-oriented economies of the West and Pacific Rim. State-controlled economies may initially have had growth advantages because of their emphasis on investment in capital and infrastructure but, as technology became more complex and innova tion a more important driver of growth, the state-directed economies fell behind the more dynamic and flexible market- oriented economies. Less well known are the si gnificant differences in growth rates and indicators of well being, perhaps for the same reasons, seen among economies with smaller differences in the degree of government control and the quality of regulation.26 Several groups of researchers have devel oped indicators of economic freedom to rank countries and compare their economic performan ce. Since 1995, the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal have published jointly a yearly index of economic freedom for 161 countries. They find a very strong relations hip between the index and per capita GDP.27 The index, based mostly on subjective assessments by in-house experts, is composed of 50 independent variables divided into 10 broad factors that attempt to measure different aspects of economic freedom: trade policy, fiscal burden, govern ment intervention, property rights, banking and finance, wages and prices, regulation, and informal market activity. A correlation between degrees of economic freedom and per capita GDP does not prove that economic freedom causes economic growth. Economic growth could cause economic freedom or both could be correlated with an unknown third factor. Mo re suggestive is the data on ch anges in these indicators. The authors examine the relationship between the change in the index sin ce 1995 and the average GDP growth rate over seven years. After grouping the 142 countries (for which they had complete data) into quintiles, they find a very strong association betw een improvement in the index and growth rates. The fi rst quintile of countries grew at a rate of 4.9 percent per year, almost twice the 2.5 percent growth rate of the fifth quintile. Since 1997, the Fraser Institute of Vancouver, B.C. has published the Economic Freedom of the World index for 123 countries.28 The rank of the top ten economies is Hong Kong (1), Singapore (2), New Zealand, Switzerland, the Un ited Kingdom, and the United States (3), Australia and Canada (7), and Ireland and L uxembourg (9). The index, which is based on 38 variables, many of them from surveys publishe d by other institutions, measures five major concepts: size of government, legal structure a nd security of property rights, access to sound money, freedom of exchange with foreigners, and regulation of credit, labor, and business. The latest report finds that the inde x is highly correlated not just with per capita income and economic growth, but with other measures of well being, including life expectancy, the income level of the poorest 10 percent, adult literacy, corruption-free governance, civil liberties, the United Nations' Human Development Index, infant surv ival rates, and the absence of child labor. Economic growth does not appear to come at the expense of these other measures of well being. This is reassuring because GDP and other econo mic measures do not capture all the costs and benefits produced by regulation. 26A new discipline has developed to examine these differences. See S. Djankov, E. Glaes er, R. La Porta, F. Lopez- de-Salinas, and A. Shleifer, \"T he New Comparative Economics,\" Journal of Comparative Economics (December, 2003) Vol. 31.4, pp. 595-619. 27Marc A. Miles, Edwin J. ry Anastasia O'Grady, and Ana I. Eiras, 2004 Index of Economic Freedom. (Heritage Foundation/Wall Stet Journal). 28James Gwartney and Robert Lawson, Economic Freedom of the World: 2004 Annual Report . Fraser Institute, Vancouver, BC. 23 Although these statistical associations provide broad support for the claim that excessive and poorly designed regulation reduces economic grow th and other indicators of well being, they have several drawbacks. First, the data are based largely on subjective assessments and survey results. In addition, they in clude non-regulatory indicators as well as indicators of direct regulatory interventions, such as measures of fiscal burden and soundness of monetary policy. In an attempt to provide less subjective m easures of regulatory quality, the World Bank recently began a multi-year project to catalogue international differences in the scope and manner of regulations based on objective measures of regulatory burden - su ch as the number of procedures required to register a new business and the time and costs of registering a new business, enforce a contract, or go through bankruptcy. The first volume ( Doing Business in 2004, Understanding Regulation) of the annual series examin es for 130 countries five fundamental aspects of a firm's life cycle: starting a business, hiring and firing workers, enforcing contracts, obtaining credit, and closing a business.29 The second volume (Doing Business in 2005, Removing Obstacles to Growth) updates these measures and adds data about registering property a nd protecting investors.30 The third volume ( Doing Business in 2006, Creating Jobs ) updates the previous measures, expands th e number of countries to 155, and adds three more sets of indicators: dealing with licenses, paying taxes, and trading across borders. 31 The first volume contained three major conclusions: Regulation varies wide ly around the world; Heavier regulation of business activity gene rally brings bad outc omes, while clearly defined and well-protec ted property rights enha nce prosperity; and Rich countries regulate business in a cons istent manner. Poor countries do not. The second volume added three more main findings: Businesses in poor countries face much larger regulatory burdens than those in rich countries. Heavy regulation and weak property right s exclude the poor from doing business. The payoffs from reform appear large. The third volume added a new conclusion that be tter performance on the ease of doing business is associated with more jobs. The World Bank also finds that rich countries regulate less in all respects covered in the report and that common law and Nordic countri es regulate less than countries whose legal systems are based on socialist principles. Th e top ten countries ranked on the ease of doing business based on the ten indicators are in or der: New Zealand, Singapore, the United States, Canada, Norway, Australia, Hong Kong (China ), Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Japan.32 29World Bank. Doing Business in 2004: Understanding Regulation . Oxford Press. Washington, DC. 30World Bank. Doing Business in 2005: Removing Obstacles to Growth . Oxford Press. Washington, DC. 31Word Bank. Doing Business in 2006: Creating Jobs . Washington, DC. 32See Doing Business in 2006 , p. 3. There is a high degree of association between this ranking, which is based on objective measures, and the ranking from the Gwartney and Lawson study, which was based on subjective assessments. 24 Like the studies based on broader and more subjective indicators , the World Bank study finds that both labor productivity and employment are positively correlated with less regulation. The World Bank study also finds that heavier regulation is associated with grea ter inefficiency of public institutions and more corru ption. The result is that regulat ion often has a perverse effect on the people it is meant to protect. Overly stringent regulation of business creates strong incentives for businesses to opera te in the underground or informal economy. The study cites the example of Bolivia, one of th e most heavily regulated econo mies in the world, where an estimated 82 percent of business activity takes place in the info rmal sector. The study also found that women's share of private sector employment was also correlated with less rigid regulation of labor markets. Third, the study finds that rich countries te nd to regulate consiste ntly across the five indicators, as measured by the st atistical significance of their 15 cross correlations compared to the cross correlations of poor countries. The Worl d Bank suggests that poor countries have made some progress in some reform areas but not othe rs and that this finding suggests some optimism that these reforms may spread. The study estima tes that if the countri es in the bottom three quartiles were able to move up to the top quartile in the \"doing business\" indicator rankings, they would be able to realize a 2 percen t increase in annual economic growth. Based on its analysis of the impact of regulation on economic performance, the World Bank concludes that countries that have perfor med well have five common elements to their approach to regulation: 1. Simplify and deregulate in competitive markets. 2. Focus on enhancing property rights. 3. Expand the use of technology. 4. Reduce court involvement in business matters. 5. Make reform a continuous process. It is interesting to note that these principles correspond fairly closely to the principles of regulatory reform that the U.S. has a ttempted to follow over the last 25 years.33 The strong relationship between excess regula tion and economic performance persists even when the sample of countries is confined to the 30 mostly high-income democracies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and De velopment (OECD). The OECD also has underway major work on this subject. A recen t report by Giuseppe Nico letti summarizes the findings of the OECD work as follows: \"The empirical results suggest that regulatory reforms have positive effects not only in 33For a description of the United States' regulatory reform program, see Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, (February 17, 1981), Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, (September 30, 1993) and Chapter 1 of Stimulating Smarter Regulation:2002 Report to Congress on the Costs and Benefits of Regulations and Unfunded Mandates on State, Local, and Tribal Entities .

Those countries also tended to show both the largest increase in the number of new small and medium-sized firms and in the rate of investment in research and de velopment in manufacturing. These factors are thought to be important in increasing the growth rate of productivity a nd per capita income. The major efforts to determine the effect of regulatory policies on economic performance described all use quite different indicators of regulatory quality and include different types of regulation, yet reach very similar conclusions. Nicoletti and Pryor examined three different indices of regulation, one obj ectively estimated and two ba sed on subjective surveys of businessmen; one that just examined product ma rkets, one that examined product and labor markets and one that includes financial and environmental regulations. The paper found statistically significant correlati ons among the three indices despite the differences in coverage and methodologies.36 A second group of researchers, who have done work for the World Bank, also finds a strong correlation be tween regulation of en try into markets an d the regulation of labor. They attribute this to their finding that the legal origin of regulation explains regulatory style. As they put it ... \"countri es have regulatory styles that are pervasiv e across activities and shaped by the origin of their laws.\"37 Thus, countries with good records on entry regulation (which they point out includes some environmental regulation) also have good records on labor regulation.38 A more recent body of literature, which combin es the data sets of regulatory indicators discussed above as well as others, provides ad ditional support to the supposition that excess regulation tends to reduce grow th. Several papers by Loayza, Ovieda, and Serven use instrumental variable techniques to isolate the exogenous variation in regulation and determine the causal impact of regulation on economic grow th, thereby reducing the reverse causality problem discussed above.39 These studies also find that wh en the quality of regulation as measured by indicators of better governance (such as democratic accountability and absence of 34Giuseppe Nicoletti, \"The Economy-Wide Effects of Product Market Reform \". (OECD. Paris, December 2003). Also see Nicoletti and Stefano Scarpetta, \"Regulation, Productivity, and Growth: OECD Evidence,\" Research Paper 2944 (January 2003). 35See Giuseppe Nicoletti and Frederic Pryor, \"Subjective and Objective Measures of the Extent of Government Regulation,\" Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization (forthcoming), Table 3. 36Ibid. 37Juan Botero, Simeon Shleifer, \"The Regulation of Quarterly Journal Of Economics (2004). 38Ibid. 39Norma Loayza, Maria Oveiodo, Luis Seven, \"Re gulation Macroeconmic Performance,\" World Bank Policy Research Paper No. 3469 (2005) and Norma Loayza, Ana Maria Oveiodo, Luis Seven. \"The Impact of Regulation on Growth and Informal ity: Cross-Country Evidence\" AEI-Brookings Joint Center (May 2005). 26 corruption) increases, the regulator y burden effect is smaller. These studies also find that both the volatility of economic growth and the size of the informal sector increase with regulation. This pattern of findings pr ovides strong support for policie s that pursue \"Smarter\" or \"Better\" regulation40\u2014whether the country is a high-inco me OECD country or a developing country. The results are also c onsistent with economic theory, which predicts that economic growth is enhanced by regulatory policies that promote competitive markets, secure property rights, and intervene to correct market failu res rather than to increase state influence.41 The World Bank measures of regulation, in particular, are weighted toward economic policy, although the recent inclus ion of licensing requirements in Doing Business 2006 reduces that tendency. The ease of getting construction permits, which are mainly justified as safety measures, is used as the regulat ory indicator. It is important to point out that these findings likely hold for social as well as economic regulation.42 Both types of regulation, if poorly designed, harm economic growth as well as the social benefits that follow from economic growth. Our regulatory analysis guidelines (OMB Circular A-4) have a presumption against price and entry controls in competitive markets and thus deregulation is often appropriate.43 For social regulation, Circular A-4 re quires an analysis of the costs and benefits of regulations and their alternatives. In this case, smarter regula tion may cause rules that are more stringent, less stringent, or just better designed to be more cost-effective. Re gulation that utilizes performance standards rather than design standards or uses market-oriented approaches rather than direct controls is often more cost-effective because it enlists competitive pressures for social purposes. Social regulation often clarifies or defines property rights so that ma rket efficiency is enhanced. Regulation that is based on solid economic analysis and sound science is also more likely to provide greater benefits to society at less cost than regul ation that is not.44 Thus a smarter or better regulation program relies on sound analysis and utilizes competition to improve economic growth and individual well-being in similar ways for both economic and social regulation. It is not surprising that countries that do well with one type of regulation tend to do well with the other. Nevertheless, more research is needed to determine how different types of regulation (e.g., economic versus social rules or product mark et versus labor market regulations) influence 40The U.S. uses the term \"Smarter Re gulation\" and the UK, Canada, Ireland and the EU all use the term \"Better Regulation\" to describe their reform programs. 41See S. Djankov, E. Glaeser, R. La Porta, F. Lopez-de-Salinas, and A. Shleifer, \"The New Comparative Economics,\" Journal of Comparative Economics (December, 2003) Vol. 31.4, pp. 595-619. 42Note that there is no bright line between economic and social regulation. Social regulation often establishes entry barriers and protects the status quo through the use of stringent requirements for new plants, products, or labor. Perhaps for this reason res earchers our now using the term product market and labor market regulation to describe the different types of regulation. 43Although many of the rules reviewed by OMB are social regulation, OMB also reviews many economic regulations and many social regulations have economic co mponents. For example, OMB recently reviewed a series of rules that deregulated the computer reservation system us ed by travel agents and airlines due to changes in the market structure and technology. OMB also reviews labor, housing, pension, agricultural, energy, and some financial regulations, which also may be viewed as economic regulation. 44The benefits of such a regulatory program will not show up just as an increase in measured GDP but will also show up as improvements in health, safety, and the environment. First, the regulations are designed to provide such public goods in the most cost-effective way, and second, the higher economic growth provided by a well-run regulatory reform program will increase the demand for, and the ability of the economy to supply, such public goods. 27 economic growth and well being. G. Response to Peer Reviews and Public Comments on Economic Growth and Related Macroeconomic Indicators In contrast to last year's Re port, OMB received relatively li ttle comment on this section. Similar to last year's Report, commenter (E) stated that our discussion of the impact of regulations on growth was misleading and \"anti-re gulatory\" and that we concluded that social regulation was harmful to growth. Commenter (F ) states that this section poses a false and misleading trade-off between corporate competitiv eness and protection of the public. It was our intent to emphasize that these findings implied th at economic growth is enhanced by \"smarter\" or \"better\" regulation that relie s on competition, when appropriate, a nd careful analysis to design cost-effective regulation when that is appropriate. We have tried to clarify that regulatory reform to enhance growth and social welfare includes improving the quality (including sometimes the amount) of regulation. 28 CHAPTER II: TRENDS IN BENEFIT AND COST ESTIMATES Since OMB began to compile records in 1981 until the end of 2005, Federal agencies have published 118,375 final rules in the Federal Register . Of these final rules, 20,928 were reviewed by OMB under Executive Order proce dures. Of these OMB-reviewed rules, 1,164 were considered \"major\" rules, primarily due to their anticipated im pact on the economy (e.g., estimated costs and/or benefits were in ex cess of $100 million annually). As discussed in Chapter I, many major rules implement budgetary programs and involve transfers from taxpayers to program beneficiaries. Since 1981, OMB has reviewed 249 major rules with estimated costs and/or benefits to the private sector or State and local governments of over $100 million annually. Last year's Report presented estimates of the overall cost s of major rules issued by Federal agencies from 1981 to 2004. The estimates are based on the ex ante cost estimates found in agency regulatory impact analyses review ed by OMB under EO 12291 prior to September 1993 and EO 12866 since then. The Report pointed out some of the concerns we had with these estimates, including that, because they are prospectiv e, they might not present an accurate picture of these regulations' actual impacts. Chapter III of last year's Report surveys what we know about the validation of ex ante estimates of costs and benefits of Federal regulation by ex post studies. The best measure of the overall value of regul ation is net benefits; that is, benefits to society minus costs to society. Below we presen t cost and benefit measures for the years 1992 to 2005 for 124 rules, for which reasonably complete monetized estimates of both costs and benefits are available. In a ddition, we extend the cost estimat es back to 1981, the beginning of the regulatory review program at OMB, and include regulations with cost but not benefit estimates.45 In exploring the impact of rulemaking on the economy in the early 1980's, we found that several important de-regulatory ac tions resulted in a net decrease in compliance costs in the first two years of the Reagan Admini stration. We include the net co st savings generated by these regulations as \"negative costs\" for those years. To be consistent, we have also modified our estimates for later years to include regulatory actions that reduced net costs. In 2004, DOT issued two regulations that resulted in net co st savings: one rule reduced minimum vertical separation for airspace and the second increased competition in the computer reservation system for airline travel. In addition, OSHA's ergonomics rule issued November 14, 2000 but repealed by Senate Joint Resolution No. 6 passed by Congr ess and signed by the President in March 2001 (Pub. L. No. 107-5) is recorded as a $4.8 billion cost additio n in 2000 and a $4.8 billion cost savings in 2001. This approach is consistent wi th treatment for earlier years. Another important change is the inclusion of DOT' s 1993 air bag rule, which had been left out of our calculations in 1993 because Congress had mandated the rule.46 We made this change to be consistent with 45To present cost and benefit estimates by year, we generally used agency estimates of central tendency when available and took midpoints when not available. OMB does not have benefits estimates for years prior to 1992. 46Our estimate of $4 billion in annual benefits and $3 billion in annual co sts reflects the assumption that without the rule, 50 percent of the costs and benefits of airbags would have been provided by the market. 29 OMB Circular A-4, Regulatory Analysis, issued in September 2003. The Circular states that in situations where a rule simply restates statutory requirements, incremental costs and benefits should be measured relative to the pre-statute baseline. Finally, EPA adopted significantly more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone a nd fine particulate matter (PM) in 1997. At that time, EPA estimated that the actions necessary to meet th e revised standards woul d yield benefits ranging from $20 to $120 billion per year and would impose costs of $10 to $22 billion per year. In the five years following the promulgation of th e 1997 ozone and fine PM NAAQS, EPA adopted several key rules that will achieve emission re ductions and impose costs that account for a major portion of the benefit and cost estimates associat ed with the NAAQS rules. Thus, to prevent double-counting, we noted in our 2002 Report th at in developing aggregate estimates of regulatory benefits and costs we had decided to exclude the estimates for the 1997 revisions of the ozone and fine PM NAAQS and use instead the estimates associated with the several \"implementing\" rules promulgated in subsequent years. Although the pattern of benefits and costs of the rules presented below is affected by the decision to focus on the implementing rules, we believe these cost and benef it estimates provide a better meas ure of the actual impacts and timing of those impacts. Figure 2-1 presents the cost estimate s from January 20, 1981 through September 30, 2005. Over the last 25 years, $123 billion of annual regu latory costs (2001 dollars) have been added by the major regulations issued by the Exec utive Branch agencies and reviewed by OMB. This means that, on average, almost $5 billion in annual costs have been added each year over this period. Several patterns are present. Note, in particular, th e tendency for regulatory costs to be highest in the last year before a Presid ent leaves office (1988, 1992, and 2000). Note also that, while we have not yet reached the final ye ar of this Administra tion, to date the annual average increase in regulatory cost s in this Administration is lo wer than in any of the three previous Administrations. While the comparison will not be complete until data from 2008 are included, OMB can report that the average annual costs of the regulations issued during this Administration were 54 percent lower than the av erage annual costs of the regulations issued during the previous 20 years, a nd 64 percent lower than those i ssued during the previous eight years. 30 Figure 2-1: Costs of Major Rules (1981-2005) -505101520 1981 19821983 1984 1985 198619871988 1989 1990 1991 1992 19931994 1995 1996 1997 19981999 2000 2001 2002 2003 20042005YearCosts (billions of 2001 dollars) Figure 2-2 shows the costs and benefits of major rules i ssued from October 1, 1992, to September 30, 2005. Benefit estimates for the rules (with two noted exceptions)47 that comprise the overall estimates are presented in various tabl es in the eight annual Reports (including this Report) that OMB has completed. Note that the three highest years for benefits, 1992, 2004, and 2005 are mostly explained by three EPA regulations: the 1992 acid rain permits regulation and the 2004 non-road diesel engine rule, and the 2005 interstate air quality rule . Since more major rules had cost estimates than benefit estimates, it is likely that benefit estimates are understated relative to the cost estimates included in Figure 2-2. The figure also shows that, during its first 56 months in office, this Administration has issued regulations w ith average yearly benefits 112 percent greater than the average annual benefits of the rules issued during the previous eight years. 47The two exceptions, as discussed above, are NHTSA's 1993 airbag rule and OSHA's 2000 ergonomics rule. We did not include benefit estimates for the ergonomics rule because of the speculative nature of the estimates and the difficulty of determining the cause and/or mitigation of the great majority of ergonomic injuries. After the rule was overturned under provisions of the Congressional Review Act, the number of muscular skeletal disorders (MSDs) declined significantly more than OSHA's RIA predicted would occur under the standard. The RIA estimated that MSDs would decline from 647,344 to 517,344 after 10 years of compliance. Instead, three years after the standard (which had never gone into effect) had been overturned, MSDs declined to 435,180 in 2003 (the last year for which data is available). The reason that voluntary actions to reduce MSDs are effective may be that employers and employees alike have strong incentives , due to worker's compensation costs and lost productivity, to reduce the incidence of MSDs. 31 Figure 2-2: Costs and Benefi ts of Major Rules (1992-2005) -$10$0$10$20$30$40$50$60$70$80$90 1992 1993 19941995 1996 1997 1998 19992000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 YearBillions of 2001 dollars Costs Benefits The difference between cost and benefits s hows the net benefits of major regulations from 1992 though September 2005.

Figure 2-2 also shows that in no year were costs significantly greater than benefits, even though benefits are likely unde rstated relative to the cost estimates since some rules had estimated costs but not estimated benefits.48 Figure 2-2 also shows that this Administration issued regulations with net benef its over its first 56 months at a yearly average rate that is 280 percent greater than the rate of net benefits produced by the regulations issued during the previous Administration. However, we wish to emphasize that (1) these are ex ante estimates, (2) as discussed in other sections of this Repor t (see Appendices A and B) as well as previous Reports, the aggregate estimates of costs and benefits deri ved from different agency's estimates and over different time periods are subj ect to methodological inconsistencies and differing assumptions, and (3) the groundwork for the regulations issued by one administration are often begun in a previous administration.49 48In 1993 and 1995, costs exceeded benefits by about $400 million in each year. 49For example, FDA's trans fat rule was proposed by the previous Administration and issued by the Bush Administration while the groundwork for EPA's 2004 non-road diesel engine rule was set by the NAAQS rules issued in 1997. Moreover, Congress and the Judiciary also play a role in the timing and outcomes of regulations. 32 A. Response to Peer Reviews and Public Comments on Trends in Benefit and Cost Estimates One peer reviewer (3)50 expressed concern about compar isons of regulatory performance across presidential administrations. In making th is comment, this peer reviewer noted the absence of a statutory mandate in the Regulat ory Right-to-Know Act that OMB make these comparisons, as well as several methodological problems with OMB's approach. First, the commenter questioned why OMB included the co sts of OSHA's ergonomics rule but not its benefits, which was a concern raised by peer reviewers of last year's Report. As we discussed in the 2005 Report, the ergonomics rule was overtur ned in 2001 when Congress\u2014for the first and only time\u2014used a provision of the Congressional Re view Act. Moreover, we explained that the benefits that OSHA predicted would occur in ten years as a result of the regulation were exceeded without the regulation by over 50 percent within just three years. The same peer reviewer also asked that, given the noted pattern of relatively high regulatory costs in the final year of a presid ency, OMB acknowledge that comparisons between the current Administration and others is incomple te, since we have not reached its final year. While we have emphasized that these are ex ante estimates, we have acknowledged the specific issue raised by the peer reviewer. Finally, the peer reviewer argued that comp aring average annual co sts and benefits of regulations issued during this Administration wi th previous years is misleading, since other metrics could lead to different conclusions re garding the relative performance of different administrations. The peer reviewer suggested metrics such as total net benefits of regulations or the number of regulations with either net be nefits or net costs promulgated by different administrations. OMB would note that Figure 2-2 provides both the costs a nd benefits of major rules issued from October 1, 1992 to Septembe r 30, 2005, and thereby indicates the total net benefits for each year. One public commenter (E) questioned the usef ulness of comparing regulatory costs and benefits in isolation, since co sts must be compared with be nefits to assess regulatory performance. As a general matter, OMB agrees with the commenter. As this commenter acknowledged, Figure 2-2 does provide a comparison of costs and benefits. The commenter did, however, criticize OMB's treatmen t of three rules\u2014EPA's non-road diesel engine and the clean air interstate rules and OSHA's ergonomics rule\u2014as unfairly attri buting regulatory gains to the Bush Administration rather than the Clinton Ad ministration. As OMB emphasized in the draft Report, one Administration may lay the groundwork for regulati ons promulgated by the next Administration. OMB's decision to count the co sts and benefits of the two EPA implementing rules\u2014versus the 1997 rulemaking\u2014was based on our conclusion that they better described the nature and timing of these impacts. OMB's trea tment of the ergonomics rule is consistent with our approach in previous years. Another commenter (F) criticized the compar ison of net benefits across administrations 50See Appendix E for a listing of all th e written comments we have received, an d the numbers or letters we have assigned to their comments. The peer review an d public comments are available for review at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/regpol-reports_congress.html . 33 because (1) they are based on underlying cost bene fit analyses that the commenter previously questioned on methodological grounds and (2) they are political in nature . OMB disagrees with the commenter on both points. OMB has responded\u2014in Chapter I of this report and in previous reports\u2014to both the methodological criticisms of co st benefit analysis offered by the commenter and the acknowledged limitations of cost benefi t analysis and the difficulties inherent in aggregating them. Despite these difficulties, we believe our guidelines ensure that costs and benefits reported by the agencies are not politic al in nature, but rather represent an objective view of the expected impact of regulations. We also believe this information is useful in reporting to Congress on Federal re gulatory performance, and we be lieve there is in terest in how this performance has evolved over time. 34 CHAPTER III: INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN REGULATORY POLICY OMB has been involved in several collabo rative efforts with other countries and international organizations to prom ote regulatory reform and reduce re gulatory barriers to trade. As discussed in Chapter I, research has demons trated a strong relations hip between high quality regulation and economic growth. U.S. efforts to encourage other countries to adopt sound regulatory practices therefore se rve to develop overseas markets for U.S. manufacturers, and ultimately raise living standards for Americans. It is important to note that efforts to facilitate international trade and harmonize regulation are done in a manner that respects na tional sovereignty. As has been noted by the United States Trade Representative (USTR), none of the provisions in the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), or other Free Trade Agreements restricts th e authority of the United States to enact or enforce domestic laws and regulations that protect Americ an businesses, State, local, and tribal governments, consumers, public health and safety, and the environment.51 Rather, all of these agreements call on governments to ensure that the standards that they develop are non- discriminatory, transparent, and not unnecessarily tr ade restrictive. This chapter of the 2006 Report to Congress on the Costs and Benefits of Federal Regulations provides an update on recent developments in internat ional regulatory cooperation. While the U.S. has embarked on several cooper ative initiatives with a number of trading partners, this chapter focuses on the U.S.'s coope ration activities with th e European Union (EU) and with its North American neighbors, Canada and Mexico. Specifica lly, we provide a brief description of sectoral activ ities and horizontal initiatives between the EU and the U.S.52 We also discuss the Security and Prosperity Partners hip of North American, including our joint effort with Canada and Mexico to develop a framework for regulatory cooperation. A. Regulatory Cooperation Between the U.S. and European Union U.S. and EU efforts to increase transatlantic regulatory cooperation are based on a mutual recognition that most remaining transatlantic trade barriers are due primarily to regulatory differences, not to tariffs. The rationale for promoting tran satlantic trade through greater regulatory cooperation is clear. The U.S.-EU bilateral trade and investment relationship is the largest in the world, with approximately 14 million jobs in the U.S. and EU depending on transatlantic commerce.53 Mutual understanding of the central importance of this bilateral trade relationship led to a 2002 agreement on U.S. -EU Guidelines on Regulatory Cooperation and 51See USTR Fact Sheet on State Sovereignty and Trade Agreements, April 14, 2005, available at: http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Document_Library/F act_Sheets/2005/asset_upload_file870_7578.pdf 52For a detailed comparison of the European Commission's guidelines and OMB's guidance to agencies on regulatory impact analysis, see Appendix D. 53European Commission Communication, \"A stronger EU-US Partnership and a more open market for the 21st century,\" COM(2005) 196, May 18, 2005, p. 5. http://europa.eu.int/comm/external_relations/us/revamping/com2005_196_en.pdf 35 Transparency, which set the stage for subsequent initiatives to facilita te transatlantic trade through the easing of regulatory barriers.54 Moreover, the timing for greater transatlanti c regulatory cooperation is good, as there is now strong leadership support in Europe for regulatory reform. The EU's executive authority, the European Commission (the Commission), is pursuing a robus t \"Better Regulation\" agenda under the leadership of Commi ssion President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barro so. A key objective of this agenda is simplifying EU legislation and subj ecting new legislative proposals to impact assessments. The Commission's interest in better regulation was undersco red in June 2005 when the Commission issued updated guidelines on condu cting impact assessments of Commission regulatory proposals.55 The guidelines were revised to ensure that Commission policymakers consider policy options other than \"classical\" forms of regul ation, and they emphasized the principles of subsidiarity (determining whet her EU regulation is more appropriate than regulation by member states) and proportionality (limiting regulation to what is necessary to achieve policy objectives). In announcing th e new guidelines, Presiden t Barroso said, \"This Commission is serious about cutting-red ta pe and reducing unnecessary regulation.\" Commission Vice President G\u00fcnter Verheugen a dded, \"Better impact assessments will bring more coherence and quality and self-restraint to the Commission's work. We want to be able to say what our proposals mean in practice to have a sound basis for policymakers.\"56 Recent U.S.-EU Summits have underscored the strong transatlantic commitment to improving regulatory cooperation between American and Commission authorities. Stakeholders on both sides of the Atlantic ha ve supported these efforts. Most recently, on June 20, 2005, the United States and the Commission issued the 2005 Roadmap for U.S.-EU Regulatory Cooperation and Transparency,57 as part of a broader Initia tive to Enhance Transatlantic Economic Integration and Growth. The 2005 Roadmap builds upon and expands existing U.S.-EU regulatory activities. Specifi cally, the 2005 Roadmap called for the creation of a senior-level dialogue on best regulatory policies and practices; identification of ways to fac ilitate exchanges of U.S. and EU regulatory experts; and expansion of successful sectoral initiatives. The aims of the 2005 Roadmap are to pr omote better quality regulation, minimize regulatory differences, increase consumer confiden ce, and facilitate transatlantic commerce, all 54U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick and Comm erce Secretary Don Evans reached agreement on the guidelines with their EU counterparts on April 12, 2002. The guidelines are available at http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Documen t_Library/Press_Releases/2002/Apr il/asset_upload_file474_2045.pdf 55The EC's Impact 56EC Press Release: \"Better regulation: Commission strengthens June 15, 2005, http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?referen ce=IP/05/733&format=HTML&aged=0&language=en&guiLa nguage=en 57For http://www.ustr.gov/World_Regions/Europe_Middle_East /Europe/U.S._EU_Regulatory_Cooperation/2005_Roadm ap_for_EU-U.S._Regulatory_Coop eration_Transparency.html 36 while respecting the regulatory autonomy of the U.S. and the EU. The Roadmap outlined a range of proposed cooperative initiatives that the United States and the Commission planned to advance in 2005-06, including specific sectoral ac tivities and horizontal in itiatives to address cross-cutting matters. Th ese cooperative initiative s are described below. Sectoral Initiatives The 2005 Roadmap identified 15 sectors in wh ich the U.S. and EU agreed to increase regulatory harmonization. These areas include pharmaceuticals, consumer product safety, nutritional labeling, food safety, chemicals, en ergy efficiency, telecomm unications, and medical devices. Another sector, automobile safety regulation, is the focus of collaboration between the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the EC's Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry (DG Enterp rise), Automobile Unit. The initiative on automobile safety builds on an existing regulatory dialogue between NHTSA and DG Enterprise that was established in June 2003. This dialogue has addressed a number of topics, including regulatory c ooperation on the safety of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and vehicle compatibility. Moving forward, NHTSA and DG Enterprise will develop workplans for these regulatory c ooperation projects. In ad dition, they have agreed to explore other areas of possible cooperation, such as collision mitigation technologies, electron ic stability systems, and international harmoniza tion of dummies used in side-impact vehicle crash tests. Box 3-1 provides background on related efforts by NHTSA and DG Enterprise to pr omote a science- based approach to global te chnical regulations (GTRs) un der the 1998 United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) Global Agreement on Vehicle Regulation. 37 Box 3-1: 1998 Global Agreement on Vehicle Regulation58 The purpose of the 1998 Agre ement is improved safety, environmental pr otection, energy efficiency and anti-theft performance. The Agr eement seeks to ensure that the working parties develop and adopt as GTRs only those regulations whose requirements, test conditions and test pro cedures contribute to achieving those goals. Similarly, the Agreement requires the working groups recommending new GTRs to submit written reports demonstrating that they have considered technical feasibility and economic feasibility; examined benefits, including those of any alternative regulatory requirements and approaches consid ered; and compared potential cost effectiveness of the recommended regulation to that of the alternative re gulatory requirements and approaches considered. The first GTR established under the Agreement demonstrated that U.S./EU regulatory cooperation provides for increased safety and for harmonized standards, which ar e science-based and free of unjustified requirements. If adopted into domestic law by the U.S. and EU, the GTR on door locks and door retention systems would essentially eliminate the differences between the U.S. and EU standards for reducing the likelihood that a vehicle's doors will open in a crash, thus allowing the ejection of the vehicle's occupants. Further, the GTR replaced some existing tests in the U.S. and EU standard s with more effective ones, added some new tests and eliminated some outdated ones. A dopting amendments based on the GTR will not only result in improvements to the U.S. standard, but also to the EU standard. This will also benefit other countries since the EU standard is the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe regulation (ECE R.11), which is used by the majority of the world community. In addition to the sliding door test procedure, the rear-hinged side door requirements, and the inertial test procedure that are discussed above, ECE R. 11, when amended per the GTR, will benefit from the inclusion of back door requirements and rear door locking requirements. Both NHTSA and the European Commission initiated their internal rulemaking pr ocesses to adopt this GTR into law. The establishment of the first GTR also demonstrated that the rulemaking process outlined in the 1998 Agreement works and could be used as an example for other sectors. Other global technical regulations are on the horizon. In the next two years, NHTSA expects to continue working with the European Community and other governments on the establishment of other global regulations in the area of head restraints, motorcycle brakes, and glazing. Horizontal Initiatives In the Annex to the June 2005 Initiative to Enhance Transatlantic Economic Integration and Growth, U.S. and EU leaders agreed to esta blish a senior-level dial ogue on best regulatory policies and practices and identi fy resources and mechanisms for exchanges of U.S. and EU regulatory experts.59 These horizontal, cross-cutting init iatives include gene ral exchanges of information about approaches to regulation in th e U.S. and in the EU and discussion of cross- cutting matters of regulatory practice, incl uding comparisons of how regulatory impact assessments are conducted on both sides of the Atlantic. OMB and Commission officials began this dialogue in Washington, D.C., in September 2005, when OIRA hosted a three-day seminar attended by senior European Commission regulators. The seminar provided an overview of the U.S. regulatory process from the perspective of practitioners in OIRA, Federal regulatory agencies, a nd outside experts. 58The full text of the 9/wp29wgs/wp29gen/wp 29glob/globale.pdf 59http://www.ustr.gov/World_Regions/Europe_Middle_East /Europe/U.S._EU_Regulatory_Cooperation/2005_Road map_for_EU-U.S._Regulatory_Cooperation_Transparency.html 38 The U.S. and the Commission also agreed to launch a Regulatory Cooperation Forum in 2006. The EC hosted the initial event in Brus sels in January 2006, attended by then OIRA Administrator John Graham, that focused on good regulatory practices. A second event held in May 2006 addressed best cooperativ e practices and identified po ssible new areas for regulatory cooperation. B. Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America On March 23, 2005, the leaders of Canada, Me xico, and the U.S. announced the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP). The SPP is a trilateral effort to increase security and enhance prosperity among the th ree countries through improved cooperation and information-sharing. The work is focused on sp ecific bilateral and tr ilateral security and prosperity initiatives involv ing the three governments. The importance of the SPP was emphasized in a September 2006 report to l eaders prepared by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez, and their Canadian and Mexican counterparts: The SPP initiatives form a comprehensive agenda for cooperation among the three countries of North America while respecti ng the sovereignty and unique cultural and legal heritage of each country. Even more im portantly, we believe that the SPP is making an impact in developing a culture of cooperation among three North American neighbors. 60 U.S. participation in the SPP is grounded in f undamental security and economic interests. With respect to the economic rationale fo r increasing North American cooperation, trade statistics clearly demonstrate the extent to wh ich American prosperity is dependent on our economic relationship with Canada and Mexic o. In 2005, Canada had exports to the U.S. amounting to $290.4 billion (83.9 percent of Canada's total exports). Mexi co's exports to the U.S. amounted to $170.1 billion (85. 7 percent of Mexico's total e xports). The U.S. had exports to Canada of $212 billion (23.4 percent of total U.S. exports) in 2005. U.S. exports to Mexico were $120 billion (13.3 percent of the U.S. total). In comparison, in 2005 the U.S. had exports to the 25 EU countries of $186.4 billion. In fact, U.S. two-way trade in goods with Canada and Mexico in 2005 exceeded U.S. two-way trade w ith the 25 members of the European Union and Japan combined.61 Recent SPP Prosperity Activities Following up the leaders' initial March 2005 meeting, in June 2005, Secretaries Gutierrez and Chertoff met their Canadian a nd Mexican counterparts in Ottawa to issue an initial report to the heads of state providing initia l results, key initiatives, and an annex containing the workplans for the many working groups involved. Since then, the three governments have sought input from the private sector. In March 2006, the C ouncil of the Americas and the U.S. Chamber of 60http://www.spp.gov/2006_report_to_leaders /index.asp?dName=2006_report_to_leaders 61U.S. Census Bureau, Foreign Trade Division, \"FT-900: U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services - Annual Revision for 2005,\" available at http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press- Release/2005pr/final_revisions/05final.pdf 39 Commerce convened a private roundtable discu ssion with the Secretary of Commerce, the Canadian Deputy Minister of Industry, and an official from the Mexi can Presidency. The purpose of this meeting was to bring representati ves from the private sector together with the government leaders to discuss the SPP. In March 2006, President Bush met with Pr ime Minister Stephen Harper and President Fox in Cancun, Mexico. They announced five hi gh priority initiatives for the Security and Prosperity Partnership that warranted special at tention in the coming year: the North American Competitiveness Council (NACC), Advancing C ooperation on Avian and Pandemic Influenza, North American Energy Security Initiative, North American Emergency Management, and Smart, Secure Borders. They also announced a large number of bilateral and trilateral accomplishments enhancing economic prosperity and national security. In June 2006, North American business l eaders met in Washington, D.C. to launch officially the NACC. The NACC is a trilatera l group of high level business leaders who will meet annually with the SPP Prosperity and Secu rity ministers to provide recommendations and priorities on promoting North American competitiveness globally. Regulatory Cooperation Framework In addition to regulatory-rela ted initiatives contained in the workplans, one of the SPP initiatives commits the three countries to develop a trilateral Regulatory Cooperation Framework by 2007.62 The three governments are currently work ing together on this important initiative. The goal of the framework is to support and en hance existing cooperation as well as encourage new cooperation among regulators, including at the out set of the regulatory pr ocess. It will also encourage the compatibility of regulations and the reduction of redundant testing and certification requirements, while ma intaining high standards of hea lth and safety. At the last leaders' meeting, the two Presidents and the Prime Minister emphasized that: We are convinced that regulatory coop eration advances the productivity and competitiveness of our nations and helps to pr otect our health, safety and environment. For instance, cooperation on food safety will he lp protect the public while at the same time facilitate the flow of goods. We affirm our commitment to strengthen regulatory cooperation in this and other key sectors a nd to have our central regulatory agencies complete a trilateral regulato ry cooperation framework by 2007.63 Officials from the three governments have b een working together since December 2005 to draft a Framework. This work included a seminar on North American regulatory cooperation that the Department of Commerce hosted in April 2006, which provided the basis for possible elements to be included in the Framework, su ch as transparency and information sharing. Discussions about the Framework continue, and it is expected that the Framework will be announced in 2007. 62Additional information on this and other SPP prosperity initiatives is available at: http://spp.gov/spp/report_to_leaders/prosperity_annex.pdf 63The March 2006 Leaders Statement is available at: http://spp.gov/pdf/security_an d_prosperity_partnership_of_nor th_america_statement.pdf 40 C. Other International Initiatives The rationale for transatlantic and North Am erican regulatory cooperation also applies to U.S. relationships with other key trading pa rtners. Accordingly, the U.S. has undertaken initiatives with the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Devel opment (OECD). APEC is an international organization created in 1989 to promote free tr ade and international cooperation among the Pacific Rim countries. Work by the OECD on regul atory reform has helped promote efforts to improve the quality of regulations throughout the world. APEC-OECD Integrated Checklist for Regulatory Reform U.S. efforts within APEC have focused on the Integrated Checklist for Regulatory Reform. The Integrated Checklist is a self-assessm ent tool that reflects a holistic approach to regulatory reform, including regulatory, anti-trust, and mark et-openness policies.64 The Checklist was the product of th e APEC-OECD Cooperative Initiati ve on Regulatory Reform, a collaborative effort between APEC and the OECD . Following the endorsement of the Integrated Checklist at a June 2005 ministeria l-level meeting held in Jeju Island, Korea, APEC has begun a dialogue on capacity building, which will include the voluntary use of the Integrated Checklist in country self-assessments. The Integrated Checklist was discussed at a September 12, 2006, meeting of the APEC Economic Committee at which the United States was one of three economies to present the results of the Integrated Checklist. At this meeting, the U.S. delegation provided a response to the Checklist, which was r eceived with interest from the other economies in APEC. OECD Work on Regulatory Management and Reform The OECD is an international forum compri sed of 30 market-orien ted democracies that work together to promote sustainable economic growth by addressing economic, social, and governance challenges faced by member countries. OECD staff conducts research on topics of interest to OECD member countries, and representatives of member countries meet to exchange information in committees devoted to key issues. One of these issues is regulatory management and reform. In 1995, OECD Ministers asked the OECD to assess the regulatory polic ies of member countries. The resulting 1995 Recommendations for Improving the Quality of Government Regulation were the first-ever internationally accepted statement of regulatory principles.65 The OECD expanded its examination of regulatory policy to include market openness and anti-trust policy in a multidisciplinary framework\u2014embodied in the 1997 Recommendations for Regulatory Reform\u2014which it used to review reform effort s in member countries. To date, the OECD has conducted 20 country reviews, including the fi rst review of a non-member country: Russia. 64A copy of the Integrated Checklist is available at: http://www.apec.org/apec/documents_re ports/economic_committee/2005.html 65See Stimulating Smarter Regulation: 2002 Report to Congress on the Costs and Benefits of Regulations , p. 65. http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/infor eg/2002_report_to_congress.pdf 41 Based on the lessons learned from the count ry reviews and developments in member countries, in April 2005 the OECD adopted Guid ing Principles for Regulatory Quality and Performance.66 While the 2005 principles reaffirmed the 1997 recommendations, several issues were given more prominence, including pol icy coherence through multi-level governmental coordination, ex ante impact assessments of regulatory policies, and market openness. D. Response to Peer Reviews and Public Co mments on International Developments in Regulatory Policy One peer reviewer (2) provide d, at OMB's request, extensive comments on this chapter. Specifically, the peer reviewer recommended that OMB retain the equivalent of this chapter in future Reports, noting the ongoing nature of the in ternational activities. The commenter also suggested that OMB devote signific antly more attention to the SPP, particularly with respect to the development of the SPP Regulatory C ooperation Framework and the institutional responsibilities within the Executive Office of the Pres ident for overseeing the U.S. Government's participation in the SPP. With respect to the first recommendation, OMB agrees that the regulatory activities desc ribed in this report will conti nue and that future updates on new developments and achievements are likely to warrant inclusion in future Reports. OMB also agrees that the SPP, and in part icular the initiative to develop a Regulatory Cooperation Framework by 2007, is important and lik ely to achieve important benefits for the U.S. and its neighbors. Accord ingly, we have provided additi onal details about recent and ongoing SPP activities. The same peer reviewer also recommended that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within OMB be the \"central regula tory agency\" referred to by the two Presidents and the Prime Minister in their March 31, 2006, stat ement on the Framework, and that it is OIRA that should take the lead in U.S. efforts to wo rk with Canada and Mexico on the development of a North American Regulatory C ooperation Framework. The peer reviewer expressed the view that \"[o]nly OMB, and only OIRA within OMB - with the authorities granted under E.O. 12866 - can serve as the Executive Offi ce catalyst to '[s]trengthen re gulatory cooperation, including at the onset of the regulatory pro cess, to minimize barriers.'\" In response to this recommendation, OMB would note the important leadership role th at the Commerce Department plays in the SPP prosperity initiatives. OMB agr ees that, given OIRA's role in coordinating U.S. regulatory policy, OIRA should participate in the effort to create the Framework. OMB hopes that, by providing the overview of SPP activities in this Report, we can cont ribute to the success of this initiative. The two other peer reviewers found this chap ter informative (3) and useful (1), but both requested additional information on the impact of regulatory oversight mechanisms, specifically the use of regulatory impact analysis. OMB agrees that analysis is an important issue, and we believe that the comparison of OMB and Commi ssion guidelines on regulatory analysis provided in Appendix D this Report addresses many of th e critical challenges faced by policymakers in the U.S. and Europe. 66See http://www.oecd.org/dat aoecd/24/6/34976533.pdf. 42 CHAPTER IV: UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INFORMATION QUALITY ACT Section 515 of the Treasury and General Gove rnment Appropriations Act, 2001 (Pub. L. No. 106-554, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3516 note), commonly know n as the \"Information Quality Act\", requires OMB to develop government-wide standard s \"for ensuring and maximizing\" the quality of information disseminated by Federal agencies. To implement the Information Quality Act, OMB issued final government-wide guidelines on February 22, 2002 (67 FR 8452) and each Federal agency was charged with promulgating its own Information Quality Guidelines. OMB facilitated th e development of these agency guidelines, working with the agencies to en sure consistency with the principles set forth in the government-wide guidelines. By October 1, 2002, almost all agencies had released their final guidelines, which became effective immediately. In previous reports, OMB has presented a thorough discussion of the Information Quality Act and its implementation, including a discus sion of perceptions and realities, legal developments, improving transparency, suggesti ons for improving correction requests, and the recent release of the OMB Information Quality Bulletin on Peer Review.67 In August 2004, the OIRA Administrator i ssued a memorandum to the President's Management Council requesting that agencies po st all Information Quality correspondence on agency web pages to increase th e transparency of the process.68 In their FY04 Information Quality Reports to OMB, agencies provided OMB with the specific links to these web pages and OMB provided this information to the public in our last update on Information Quality. 69 This increase in transparency allows the public to view a ll the agency responses to correction requests and to keep track of the status of corr ection requests that may be of interest. This chapter provides a summary of the curren t status of correction requests that were received in FY 2005, as well as an update on the status of reque sts received in FY 2003 and FY 2004. Agency FY 2006 Information Quality repo rts are due to OMB on December 15, 2006. Our discussion of the individual corrections and agency responses is minimal; all correspondence between the public and the agen cies regarding thes e requests is publicly available on the agencies' Information Quality web pages. On June 16, 2005, OMB's Information Quality Bulletin on Peer Review became effective for all influential scientific information, includin g highly influential scien tific assessments. As of December 16, 2005, agencies are posting peer review agendas for both influential scientific information and highly influential scientific assessments on their we b sites. The agencies first 67See Information Quality, a Report to Congress FY 2003, OMB, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inf oreg/fy03_info_quality_rpt.pdf , and Validating Regulatory Analysis: 2005 Report to Congress on the Costs and Benefits of Federal Regulations and Unfunded Mandates on State, Local, and Tribal 2005 Report to Congress on the Costs and Benefits of Federal Regulations and Unfunded Mandates on State, Local, and Tribal Entities, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg /2005_cb/final_2005_cb_report.pdf . 43 annual peer review reports ar e due to OMB on December 15, 2006. Once this information is evaluated, OMB plans to share peer review upda tes with readers in our future Information Quality reports. A. New Correction Requests Receiv ed by the Agencies in FY 2005 Table 1 below lists the departments and agenci es that received requests for corrections and appeals in FY05. Table 4-1. Departments and Agencies that Received Information Quality Correction Requests in FY 2005 Agency Number of FY05 Correction Requests Number of Appeals Received in FY05 Department of Commerce 2 Department of Defense 1 Department of Health and Human Services 5 5 Department of Interior 1 Department of Labor 4 1 Department of Transportation 3 Department of State 1 Environmental Protection Agency 7 6 Federal Communications Commission 1 Federal Trade Commission 1 General Services Administration 1 Total 27 12 As Table 4-1 shows, in FY 2005 there were a to tal of 27 requests for correction that were sent to 11 different agencies. The Federa l Trade Commission and the General Services Administration received their first correction requests in FY 2005. Twelve appeals were received by the agencies in FY 2005. Two of these were on new re quests that were initiated in FY 2005 and the remaining 10 were on correction requests that originated in FY 2003 and FY 2004. The 27 requests and 12 appeals can be f ound at the agencies' Information Quality websites. The correction request s received in FY 2005 were as di verse and interesting as those received in previous years. For instance, the Administration for Children and Families (part of the Department of Health and Human Services ) received a request from Advocates for Youth and the Sexuality Information and Education C ouncil of the United States regarding grantee abstinence curricula; the Environmental Protec tion Agency received a request for correction from the Wood Preservative Science Council rega rding the arsenic cancer risk value; the Department of Labor received a request from a university professor regarding language 44 pertaining to anesthetic gas use and small an imals; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (part of the Depa rtment of Commerce) received a request from a private citizen regarding transparency in weather forecasts; a nd the Department of Transportation received a request from the Alliance of Automobile Ma nufacturers regarding the preliminary economic analysis for a rule related to side impact protection. For the 11 agencies that received correcti on requests, the links to FY 2005 correction requests are provided below: Department Q_request_for_correction_05.htm Department of tion requests received in FY 2005, only 24 of these are considered by OMB to be different in substan ce from the simple webpage fixes or technical corrections that agencies have always received. Thus we are not includi ng discussion of the three requests to the Department of State, the General Services Admini stration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at the Department of Transportation.70 Figure 4-1 shows the status of the 24 correc tion requests. For all the details relating to the specific requests, including agency responses, readers are encouraged to visit agency Information Quality websites. As noted in our previous report,71 OMB cautions readers against drawing any conclusions about trends or year-to-year comparisons because agency procedures for classifying correction requests are still evol ving. However, we note that in FY 2003 there were 48 correction requests, and in FY 2004 th ere were 37 correction requests. 70The request to State was from a citizen looking for assistance finding notary services at the U.S. Consulate in Chennai; the request to GSA pointed out a publication error in the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) (41 CFR 300-304); and the request to NHTSA was from a citizen concer ned about information connected to them in the National Driver Registry. 71 See Validating Regulatory Analysis: 2005 Report to Congre ss on the Costs and Benefits of Federal Regulations and Unfunded Mandates on State, Local, and Tribal Entities , http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg /2005_cb/final_2005_cb_report.pdf . 45 24 Requests 1 Corrected 7 Denied 10 Pending 6 Other Processes/ Mechanisms 2 Appeals 1 Denied (will be handled in a rulemaking process) 1 Pending Figure 4-1: Status of IQ corre ction requests received in FY05. B. Status of Outstanding Correction Reque sts Received by the Agencies in FY 2003-04 At the close of FY 2004, 17 Information Qua lity correction request responses and seven appeal responses were pending from the agencies. Figure 4-2 shows the status of the outstanding correction request respon ses at the close of FY 2005. As Figure 4-2 shows, agencies had responded to 14 correction requests a nd were still working on respons es to the other three. This figure also shows that while four correction re quests were denied, th ere were five appeal requests. This is due to the f act that one agency received an a ppeal request on a response that was categorized as partially corrected. 46 17 Requests Pending 6 Corrected/ Partially Corrected 4 Denied 2 Pending 2 Other Processes/ Mechanisms 4 Appeals 1 Denied 3 Pending 1 Appeal 1 Pending Figure 4-2: FY 2005 Status of Pending Co rrection Requests from FY 2003 and FY 2004.

OMB presents more detailed explanation of these regulations in several documents. Rules from October 1, 1992 to Septembe r 30, 1995: Tables C-1 through C-3 in Appendix C of this Report. Rules from October 1, 1995 to March 31, 1999 can be found in Chapter IV of our 2000 Report. Rules from April 1, 1999 to September 30, 2001: Table 19 of the 2002 Report. Rules from October 1, 2001 to Septembe r 30, 2002: Table 19 of the 2003 Report. Rules from October 1, 2002 to Septembe r 30, 2003: Table 12 of the 2004 Report. Rules from October 1, 2003 to Septembe r 30, 2004: Tables 1-4 and A-1 of the 2005 Report. Rules from October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2005: Tables 1-4 and A-1 of this Report. In assembling estimates of benefits and costs presente d in Table 1-4, OMB has: (1) applied a uniform format for the presentation of benefit and cost estimates in order to make agency estimates more closely comparable with each other (for example, annualizing benefit and cost estimates); and (2) monetized quantitative estimates where th e agency has not done so (for example, converting Agency projections of quantifie d benefits, such as estimated injuries avoided per year or tons of pollutant reductions per year, to dollars using the valuation estimates discussed below). All benefit and cost estimates were adjust ed to 2001 dollars us ing the latest gross domestic product (GDP) deflator , available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the Department of Commerce.72 In instances where the nominal dollar values the agencies use for their benefits and costs is unclear, we assume the benefits and costs are presented in nominal dollar values of the year before the rule is finaliz ed. In periods of low inflation such as the past few years, this assumption does not impact the ove rall totals. All amortizations are performed using a discount rate of 7 percen t, unless the agency has alrea dy presented annualized, monetized results using a different explicit discount rate. OMB discusses, in this Report and in previ ous reports, the difficulty of estimating and aggregating the costs and benef its of different regulations ov er long time periods and across many agencies. In addition, where OMB has monetized quantitative estimates where the agency has not done so, we have attempted to be faithful to the respective agency approaches. The adoption of a uniform format for annualizing agency estimates allows, at least for purposes of illustration, the aggregation of benefit and cost estimates across rules; however, the agencies 72National Income and Product Accounts, available at http://www.bea.gov . 49 50have used different methodologies and valuations in quantifying and monetizing effects. Thus, an aggregation involves the assemblage of bene fit and cost estimates that are not strictly comparable. In part to address this issue, the 2003 Report included OMB's regulatory analysis guidance, also released as OMB Circular A-4, which took effect on January 1, 2004, for proposed rules and January 1, 2005 for final rules. The guidance recommends what OMB considers to be \"best practice\" in regulatory anal ysis, with a goal of strengthening the role of science, engineering, and economics in rulemaking. The overall goal of this guidance is a more competent and credible regulatory process and a mo re consistent regulatory environment. OMB expects that as more agencies adopt our recomme nded best practices, the costs and benefits we present in future reports will become more comparable across agencies and programs. The 2006 Report will be the first Report that includes fina l rules subject to OMB Circular A-4. OMB will work with the agencies to ensure that their impact analyses follow the new guidance. Table A-1 below presents the unmodified in formation on the impact s of 21 major rules reviewed by OMB from October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005, and includes additional explanatory text on how agen cies calculated the impacts for these rulemakings. Unless otherwise stated, the totals presented in Tabl e A-1 are annualized imp acts in 2001 dollars, which is the requested format in OMB Circular A-4. Table 1-4 in Chapter 1 of this Report presents the adjusted impact estimates for th e 11 rules finalized in 2004 that were added to the Chapter 1 accounting statement totals. Table A-1: Summary of Agency Estimates for Final Rules October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2005 (As of Date of Completion of OMB Review) Rule [FR Cite] Agency Benefits Costs Other Information Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy: Minimal Risk Regions and Importation to an agricultura l multi-sector analysis, the rule will result in a decline in consumer expenditures for beef in 2005 of about 1%. Costs: According to an agricultural mu lti-sector analysis, the rule will result in a decline in gross reve nues in 2005 for the combined livestock, feed, and grain sectors of 1.4% to 1.7%. Other Details: Both benefits and costs were annualized over 5 years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted of near-term price effects based on smaller elasticities, and of welfare effects based on imports of one-half the backlog and one-half the assumed numb er of fed cattle displaced from Canadian slaughter. Note that these impacts are technica lly economic transfers from domestic producers to domestic consumers and foreign producers. According to Circular A-4, however, impact analysis should be performed from the U.S. perspective. Therefore, for the purpos es of this Report, transfers from the U.S. are considered costs, and transfers from other nations to the U.S. are considered benefits. The full RIA can be found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/issues/bse/bse.html 51 Rule [FR Cite] Agency Benefits Costs Other 3%) Benefits: Change in consumer welfare due to the lower prices and expanded quantities of avocados in the U.S. market. Costs: Change in producer welfare. USDA also analyzed the risk of the introduction of quarantine pests into the U.S., and concluded that there was no such additional risk due to expanded trade in avocados. The risk assessment prepared by USDA establishes that the annual number of avocados infested by quarantine pests imported into the United States is zero. Other details: The analysis directly estimates the annual impacts for a three year period following the liberalizati on of the avocado tr ade. Economic impacts were analyzed using a partial equilibrium model that does not provide annualized data for subsequent years. The full RIA can be found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/avocados/ Designate Critical Habitat for 13 Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) of Pacific Salmon and Steelhead in Washington, Oregon and Idaho [70 (3%) Benefits: Section 7 of the ESA requires every federal agency to ensure that any action it authorizes, funds, or carries out is not likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of cr itical habitat, which are identified by this rule. This complements the requirem ent that federal agencies ensure their actions are not likely to jeopardize the co ntinued existence of a listed species. Another possible benefit is that the designation of critical habitat can serve to educate the public regarding the potential conservation value of an area. This may focus and contribute to conservatio n efforts by clearly delineating areas of high conservation value for certain species. Costs: Costs are annualized and mone tized over 20 years. Monetized costs include the changes in federal activity on the lands used as critical habitat. In addition, non-monetized costs include changes in flow regimes for dams and other water supply structures that could potentially affect the supply of energy and the production of agricultural crops and other outputs dependent on water supply.

In addition to safety benefits, due to the spread of harvesting effort across a long er period of time and eliminating the fishing \"derby,\" DOC discussed non-quantified benefits. There is a potential for increased consumer surplus from increased availability due to longer seasons, increased product recovery rates, and quality improvements. Producer surplus to harvesters and pro cessors will increase as harvesting and processing costs decline. Producer su rplus may increase if benefits from increases in quality and quantity are captured by producers (harvesters and processors). Improved management and less wasteful fishing may also lead to improvements in productivity of the stocks, which could lead to potential increases to producer an d consumer surplus. Costs: Monetized costs are due to increased information collections. Other non-quantified costs may arise due to su rplus vessels entering other fisheries and imposing external costs. There are also potential transactions costs in quota share markets. Other details: The analysis estimated annual impacts for a 10-year period. Although this rule does not have monetized costs or benefits exceeding $100 million in any one year, it was designated economically significant because the value of the fishery itself, and theref ore the estimated value of the tradable quotas allocated to participants, is greater than $100 million yearly.

Benefits: CFC reductions will occur from 12/31/08 until relevant patents for albuterol substitutes expire around 12/31/2010 or 12/31/2017. This estimate is based on 2004 utilization of CFCs for albuterol. Projecting emissions reductions for future years is complicated by changes in the size of the market and changes in future CFC allocations by the parties to the Montreal Protocol. Costs: This is an estimate of the decrease in albuterol MDI use that will result from price increases caused by the rule. FDA assumed these reductions will occur between 12/31/08 and 12/31/10 or 12/31/17, depending on the expiration of relevant patents. This estimate was based on 2004 utilization and prices. Other details: FDA also estimated substa ntial transfers and budget effects due to this rule. First, they estimated an annual increase in Medicare/Medicaid payments to the inhaler industry of $298 million due to the higher prices of albuterol substitutes. They also estimated an $830 million transfer from 3rd party insurers and albuterol users to substitute manufacturers and marketers. This is based on price differences and utilization data by payer type from the 1st half of 2004. It is an estimate of how much extra these payers would have had to pay if CFC albuterol MDIs were not available in 2004. The full RIA was published in the FR notice. 54 Rule [FR Cite] Agency Benefits Costs Other Information Amendments to the Performance Standard for Diagnostic X- Ray Systems and Their Major Components Benefits: The amendments will benefit patients by enabling physicians to reduce fluoroscopic radiation doses and as sociated detriment and, hence, to use the radiation more efficiently to achieve medical objectives. The monetized health benefits of lowering doses are reductions in the potential for radiation induced cancers and in the nu mbers of skin burn s associated with higher levels of x-ray exposure during fluoroscopically guided therapeutic procedures. FDA believes that the amendments will not degrade the quality of fluoroscopic images produced while reducing the radiation doses. Costs: The rule will impose costs on manufacturers of fluoroscopic and radiographic systems by requiring new design features on their equipment, and on FDA for increased compliance activities. Some costs represent one- time expenditures to develop new designs or manufacturing processes to incorporate the regulatory changes. Other costs are the ongoing costs of providing improved equipment performan ce and features with each installed unit. Other details: FDA annualized estim ated impacts over 10 years. The summary RIA was published in the FR notice. The full RIA is on display in the Division of Dockets Management. 55 Rule [FR Cite] Agency Benefits Costs Other Information Establishment and Maintenance of Records Pursuant to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 monetized benefits are FDA's estimate of the improvement in their standard food borne outbreak investigations due to the recordkeeping requirements of this rule. In addition, FDA stated that the rule will help reduce the number of people who become ill during deliberate foodborne outbreaks by reducing the time required for preventive action. Furthermore, the final rule will eliminate the recurrence of outbreaks that may have been prevented had poor records quality not resulted in prematurely terminating the initial traceback investigation. Since a su bstantial portion of the benefits of this rule, improvements to homeland security, were not monetized, this rule was not included in the Chapter 1 totals even though FDA did monetize the relatively small non-security benefits. Costs: FDA estimated startup costs for learning, records redesign, and planning for records access requests in the first 2 years following publication of the rule. Additional records maintenance costs and records retention costs are incurred each year following publication of the rule beginning in the second year for large and small firms, and in the third year for very small firms. Lear ning costs and records access planning costs for new entrants are also incurred each year following publication of the final rule beginning after the second ye ar. Costs are annualized over 20 years. The full RIA was published in the FR notice. Immunization Standard for Long Term Care Facilities [70 7% and 3%) Benefits: Are based on the lives saved based on the higher immunization rates in long term care facilities due to this rule. CMS assumed that before the rule, 74% of long-term care residents receive annual influenza vaccinations and between 39-56 percent receive pneumococcal vaccinations. CMS assumes that this rule will increas e both vaccination rates to 90%. Costs: Are the direct cost of admini stering the increased vaccinations and for facilities developing new policies and procedures for administration. Other details: CMS also estimated $30 million per year cost to Medicare and Medicaid due to paying for increas ed number of vaccinations. The full RIA was published in the FR notice. 56 Rule [FR Cite] Agency Benefits Costs Other Information Electronic Transmission of Passenger and Crew Manifests for Vessels and Aircraft [70 FR 17820] DHS-BCBP Homeland Security $127 million Benefits: DHS stat ed that submission of manifest information to DHS from the airlines and ships is a necessary component of the nation's continuing program of ensuring aviation and vessel safety and protecting national security. The required information also will assist in the efficient inspection and control of passengers and crew members and thus will facilitate the effective enforcement of the customs, i mmigration, and tran sportation security laws. Costs: In the first year this rule is in effect, DHS estimates the cost will be $166 million as companies reprogram existing systems and purchase necessary equipment. Once reprogrammi ng is complete and equipment is in place, DHS estimates an average annual cost of $135 million as users submit information electronically. The annual cost is driven primarily by passenger counts and crew loads in air and cruise ship travel. The costs were annualized over 10 years. The full RIA was published in the FR notice. Regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Housing Goals [69 FR 63580] HUD Not quantified Not quantified Benefits: HUD stated that homeownership and accessibility of homeownership are expected to in crease due to the rulemaking. Costs: HUD stated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs) will exert additional underwriting and marketing efforts in order to better serve the goal populations. Other details: HUD estimated a within market transfer of approximately $180 million per year (studied over 3 years) from lenders and GSEs to the target borrowers, due to a 25 basis point drop in borrower interest costs.

Data to estimate producer surplus are not availa ble; producer surplus is likely minimal compared to consumer surplus, but would also be a benefit of the rule if monetized. Costs: The economic model did not produce a separate estimate of the costs of the rulemaking. Other details: DOI performed an economic impact analysis to jointly estimate the impact of all of early and late season migratory bird hunting regulations for the 2004-2005 season, but did not update that estimate for the 2006 season. DOI finalized a total of three Early Season regulations, the Final Framework (70 FR 51521), the Bag and Possession Limits (70 FR 51983), and the Regulations on Certain Federal Indian Reservations and Ceded Lands (70 FR 51983). This analysis looks at the economic effects of duck hunting, the major component of all migratory bird hunting. Sufficient data exists for duck hunting to generate an analysis of hunter behavior in response to regulatory alternatives. The analysis for all migratory bird hunting is not possible because of data limitations, but can be inferred from the results of the duck hunting analysis presented here. The RIA is not available online. 58 Rule [FR Cite] Agency Benefits Costs Other Information Migratory Bird Hunting; 2005- 2006 Migratory Game Bird Hunting FR 55665] DOI-FWS See \"Early Benefits: The listed benefits repr esent estimated consumer surplus.

Electronic Orders for Schedule I and II Controlled Substances FR at 3%) Benefits: The rule allows registrants who order Schedule I and II controlled substances to issue orders electronically, using a digital certificate provided by DEA to sign the orders. The electronic form system provides for many efficiencies, such as an avoidance of the need to transcribe data from electronic systems to paper and back again, the resources that must be dedicated to physically handling and accounting for the paper documents, and the time required to transmit the paper document from the customer to the supplier before an order can be filled. Costs: Compliance costs for the electr onic system include one time costs for the installation of software and the cost of obtaining digital certificates, and ongoing annual costs for processing orders. The electronic order costs assume that registrants take 5 years to adopt electronic orders, so electronic order costs include a mix of paper and electronic for the first four years. Initial compliance costs are also an nualized over 5 years. The full RIA is available at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov /fed_regs/rules/2005/index.html 59 Rule [FR Cite] Agency Benefits Costs Other Information Hours of Service of Drivers [70 FR 7$ 3%) Benefits: The positive benefits are the sa fety benefits due to the elimination of the 2003 rule's allowance of split resting periods in the truck's sleeper berth. Costs: The negative costs primarily represent the relaxed requirements for short haul trucking. Other Details: The baseline for the costs and benefits of this rule is the 2003 final Hours of Service rule, which is also included in the totals presented in Tables 1-1 and 1-2. DOT also performe d an extensive sensitivity analysis of allowing the 11-th hour of truck driving. The full RIA is available online at: http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules- regulations/topics/hos/regulatory-impact.htm Tire Pressure The agency estimates the to tal quantified safety benefits from reductions in crashes due to skidding/loss of control, stopping distance, flat tires, and blowouts. The unit of analysis in DOT rulemakings is equivalent lives saved, which weights injuries of different severities. DOT was unable to quantify the impact of higher tire inflation on hydroplaning and crashes or on overloading the vehicle and the risk of tire failure. The benefits also include lower fuel consumption, less tread wear , less property damage, and less travel delay. Costs: DOT estimated costs are primarily due to vehicle redesign and maintenance, and the opportunity cost of refilling tires. Although the agency quantified the major impacts on maintenance costs from having batteries in the system, they could not quantify other potential maintenance problems. Other details: The range of uncertainty re flects the different technologies that may be chosen by auto manufacturers in order to comply with the rule.

The unit of analysis in DOT rulemakings is equivalent lives saved, which weights injuries of different severities. Costs: DOT assumes that the manufacturers will choose to comply with today's requirements using either integrated or detachable seat belt designs, depending on vehicle characteristics and perceived customer desires. Other details: Benefits and costs were annualized over 25 years. The full RIA is available online at: http://dmses.dot.gov/docimages/pdf90/307712_web.pdf Upgrade of Head and 3%) Benefits: The benefits estimates are ba sed on a reduction of whiplash injuries in both the front and back seats Costs: The estimates are derived from tear down studies of head restraints from a variety of motor vehicles. DOT studied both integral and adjustable head restraints and found little difference in the cost per inch. Other details: Benefits and costs were annualized over 25 years.

EPA also stated that the rule leads to non- quantified ecological and visibility benefits. Costs: Costs are based primarily on the installation of control technology in the electric power sector. Other details: EPA also conducted an uncertainty analysis, but did not include ranges around th e presentation of their primary estimates.

EPA also stated that the rule leads to non-quantified ecological and visibility benefits. Costs: Costs are based primarily on the installation of the control technology in the electric power sector. Other details: The uncertainty range for benefits and costs reflect different modeling scenarios concerning the actions States may take to implement the BART requirements in this rule. Benef it and cost analyses for BART have the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in the baseline; therefore, emission reductions from Electricity Generating Units (EGUs) in the CAIR region are not included in the benefits and costs estimates for this rule. See RIA Chapters 4, 7, 8, and Appendix G for more information. The full RIA is available online at http://www.epa.gov/air/visibility/pdfs/bart_ria_2005_6_15.pdf Clean Air Mercury Rule--Electric Utility Steam Generating Units [70 28606] $3 million in 2020 million in 2020 ($1999 million in 2020 ($1999 at 3%) Benefits: EPA analyzed changes in mercury emissions, deposition, and the physical and biological processes that lead to the uptake of methylmercury in fish. The benefit estimates reflect th e value of avoided IQ decrements in children who had prenatal exposure via maternal fish consumption. The range reflects different assumptions about the toxicity of mercury and whether a threshold exists for IQ impacts. This primary estimate does not include the value of co-benefits of direct PM reductions, other possible health effects (e.g. some epidemiological studies suggest th at methylmercury is associated with cardiovascular disease in some populations), and possible ecosystem benefits. Costs: These are the social costs of the rule, and are primarily the result EPA's Integrated Planning Model of the impact of the rule on the utility industry. Other details: Both benefits and costs are presented for the year 2020, 2 years after the final Phase II cap becomes effective.

In addition to quantified benefits, EPA also states that the follo wing are non-quantified benefits of the rule: reduction in non-fatal risk to sensitive subpopulations, reduction in risk and response costs during outbreaks, reduction in co-occurring/emerging pathogen risk, reduction in endemic morbidity and mortality risk associated with uncovered finished water reservoi rs, improved aesthetic water quality, and reduced costs of averting behaviors. Costs: EPA estimates costs for all rule activities including: rule implementation, source water monitoring, adding treatment, and compliance reporting. EPA assumes nearly all surface water and Ground Water Under the Direct Influence of Surface Water systems will incur rule implementation and initial source water monitoring costs. Other details: Costs and Benefits annua lized over 25 years. The range of benefits and costs reported here are due to different analytical datasets and valuation methodologies. The \"traditional\" cost of illness (COI) approach values the benefits based on medical costs avoided, while EPA developed an \"enhanced\" COI approach, which adds a value for pain and suffering. The full RIA is available online in EPA's Docket on www.regulations.gov Docket number EPA-HQ-OW-2002-0039-0760, B: VALUATION ESTIMATES FOR REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES73 Agencies continue to take different approaches to monetizing benefits for rules that affect small risks of premature death. As a general ma tter, we continue to defer to the individual agencies' judgment in this area. Except wher e noted, in cases where the agency both quantified and monetized fatality risks, we have made no ad justments to the agency's estimate. In cases where the agency provided a quantified estimate of fatality risk, but did not monetize it, we have monetized these estimates in order to conve rt these effects into a common unit. The following is a brief discussion of OMB' s valuation estimates for effects which agencies identified and quantified, but did not m onetize. As a practical matter, the aggregate benefit and cost estimates are relatively insensitiv e to the values we have assigned for these rules because the aggregate benefit estimates are dominated by those rules where EPA provided quantified and monetized be nefit and cost estimates. Injury. For NHTSA rules, we adopted NHTSA's approach of converting nonfatal injuries to \"equivalent fatalities.\" These ra tios are based on NHTSA's estimates of the value individuals place on reducing the risk of injury of varying severity relative to that of reducing risk of death.74 For OSHA rules, we monetized only lost wo rkday injuries usi ng a value of $50,000 per injury averted. 1. Change in Gasoline Fuel Consumption. We valued reduced gasoline consumption at $0.80 per gallon pre-tax. This equates to retail (at-the-pump) prices in the $1.10 - $1.30 per gallon range. 2. Reduction in Barrels of Crude Oil Spilled. OMB valued each barrel prevented from being spilled at $2,000. This is double th e sum of the most likely estimates of environmental damages plus cleanup co sts contained in a published journal article75 3. Change in Emissions of Air Pollutants. Please see the following paragraphs for an explanation of these values. A ll values are in 2001 dollars. Hydrocarbon: $600 to $2,700 per ton Nitrogen Oxide (stationary): $370 $3,800 per ton Nitrogen Oxide (mobile): $11,600 per ton Sulfur Dioxide: ton Particulate Matter: $10,000 to $100,000 per ton 73The following discussion updates the monetization approach used in previous reports and draws on examples from this and previous years. 74National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, The Economic Cost of Motor Vehicle Crashes, 1994 , Table A-1. http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/economic/ecomvc1994.html Note that the light truck average fuel economy rule NHTSA finalized in 2003 did present quantified and monetized costs and benefits, which we did not adjust. 75Brown and Savage, \"The Economics of Double-Hulled Tankers,\" Maritime Policy and Management , Volume 23(2), 1996, pp. 167-175. 64 The estimates for reductions in hydrocarbon emissions were obtai ned from EPA's RIA for the 1997 rule revising the primary Nationa l Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and fine particulate matter (PM). EPA believes that there are a number of reasons to expect that reductions in NO x emissions from ground-level mobile sources achi eve different air quality improvements relative to reductions from electric utilities and other stationary sources with \"tall stacks.\" In response, OMB has adopted different bene fit transfer estimates for NO x reductions from stationary sources (e.g., electric utilities) a nd from mobile sources.76 For the central estimate of NO x emissions for mobile sources, we used estimates from the Tier II/Gasoline Sulfur rule RIA, while recognizing that the Tier II analysis was based on an air quality fate and transpor t model that had limited treatment of atmospheric chemistry.77 Based on the final Tier 2/Gasoline Sulfur RIA, EPA estimated that NO x reductions would yield benefits of $4900 (1999$) per ton. Analysis of recent EPA rules yield several estimates for the central estimate of NO x benefits per ton from stationary electric utility sources (See the Regul atory Impact Analyses for the \"NO x SIP Call\" and the Section 126 rules, available on the web at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/ecas/econguid.html. In addition, see Memo to NSR Docket from Br yan Hubbell, Senior Economist, Innovative Strategies and Economics Group, EPA). Based on thes e studies, the mortality-based benefits of NO x reductions from stationary sources (electric utilities) are estimated to be $1,300 (1999$) per ton.78 New results based on EPA's ongoing analys es supporting the suite of Clean Air Rules (including the Clean Air Interstate Rule, Clean Air Visibility Rule, and Clean Air Mercury Rule) may provide better estimates for future reports. NO x benefit estimates are difficult to transfer to other applications, however. The location of redu ctions, reductions in other PM precursors, air chemistry, meteorology, emission release heights, baseline conditions, etc. can have dramatic effects on the relationship between NO x emission reductions and ambient PM concentrations. Further, the understanding of the atmospheri c chemistry characterizing PM formation, and photochemical air quality mode ling are rapidly evolving. EPA also developed central estimates for the benefits associated w ith reductions in SO2 from electric utilities. Based on an analysis outlined in a June 20, 2001 EPA memo to the file, \"Benefits Associated with Electricity Generati ng Emissions Reductions Realized Under the NSR program,\" we used $7,300 per ton. We also developed ranges around these central estimates of the per-ton value of benefits of emission reduction in nitrogen oxides and sulf ur dioxide. EPA calcula ted ratios of the high and low benefits estimates to the central estimate for the four fairly recent rules for which there was sufficient information to do so. Those ru les are Tier 2, Section 126/Ozone Transport, Heavy-Duty Diesel Engines, and Non-Road Diesel Engines. The mean ratio of the low benefit estimates to the corresponding central estimates fo r these four rules was .22. The mean ratio of 76The five key assumptions underlying the benefit estimates for reductions in NO x emissions are described on p. 7. 77Additional details on the Tier II benefits analysis ar e available in the Tier II/Sulfur Final Rulemaking RIA, available on the web at http://www.epa.gov/oms/fuels.htm. 78This memo reported that: \"Based on previous EPA analys es, the average mortality-related benefits per ton of NO x reduced are around $1300 and the average benefits per ton of SO 2 reduced are around $7300 for electricity- generating units.\" 65 the high benefit estimates to the mean was 2.27. This implies an average ratio of high to low benefit estimates of approximately 10 (2.27/.22). Therefore we applied this factor of 10 as an uncertainty range in our presenta tion of the benefits of seve ral rules regulating mobile and stationary sources of emissions. These rule are: Deposit Control Ga soline, Federal Test Procedures, and Marine Engine s (1996-1997); New Locomotives (1996-1997); Non-Road Diesel Engines II and Non-Handheld Engines (1998-19 99); Hand-Held Engines Phase II (1999-2000); Duty Engines (2000-2001); Municipa l Waste Combustors (1995-1996); Acid Rain NO x Phase II (1996-1997); Steam Generating Units (1998-1999); National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Stat ionary Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines; and NESHAP for Plyw ood and Composite Wood Products. As mentioned above, OMB only monetized bene fits estimates for rules that were not otherwise monetized by the agencies. Therefore, these per ton benefits estimates were only applied to EPA rules in which emission impacts we re quantified but not m onetized by EPA. We will continue to work with EPA on updating the ra nge of benefits in order to more accurately represent the magnitude and the su bstantial range of uncertainty i nherent in these estimates. In order to help address the uncertain ty and difficulty inherent in the benefit transfer approach, we have asked EPA to provide us with the Agency's estimates of the benefits per ton using the Agency's air quality models and other tools for a ll air rules that were fi nalized without such an estimate. We hope to be able to use these es timates in future Reports to Congress, thereby reducing somewhat the uncertainty and providing a more consiste nt approach to benefits. A. Adjustment for Differences in Time Frame across These Analyses Agency estimates of benefits and costs cover widely varying time periods. The differences in the time frames used for the vari ous rules evaluated generally reflect the specific characteristics of individual rules, such as expected capital depreciation periods or time to full realization of benefits. In order to allow us to provide an aggregate estimate of benefits and costs, we developed benefit and cost time streams for each of the rules. Where agency analyses provide annual or annualized es timates of benefits and costs, we used these estimates in developing streams of benefits and costs over tim e. Where the agency estimate provided only annual benefits and costs for specific years, we us ed a linear interpolation to represent benefits and costs in the intervening years. B. Further Caveats In order for comparisons or aggregation to be meaningful, benefit and cost estimates should correctly account for all substantial eff ects of regulatory actions, including potentially offsetting effects, which may or may not be reflected in the ava ilable data. OMB has not made any changes to agency monetized estimates. To th e extent that agencies have adopted different monetized values for effects\u2014for example, di fferent values for a statistical life\u2014these differences remain embedded in the tables. A ny comparison or aggregation across rules should also consider a number of factors which our pres entation does not address. For example, these analyses may adopt different baselines in terms of the regulations and contro ls already in place. In addition, the analyses for these rules may well treat uncertainty in different ways. In some cases, agencies may have developed alternat ive estimates reflecting upper- and lower-bound 66 estimates. In other cases, the agencies may offe r a midpoint estimate of benefits and costs. In still other cases the agency estimates may reflect only upper-bound estimates of the likely benefits and costs. While OMB has relied in many instances on agency practices in monetizing costs and benefits, citation of, or reliance on, agency data in this Report should not be taken as an OMB endorsement of all the varied methodologies used to derive benefits and cost estimates. 67 APPENDIX C: THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF 1992-1995 MAJOR RULES Tables C-1 to C-3 list the rules that were omitted from the 10-year running totals presented in Chapter 1 of our Reports to Congr ess. Table C-1 consists of the annualized, monetized costs and benefits of rules for wh ich OMB concluded review between October 1, 1994 and September 30, 1995. These rules were in cluded in Chapter 1 of the 2005 Report as part of the 10-year totals, but ar e not included in the dr aft 2006 Report. Table C-2 lists the rules completed between October 1, 1993 and Septem ber 30, 1994, and Table C-3 lists the rules completed between October 1, 1992 and September 30, 1993. Please note that since publication of the 2004 Report, we have updated the benefits pe r ton ranges based on a new analysis of the sources of uncertainty in EPA air regulations. Th is analysis is explained in more detail in Appendix B above. In order to be consistent with Chapter 1 impacts, for rules presented in Tables C-1 to C-3 where OMB monetized EPA estim ates of the tons of pollutants avoided, we updated the impact estimates to reflect the new benefits per ton ranges. We continue to believe that the 10-year wi ndow is the appropriate time period for which to limit the Chapter 1 accounting statement, si nce we do not believe that the pre-regulation estimates of the costs and benefits of rules issued over ten years ago are very reliable or useful for informing current policy decisions. In orde r to provide transparency, however, we have included in this Appendix all rulemakings that ha ve been omitted because of our decision to limit our accounting statement to 10 years.

The U.S. Executive Branch has been carrying out RIAs, with emphasis on cost-benefit analysis, for the pa st two to three decades. In the European Commission, sectoral analysis re quirements (for example, analysis that only looked at environmental impacts), were recently combined into a requirement for an integrated and comprehensive impact assessment. There is now recognition shared on both sides of the Atlantic that ex ante analysis of likely impacts of regulator y actions are essential for good policy making. The ongoing regulatory dialogue between the Unite d States and the European Union is timely and important for ensuring that regulatory ac tion by both sides does not create unnecessary and thus detrimental economic and trade obstacles. In order to further the understanding of this regulatory dialogue, a thorough knowledge of each other's ex ante impact analysis is essential. This section looks at the tw o sets of guidelines, OMB Circular A-4, and the European Commission's Impact Assessment guideline.81 Section one begins with an assessment of the legislative backgrounds against which RIAs are produced in the U.S. and at the EU level, and includes a comparison of the lega l or other bases that underpins ex ante impact analysis in both systems. In addition, this section looks at how subs idiarity and federalism are handled, the role of consultation, the provisions that have been ma de for ensuring an efficient use of available resources, and how impacts in a nd vis-\u00e0-vis third countries are taken into account. Section two looks at the more technical aspect s that an analysis of impacts in cludes. The role of cost benefit and cost effectiveness analyses is discussed, as well as how parameter values such as discount rates are dealt with. Assessing the impact of new proposals on administrative costs and monitoring and evaluation requirements, wh ich are peculiar to the Commission's RIA guidelines, is explained and there is a discussion of how risk and uncertainty analysis is handled. Part three provides concluding thoughts and suggested next steps for future research. 79 This appendix is adapted primarily from a joint workin g paper authored by Cavan O-Connor Close, Enterprise and Industry Directorate-General, European Commission and Dominic Mancini, OMB/OIRA, titled \"Comparison of U.S. and European Commission guidelines on Regulatory Impact Assessment/Analysi s.\" In particular, this appendix's description of European Commission activities represents Mr. Close's views. 80 The European Commission uses the term \"Impact Assessmen t,\" or IA. For simplicity, throughout this appendix we use the abbreviation \"RIA\" to refer to both Regulatory Impact Analyses in the U.S., and Impact Assessments in the EU when referring to regulatory analysis in the gene ral terms. We retain the abbreviation IA when referring specifically to the European Commission Impact Assessment Guidelines. 81 For ease of presentation, from this point on the append ix refers to RIAs prepared by U.S. Executive Branch agencies as \"U.S.\" RIAs, and RIAs prepared for European Commission legislative proposals as European Union, or \"EU\" RIAs 71 A. General Issues The Two Legislative Processes Before looking at the two sets of analytical requirements in mo re detail, it is important to appreciate that there are signifi cant differences in the legislativ e process between the U.S. and the EU Awareness of these differences is esse ntial for understanding the underpinnings of the two sets of guidelines82. In the U.S., Article I, Section 1, of the C onstitution gives the Congress the sole power to make laws. Also, laws can be enacted through ov errides of failures to sign and vetoes while Congress in session. Over time, Congress has pa ssed a number of laws authorizing the creation of and assigning a mission to Executive Branch regulatory agencies. There are over 100 federal agencies and subagencies with regulatory mandat es from Congress, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. One of the primary tools these agencies use to fulfill their mission is a \"rule\" or \"regulation\" which, when finalized, has the force and effect of law. Regulations are al most always much more detailed than the laws passed authorizing their issuance; in fact, that is often one of the justif ications for employing the use of regulations. The closest analogy to the EU is that U.S. laws are similar to EU \"primary legislation\" and U.S. rules and regulations are similar to EU \"secondary legislation.\" In fulfilling their mission, the regulatory agencies ha ve an obligation (partly created by statute, partly created by direction from th e President, who is head of the Executive Branch) to show that their rules have a sound reasonable basis. The most common procedure under which EU legi slation is devised is the so-called co- decision procedure.83 Under this procedure, the Commissi on puts forward a legislative proposal, which is sent to the European Parliament (E P) and the Council of the European Union (the Council). The EP discusses the proposal and ca n make amendments for the Commission to include in the version to be decided on in the Council. The Council will then accept it or adopt a \"common position,\"84 If the Council accepts, the act is a dopted and published in the Official Journal at which point it becomes law.85 Thus, although the Commissi on is the initiator of legislation, it is not the legislat or/legislative, nor does it normally determine th e final version of a piece of legislation. 82It is, of course, beyond the scope of this section to cover all the different aspects of the two political and legislative systems. For a more elaborate discussion on this please see http://europe.eu.int/eur- lex/en/about/pap/proces s_and_players3.html . 83For a more elaborate discussion on this please see http://ec.europa.eu/codecision/procedure/index_en.htm . It should be noted that an account of all the different ways in which le gislation takes place would involve an examination of the different procedur es under which the three EU institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - work with one another, which is beyond the scope of this section. 84The Council will normally take its decision by a qualified majority, except when its position differs from that of the Commission or if the Commission has not incorporated the Parliament's amendments in its proposal; in those cases, unanimity is required. 85If not, its common position is sent to Parliament which ca n accept it, reject it or propose amendments at \"second reading.\" In the latter case, the text is sent to Council fo r a second reading, which in turn, can approve the amended common position or not. If the Council refuses to approve, the Conciliation Committee is convened, which must try to find a compromise and produce a \"joint text,\" submitted to a \"third reading.\" 72 The main difference in the role of the RIA in the two systems is that the EU RIAs are produced for both primary and secondary legislat ion, whereas the U.S RIAs are produced only for regulations, not for statutes. Created at different points in the process, the analyses necessarily serve different purposes. In the U.S., the RIA is produced by the regulatory agency granted authority through legislation to regulate a particul ar subject. The RIA's goal is to assess how regulations can be done in the most efficient way fo r society, and also can be used as evidence in court (discussed in more detail below) to prove that the fina l regulation has a reasonable basis. Regulatory agencies produce a full RIA for proposed rules, wh ich then may be modifi ed, along with the rule itself, after public comment and further research. The Commission Impact Assessment (IA) guidelines state that an RIA is needed for \"items on the Commission's Work Programme, which means all regulatory proposals, white papers, expenditure programmes and negotiating gui delines for international agreements (with an economic, social or environmental impacts).\"86 The Commission's RIA accompanies the proposed legislation on its way to Parliament and Council, where it is used to inform legislative and public debate and aims to show that new legislation that is proposed by the Commission is based on a sound analysis of all its economic, so cial and environmental impacts, and that due consideration was given to feasible alternatives to regulations. The final form that a particular piece of legi slation takes is determined by the legislator, who, of course, remains at liberty to amend legislative proposals. The Commission does not view its RIAs as substitutes for the need for politi cal decisions, but rather as something that helps inform the debate, especially within the Commission. The overall aim is the production of better quality legislation. When the EP or Council ame nds proposals, there is recognition that further RIA work is required if the amendments are substantial. Through the Interinstitutional Agreement between the EP, Council and the Commission, the EP and the Council have committed to such further analytical work when it is needed. The Commission's RIA first and foremost serv es to help the Comm ission draft proposals that take account of sound analysis. In practice an RIA that produces a 'preferred option' should base that decision on what the most efficient opt ion is in terms of its economic, social and environmental impacts, but there is no automatic link between the RIA and the final policy outcome. Also, the Commission produces RIAs for most items on the Commission's \"Work Programme,\" some of which discuss broad policy orientation and therefore contain analysis of a more general nature, without any quantitative work. The Underpinnings: Legal and Otherwise Highlighting in more detail U.S. requirements, regulatory analysis in the U.S. is required by Executive Order87 (EO) 12866 of September 30, 1993 for all significant regulatory actions 86Impact Assessment Guidelines 15 June 2005, SEC (2005) 791, page 6. 87An Executive Order, such as EO 12866, is not a law; it is issued by the President as a direction to the federal government agencies on how to conduct their business. EOs do not expire at the end of a particular Presidency; in fact, EO 12866 was issued by President Clinton. Not only does EO 12866 define in general terms the type of 73 (rules and regulations). In addi tion, more significant analysis that complies with OMB Circular A-4 is required for all economically si gnificant regulatory actions, where \"economic significance\" is primarily defined as a rule that has an impact on the economy (costs, benefits, or transfers) of greater than $100 m illion in any one year. The EO al so establishes the procedures by which OMB reviews significant proposed and final agency regul ations for compliance with Circular A-4. In addition to a review function, OMB through this EO has the ability to return rules to the agencies due to inadequate analysis. In other words, not all regulations in th e U.S. are accompanied by a regulatory impact analysis. In fact, OMB reviews approximately 600 proposed and final regul ations per year, and only roughly 10-15 percent of the re gulations are economically sign ificant. These regulations, however, are responsible for almost all of the benefits and costs of all regulations reviewed by OMB.88 To a lesser extent, various U.S. laws also re quire some aspects of regulatory analysis. For example, the National Environmental Polic y Act of 1969 (NEPA, Pub. L. No. 91-190, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321-4347) requires federa l agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their proposed regulatory actions and r easonable alternatives to those actions. To meet this requirement, federal agencies prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In addition, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act require s cost-benefit analysis of all rules imposing expenditures on state or local governments or th e private sector of greater than $100 million a year (adjusted for inflation). The \"Regulat ory Right-to-Know Act\" obliges OMB to report yearly on the total costs and bene fits of federal regulation. In addition, the Regulat ory Flexibility Act requires an impact analysis for any rule ex pected to have a significant impact on small businesses. Finally, under the Administrati ve Procedure Act of 1946 (Pub. L. No. 79-404) , which is the major statute govern ing the process by which agencies develop regulations, agencies have an obligation to provide a \"reasonable basis\" for their decisions. Although this requirement can be met without providing a complete impact analysis compliant with all aspects of OMB's Circular A-4, or EO12866, RIAs in the U.S. can be used as evidence to show that agencies did in fact provide a reasonable basis fo r their regulations. This means that analysis has a legal status significantly different from that in the EU. The EU's impact assessment system is not de termined by legal requirements. Instead, it is based on political commitments made by the Co mmission in a range of documents, e.g. the Lisbon Agenda (2000), the Gothenborg Council Conclusions, the White Paper on Governance and the Sustainable Development Strategy the New Initiative for Growth and Jobs (2005), and the Interinstitutional 'Common Approach to Impact Assessment' (2005) between the Commission, the Council and the European Pa rliament. Although different from the more legalistic basis that impact analysis enjoys in the U.S., these repeated explicit commitments mean that there is a strong political expectation on the Commission to deliver better regulation based on sound analysis. analysis required for regulations in the U.S., it also establishes the procedures under which OMB exercises oversight of the regulatory process, including reviewing regulations and developing detailed analysis guidelines such as OMB Circular A-4. 88These totals are derived from OMB's Reports to Congress on the Costs and Benefits of Federal Regulation , which present the aggregate costs and benefits of re gulations introduced in the last ten years. 74 B. The Basic Framework of Impact Assessm ents and Regulatory Impact Analyses The Commission has explicitly adopted an integrated approach, giving equal consideration to environmental, social and ec onomic impacts. Prior to the first set of IA guidelines, which were put in place in 2003, the Commission had made extensive use of single sector-type impact assessments. The integrated a pproach combined the then existing separate IA mechanisms into one RIA. The Commission has stat ed that it views the integrated approach as essential for assessing trade-offs, which was di fficult under the partial ap proach that existed before 2002. In addition, the Lisbon Agenda was ag reed to in March 2000, establishing the goal of making the EU the most dynamic, knowledge based economy in the world by 2010, and reaffirmed the EU's commitment to sustainable development.89 The Commission has structured the analytical requirements in this way because it believes that any part icular set of impacts should not take preference over othe rs, regardless of whether they are of an economic, social or environmental nature. The integrated approach ha s a stated goal of ensuring that the three \"pillars\" of sustainable development are treated and assessed on an equal basis. One of the main purposes of the RIA is to clearly identify impacts in each of the pillars, and to show any likely trade-offs between the three pillars and thus to allow for an assessment that takes all impacts into account. The U.S. approach also takes these impacts into account, but integrates environmental, economic, and social impacts within a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) or cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). Similar to the Commission' s IA guidelines, OMB Circular A-4 derives its approach from the stated goals of the Executive Order, which states that th e goal of regulation should be to maximize the net benefits to society. Circular A- 4 states that \"where all benefits and costs can be quantified and expressed in monetary units, be nefit-cost analysis pr ovides decision makers with a clear indication of the most efficient alternative, that is, the alternative that generates the largest net benefits to society.\" Circular A- 4 certainly does not precl ude an analysis from identifying, for example, environmental impact se parately. Circular A- 4, however, requires that CBA and CEA are the primary way in which analyses present results. In an analogous way, the Commission's IA guidelines do not preclude a CBA or CEA in the Circular A-4 mould; however, it specifies that the primary presenta tion of impact should separate out social, environmental, and economic impacts. In practice, however, there are often benefits (and sometimes costs) that are difficult, if not impossible, to monetize. In cases such as th is, in both the U.S. and the EU approaches there is no prejudice against costs and benefits that can not be quantified. According to Circular A-4, officials should use their professional judgmen t in deciding whether there are significant non- quantifiable costs and benefits th at could change the outcome of the analysis based on what is quantifiable. Thus, it is feasible in the U.S. that qualitative environmenta l or social (or indeed, even economic) impacts can lead to choosing an option that would not be chosen if only quantified and monetized impacts where taken into consideration. In theory therefore, the U.S. approach does not differ significan tly from the EU in considering all the potential impacts of regulation. 89Information about the EC's implementation of the Lisbon Agenda is available at http://ec.europa.eu/growthandjobs/key/index_en.htm 75 Federalism and Subsidiarity The Commission's IA guidelines require verification of the need for EU level action under the concept of subsid iarity. According to the subsidiarity principle, even in cases in which the EU has the authority to legi slate, action should be taken at the lowest level possible and only at the EU level if there is evidence that this would provide added value. A U.S. agency has an obligation under Circular A-4 to assess whether \"Federal regulation is the best solution\" and to also \"consider regulation at the St ate or local level.\"90 U.S. agencies have an additional obligati on under Executive Order 13132 of A ugust 4, 1999, to consult state and local governments when pursuing a regulati ons that may significantly impact them; for example, if a Federal re gulation pre-empts similar state level requirements. These obligations try to ensure that regulation at federal level only takes place if the federal regulation is the appropriate level of governme nt to undertake the task. Ensuring the Efficient Use of Resources The principle of proportionate analysis appl ies to the Commission's RIAs, which means that the more significant a proposal's impacts are likely to be, the more analysis is required. Due to the commitment to accompany all items th at are on the Commission' s Legislative Work Programme91 by an RIA, there is a need to ensure th at resources are used efficiently. Expending a great deal of effort on proposed policy actions that are likely to have only a small economic, social or environmental impact would be an inefficient use of limited resources. The $100 million threshold for economic signifi cance, and therefore expanded regulatory analysis in Executive Order 12866, is a type of pr oportionate analysis test as it also tries to ensure that resources are directed to those rules that have the potential to more seriously affect the U.S. economy. In addition, Circul ar A-4 also asks officials to en sure that there is a \"balance\" between thoroughness, particularly with regard to c onsidering alternatives to regulation, and \"the practical limits on your analytical capacity.\"92 However, the obligation to quantify impacts in a certain way, and to use CBA, prescribes a minimu m amount of analysis that is always required for economically significant rulemakings. It se ems that there is more discretion in the Commission's guidelines for choosing the level of analysis that an indi vidual RIA requires. Consultation The Commission's IA guidelines ask officials to consult as much and as widely as possible. It states that consulta tion should not be restricted to t hose stakeholders who are easy to engage or to experts; officials are expected to proactively identify all stakeholders and ensure that each group of stakeholders is engaged in what is the most suitable way for them. A reactive approach based on publishing a consultation on the internet and waiting for responses may not always be sufficient or appr opriate. The Commission guideli nes emphasize the importance of consultation for reducing the likelihood of ignori ng important aspects of the proposed action, and 90Circular A-4, p. 6. 91See above for a more accurate definition. 92Circular A-4, p. 7. 76 in increasing stakeholder buy-in. There is ample guidance on consul tation apart from what is in the guidelines, including minimum st andards that all services are e xpected to adhere to in their RIA work. Moreover, all consu ltations have to be published on the webportal \"your voice in Europe\" www.europa.eu.int/yourvoice/consultations/index_en.htm and stakeholders can foresee contributions by looki ng at the Commission's Legisla tive and Work Programme, which includes the publication of roadmaps outlining upcoming impact assessments. The Commission IA process also requires interservice consultation (ISC). The lead service (the service drafting the IA ) should consult with all other services that have an interest in the area. Before a proposal and the IA go into ISC, the lead service should have set up an Interservice Steering Group (ISG), which consists of all other DGs (services) that have an interest in the proposal, in order to give ample opportunity to ensure that their points of view are taken on board and to profit from their particul ar knowledge in the area. The ISG should be set up early on and will normally accompany, and thus inform, the lead service throughout the process of producing an RIA. The goal of these re quirements is to guarantee that legislation is consistent and complementary acr oss the Directorates-General. Consultation requirements are not specifical ly spelled out in Circular A-4, but are governed by other statutory and OMB requirement s. For example, the U.S. Administrative Procedure Act established the \"notice and commen t\" rulemaking process, where all regulations (not only significant regulations) and their analyses must generally be first published in proposed form in order to give the public a chance to comment. The public can find all regulations currently out for comment on the website http:// www.regulations.gov . OMB also put in place guidelines establishing requirement s for the peer review of influential scientific documents before they are disseminated by the agency. There is a general obligation for U.S. agencies to use high quality information and expert advice if appropriate. Circular A- 4 states that \"Consultation can be useful in ensuring that your analysis addresses all of the relevant issues and that you have access to all pertinent data.\" Also, Executive Order 12866 states that, \"[e]ach agency sh all avoid regulations th at are inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative with its other regulat ions or those of other Federal agencies.\" Agencies with knowledge or a stake in another agency's regulation will review the rule during the OMB review process, and often pa rticipate during rule development. Accounting for International Impacts Legislation and regulations passed in the EU or the U.S. can often have a significant impact on third country exporters to the U.S./EU markets, and affect the conditions under which home country firms compete with external producers. Th e Commission impact assessment guidelines require all impacts to be assessed, regardless of where they are likely to occur. In addition, the annex to the Commission Guidelines specifically asks for impacts on international trade and relations, and impacts on th ird countries or international agreements, to be taken into account.93 Among other things, this requires an a ssessment of whether the proposal places EU companies at an advantage or disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis external competitors, whether consumer 93 Annex to IA Guidelines,pages 29 and 33 77 demand will shift away from po lluting industries or how trade and cross-border investment will be affected. The Commission is committed to promoting sustainable development at home and abroad. When negotiating international trade agre ements a so-called Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment (Trade SIA) is carried out by DG Tr ade. Trade SIAs may build on a previous RIA carried out in relation to prep aring the EU negotiating mandate. They aim to: provide an in- depth assessment of likely changes caused by the trade agreement on economies, social development and the environment in any poten tially affected geographical area; provide information to help clarify trade-offs derived from trade liberalisation and the limits of trade negotiating positions; build an open process of consultation around trade policy creating a basis for an informed discussion with a broad range of stakeholders; improve the EU's institutional and political dialogue on sustainable development with its trad ing partners; shed light on how trade policy can contribute to internationally agreed proces ses on sustainable development, in particular the Millennium Development Goal s and the targets set by the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg; and propose ex-post monitoring measures to be put in place during the trade agreement's implementation.94 In a bit of a contrast, Circular A-4 states that a regulatory impact analysis \"should focus on benefits and costs that accrue to citi zens and residents of the United States.\"95 Although analyzing the impacts to non-citi zens or residents is often under taken, analyzing the impact on foreign entities not directly conducting business in the U.S. economy is not required by the Circular.96 Circular A-4 also states that transfers (monetary payments from one group to another that do not affect total resources available to society) between foreign and domestic producers or consumers should be considered costs and benefi ts of a rulemaking. If the transfer occurred between domestic entities, only th e net change in the total surplu s should be counted as a real cost or benefit to society. In practice, U.S. Regulatory Impact Anal yses often acknowledge that many direct impacts on foreign entities are passed on to the U.S. economy, and these impacts should be taken into account. For example, if a regulation raises the cost of importing a product, and therefore raises domestic prices, the costs to domestic co nsumers or intermediate producers due to those price increases should be consider ed in the impact analysis. Depending on market structure, a significant portion of the direct cost of the rulemaking imposed on foreign entities may be felt in the U.S. economy. Therefore, an analysis of the direct costs on foreign en tities is often a useful if conservative proxy of the costs on the U.S. ec onomy, and many U.S. analyses incorporate this approach in order not to underestim ate the costs of their rulemakings. 94 Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment handbook, p. 12. See: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2006/march/tradoc_127974.pdf 95 Circular A-4, p. 15. 96 Note that Circular A-4 makes no distinctions between foreign or domestic firms operating in the U.S. For example, in the U.S. Department of Transportation's ru lemakings establishing corp orate average fuel economy standards, the impacts on foreign firms such as Toyota are analyzed in an identical manner as the impacts on domestic firms such as General Motors. In addition, if agencies, OMB, or the U.S. Trade Representative have a concern that a regulation may act as a non-tariff barrier, the agency will conduct a trade impact analysis likely similar to the analysis required by the IA guidelines. Circ ular A-4 is not explicit about the form this analysis may take. 78 C. Key Elements of Regulatory Impact Analysis The Commission's IA Guidelines specify that an RIA should consist of the following sections: 1) identification of the problem, 2) de finition of the objectives, 3) development of the main policy options, 4) analysis of their impacts, 5) comparison of the options and 6) an outline of how the policy will be monitored and evaluated. The introduction to the OMB Circular A-4 takes a similar approach; a good regulatory analysis consists of 1) a statement of the need for propos ed action, 2) an examination of alternative approaches and 3) an evaluation of the costs and benefits - quantitative and qualitative - of the proposed action and the main alternatives. A notable difference in emphasis in the guidelines is that Circular A-4 states that the evaluation of costs and benefits is not restricted to the preferred option but is required for all reasonable alternatives - indeed, there is an expe ctation that CBA will be done for more than one policy option. While the Commissi on guidelines also clearly suppor t this CBA approach, it is often limited to the preferred option, with a less fully developed CBA being produced for the other options when it becomes clear that an option is not as effici ent as other alternatives. Both guidelines specify that analyses should de velop a baseline scenario against which all other options have to be compared. However, comparing other options against the no-change option in the U.S. means that the costs and be nefits of the baseline option are quantified and projected into the future. This requirement is less pronounced in the Commission guidelines, where often a qualitative assessment that concludes that existing problems are likely to remain is sufficient, although the guidelines do state the need to look at how the problem is likely to evolve over time. The baselines scenario as understood in the Commission RIA system does include taking into account developments such as existing policies alrea dy decided and in the pipeline, and predictable technological progress. Part of the goal the IA is to show that another option would lead to net social benef its vis-\u00e0-vis the baselin e option. If the IA cannot show that, the baseline option should be the preferred option. Circular A-4 does not obligate RIAs to exam ine a certain number of options, and a U.S. agency is allowed to dismiss some options without much analytical work if they are clearly not genuine options. There is an expecta tion that serious an alysis is done on several alternatives. The Commission's RIA is expe cted to look into a range of options, usually three to five in total. An important difference, however , is that the alternatives av ailable and expected to be considered in the EU are often wider in scope than in the U.S. The term \"regulatory alternatives\" is used in the U.S., whereas th e Commission guidelines discuss \"alternatives to regulation.\" The Commission guide lines state, and strongly reco mmend, that all analyses should consider alternatives to regul ation, such as co- an d self-regulation or other market based implementation instruments, within the impact assessment. Typical alternative regulatory approaches in the U.S. may incl ude some Commission \"alternatives to regulation,\" but others are narrower in scope than what typi cally would be considered a Co mmission alternative, such as different compliance dates, levels of stringenc y, enforcement methods an d different requirements for small firms. This is almost certainly due to the wider scope of the legislative and regulatory 79 actions covered by the Commission guidelines. Re member that the scope of a U.S. regulatory agency to consider non-regulatory alternatives is limited by the authority granted by previous statutes (or primary legislat ion). For example, although resource-based taxes are often considered a viable theoretical alternative to direct pollution regulati on, the EPA does not have the statutory authority to impose taxes to meet their regulatory objectives.97 Both Circular A-4 and the Impact Assessmen t guidelines have transparency as a major goal. Circular A-4 states that third parties should be able to se e clearly how estimates of costs and benefits are arrived at and be able to reproduce any calculations with the information that is given in the impact assessme nt. The Commission gui delines state that the analysis and conclusions should be transparent to a non-specialist and clearly presente d in a standardized format. Both guidelines require th at analyses use clear language that does not obfuscate results. Reasons for Intervention Almost every regulation is an intervention in the functioning of markets. Markets are generally efficient, but sometimes fail in a way that intervention, includi ng regulation, may be able to address. Both guidel ines discuss externalities, public goods, and inadequate or asymmetric information as typical market failures that may require intervention. In addition, both systems allow for intervention on the grounds of other compel ling public needs, such as distributional equity and fairness, or rectifying other undesirable social outcomes. Regardless of the need for the intervention, both guidelines state that the rationale should be clearly presented and as concrete as possible. While there is a great deal of similarity on the rationale for intervention between the two systems, the identification of the market failure argument appears to be given more prominence in Circular A-4 in the U.S. Circular A-4 presents a fuller di scussion of the types of market failures that regulations may addr ess, and includes the direction that agencies should have a presumption against \"economic regulation,\" or using such regulatory mechanisms as price and wage controls or entry restrictions to accomplish their regulatory objectives. The Commission's IA guideline s, however, have a full discussion of how to frame a problem well, or in such a way that it lends itself to appropriate policy alternatives. For instance, the guidelines suggest a problem tree approach, which maps out major problems and how they relate to each other. The IA gui delines state that this is a usef ul tool for focusing on the core problem that actually needs to be addressed by a regulation. The slight difference in emphasis between th e two approaches to discussing the reasons for an intervention may be due to the wider applicab ility of the IA guidelines. By its nature, for example, primary legislation may also address issues that lend themselves less to a categorization into what economists would consid er classic market failures. 97We should note that EO 12866 does require agencies to \"identify and assess available alternatives to direct regulation, including providing economic incentives to encourage the desired behavior, such as user fees or marketable permits, or providing information upon which choices can be made by the public.\" 80 D. Analytical Methods As stated above, Circular A- 4 states that the evaluation of how best to achieve the objectives of a regulation is done within the framework of cost-b enefit and cost effectiveness analysis (CBA and CEA respectively). Circular A-4 gives considerable detail on how to use the two methods. The Commission's guidelines, on th e other hand, see CBA and CEA as valuable methodologies that can add value when assessing likely impacts, but they are not compulsory and a qualitative analysis is ofte n equally acceptable. In practi ce, however, almost all regulatory impact analyses in the U.S. and the EU w ill contain both qualitative and quantitative components. The Commission guidelines provi de greater guidance on the sp ecific impacts particular regulations may have and direct orates should consider. For ex ample, it provides an impacts menu tool, which is \"meant as an aid for you to use in developing your thinking about a wider range of potential impacts for the policy options.\"98 This reasoning behind the menu approach chosen by the Commission to identifying impacts may be twofold. It tries to take account of the various limitations of these types of analysis, wher e obstacles such as a lack of data often allow for only partial monetization or quantification. Mo reover, the proportionate analysis criterion of the Commission guidelines often limits the amount of effort that should be expended on an RIA that analyzes a policy with a relatively small impact, which can favor qualit ative analysis since it is generally less resource intense. Both guidelines stress that analysis should be proportional to the size and importance of the re gulation; therefore, in practice both guidelin es support greater analytical rigor when it is especial ly relevant for decision making. However, in spite of the absence of an obligation to quantifyi ng and monetizing where possible, there is of course recognition in the Commission that public funds have to be used in accordance with sound financial management, and that private mandates should be imposed only when necessary and that they should be efficient. Interventions should therefore be achieved in a cost efficient manner. The Commission guidelines state that efficiency goals of an intervention are met \"if its set of objectives are achieved at le ast cost, or if its desired impact is maximized at a given level of resources.\"99 For highly focused regulatory pr oposals (those that are likely to have significant economic, social or environmental impacts and where good data exists), using CBA and/or CEA techniques is common and encouraged. CBA and CEA Circular A-4 states th at CBA should be carried out for a ll rulemakings and for all options considered in a regulatory analysis. Moreover, overall as well as incremental costs and benefits have to be calculated. Agencies are not entirely free in their choi ce of how to do CBAs as there is some requirement for consistency across regulati ons. Circular A-4 introd uces the tools of CBA and CEA, such as opportunity cost, willingness to pay and accept, contingent valuation and 98IA guidelines, p. 28 99Moreover, the same page in the guidelines states that \"all proposals with financial implications for the Community budget must also be accompanied by a legislative financ ial statement that includes a detailed calculation of the financial and human resources to be allocation to the intervention\" (IA guidelines, p. 26). 81 revealed preference, Quality Adjusted Life Y ears, discount rates, etc. and discusses their limitations. The main feature of a CBA is that costs and benefits are expressed in monetary terms to the extent feasible, which allows for a direct comparison and evaluation of the different policy options. This policy represents a significantly stronge r reliance on CBA than that adopted by the Commission. Taking the net benefit measure as the evaluation indi cator may favor options with large costs as long as they are exceeded by high benefit estimates . This is a contrast to the Commission approach, which is perhaps more lik ely to dismiss an option that has what it considers to be unacceptably high costs, re gardless of the overall net benefit. The Commission guidelines are clearer in stat ing that a qualitative approach to impact assessment is appropriate in many circumstances. This may be a reflection of the difference in purpose of RIAs compared with the U.S., and recognition that CBA for a broad policy outline would not be sensible in the EU. It also, however, may reflect a slight difference in the perceived limitations of quantitative analysis in the two systems. Circular A-4, although requiri ng CBA if feasible, recognizes that monetized CBA, in practice, is not the only consideration in a deci sion, as many costs and benefits simply cannot be monetized. The U.S. official is encouraged to qu antify where possible in such instances, and if that is not possible to present a qualitative discussi on of the costs and benefits . In situations such as this Circular A-4 encourages a \"threshold\" or \"break-even\" analysis. This analysis answers the following question, \"How small could the va lue of the non-quantified benefits be (or how large would the value of the non-qua ntified costs need to be) before the rule would yield zero net benefits?\" In addition to threshol d analysis, Circular A-4 states that the agency \"should indicate, where possible, which non-quantified eff ects are most important and why.\" In addition, Circular A-4 enc ourages CEA for all rules and requires it for rules in which the primary benefit is an improveme nt in health or safety. In CEA, a set of regulatory actions with the same outcome(s) is compared (e.g. construction of an index of units of health improvement). CEA should lead to the identifica tion of the most efficient way of achieving a regulatory outcome in the absence of complete monetization of benefits . Circular A-4 gives considerable detail on pitfalls and things that have to be kept in mi nd for making CEA successful - for example, the need to look at incremental cost-effectiveness and how to construct the cost- effectiveness ratios. Circular A-4 encourages the use of an integrated measure of effectiveness, such as Quality Adjusted Life Years, but does not take a position on what measure of health improvement or other unit of benefit to use, stating that lives saved, life years saved, or a measure such as Quality Adjusted Life Years ma y all lend a useful pers pective to the decision- makers. CEA is a relatively new requirement for RI As, and the U.S. Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences r ecently published a report titled \"V aluing Health for Regulatory Cost-Effectiveness Analysis\" that studies the issue in more detail.100 The Commission guidelines stress that CEA offers a good alternative to CBA, particularly in cases in which the full monetizati on of all costs and benefi ts is not possible. It explains that CEA leads one to calculate the co sts of a desired outcome for several options and 100This report is available at http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3809/19739/32029.aspx 82 allows one to rank them based on \"cost per unit of effectiveness.\" According to the guidelines CEA can be useful when several options all lead to more or less the same outcome. It is clear that Circular A-4 itself gives more detail as regards, for example, CBA and CEA than the Commission guidelines do. This is , of course, a reflection of the stronger requirement for CBA/CEA that exists in the U.S. system, which is at least partly a reflection of the slightly different purposes the two RIA systems fulfill. A simple comparison of the proportion of U.S. and EU RIAs that use quant itative analysis may be misleading, however, since RIAs in the EU are prepared for a wider range of general policy documents for which quantification is often not possible. For po licy proposals that are likely to have significant impacts, the level of detailed qua ntitative analysis, and hence the use of CBA, CEA, etc, may be more comparable than such an analysis would imply. Administrative Costs101 Measuring the likely administra tive costs of legislation is a requirement unique to the Commission's IA guidelines, alt hough Circular A-4 would consider any impacts of this nature legitimate costs and would require their analysis.102 The Commission has recently developed a model for measuring net administrative costs.103 These costs can be a considerable burden on business, voluntary organizations and the public sector. Th ey tend to affect small to medium size enterprises (SMEs) more than larger organiza tions, and can pose a serious hindrance to a competitive, productive and innovative economic environment. Given the commitments the Commission made in Lisbon 2000 to making th e EU the most dynamic, knowledge-based economic area by 2010, their potential to we igh down economic progress by slowing down productivity growth and innovati on can be directly at odds with overall Commission policy. The other side of the coin is that data collection, labeling of products and so on often fulfils a very useful and necessary requirement. One only n eeds to think about the confidence consumers would have in unlabelled products or imagine a worl d without data collection. In order to strike a balance between the necessity and usefulness of labeling and data collection on the one hand, and ensuring a competitive market economy framewor k on the other, it is e ssential to be aware of administrative costs that a given piece or legislation is likely to cause. The Commission guidelines suggest measuri ng administrative costs by multiplying the average cost of an action (price ) by the total number of actions performed (quantity). The core equation is the following: P x Q (Price = tariff x time; Quantity = no. of businesses x frequency) 101\"Administrative costs are defined as the costs incurred by enterprises, the voluntary sector, public authorities and citizens in meeting legal obligations to provide information on their action or production, either to public authorities or to private parties. Information is to be taken in ab road sense, including costs of labelling, reporting, and monitoring to provide the information and registration.\" (Annexes to guidelines, p. 35) 102In addition, the U.S. does require a separate analysis of the \"paperwork burden\" of regulations and, more generally, information collections, under the Paperwork Reduc tion Act, which was discussed in more detail above. OMB also tracks and reports to Congress yearly on the total paperwork burden imposed by U.S. agencies. This process and analysis, however is not covered in Circular A-4. 103Net administrative costs are defined as: costs introduced by the legislation minus the costs suppressed by legislation at EU and/or national level. 83 The tariff is based on labor cost and overheads, which are normally the main cost factors of meeting administrative obligations. Since the recent amendment to the guidelines, taking account of administrative costs has been made obligatory. However, these costs were also taken into consideration for some of the most far-reaching IAs the Commission has done so far. In the RIA supporting the REACH104 proposal, the administrative costs of each man-da y required for meeting the obligations were calculated to be EUR 1000. This figure includes overheads which in the case of chemical laboratory work can be quite substantial. Required Parameter Values For the most part, neither document requires that analyses use pa rticular values for parameters of interest. The two exceptions are the value of risk and discount rates. First, Circular A-4 discusses the methods and economic re search on the value i ndividuals place on risk reduction in some detail. The guidelines do not come to a definitive conclusion on a specific value, but they do recommend a range . Circular A-4 states that \"A substantial majority of the resulting estimates of VSL (the \"value of a stat istical life\", or the monetized value of small changes in fatality risk that when summed up eq ual one life saved) vary from roughly $1 million to $10 million per statistical life.\"105 In practice, these values are widely used in U.S. RIAs in many different regulatory contex ts that involve small changes in risk. Circular A-4 also discusses the value agencies may place on interventi ons that change the risks faced by children. Although research on this point is inconclusive, Circ ular A-4 states that ag encies should place at least as high a value on a child's statistical risk as they do to an equivalent risk faced by an adult. The Commission guidelines discuss VSL in th e context of environmental policy. They recommend a value of \u20ac1.0 million ($1.3 million at the exchange rate current as of the draft of this appendix) as a best estimate when monetizing benefits, and between \u20ac0.65 ($.85) million and \u20ac2.5 ($3.25) million as upper and lower bounds in sensitivity analysis. The Commission guidelines state that these figures are \"applicable to deaths in a largely elderly population where the reduction in life expectancy is likely to be short - maybe one year or less.\"106 They are not the default choice when monetizi ng the value of life. Depending on the individual case, different methodologies have been used within the Co mmission, bearing in mind the relatively low number of EU RIAs that have attempted moneti zation in the context of value of life. The Commission guidelines support monetization of this type, stating that \"[a]ny decision in this context means placing an implicit monetary valu e on health benefits. Decision-making will be easier and become more consistent if we have a monetary estimate of the value of health benefits. The monetary value represents the strengths of so ciety's preferences.\"107 Both Circular 104The European Commission has proposed a new EU re gulatory framework for chemicals called REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restricti on of Chemicals). More information is available at: http://ec.europa.eu/ente rprise/reach/index_en.htm 105 Circular A-4, p. 30. 106 IA guidelines, p. 38 107Commission Guidelines Annexes, p. 38 84 A-4 and the Commission guideline s are clear that these valu es are only applicable to interventions resulting in small changes in risk.108 Both guidelines also specify discount rates which should be used in all impact analyses to adjust benefits and costs when they do not take place in the same time period. The Commission guidelines state that all analyses should use a discount rate of 4 percen t, while Circular A-4 requires that all analyses use disc ount rates of both 3 per cent and 7 percent. Both are real rates of return, which means that they do not include inflation, which should be accounted for with an expected inflation rate. The Co mmission guidelines state that 4 percent \"broadly corresponds to the average real yield on longe r-term government debt in the EU over a period since the early 1980s.\"109 Circular A-4 provides a de tailed discussion of the rationa le for the different discount rates. The 7 percent rate approximates the average before-tax rate of return to private capital in the U.S. economy, and represents the opportunity cost of capital in the U.S. Circular A-4 states, however, that when regulation primarily and di rectly affects private consumption, a lower discount rate is appropriate. The alternative most often used is sometimes called the social rate of time preference, which may be fairly approximated by the historical real rate of return on long term government debt, which is around 3 percent.110 Thus, the rationale for Circular A-4's lower rate of return also applies to th e Commission's required rate of retu rn of 4 percent. Circular A-4 requires both rates for all analysis, because it is often difficult to determine whether regulatory costs primarily displace private capital or private consumption. Uncertainty Analysis Both guidelines discuss uncertainty analys is. Specifically, the Commission guidelines state that \"it is important to re member that in some cases, the level of uncertainty may be too high to make precise quantified estimates. In these cases, ranges of plausibl e values or different scenarios should be given...\"111 The guidelines provide a brief introduction outlining the importance of dealing with uncertainty by analyz ing its potential impacts. For more detail on how to do this type of work and techniques, th e Commission guidelines pr ovide a web link to the Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC).112 Circular A-4 requires agencies to characterize in some way the uncertainty inherent in the analysis. \"The import ant uncertainties connected with 108Techniques such as VSL measure the willingness to accept or not to accept slight increases in mortality risk, and are not applicable to large changes in risk. 109Commission Guidelines Annexes, p. 39. Essentially, the Commission believes that the average rate of return on government bonds should be the only proxy used as it mo re accurately reflects the o pportunity cost of public investments. The U.S. argues that the opportunity cost is more accurately refl ected by the private sector rate of return, but that the private personal time preference may be approximated by the same government bond returns recommended by the Commission. The U.S. uses two discount rates reflecting these two different opportunity costs. 110The SRTP is calculated in the following way: r - + g, where r - SRTP, - discount rate of future consumption over present consumption with no change in per capita consumption, -elasticity of marginal utility of consumption with respect to utility, g - annual growth in per ca pita consumption. Studies have shown the value for to lie between 1.0 and 1.6 (e.g. OXERA 2002), for to be around 1 with a range of +/- 0.3-0.5 (e.g. OXERA 2002; Cowell and Gardiner 199; Pearce and Ulph 1995). A good estimate of g is generally around 2-2.5% (e.g. various studies, for UK Madison 2001). When substituting these values into the equation one obtains r - 3-4%. 111Commission guidelines, pp. 37-38. 112http://sensitivity-analysis.irc.cec.eu.int The JRC is an institution that all Commission services (the DGs) can draw on for expertise, particularly on the use of quantitative techniques such as sensitivity analysis 85 your regulatory decisions need to be analyzed an d presented as part of the overall regulatory analysis.\"113 In both cases, the analysis often takes the form of sensitivity analysis of one or more important or particularly uncertain parameters . The Commission guidelin es identify sensitivity analysis as an especially useful and relative ly easy approach. The Comm ission guidelines may be understood as encouraging a discussion of both va riability\u2014uncertainty fo r which probabilities or distribution functions exist\u2014 and uncertainty, for which no proba bilities are available. As both normally go hand in hand, obtaining a good idea of those uncerta inties with known probabilities alone is not enough. Dealing with uncertainties without known probabilities generally requires a case-by-case or scenario approach, often comp rising a qualitative approach describing different plausibl e scenarios. The application of uncer tainty analysis in the EU is of course also subject to the propor tionate analysis criterion. Circ ular A-4, however, goes further with specific requirements: for rules involving annual impacts of $1 billion or more, Circular A- 4 requires agencies to conduct what the guidanc e calls a \"formal quantita tive analysis\" of the relevant uncertainties about benefits and costs. In practice, this will often take the form of a Monte-Carlo analysis, which assu mes a distribution around many of the uncertain variables in order to estimate an uncertainty interval ar ound net benefits. For rules with annual impacts under $1 billion, the guidance does not require as in-depth an analys is, and in practice sensitivity analysis is probably the most co mmon approach. Circular A-4 also encourages, similar to the Commission guidance, a scenario approach to discussing uncertainty where the agency cannot estimate the probability of a particular impact. Future Monitoring and Evaluation of Programs The Commission's guidelines stipulate that an RIA has to include information on how achieving the policy objectives will be monitored. There is a sp ecific requirement for evaluating the effectiveness of expenditure programs, incl uding generating data on the basis of carefully designed indicators.114 The RIA itself must discuss the method by which a program will collect data or how its effectiveness afte r implementation will be verified. Although this is an important part of the RIA, the guidelines recognize that th e final form that evaluation and monitoring takes can only be determined after the proposal has been through the Council and Parliament. Officials are therefore required \"to provide a broad outline of possible mon itoring\" and \"...evaluation arrangements\" and to identify core progress indicators.115 The evaluation and monitoring requirements in the Commission's IA system has a goal of providing policymakers with a way of verifying whether a policy is achieving its objectives. Many of the indicators that are needed for expenditure programs can also be applied to regulatory proposals. A distincti on is made in terms of output s between expenditure programs and purely regulatory (policy) proposals, and the Commission gui delines acknowledge that it can be much more difficult to devel op indicators for the latter. For example, if money is spent on building a road, it is relatively easy to come up with indicators, e.g. miles of road build after x months. For a Directive, however, this is mo re difficult: transposition into national law or 113Circular A-4, p. 38. 114Commission guidelines, p. 45. 115Ibid, p. 45; with italics by authors. 86 adoption by the European Parliament cannot be cons idered an as output. The guidelines suggest that \"outputs at EU level coul d in such a case be based on a typology of the 'key types of measures' adopted by the Member States in order to comply with the Direc tive.\" Any indicators in this context should be \"RACER : relevant, accepted; credible, eas y to monitor and robust.\" There is no equivalent requirement for an RI A to include performance indicators, or for post implementation validation or effectiveness an alysis in the U.S. under Circular A-4 or EO 12866. Often the effects of regulations in the U.S. will be validated by outside parties, or will be re-evaluated in the context of adopting regulatory reforms, but there is no proactive requirement. In the 2005 Report to Congress on the Cost s and Benefits of Federal Regulation,116 OMB studied the extent to which the ex-ante regulatory analysis published by agencies before a rule is finalized are validated for their ac curacy after the rule has been put in place. OMB found that only a small fraction of the rules reviewed by OMB before publication have been validated ex- post. The only proactive requirement in the U. S. for post-regulatory analysis is under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Sec tion 610, which obliges agencies to revisit the regulations they passed that significantly impact small businesses. This analysis must take place within 10 years following the original final rule; the analysis ne ed not be quantitative and the agency is not required to consider changing a regulation as a result of this review , even if the review concluded that the regulation is no t acting as intended. E. Conclusion This section began by stressing the different purposes the two RIA systems serve and hence the function the two sets of guidelines perform. Due to the differences in the legislative systems, or more specifically how laws and regula tions are made, impact analysis is produced at different stages in the process. In the U.S., an RIA is produced by an agency tasked by Executive Order 12866 with implementing laws or primary legi slation in the most cost-beneficial way. The formal OMB Circular A-4 applie s to \"economically significant\" proposed and final rules whose annual costs or benefits are likely to exceed th e threshold of U.S. $100 million. Since agencies have a statutory obligation to show that proposed regulation has a reasonab le basis, U.S. RIAs may be drawn upon in court cases. The Commission's RIAs fulfill the purpose of providing additional information internally and to policy makers on its regulat ory or legislative proposals, a nd are prepared for almost all items on its legislative and work program. Alt hough external parties also use the RIAs, e.g. the European Parliament and the Council of the Eur opean Union, they are prepared as an input for internal Commission political decision-making. T hus, in the EU decisi on making process the final legislative product may be less strongly linked to the Commission RIA, bearing in mind that the Parliament and Council are committed to conducting additional impact analysis of substantial amendments they propose. Moreover, the Commission prepares RIAs for a variety of documents and general policy orientation proposals that do not require RIAs in the U.S. system. Hence, one may conclude that the Commission gui delines have to be more flexible and less prescriptive in its analytical requirements than Circular A-4, in order to apply in a meaningful way to work program items that are of a more general nature. 116Available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/o mb/inforeg/regpol-reports_congress.html 87 These differences manifest themselves in the le vel of detailed advice that is given in both sets of guidelines on quan titative analysis. In the U.S., there clearly is a stronge r obligation to do cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and cost-effectiveness anal ysis (CEA) of an economically significant proposed regulatory action and a reasonable set of alternative regulatory approaches. This must not be confused, however with ther e being no demands for detailed CBA (or CEA) for Commission proposals of similar economic, social and environm ental impacts as the U.S. $100 million threshold. The Commission guidelines cl early state that proportionate analysis is required, which by implication means more detailed, and thus often more quant itative, analysis if the likely impacts are sufficiently large. A defining feature of the Comm ission RIA system is the inte grated approach, taking into account all economic, social and environmenta l impacts. The U.S. does take account of economic, social, and environmental impacts, but within a CBA framework. Concluding from this that the U.S. IA system is biased agains t impacts that cannot be quantified, whereas the Commission pays more attention to these impact s, perhaps at the expe nse of quantification, might however be misleading. There is an obliga tion in the U.S. guidelines to take account of non-quantifiable impacts and to provide thorough quali tative analysis. In reality, the differences in the guidelines regarding the ability of the two systems to take account of qualitative impacts and to conduct quantitative analysis may be less straight forward than often thought. Hence, one may conclude that while many similarities exist, there are significant differences, particularly as regards the legal a nd institutional framework, the resulting different stages at which RIAs are produced, and the differe nce in purpose they serve in the two systems. Carrying out one ex-ante RIA that can be shared by U.S. re gulators and the Commission at this moment in time may be challenging. Sharing th e same sources of information, making sure the basis of each analytical appr oach is sound, and building on e ach analysis based on a better understanding of the other's system are likely to produce better real re sults in the area of regulatory cooperation. The next step in this line of analysis may include a more detailed investigation into how these differences or similarities in the guidelines translate into practice, or rather how Impact Assessments and Regulatory Impact Analyses co mpare that analyze impacts of a comparable policy or regulatory initiative. It should hope fully be clear from this appendix that such an investigation cannot simply compare the proportion of analyses that quantify impacts, evaluate adequate alternatives, or perform sensitivity analysis in the two systems, but rather would have to respect the different systems, as expressed by, for example, the different proportionality criteria, the narrower applicability of the U.S. Circular, and the relatively short time that the Commission Impact Assessment guidance has been in place. 88 APPENDIX E: UPDATE ON 2001, 2002, AND 2004 REGULATORY REFORM NOMINATIONS The Regulatory Right-to-Know Act require s OMB to publish \"recommendations for reform\" (Pub. L. No. 106-554, App. C, \u00a7 624(a)(3)). During the Bush Administration, OMB has responded to this requirement by requesting that the public identify candidates for reform. We solicited nominations for reform in 2001, 2002, and 2004. In previous Reports, OMB has provided periodic updates on these important regulatory reform initiatives. We are doing so again in this Final Report. This Report's update includes the final progre ss report that we will issue for the 2001 and 2002 regulatory reforms. To allow the pub lic to obtain further updates on 2001 and 2002 reforms underway, Table E-5 provides contact info rmation for each agency with responsibility for addressing the reforms listed in Tables E-2 and E-3. A. 2001 Regulatory Reform Nominations In the draft version of the 2001 Report, OMB asked for suggestions from the public about specific regulations that should be modified to increase net benef its to the public. We received suggestions regarding 71 regulations. In an initial review of the comments, OMB placed the suggestions into three categories: high pr iority, medium priority, and low priority.117 As we did in OMB's 2004 Final Report, we are providing updates on the high and medium priority nominations. While the 2001 call for nominations rece ived responses from fewer than 50 organizations, the 2002 process was far more ambitious and resulted in almost 1,700 nominations. For this reason, and because one year does not allow time for significant regulatory change, many 2001 nominations were re proposed in 2002. For these regulations, we have provided cross-references to the 2002 nomi nations listed in Table E-2.

OCC/FDIC/ OTS Federal Reserve Second Consultative Package on the New Basel Capital Accord Medium Decided not to pursue. CFTC Multilateral Transaction Execution Facilities, Intermediaries and Clearing Organizations; Exemption for Bilateral Transactions Medium The agency believes that the nomination concerns a set of final rules that the Commission issued on December 13, 2000 (65 FR 77961 (December 13, 2000). Due to the enactme nt of statutory revisions to the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (\"CFMA\") on December 21, 2000, the Commission largely withdrew those final rules, with the exception of amendments to the Commission's rule concerning investment of customer and conforming amendments to related rules 65 FR 82272 (December 28, 2000)). Notably, the CFMA largely codified in the CEA the framework that the December 13, 2000, rulemaking would have imposed on trading facilities, intermediaries, and clearing organizations and bilateral transactions. 90 Table E-1: 2001 Regulatory Reform Nominations Agency Title of Reform OMB Priority Status CFTC Fast-track Designation and Rule Approval Procedures Medium The agency believes that the nomination concerns fast-track procedures for Commission review of new and amended exchange contracts, rules, and rule amendments adopted by the Commission in March 1997 ( 62 FR 10427 and 10434). The suggestion that the Commi ssion consider a multi- tier pricing structure, in cluding lower contract application fees, has been obviated by the self- certification provision of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended by the CFMA. CEA Section 5c(c)(2). Under that provision, contract markets may implement new contracts, rules and rule amendments with a simple, cost-free, self-certified submission to the Commission. The vast majority of contracts, ru les and rule amendments are so implemented by contract markets.

FSIS has evaluated data from the volunteer system and may use that data to develop a proposed rule to establish a new inspection system. Agriculture Zero Tolerance for Listeria monocytogenes and Performance Standards 5 Reform Underway. FSIS published an interim final rule, \"Control of Listeria monocytogenes in Ready-to-Eat (RTE) Meat and Poultry Products\" (68 FR 34208), on June 6, 2003. FSIS is completing an analysis of the economic impact of the rule and expects to be in a position to affirm the interim rule as a final rule in the first part of 2007. 118For a detailed explanation of OMB's review of the 2002 nominations, see Informing Regulatory Decisions: 2003 Report to Congress on the Costs and Benefits of Federal Regulations and Unfunded Mandates on the State, Local, and Tribal Entities , pp. 21-23, available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/2003_cost-ben_final_rpt.pdf. 92 Table E-2: 2002 Regulatory Reform Nomination Status Agency Title of Reform Ref.

In response to the solicitation, OMB received 189 nominations. OMB a nd the agencies evaluated the nominations, and in March 2005, OMB issued the Regulatory Reform of the U.S. Manufacturing Sector Report.119 In this report, we determined that 76 of the 189 nominations should be priorities, and also identified milestones and deadlines. OMB continues to work closely with the re gulatory agencies responsible for each of these reforms, and the agencies continue to ma ke progress. Table E-4 below provides a further item-by-item update of the status of the regulatory reforms. The table indicates that 40 of the 76 reform items are now complete as of October 2006.

The United States Trade Representative (USTR) is leading an initiative to further simplify NAFTA requirements under the Strategy for Peace and Prosperity, a cooperative effort of the Governments of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. 119This report is available at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/ reports/manufacturing_initiative.pdf 113 Table E-4: 2004 Manufacturing Regulatory Reform Nomination Status # Reform Name Nominator Agency Promised Action Date Status 7 Maritime Security American Shipbuilding Association (44) DHS Coast Guard Report to OMB May-05 Complete. Report submitted to OMB in May, 2005. The report noted that Department of Defense (DOD) security plan requirements may not be sufficient for the purposes of the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) regulations for shipyards, because DOD plans generally do not cover non-DOD work at a facility. The report also noted, however, that the Coast Guard will consider waiving MTSA requirements in cases where the DOD plan is found to be equivalent to a plan required under MTSA. The Navy and the Coast Guard will continue to work together to ensure that effective security measures are in place for protecting shipyards that do not impose unnecessary or duplicative burdens on the affected Federal and private sector parties. 12 Motor Vehicle Brakes National Association of Manufacturers (9); National Marine Manufacturers Association (38) DOT FMCSA Proposed Rule Sep-05 Complete.

Of the 197 forms EPA determined were being used to collect information from the public, 96% are currently being made available to the public in PDF. EPA determined that it was not necessary to offer the remaining forms in electronic format, because hardcopy is the more appropriate means for these collections. These forms include such things as forms that are mailed to EPA along with physical samples, and forms used by Agency interviewers. EPA continues to work with states and other stakeholders to ease the burden of electronic reporting through initiatives such as EPA's central data exchange and SBA's e-government. 38 Expand the Comparable Fuels Exclusion (CFE) under RCRA National Association of Manufacturers (9); American Chemistry Council (31) EPA Discuss and Receive input from stakeholders Jan-06 Complete: EPA discussed and received input on this nomination from stakeholders in December, 2005. 38 Expand the Comparable Fuels Exclusion (CFE) under RCRA National Association of Manufacturers (9); American Chemistry Council (31) EPA Proposed Rule Sep-06 Overdue. 38 Expand the Comparable Fuels Exclusion (CFE) under RCRA National Association of Manufacturers (9); American Chemistry Council (31) EPA Final Rule Nov-07 Awaiting issuance of proposed rule. 118 Table E-4: 2004 Manufacturing Regulatory Reform Nomination Status # Reform Name Nominator Agency Promised Action Date Status 39 Export Notification Requirements National Association of Manufacturers (9); American Chemistry Council (31) EPA Proposed Rule Jan-06 Complete: Proposed rule published on February 9, 2006 (71 FR 6733) EPA expects to issue a final rule by the end of 2006. 42 Hazardous Waste Rules Should Be Amended to Encourage Recycling (Definition of Solid Waste) National Association of Manufacturers (9); American Petroleum Institute (12); Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association (17); National Paint and Coatings Association (18); U.S. Chamber of Commerce (19); Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (23); Specialty Graphic Imaging Association (27); American Chemistry Council (31); IPC - The Association Connecting Electronics Industries (32); SBA Office of Advocacy (39) EPA Final Rule or Re-proposal (which would be due in Winter of 2008) Nov-06 Overdue. 119 Table E-4: 2004 Manufacturing Regulatory Reform Nomination Status # Reform Name Nominator Agency Promised Action Date Status 43 Lead Reporting Burdens Under the Toxic Release Inventory National Federal of Independent Business (8); National Association of Manufacturers (9); Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association (17); National Paint and Coatings Association (18); The Policy Group (28); IPC - The Association Connecting Electronics Industries (32); The Copper and Brass Fabricators Council (45) EPA Report to OMB on the status of applying the metals framework to lead and lead compounds Sep-05 Overdue.

Robert Shull and Genevieve Smith, OMB Watch 135 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS ON AGENCY COMPLIANCE WITH THE UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM ACT 136 INTRODUCTION This report represents OMB's eleventh annual submission to Congress on agency compliance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (the Act). It details agency actions to involve State, local, and tribal governments in regulator y decisions that affect them, including expanded efforts to involve them in agency decision-making processes. As has been done in recent years, this report is being included along with our annual report to Congress on the benefits and costs of Fe deral regulations. This is done because the two reports together address many of the same issues and both highlight the ne ed for regulating in a responsible manner that accounts for the costs and be nefits of rules and ta kes into consideration the interests of our inte rgovernmental partners. As OMB stated in previous reports, we intend to continue to publish these two re ports together. This report on agency compliance with the Act covers the period of October of 2004 through Sept ember of 2005 (rules published before October of 2004 were described in last year's report.) State and local governments have a vital constitutional role in providing government services. They have the major role in providi ng domestic public serv ices, such as public education, law enforcement, road building and main tenance, water supply, and sewage treatment. The Federal government contributes to that role by promoting a healthy economy and by providing grants, loans, and tax subsidies to State and local g overnments. However, over the past two decades, State, local, and tribal gove rnments increasingly have expressed concerns about the difficulty of complying with Federal ma ndates without additional Federal resources. In response, Congress passed the Unfunded Ma ndates Reform Act of 1995 (the Act). Title I of the Act focuses on the Legislat ive Branch, addressing the processes Congress should follow before enactment of any statut ory unfunded mandates. Title II addresses the Executive Branch. It begins with a general dire ctive for agencies to assess, unless otherwise prohibited by law, the effects of their rules on the other levels of govern ment and on the private sector (Section 201). Title II also describes specific analyses a nd consultations that agencies must undertake for rules that may result in e xpenditures of over $100 million (adjusted annually for inflation) in any year by State, local, and tribal governments in the aggregate, or by the private sector. Specifically, Sect ion 202 requires an agency to prepare a written statement for intergovernmental mandates that describes in detail the require d analyses and consultations on the unfunded mandate. Section 205 requires that for all rules s ubject to Section 202, agencies must identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives, and then generally select from among them the least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome option that achieves the objectives of the rule. Exceptions re quire the agency head to explain in the final rule why such a selection was not made or why su ch a selection would be inconsistent with law. Title II requires agencies to \"develop an e ffective process\" for obtaining \"meaningful and timely input\" from State, local a nd tribal governments in developing rules that contain significant intergovernmental mandates (Section 204). Ti tle II also singles out small governments for particular attention (Section 203). OMB's guidelines assist Federa l agencies in complying with the Act and are based upon the following general principles: 137 intergovernmental consultations should take place as early as possi ble, beginning before issuance of a proposed rule and continuing throu gh the final rule stage, and be integrated explicitly into the rulemaking process; agencies should consult with a wide variet y of State, local, and tribal officials; agencies should estimate direct costs and be nefits to assist with these consultations; the scope of consultation should reflect the cost and significance of the mandate being considered; effective consultation requires tr ust and significant and sustaine d attention so that all who participate can enjoy frank discussion and focus on key priorities; and agencies should seek out State, local, and tribal views on costs, benefits, risks, and alternative methods of compliance, and whethe r the Federal rule wi ll harmonize with and not duplicate similar laws in other levels of government. The scope of consultation activities u ndertaken by Federal departments such as, Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services, Interior, Ju stice, Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency demonstrate this Administration's commitment to building strong relationships with our intergovernmental pa rtners based upon the cons titutional principles of federalism embodied in Title II of the Act. Federal agencies have been actively consulting with States, localities, and tribal governments in order to en sure that regulatory activities were conducted consistent with the requirements of th e Act. For examples of agency consultation activities, please see the appendix to this report. Sections 206 and 208 of the Act direct OMB to send copies of required agency analyses to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nd to submit an annual report to Congress on agency compliance with Title II. The remainder of this report discusses the resu lts of agency actions in response to the Act between October 1, 2004 and September 30, 2005. Not all agencies take many significant actions that affect other levels of government; th erefore this report focuse s on the agencies that have regular and substantive inte ractions on regulatory matters that involve States, localities, and tribes, as well as the private sect or. This report also lists and briefly discusses the regulations meeting the Title II threshold and the specific requirements of Sections 202 and 205 of the Act. Four rules have met this threshold - one (EPA 's Rulemaking on Section 126 Petition from North Carolina to Reduce Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matt er and Ozone) was an intergovernmental mandate. The appendix to this report discusse s agency consultation efforts. These include both those efforts required under the Act and the many actions conducted by agencies above and beyond these requirements. 138 CHAPTER I: IMPACTS ON STATE , LOCAL , AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS Since passage of the Unfunded Mandates Refo rm Act, six rules have imposed costs of more than $100 million per year (adjusted for inflation) on State, local, and tribal governments (and thus have been classified as public s ector mandates under the Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995). EPA issued all six of these rules, which are described here.120 EPA's Rule on Standards of Performan ce for Municipal Waste Combustors and Emissions Guidelines (1995): This rule set standards of performance for new municipal waste combustor (MWC) units and emission guidelines for existing MWCs under sections 111 and 129 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7411, 42 U.S.C. 7429]. The standards and guidelines apply to MWC units at plants with combustion capacities greater than 35 mega grams per day (Mg/da y) (approximately 40 tons per day) of municipal solid waste (MSW). The EPA st andards require sources to achieve the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of air pollutants that the Administrator determined is achievable, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emissions reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements. EPA estimated the annualized costs of the em issions standards and guidelines to be $320 million per year (in constant 1990 dollars ) over existing regulations. While EPA estimated the cost of such standards for new sources to be $43 million per year, the cost to existing sources was estimated to be $277 million per year. The annual emissions reductions achieved through this regulatory action include, for example, 21,000 Mg. of sulfur dioxide; 2,800 Mg. of particulate matte r (PM); 19,200 Mg of nitrogen oxides; 54 Mg. of mercury; and 41 Kg. of dioxins/furans. EPA's Standards of Performance for New Sta tionary Sources and Guidelines for Control of Existing Sources: Municipa l Solid Waste Landfills (1996): This rule set performance standards for new municipal solid waste la ndfills and emission guidelines for existing municipal solid waste landfills under section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The rule addressed non-methane organic compounds (NMOC) and methane emissions. NMOC include volatile organic compounds (VOC), hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), and odorous compounds. Of the landfills required to install controls, about 30 percent of the existing landfills and 20 percent of the new landfills are privately owned. The remaining landfills are publicly owned. Th e total annualized costs for co llection and control of air emissions from new and existing MSW landfills are estimated to be $100 million. 120We note that EPA's proposed rules setting air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter may ultimately lead to expenditures by State, local, or tribal governments of $100 million or more. However, Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act provides that agency statements of compliance with Section 202 must be conducted \"unless otherwise prohibited by law\". The conference report to this legislation indicates that this language means that the section \"does not require the preparation of any estimate or analysis if the agency is prohibited by law from considering the estimate or analysis in adopting the rule.\" EPA has stated, and the courts have affirmed, that under the Clean Air Act, the primary air quality standards are health-based and EPA is not to consider costs. 139 EPA's National Primary Drinking Water Re gulations: Disinfect ants and Disinfection Byproducts (1998): This rule promulgates maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs) and enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for about a dozen disinfectants and byproduc ts that result from the interact ion of these disinfectants with organic compounds in drinking water. The rule will require additional treatment at about 14,000 of the estimated 75,000 covered water system s nationwide. The costs of the rule are estimated at $700 million annually. The quantified benefits estimates range from zero to 9,300 avoided bladder cancer cases annually, with an estimated monetized value of $0 to $4 billion per year. Possible reductions in rectal and colon cancer and adverse reproductive and developmental effects were not quantified. EPA's National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment (1998): This rule estab lishes new treatment and monitoring requirements (primarily related to filtration) for drinking water systems that use surface water as their source and serve more than 10,000 people. The purpose of the rule is to enhance health protection against potentially harmful microbial contaminants. EPA estimated that the rule will impose total annual costs of $300 millio n per year. The rule is expected to require treatment changes at about half of the 1,400 large surface water systems, at an annual cost of $190 million. Monitoring re quirements add $96 million per year in additional costs. All systems will also have to perform enhanced monitoring of filter performance. The estimated benefits include average reductions of 110,000 to 338,000 cases of cryptosporidiosis annually, with an estimated monetized value of $0.5 to $1.5 billion, and possible reductions in the in cidence of other waterborne diseases. EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Eliminati on: System B Regulations for Revision of the Water Pollution Control Program Addressing Storm Water Discharges (1999): This rule expands the existing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program for storm water control. It covers smaller m unicipal storm sewer systems and construction sites that disturb one to five acres. The rule allows for th e exclusion of certain sources from the program based on a demonstration of the lack of impact on water quality. EPA estimates that the total cost of the rule on Federal and Stat e levels of government, and on the private sector, is $803.1 million annually. EPA considered alternatives to the rule, including the option of not re gulating, but found that the rule was the option that was \"most cost effective or least burdensome, but also protective of the water quality.\" EPA's National Primary Drinking Water Regulations; Arsenic and Clarifications to Compliance and New Source Contaminants Monitoring (2001): This rule reduces the amount of arsenic that is allowed to be in drinking water from 50 ppb to 10 ppb. It also revises current monitoring requirements a nd requires non-trans ient, non-community water systems to come into compliance with the standard. This rule may affect either State, local or tribal governmen ts or the private sector at an approximate annualized cost of $206 million. The monetized benefits of the rule range from $140 to $198 million per year. The EPA selected a standard of 10 ppb b ecause it determined that this was the level that best maximizes health risk reduction benefits at a cost th at is justified by the benefits, as required by the Safe Drinking Water Act. 140 CHAPTER II: A REVIEW OF SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY MANDATES In FY2005, Federal Agencies issued four rule s that were subject to Sections 202 and 205 of the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 becau se they require expenditures in any year by State, local or tribal governments, in the aggr egate, or by the private sector, of at least $100 million in any one year (adjusted annually for inflation). During FY 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services issued one proposed rule and one final rule, the Department of Transporta tion issued one final rule, and the Environmental Protection Agency issued one proposed rule. EPA's \"Rulemaking on Section 126 Petition from North Carolina to Reduce Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone\" was the only rule for which expected expe nditures to State, local or tr ibal governments, and the private sector, in the aggregate, totaled more than $110 million. All of the other rules cited in this section were rules that required on ly private sector expenditures in any year, in the aggregate, to total more than $110 million. OMB worked with the agencies to ensure th at the selection of the regulatory option for final rules fully complied with the requirements of Title II of the Act. For proposed rules, OMB often worked with the agency to ensure that they also solicited co mment on alternatives. Descriptions of the rules in a ddition to agency statements regarding compliance with the Act are included in the following section. A. Department of Health and Human Services Standards for Electronic Health Care Claim Attachments (Proposal): This proposed rule sets forth an electronic standard for claims attach ments. The standard is required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. It will be us ed to transmit clinical data, in addition to the data contained in the claims standard, to help establish medical necessity for coverage and payment. HHS estimated that the private sector would ex pend in excess of $110 million to implement all of the transaction standards. Since electronic hea lth care claims attachme nts are only one of the eight transactions, and since ther e are only six attachment types at this time, its assumption is that expenditures to meet just the electronic health care claims attachment requirements may not exceed the UMRA threshold for the private sector. However, if that assumption is incorrect, and the costs of implementing the electronic health care claims attachments standards exceed the UMRA threshold, HHS believes that anticipated be nefits of the proposed rule justify the added costs. Establishment and Maintenance of Records Purs uant to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Final): This rulemaking is one of a number of actions being taken to improve FDA's ability to res pond to threats of bioterrorism. Section 414(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), which was added by section 306 of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Pr eparedness and Response Act of 2002 (the Act), authorizes the Secretary, through FDA, to promulgate final regulations by 141 December 12, 2003. The Act authorizes regulations that require the establishment and maintenance of records, for not longer than two years, which would allow the Secretary to identify the immediate previous sources and the immediate subsequent recipients of food, including its packaging. The require d records would be those that are needed by FDA in order to address credible threats of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Specific covered entities are those that manufacture, process, pack, transport, distribute, receive, hold, or import food. FDA determined that this final rule does c onstitute a significant rule under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The future costs from th e recordkeeping rule incl ude the recurring costs, which reach their long-term value in the third y ear after promulgation of the final rule. These costs will be incurred by all domestic facilitie s that manufacture, process, pack, transport, distribute, receive, hold, or im port food except very small retail facilities. Recurring costs from collecting new information as well as the learning costs for new entrants will be incurred in each future year. For year 3 and later years, FDA expect s those costs to range from $121,980,000 to $125,788,000. B. Department of Transportation Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (Final) - The Transportation Recall Enhancement Accountability and Documentation (TREAD) Act re quired the Secretary of Transportation to initiate rulemaking to require a warning system in new motor vehicles to indicate to the operator when a tire is significantly under-inflated. The ag ency issued a final rule for tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS)(establishing FMV SS No. 138) on June 5, 2002; however, the final rule establishing the i ssued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in August 2003. The agency has taken action in acco rdance with the Administrative Procedures Act to reestablish FMVSS No. 138, in a manner consistent with th e court's decision, and also provided a new phase-in period. This final rule is not expected to result in the expenditure by State, local, or tribal governments, in the aggregate, or more than $112 million annually, but it is expected to result in an expenditure of that magnitude by vehicle manufacturers and/or their suppliers. In this final rule, NHTSA is adopting a four-tire, 25-percent requirement, which we believe is consistent with safety and the mandate in the TREAD Act. We note that in promulgating a performance standard, NHTSA has left the door open for an arra y of technologies that may be used to meet the standard's requirements. With further TP MS development, we expect that vehicle manufacturers will have a number of technological choices that will provide broad flexibility to minimize their costs of compliance with the standard. C. Environmental Protection Agency Rulemaking on Section 126 Petition from North Caro lina to Reduce Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone (Proposed) - This action includes two separate but related rulemakings to address interstate transport with respect to the 8-hour ozon e and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) National Ambient Air Quality Sta ndards. In one part, EPA is responding to a petition submitted to the Agency in March 2004, by the State of North Carolina pursuant to 142 section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petition requests that EPA make findings that emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) from large electric generating units (EGUs) in 12 States are significantly cont ributing to PM2.5 nonattainment or maintenance problems in North Carolina and that NOx emissions from large EGUs in 5 States are significantly contributing to 8-hour ozone nonattainment or maintenance problems in North Carolina. The second part of this rulemaking is related to EPA's Clean Air Inte rstate Rule (CAIR), promulgated on March 10, 2005, which addresses interstate tr ansport of NOx and SO2. CAIR requires 28 States and the District of Colu mbia to revise their State impl ementation plans (SIPs) to reduce emissions of NOx and/or SOx. Controlling these emissions will assist the downwind areas in meeting the PM2.5 and 8-hour ozone national ambi ent air quality standards. This current rulemaking action is also proposi ng certain revisions to the CAIR and the Acid Rain Program. The EPA is taking the position that the requireme nts of UMRA apply because this action could result in the establishment of enforceable manda tes directly applicable to sources (including sources owned by State and local governments) that could result in co sts greater than $100 million in any one year. According to EPA's analysis, the total net economic impact on government-owned entities is expected to be negative in both 2010 and 2015. Government entities projected to experience compliance costs in excess of 1 percent of revenues have some potential for significant impact resulting from implementation of this rulemaking. In a manner consistent with the intergovernmental consulta tion provisions of secti on 204 of the UMRA, EPA carried out consultations with th e governmental entities potentially affected by this rule during the CAIR rulemaking process. 143 APPENDIX : AGENCY CONSULTATION ACTIVITIES UNDER THE UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM ACT OF 1995 Sections 203 and 204 of the Act require agencies to seek input from State, local and tribal governments on new Federal regulations imposing si gnificant intergovernmental mandates. This appendix summarizes consultation ac tivities by agencies whose acti ons affect State, local and tribal governments. Eight agencies (the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Educa tion, Justice, Health and Human Services, Housi ng and Urban Development, and Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency) have involved St ate, local and tribal governments not only in their regulatory processes, but also in their program planning a nd implementation phases. These agencies have worked to enhance the regulator y environment by improving the way in which the Federal government relates to its intergovernmental partners . In general, many of the Departments and agencies not listed here (inclu ding the Departments of Energy, State, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, and the Small Busine ss Administration and the General Services Administration) do not often impos e mandates upon States, localities or tribes and so have fewer occasions to consult with these governments. As the following descriptions indicate, Fede ral agencies are conducting a wide range of consultations. Agency consultations sometimes involve multiple levels of government, depending on the agency's understanding of the scope and impact of the rule. OMB continues to work with agencies to ensure that consultation occurs with the appropria te level of government. A. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 1. Biotechnology Regulations: APHIS is planning to revise its existing biotechnology regulations for genetically engineered (GE) plants and other organisms th at are potential plant pests (7 CFR 340). One regulatory revision may include ut ilizing the expanded authority of the Plant Protection Act to broaden the scope of regulations beyond GE organisms that are pot ential plant pests to include GE biological control organisms and GE plants which may have the potential to be noxious weeds. Also under consideration is the development of a multi-tiere d, risk-based permitting system to replace the current permit/notificati on system. Separately, APHIS is developing a regulation that would estab lish conditions under which APHI S would share with States confidential business information (CBI) we r eceive related to our biotechnology program. APHIS' Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS) program admi nisters these regulations. APHIS-BRS makes continuous efforts to reach ou t to partners and to parties affected by our regulations to increase confidence in th e effectiveness of our biotechnology regulatory system. In FY 2005, BRS entered into a coope rative program with the National Plant Board (NPB) to collect input and perspe ctives from the States on the most important aspects of the 144 Agency's regulatory system and items that AP HIS should consider during State evaluations. State agencies are often on the front line as the Agency's bi otechnology regulations are being implemented on a daily basis. NPB and BRS are using this project as a springboard to improve cooperation on a wide range of i ssues related to the regulation of biotechnology, in particular those issues that have the great est impacts upon the States. BRS he ld several follow-up meetings with the NPB concerning how the regulatory system works, the safety of the products that are deregulated by BRS' system, and the pr ocess for revising the regulations. Beginning in 2004 and continuing in 2005, BR S used input from meetings and discussions with the National Association of St ate Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) and the NPB to start shaping the propos ed revisions to the regulations. BRS' interaction with NPB concerning the sharing of CBI led to the initiat ion of the rulemaking to address this issue. As a result of interactions with NASDA and NPB, BRS received many diverse and helpful suggestions which will be considered in the process of revising our regulations. For example, BRS heard renewed concerns about how it handles CBI, which will be addressed through rulemaking. Another significant comment th at BRS will be considering is the States' need for assurance that the biotech regulat ions for imported commodities will not provide advantages for foreign versus domestic products . In addition to receiv ing valuable comments such as these, interactions with the States have resulted in a renewed commitment and partnership between State and Federal agencies . While the consultations with stakeholder groups, NASDA, and the Plant Board will not sole ly be responsible for the changes to the Agency's biotechnology regulations, their comme nts and feedback will contribute to the Agency's revisions to the regulations. 2. Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) : APHIS' Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ ) program carries ou t numerous activities to detect and contain, and in some cases, to manage or eradicate plant pests damaging to agricultural and environmental resources of the Un ited States. Specific pest programs include activities to detect, contain, manage, or eradicate, among ot her plant pests, Phytophthora ramorum (a fungus commonly known as Sudden Oak Death), emerald ash borer (an exotic pest of ash trees), and citrus canker (a bacterial disease). These programs are conducted cooperatively w ith State agencies, wh ich share the costs with APHIS. In cases where APHIS regulations could affect Native American tribes, those tribes are included in its consultatio ns, as for example, in the case of Phytophthora ramorum, where numerous Indian tribes have expre ssed interest in these consultations. Operational plans and strategic action plans ar e prepared jointly and reflect the respective roles of State and Federal partners. APHIS cons ults regularly and frequently (sometimes on a daily basis) on program strategies, methods , operations, and progress. PPQ cultivates consultations with State agencies through National Plant Board meetings, task forces, work groups, and special committees to resolve issues of mutual concern. PPQ contacts and consults with Tribal governments that may be affected by contemplated PPQ activities in order to resolve issues of mutual concern. 145 Concerns generally arise over the effects of APHIS regulations a nd policy on States, who are often largely responsible for enforcing the re gulations under cooperative agreements. Points of concern may include availability of res ources, practical obstacles to program success, coordinated national approach, and balancing the interests of stak eholders affected by quarantine actions with those who could be adversely affect ed by spread of the pest of concern. Tribal issues often concern the impact of regulation on Tribal busine sses or cultural practices. Citrus canker : During 2005, an unusually active year for hurricanes changed the distribution of citrus canker, as well as other citrus diseases and pests, in Florida. Through cooperative survey with the State of Florida, APHI S determined the new range of citrus canker. Subsequent extensive consultati on with the State and with the citrus industry led to a new strategy and management plan for overall citr us health. Once implemented, this plan will encourage sanitary and management practices th roughout the citrus industr y and lead to greater confidence in the disease-free status of citrus m oving to other states and for export. Cooperative agreements and cost-sharing minimize the econo mic and operational costs borne by Florida. Emerald ash borer: Through continuous consultations with the States of Ohio, Indiana, Maryland, and Michigan, APHIS has been able to devise regulat ory strategies that protect against the interstate spread of this pest whil e being practical to enforce given the affected industries. States are provided funds through cooperative agreements to assist in enforcement of the regulations. Phytophthora ramorum : Through extensive consultations with the States of California, Oregon, and Washington, which produce a major por tion of U.S. nursery stock, and with States that purchase nursery stock from California, Oregon and Washington, APHIS was able to devise regulatory strategies that protect against the intersta te spread of this pest while being practical to enforce. These consultations successfully mi nimized the economic and operational costs to the States of implementing the regulatory program a nd helped to ensure that nursery stock could continue to move interstate. During 2004, APHIS also consulted with various tribes in Northern California to discuss possible effects of P. ramorum regulations. 3. Elimination of Brucellosis in th e Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) Affected parties include produ cers of domestic livestock, State governments, and Federal agencies. Each of these enti ties is represented on the Greater Yellowstone Interagency Brucellosis Committee (GYIBC). Governmental representatives to the committee include the State veterinarians and director s of the State wildlife agenci es from Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho; the U.S. Dept. of Agricu lture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services (USDA, APHIS, VS); the U.S. Forest Service; the Nationa l Park Service; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; and the Bureau of Land Management as voting members of the GYIBC executive committee. There are also th ree nonvoting members represented on the GYIBC executive committee: U.S. Geological Survey; Agri cultural Research Service; and the InterTribal Bison Cooperative. 146 The GYIBC holds at least two public meetings per year to discuss brucellosis elimination planning for bison and elk in the GYA. Cons ultation was also carried out through regular meetings of representatives of the signatories to the Interagency Bison Management Plan developed for the management of Yellowstone National Park brucellosis infected bison in Montana. In addition, VS also consults regularly with the GYA State Veterinarians, representatives of GYA State wi ldlife agencies, and the Wyom ing Brucellosis Coordination Team. The issue of how to best approach brucello sis elimination planning, including research, was discussed. Public and intergovernmental part ners worked with the Federal Government to determine what research should be done as part of the plan. VS also consulted with the public and intergovernmental agencies to determine how best to help the GYA States regain or maintain their brucellosis Class Free classification. USDA and the Department of the Interior have agreed upon a draft GYIBC memorandum of understanding (MOU) to replace an expire d MOU for operation of the GYIBC, focused toward brucellosis elimination planning. The MOU will be presented to the governors of the GYA States for their review and approval. VS also consulted with the State of Wyoming to assist it in regaining its brucel losis Class Free classification. 4. U.S. Program to Eradicate Bovine T uberculosis (TB) In Domestic Livestock. APHIS consulted with State and industry o fficials regarding the TB status of New Mexico. Officials from New Mexico proposed th at the State be divided into two zones with different disease classifications. Stakeholders felt that the boundari es of the affected zone were sufficiently clear to make this distinction. APHIS amended the bovine tuberculosis re gulations by recognizing two separate zones with different tuberculosis risk classifications in New Mexico, raising the designa tion of one of those zones from modified accredited advanced to accredited free. The change was published in the Federal Register in July 2005 and made final in October 2005. 5. National Animal Identi fication System (NAIS). The implementation of NAIS will affect ot her State and Tribal governments, and livestock producers and other stakeh olders. The consultation proce ss consisted of discussions at meetings and other events with stakeholders including representatives from industry groups and other nongovernmental organizations, and State a nd Tribal officials. In addition, USDA held public meetings with various stakehol der groups affected by the program. Issues/Concerns Raised by Public/Intergovernment al Partners include: the costs of national identification, the ability to maintain confidentiali ty, flexibility of the program, and concerns that the NAIS information would be used by individuals (other than animal health authorities) for food safety issues and that traceability of food pr oducts would increase the participants' risk of liability and financial loss. 147 As a result of the consultation, public and private funding will be required for the NAIS to become fully operational. USDA has provided funds to States and Tribes through cooperative agreements and has provided the information syst ems for the program. The integration of animal identification technology standard s (electronic identification, re tinal scan, DNA, etc.) will be determined by industry to ensure that the most practical options are implemented, and that new ones can easily be incorporat ed into the NAIS. Based on producer concerns about confidentiality of data, USDA has determined th at certain information should be held outside USDA. Animal tracking information will be held in private and State databases. USDA will only access certain information when needed to respond to a disease investigation. USDA also continues to consider information gained through consultations to update the draft strategic plan and program standards, as well as further deve lop and revise an implementation plan for the NAIS. B. Department of Commerce On June 15, 2006, President Bush issued Proclamation 8031 establishing the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument. The Proclamation sets forth the purposes and management regime for the Monument , as well as restrictions and prohibitions on activities in the Monument to pr otect Monument resources. The th ree Trustees responsible for management of the Monument are the Departme nt of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Depa rtment of the Interior, through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the State of Hawaii. In issuing the Proclamation, th e President recognized the impo rtance of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands as a place rich in history and of great cultural significance to Native Hawaiians. The Proclamation includes a specific permit categor y for native Hawaiian practices to ensure that Native Hawaiian practices may continue to be conducted in the Monument consistent with the protection of Monument resource s. Since issuance of the Proc lamation, the State of Hawaii has been an integral part ner in the ongoing proce ss of carrying out the Proclamation's vision for management of the Monument. As a Monument Tr ustee, the State of Hawaii has been an equal partner involved in and consulted with c oncerning all important aspects of Monument management, including the permitting of activitie s within the Monument and development of the MOA. Subsequent to issuance of the Procla mation, NOAA and USFWS developed joint regulations to codify the provi sions of the Proclamation. The State of Hawaii was consulted during development of the regulations and rais ed concerns about its responsibilities and jurisdiction within the Monument. The joint regulations included the State's language for the preamble of the regulations to address these conc erns. The State, as a Monument Trustee, has also participated fully in development of the MOA. To address the State's concerns with the codifying regulations, NOAA and FWS incorporated the language suggested by the State into the prea mble of the regulations. The MOA accommodates the concerns of all the Trustees, in cluding the State of Hawa ii and will be signed by the three Trustees as equal partners in managing the monument. Further, the MOA provides specifically for the identification of culturally significant religious locations and native Hawaiian 148 practices that may benefit Monument resour ces and the Native Hawaiian community. As management of the Monument continues, the Trust ees will continue work together to provide for unified management in the spirit of cooperative c onservation to protect Monu ment resources. C. Department of Education On June 21, 2005 (70 FR 35782), the Depart ment published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) under Part B of the Individual s with Disabilities Ed ucation Act (IDEA), as amended by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004. The NPRM proposed to implement the substantial statutor y changes and to restructure the existing regulations for this program. Because Part B of the IDEA imposes signi ficant requirements on the special education services available to all children with disabilitie s in the country, these regulations affect state educational agencies, local schoo l districts, public elementary and secondary schools, special education teachers and related se rvice providers, children with disabilities and their parents. Prior to publishing the NPRM, the Depart ment solicited advice and recommendations from the public on the regulatory issues under Pa rt B of the IDEA. On December 29, 2004 (69 FR 77968), the Department published a notice in viting written comments and recommendations regarding changes that might be needed to existing regulations, particularly to provide clarification to new statutory re quirements or facilita te the implementation of the program. In this notice the Department also announced a seri es of seven regional public meetings to gather comment on what should be incl uded in the regulations. The Department received over 6000 comments in response to the December 29, 2004 notice, including comments received at the pub lic meetings. They included comments from children with disabilities, parents, teachers and related service providers, State and local agency personnel, and parent-advocate and professional or ganizations. The comments addressed each of the major provisions of the revised law, including those on personnel qua lifications and highly qualified special education teachers, evaluations of children, individualized education programs, participation of private school children with di sabilities, due process pr ocedures and discipline procedures for children with disabilities. The comments were reviewed and considered in developing the June 2005 NPRM. States and local school districts were very concerned about the statut ory provisions requiring highly qualified special education teachers. As a result, the Department attempted to clarify these complicated requirements in the NPRM. D. Department of Health and Human Services 1. Flexibility and Innovation in Child Welfare Services Provisions of the Social Security Act authorize the Department of Health and Human Services to effect approval for as many as ten St ates per year to conduct demonstration projects involving the waiver of certain re quirements of the Title IV-E foster care program. The projects 149 are intended to test new approaches to the delivery and financing of child welfare services. The child welfare waiver demonstrati on projects provide States with greater flexibility to use Title IV-E funds for a range of child we lfare services in addition to fost er care in order to facilitate improved safety, permanency and well-being for children.121 All projects must be cost-neutral to the Federal government and are required to in clude a rigorous evaluation conducted by an independent evaluator. While there has been public interest in child welfare waiver demonstrations, waiver requests must be submitted by a State's child welfare agency. Thus, the Children's Bureau within Administration for Children and Familie s (ACF) in HHS works primarily with state agencies on the child welfare waiver demonstrat ions. States applying for waivers, however, must seek public input on their proposals before they are approved. ACF has engaged in considerable consultation and discussion with State representatives regarding child welfare demonstra tion proposals. General technical assistance has been provided to interested States prior to submission of proposals and extensive dialogue occurs during the negotiation of waivers. Consulta tion occurs primarily through conference calls, issue papers and correspondence. ACF leaders and staff have also met in person with State representatives when requested. ACF, for example, was successful in wo rking with the State of Florida to approve the first ever Statewide child welfare waiver demonstration in March 2006. Currently, 15 States have active waiver demonstrations, involving 19 demonstration components.122 Through timely technical assistance a nd negotiations with States, HHS was able to complete an expeditious review and approval of six of the currently approved projects. Over the coming years, these projects will promot e improved outcomes for vulnerable children and families in the affected States and will also make an important national contribution to the evidence base in child welfare policy and practice. 2. Health Status Disparities Affectin g American Indians and Alaska Natives The Department of Health and Human Servic es and Indian Tribes share the goal of eliminating health and human se rvice disparities among American Indians and Alaska Natives, and of ensuring that access to crit ical health and human services is maximized. To achieve this goal, and to the extent practicable and permitted by law, it is essential that federally recognized Indian Tribes and the HHS engage in open, continuous, and meaningful consultation. The importance of such consultation was affirmed through a 2004 Presidential Memorandum and the HHS policy guidance signed and issued January 2005. During FY 2005, HHS leadership worked closely on health-disparities wi th Indian tribal governments and tribal organizations, such as th e National Congress of American Indians, the National Indian Health Board, the Tribal Se lf-Governance Advisory Committee, the Direct Service Tribes Advisory Committee, the Ameri can Indian Higher Education Consortium, the 121Normally, Title IV-E funds may only be used to pay for foster care maintenance payments and related allowable administrative costs. 122Some States have more than one approved waiver demonstration project and some waiver agreements involve more than one type of service intervention. 150 National Indian Child Welfare Association, th e National Council on Urban Indian Health, as well as a number of locally -based governmental and non-governmental tribal groups. Below are some examples of HHS consulta tions with Indian tribes during FY 2005 7th Annual Tribal Budg et Consultation Session : HHS agencies engage Tribes in an annual conversation about budget priorities. Thr ough this process, Tribes have been able to state their funding priorities to HHS. On May 17-18, 2005, HHS held its Seventh Annual Budget Consultation Session. This session was one and one-half days at the request of tribal leaders. As a result, support for Tribal programming has increased an average of 4.1 percent for the pa st three years and funding has b een able to be targeted to those areas of greatest nee d, as defined by Tribes. Regional Tribal Consultation Sessions : In 2005, HHS Regional Directors coordinated its 3rd annual year of Regional Tribal consu ltation sessions. Nine sessions were conducted in the field and all were coordinated with IHS Area Directors and supported by IGA. The sessions were attended by over 890 people a nd had over 145 Tribes represented at the sessions. \"Barriers to American Indian/Alaska Native/Native American Access to HHS Programs\" : In 2004, HHS began to study its discre tionary grant programs to identify barriers that kept American Indian/Ala ska Native/Native Americans from accessing funding opportunities from HHS sources. The study was conducted th rough the use of a survey instrument sent to both HHS program offices and tribal members. In FY 2005, a final report on the barriers was presented to the Intradepartmental Council on Native American Affairs (ICNAA). The report identif ied 24 barriers. The report also included 46 suggestions that may be implemented to overcome the barriers. Some are currently addressed by individual Oper ating Divisions; and some were identified as actions the Tribes themselves could correct without the invol vement of HHS.123 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Serv ices (CMS) Tribal Technical Advisory Committee (TTAG) : During 2005, CMS established a Tribal consultation policy Subcommittee that developed a proposed policy for CMS review. CMS has made changes and the TTAG will be conducting co nsultations on the plan in early 2006. CMS Consultation with the Tribal Technical Advisory Group : CMS consulted with this group, comprised of elected Trib al Leader representatives, regarding ways in which to implement effectively the new Medicare prescr iption drug benefit at pharmacies operated by IHS, Tribes and Urban (I/T/U) programs. As a result, CMS: - added a provision to final regulation re quiring that Part D plans offer contracts to all I/T/U pharmacies in their service area.; 123The report is available on the HHS website at the following address: http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/06/barriers2access/ 151 - authorized Part D Plans to count I/T/U pharmacies and pharmacies operated by Federally Qualified Health Centers and Ru ral Health Centers toward the standards for convenient access to network pharmacies required by the Part D regulations. - developed a Part D model contract addendum that served as a \"floor\" for contracting with pharmacies operated by IH S, Tribes and Urban Indian health programs. The highest priority identified at all tribal consultation sessions was the need to increase resources for Indian tribes. In addition, Tribes sought to increase acce ss to HHS programs and health services; enhanced consultation and communication with HHS; and the elimination of health disparities. Tribes also expressed speci fic interest in health promotion and disease prevention; Medicare and Medicaid; emergenc y preparedness; health and human service facilities construction, a nd reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. In FY 2005, HHS resources provided to Tribes (or expended for the benefit of Tribes) was approximately $4.66 billion, an increase of approximately $95.5 m illion over the FY 2004 amount of $4.57 billion. These gains came in both appropriated funding as well as through increased tribal access to non-earmarked funds and increases in discretionary set-asides. E. Department of Housing and Urban Development 1. Working with Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) and Residents on Revisions to the Public Housing Operating Fund. Authorized by the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq .), the Operating Fund makes assistance available to PHAs to operate and manage public housing. On September 19, 2005 (79 FR 54984), HUD published a final rule amending the regulations of the Public Housing Operating Fund Program at 24 CFR part 990, to provide a new formula for distributing operating subsidy to PHAs and establish requirements for PHAs to convert to asset management. HUD developed the final rule with the act ive participation of PHAs, public housing residents, and other relevant parties using the procedures of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990. HUD convened a negotiated rulemaking advisory committee (Committee) for the purposes of developing potential changes to the Operating Fund Pr ogram. The Committee consisted of 28 members, including repres entatives of PHAs, public housing tenant organizations, public housing advocacy groups, the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association (PHADA), the Council of Large Pub lic Housing Authorities (CLPHA), and the National Association of Housing and Redeve lopment Officials (NAHRO), multifamily housing providers, and HUD. The Committee held four m eetings. Members of the public were permitted to make statements during the meetings at designated times and to file written statements with the Committee for its consideration. The Committee made recommendations on ways to improve and clarify the regulations governing the Operating Fund Program taking into considerati on the recommendations of the congressionally-funded study by the Harvard University Graduate School of Design on the cost 152 of operating well-run public housin g. After a comprehensive review of the existing regulations, the Committee made recommendations concer ning, among other things, streamlining and simplifying operating subsidy calcul ations, the inclusion of a public entity fee, operating subsidy for vacant units, factor for inflation, and vari ous issues involved with conversion to asset management. The negotiated rulemaking process resulted in the development of an improved operating fund formula. Using the Committee's recommen dations, the new formula's calculations are simplified and the procedures are streamlined. Th e new formula also requires that PHAs convert to asset-based management, and es tablishes certain benchmarks re garding conversion to this new management model. 2. Working with Stakeholders to Improve Community Planning and Development (CPD) Performance Measures. On June 10, 2005 (70 FR 34043), HUD published a notice in the Federal Register announcing a proposed outcome performance measurement system for its community development programs. This proposed system would enable HUD to collect information on the outcomes of activities funded with CPD formula grants including Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG), or the Housing Opportunities for Person s with AIDS Program (HOPWA), and to aggregate that information at the national and local level. With input from a working group that included HUD and community developm ent entities, a final outcome performance measurement system was established and published on March 7, 2006 (71 FR 11470). On September 3, 2003, HUD issued CPD Notice 03-09 entitled, \"Development of State and Local Performance Measurements Systems for Community Planning and Development Formula Grant Programs.\" The notice encouraged CPD formula grantees assistance to develop and use performance measurement systems. In March 2004, the Council of State Comm unity Development Agencies (COSCDA) convened a meeting with representatives from the National Community Development Association (NCDA), the National Association for County Co mmunity Economic Development (NACCED), the National Associa tion of Housing and Redevel opment Officials (NAHRO), the National Council of State Housing Agencies (NCSHA), CPD, and HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research to discuss the deve lopment of a performance measurement system that would be used by CPD formula grantees to gather information and determine the effectiveness of their programs. That meeting resulted in the formation of a working group composed of representatives from those agencies and associations. The work ing group met at various times from June until November 2004 and developed the proposed outco me performance measurement system, which formed the basis of HUD's June 10, 2005, and March 7, 2006, Federal Register notices. This performance measurement system that resulted from the working group will enable HUD to collect information on the outcomes of activities funded with CPD formula grant 153 assistance, and to aggregate that information at the national and local level. The system will be incorporated into HUD's Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS), allowing for simplified data collection. F. Department of Justice Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) State, local and tribal law enforcement agencies are a ll affected by the continuing demands placed on them with regard to community policing, crime prevention, homeland security, and ethics and integrity to name a few cu rrent topics of interest . Gaining access to this information in the most efficient and cost effective way is of paramount importance. COPS has a history of working closely with state, local, and tribal agencies. Since its inception in 1994 through the Violent Crime Cont rol Act, COPS has consulted regularly with professional law enforcement organizations, such as the International Asso ciation of Chiefs of Police, National Sheriffs Association, the Po lice Executive Research Forum, the Police Foundation, and NOBLE on current i ssues facing law enforcement. COPS also maintains regular contact with intergovern mental organizations such as th e U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, and the National As sociation of Counties, which provides the perspective of local government on law enforcem ent issues. For more than a decade COPS has conducted research and evaluati ons with local police departme nts to identify barriers and challenges to their implementation of community policing. COPS consultation with state and local government is reflected in the training provided through the Regional Community Policing Institutes, best practices publica tions and other problem-specific gui des, and targeted initiatives. COPS Office representatives attend conferences, meetings and workgroups throughout the year, as well as hosting one-on-one meetings with law enforcement officials to remain current on the issues and concerns facing agencies today and to put in place any policies or programs that may help address such needs. In an effort to reach a broader audience of practitioners and interested parties, the COPS Office implemented a policy of providing inform ation on a wide range of topics through electronic means. Webcasts and conference calls were establishe d to address emerging needs and reach a maximum number of agencies with little or no cost to those agencies. Additionally, COPS established two surveys to be implemented in FY06. The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) will be posted on the COPS website in FY06. This survey will assist COPS in targeting areas of improvement for better dissemination of information to the public. The Community Policing Capacity/ Customer Satis faction Survey will focus on COPS Office performance in meeting our mission to advance community policing be assessing the impact of COPS Office grant resources and knowledge resource products (tra ining/technical assistance and publications) at increasing the capacity of grantees and knowle dge resource recipients to implement community policing strategies. COPS National Policing Conferences provide valuable information to those who attend. A dditionally, COPS provides a variety of knowledge products and workshop information for attendees to share with those unable to attend. 154 The Office of Community Policing Services (COPS Office) hosts conference calls to reach a maximum number of law enforcement prof essionals with pertinent information. COPS is developing a pilot series of conf erence calls to discuss specific grant management topics of interest to award recipients. The five subject areas are: 1) Legal Requirements: Retention, Nonsupplanting, and Allowable Costs; 2) Staying in Grant Compliance / Preparing for an Audit; 3) What Is Community Policing?; 4) Maintaining an Active Grant: Modifications, Extensions, and Related Grant Management Topics; and 5) Grant Closeout Process: Programmatic and Financial Issues. G. Department of Transportation Federal Transit Administration As a grant-making agency, the Federal Tran sit Administration (FTA ) is responsible for providing federal financial assistance to State, lo cal, and tribal governments. FTA consults with and addresses concerns raised by affected State, local, and tr ibal governments on regulatory issues. For example, on April 4, 2006, and April 7, 2006, FTA held two public meetings with tribal nations to discuss FTA' s new program \"Public Transporta tion on Indian Reservations.\" This $45 million dollar program will provide grants directly to tribal nations for eligible public transportation activities. Based on the comments received from the tw o outreach sessions and from a notice in the Federal Register, FTA modi fied its proposed requirements for the program by expanding eligible activities and lowering the local share requirements. FTA expected to receive 20 applications for funding under this new program. Instead, FTA received 99 applications for funding. FTA believes its outr each efforts and willingness to modify its requirements based on feedback is one of the reasons this program was so well-received. H. Environmental Protection Agency EPA continues to strengthen its partnership with Tribal governments through implementing Executive Order 13175 : Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments. It is completing guidance for Ex ecutive Order 13175 that will include procedures for implementing the Executive Order, and inform ation on how to analyze regulatory impacts on Tribes and areas of Indian Count ry. It will also provide guidanc e on selecting proper techniques for sharing information and gathering advice from Tribal officials during the early stages of the policy process. Consultation Mechanisms, General Outreach Activities and Communication Aids EPA has several mechanisms to help State, local, and Tribal offi cials learn about its regulatory plans and to let them know how they can engage in the rule-development process. For example, it distributes reprints of the se mi-annual Regulatory Agenda to more than 300 State, local, and Tribal govern ment organizations and leaders and participates in a Federal 155 government-wide State and local Governments Web site. It supports hotlines in both EPA Headquarters and the Regions where callers can get information on several topics, including regulatory and compliance information (further discussion of these communication aids below). In 1993, EPA chartered a cross-media advi sory body under Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), the Local Government Advisory Committee (LGAC). Supported by resources from the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations, the LGAC is composed primarily of elected and appointed local government officials from communities across the nation. Committee members provide advice and recommendations that assist the EPA in developing a stronger partnership with local gov ernments - a partnership that ultimately yields improved state and local government capacity to provide enviro nmental programs and services. Likewise, the Small Community Advisory Subcommittee (SCAS), a subcommittee of the LGAC, routinely advises the Agency on issues and concerns f acing smaller U.S. communities, and provides recommendations on regulations, policies, and gui dance affecting the environmental services they depend on. The LGAC meets approximately three times per year, and provides the Agency with recommendations and advice on: Changes needed to allow flexibility and i nnovation to accommodate local needs without compromising environmental performance, accountability or fairness; Ways to improve performance measurem ent and speed dissemination of new environmental protection techniques a nd technologies among local governments; Improvements to program management a nd regulatory planning and development processes by involving local gove rnments more effectively as partners in environmental management Projects to help local governments deal w ith the challenge of financing environmental protection infrastructure The Tribal Operations Committee similarly addresses Tribal interests. EPA's program offices regularly work with groups of State, lo cal, and Tribal official s to address specific environmental and programmatic issues. Exampl es include media-specific FACA committees, regulatory negotiation advisory committees, and policy groups. EPA and States share responsibility for implementing our national environmental programs, and our success in meeting the nati on's environmental goals depends on effective EPA-State partnerships. Sin ce 1995, EPA has been working with States to build the National Environmental Performance Partnership System (NEPPS), a collaborative, results-oriented system for environmental management that has become the predominant way in which EPA and States work together to deliver environmental programs. Under NEPPS, EPA and States set priorities and design and implement strategies for achieving environmental and public health goals together. The joint Partnership and Pe rformance Work Group, comprised of EPA leaders and high-level State officials drawn from the membership of the Envir onmental Council of the States (ECOS), leads the effort to build performance partnerships and provides an ongoing forum for raising and resolving policy and impl ementation issues and improve joint planning. 156 EPA also consults with ECOS, the only na tional organization repr esenting the State environmental commissioners, on the full range of pr ogram and policy matters affecting States. EPA continues to work with States unde r the National Environmental Performance Partnership System (NEPPS), principally thr ough the Environmental Council of the States (ECOS) whose objective is to incr ease States' participation in Agency activities, particularly those affecting State-implemented programs. Committees consisting of both State and EPA members perform most of this work through foru ms that are open to other stakeholders. EPA and the ECOS have an active joint workgroup to address continuing implementation issues and to identify and remove remaining barriers to effective implementation of NEPPS. ECOS has also launched several other cons ultation projects with EPA incl uding work on children's health issues, a partnership to build locally and nationally accessible environmental systems, and development of core performance measures. 1. Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) Continues its General Outreach Activities The Office of Prevention, Pesticides a nd Toxic Substances (OPPTS) has several continuing outreach mechanisms related to its mission that allow OPPTS to routinely secure State and Tribal insights and advice on issues re lated to the implementation of OPPTS' role in protecting public health and the environment from potential risk from toxic chemicals. These institutionalized processes are therefore to so me extent independent of specific rulemaking activities, including the following outreach mechanisms. OPPTS' Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) created the Forum on State Tribal Toxics Action (FOSTTA) in the early 1990s as a vehicle to encourage State and Tribal involvement in OPPT decision making. OPPT has procured the services of ECOS and National Tribal Environmental Council (N TEC) to ensure appropriate a nd adequate State and Tribal representation at the FOSTTA meeti ngs. In recent years, OPPT established a Tribal program to better communicate our programs and activities with Native Ameri can Indian Tribes, to build more effective partnerships with Tribes to sa feguard and protect the environment from toxic hazards, and to promote pollution prevention in I ndian country. Some ma jor activities of the Tribal program include grants funding, internal training on Tribal issu es, follow-up activities from EPA Tribal Operations Committee meeti ngs, interagency coordination efforts, and stakeholder outreach. OPPT is committed to working in partnership with Tribal governments via appropriate and effective consultation. In 2002, OPPT established the National Pollution Prevention a nd Toxics Advisory Committee (NPPTAC) as the national advisory body to provide advice, information and recommendations on the overall policy and operation of programs managed by OPPT, in performing its duties and responsibilities under the Toxics Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA). NPPTAC has provided a forum for public discussion and the development of independent advice to EPA by leveraging the experience, strengths and responsibilities of a broad range of Agency constituents and st akeholders, including State and Tribal officials. For example, NPPTAC ha s provided policy advice and recommendations in areas such as assessment and management of chemical risk, pollution prevention, risk 157 communication, and opportunities for coordinati on. NPPTAC produced four recommendations on High Production Volumes Chemicals; two re commendations on Pollution Prevention; two recommendations on Tribal issues; and one r ecommendation on non-paint sources of lead. OPPT also relies very heavily on our Regional programs to interact with States and Tribes on Regional specific and national issues to ensu re adequate perspectives are included in this Office's decision making processes. In 2005 OPPT worked on development of a proposed regulation under Section 402(c)(3) of TSCA for addressing the risks from lead ba sed paint hazards that may be created during renovation and remodeling activitie s in buildings. In establishing a regulatory program under Title IV of TSCA, interested St ates and Tribes can develop th eir own renovation and remodeling programs which may be authorized by EPA to operate in lieu of the federal program as long as the State or Tribal program is at least as protective. EPA encourages States and Tribes to administer their own lead-based paint programs, because this results in more effective and efficient risk reduction efforts. Currently, 38 States, the District of Columbia, and three Tribes are operating lead-based paint trai ning and certification programs. EPA's experience in administering existing lead-based paint ac tivities program under TSCA section 402(a) suggests that the adoption and successful implementation of a national program by State, local, and Tribal governments will play a critical role in reduced exposures to lead-based paint hazards associated with renovati on, repair and painting activities. The Agency consulted with its State and Tribal partners on a number of occasions throughout the development of the proposal to discuss renova tion issues and to gauge their interest in developing and implementing renov ation and remodeling programs. The Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) in O PPTS uses the State Federal FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation Group (SFIREG), es tablished in 1974 by cooperative agreement between EPA and the American Association of Pesticide Control Officials (AAPCO), the association that represents State level pesticide regulatory officials. SFIREG identifies, analyzes and provides State comment on pesticide regul atory issues and provides a mechanism for ongoing exchange of information about EPA and State pesticide programs. With a full committee and two subcommittees, there are eight regularly scheduled meetings each year that offer State officials the opportuni ty to meet with EPA to discu ss issues including regulations in progress. One example of results from consulting with SFIREG was the formation of joint EPA-State workgroup to address a number of issues and projects. The Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) Tribal Program organized the Tribal Pesticide Program Council (TPPC) in late 1999. TPPC is a tribal technical resource, and program and policy dialogue and development group, focused on pesticide issues and concerns. It meets twice a year and provides a vehicle through whic h tribes can voice opinions on national pesticide policies and raise tribal pesticide issues to federal attention. Th e TPPC is a strong partner with the EPA to ensure that tribes will continue to provide a major impetus for the long-term strategic direction taken by the Office of Prevention, Pes ticide, and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) Tribal Program as it strives to build tribal capacity and produce an Agency pest icide strategy that is responsive to tribal needs and concerns. In addition, the TPPC serves as a technical resource pool for tribes in Indian country. The TPPC is compos ed of authorized representatives from federally 158 recognized tribes and Indian nations. Authorization must be in writing by a letter from either the Tribal Chairperson or a letter or resolution from the Tribal Council or similar governing body. At this time there are 42 authori zed representatives, including some authorized alternates. Thirty- two tribes or Indian nations ha ve authorized representatives. 2. Office of Policy, Economics and Innovation Outreach Activities EPA's National Center for Environmental Innovation (NCEI), in the Office of Policy, Economics, and Innovation (OPEI), routinely consults with States to promote regulatory efficiency and improved environmental results. Several NCEI programs engaged States in creating a more performance-based environm ental regulatory system. In FY 2005, the Performance Track Program worked closely w ith States to respond to a report from the Environmental Council of the Stat es (ECOS) related to State interest in, and commitment to, performance-based environmental programs. While performance-based programs are not mandatory features of a State's overall envir onmental program, over 20 States do have active programs. During FY 2005, EPA organized three workgroups with State representatives to respond to the ECOS report and develop approaches to work together -- and thus more efficiently -- in implementing these programs. In FY 2005, NCEI consulted with States to address regulatory issu es that can hinder smart growth at the local level and improved environmental performance by specific industry s ectors. Through the Sector Strategies Program, NCEI and other stakeholders focused on tailor ed approaches for 13 sectors comprised of 780,000 facilities, contribute $2.1 trillion to U.S. GDP (19 percent), and employ 19 percent of workers in the United States. In FY 2005, EPA worked closely with States to develo p a policy on the role of environmental management systems in Federa l environmental regulations and permits. This policy provided a framework to implement and evaluate alternative uses of EMSs in permits and regulations. During FY 2005, NCEI continued to work as a partner with State regulatory agencies through a variety of mechanisms. NCEI con tinued to expand its State Innovation Grants Program, selecting seven projects for funding from the 2005 competition. These projects reflected NCEI's strategic investment in as sisting States implement innovation in permitting programs, specifically: the expansion (3 new projects/sectors) of the Environmen tal Results Program model (a compliance-assistance, performance self-certification and statistically-based auditing approach) for small business sectors; the implementation of the National Pe rformance Track Program and parallel performance-based programs by States (3 states/projects); the further testing of Environmental Mana gement Systems (EMS) in permitting (1 state/project) to help busin ess adopt continuous process improvement strategies for environmental performance. NCEI selected these projects in a competition that was designed to respond to continued strong State interest in the program (26 propos als submitted in the FY 2005 competition totaling almost $4M in requests). NCEI also continued its collabor ative work with the States on a number of projects under the Joint EPA/State Agreement to Pursue Regulatory Innovation . 159 Likewise, NCEI provided information and assistance to States interested in the Environmental Results Program (ERP). ERP is an alternative regulatory approach to improve environmental performance and facility management in specific industry sectors, particularly those made up of small businesses. ERP integr ates compliance assistance, self-certification, compliance assurance and enforcement, and statis tically-based inspections and measurement to assess the environmental performan ce of facilities and overall sector s. In FY 2006 sixteen States pursued ERP in eight sectors overa ll. NCEI worked with interested States to adopt ERP or its components in the following ways: as a mandatory program requiring self -certification of all facilities in a sector; by voluntaril y, encouraging facilities to partic ipate in order to obtain the benefits of compliance assistan ce and the certainty of knowing th eir compliance status; or, in some cases, using ESRP as an alternative to formal permitting for large numbers of small facilities. NCEI also assisted in forming a consortium of states implementing ERP programs, allowing the states to provide gr eater leadership and direction. 3. Reaching out to Local and Small Governments EPA has also developed various materials intended to help small governments more easily understand Agency regulations. Profile of Local Government Operations : The Profile details all the environmental requirements with which a local government mu st comply and organizes the information based on operations, i.e., motor vehicle servicing, property management, etc. Th is makes it easier for the representative of a local government responsib le for an operation to find out about all the environmental requirements that might impact his or her operation and where to find more detailed compliance information. Local Government Environmental Assistance Network (LGEAN) : EPA helps support this Internet-based information service (that has pa rallel toll-free voice a nd fax-back options). LGEAN provides a first stop for local government officials with questions about environmental compliance. The site contains information from EPA and eight par ticipating nongovernmental organizations. Users can ask questions of experts, consult with their peers, review and comment on developing regulations, and find the full text or summaries of State and Federal environmental statutes. LGEAN alerts user s to hot topics and new developments in environmental compliance, tells them where to find technical and financial support, and provides them with a grant writing tutorial. Small Government Agency Plan : The Agency's interim Small Government Agency Plan supplements the intergovernmental consultations described above. The Plan outlines the analysis rule writers must complete to determine whethe r the regulatory requirements of a rule might uniquely affect small governments. Under the pla n, EPA encourages attention to such factors as whether small governments will experience highe r per-capita costs because of economies of scale. The Plan also considers whether they would need to hire professional staff or consultants for implementation or be required to purchase and operate expensive or sophi sticated equipment. EPA publishes the findings under the Small Government Agency Plan in the Federal Register 160 with proposed and final rules. When there are unique or significant impacts on small governments, EPA takes action to inform and assist them. Newsletter/Internet Site for Small Governments : Under a cooperative agreement funded by EPA, the International City/County Ma nagement Association (ICMA) publishes a newsletter designed for small governments covering regulatory and othe r environmental programs of interest to them. ICMA's Environmental SCAN is also published electronically on th e Internet. Access is free to anyone interested in local government issues. The ICMA site links el ectronically to EPA's Federal Register site so read ers interested in a regulation covered in the newsletter can immediately gain access to the actual text. As part of the project, ICMA has also conducted several workshops for small government offici als on regulatory and other environmental management topics. Guide to Federal Environmental Requirements for Small Governments : EPA also publishes and distributes the small communities guide, a refe rence handbook to help local officials become familiar with Federal environmental requirements that may apply to their jurisdictions. The guide explains Federal regulations in a simp le, straightforward manner. Mandated programs described in the guide include those for whic h small communities have major responsibilities, such as landfills, public power plants, and sewage and water systems. Regional Guides to Federal Environmental Requirements for Small Governments : EPA Region VIII publishes and distributes a small community reference handbook to help local officials in Colorado, Montana, North and South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming become familiar with Federal environmental requirements that may apply to thei r jurisdictions. The gui de includes up-to-date contact lists for State environmental programs. Consultations that Changed EPA Policies It is the Agency's policy to conduct outr each and seek accommodations, proportionate to the anticipated burden, to minimize adverse impact s on States, Tribes or local governments, in any rulemaking to which they are directly subject. Following are examples of when consultations resulted in s ubstantive changes to rules: 1. Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response EPA's Manifest Forms Rule created a truly uniform manifest for the very first time. The rule was promulgated in March 2005. EPA consulted with states through the Association of State and Te rritorial Solid Waste Management Officials (ASTSWMO) and had numerous state representatives on our internal EPA working group. We also consulted with the Department of Transportation, which also has an interest in transboundary movement of hazardous waste. Over a 10 year period, multiple meetings were held with state representatives to pursue development and implementation of a truly uniform hazardous waste manifest. This led to decisions on a general approach to be taken in developing the uniform manifest form. Subs equently, individual stat e representatives sat on our internal EPA working group over the 4 year period that the rule was under development. It 161 has always been OSWER policy to involve States in the developmen t of rules that affect their solid and hazardous waste programs. The regulated community urged development of a truly uniform manifest form to take the place of the current 25 different forms (one generic manifest form and 24 different state forms). The States wanted to make sure they coul d obtain necessary important information on non- federal hazardous wastes that ar e regulated in their States. EPA issued a regulation that required use of a single uniform hazardous waste manifest form to be used by all generators, transporters, and TSDFs (treatment, storage, and disposal facilities). This paves the way for development of an electronic manifest system that will save States, hazardous waste generators, and the wa ste management industry on the order of $100 million per year in operating expenses. 2. Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) The Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) issu ed a final rule (in January 2006) that streamlined the existing pesticide emergency exemption process based on recommendations from the States. Under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), EPA may issue emergency exemptions that allow unregistered us es of pesticides to address emergency pest conditions for a limited time. This action reduces the burden to States in the application process, allows for quicker emergency response, and provides more consistently equitable determinations of \"significant economic loss\" as the basis of an emergency, without compromising protections for huma n health and the environment. Applicants for pesticide emergency exempti ons, which are Federal and State Agencies responsible for pesticide regulator y authority, are affected by this final rule. Although federal agencies may apply for emergency exemptions, the vast majority of requests are from individual States for use by farmers to avert a pest-rel ated economic emergency. Consultations were conducted with the American Association of Pesticide Control Offi cials (AAPCO), the association that represents State leve l pesticide regulatory officials. The final rule was the culmination of near ly 10 years of outreach and consultations. After EPA held a workshop in 1996 to solicit st akeholder input to improve the emergency exemption process, AAPCO formed a Task Force to address emergency exemption issues with EPA. OPP consulted with the AAPCO Sec tion 18 Task Force numerous times during the rulemaking process. OPP also consulted with the State Federal FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation Group (SFIREG), established in 19 74 by cooperative agreement between EPA and AAPCO. SFIREG identifies, an alyzes and provides State comme nt on pesticide regulatory issues and provides a mechanism for ongoing exch ange of information about EPA and State pesticide programs. There are ei ght regularly scheduled meetings each year that offer State officials the opportunity to meet with us to disc uss issues including regula tions in progress. In response to a request from EPA in 2002, AAPCO submitted three recommendations to the Agency to streamline and improve the emergency exemption process. The final rule addressed two of the three recommendations. 162 AAPCO, comprised of OPP's State re gulatory partners, submitted specific recommendations based on their concerns th at arose during the consultations. They recommended basing the necessary \"significant economic loss\" finding on yield losses, rather than revenue, where appropriate, and allowing States to re-certify continuing emergencies. The two primary provisions in the final ru le were the direct result of the State recommendations coming out of the consultation process. The resulting regulatory revisions streamlined the application process for States and the review process for EPA, reducing the burden and expediting EPA's response to emergency pest situations. The final rule also revised the assessment of \"significant economic loss,\" providing for more cons istently equitable determinations to qualify for an emergency exemption. 163 "}
