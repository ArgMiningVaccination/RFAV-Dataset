The Queen's Medical Center recently took part in a drill on receiving the Pfizer vaccine. The drill helps prepare both pharmacy and medical staff for acceptance and storage of the vaccine, upon FDA approval. The drill included thermal containers with dry air packs, which is how the vaccine will be shipped upon approval. The packs can be replenished for up to 20 days before they need to be stored in freezers. Further drills are expected in the coming days. Dr. Kelly Withy, Director of the Hawai'i/Pacific Basin Area Health Education Center said, \"My colleagues across the state have put their lives on the line in order to care for Hawai'i's COVID-19 patients. The Emergency Use Authorization of COVID-19 vaccines would be a huge step forward in preventing further infection and protecting our healthcare workers. The steps we are taking today will help us ensure that when a vaccine is approved, Hawai'i will be ready to distribute the vaccine to priority groups, and eventually, the general public.\" An FDA committee is set to review the safety and efficacy data package for Pfizer's COVID-19 Vaccine on Dec. 10. They'll also review Moderna's vaccine on Dec. 17.
