We're here to remember how unlimited we really are. We're here to demystify the process of creating change - for ourselves and, ultimately, for our lives. We're here to learn about the science of possibility and the proof of what's possible - in the scientific measurements we're doing in our community, and through stories of personal change and transformation. When we change, our life changes. Our mission is to change individuals - so, ultimately, we can change the world. There is more to reality than this dream. And the truth is, we're greater than we think; more powerful than we know; more unlimited than we could ever dream. What Is the Work? There is no single answer - no right or wrong. It's a life filled with purpose, meaning, and vitality. It's moments of presence, gratitude, and joy. It's a personal practice - and the collective experience of people changing people. It transforms the mundane and touches the mystical. In this work, we use the latest scientific discoveries to build models of understanding and demystify what's possible for all of us. Based on more than 10 years of research, our scientifically proven methods teach us how to transform through various forms of meditation. The knowledge we gather - through study and practice - provides the basis for practical application, enabling us to produce meaningful change in our lives. A cornerstone of this work is: your personality creates your personal reality. Therefore, when you change, or your personality changes, your life changes. To create something new in our lives - or arrive at a new future - we must first change ourselves. The work is what we bring to it, every day. It's mastering ourselves to create a new reality from unlimited possibilities. The Work Is ... Healing We all have challenges and goals - around our health, our emotions, and our beliefs. Yet we are more than our bodies; more than our habitual thoughts, behaviors, and feelings. The evidence we've gathered through our scientific research and Stories of Transformation demonstrates it's possible to heal all types of conditions - sometimes, with a single intervention. The healing journey begins when we overcome our limitations, open our hearts, and experience a new future as if it is already ours. The process of overcoming is the process of becoming. The Work Is ... Learning Our practice is a process of demystifying the mystical, providing all the tools we need to make measurable changes in our lives. There are meditations, teachings, retreats, online courses, books, and gatherings for everyone at every point in the journey - and each builds on the others to deepen our understanding of the work. Using these tools of transformation, we learn to intentionally create states of being that unlock hidden potentials. The Work Is ... Community Our community members share a passion for the unknown and a desire to do the uncommon. Together, we support one another, heal one another, and shine for one another. Collective networks of observers, sharing the same consciousness and energy, determine reality. While we each have our own work to do, we know we create real, lasting change in the world when we come together as one heart and mind. The Work Is ... Rigorous Science For more than a decade, our scientific research team has conducted original research and closely observed participants at our retreats around the world. From heart and brain coherence to cellular metabolism ... from gene expression to immune regulation ... our findings demonstrate the effects of meditation on biology, showing real, measurable changes in people's health - and their lives. The Work Is ... Stories of Transformation Watch stories of personal breakthroughs, miraculous healings, profound transformations, and powerful creations from our community of students around the world. "}
