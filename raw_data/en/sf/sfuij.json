Your Board's approval is essential to providing uninterrupted services and continuity of care to clients. Your Board has traditionally approved this re quest in order to allow the department to negotiate final contracts with the approved budget allocations for the new fiscal year without negatively impacting the members of the community served by these CBOs. Your Board approved these contracts for Fiscal Year 202 1 on June 23, 2020 (Item No . 4, continuation of contracts from FY 20 20), and on January 12, 202 1 (Item No. 38, La Familia Counseling Services changed their name to The Alliance for Community Wellness) .

These program s deliver specialized services to adolescents and adults and include tailored programs for special populations such as women who are pregnant and/or parenting and older adults . ACBH is requesting that the Board waive the County 's competitive procurement process for services funded through Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant to cover those program that were no t recently awarded through a competitive procurement process . Total federal funding through this grant goes to a number of substance use prevention, treatment , and recovery residence programs and represents approximately five percent of the total funding i ncluded in this Board Letter. SELECTION CRITERIA ACBH released RFP for DMC -ODS Waiver services on February 8, 2018. There were 18 separate competitive processes under this RFP. Outreach for this RFP was conducted through the GSA website and vendor dis tribution lists, the ACBH website and community distribution lists. There were two bidders' conferences held on February 15 and 16, 2018. The County Selection Committee for each competitive process consisted of various subject matter experts from Alameda County Departments, such as Public Health, Social Services Agency, Probation and ACBH, as well as representatives from Oakland Unified School District, Kaiser Permanente, and surrounding Bay Area counties such as Solano, San Francisco and Contra Costa.

The RFP was advertised for 31 days using the General Services Agency (GSA) advertising guideline by posting on the ACBH and GSA websites.

However, a number of these non -profit CBO s have elected to participate in the SLEB program, and the SLEB certification number s and expiration dates are included in Attachment A for these providers.

Financing from one-time Medi -Cal settlements is being requested as a final adjustment to the ACBH Fiscal Year 2021 -22 Budget, per the attached Budget Tracking Fo rm.

Actual Cost Reimbursement Method Final reimbursement sha ll be made on the basis of Contractor's actual allowable costs less any applicable revenues collected from all other payment sources up to the Contract Maximum. 2. Negotiated Rate Reimbursement Method Final reimbursement shall be determined by multiplyin g the Contractor's negotiated rate(s), specified in Exhibit B -3: Method and Rate of Reimbursement (Rate Sheet), by the actual allowable units of service provided, less any deductible revenues collected by Contractor from all other payers, subject to the ma ximum program funding amount. 3. Provisional Rate Reimbursement Method Unless otherwise approved in writing by ACBH, ACBH will base Contractor's final reimbursement on actual cost per unit (CPU) of service up to the County Contract Maximum Rate (CCMR), le ss any applicable revenues collected from all other payers, or Contractor's usual and customary charges during the contract period subject to the maximum program funding amount. Contractors final reimbursement is subject to the maximum allowable CPU of service limitations established and subject to revision by the State of California. Should Contractor's actual CPU unit of service exceed the State's maximum allowable CPU of service, Contractor's reimbursable cost will be reduced to the limits mandated b y the State. SUD EXHIBIT B PAGE 8 OF 16 Should Contractor's actual CPU of service exceed the CCMR or other ACBH rate cap, Contractor's reimbursable cost will be reduced to the CCMR or other ACBH rate cap times allowable units of service. 4. Fee for Se rvice Final reimbursement shall be determined by multiplying the fee -for-service rate(s), specified in Exhibit B -3 by the actual units of service provided, subject to maximum program funding amount. Any share of cost or revenues collected from all other payers shall be deducted from the net reimbursable cost. Final reimbursement rates shall be determined by Contractor's Year -End Cost Report. Fee -for-service rate(s) may be subject to renegotiation after ACBH's review of Contractor's Year -End Cost Report. Programs Funded Entirely by Drug Medi -Cal (Opioid Treatment Programs) ACBH will base final reimbursement on actual allowable units of service multiplied by the fee for service rate specified in Exhibit B -3. For providers with two or more programs, in th e event that the net reimbursable cost for any single program is less than the program maximum funding allocation, ACBH may apply or move the underutilized funding to provider's other programs whose net costs have exceeded the maximum funding allocation, a s long as the movement of funding does not: i. Impact the amount of required County match; and/or ii. Move services between age -based Systems of Care (i.e., Adolescent, Adults, and/or iii. Move services between different service modalities (i.e. outpatient versus residential); and/or iv. Modify an allocation that has been set by a competitive procurement request for proposals (RFP) process; and/or v. Impact a categorical allocation and/or funding stream for a particular program/RU including but not limited to grants, CalWORKs ; and/or vi. Shift funds between programs/RUs that have a different method of reimbursement such as provisional rate, negotiated rate or actual cost; and/or vii. Result in a program expansion of greater than 25 percent for the smaller program/RU when there is a fun ds transfer from a larger program/RU into a smaller program/RU; and/or viii. Cause a cumulative transfer of funds from numerous programs/RUs to be greater than 20 percent of the total contract allocation during the contract term. 5. Final Reimbursement Final reimbursement is made after County's submission of an acceptable Year -End Cost Report to the State.

Rate of reimbursement may be subject to renegotiation after ACBH review of Contractor's prior fiscal year Year -End Cost Report. Final reimbursement rates shall be determined by Contractor's Year -End Cost Report. See Exhibit B -3: Method and Rate of Reimbursement to identify which of the following method(s) apply to your contract: 1. Actual Cost Reimbursement Method Final reimbursement shall be made on the basis of Contractor's actual allowable costs less any applicable revenues collected from all other payment sources up to the Contract Maximum. 2. Negotiated Rate Reimbursement Method Final reimbursement shall be determined by multiplying the Contr actor's negotiated rate(s), specified in Exhibit B -3: Method and Rate of Reimbursement (Rate Sheet), by the actual allowable units of service provided, less any deductible revenues collected by Contractor from all other payers, subject to the maximum progr am funding amount. 3. Provisional Rate Reimbursement Method Unless otherwise approved in writing by ACBH, ACBH will base Contractor's final reimbursement on actual cost per unit (CPU) of service up to the County Contract Maximum Rate (CCMR), less any appl icable revenues collected from all other payers, or Contractor's usual and customary charges during the contract period subject to the maximum program funding amount. Contractors final reimbursement is subject to the maximum allowable CPU of service limitations established and subject to revision by the State of California. Should Contractor's actual CPU unit of service exceed the State's maximum allowable CPU of service, Contractor's reimbursable cost will be reduced to the limits mandated by the State . SUD EXHIBIT B PAGE 8 OF 16 Should Contractor's actual CPU of service exceed the CCMR or other ACBH rate cap, Contractor's reimbursable cost will be reduced to the CCMR or other ACBH rate cap times allowable units of service. 4. Fee for Service Final reimbursement shall be determined by multiplying the fee -for-service rate(s), specified in Exhibit B -3 by the actual units of service provided, subject to maximum program funding amount. Any share of cost or revenues collected from all other payers shall be deducted from the net reimbursable cost. Final reimbursement rates shall be determined by Contractor's Year -End Cost Report. Fee-for-service rate(s) may be subject to renegotiation after ACBH's review of Contractor's Year -End Cost Report. Programs F unded Entirely by Drug Medi -Cal (Opioid Treatment Programs) ACBH will base final reimbursement on actual allowable units of service multiplied by the fee for service rate specified in Exhibit B -3. For providers with two or more programs, in the event tha t the net reimbursable cost for any single program is less than the program maximum funding allocation, ACBH may apply or move the underutilized funding to provider's other programs whose net costs have exceeded the maximum funding allocation, as long as t he movement of funding does not: i. Impact the amount of required County match; and/or ii. Move services between age -based Systems of Care (i.e., Adolescent, Adults, and/or iii. Move services between different service modalities (i.e. outpatient versus residential); a nd/or iv. Modify an allocation that has been set by a competitive procurement request for proposals (RFP) process; and/or v. Impact a categorical allocation and/or funding stream for a particular program/RU including but not limited to grants, CalWORKs; and/or vi. Shift funds between programs/RUs that have a different method of reimbursement such as provisional rate, negotiated rate or actual cost; and/or vii. Result in a program expansion of greater than 25 percent for the smaller program/RU when there is a funds transfer from a larger program/RU into a smaller program/RU; and/or viii. Cause a cumulative transfer of funds from numerous programs/RUs to be greater than 20 percent of the total contract allocation during the contract term. 5. Final Reimbursement Final reimbursement is made after County's submission of an acceptable Year -End Cost Report to the State. The term \"acceptable\" shall be understood as a Year -End Cost that has been accepted by the State. Should the Contractor's final maximum allowable SUD EXHIBIT B PAGE 9 OF 16 reimbursement be less than the total interim payments made pursuant to submitted invoices, Contractor agrees to remit said difference to County within 60 calendar days of Contractor's receipt of Final Contract Settlement, unless otherwise approved by ACBH. 6. Audit Contractor's records shall be subject to audit and disallowances by all applicable County, State and Federal authorities.

These programs will also be specified as RFP programs on the Exhibit B -3: Method and Rate of Reimbursement for a minimum of three years. Contractor shall implement new program(s) resulting from RFP award according to the budget and deliverables in Contractor's bid submission. Contractor shall not revise the b udget or deliverables prior to program implementation without prior written consent from ACBH. Contractor may request changes during the first year after program implementation provided such changes will not result in a material difference in the scope of work awarded through the RFP. Contractor must submit these change requests in writing to their Fiscal and Program Contract Managers, and ACBH is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving/denying all requested changes. Budget revision changes can b e requested by Contractor after the first full year of program implementation. Requests must be submitted in writing to the Fiscal Contract Manager. If approved by ACBH, funding augmentations must be submitted to and approved by the Board of Supervisors pr ior to being added to the contract. b).

Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) COLAs are at the County's discretion. If, during the term of this Contract, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors approves a COLA, the increase may be retroactive to July 1 of the current contract year. 5. Available Resources Parties to this Contract acknowledge the uncertainty of the funding resources support ing this Contract, which may impact the ACBH dollar allocation for contracted services. Should it be necessary to adjust the amount of the funding during the term of SUD EXHIBIT B PAGE 7 OF 16 this Contract, ACBH shall notify Contractor at least thirt y (30) days prior to the effective date of the adjustment. C. Cost Settlement/Final Payment Provisions A Cost Settlement at the end of the term of this agreement between ACBH and Contractor will be considered an interim settlement until all Federal, State, and County audits and appeals have been completed. Contractor shall account for each program separately and provide specific cost centers and audit trails for each program and service sit e per the cost report instructions set forth by the California Department of Health Care Services and ACBH. Rate of reimbursement may be subject to renegotiation after ACBH review of Contractor's prior fiscal year Year -End Cost Report. Final reimbursement rates shall be determined by Contractor's Year -End Cost Report. See Exhibit B -3: Method and Rate of Reimbursement to identify which of the following method(s) apply to your contract: 1. Actual Cost Reimbursement Method Final reimbursement shall be made on the basis of Contractor's actual allowable costs less any applicable revenues collected from all other payment sources up to the Contract Maximum. 2. Negotiated Rate Reimbursement Method Final reimbursement shall be determined by multiplying the Contr actor's negotiated rate(s), specified in Exhibit B -3: Method and Rate of Reimbursement (Rate Sheet), by the actual allowable units of service provided, less any deductible revenues collected by Contractor from all other payers, subject to the maximum progr am funding amount. 3. Provisional Rate Reimbursement Method Unless otherwise approved in writing by ACBH, ACBH will base Contractor's final reimbursement on actual cost per unit (CPU) of service up to the County Contract Maximum Rate (CCMR), less any appl icable revenues collected from all other payers, or Contractor's usual and customary charges during the contract period subject to the maximum program funding amount. Contractors final reimbursement is subject to the maximum allowable CPU of service limitations established and subject to revision by the State of California. Should Contractor's actual CPU unit of service exceed the State's maximum allowable CPU of service, Contractor's reimbursable cost will be reduced to the limits mandated by the State . SUD EXHIBIT B PAGE 8 OF 16 Should Contractor's actual CPU of service exceed the CCMR or other ACBH rate cap, Contractor's reimbursable cost will be reduced to the CCMR or other ACBH rate cap times allowable units of service. 4. Fee for Service Final reimbursement shall be determined by multiplying the fee -for-service rate(s), specified in Exhibit B -3 by the actual units of service provided, subject to maximum program funding amount. Any share of cost or revenues collected from all other payers shall be deducted from the net reimbursable cost. Final reimbursement rates shall be determined by Contractor's Year -End Cost Report. Fee-for-service rate(s) may be subject to renegotiation after ACBH's review of Contractor's Year -End Cost Report. Programs F unded Entirely by Drug Medi -Cal (Opioid Treatment Programs) ACBH will base final reimbursement on actual allowable units of service multiplied by the fee for service rate specified in Exhibit B -3. For providers with two or more programs, in the event tha t the net reimbursable cost for any single program is less than the program maximum funding allocation, ACBH may apply or move the underutilized funding to provider's other programs whose net costs have exceeded the maximum funding allocation, as long as t he movement of funding does not: i. Impact the amount of required County match; and/or ii. Move services between age -based Systems of Care (i.e., Adolescent, Adults, and/or iii. Move services between different service modalities (i.e. outpatient versus residential); a nd/or iv. Modify an allocation that has been set by a competitive procurement request for proposals (RFP) process; and/or v. Impact a categorical allocation and/or funding stream for a particular program/RU including but not limited to grants, CalWORKs; and/or vi. Shift funds between programs/RUs that have a different method of reimbursement such as provisional rate, negotiated rate or actual cost; and/or vii. Result in a program expansion of greater than 25 percent for the smaller program/RU when there is a funds transfer from a larger program/RU into a smaller program/RU; and/or viii. Cause a cumulative transfer of funds from numerous programs/RUs to be greater than 20 percent of the total contract allocation during the contract term. 5. Final Reimbursement Final reimbursement is made after County's submission of an acceptable Year -End Cost Report to the State. The term \"acceptable\" shall be understood as a Year -End Cost that has been accepted by the State. Should the Contractor's final maximum allowable SUD EXHIBIT B PAGE 9 OF 16 reimbursement be less than the total interim payments made pursuant to submitted invoices, Contractor agrees to remit said difference to County within 60 calendar days of Contractor's receipt of Final Contract Settlement, unless otherwise approved by ACBH. 6. Audit Contractor's records shall be subject to audit and disallowances by all applicable County, State and Federal authorities. Contractor shall account for each program separately and provide specific cost centers and aud it trails for each program. Cost Settlements will be considered interim until all County, State and Federal audits and appeals have been completed.
