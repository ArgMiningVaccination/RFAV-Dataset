About Acupuncture Acupuncture is a natural treatment used in holistic medicine. It causes relatively few side effects and has been a practice used in human medicine since the origin of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It's also been used on animals for quite some time as well. An acupuncture session consists of inserting needles in certain spots in your horse's body, based on his or her particular issue. The needles are very thin, so they don't cause pain. In Chinese medicine, it's thought that the needles stimulate the flow of energy, which they refer to as qi. The practitioner specifically applies the needles to different meridians that are aligned with different areas that could benefit the health issue. In Western medicine, practitioners believe that acupuncture points focus on the connective tissue, nerves, and muscles. Additionally, it's also thought that the needles stimulate the body to produce certain natural painkillers. What We Use Acupuncture For In many of our patients with pain, we recommend acupuncture, in particular, for soft tissue pain. Besides pain relief, acupuncture may also have an impact on inflammation, which is ideal for our patients with acute injuries and arthritis. It's thought that acupuncture may also help with the immune system. Dr. Christy Haines especially finds it effective for senior pets who are weak in the hind end and for rehabbing injuries to help build back muscle. Your pet may benefit from acupuncture's ability to increase microcirculation. This refers to the circulation of blood through your pet's smallest blood vessels -- the venules, metarterioles, terminal arterioles, and capillaries. They're located throughout your pet's body including in his or her organ tissue. We may recommend acupuncture for other reasons as well. Evaluation Before Acupuncture Our practitioner performs an evaluation before conducting acupuncture to ensure it's safe for your pet. The first part of this evaluation consists of gathering information about your pet's medical history. We want to make sure he or she doesn't have any conditions that acupuncture could make worse. Our practitioner will also conduct a visual examination and assess the location of the issue. We won't use acupuncture if the root of your pet's pain is from a fracture or infectious condition. We also can't apply the needles in an open wound. For these issues, your pet will need to have another treatment better suited for his or her issue. What to Expect During Acupuncture Once our practitioner determines that acupuncture is safe for your pet, they will determine the cause of your pet's pain or other symptoms and decide if acupuncture could benefit your pet. During the procedure, the practitioner applies ultra-thin needles into specific parts of your pet's body. The needles consist of stainless steel and are flexible. Additionally, we only use fresh needles to avoid the risk of infecting your pet. Sometimes, our patients only require one treatment if they have an acute condition. However, in most cases, between three to five are necessary. For animals with degenerative conditions, or to prevent recurring issues, your pet may benefit from routine acupuncture sessions. Acupuncture may help lessen your pet's pain and other symptoms without side effects. Generally, the treatment is safe. Plus, our practitioner tailors the treatment to your pet's particular needs.

About Shockwave Therapy Focused extracorporeal shockwave systems are still the only medical technology capable of generating a mechanical impulse within the body, which is precise, has different penetration depths and is entirely non-invasive. Extracorporeal shockwaves function as mechanical stressors which are able to effect biochemical changes in living tissue. Numerous scientific studies and publications have confirmed the efficacy of ESWT and of trigger point treatment and the use of focused piezo shockwaves for both. BENEFITS OF SHOCK WAVE THERAPY - Stimulates microcirculation - Releases \"substance P\" - Releases nitrogen monoxide (NO), which contributes to vasodilation, increases metabolic activity and angiogenesis, and exerts an anti-inflammatory effect - Antibacterial effect - Releases growth factors (in blood vessels, epithelium, bone, collagen, etc.) - Stimulates stem cells - Stimulates lubricin production - Globally unique range of therapy sources for your individual area of application. - Quiet application - Painless coupling - No sedation usually required. - Supports the animal's healing processes - with no side effects. - Minutely adjustable penetration depth of up to 100 mm at the focal center. - Mobile flexible treatment with our unit trolley. - Precisely defined focus - perfect for localizing and treating pain points. - Uniquely long, guaranteed service life of therapy sources. About Photobiomodulation Therapy Photobiomodulation therapy is defined as a form of light therapy that utilizes non-ionizing light sources, including lasers, light emitting diodes, and/or broadband light, in the visible (400 - 700 nm) and near-infrared (700 - 1100 nm) electromagnetic spectrum. It is a nonthermal process involving endogenous chromophores eliciting photophysical (i.e., linear and nonlinear) and photochemical events at various biological scales. This process results in beneficial therapeutic outcomes including but not limited to the alleviation of pain or inflammation, immunomodulation, and promotion of wound healing and tissue regeneration. The term photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy is now being used by researchers and practitioners instead of terms such as low level laser therapy (LLLT), cold laser, or laser therapy. While we did not feel it would be appropriate to show what may be considered gruesome photos in a public newsletter, we have photos from injury through healing that show the incredible results given by our Pegasus IV photobiomodulation system. If you are considering laser therapy for your pet, or your doctor recommended it and you wish to see photos, please email us and we'd be happy to email them upon request. About Chiropractic Pet Care Chiropractic care focuses predominantly on the musculoskeletal system - the network of bones, muscles and connective tissues that create form and facilitate movement. By realigning the musculoskeletal system, and in particular the spine, chiropractors have found that it is possible to improve a animal's mobility, reduce their pain and enhance their overall health and well-being, as well as the quality of their life. Our chiropractic treatments can help with: - Arthritis - Chronic pain conditions - Degenerative disc disease - Gastrointestinal problems - Healing after trauma, specifically tissue healing and muscle growth - Hip dysplasia - Incontinence - Mobility issues, such as difficulty going up or down stairs - Muscle spasms - Nerve problems - Reproductive issues - Respiratory problems - Separation anxiety - Skin problems like allergic dermatitis and ringworm - Stiffness and tension - Stress caused by travel - Travel sickness - Diagnosed pathologies such as hip dysplasia and CCL rupture. - Skin problems such "}
