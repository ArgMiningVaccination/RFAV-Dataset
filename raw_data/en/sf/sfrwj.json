That inter\u00ad pretation stated that the disclosures and authorization required by \u00a7 226.4(a) (5) and (6) in order to exclude certain insurance premiums from the finance charge may be made in a statement separate from the regu\u00ad lar Truth in Lending disclosure form. You ask whether these disclosures may be placed on the reverse side of the same sheet of paper used for the regular Truth in Lending disclosures. It is staff's opinion that this would comply with the requirements of Regulation Z. FC-0037 was not meant to suggest that if the disclosures are mad separately from the Truth in Lending dis closures, they must actually be made on separate piece of paper. Therefore, printin of the disclosures on the reverse side of th disclosure statement would suffice. This is an official staff interpretation c Regulation Z issued in accordance wit: \u00a7 226.1(d) (3) of the regulation and is limitein its applicability to the facts outlined herein.

[FR Doc.77-9902 Filed 4-l-77;8:45 am] Title 14\u2014 Aeronautics and Avions Marcel Dassault/Breguet Aviation (AMD/BA) Falcon 10 Airplanes There have been reports that tailpipe attachment flanges on Avions Marcel Dassault/Breguet Aviation Falcon 10 air\u00ad planes 'equipped with Grumman tailpipe P/N F10A5B10003-7 are experiencing cracks of a nature and extent that could result in detachment of the tailpipe from the airplane. Loss of a tailpipe would jeopardize the safety of persons and prop\u00ad erty on the ground. Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other air\u00ad planes of the same type design, an air\u00ad worthiness directive is being issued which requires replacement of the tailpipes. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regula\u00ad tion, it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. (Secs. 313(a), 601, and 603, Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1354(a), 1421, and 1423); (49 U.S.C. 1655(c).) In consideration of the foregoing and pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator (14 CFR 11.89), \u00a7 39.13 of Part 39 of the Federal Avia\u00ad tion Regulations is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive. Avions M arcel D assault /Breguet A vi\u00ad ation (AMD BA) Applies to Falcon 10 airplanes,. certificated in all cate\u00ad gories, equipped with Grumman tail\u00ad FI 0A5B10003-7, installed without back-up ring, P/N F10A5B10606- 11. Compliance is required as indicated, unless already accomplished. To prevent the possible loss of the tail\u00ad pipe, accomplish the following: (a) For tailpipes having more than 750 hours time in service on the effective date of this AD, comply with paragraph (c) of this AD within 90 days or 150 hours time inservice after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. (b) For tailpipes having 750 hours or less time in service on the effective date of this AD, comply with paragraph (c) of this AD prior to the accumulation of 900 hours total time in service. (c) Replace tailpipe, P N F10A5B10003-7, with a new part of the same part number, or with a serviceable part of improved design, P/N F'l0A5RDB20217-3, and in either case install with back-up ring P/N F10A5B10606-11 (Falcon 10 Service Bulletin No. 0129, dated December 21, 1976, covers this subject.) This amendment becomes effective April 18, 1977. Note.\u2014The Federal Aviation Administra\u00ad tion has determined that this document does not contain a major proposal requiring preparation of an Economic Impact State\u00ad ment under Executive Order 11821, as amended by Executive Order- 11949, and OMB Circular A\u2014 107. Issued in Washington, D.C. on March 28, 1977. J. A. Ferrarese , Acting Director, Flight Standards AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administra- tion/DOT(FAA). ACTION: Final Rule. SUMMARY: This amendment to Part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 39) adds a new Airworthi\u00ad ness Directive (AD) applicable to certain Beech Models C90 and E90 airplanes. It requires inspection of the left hand rud\u00ad der cable for adequate clearance between it and the electrical relay panel. Inade\u00ad quate clearance could cause the rudder cable to strike the electrical components and be damaged by electrical arcing re\u00ad sulting in failure of the rudder cable and loss of airplane rudder control. Where clearance is inadequate, the AD requires relocation or modification of the electri\u00ad cal relay panel and the replacement of damaged rudder cables. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 11, 1977, to all persons except those to whom it has al\u00ad ready been made effective by air mail letter from the Federal Aviation Admin\u00ad istration dated March 14, 1977. ADDRESSES- Beechcraft Service In\u00ad struction 0896 may be obtained from Beech Aircraft Corporation, Wichita, Kansas 67201. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17866 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CON\u00ad TACT: E. L. Tankesley, Aerospace Engi\u00ad neer, Engineering and Manufacturing Branch, Federal Aviation Administra\u00ad tion, Central Region, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; telephone (816) 374-3446. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: There have been reports in which the left hand rudder cable was damaged by electrical arcing when it came in contact with electrical components on the relay panel located under the left hand cock\u00ad pit floorboard on Beech Models C90 and E90 airplanes. This condition can result when there is inadequate clearance be\u00ad tween the rudder cable and the relay panel. A damaged rudder cable could fail and result in the loss of airplane control under critical flight situations. The reports showed that severe cable damage had occurred. In one of the re\u00ad ports only a single strand of cable re\u00ad mained intact. Therefore, the FAA de\u00ad termined that an unsafe condition of an emergency nature existed which required immediate corrective action and there\u00ad by determined that notice and public procedure thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest. Ac\u00ad cordingly, all known registered owners of affected aircraft were notified of the emergency AD by air mail letter dated March 14, 1977. Since the unsafe condi\u00ad tion is likely to exist or develop in other airplanes of the same type design, an AD is being issued applicable to Beech Models C90 and E90 making it effective as to all persons who did not receive the AD letter notification. The AD requires, prior to further flight, inspection of the left hand rudder cable to determine if at least % inch clearance exists between it and the electrical components located on the relay panel. If inadequate clearance is found, the AD further requires modifica\u00ad tion or relocation of the relay panel, in\u00ad spection of the rudder cable for damage and its replacement if damaged. On those aircraft where the inspection shows that clearance is more than % inch but less than % inch, correction is required within 25 hours' time in service after the effective date of this AD. Pro\u00ad cedures for accomplishing the AD in\u00ad spection and modification of the air\u00ad craft, if required, are provided in Beechcraft Service Instructions No. 0896. Accordingly, \u00a7 39.13 of Part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR \u00a7 39.13) is amended effective April 11, 1977, by adding the following new AD: Beech . Applies to Models LW- 222 and LW-223) airplanes. To assure adequate clearance between the left hand rudder cable and the electrical components on the relay panel located under the left hand cockpit floorboard, accomplish the following : (A) Prior to further flight inspect the left hand rudder control cable under the left hand cockpit floorboard in accordance with Steps 1 through 4 of Beechcraft Service In\u00ad structions 0896, or later approved revisions, to determine that at least % inch clearance exists between the rudder control cable andRULES AND REGULATIONS all electrical components located on the relay panel. (B) If the inspection required by Para\u00ad graph A shows that the clearance is less than % inch, prior to further flight: 1. If possible, relocate the relay panel'to provide at least % inch clearance, or if the relay panel cannot be relocated to provide at least % inch clearance, modify the panel in accordance with Steps 6 through 13 of Beechcraft Service Instructions 0896, or later approved revisions, and 2. Inspect the rudder cable to determine if it has been damaged by coming in contact with the electrical components. If the cable has been damaged, install a new cable, Beech P/N 50-524438-17, or an equivalent cable fabricated in accordance with acceptable FAA standards (AC 43.13-1A). (C) If the inspection required by Para\u00ad graph A shows that the clearance is between % and % inches, within 25. hours' time in service after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the requirements of Paragraphs B (l) and B (2 ). (D) If the inspection required by Para\u00ad graph A shows that the clearance is % inch or more, make an entry in the aircraft's maintenance records indicating that this AD has been accomplished and the airplane may be returned to service. (E) Airplanes may be flown in accordance with FAR 21.197 to a location where the needed' electrical system modification or rud\u00ad der cable replacement required by this AD may be accomplished.

Therefore, the AD is being superseded by a new AD that re\u00ad quires a finite life of 6,860 hours 36124 when used with un\u00ad faired paddles, clarifies the 2,500 hours service life after repair per Hiller Avia\u00ad tion Service Bulletin No. 36-1, Revision 2, dated June 19,1974, and continues the 100 hour inspection of AD 74-21-05. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 7, 1977. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Kyle L. Olsen, Executive Secretary, Airworthiness Directive Review Board, Federal Aviation Administration. Western Region, P.O. Box 92007 Worldway Postal Center, Los Angeles, California 90009. Telephone: (213) 536-6351. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. On October 4, 1974 the FAA issued air\u00ad worthiness directive (AD) 74-21-05 (Amendment 393-1990, 39 FR 36855) on Hiller UH-12 helicopters, which required inspections of the control rotor blade spar tube for cracks, corrosion or exces\u00ad sive wear of the outboard retention bolts; and replacement or repair, if nec\u00ad essary. This AD was required because of fatigue cracks in the control rotor blade spar tube initiating at the outboard at\u00ad tachment (to the cuff) bolt hole which have propagated completely around the spar tube causing the blade assembly to separate from the cuff which will result in loss of control of the helicopter. Recent fatigue tests conducted by Hiller Aviation have established a serv\u00ad ice life of 6,860 hours for Hiller control rotor cuff, Hiller P/N 36124 when used with unfaired paddles. Therefore, the AD is being superseded by a new AD to require that the Hiller P/N 36124 cuff be taken out of service before reaching 6,860 hours time in service. The new AD will also clarify the 2,500 hour service life after repair, and will retain the 100 hour inspections required by AD 74-21-05. Accordingly, \u00a7 39.13 of Part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 39) is amended by adding the fol\u00ad lowing new airworthiness directive : Hiller in all cateogries.RULES AND REGULATIONS Compliance required as indicated, unless already accomplished. To detect cracks in the control rotor blade spar tube and cuff and to establish a service life of 6,860 hours for Hiller P/N 36124 cuff used with unfaired paddles accomplish the following: (a) Within the next 100 hours time in service after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished within the last 100 hours time in service and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 100 hours time in service from the last inspection, inspect, re\u00ad place or repair the control rotor blade spar tube and cuff in accordance with Hiller Aviation Service Bulletin No. 36-1, Revision 2, dated June 19, 1974, or later FAA-approved revisions. (b) After any repair is accomplished in accordance with Hiller Aviation Service Bulletin No. 36-1, Revision 2, dated June 19, 1974 or later FAA-approved revisions, the control rotor blade spar tube (faired and unfaired) and cuff must be retired before 2,500 additional hours time in service after rework or when the current approved total service life (total service life before repair plus service life after repair) is reached, whichever comes first. ~- (c) Fabric covered, metal covered, faired and unfaired' control rotor blades are not interchangeable and must not be intermixed. (d) For Hiller P/N 36124 cuffS used with unfaired paddles. (1) Cuffs with more than 6,660 hours time in service, remove and replace with a serviceable part within 200 hours time in service after the effective date of this AD. (2) Cuffs with less than 8,660 hours time in service, remove and replace with a serv\u00ad iceable part prior to 6,860 hours time in service. (3) For cuffs for which the prior service history cannot be documented, within the next 25 hours time in service after the ef\u00ad fective date of this AD, remove and discard the cuff from service. (e ) . Equivalent inspection procedures and repair procedures for Hiller P/N 36124,cuff when used only with unfaired paddles may be approved by the Chief, Aircraft Engineer\u00ad ing Division, FAA Western Region. (f ) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR's 21.197 and 21.199 to operate helicopters to a base for accom\u00ad plishment of the inspections required by this AD.

C :LR :T SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document contains interim in\u00ad come tax regulations under part VT of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. These amend\u00ad ments conform the Temporary Income Tax Regulations under the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (26 CFR Part 7) to section 2122 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 1914). They are issued under the authority contained in sections 190 and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code ofRULES AND REGULATIONS 1954 (90 Stat. 1914 and 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 190 and 7805). In addition, the regulations promulgated in this docu-_ ment are proposed to be prescribed as final Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR P a rti) under section 190 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The amendments are proposed to conform the Income Tax Regulations to section 2122 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 1914). They are also to be issued under the authority contained in sections 190 and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (90 Stat. 1914 and 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 190 and 7805). Ex planatio n of Provisions Section 2122 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 added section 190 to the Code. Section 190 provides that a taxpayer may elect to deduct certain amounts paid or incurred by him in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1976, and before January 1, 1980, for qualified architectural and transportation bar\u00ad rier removal expenses. The deduction is allowed for certain expenses for the pur\u00ad pose of making any facility, or public transportation vehicle, owned or leased by the taxpayer for use in connection with his trade or business more acces\u00ad sible to, or usable by, handicapped or elderly individuals. Under the interim regulations, the term \"facility\" means all or any portion of buildings, structures, equipment, roads, walks, parking lots, or similar real or personal property. Further, a \"public transportation vehicle\" is defined as a vehicle, such as a bus, a railroad car, or other conveyance, whether publicly or privately owned, which provides to the public general or special transportation service. This includes service rendered to the customers of a taxpayer who is not in the trade or business of, rendering transportation services. The term \"hand\u00ad icapped individual\" means any individual who has (1) a physical or mental dis\u00ad ability (including, but not limited to, blindness or deafness) which for that individual constitutes or results in a functional limitation to employment, or (2) a physical or mental impairment (in\u00ad cluding, but not limited to, a sight or hearing impairment) which substantially limits one or more of the individual's major life activities. Examples of these activities are performing manual tasks, walking, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. An \" elderly individual\" is one age 65 or over. To qualify for the deduction, the tax\u00ad payer must establish, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner or his delegate, that the removal of a barrier conforms a facility or public transportation ve\u00ad hicle to one or more of the standards set forth in the interim regulations. The interim regulations also provide that qualified expenses include only expenses specifically attributable to the removal of an existing architectural or transpor\u00ad tation barrier. These expenses do not in\u00ad clude any part of an expense in connec\u00ad tion with the construction or compre\u00ad hensive renovation of a facility or pub\u00ad lic transportation vehicle or the normal replacement of depreciable property.. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRILThe amount deductible under section 190 for any taxable year is limited to $25,000. Under the interim regulations, the maximum deduction for a taxpayer (including an affiliated group of corpo\u00ad rations filing a consolidated return) for any taxable year is $25,000. The $25,000 limitation applies to a partnership and to each partner. The interim regulations further provide that expenditures for a taxable year in excess of this amount are to be treated as capital expenditures and constitute adjustments to basis under section 1016(a). A special rule applies where a partner's expenditures exceed $25,000. The election to deduct qualified archi\u00ad tectural and transportation barrier re\u00ad moval expenses is made by claiming the deduction as a separate item identified as such on the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year for which the election applies. The return must be filed not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return (including extensions). Once made, an election is irrevocable and applies to all qualified expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year up to the limitation. If such expenditures exceed $25,000, the tax\u00ad payer elects which expenditures com\u00ad prise those deducted. An electing tax\u00ad payer must have available records and documentation of all the facts necessary to determine the amount deductible pur\u00ad suant to the election, as well as the amount of any adjustment to basis re\u00ad quired to -be made for expenditures ex\u00ad ceeding the $25,000 limit. Statutory Concurrence The Architectural and Transporta\u00ad tion Barriers Compliance Board has con\u00ad curred in the standards set forth in this interim regulation. Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing Before adoption of the final regula\u00ad tions proposed in this document, consid\u00ad eration will be given to any written com\u00ad ments that are submitted (preferably six copies) to the Commissioner of In\u00ad ternal Revenue. All comments will be available for public inspection and copy\u00ad ing. A public hearing will be held upon written request to the Commissioner by any person who has submitted written 'comments. If a public hearing is held, notice of the time and place will be pub\u00ad lished in the Federal Register . Drafting Inform ation The principal author of this regulation was John M. Coulter, Jr. of the Legisla\u00ad tion and Regulations Division of the Of\u00ad fice of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service. However, personnel from other offices of the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department participated in developing the regulation, both on matters of substance and style. Adoption of Am endm ents to the Regulations Accordingly, the following interim regulations are adopted: 1. Section 7.190-1 is added to read as set forth below. 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 17871 \u00a7 7.190\u2014 1 Expenditures to remove ar\u00ad chitectural and transportation bar\u00ad riers to the handicapped and elderly. (a) In general. Under section 190 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, a taxpayer may elect, in the manner pro\u00ad vided in \u00a7 7.190-3 of this chapter, to de\u00ad duct certain amounts paid or incurred by him in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1976, and before January 1, 1980, for qualified architec\u00ad tural and transportation barrier removal expenses (as defined in \u00a7 7.190-2 (b) of this chapter). In the case of a partner\u00ad ship, the election shall be made by the partnership. The election applies to ex\u00ad penditures paid or incurred during the taxable year which (but for the election) are chargeable to capital account. (b) Limitation. The maximum deduc\u00ad tion for a taxpayer (including an affili\u00ad ated group of corporations filing a con\u00ad solidated return) for any taxable year is $25,000. The $25,000 limitation applies to a partnership and to each partner. Expenditures paid or incurred in a tax\u00ad able year in excess of the amount de\u00ad ductible under section 190 for such tax\u00ad able year are capital expenditures and are adjustments to basis under section 1016(a). A partner must combine his distributive share of the partnership's deductible expenditures (after applica\u00ad tion of the $25,000 limitation the part\u00ad nership that partner's dis\u00ad tributive share of deductible expendi\u00ad tures from any other partnership plus that partner's own section 190 expendi\u00ad tures, if any (if he makes the election with respect to his own expenditures), and apply the partner's $25,000 limita\u00ad tion to the combined total to determine the aggregat6 amount deductible by that partner. In so doing, the partner may al\u00ad locate the partner's $25,000 limitation among the partner's own section 190 expenditures and the partner's distribu\u00ad tive share of partnership dedctible ex\u00ad penditures in any manner. If such allo\u00ad cation results in all or a portion of the partner's distributive share of a partner\u00ad ship's deductible expenditures not being an allowable deduction by the partner, the partnership may capitalize such un\u00ad allowable portion by an appropriate ad\u00ad justment to the basis of the relevant partnership property under section 1016. For purposes of adjustments to the basis of properties held by a partnership, how\u00ad ever, it shall be presumed that each part\u00ad ner's distributive share of partnership deductible expenditures (after applica\u00ad tion of the $25,000 limitation at the part\u00ad nership level) was allowable in full to the partner. This presumption can be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that all or any portion of a partner's distributive share of the part\u00ad nership section 190 deduction was not allowable as a deduction to the partner because it exceeded that partner's $25,- 000 limitation as allocated by him. For example, suppose fpr 1978 A's distribu\u00ad tive share of the ABC partnership's de\u00ad ductible section 190 expenditures (after application of the $25,000 limitation at the partnership level) is $15,000. A also made section 190 expenditures of $20,000in 1978 which he elects to deduct. A al\u00ad locates $10,000 of his $25,000 limitation to his distributive share of the ABC ex\u00ad penditures and $15,000 to his own ex\u00ad penditures. A may capitalize the excess $5,000 of his own expenditures. In addi\u00ad tion, if ABC obtains from A evidence which meets the requisite burden of proof, it may capitalize the $5,000 of A's distributive share which is not allowable as a deduction to A. 2. Section 7.190-2 is added to read as set forth below. \u00a7 7.190\u2014 2 Definitions.

The re\u00ad quirements of this subparagraph are: (i) A substantial barrier to the access to or use of a facility or public trans\u00ad portation vehicle by handicapped or elderly individuals is removed; (ii) The barrier which is removed had been a barrier for one or more major classes of such individuals (such as the blind, deaf, or wheelchair users) ; and (iii) The removal of that barrier is accomplished without creating any new barrier that significantly impairs ac\u00ad cess to or use of the facility or vehicle by such class or classes. 3. Section 7.190-3 is added to read as set forth below: \u00a7 7.190\u2014 3 Election to deduct architec\u00ad tural and transportation barrier re\u00ad moval expenses. (a) Manner of making election. The election to deduct expenditures for re\u00ad moval of architectural and transporta\u00ad tion barriers provided by section 190(a) shall be made by claiming the deduc\u00ad tion as a separate item identified as such on the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year for which such election is to apply (or, in the case of a partner\u00ad ship, to the return of partnership income for such year). For the election to be valid,, the return must be filed not later than the time prescribed <by law for filing the return (including extensions there\u00ad of) for the taxable year for which the election is to apply. (b) Scope of election. An election under section 190(a) shall apply to all expenditures described in \u00a7 7.190-2 (or, in the case of a taxpayer whose archi\u00ad tectural and transportation barrier re\u00ad moval expenses exceed $25,000 thetaxable year, to the $25,000 of such ex\u00ad penses with respect to which the deduc\u00ad tion is claimed) paid or incurred during the taxable year for which made and shall be irrevocable after the date by which any such election must have been made. (c) Records to be kept. In any case in which an election is made under section 190(a), the taxpayer shall have avail\u00ad able, for the period prescribed by para\u00ad graph (e) of \u00a7 1.6001-1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations), records and documentation, including architectural plans and blueprints, contracts, and any building permits, of all the facts neces\u00ad sary to determine the amount of any de\u00ad duction to which he is entitled by reason of the election, as well as the amount of any adjustment to basis made for ex\u00ad penditures in excess of the amount de\u00ad ductible under section 190. There is a need for immediate guid\u00ad ance with respect to the provisions con\u00ad tained in this Treasury decision. For this reason, it is found impracticable to issue it with notice and public procedure under subsection (b) of section 553 of Title 5 of the United States Code or sub\u00ad ject to the effective date limitation of subsection (d) of that section.

ACTION: Final r\u00e9gulations. SUMMARY : This document provides fi\u00ad nal regulations relating to repayment of interest in the case of certain retroactive elections of FICA coverage by tax- exempt organizations. These regulations clarify the circumstances under which a waiver certificate electing retroactive social security coverage for the employ\u00ad ees of an organization described in sec\u00ad tion 501(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 will be considered filed with the Internal Revenue Service. DATE : The regulations apply in the case of certain waiver certificates elect\u00ad ing retroactive social security coverage that are furnished to the Internal Reve\u00ad nue Service after February 12, 1976. fEDERAl REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17874 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CON\u00ad TACT: William E. Mantle of the Legislation and Regulations Division, Office of the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Serv\u00ad ice, 1111 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20224 (Attention: CC:LR:T) (202-566-3734). SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: Background On February 13, 1976, the Federal Register published proposed amend\u00ad ments to the Employment Tax Regula\u00ad tions (26 CFR Part 31) under section 3121 (k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 41 FR 6776. The amendments were proposed in order to clarify the regula\u00ad tions under section 3121(k) of the Code (relating to the waiver of exemption from social security taxes by religious, charitable, and certain other organiza\u00ad tions). After consideration of all com\u00ad ments regarding the proposed amend\u00ad ments, those amendments are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. This Treasury decision also supersedes Part 33 of the Employment Tax Regula\u00ad tions under 26 U.S.C. 3121 (k) (relating to waiver of exemption by religious, charitable, and certain other organiza\u00ad tions (26 CFR Part 33)). In General The amendment adds a new rule to \u00a7 31.3121 (k)\u2014 1 (c) (4) for determining when a waiver certificate electing retro\u00ad active social security coverage for the employees of an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Code is to be considered filed with the Internal Revenue Service. The amendment ap\u00ad plies in those cases where an organiza\u00ad tion has filed a claim for credit or refund of social security taxes based oh its ex\u00ad emption from paying those taxes. It pro\u00ad vides that the organization must first repay interest it has received in connec\u00ad tion with the claim for credit or refund. However, the interest received by the organization must be repaid only to the extent it relates to taxes for which the organization would be liable by reason of the waiver certificate. In the case of a waiver certificate that has been filed prior to the payment of such a refund to the organization, no credit or refund in respect of the taxes for which the certificate waives the exemption is allowable. Date Certificate Considered Filed The certificate is to be considered filed on the date it was originally fur\u00ad nished to the Internal Revenue Service if the interest has been repaid on or be\u00ad fore the last day of the calendar month following the calendar quarter in which it is furnished. If the repayment occurs after such day, the certificate is to be considered filed on the date the interest 'is actually repaid. Effective Date Due to administrative and equitable considerations, it was decided to modify> RULES AND REGULATIONS the proposed rule to apply only in those cases where the waiver certificate elect\u00ad ing retroactive social security coverage is furnished by the organization to the Internal Revenue Service after Febru\u00ad ary 12, 1976. Drafting Inform ation The principal author of this regulation was William E. Mantle of the Legisla\u00ad tion and Regulations Division, of the Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Reve\u00ad nue Service. However, personnel from other offices of the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department par\u00ad ticipated in developing the regulation, both on matters of substance and style. Adoption of Am endments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR Part 33, Em\u00ad ployment Tax Regulations, Temporary Employment Tax Regulations under 26 U.S.C. 3121(k) (relating to waiver of ex\u00ad emption by religious, charitable, and cer\u00ad tain other organizations), adopted in T.D. 7405, is hereby superseded and re\u00ad served, and 26 CFR Part 31 is amended by adding at the end of paragraph (c) (4) of \u00a7 31.3121 (k )-l the following new sentences : \u00a7 31,3121 (k )\u2014 1 Waiver of exemption from taxes. * * * * * (c) Effect of waiver. * * * (4) Administrative provisions appli\u00ad catile when certificate has retroactive effect. * * * A waiver certificate (as described in section 3121(k)(l) and this section) furnished to the Internal Revenue Service after February 12, 1976, shall not be considered filed with the Internal Revenue Service unless interest paid to the organization (or credited to its account) in connection with a claim for credit or refund of taxes, which claim was based upon the exemption from taxes the organization is waiving by such certificate, is repaid. The in\u00ad terest so paid must be repaid only to the extent such interest relates to any taxes for which the organization or its employees would be liable by reason of the waiver certificate. Furthermore, when a waiver certificate has been filed prior to the payment of a refund of taxes based upon the exemption from taxes the organization in waiving, no credit or refund in respect of the taxes for which the exemption has been waived shall be allowed. If repayment of the interest is made as required by this subpara\u00ad graph, on or before the last day of the calendar month following the calendar quarter in which the certificate is furnished to the Internal Revenue Serv\u00ad ice, such certificate shall be considered to have been filed on the date it was originally furnished. If repayment oc\u00ad curs after that day, such certificate shall be considered to have been filed on the date of the repayment. References in this subparagraph to a waiver certifi\u00ad cate refer also to any supplement to such a certificate. * * * *PART 33\u2014 [RESERVED] (Sec. 7805 of the Internal Revenue ( 68A Stat. 917; 20 U.S.C. 7805).)

Accordingly, 35 CFR Part 7 is amended as follows: FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 1 . By revising paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of \u00a7 7.1 to read as follows: \u00a7 7.1 Definitions. * * * * ' * (d) \"Financial Vice President\" means the Financial Vice President of the Pan\u00ad ama Canal Company acting for and in behalf of that agency or for and in behalf of the Canal Zone Government, as the case may be; (e) \"Chief Accountant\" means Chief Accountant of the Panama Canal Com\u00ad pany acting for and in behalf of that agency or for and in behalf of the Canal Zone Government, as the case may be; (f) \"Chief, Claims Branch,\" means the Chief of the Claims Branch, Accounting Division, of the Panama Canal Company acting for and in behalf of that agency or for and in behalf of the Canal Zone Government, as the case may be. 2. By revising the title and text of \u00a7 7.2 to read as follows: \u00a7 7.2 Applicability and scope. Pursuant to the Act. the Government will settle and pay claims by employees for the loss of or damage to personal property which occurs incident to Gov\u00ad ernment service. Each such claim must be substantiated and the possession of the property must be shown to have been reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances. The maximum amount allowable, on any claim is $15,000. In lieu of a cash settlement, property may be re\u00ad placed in kind at the option of the Gov\u00ad ernment. 3 . By redesignating paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of \u00a7 7.5 as paragraphs (e) , (f) and (g ); by revising the introductory paragraph and paragraph (c) and by in\u00ad serting a new paragraph (d ), the three last-mentioned paragraphs to read as follows: \u00a7 7.5 Principal types of claims payable. The following examples are illustrative of the circumstances or situations out of which compensable claims may arise. Loss or damage due to other causes may also be payable under these regulations. (c) Damage to or loss of property, in\u00ad cluding vehicles, trailers, and property contained therein, which: (1) Is incident to the performance of duty and is sustained as a result of or in connection with civil disturbance, public disorder, efforts to save human life or Government property, or a natural or other disaster; or (2) Occurs in the Canal Zone and re\u00ad sults from vandalism that is determined to have been politically motivated.

The amount allowable for an item of property that is lost or destroyed may not exceed its actual value at the time the loss oc\u00ad curs. Such value may be based upon the replacement cost at the place where claimant resides when award is made, subject to appropriate depreciation to re\u00ad flect the age and condition of the item at the time of loss and to reduction for sal\u00ad vage value, if any. Property is considered \"destroyed\", for purposes of this section, if the cost of repairs would exceed the value of the property immediately prior to the incident out of which the claim arose.

The interim regulations were to expire no later than April 1, 1977. Subsequently, on February 23, 1977, proposed perma\u00ad nent regulations were published in the Federal Register (42 FR 10806) with a deadline for comments on or before March 25,1977. Because of delays in pub\u00ad lishing the proposed regulations, it will not be possible to adequately consider comments received from the public and to adopt permanent regulations prior to the scheduled expiration of the interim regulations. Notice is hereby given that the interim regulations published in the Federal Register (41 FR 48538) on No\u00ad vember 4, 1976, are extended as revised through April 30,1977. Included with the interim regulations published on November 4 was the addi\u00ad tion of paragraph (d) to \u00a7 221.8. This paragraph implemented changes re\u00ad quired by section 14(e) of the National Forest Management Act of 1976. Subse\u00ad quent public comments have identified a need to revise the definition of depend\u00ad ent communities and to make some pro\u00ad cedural changes in order to prevent ad\u00ad verse impacts on the economies of com\u00ad munities dependent upon National For\u00ad est timber. Permanent regulations will be prepared based on public input to the proposed regulations which were pub\u00ad lished on February 23, 1977. However, in order to minimize adverse impacts on local economies and timber supplies im\u00ad mediate implementation of the changes in bidding procedures are required. Since such immediate action is necessary, no\u00ad tice and provision for further public comment at this time on this change in \u00a7221.8 would be impractical and con\u00ad trary to the public interest. Section 221.8 is, therefore, amended by substituting a new paragraph (d), to read as follows:: : , - N v ' FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17876 \u00a7 221.8 Advertisements and bids. * * * * * (d) (1) During the period April 1 through April 30, 1977, sealed bidding will be used for competitive sale of Na\u00ad tional Forest timber, except as provided in paragraphs (d) (2) through (4) of this section. (2) Oral auction bidding may be used in areas where pre-existing agreements required the sale of National Forest tim\u00ad ber by oral auction. (3) (i) In areas tributary to commu\u00ad nities dependent upon National Forest timber, Forest Supervisors may author\u00ad ize the use of a mix of sealed bidding and oral auction bidding methods. When a mix of bidding methods is used, bidding methods on individual sales shall be determined on a random basis designed to provide about 50 percent sealed bid and 50 percent oral auction bid by volume. A record of National For\u00ad est timber sales purchased by firms with primary manufacturing facilities outside the dependent community shall be maintained in areas where a mix of bidding methods is used. If there is a significant increase in the volume of timber purchased by such firms within the tributary area, the Forest Supervisor may increase the proportion of volume sold by oral auction for a period not to exceed one year. (ii) As used herein, a community is an area with common social and eco\u00ad nomic interests, bounded by established daily marketing and workforce commut\u00ad ing patterns, and encompassing one or more primary wood product manufac\u00ad turing facilities. A community is depend\u00ad ent upon National Forest timber when 10 percent or more of the total commu\u00ad nity workforce is employed in the pri\u00ad mary manufacture of wood products, and when National Forest timber has accounted for 30 percent or more of the timber supply for the primary wood product manufacturing facilities in the last 5 years. Tributary are those por\u00ad tions of National Forest System lands from which the dependent communities obtained at least 75 percent of their timber supply in the last 5 years. (iii) If the Regional Forester finds substantial indication of collusive bid\u00ad ding practices in the sale of timber in an area tributary to a dependent commu\u00ad nity, he may direct that sealed bidding be used in all future sales. (4) Oral auction bidding may be used where there is urgent need to salvage insect-infested or damaged timber in or\u00ad der to prevent the spread of insects or product deterioration.

The State requested that the modi\u00ad fied Section V be incorporated as a revi\u00ad sion of the federally approved Delaware SIP. The amendments consist of a revised Section V\u2014Surveillance as it applies to both the State of Delaware SIP and the New Castle County portion of the SIP for attainment and maintenance of standards for particulate matter and sul\u00ad fur dioxide. These changes to Section V consist of the following: 1. General narrative \u2014The modifica\u00ad tions listed below are made: a. Changes are included to eliminate the requirement to monitor nitrogen dioxide. Monitoring of this pollutant is no longer required in the New Castle County portion of the Metropolitan Philadelphia Interstate Air Quality Con\u00ad trol Region (AQCR), because this county has been redesignated Priority III (38 FR 16346). The State has indicated that nitrogen oxides are still being monitored at sites P-1 and P-2, to provide an on\u00ad going assessment of its concentration level. The narrative also specifies that carbon monoxide and photochemical oxidants are being monitored at sites P-1 and P-2. b. Changes are included to reflect availability of manually processed data for hourly periods only, rather than for both 15-minute and one-hour periods. 2. Tables and figures \u2014The following modifications listed below are made: Table V -l\u2014The Jacobs-Hochheiser Meth\u00ad od for nitrogen dioxide, as well as footnotes c and d, has been deleted. Table V-2\u2014This table replaces former Table V\u2014 3; former Table V-2 is deleted. Table V-3\u2014Former Tables V-4 and V-5 are combined and restructured so that the sampling frequency parameter is a function of the air pollutant. Table V-4\u2014'Former Tables V-6 and V-7 are combined. Changes made as of January 1 , 1973 are reflected. Table V-5\u2014This table replaces former Table V-9, and is restructured in format similar to Table V-3. Figures V -l and V-2 are amended to indi\u00ad cate changes in the location of monitoring sites.3. Changes to monitoring systems\u2014 a. Deletion of Narrative. The narrative describing previously proposed additions to the State's monitoring network is deleted. b. Primary System, i. The types of data listed below are still being gener\u00ad ated, but either by using different refer\u00ad ence methods or by monitoring only at specific sites: (a) Carbon monoxide \u2014The existing monitoring technique applies, but this information is being generated only at monitoring sites P-1 and P-2. (b) Photochemical Oxidants \u2014The ex\u00ad isting monitoring technique applies, but this information is being generated only at monitoring sites P-1 and P-2. (c) Nitrogen Oxides \u2014Information is being generated only at monitoring sites P-1 and P-2. (d) Soiling Index \u2014Coefficient of Haze Units replaces reference units and are being monitored at site P-2 only. ii. Data Reduction\u2014The 15-minute and 6-hour averages are deleted; one- hour averages are now being reduced manually, and running 24-hour and annual averages are now being generated through computer processing. iii. Changes in monitoring site\u2014Site P-2 is relocated in downtown Wilming\u00ad ton and site P-1 is now located at the Woods Haven-Kruse School in Clay- mont. c. Secondary System, i. The following types of data are still being generated but are either using different reference methods or are being monitored only at specific sites: (a) Soiling Index \u2014The Coefficient of Haze Units (continuous, stand-by basis) is replacing the A.I.S.I. Tape Sampler. (b) Sulfur Dioxide \u2014The conductivity method (y2 horn- averages) is being re\u00ad placed with the West-Gaeke method (continuous) at all New Castle County Stations. In addition, the bubbler method is being used at monitoring sites S-ll and S-12. ii. The following monitoring sites are added: City Water Tower, Seaford S-13, Danneker School, Milford (stand-by basis) iii. The following monitoring sites are changed in status to stand-by basis: S-4, Lombardy School, Faulk Road S-6, Ferris School, Centre Road S-7, Delaware SPCA, Greater Wilmington Airport S-10, County Route 413, East of Mt.

P-2, Downtown Wilmington (relocated) All four primary stations and the re\u00ad maining secondary stations located throughout the State will continue full operation. The State has determined that the lack of resources prevents adequate data handling and analysis, and that reallocation of the available resources to the remaining stations would improve the overall efficiency of the network. The State has also indicated that once a fully automatic telemetry network is installed in the four primary stations and if addi\u00ad tional resources become available' the standby stations will resume operations. On June 9, 1976 (41 FR 23203), the Administrator acknowledged receipt of the amendments submitted by the State, proposed the amendments as a revision of the Delaware State Implementation Plan and provided for a 30 day public comment period, ending July 9, 1976. During the public comment period, no comments were received. The revised system meets population and emergency episode requirements as well as collection reporting techniques as specified by the Administrator in 40 CFR 51.17. However, two of the relocated monitoring sites, P -l and P-2, do not presently meet the requirements for lo\u00ad cating monitors in areas of maximum concentrations as specified in 40 CFR 51.17(a)(2). Site P -l, which is photochemical oxidants cally ozone) is located too close to Route 1-95. Site P-2, which is designed to meas\u00ad ure maximum concentration of carbon monoxide (C O ), is not located in a maxi\u00ad mum downtown street canyon site. In addition, Region I l l 's evaluation of the monitoring instrumentation portion of this plan revision indicates that the in\u00ad strument that the State plans to use to measure sulfur dioxide is antiquated and outmoded. The State of Delaware has made commitments to relocate monitor\u00ad ing sites P -l and P-2 during fiscal year (FY) 1977, and to negotiate a mutually acceptable compliance schedule for re\u00ad placement of the outmoded instrumenta\u00ad tion. Therefore, with the exception of the location of monitoring sites P -l and P-2, and the type of instrumentation cur\u00ad rently being used to measure sulfur diox\u00ad ide, the Administrator approves changes to Part V of both the Delaware State Im\u00ad plementation Plan and the New Castle County portion of the Delaware State Implementation Plan as a revision to the federally approved Delaware State Im \u00ad plementation Plan effective May 4, 1977. However, in view of the commitment to relocate the P -l and P-2 monitoring sites to acceptable locations and to update the monitoring instrumentation, the Admin\u00ad istrator conditionally approves the pres\u00ad ent location of these two monitoring sites as well as the continued use of the cur\u00ad rent sulfur dioxide monitoring instru\u00ad ments. Similarly, the Administrator hereby amends 40 CFR 52.20 to incorporate this revision into the Delaware SIP.Copies of the amendments to the moni\u00ad toring network for the State of Delaware are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Re\u00ad gion in, Curtis Building, Tenth Floor, Sixth and Walnut Streets, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19106.

L. 94-455, the Tax Reform Act of 1976. w Section 401 of Pub. L. 94-12, the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, provided for a Federal Welfare Recipient Employment Incentive Tax Credit to employers who hire AFDC recipients. This tax credit, originally effective 'through June 30, 1976, has'been extended to December 31, 1979, under section 2107(d) of Pub. L. 94- 455, enacted October 4, 1976. Regulations in \u00a7 235.40 required wel\u00ad fare agencies to certify whether the in\u00ad dividuals employed were in fact eligible for, and recipients of, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). How\u00adever, the requirement was effective only through June 30,1976, and therefore was dropped from the CFR- The basic purpose of the amendments is to conform the Department's regula\u00ad tions with the statutory changes by ex\u00ad tending the certification requirement through December 31, 1979. Experience under current regulation has indicated the need for clarification as to appropriate procedures and the confidentiality requirements. For in\u00ad stance, some employers have made their requests by phone. One large corpora\u00ad tion wrote asking that a complete list of AFDC recipients be provided to them as a basis for determining which of their employees belong in the group for which the tax credit is available. Accordingly, language has been added to make clear that: 1. The request for certification, and the certification itself, are to be in writing. (The State agency needs a record of the request and its purpose in order to com\u00ad ply with confidentiality requirements. The employer needs a written certifica\u00ad tion to submit in claiming the tax credit); and 2. The confidentiality provisions of 45 CFR 205.50 require that the information be released and used only for the stated purpose of claiming the tax credit (\u00a7 205.50(a) (1) (i) (c) specifically refers to certification of receipt of AFDC for such purpose.) Section 2107(f) of Pub. L. 94-455 also prpvides that either the Department of Labor or the State or local welfare agency may certify to employers that individuals hired were, in fact, AFDC recipients. Policies to implement this provision will be issued jointly by the Department of Labor and HEW. The Department finds good cause to dispense with proposed rulemaking procedures for two reasons. The law is specific and provides no alternative but to extend the effective date. The tax year has ended and those who have employed welfare recipients (and should be en\u00ad couraged to continqe to do so) will need the certifications in order to claim the tax credit. Accordingly, \u00a7 235.40, Part 235, Chap\u00ad ter II, Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations is restored, with its extended certification date, to read as set forth below: \u00a7 235.40 Certification of AFDC re\u00ad cipients for employment incentive tax credit.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service [7 CFR Part 908] HANDLING OF VALENCIA ORANGES GROWN IN ARIZONA AND DESIGNATED PART OF CALIFORNIA Minimum Size Requirements AGENCY : Agricultural Marketing Serv\u00ad ice, USDA. ACTION: Proposed Rule. SUMMARY: This proposal would require fresh Valencia oranges shipped from District 2 of the California-Arizona pro\u00ad duction area to measure at least 2.32 inches in diameter during the period April 22. 1977, through January 15, 1978. The proposal was submitted by the Va\u00ad lencia Orange Administrative Committee established under the order to adminis\u00ad ter the program locally. The committee reports that the composition of the crop is such that more than ample quantities of larger, more desirable sizes of oranges are available to meet fresh market de\u00ad mand, and it would be in the interest of producers and consumers to limit ship\u00ad ments to the sizes specified. The smaller sizes of oranges could be disposed of in export and in processing outlets. DATE: Comments must be received on or before April 15,1977. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CON\u00ad TACT: Charles R. Brader, Deputy Director, Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricul\u00ad tural Marketing Service, U.S. Depart\u00ad ment of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20250. (202-447-3545). Notice is hereby given that the Depart\u00ad ment is considering the establishment of a size regulation for Valencia oranges grown in District 2, pursuant to the ap\u00ad plicable provisions of the amended mar\u00ad keting agreement and order No. 908, as amended (7 CFR Part 908), regulating the handling of Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated part of Cali\u00ad fornia. This regulatory program is ef\u00ad fective under the Agricultural Market\u00ad ing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.s.c. 601-674). The proposed amend\u00ad ment was recommended by the Valencia Orange Administrative Committee, es\u00ad tablished under the amended marketing agreement and v order as the agency to administer its terms and provisions. The 1976-77 season crop of Valencia oranges is currently estimated by the committee at 55,500 cars. The committee reports that demand in regulated fresh market channels is expected to require about 38 percent of this volume. The re\u00ad maining 62 percent would be available for utilization in export and processing out\u00adlets. The committee indicates that vol\u00ad ume and size composition of the crop of Valencia oranges grown in District 2 are such that ample supplies of the more desirable sizes will be available to satisfy the demand in regulated channels. The regulation is designed to permit ship\u00ad ments of ample supplies of fruit of the more desirable sizes in the interest of growers and consumers. All persons who desire to submit writ\u00ad ten comment for consideration in con\u00ad nection with the proposed regulation shall file two copies with the Hearing Clerk, United States Department of Ag\u00ad riculture, Room 1077, South Building, Washington, D.C. 20250, not later than April 15, 1977. All written submissions will be made available for public inspec\u00ad tion at the office of the Hearing Clerk during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)). Order, (a) During the period April 22, 1977, through January 15, 1978, no han\u00ad dler shall handle any Valencia oranges grown in District 2 which are of a size smaller than 2.32 inches in diameter, which shall be the largest measurement at a right angle to a straight line run\u00ad ning from the stem to the blossom end of the fruit: Provided, That not to exceed 5 percent, by count, of the Valencia oranges contained in any type of con\u00ad tainer may measure smaller than 2.32 inches in diameter. (b) As used in this section, \"handle\", \"handler\" , and \"District 2\" shall have the same meaning as when used in said amended marketing agreement and order. Dated: March 29,1977 Charles R.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments were received by letter dated November 15, 1976, from the Air Trans\u00ad port Association and by letter dated De\u00ad cember 1, 1976, from the Boeing Com\u00ad pany. The Boeing Company stated that a program had already been started with its vendor, HydroAire, and that they had modified 13 of the P/N 42-307-1 Mark III autobrake/antiskid control boxes out of a total of 23. Recently we received veri\u00ad fication that all 23 of the affected control boxes have been modified. Boeing also provided us with new technical data which demonstrates that this fault does not exist on the basic P/N 42-307 Mark III antiskid control boxes as originally believed. Withdrawal of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making constitutes only such ac\u00ad tion, and does not preclude the FAA from issuing another Notice or commit the FAA to any other course of action in the future. In consideration of the foregoing, and pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator (31 FR 13697), the proposed airworthiness directive published in the Federal Register on Thursday, September 30, 1976, Vol. 41, No. 191, (31 FR 43181) is hereby with\u00ad drawn.

Box 92007 Worldway Postal Center, Los Angeles, California 90009. Telephone 213-536- SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION-. AD 76-20-08 requires repetitive visual in\u00ad spections of the main landing gear upper side brace trunnion joint areas with re\u00ad placement or repair of damaged parts, as necessary, on Lockheed-California Com\u00ad pany Model L-1011-385 series airplanes. Amendment 39-2742 was issued as a re\u00ad sult of several cases where one of the two main landing gear upper side brace spherical bearing trunnion retaining bolts failed due to stress corrosion on Lockheed-California Company L-1011- 385 series airplanes. A single bolt failure will not usually result in secondary struc\u00ad tural failures leading to unsafe condi\u00ad tions, however, continued operation with one failed bolt combined with severe landing or ground maneuver conditions, could lead to a collapse of a main landing gear assembly. The required repetitive visual checks provides an interim safety precaution until the compliance with \u00a7 25.573(b) of the Federal Aviation Reg\u00ad ulations is established. After issuing Amendment 39-2742, the manufacturer modified the type design of the upper side brace trunnion joint components to eliminate the potential stress corrosion condition of the upper side brace spheri\u00ad cal bearing trunnion retaining bolts. These modifications are described in FAA Approved Lockheed-California Company Service Bulletins 093-32-115 and 093-32- 120. Therefore, the FAA is considering amending Amendment 39-2742 to require modification of the upper side brace spherical bearing trunnion joints in ac\u00ad cordance with the manufacturer's Serv\u00ad ice Bulletins, and thereby secure compliance with FAR 25.573(b). Interested persons are invited to par\u00ad ticipate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data,PROPOSED RULES views, or arguments as they may desire. * Information on the economic, environ\u00ad mental, and energy impact that might result because of adoption of the pro\u00ad posed rule is requested.

AD 76-24-01, Amendment 39-2775 (41 PR 52047), appeared in the Federal Register on November 26,1976, and be\u00ad came effective December 27, 1976. The present AD was issued to require removal of eighth stage compressor disk, P/N 496908, due to fatigue cracking of the disk which resulted in uncontained failure of the disk. The proposed NPRM would modify the compliance time in the present AD by requiring eighth stage disk removal by June 30, 1977, for those disks above 8,000 cycles, in lieu of the present requirement to remove disks by December 31,1977, for those disks above 6.000 cycles. In addition, the proposed NPRM would create another compliance category which allows disks between 6.000 and 8,000 cycles to continue in service until September 30, 1977, after which they must be removed. The pro\u00ad posed NPRM also establishes a new re\u00ad tirement life of 6,000 cycles for P/N 496908 compressor disks after Septem\u00ad ber 30,1977. After the issuance of AD 76-24-01, a U.S. certificated air carrier experienced a severe eighth stage compressor disk failure while climbing through 14,000 feet. The disk sustained a 360\u00b0 rim separation which exited through a 12 inch by 20 inch hole in the engine case, resulting in separation of the engine starter, start bleed valve, and portions of the upper and lower cowling. A re\u00ad view of the preceding failure history in\u00ad dicated six similar uncontinued disk failures, two of which resulted in fires and five of which caused secondary air\u00ad craft damage. Based on the degree of serious secondary aircraft damage sus\u00ad tained during these failures, the FAA has determined that the eighth stage compressor disk failure mode does have potentially hazardous effects due to the release of high energy projectiles. The nginal AD compliance was based upon w ii\\ energy type failure- Therefore, the i\u00ab* determined it necessary, in the interest of safety, to revise the com- Phance time of AD 76-24-01 to require rlier removal of eighth stage com\u00ad pressor disks.This NPRM will affect U.S. domestic carriers and foreign carriers by requir\u00ad ing, in some instances, premature engine removals, aircraft on the ground, and increased maintenance effort to meet the proposed removal schedule. The cost for compliance is estimated as 47 million dollars. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend \u00a7 39.13 of Part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13), Amendment 39-2775 (41 FR 52047), AD 76-24-01 as follows: 1. By deleting the words in Paragraph 1 beginning with \"prior to reaching\" and ending with \"not to be exceeded.\" 2. By inserting in Paragraph 1 after \"P/N 496908,\" the words \"in accordance with the following schedule:.\" 3. By adding the following new para\u00ad graphs: A. By June 30, 1977, disks with over 8,000 cycles since new. The original es\u00ad tablished life of 11,000 cycles shall not be exceeded. B. By September 30, 1977, disks with over 6,000 cycles, but less than 8,000 cycles since new. After September 30, 1977, disks shall not exceed 6,000 cycles.

These proposed amendments up\u00ad date the self-employment provisions of the regulations which apply to certain ministers, members of religious orders, Christian Science Practioners, retired business partners, public officers and em\u00ad ployees paid on a fee basis, and citizens engaging in business outside the United States. These provisions are based upon public laws which have already beenfully implemented by the Social Security Administration. The proposed amendments reflect changes made by sections 115, 118 and 122 of Pub. L. 90-248 enacted January 2, 1968, section 203 of Pub. L. 92-336 en\u00ad acted July 1, 1972, sections 121, 124, and 140 of Pub. L. 92-603 enacted October 30, 1972, section 203 of Pub. L. 93-66 enacted July 9,1973, and section 5 of Pub. L. 93- 233 enacted December 31 1973. Coverage of ministerial services of clergymen. Section 115 of Pub. L. 90-248 provides that the services a clergyman, Christian Science practitioner, or mem\u00ad ber of a religious order (except a member who has taken a vow of poverty) per\u00ad forms in the exercise of his profession are covered under social security under the provisions applicable to the self-em\u00ad ployed unless, within certain time limits, he files an irrevocable application for ex\u00ad emption, effective for taxable years end\u00ad ing after 1967. Prior to the 1967 amendments the services which a clergyman, Christian Science practitioner, or member of a re\u00ad ligious order who had not taken a vow of poverty performed in the exercise of his respective calling were excluded from social security coverage unless he elected coverage. To elect coverage, the individ\u00ad ual was required by law to file a waiver certificate within a prescribed time. Serv\u00ad ices which a member of a religious order who had taken a vow of poverty per\u00ad formed were compulsorly excluded from coverage. An individual clergyman has been able to decide on a completely voluntary ba\u00ad sis whether he would be covered under social security. From time to time clergymen who did not file the waiver certificate within the prescribed time, later have wished to be\u00ad come covered. On several occasions in the past, the time has been extended in which clergymen could elect coverage. The Act, as amended, now changes the coverage provisions for clergymen. All clergymen are automatically covered un\u00ad der social security, except those who are opposed for reasons of r\u00e9ligious princi\u00ad ples or conscience to the acceptance of public insurance, including social secu\u00ad rity benefits, based on their services as clergymen. Clergymen who are so op\u00ad posed can have their ministerial services excluded from coverage by filing with the Internal Revenue Service a statement to that effect, together with an application for exemption. When the application is approved, it is irrevocable. Members of religious orders who have taken a vow of poverty continue to be excluded from social security coverage. Retirement payments made to retired partners. Section 118 of Pub. L. 90-248 provides that certain payments on ac\u00ad count of retirement made by a partner\u00ad ship to a retired partner are excluded in the computation of his net earnings from self-employment, effective for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1967. Before the 1967 amendments, the retirement payments made by a partner\u00ad ship to a retired partner from the cur- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17882 PROPOSED RULES rent earnings of the partnership were generally treated as earnings from self- employment and were covered under so\u00ad cial security. This was true even though the retired partner had no relationship (other than receiving retirement pay\u00ad ments) with, and performed no services for, the partnership. The law now pro\u00ad vides, effective with taxable years ending on or after December 31,1967, that these payments may be excluded not only for retirement test purposes but also for so\u00ad cial security contributions and benefit computations. The payments are excluded under con\u00ad ditions which assure that they are bona fide retirement income. The basic re\u00ad quirements that must be met are: 1. The retirement payments must be made pursuant to a written plan of the partnership, and. 2. The written plan must apply to partners generally or to a class or classes of partners, and 3. The written plan provides periodic payments until the retired partner's death, and 4. The retired partner renders no serv\u00ad ice for the partnership during the part\u00ad nership taxable year ending with or within his taxable year, and 5. At the end of the partnership's tax\u00ad able year, the only obligation from the other partners to the retired partner is to make retirement payments and the retired partner's share in the partnership capital has been paid to him in full. The requirements for the retirement plan of a partnership are the require\u00ad ments prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury's delegate, as required by sec\u00ad tion 211(a) (9) of the Social Security Act. Employees in positions compensated solely on a fee basis. Section 122 of Pub. L. 90-248 provides that fees received af\u00ad ter 1967 by State and local public officials and employees in positions compensated solely on a fee basis and not covered by social security under an agreement be\u00ad tween the State and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare are cov\u00ad ered under social security under the pro\u00ad visions applicable to the self-employed. This provision applies mainly to State and local government employees who are compensated solely on a fee basis. Pees received after 1967 by employees who are compensated solely on a fee basis in po\u00ad sitions which are not covered under a State agreement are covered under the self-employment provisions of the law, except that employees in these positions in 1968 could have elected not to have their fees covered under the self-em\u00ad ployment provisions by filing a state\u00ad ment, requesting the exclusions, with the Internal Revenue Service on or be\u00ad fore the due date of the tax return for 1968. Prior to this provision, the States were permitted to cover or exclude from cov\u00ad erage fee-basis employees at the time a State extended coverage to a coverage group. The State could extend coverage to fee-basis employees at a later date, if they were excluded at the time coverage was extended to a coverage group, but if they were once brought under coverage,they could not later be excluded. Under section 122 of Pub. L. 90-248, a State may be permitted to cover or exclude from coverage, employees who are compen\u00ad sated solely by fees by modifying its agreement after 1967. States have not provided coverage for most fee-basis em\u00ad ployees, partly because fees are generally paid directly to the employee by the pub\u00ad lic and the employer would have difficul\u00ad ties in withholding the social security tax and in making accurate reports on the amount of fees received. . Maximum amount of self-employment earnings creditable. Section 203 of Pub. L. 92-336, section 203 of Pub. L. 93-66, and section 5 of Pub. L. 93-233 relate to the maximum amount of earnings credit\u00ad able for social security purposes. The So\u00ad cial Security Act now provides for automatic increases in benefits' and in the level of earnings subject to the social security tax. The automatic increases, which apply to both wages and self-em\u00ad ployment income, are intended to keep the social security program up to date with changes in the economy. Whenever social security cash benefits are raised because of increases in the cost of living, the law requires a review of wages cov\u00ad ered by social security. If average wages have gone up, the earnings base must be raised too. Under this provision; the social se\u00ad curity earnings base was automatically increased for 1977 to reflect increases in average earnings covered by social se\u00ad curity. The new base is $16,500, compared to $15,300 for 1976. The self-employment income provisions in the regulations are being updated to reflect the 1977 increase in addition to other increases over the past several years. Optional method of reporting self-em\u00ad ployment income from nonfarm business. Section 121 of Pub. L. 92-603 provides an optional method of determining net earnings from nonfarm self-employment, effective for taxable years beginning after 1972. Under the amendments, nonfarm self- employed people have the option of re\u00ad porting as their net earnings for social security purposes two-thirds of their gross income from nonfarm self-em\u00ad ployment but not more than $1,600. This option is comparable to the option which has been available to farm operators for some time. The provision includes a regularity of coverage requirement, and can be used only five times by any individual. The intent of the option is to enable regularly self-employed operators of nonfarm business to maintain continu\u00ad ity of social security coverage in years when they have small net earnings or suffer net losses. The law contains the condition that, in order to use the op\u00ad tional method of reporting, a person must have had actual net earnings from self-employment of at least $400 in 2 of the 3 consecutive prior years. The op\u00ad tional method allows these people to receive higher social security credit than would be possible based on their actual net earnings.U.S. citizens self-employed outside- the U.S. who retain residence in the United States. Section 124 of Pub. L. 92- 603 provides that a U.S. citizen self- employed outside the United States who retains his residence in the United States throughout the entire taxable year shall compute his net earnings from self- employment without regard to the In\u00ad ternal Revenue Code \"earned-income- abroad\" exclusions, effective for taxable years beginning after 1972. The 1972 amendments provided that a U.S. citizen self-employed outside the United States who retains residence in the United States throughout the entire taxable year will compute his net earn\u00ad ings from self-employment for social security purposes on the same basis as a person self-employed in the United States. Under the Internal Revenue Code, the first $20,000 of self-employ\u00ad ment income earned outside the United States by a citizen who was present in a foreign country at least 510 days out of an 18-consecutive month period was, under certain circumstances, excluded in computing gross income for income tax purposes. (This amount was reduced to $15,000, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, by Pub. L. 94-455, enacted October 4,1976.) While identical exclusions in the So\u00ad cial Security Act and the Internal Rev\u00ad enue Code have permitted consistent ad\u00ad ministration and rules for taxpayers, the exclusions have had serious adverse effects on the social security protection of many workers and their families. For example, many free-lance newspaper\u00ad men, news photographers and commen\u00ad tators, and clergymen did not have any covered earnings from self-employment outside the U.S. because they did not earn more than the excluded amount. U.S. ministers and members of reli\u00ad gious orders who maintain residence in a foreign country. Section 140 of Pub. L. 92-603 provides that an American min\u00ad ister or member of a religious order serving outside the United States shall compute his net earnings from self- employment without regard to the \"eamed-income-abroad\" exclusions, ef\u00ad fective for taxable years beginning after 1972. The $20,000 exclusion ($15,000 for taxable years beginning after Decem\u00ad ber 31, 1975) does not apply in taxable years beginning after 1972 to U.S. citi\u00ad zen clergymen and members of religious orders serving abroad who are residents of a foreign country. Thus, coverage is extended to such individuals who were previously excluded because they neither worked for an American employer nor served congregations composed pre\u00ad dominantly of U.S. citizens. These in\u00ad security purposes in the same way as clergymen in the United States. If there are any questions concerning this regulation, you may contact Wil\u00ad liam J.

Dated: February 28,1977. J. B. Cardw ell , Commissioner of Social Security. Approved: March 28,1977. Joseph A. Ca l if a n o , Jr., Secretary of HealthEducation, and Welfare. Part 404 of Chapter 331 of Title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: 1 . Section 404.1051 is amended by re\u00ad vising paragraph (a) to read as follows: \u00a7 404.1051 General rule for computa\u00ad tion of net earnings from self- employment. (a) Determining net earnings. In gen\u00ad eral, the gross income and deductions of an individual attributable to a trade or business, (including a trade or business conducted by an employee referred to in \u00a7404.1070 (c)(2), (c)(3 ), (c)(4 ), and (e)) for the purpose of ascertaining his net earnings from self-employment, are to be determined by reference to the pro\u00ad visions of law and regulations applicable with respect to the taxes imposed by sec\u00ad tions 1 and 3 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Thus, if an individual uses the accrual method of accounting in computing taxable income from a trade or business for the purpose of the tax imposed by such sections, he must use the same method in determining net earnings from self-employment. Like\u00ad wise, if a taxpayer engaged in a trade or business of selling property on the in\u00ad stallment plan elects, under the provi\u00ad sions of section 453 of the Internal Reve\u00ad nue Code of 1954, to use the installment method in computing income for pur\u00adposes of the tax under section 1 or 3 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, he must use the same method in determin\u00ad ing net earnings from self-employment. Income which is excludable from gross income under any provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 is not taken into account in determining net earnings from self-employment ex\u00ad cept as otherwise provided in \u00a7 404.1059, relating to certain residents of Puerto Rico, in \u00a7 404.1061, relating to ministers or members of religious orders, in \u00a7 404.1061a, relating to United States citizens temporarily living outside the United States, and in \u00a7 404.1063, re\u00ad lating to the term \"possession of the United States.\" Thus, in the case of a citizen of the United States who resides outside the United States and is con\u00ad ducting, in a foreign country, a trade or business in which both personal services and capital are material income-produc\u00ad ing factors, any part of the income there\u00ad from which is excluded from gross in\u00ad come as earned income under the pro\u00ad visions of section 911 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the regulations thereunder is not taken into account in determining net earnings from self- employment. * ' * * * 2. Section 404.1058a is added to read as follows: \u00a7 404.1058a Retirement payment to re\u00ad tired partners. (a) In general. In computing his net earnings from self-employment for tax\u00ad able years ending on or after December 31, 1967, a retired partner shall exclude payments made to him on a periodic basis by a partnership on account of his re\u00ad tirement and pursuant to a written plan of the partnership. This exclusion applies only if the requirements prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section: and, in addition, the conditions set forth in para\u00ad graph (c) of this section are met. (b) Retirement plan of partnership. (1) The written plan of the partnership must set forth the terms and conditions of the program or system established by the partnership for making payments to retired partners on account of their re\u00ad tirement. To qualify as payments on ac\u00ad count of retirement, the payments must constitute bona fide retirement income. Thus, payments of benefits not custom\u00ad arily included in a pension or retirement plan such as layoff benefits are not pay\u00ad ments on account of retirement. Eligibil\u00ad ity for retirement generally is established on the basis of age, physical condition, or a combination of age or physical condi\u00ad tion and years of service. Generally, re\u00ad tirement benefits are measured by, and based on, such factors as years of service and compensation received. In determin\u00ab ing whether the plan of the partnership provides for payments on account of re\u00ad tirement, criteria such as factors, for\u00ad mulas, etc., reflected in public, and in broad based private, pension or retire\u00ad ment plans in prescribing eligibility re\u00ad quirements and in computing benefits may be taken into account. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL(2) Hie plan of the partnership must provide for payments On account of retirement\u2014 (i) To partners generally or to a class or classes of partners, (ii) On a periodic basis, and (iii) Which continue at least until the partner's death. A class of partners may, in an appropriate case, contain only one member. Payments are made on a periodic basis if made at regularly re\u00ad curring intervals (usually monthly) not exceeding one year. (c) . Other conditions relating to ex\u00ad clusion.' (1) In general. A payment made to a retired partner pursuant to a writ\u00ad ten plan of a partnership which meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall be excluded, in com\u00ad puting net earnings from self-employ\u00ad ment, only if ----- (1) The retired partner rendered no service with respect to any trade or business carried on by the partnership (or its successors) during the taxable year of the partnership (or its suc\u00ad cessors), which ended within or with the taxable year of the retired partner in which the payment was received by him; (ii) No obligation (whether certain in amount or contingent on a subsequent event) exists (as of the close of the partnership's taxable year referred to in paragraph (c) (1) (i) of this section) from the other partners to the retired partner except with respect to retire\u00ad ment payments under the plan; and (iii) The retired partner's share (if any) of the capital of the partnership has been paid to him in full before the close of the partnership's taxable year referred to in paragraph (c)(1 ) (i) of this section. (2) Under paragraph (c) (!) of this section, either all payments on account of retirement received by a retired partner during the taxable year of the partnership ending within or with his taxable year are excluded or none of the payments are excluded. Paragraph (c)(1 ) (ii) of this section applies only to obligations from other partners, in their capacity as partners, as distin\u00ad guished from an obligation which arises and exists from a transaction unrelated to the partnership or to a trade or busi\u00ad ness carried on by the partnership. In effect, paragraph (c)(1 ) of this section provides that the exclusion may apply to payments received by a retired partner during the partnership's taxabl\u00e9 year ending within or with his taxable year only if, at the close of the partner\u00ad ship's taxable year, the retired partner had no financial interest in the partner\u00ad ship except for the right to retirement payments. (d) Examples. The application of paragraph (c)(1 ) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. Each example assumes that the partner\u00ad ship plan pursuant to which the pay\u00ad ments are made meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Example 1. A, who files his income tax re\u00ad turns on a calendar year basis, is a partner in the ABC partnership. The partnership's 4, 1977 \\ 17884 taxable year is the period July 1 to June 30, inclusive. A retired from the partnership on January 1, 1973, and receives monthly pay\u00ad ments on account of his retirement. As of June 30, 1973, no obligation existed from the other partners to A (except with respect to retirement payments under the plan) and A's share of the capital of the partnership had been paid to him in full. The monthly retirement payments received by A from the partnership in his taxable year ending on December 31, 1973, are not excluded from net earnings from self-employment since A rendered service to th\u00e9 partnership during a portion of the partnership's taxable year (July 1, 1972, through June 30, 1973) which ended within A's taxable year\u2014January 1 to December 31, 1973. Example 2. D, a partner in the DEF part\u00ad nership, retired from the partnership as of December 31, 1972. The taxable year of both D and the partnership is the calendar year. During the partnership's taxable year ending December 31, 1973, D rendered no service with respect to any trade or business carried on by the partnership. On or before Decem\u00ad ber 31, 1973, all obligations (other than with respect to retirement payments under the plan) from the other partners to D were liquidated, and D's share of the capital of the partnership was paid to him. Retirement payments received by D pursuant to the partnership's plan in his taxable year end\u00ad ing December 31, 1973, are excluded in de\u00ad termining his net earnings from self-em\u00ad ployment (if any) for that taxable year. Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 2 except that as of the close of De\u00ad cember 31, 1973, D had a right to a fixed percentage of any amounts collected by the partnership after that date attributable to services rendered by him prior to his retire\u00ad ment for clients of the partnership. The monthly payments received by D in his tax\u00ad able year ending December 31, 1973, are not excluded from net earnings from self-em\u00ad ployment since as of the close of the partner\u00ad ship's taxable year which ended with D's taxable year, an obligation (other than an obligation with respect to retirement pay\u00ad ments) existed from'the other partners to D. 3. Section 404.1061 is amended by re\u00ad vising paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) to read as follows: \u00a7 404.1061 Ministers and members of religious orders (computations of net earnings). (a) In general. For each taxable year ending after 1954 in which a minister or a member of a religious order is engaged in a trade or business, within the mean\u00ad ing of section 211(c) of the Act (see 5 404.1070(e)), net earnings from self- employment from such trade or business include the gross income derived during the taxable year from any such trade or business, less the deductions attributable to such gross income. For each taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1957, such minister or member of a re\u00ad ligious order shall compute his net earn\u00ad ings from self-employment derived from the performance of such service without regard to the exclusions from gross in\u00ad come provided by section 107 of the In\u00ad ternal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to rental value of parsonages) and section 119 of such code (relating to meals and lodging furnished for the convenience of the employer). Thus, a minister, en\u00ad gaged in a trade or business within the meaning of section 211(c) of the Act will include in the computation of his netPROPOSED RULES earnings from self-employment for a taxable year ending on or after Decem\u00ad ber 31, 1957, the rental value of a home furnished to him as remuneration for services performed in the exercise of his ministry or the rental allowance paid to him as remuneration for such services irrespective of whether such rental value or rental allowance is excluded from gross income by section 107 of the Inter\u00ad nal Revenue Code of 1954. Similarly, the value of any meals or lodging furnished to a minister or to a member of a re\u00ad ligious order in connection with services performed in the exercise of his minis\u00ad try or as a member of such order will be included in the computation of his net earnings fom self-employment for a tax\u00ad able year ending on or after December 31, 1957, notwithstanding the exclusion of such value from gross income by sec\u00ad tion 119 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. (b) Taxable years beginning after 1972. For taxable years beginning after 1972, if a minister or member of a re\u00ad ligious order engaged in a trade or busi\u00ad ness within the meaning of section 211 .(c) of the Act (see 5 404.1070(e)) and was a citzien of the United States per\u00ad forming services outside the United States in his capacity as a minister or member of a religious order, his net earnings from self-employment derived from the performance of such service shall be computed as provided in para\u00ad graph (a) of this section but without regard to the exclusions from gross in\u00ad come provided in section 911 of the In\u00ad ternal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to earned income from sources without the United States, and section 931 of the In\u00ad ternal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to income from sources within possessions of the United States. Thus, even though all the income of the minister or mem\u00ad ber, for service of the character to which this paragraph is applicable, was derived from sources outside the United States, or from sources within possessions of the United States and, therefore, may for in\u00ad come tax purposes be excluded from gross income, such income is included in computing net earnings from self-em\u00ad ployment. The provisions of this para\u00ad graph do not apply to a minister or a member of a religious order who has been granted an exemption from the payment of the tax on self-employment income under 55 404.1086-404.1089. (c) Taxable years beginning before 1973. (1) In the employ of an American employer. For taxable years beginning before 1973, if a minister or member of a religious order engaged in a trade or business within the meaning of section 211(c) of the Act (see 55 404.1070(e) and 404.1080) was a citizen of the United States and performed service, in his ca\u00ad pacity as a minister or member of a religious order, as an employee of an American employer, as defined in 5 404.- 1003(c)(3), his net earnings from self- employment derived from such service shall be computed as provided in para\u00ad graph (a) of this section but without re\u00ad gard to the exclusions from gross income provided in section 911 of the InternalRevenue Code of 1954, relating to earned income from sources without the United States, and section 931 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to income from sources within possessions of the United States. Thus, even though all the income of the minister or member of a religious order performing service of the character to which this paragraph is ap\u00ad plicable was derived from sources out\u00ad side the United States, or within posses\u00ad sions of the United States, and therefore may for income tax purposes be excluded from gross income, such income is in\u00ad cluded in computing net earnings from self-employment. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply with respect to a minister or member of a religious order who has been granted an exemption from the payment of the social security self-employment tax on self-employ\u00ad ment tax on self-employment income as ment income as provided in 55 404.1086- 404.1089. (2) Minister in a foreign country whose congregation is composed pre\u00ad dominantly of citizens of the United States. \u2014 (i) Taxable years ending after 1956. For any taxable year ending after 1956, a minister of a church, who en\u00ad gaged in a trade or business within the meaning of section 211(c) of the Act (see 5 5 404.1070(e) and 404.1080), was a citi\u00ad zen of the United States, performed service in the exercise of his ministry in a foreign country, and had a congrega\u00ad tion composed predominantly of citizens of the United States, shall compute his net earnings from self-employment de\u00ad rived from his services as a minister for such taxable year without regard to the exclusion from gross income provided in section 911 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to earned income from sources without the United States. For taxable years ending on or after De\u00ad cember 31, 1957, such minister shall also disregard sections 107 and 119 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 in the computation of his net earnings from self-employment. (See paragraph (a) of this section.) For purposes of section 211(a) (7) of the Act and this paragraph a \"congregation composed predomi\u00ad nantly of citizens of the United States\" means a congregation the majority of which throughout the greater portion of its minister's taxable year were U.S. citi\u00ad zens. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply with respect to a minister who has been granted an exemption from the payment \"of the tax on self- employment income as provided in 5 5 404.1086-404.1889. (ii) Election for taxable years ending after 1954 and before 1957. (a) A minister described in paragraph (c) (2) (i) of this section who, for a taxable year ending after 1954 and be\u00ad fore 1957, had income from service de\u00ad scribed in such paragraph (c) (2) (i) of this section which would have been in\u00ad cluded in computing net earnings from self-employment if such income had been derived in a taxable year ending after 1956 by an individual who had filed a waiver certificate under section 1402(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of FEDERAL REGISTER, V O L 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 PROPOSED RULES 1954 may elect to have section 211(a) (7) of the Act and paragraph (c) (2) (i) of this section apply to his income from such service for his taxable years ending after 1954 and before 1957. If such min\u00ad ister filed a waiver certificate prior to August 1, 1956, in accordance with \u00a7 404.1080, or he files such a waiver cer\u00ad tificate on or before the due date of his return (including an^ extensions there\u00ad of) for his last taxable year ending be\u00ad fore 1957, he must make such election on or before the due date of his return (in\u00ad cluding any extensions thereof) for such taxable year or before April 16, 1957, whichever is the later. If a waiver cer\u00ad tificate is not so filed, the minister must make this election on or before the due date of the return (including any ex\u00ad tensions thereof) for his first taxable year ending after 1956. Notwithstand\u00ad ing the expiration of the period pre\u00ad scribed by section 1402(e) (2) of the In\u00ad ternal Revenue Code of 1954 (see \u00a7404.1081) for filing such waiver, the minister may file a waiver certificate at the time he makes the election. In no event shall an election be valid unless the minister files prior to or at the time of the election a waiver certificate in accordance with \u00a7 404.1080. (b) The election shall be made by fil\u00ad ing with the District Director of Internal Revenue with whom the waiver certifi\u00ad cate, Treasury/IRS Form 2031, is filed a written statement indicating that, by reason of the Social Security Amend\u00ad ments of 1956, the minister desires to have the Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance system established by title n of the Social Security Act ex\u00ad tended to his services performed in a foreign country as a minister of a con\u00ad gregation composed predominantly of U.S. citizens beginning with the first taxable year ending after 1954 and prior to 1957 for which he had income from such services. The statement shall be dated and signed by the minister and shall clearly state that it is an election for retroactive self-employment tax cov\u00ad erage under the Self-Employment Con\u00ad tributions Act of 1954. In addition, the statement shall include the following in\u00ad formation: (1) The name and address of the min\u00ad ister. (2) His social security number, if he has one. (3) That he is a duly ordained, com\u00ad missioned, or licensed minister of a church. (4) That he is a citizen of the United States. (5) That he is performing services in the exercise of his ministry in a foreign country. (6) That his congregation is composed predominantly of citizens of the United States.

(8) That he has or has not filed in\u00ad come tax returns for his taxable years ending after 1954 and before 1957. If he has filed such returns, he shall state the years for which they were filed and in\u00ad dicate the District Director of Internal Revenue with whom they were filed. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in section 1402(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (see \u00a7 404.1082 relating to such provisions), a waiver certificate filed pursuant to \u00a7 404.1080 by a minister making an elec\u00ad tion under this paragraph shall be effec\u00ad tive (regardless of when such certificate is filed) for such minister's first taxable year ending after 1954 in which he had income from service described in para\u00ad graph (c) (2) of this section or for the taxable year of the minister prescribed by section 1402(e) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (see \u00a7 404.1082), if such taxable year is earlier, and for all succeeding taxable years. * * * * * 4. Section 404.1061a is added to read as follows: \u00a7 404.1061a United States citizens tem\u00ad porarily living outside the United States; computation of net earnings. For taxable years beginning after 1972, an individual engaged in a trade or business as described in section 211(c) of the Act, who is a citizen of the United States, who derives earnings from self- employment outside the United States, and who has been a resident of the United States during the entire taxable year, shall compute his net earnings from self-employment without regard to the exclusion from gross income pro\u00ad vided by section 911(a)(2) of the In- ternal*Revenue Code of 1954. Thus, even though all income of the individual to which this section is applicable was derived from sources outside the United States, and therefore may for income tax purposes be excluded from gross income, such income is included in com\u00ad puting net earnings from self-employ\u00ad ment. (See \u00a7 404.1061 relating to minis\u00ad ters or members of a religious order per\u00ad forming services outside the United States.) 5. Section 404.1066 is added to read as follows: \u00a7 404.1066 Options available in comput\u00ad ing net earnings from nonfarm self- employment. (a) In general. For any taxable year beginning after 1972, an individual self- employed on a regular basis as defined in paragraph (d) of this section may use an optional method to determine his net earnings from nonfarm self-employ\u00ad ment. This option is available when the actual net earnings from nonfarm self- employment are less than $1,600 and less than 66% percent of the individual's gross nonfarm income. However, an in\u00ad dividual may not use the nonfarm option with respect to earnings derived in more than 5 taxable years, nor may he report17885 less than his actual net earnings from nonfarm self-employment. (b) Computing net earnings from non\u00ad farm self-employment. An individual who is self-employed on a regular basis as defined ip paragraph (d) of this sec\u00ad tion may, under the optional method of computing net earnings from nonfarm self-employment, report 66% percent of his gross nonfarm self-employment in\u00ad come not to exceed $1,600 as his net earnings from nonfarm self-employ\u00ad ment, if his actual net earnings from such self-employment are less than $1,600 and less than 66% percent of his gross income from such self-employment. Example: A operates a grocery store and files his income tax returns on a calendar year basis. He meets the \"self-employed on a regular basis\" requirement as he had actual net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more in 1971 and in 1972. His gross in\u00ad come and net profit from operating his grocrey store in 1973 through 1975 are as follows: 1 9 7 3 1 9 7 4 1 9 7 5 Gross income _____ $2,800 $1,200 $1,000 Net profit ___k___ 3 0 0 4 0 0 8 0 0 For the year 1973, A may report as his annual net earnings from self-employment either : 1. None. (Actual net earnings from self- employment are less than $400) ; or 2. $1,600. (Nonfarm option, 66% percent of $2,800 but not to exceed the $1,600 maximum.) For the year 1974, A may report as his annual net earnings from self-employment either : 1. $400. (Actual net earnings from self- employment) ; or 2. $800. (Nonfarm option, 66% percent of $1,200.) For the year 1975, A must report $800, his actual net earnings from self-employment. The nonfarm option is1 not available to him because his actual net earnings are not less than 66% percent of his gross income. (c) Computing net earnings from both nonfarm and farm self-employment. An individual who is self-employed on a regular basis may use the nonfarm op\u00ad tional method where both nonfarm and farm businesses are involved, if his ac\u00ad tual net earnings from nonfarm self- employment combined with his actual net earnings from farm self-employ\u00ad ment, or optional net earnings from farm self-employment, if used, are less than $1,600, and the net nonfarm earnings are less than 66% percent of his gross nonfarm self-employment income. If an individual qualifies for using both the nonfarm and farm option, he may report less than his actual total net earnings but not less than his actual net earnings from nonfarm self-employment alone; if he elects to use both options in a given taxable year, the combined maximum reportable net earnings from self-em\u00ad ployment may not exceed $1,600. Example 1 : B operated a grocery store and a farm. He files his income tax return on a calendar year basis. He had actual net earn\u00ad ings from self-employment of $400 or more in 1971 and in 1972 thus meeting the \"self- employed on a regular basis\" test. His gross FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17886PROPOSED RULES income and net profit from operating both of his businesses in 1973 through 1975 are: 1 9 7 3 1 9 7 4 1 9 7 5 Grocery store: Gross income... $1,800 $2,100 $ 1 ,500 Net profit ____ 2 0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0 Farm:Gross income... $2,400 $1,200 $1,200 Net profit. ...... 1 0 0 4 0 0 9 0 0 For the year 1973, B may report as his net earnings from self-employment: 1.

The nonfarm option is not available to B for 1973 if he uses the farm -option because the \"less than $1,600\" requirement would not be met. For the year 1974, B may report as his net earnings from self-employment: 1. $800. (Actual net'earnings from self-em\u00ad ployment $1,200. ($800 farm option (66% percent of farm gross percent of $2,100 grocery store income) and $400 farm profit); or 4. $1,600. ($800 farm option and $1,400 nonfarm option totaling $2,200 but not to exceed the $1,600 maximum). For the year 1975, B may report as his net earnings from self-employment: 1. $1,400. (Actual net earnings from self- employment from both businesses); or 2. $1,300. ($800 farm option (66% percent of farm gross percent of $1,500 grocery store income) and $900 farm profit); or 4. $1,600. ($800 farm option and $1,000 nonfarm option totaling $1,800 reduced to $1,600 so as not to exceed the maximum). Example 2: C was regularly, self-employed having derived actual net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more in 1971 and in 1972. His gross income and net profit from operating both a grocery store and a farm in 1973 are: Grocery Store Gross income- ____________________ _ $1,000 Net profit ___.________________________ 800 Farm Gross income _________________________ $2, 600 Net profit __________________ i_________ 400 For the year 1973, C may report $1,200 (actual net earnings from self-employment from both businesses), or $2,400 ($1,600 farm option (66% percent of $2,600 farm gross in\u00ad come not to exceed $1,600) and $800 grocery store profit). C cannot use the nonfarm op\u00ad tion for 1973 because his actual grocery store net exceeds 66% percent of his grocery store gross income. (d) Self-employed on a regular basis. For any taxable year beginning after 1972, an individual is deemed to be self- employed on a regular basis, or to be a member of a partnership on a regular basis, if in at least 2 of the 3 taxable years immediately preceding such tax\u00ad able year he had actual net earnings from self-employment of not less than $400 from farm and nonfarm trades or businesses (including his distributiveshare of the net income or loss from any partnership of which he is a member). 6. Section 404.1068 is amended by de\u00ad leting paragraph (b) (2), redesignating paragraph (b) (3) as (b) (2) and by re\u00ad vising paragraphs (b) (1) and (c) to read as follows; \u00a7 404.1068 Self-employment income. * * * * * (b) Maximum creditable self-employ\u00ad ment income. (1) The maximum credit\u00ad able self-employment income of an in\u00ad dividual for any taxable year (whether a period of 12 months or less) is (i) The excess of\u2014 (a) For taxable years ending before 1955, $3,600, (b) For taxable years ending after 1954 and before 1959, $4,200, (c) For taxable years ending after 1958 and before 1966, $4,800, (d) For taxable years ending after 1965 and before 1968, $6,600, (e) For taxable years ending after 1967 and beginning before 1972, $7,800. (/) For taxable years beginning after 1971 and before 1973, $9,000, (g) For taxable years beginning after 1972 and before 1974, $10,800, ih) For taxable years beginning after 1973 and before 1975, $13,200, (1) For taxable years beginning after 1974, an amount equal to the contribu\u00ad tion and benefit base as determined un\u00ad der section 230 of the Act which is effec\u00ad tive for such calendar year, which is (l ) $14,100 for taxable years beginning after 1974 and before 1976, (2) $15,300 for taxable years beginning after 1975, (3) $16,500 for taxable years beginning after 1976, (ii) over the amount of any wages (as defined in section 209 of the Act) paid to such individual in such taxable, year. For example, if during the taxable year ending in 1973 the individual had $12,000 of net earnings from self-employment, and was paid $1,000 of such wages he had only $9,800 of creditable self-employment income for the taxable year. * * * * (c) Minimum net earnings from self- employment. Self-Employment income does not include th\u00e8 net earnings from self-employment of an individual when the amoiyit of ' such earnings for the tax\u00ad able year is less than $400. Thus, an indi\u00ad vidual having only $300 of net earnings from self-employment for the taxable year would not have any creditable self- employment income. However, an indi\u00ad vidual having net earnings from self-em\u00ad ployment of $400 or more for the tax\u00ad able year may have less than $400 of creditable self-employment income. This could occur in a case in which th\u00e8 amount of the individual's net earnings from self-employment is $400 or more for a taxable year and the amount of such net earnings from self-employment plus the amount of the wages paid to the individual during that taxable year ex\u00ad ceed the maximum creditable earnings as prescribed in section 211(c) of the Act (see paragraph (b) of this section) for such year. For example, if an individualhad net earnings from self-employment of $1,000 for 1973, and was also paid wages of $10,500 during 1973, his credit\u00ad able self-employment income for 1973 was $300. * * $ * $ 7. Section 404.1070 is amended by re\u00ad vising paragraphs (d) (1), (1) (i) and (d) (2), (e ), and (g) to read as follows: \u00a7 404.1070 Trade or business. $ $ * * * (d) Members of certain professions \u2014 (1) Professional service exclusion.

However, service performed by a Christian Science practitioner in the exercise of his profession during taxable years ending after 1967 constitutes a trade or business within the meaning of section 211(c) of the Act, unless an ex\u00ad emption from such coverage has been granted on the basis of filing for such exemption pursuant to \u00a7 404.1087. * * * * * (e) Ministers and members of religious orders \u2014 (1) General. Except as provided in \u00a7 404.1080 and \u00a7 404.1087, the perform\u00ad ance of services by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church in the exercise of his ministry, or by a member of a religious order in the exercise of duties required by such order does not constitute a trade or busi\u00ad ness within the meaning of section 211 (c) of the Act. (2) Taxable years ending before 1968. The Social Security Amendments of 1954 extended coverage on an individual elective basis to duly ordained, commis\u00ad sioned, or licensed ministers of a church and members of religious orders who had not taken a vow of poverty effective for taxable years ending after 1954. Those who elected coverage are con\u00ad sidered as self-employed persons, even though working in the exercise of their ministry as employees. To have elected coverage a minister, performing service described in \u00a7 404.1015, must have filed an irrevocable waiver certificate (see \u00a7\u00a7404.1080-404.1086). (3) Taxable years ending after 1967. The Social Security Amendments of 1967 extended self-employment coverage of ministerial service, described in \u00a7 404.- 1015, performed by duly ordained, com\u00ad missioned, or licensed ministers and members of religious orders who have not taken a vow of poverty for all taxa- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 PROPOSED RULES 17887 ble years ending after 1967, unless the minister has been granted an exemption from such coverage by the Internal Revenue Service on the basis of timely filing for such an exemption (see \u00a7\u00a7 404.- 1087-404.1089). Service performed by members of religious orders who have taken a vow of poverty which are in the exercise of the duties required by the order are not covered by the self-em\u00ad ployment provisions of the Act.

The performance of the functions of a public office does not constitute a trade or business, except as provided in paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section for certain fee basis public officers and employees. The term \"pub\u00ad lic officers and employees. The term \"public office\" includes any elective or appointive office of the United States or any possession thereof, the District of Columbia, or of a State or its subdivision, or of a wholly owned instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing. For ex\u00ad ample, the President, the Vice President, a governor, a mayor, the Secretary of State, a member of Congress, a State rep\u00ad resentative, a county commissioner, a judge, a county or city attorney, a marshal, a sheriff, a register of deeds, or a notary public performs the functions of a public office. (1) Self-employment on fee basis. Ef\u00ad fective with taxable years beginning after 1 9 6 7 , services performed by public offi\u00ad cers and employees of State and local governments in positions compensated solely on a fee basis constitute a trade or business under the self-employment pro\u00ad visions of the Social Security Act if such services are eligible for (but are not made the subject of) an agreement between the State and the Secretary of Health, Edu\u00ad cation, and Welfare pursuant to section 2 1 8 of the Act to extend social security coverage thereto. (Since notaries public are not \"employees\" within the meaning of section 218 of the Social Security Act, their services are not eligible for an agreement under that section. Accord\u00ad ingly, such services do not constitute a trade or business.) If an individual per- t0T .services for a State or political subdivision thereof in any period in more nan one position, each position is treated separately for purpose of deter\u00ad mining whether he is engaging in a trade business on a fee basis.

Thus, ministers, members of re\u00ad ligious orders, and Christian Science practitioners requesting exemption from social security coverage must meet either of two alternative tests: (i) A religious principles test which refers to the in\u00ad stitutional principles and discipline of the particular religious denomination to which he belongs, or (ii) a conscien\u00ad tious opposition test which refers to the opposition because of religious consid\u00ad erations of individual ministers, mem\u00ad bers of religious orders, and Christian Science practitioners (rather than op\u00ad position based upon the general con\u00ad science of any such individual or indi\u00ad viduals) . (2) The term \"public insurance\", as used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17888 PROPOSED RULES refers to governmental, as distinguished from private, insurance and does not in\u00ad clude insurance carried with a commer\u00ad cial insurance carrier. To be eligible to file an application for exemption on Treasury/IRS Form 4361, a minister, member of a religious order, or Chris\u00ad tian Science practitioner need not be opposed to the acceptance of all public insurance making payments of this spec\u00ad ified type; he must, however, be opposed on religious grounds to the acceptance of any such payment which, in whole or in part, is based on, or measured by earn\u00ad ings from services performed by him in his capacity as a minister, member of a religious order, or Christian Science practitioner. For example, a minister performing service in the exercise of his ministry may be eligible to file an 'appli\u00ad cation for exemption on Treasury/IRS Form 4361 even though he is not op\u00ad posed to the acceptance of benefits under the Social Security Act with respect to service performed by him which is not in the exercise of his ministry. (c) Approval of application for ex\u00ad emption. The filing of an application for exemption on Treasury/IRS Form 4361 by a minister, a member of a re\u00ad ligious order, or a Christian Science practitioner does not constitute an ex\u00ad emption from the tax on self-employ\u00ad ment income with respect to services performed by him in his capacity as a minister, member, or practitioner. The exemption is granted only if the appli\u00ad cation is approved by an appropriate internal revenue officer. \u00a7 404.1088 Time limitation for filing application for exemption. (a) General rule. (1) Any individual who desires an exemption from the tax on self-employment income with respect to service performed by him in his capac\u00ad ity as a minister or member of a re\u00ad ligious order or as a Christian Science practitioner must file the application for exemption (Treasury/IRS Form 4361) on or before whichever of the following dates is later: (i) The due date of the income tax return, including any extension thereof for his second taxable year ending after 1967, or (ii) The due date of the income tax return, including any extension thereof, for his second taxable year beginning after 1953, for which he has net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more, any part of which: (a) In the case of a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a churchy consists of remuneration for service performed in the exercise of his ministry; or (b) In the case of a member of a re\u00ad ligious order who has not taken a vow of poverty as a member of such order, con\u00ad sists of remuneration for service per\u00ad formed in the exercise of duties required by such order; or (c) In the case of a Christian Science practitioner, consists of remuneration for service performed in the exercise of his profession as a Christian Science prac\u00ad titioner.(2) No part of the net earnings from self-employment (computed as pre\u00ad scribed in paragraph (c) of this section) for the taxable year shall be considered as derived from service performed as a minister, member of a religious order, or Christian Science practitioners if he de\u00ad rived his gross income in the taxable year both from service performed in such capacity and from the conduct of an\u00ad other trade or business, and the deduc\u00ad tions allowed by Chapter I of the Inter\u00ad nal Revenue Code which are attributable to the gross income derived from service performed in such capacity equal or ex\u00ad ceed the gross income derived from service performed in such capacity. (3) The application of the rules set forth in paragraphs (a)(1 ) and (a)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples: Example 1. M, who makes his income tax returns on a calendar year basis, was or\u00ad dained as a minister in January 1960. During each of two or more taxable years ending before 1968 M has net earnings for self- employment in excess of $400 some part of which is from service performed in the exer\u00ad cise of his ministry. M has not filed an effec\u00ad tive waiver certififcate on Treasury/IRS Form 2031 (See \u00a7\u00a7 404,1080ff.). If M desires an exemption from the tax on self-employ\u00ad ment income with respect to seryice per\u00ad formed in the exercise of his ministry, he must file an application for exemption on or before the due date of his income tax re\u00ad turn for 1969 (his second taxable year end\u00ad ing after 1967), or any extension thereof. Example 2. M, who makes his income tax returns on a calendar year basis, was or\u00ad dained as a minister in January 1966. M has net earnings of $350 for the taxable year 1966 and has net earnings of $350 for the taxable year 1966 and has net earnings in excess of $400 for each of his taxable years 1967 and 1968 (some part or all of which is derived from service performed in the exer\u00ad cise of his ministry). M has not filed an ef\u00ad fective waiver certificate on Treasury/IRS Form 2031 (see \u00a7\u00a7 404.1080ff.). If M desires an exemption from the tax on self-employ\u00ad ment income with respect to service per\u00ad formed in the exercise of his ministry, he must file an application for exemption on or before the due date -of his income tax re\u00ad turn for 1969 (his second taxable year end\u00ad ing after 1967), or any extension thereof. Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 2 except that M has net earnings in excess of $400 for each of his taxable years 1967 and 1969 (but less than $400 in 1968). The application for exemption must be filed on or before the due date of his income tax return for 1969, or any extension thereof Example 4. M was ordained as a minister in May 1973. During each of the taxable years 1973 and 1975, M, who makes his income tax returns on a calendar year basis, derived net earnings in excess of $400 from his ac- tivties as a minister. M had net earnings of $350 for the taxable^ year 1974, $200 of which was derived from service performed by him in the exercise of his ministry. If M desires an exemption from the tax on self- employment income with respect to service performed in the exercise of his ministry, he must file an application for exemption on or before the due date of his income tax re\u00ad turn for 1975, or any extension thereof. Example 5. M, who was ordained a minister in January 1973, is employed as a toolmaker by the XYZ Corporation for the taxable years 1973 and 1974 and also engages in activties as a minister on weekends. M makes his in\u00adcome tax returns on the basis of a calendar year. During each of the taxable years 1973 and 1974 M receives wages of $10,800 and $13,200 respectively from the XYZ Corpora\u00ad tion and derives net earnings of $400 from his activities as a minister. If M desires an exemption from the tax on self-employment income with respect to service performed in the exercise of his ministry he must file an application for exemption on or before the due date of his income tax return for 1974, or any extension thereof. It should be noted that although by reason of section 211(b) (1) (G) and (H) of the Act and section 1402(b) (1) (G ) and (H) of the Internal Revenue Code no part of the $400 represents \"self- employment income,\" nevertheless the en\u00ad tire $400 constitutes \"net earnings from self-emplolyment\" for purposes of fulfilling the requirements of section 1402(e) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code. Example 6. M, who files his income tax re\u00ad turns on a calendar year basis, was ordained as a minister in March 1973. During 1973 he receives $410 for service performed in the exercise of his ministry. In addition to his ministerial services, M is engaged during the year 1973 in a mercantile venture from which he derives net earnings from self-employ\u00ad ment in the amount of $4,000. The expenses incurred by him in connection with his ministerial services during 1973 and which are allowable deductions under Chapter I of the internal Revenue Code amount to $410. During 1974 and 1975, M has net earn\u00ad ings from self-employment in amounts of $4,600 and $4,800'respectively, and some part of each of these amounts is from the exer\u00ad cise of his ministry. The deductions allowed in each of the years 1974 and 1975 by Chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code which are attributable to the gross income derived by M from the exercise of his ministry in each of such years, respectively, do not equal or exceed such gross income in such year. If M desires an exemption from the tax on self- employment income with respect to service performed in the exercise of his ministry, he must file an application for exemption on or before the due date of his income tax return for 1975, or any extension thereof. (b) Effect of death. The right of an individual to file an application for ex\u00ad emption shall cease upon his death. Thus, the surviving spouse, administra\u00ad tor, or executor of a decedent shall not be permitted to file an application for exemption for such decedent. (c) Computation of net earnings \u2014 (1) Taxable years ending before 1968. Net earnings from self-employment for taxable years ending before 1968 shall be determined without regard to the fact that without an election (Treasury/IRS Form 2031) under section 1402(e) of the Internal Revenue Code (as in effect prior to amendment by section 115(b )(2) of the Social Security Amendments of 1967), the performance of services by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church in the exercise of his ministry, or by a member of a re\u00ad ligious order in the exercise of duties re\u00ad quired by such order, or the performance of service by an individual in th\u00e8 exer\u00ad cise of his profession as a Christian Sci\u00ad ence practitioner, does not constitute a trade or business for purposes of the tax on self-employment income, (2) Taxable years ending after 1967. Net earnings from self-employment for taxable years ending after 1967 shall be determined without regard to the fact FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 PROPOSED RULES 17889 that Treasury/IRS Form 2031 has not been filed. Services performed by duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed min\u00ad isters, members of religious orders who have not taken a vow of poverty, and Christian Science practitioners are cov\u00ad ered unless the individual has been granted an exemption from such cover\u00ad age pursuant to the'procedures outlined in \u00a7 404.1087(b). \u00a7 404.1089 Period for which exemption is effective. (a) In general. If an application for exemption on Treasury/IRS Form 4361 is filed by a > minister, a member of a religious order, or a Christian Science practitioner eligible to file such an ap\u00ad plication and is approved, the exemption from the tax on self-employment income shall be effective for the first taxable year ending after 1967 for which such minister, member, or practitioner has net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more any part of which was derived from the performance of service in his capacity as a minister, member, or prac\u00ad titioner, and for all succeeding taxable years. However, the exemption applies only to income derived from services which the individual performs in his exercise of the ministry, or in his exer\u00ad cise of duties required by the religious order, or from his practice as a Christian Science practitioner. (b) Exemption irrevocable. An exemp\u00ad tion granted to a minister, a member of a religious order, or a Christian Science practitioner pursuant to the provisions of section 1402(e) of the Internal Rev\u00ad enue Code is irrevocable.

In the consolidation of hazardous ma\u00ad terials regulations (41 FR 15972) the hazardous articles of 46 CFR 146.27 were reclassified as ORM (other regulated materials) in Title 49. In order to update the Table of Permitted Cargoes in \u00a7 148.- 01-7, it is proposed that all hazardous materials now classified as hazardous ar\u00ad ticles be classified as ORM. It is proposed to relax the shipping paper requirements, 46 CFR 148.02-1, for unmanned barges transporting solid hazardous material in bulk to allow the shipping papers to be kept on board the towing vessel; and it is proposed to ex\u00ad empt unmanned barges from the re\u00ad quirements for a dangerous cargo mani\u00ad fest, 46 CFR 148.02-3, when transporting solid hazardous materials in bulk. It is proposed that the specified mois\u00ad ture content of coconut pellets be revised to conform with the consolidation- of hazardous materials (41 FR 15972) and the entry for tankage, garbage or rough ammoniate solid be revised to specify a moisture content of more than 7 percent because at 7 percent moisture or less this item is a flammable solid and not per\u00ad mitted in bulk. It is proposed that the special require\u00ad ments for metal borings, shavings, turnings or cuttings (\u00a7 148.04-13) be amended to exempt this item from the requirements of \u00a7 148.04-13 when shipped in unmanned barges and transported en\u00ad tirely on the navigable waters of the United States. This exemption is based on a relaxation previously included in 46 CFR 146 that was inadvertently omitted from the amendments. It is proposed that a special additional requirement for the carriage of \"Lime, unslaked\" be added that is consistent with the previous requirement of 46 CFR 146.27-29 which provided for the carriage of this material in bulk. In consideration of the foregoing, it is proposed to amend Part 148 of Title 46 Code of Federal Regulations as follows: 1.

Because of objections raised to certain limitations placed on the 7-day log, a 4-day log was proposed as an alternative solution to overcome anticipated difficulties. Com\u00ad ments received on the proposed 4-day log were generally favorable including some preferring approval of the previously proposed 7-day log. Several carriers indi\u00ad cated that they could see no savings and would continue using the daily log. There were others, that although they approved of the 4-day log suggested an 8-day log, or a 5-day log based on their type of operation. In reviewing all the comments submit\u00ad ted in response to both Notices, the American Trucking Associations, Inc., suggested that the concept of a multi-day log be adopted with a maximum limit of 7 days to a sheet. This suggestion appears to have merit and is therefore being proposed. A copy of the multi-day log together with revisions to the instructions con\u00ad tained in \u00a7 395.8 for completing it, is re\u00ad produced below. The first section or unit will be the daily log, if used singely. This unit must be the first unit on a single sheet of paper when using more than 1 day since the additional units do not con\u00ad tain the information shown on the top half portion of the first unit. The first unit shall not be less than 7\" x 3\" and the additional units shall not be less than 7\" x 2\". All units must have at least a 1\" of space for the remarks section. There are three items not included in the proposed multi-log that are included in the present daily log. These are origin, destination and total mileage today. The instructions for preparing the log shall be printed on either the front or back cover of the log book. In addition, a daily recap of the total hours worked and hours available must be provided witheach log book. (An executed specimen multi-log will be provided in any final rule that may be issued). A motor carrier will have the option of using either the daily log or any combi\u00ad nation up to 7 days of logs on one sheet to suit his particular operation. It is pro\u00ad posed that carriers be limited to only one combination of daily logs. Carriers that elect to use a multi-day log must use it for all drivers in their employ that are subject to the daily log requirement. Con\u00ad version to a multi-day log may com\u00ad mence at any time a carrier chooses. However, if a safety survey reveals that the multi-day logs are being prepared in such a manner that the Safety Investi\u00ad gator is having a serious problem in mak\u00ad ing his survey, it is proposed that the Director, Regional Motor Carrier Safety Office issue a notice requiring that carrier to cease using the multi-day log and use the single day log only. Interested persons are invited to sub\u00ad mit written data, views, or arguments pertaining to adoption of the new format. All comments should refer to the Docket number and Notice number that appears at the top of this document and should be submitted in three copies to the Director, Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety, Washington, D.C. 20590. Com\u00ad ments received before the close of busi\u00ad ness on July 1, 1977, will be considered before further action is taken. Com\u00ad ments received will be available for examination by any interested person in the Docket Room of the Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety, Room 3404, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20590, both before and after the closing date for comments. 1.

However, upon a written request to, and with the approval of, the Director, Regional Motor Carrier Safety Office, for the Region in which a motor carrier has his principal place of business, a motorcarrier may forward and retain such logs at a regional or terminal office.

CIVIL AERONAUTICS BOARD [Docket No. 29123, etc.; Agreement CAB 26439 R -l\u2014R-4, etc.; Order 77-3-162] INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION Agreements Relating to Passenger Fare, Cargo Rate and Currency Matters; Order Adopted by the Civil Aeronautics Board at its office in Washington, D.C. on the 29th day of March, 1977. (Docket Nos. 29123, 27573; Agreement C.A.B. C.A.B. 26488.) Agreements have been filed with the Board pursuant to section 412(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (the Act) and Part 261 of the Board's Economic Regulations between various air car\u00ad riers, foreign air carriers, and, other car- Traffic Conferences of the International Air Transport Association (IA T A ). Agreement C.A.B. 26439 was adopted at the Eighth Meeting of the IATA Cargo Agency Committee held in Ft. Lauder\u00ad dale, November 29-December 2, 1976. The agreement, inter alia, revalidates and amends certain elements of the re\u00ad duced-fare program for IATA cargo agents. The existing productivity feature for U.S.-based agents, which provides re\u00ad duced-fare tickets above the normal yearly allotment where an agent's an\u00ad nual commissionable international sales exceed the average for all U.S. agents by a specified amount, would be revalidated through December 31, 1979. The exten\u00ad sion of retroactive discounts, granted where an agent shows good cause for not having submitted the normal advance application, would be limited to a period of three months from the date of ticket purchase . 1 Finally, reduced tickets for agents' travel to group training courses would be permitted for courses of two- five days' duration rather than the pres\u00ad ent three-five days , 2 The Board will ap\u00ad prove the resolutions inasmuch as they merely revalidate existing provisions al\u00ad ready approved; limit the potential for abuse under the retroactive discount provisions; or do not affect U.S.-based agents. Agreements C.A.B. 26483, 26486 and 26488, adopted at the recent currency conference in Cannes, largely involve amendments to currently effective cur- 2 presently there is no time limitation. ,\" ec*uce<f tickets for training courses are - i? ,vaA la'k*e U.S. agents due to the \"i^PProvals of governing resolution 9s U S- aSents ln Order 76-3-160, March 1976 and 74-3-109, March 26, 1974.rency surcharge and discount resolutions from foreign points, intended to align selling fares in local curency more closely with recent fluctuations in exchange rates. Agreement C.A.B. 26486 would also extend the validity of several resolutions which set up the basic framework by which IATA hopes to move toward a new fare and rate specification system based on the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Right (SDR) 3 . Finally, the method of calculating fares sold outside the country of com\u00ad mencement of travel would be clarified to further limit potential misuse of tickets sold in third countries; and the calculation of currency-related dis\u00ad counts on cargo rates from strong-cur\u00ad rency countries would also be clarified. The Board will approve the proposed amendments to these previously ap\u00ad proved resolutions subject, where appli\u00ad cable, to previous conditions. We would note that the method of calculating dis\u00ad counts on cargo rates specifies rounding up in all cases, and is subject to the Board's recently-imposed condition on all rounding procedures, which stipu\u00ad lated normal rounding-up or down to be effective April 1, 1977. (See Order 77-2- 22, February 3, 1977.) Pan American World Airways, Inc. (Pan American), in a motion, states that, although it does not object to the rounding procedure specified by the Board, it nevertheless believes that the Board should delay the implementation date until October 1, 1977, insofar as it relates to cargo rates. In support of its request, Pan American asserts that the 3 These resolutions were approved with conditions by Order 76-4-135, April 26, 1976.April 1 date poses no practical tariff- filing problem for pasenger fares which generally change on that date anyway. Cargo rates, however, are ordinarily published with a September 30 expiry date and for the carriers to meet the April 1 requirement would require a worldwide tariff revision entailing con\u00ad siderable cost (which Pan American estimates at $60,000 out-of-pocket alone). If the implementation of the condition is delayed until October 1, it can be undertaken as part of the annual worldwide cargo tariff revision. The Board has determined to grant Pan American's motion, and will amend the effective date of our condition inso\u00ad far as it relates to cargo rates to Octo\u00ad ber 1, 1977. The intent of our action in Order 77-2-22 was to provide uniformity with previous Board conditions relating to rounding, and thus avoid confusion in fare and rate construction. Besides the consideration of extra costs to the carriers in publishing, an extra world\u00ad wide tariff revision, we believe that im\u00ad plementation on October 1,1977, the tra\u00ad ditional date for worldwide cargo rate revisions, will assure the most orderly transition with the least possible con\u00ad fusion. The Board, acting pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and partic\u00ad ularly sections 102, 204(a) and 412 thereof, does not find that the following resolutions, which have direct of indi\u00ad rect application in air transportation as defined by the Act and are incorporated in the agreements indicated, are ad\u00ad verse to the public interest or in vio\u00ad lation of the Act, provided that approval is subject, where applicable, to condi\u00ad tions previously imposed by the Board: A C a\" XN oA Title Application 26439: R - l ______ R - -2......... 003 R -3 ......... 022kkStandard Revalidation Resolution (N e w ).

Ph yllis T. Kaylor No. 30465] SPANTAX, S.A. AND OVERSEAS NATIONAL AIRWAYS, INC. - Proposed Approval of Application Notice is hereby given, pursuant to the statutory requirements of section 408(b) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, that the undersigned intends to issue the attached order under dele\u00ad gated authority. Interested persons are hereby afforded until April 14, 1977, within which to file comments or request a hearing with respect to the action pro\u00ad posed in the order. Dated at Washington, D.C., March .30, 1977. Ph yllis T. Kaylor , Secretary. [Docket No. 30465] Spantax , S.A. and Overseas National Airways , Inc. O R D E R GRANTING APPROVAL OP APPLICATION Issued under delegated authority. Spantax, S.A. (Spantax) and Overseas Na\u00ad tional Airways, Inc. (ONA) have requested that the Board approve without hearing, pursuant to the third proviso of section 408 (b) of 'the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the Act), the lease of one DC-8\u2014 61 aircraft by ONA to Spantax. By amend\u00ad ment to their application, Spantax and ONA have requested that the Board approve a conditional sales contract in lieu of the lease. ONA is a certificated supplemental air car\u00ad rier authorized to perform domestic, trans\u00ad atlantic, and Caribbean air transportation.Spantax holds a foreign air carrier permit under section 402 of the Act which author\u00ad izes transatlantic charter service to and from the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, Span- tax is required to make monthly payments of $98,000 for a minimum of two years. At the end of two years, it has a choice of ter\u00ad minating the agreement through payment of $50,000, of purchasing the aircraft outright for a fixed sum, or of continuing the agree\u00ad ment for two-year terms ending in 1958. Should it choose to purchase the aircraft, during this period, Spantax has the option of acquiring title to the aircraft at any time upon 120 days' notice. Unless Spantax pays the $50,000 termination fee in 1985, it is re\u00ad quired to pay the purchase price and take title to the aircraft. Spantax is to provide insurance and flight crews and all-\u00bb necessary overhauls, modifica\u00ad tions, and repairs to the aircraft. Spantax is also required to make periodic payments into a reserve account for overhaul expenses. Pay\u00ad ments are based on aircraft usage. Unused funds are to be returned to Spantax at the termination of the contract by payment of the $50,000 fee. Upon taking title to the air\u00ad craft, Spantax has a right to the entire account. In support of their request, Spantax and ONA assert, inter alia, that the transaction would be subject to the exemption provided by Part 299 of the Board's Economic Regu\u00ad lations but for the fact that Spantax is not an air carrier;1 that the transaction was the result of arm's length bargaining; that there are no control or interlocking rela\u00ad tionships between ONA and Spantax; and that the transaction will not interfere with ONA's service commitments, but will, on the contrary, assist financially in the introduc\u00ad tion of two DC-10 aircraft into ONA's fleet. The applicants have also requested expe\u00ad dited action so that the aircraft can be de\u00ad livered to Spantax at the earliest possible date. No objections to the application or re\u00ad quests for a hearing have been received. Notice of intent to dispose of this appli\u00ad cation without a hearing has been published in the Federal Register , and a copy of such notice has been furnished by the Board to the Attorney G\u00e9n\u00e9ral not later than the day following the date of such publication, both in accordance with the requirements of sec\u00ad tion 408(b) of the Act. Upon consideration of the above, it is con\u00ad cluded that ONA is an air carrier, that Span- tax is a person engaged in a phase of aero\u00ad nautics, and that the aircraft involved in the contemplated transaction constitutes a sub\u00ad stantial part of the properties of ONA, all within the meaning of section 408 of the Act; and that the transaction is therefore subject to that section. However, it is further 1 The aircraft involved constitutes 6.2 per\u00ad cent of ONA's aircraft, 9.5 percent of its overall lift capacity, and 12.3 percent of the market value of ONA's fleet.concluded that the above-described transac\u00ad tion will not affect the control of an air carrier directly engaged in the operation of aircraft in air transportation or tend to un\u00ad reasonably restrain trade, substantially lessen competition, or create a monopoly. This transaction was entered into after arm's length bargaining and there appear to be no interlocking or control relationships between ONA, on the one hand, and Spantax, on the other. Furthermore, no person disclosing a substantial interest in the proceeding is cur\u00ad rently requesting a hearing, and it is con\u00ad cluded that the public interest does not re\u00ad quire a hearing. It does not appear that ONA will be hindered in performing its certificate obligations since ONA will be taking delivery of two DC-10 aircraft shortly after the sub\u00ad ject lease takes effect. It thus appears that the transaction will not be inconsistent with the public interest or leave the requirements of section 408 of the Act otherwise unful\u00ad filled. It is therefore found, pursuant to author - its duly delegated by the Board in the Board's regulations, 14 CF 385.13, that the transac\u00ad tion as described above should be approved without hearing, pursuant to the third pro\u00ad viso of section 408(b) of the Act.3 Accordingly, it is ordered, That: The ap\u00ad plication for approval of the transaction de\u00ad scribed herein be and it hereby is approved. Persons entitled to petition the Board for review of this order pursuant to the Board's regulations 14 CFR 385.50 may file such peti\u00ad tions within 10 days of the date of service of this order. This order shall be effective immediately and the filing of such petitions shall not stay its effectiveness.

[PR Doc.77-9921 Piled 4-l-77;8:45 am] National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE OBSERVER PROGRAM Fishing by Foreign Vessels in Waters Under the Jurisdiction of the United States of America The Director, National Marine Fish\u00ad eries Service, (the \"Director\" ) hereby issues notice of an observer program for foreign vessels fishing in the waters over which the United States exercises ex\u00ad clusive fishery management authority pursuant to the Fishery Conservationand Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801-1882) (the \"Act\"). Section 201(c) (2) (D) of the Act requires that any foreign nation which enters into a gov\u00ad erning international fishery agreement, and the owner or operator of any fishing vessel fishing pursuant to such agree\u00ad ment, \" * * * will abide by the require\u00ad ment that * * * duly authorized United States observers be permitted on board any such vessel and that the United States be reimbursed for the cost of such observers.\" Certain other requirements concerning the observer program, with which the foreign nation and the owner or opera\u00ad tor of the fishing vessel must comply, are set forth in the Department of Com- merce/NOAA/NMFS Foreign Fishing Regulations, at 50 CFR 611.8 (42 FR 8813, 8817, February 11, 1977). This observer program is being estab\u00ad lished to meet the need of the United States to obtain onboard catch and effort data that are essential to the continued management of those fishery resources allocated to foreign nations and to deter\u00ad mine compliance with the regulations promulgated for those fisheries. There\u00ad fore the responsibilities of the observers and the methods and procedures for im\u00ad plementation of the observer program are presented. Purpose op Observer Program Observers will be primarily responsible for data collection, including foreign ves\u00ad sel total catch, catch composition, fish\u00ad ing effort, gear utilized, disposition of catch, vessel efficiency, marine mammal catch, and biological sampling. Observ\u00ad ers will record any violations of regula\u00ad tions and the terms of vessel permits and will determine the accuracy of foreign vessel reporting. The observers will not have direct enforcement responsibilities. However, their presence may serve as a deterrent to violations of U.S. regula\u00ad tions. The observers' records may be used in subsequent enforcement actions and in planning for deployment of ob\u00ad servers and agents in future years. Foreign Vessel Coverage The use of observers aboard fishing vessels will be limited to the level needed for providing a technically valid statis\u00ad tical sample of data for each fishery and to provide a presence to insure compli\u00ad ance with U.S. regulations. Allocations, the nature of the fishery, the incidental catch, the history of compliance in the fishery, and the number of vessels per\u00ad mitted to fish will be used to determine which vessels and nations will receive observers and in what number. Initial observer coverage for the 1977 program will be established at approximately the 20 percent level, although this may vary in the individual fisheries based upon the above considerations. After some op\u00ad erational experience has been gained, the effectiveness of this level of coverage will be evaluated. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 178% NOTICES Deployment of Observers In 1977, observers will be placed on vessels of the following nations operat\u00ad ing in the Northwest Atlantic: Bulgaria Prance German Democratic Republic Italy Japan PolandRepublic of Korea Romania Spain Union of Soviet Socialist Republics West Germany Observers will also be placed aboard foreign fishing vessels of the following nations operating in the North and West Pacific: Japan Republic of Korea Poland Union of Soviet Republic of China Socialist Republics (Taiwan)These costa will be accumulated for the period March L 1977 through Decern^ ber 31,1977. Thelisting of observer costs will be transmitted by February 15, 1978 to the Office of Fisheries Management, NMFS (F3), Washington, D.C. 20235 for the preparation of a request for billing to the Central Accounting Branch (AD54), NOAA Finance Division, NBOC- 1, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Bills for Collection prepared by the Central Ac\u00ad counting Branch covering payments due will be sent via covering transmittal memo to the Department of State, Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Oceans and Fisheries Affairs (AES/OFA/ F A ): Attn: Coast Guard Fisheries En\u00ad forcement Officer, Washington, D.C. 20520, for forwarding to the foreign na\u00ad tions. / ( Observers also will be placed aboard vessels of other nations subsequently au\u00ad thorized to fish. Physically placing the observers on foreign fishing vessels will be accomplished by a variety of means, including boarding the vessel in its home port, having the Coast Guard arrange for boarding on the high seas, and per\u00ad mitting the foreign vessel to enter se\u00ad lected U.S. ports to pick up observers. Observer Program Costs and Billin g - The United States will recover the full costs of the observer program including appropriate costs of NMFS, NOAA, Navy, and Coast Guard. The NMFS will pre\u00ad pare a single bill which will be submitted to each foreign nation or that nation's agent for payment. The rationale used to calculate each nation's bill will be made available to that foreign nation. Billing actual costs to each nation should provide an incentive to foreign nations to minimize the need for ob\u00ad servers. It should encourage the adher\u00ad ence to regulations and the reporting of accurate statistics. It may further pro\u00ad vide incentives to cooperate with the U.S. in reducing the costs of placing observers on board vessels. It is currently estimated that the aver\u00ad age trip of two months for each observer will cost the U.S. government about $4,000, including both direct and indirect support costs. The exact cost will be de\u00ad termined by the National Marine Fish\u00ad eries Service, NOAA, as indicated in the accounting records of the applicable Financial Management Centers (FMCs). FMC records will be broken down into sufficient detail to indicate the name of the observer, the vessel, the foreign na\u00ad tion and the fishery, as well as the time period covered by the costs, and the amounts applicable to support costs.All payments received must be drawn in U.S. dollars, payable at a bank in the United States and be made payable to the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA. Payments should be sent to the Director, National Marine Fisheries Service, Attn: F3, Washington, D.C. 20235. Payments may be made in the United States also at NOAA Field Finance Offices located at 1700 Westlake Avenue, North, Seattle, Washington 98109, and at 75 Virginia Beach Drive, Building 2, Miami, Florida 33149. Public Notice The Director has determined that the Observer Program outlined herein is equitable and will be effective within the intent of the Act. Note.\u2014The National Marine Fisheries Service has determined that this document does not contain rulemaking and therefore does not require the preparation of an Eco\u00ad nomic Impact Statement under Executive Order 11821 and OMB Circular A-107.

On June 30, 1975, the FEA issued a prohibition order to the above-listed powerplant which prohibited the power- plant from burning natural gas or pe\u00ad troleum products as its primary energy source. The prohibition order provided, however, that in accordance with the re\u00ad quirements of 10 CFR Parts 303 and 305, the order would not become effective un\u00ad til either, (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notifies the FEA, in accordance with sec\u00ad tion 119(d) (1) (B) of the Clean Air Act, that a particular powerplant will be able on and after July 1, 1975, to bum coal and to comply with all applicable air pol\u00ad lution requirements without a compli\u00ad ance date extension under Section 119, or (2) if no notification is given by EPA, the date that the Administrator of EPA certifies pursuant to Section 119 (d )(1 )(B ) of the Clean Air Act is the earliest date that a particular powerplant will be able to comply with all applicable air pollution requirements under section 119 of that Act; and, until FEA has per\u00ad formed an analysis of the environmental impact of the issuance of a Notice of Ef\u00adfectiveness, pursuant to 10 CFR 305.9, ' and has served the powerplant the Notice of Effectiveness, as provided in 10 CFR 303.10(b), 303.37 (b) , and 305.7. The FEA has analyzed and reviewed the effect on the human environment of issuance of the Notice of Effectiveness, and has determined it is clear that is\u00ad suance of a Notice of Effectiveness for the prohibition order to the above-listed powerplant is not a \"major Federal ac\u00ad tion significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\" National En\u00ad vironmental Policy Act, at 42 U.S.C. 4332(2) (C). Therefore, pursuant to 1 0 CFR 208.4(c), FEA concludes that an environmental impact statement is not required.

Take notice that on March 7, 1977, Central Power and Light Company (CP&L) and West Texas Utilities Com\u00ad pany (W TU) (collectively called the Pe\u00ad titioners) filed a Petition to Intervene and request that the order entered in the above-referenced docket by the Commis\u00ad sion on February 4, 1977, be modified or supplemented by the issuance of an ap\u00ad propriate order pursuant to Section 202 (c) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 824a(b). Pursuant to Section 1.6 of the Commission's Rules (18 CFR 1.6), the above-mentioned Petition to Intervene has been accepted for filing as a Com\u00ad plaint. CP&L is a Texas Corporation with its principal place of business at Corpus Christi, Texas. WTU is a Texas Corpora\u00ad tion with its principal place of business at Abilene, Texas. All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of CP&L and WTU are owned by Central and South West Corporation (CSW), a Delaware Corporation with its offices in Wilming\u00ad ton, Delaware. CP&L and WTU assert that they are members of th\u00e9 Electric Reliability Coun\u00ad cil of Texas (ERCOT) and are intercon\u00adnected with each other and with certain other members of ERCOT, specifically Lower Colorado River Authority and the municipal electric utility systems of the City of Austin and the City of San An\u00ad tonio, Texas (the South Texas Govern- mentals). Petitioners contend that prior to May 4, 1976, they were also intercon\u00ad nected and operated in synchronism with the major member of ERCOT, Texas Electric Service Company, (TESCO), (and through it with the other operating subsidiaries of Texas Utilities Company (T U ): Dallas Power and Light Company (DP&L) and Texas Power & Light Com\u00ad pany (TP& L)), and were also intercon\u00ad nected with Houston Light & Power Com\u00ad pany (HL&P).. W TU states that on May 4, 1976, it commenced sales of electricity to three small communities in Oklahoma from its previously intrastate transmission lines, thus placing all ERCOT systems in inter\u00ad state commerce. Petitioners state that TESCO and HL&P responded by opening their interconnections with CP&L, WTU and the South Texas Govemmentals. On July 21, 1976, in Docket No. E-9558, the Commission entered an order authorizing emergency interconnection pursuant to Section 202(d) of the Federal Power Act. In addition, Petitioners contend that substantially all of their present electric generating facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas purchased from intra\u00ad state sources. Petitioners state that in 1976, 97.5% of the Kilowatt-hour output was generated using natural gas and the remaining 2.5% using oil. Petitioners assert that following the entry by the Commission on February 4, 1977, of its order authorizing emergency reinterconnection of ERCOT to facilitate reduction of gas consumption by ERCOT members so that gas could be diverted to interstate markets, CP&L and WTU, through C&SW's service company affili\u00ad ate, wrote a letter to HL&P and TU re\u00ad questing reinterconnection as a basis for reducing gas used to fuel spinning re\u00ad serves. In addition, Petitioners contend that they have clearly indicated their desire to make gas available to the inter\u00ad state market and are discussing arrange\u00ad ments with their respective principal gas suppliers Lo Vaca Gathering Company and Lone Star Gas Company, to trans\u00ad port diverted gas into the interstate pipeline system. Therefore, Petitioners request that the Commission enter an order under Sec\u00ad tion 202(c) of the Federal Power Act requiring the immediate resumption and continuation of all interconnected serv\u00ad ice among all of the members of ERCOT as it was on May 3, 1976, specifically re\u00ad quiring HL&P and TESCO as well as DP&L and TP&L, to restore all of the in\u00ad terconnections and services which were opened on May 4, 1976. Petitioners aver that such an order is necessary in addi\u00ad tion to, or in substitution for, the order already entered under Section 202(d) since neither TESCO nor HL&P has been willing to act under the earlier order.

(PPG ), all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Com\u00ad mission and open to public inspection. Applicant seeks authorization to trans\u00ad port up to 3,500 Mcf of natural gas per day for PPG for a primary period of two years, which gas would be received into Applicant's Lines 0-880 and FO-1633 in Valley and Center Townships. Guernsey County, Ohio, to an existing point of de\u00ad livery from Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco) to Applicant near Dranesville, Fairfax County, Vir\u00ad ginia. Transco would transport such gas to the Cities of Lexington and Shelby, North Carolina, for ultimate delivery and use by PPG's facilities in these locations. Deliveries to Transco would be accom\u00ad plished by from Transco at Dranes\u00ad ville. The application states that PPG has contracted with David S. Towner dba David S. Towner Enterprises (Towner) to purchase gas for a primary term ex\u00ad tending from the date of first delivery of such gas through April 30, 1979, at which time PPG has the option to ex\u00ad tend the contract for a two-year period and from year-to-year thereafter under terminated. It is stated that Towner has contracted to sell an average daily vol\u00ad ume of 1,500 Mcf of gas per day in the contract periods of November 1 through April 30 of each year and 1,000 Mcf per day in the contract periods of May 1 through October 31 of each year. It is further stated that Towner affirms that gas from the lease covered,by the PPGcontract has never been sold in inter\u00ad state commerce, that the gas would not be sold in the interstate market because intrastate markets are available, and that marginal gas reserves such as these cannot be developed for the regulated interstate market because of the high cost of development. The price at which PPG would purchase gas from Towner is $2.20 per Mcf from first delivery through April 30, 1977; $2.05 per Mcf from May 1 through October 31, 1977; $2.30 per Mcf from November 1, 1977, through April 30,1978. It is stated that PPG's plants in Lex\u00ad ington and Shelby make up its entire Fiber Glass Division, which accounts for approximately 40 percent of. the con\u00ad tinuous fiberglass filament produced in the United States and the gas to be transported would be used in furnace forehearths, refiners and cannals and other miscellaneous fiber \"conditioning\" equipment for which alternate fuels can\u00ad not be used since they require the con\u00ad stant flame and precise temperature control characteristics of a gaseous fuel. It is asserted that PPG employs ap\u00ad proximately 2,600 people in these two plants and is the major employers in the City of Lexington with a population of 1,350 people and in the City of Shelby with a population of 1,300 people and continued operation of these two plants is seriously threatened by present curtail\u00ad ment conditions. A shutdown of PPG's operations would have a direct economic effect on the Cities of Lexington and Shelby and ripple effects in the rest of North Carolina, it is said. Applicant states that it has available pipeline capacity, to transport the nat\u00ad ural gas without the construction of ad\u00ad ditional facilities. It is stated that Applicant's transpor\u00ad tation charge for all volumes delivered into its Line 0-890 would be its average system-wide unit storage and transmis\u00ad sion costs exclusive of company-use and unaccounted-for gas, which is currently 22.21 cents per Mcf effective November 1, 1976; for all volumes delivered into its Line FO-1633, the transportation charge would be Applicant's average systemwide unit gathering, storage and transmission costs exclusive of company-use and un\u00ad accounted-for gas, which charge cents per Mcf effective No\u00ad vember 1, 1976. Applicant would retain for company-use and unaccounted-for gas a percentage of the total volumes re\u00ad ceived for the account of PPG, which percentage is currently 3.1 percent. The transported gas is subject to diversion to Applicant in emergency periods when such gas is required for the protection of Priority 1 requirements on its system.

Take notice that on March 18, 1977, Consolidated Gas Supply Corporation (Applicant), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West Virginia 26301, filed in Docket No. CP77-201 an application pur\u00ad suant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act and Section 2.79 of the Commission's General Policy and Interpretations (18 CFR 2.79) for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the transportation of natural gas for two years for Mobay Chemical Corporation (Mobay), an existing distribution cus\u00ad tomer of Applicant's Hope Natural Gas Company division (Hope), all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to pub\u00ad lic inspection. Applicant proposes to transport for Mobay up to 2,000 Mcf of gas per day for two years for use at Mobay's New Martinsville, West Virginia, chemical plant. The natural gas proposed to be transported would be received by Appli\u00ad cant into its existing Line Nos. 3, 4, and 106 in Wetzel c/ounty, West Virginia, and for delivery by Applicant into the distribution facilities of Hope, for Mo\u00ad bay's account at an existing point of delivery in Wetzel County, West Virginia. It is stated that Hope is Mobay's sole gas supplier, that Hope curtailed deliver\u00ad ies to Mobay to the minimum level suf\u00ad ficient to protect property from Jan\u00ad uary 16, 1977, to February 9, 1977, and that deliveries are currently being cur\u00ad tailed by 20 percent of Mobay's priority 2 requirements. Deliveries of Mobay's priority 5 boiler fuel gas have been com\u00ad pletely curtailed since 1975, it is said. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17904 NOTICES Applicant states it filed a telegraphic request for temporary emergency au\u00ad thorization for the transportation of natural gas for Mobay on February 11, 1977, and was granted a temporary cer\u00ad tificate by the Commission on February 16, 1977. It is stated that Mobay's New Martins\u00ad ville plant employs approximately 850 persons and is one of the largest employ\u00ad ers in the New Martinsville area. Mobay produces, among other things, polyure\u00ad thane chemicals, plastics, and coating materials at the New Martinsville plant, which products are used in the manu\u00ad facture of home and industrial insula\u00ad tion products, automobiles, and furni\u00ad ture, it is said. It is further stated that Mobay intends to use the volumes pro\u00ad posed to be transported for priority 2 process or feedstock uses in its reformer, sulphuric acid concentration and envi\u00ad ronmental control facilities. The re\u00ad former facility, which consumes approxi\u00ad mately 90 percent of the gas proposed to be transported requires gaseous fuel as feedstock to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which are essential in the operation of Mobay's TDI unit, it is said. Applicant states that continued insuffi\u00ad cient gas supplies would result in short\u00ad ages of critical materials, as well as the layoff of part or all of Mobay's work force, which layoffs would adversely af\u00ad fect the economic situation in that area. Applicant states that it would charge Mobay 8.92 cents per Mcf for this trans\u00ad portation service 1 and would retain 4 percent of the gas to provide the service. The gas to be transported would be pro\u00ad duced by Mobay from its own wells lo\u00ad cated in Wetzel County, West Virginia, and has never been sold in interstate commerce, the application states. It is further stated that Applicant has available pipeline capacity to perform the proposed transportation service without the construction of additional facilities. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before April 11, 1977, file with the Federal Power Commission, Washington, D.C. 20460, a petition to intervene or a protest in ac\u00ad cordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Pro\u00ad cedure (18 CFR 1.8 or 1.10) and the Reg\u00ad ulations under the Natural Gras Act (18 CFR 157.10).

The contract also included a FPC area rate clause which allowed the seller to collect any Commission established area rate applicable to the premises which was higher than the 35 cents/Mcf (with es\u00ad calation) rate mentioned above. Under the area rate clause, seller could collect the higher applicable area rate for the first year following the establishment of such area rate and annual escalations of 0.5 cents/Mcf each year thereafter. By an amendatory agreement dated October 7, 1976 Sea Robin (United's successor-in-interest to the Febru\u00ad ary 1, 1972 contract, by virtue of a Feb\u00ad ruary 1, 1972 assignment) agreed to pay Mesa Offshore any price authorized by a final Commission order pursuant to the Commission's special relief regulations (18 CFR 2.56a(g) ; 2.76) for the Vermil\u00ad ion 228 and Eugene Island 256 gas. As was mentioned above, Offshore, on No\u00ad vember 22, 1976 petitioned the Commis\u00ad sion under Section 2.56a(g) for a special relief rate of $3.07/Mcf for its gas inter\u00ad ests in the subject two blocks. Without special relief, Offshore is entitled to the base rates established in Opinion No. 770-A, namely 93 cents/Mcf or 1.43/Mcf depending on the particular well com\u00ad mencement dates involved. Offshore al\u00ad leges that \"its costs of producing all of the gas attributable to its interests in the two Blocks covered by this Petition is approximately $3.07 per Mcf * * *\" (Petition at 2). It estimates that its \"proved, probable and possible equivalent gas reserves\" in the two Blocks \"amounts to 45,800 MMcf\". (Ibid.) AH of the five above-mentioned blocks involved in the February 1, 1972 con\u00ad tract were acquired by Mesa in the De\u00ad cember 15, 1970 Outer Continental Shelf (\"OCS\" ) Lease Sale. The primary lease term of five years from the effective date of the lease within which to develop and produce the properties expired on Feb\u00ad ruary 1, 1976 for Eugene Island 256, Ver\u00ad milion 228 and East Cameron 199. Ex- tentions of the lease term beyond the primary 5 year term in the absence or 4, 1977 17906 cessation of production can be granted by a USGS supervisor in accordance with the pertinent regulations, particularly 30 CPR 250.1 et seq and OCS Order No. 4. Mesa has not included into one project all of the leases it acquired at the Decem\u00ad ber, 1970 OCS Lease Sale. There is a question as to whether the instant Peti\u00ad tion for special relief is based upon one or more projects. Offshore does not allege in its Petition that the blocks herein have either geographical or geological coher\u00ad ence nor that these blocks were all the blocks it acquired at a single Outer Con\u00ad tinental Shelf Lease Sale. In fact the distance between Eugene Island 256 and Vermilion 228 is approximately 60 linear miles. Accordingly, the Commis\u00ad sion Staff is directed to examine those Blocks Mesa purchased at the Outer Continental Shelf Lease Sales in 1970, 1972 and 1973 in which its working in\u00ad terest was at least 5 percent. And the Commission directs Petitioner to submit evidence of gas supply and cost data for each of the instant blocks individually. Petitioner may also submit evidence sup\u00ad porting its view that the blocks should be treated as a single project. Petitioner shall fully explain why these blocks were included in the present Petition and other, as yet un certificated blocks that they acquired in the 1970, 1972 and 1973 OCS Lease Sales were not so included. In their Petition for special relief, Petitioner states its willingness \"to ac\u00ad cept the applicable Opinion No. 770-A National Rate\" pending approval of its special relief rate in the event Sea Robin is willing and able to take deliveries, \"provided such Petition will be acted upon by the Commission within 7 months\" of the filing date [Petition at 3]. Petitioner also requests that this filing be consolidated with that of Pennzoil Offshore Gas Operators, Inc. in Docket No. CI76-806. The delivery points for the gas herein involved are to be on the offshore produc\u00ad tion platforms at Eugene Island 256 and Vermilion 228. Petitioner's present own\u00ad ership interest in Eugene Island 256 is 16.77% and it now owns 43.285% of Ver\u00ad milion 228. It estimates that sales vol\u00ad umes from its interests in the two blocks will be 540,830 Mcf/month equally about 6,489,960 Mcf/year. Mesa Petroleum Company, Incor- rated in Delaware in 1964, formed Mesa Offshore Co. in 1971. Offshore is one of Mesa's seven wholly-owned subsidiaries. In addition, Mesa has interests in 2 other companies, General American Oil Com\u00ad pany of Texas and Sunlite Oil Co., Ltd. As of December 31, 1975, Mesa had 7,365,563 Gross Acres of undeveloped acreage including leases, drilling permits and petroleum and natural gas reserva\u00ad tions. In December, 1976 it had agreed to purchase McMoRan Exploration Com\u00ad pany's interests in 6 Federal offshore Louisiana blocks and one Federal off\u00ad shore Texas block, subject to certain clos\u00ad ing conditions. An examination of the Petition for Special Relief and the data submitted in support thereof raises a question as to whether there is sufficient basis for the Commission to find the proposed rateNOTICES to be just and reasonable. Therefore, we deem it necessary that a hearing be held in this matter to help determine answers to all of the issues raised. The Commission finds: (1) It is necessary and in the public interest that the above-docketed proceed\u00ad ing be set for hearing. (2) It is necessary and in the public interest that the above-docketed pro\u00ad ceeding (RI77-13) be consolidated with that of Pennzoil Offshore Gas Operators, Inc. in Docket No. CI76-806. The Commission orders: (A) Pursuant to the authority of the Natural Gas Act, particularly sections 4, 5, 7, 14 and 16 thereof, the Commission's rules of practice and procedure, and the regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR Chapter I ) , a public hearing in Docket No. RI77-13 shall be held in a hearing room of the Federal Power Com\u00ad mission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washintgon, D.C. 20426 for the purpose of hearing and disposition of the issues in this proceeding. (B) The proceeding in the instant docket is hereby and hereafter consoli\u00ad dated for all purposes with the proceed\u00ad ing in Docket No. CI76-806. (C) A Presiding Administrative Law Judge to be designated by the Chief Ad\u00ad ministrative Law Judge for that purpose (see Delegation of Authority, 18 CFR 3.5(d )) shall preside at the hearing in this proceeding, with authority to es\u00ad tablish and change all procedural dates, and to rule on all motions (with the ex\u00ad ception of petitions to intervene, mo\u00ad tions to consolidate and sever, and mo\u00ad tions to dismiss, as provided for in the Rules of Practice and Procedure). (D) Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to this consolidated proceeding should, on or before April 12, 1977, file with the Federal Power Commission, at the ad\u00ad dress stated in Ordering Paragraph (A), a petition to intervene or a protest in ac\u00ad cordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Pro\u00ad cedure (18 CFR 1.8 or 1.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be con\u00ad sidered by it in determining the appro\u00ad priate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to this proceeding, or to participate as a party in any hearing herein, must file a petition to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. (E) The interventions granted in Or\u00ad dering Paragraph (G) of the Order Set\u00ad ting Proceeding For Hearing And Grant\u00ad ing Interventions, in Docket No. CI76- 806, issued March 11, 1977 are hereby and hereafter granted intervention in this consolidated proceeding under the same terms and conditions stated in the aforementioned Ordering Paragraph (G ). (F) Pursuant to \u00a7 1.8 of the Commis\u00ad sion's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 1.8), the Presiding Administra\u00ad tive Law Judge is hereby authorized to permit the participation at the pre- hearing conference or hearing of any party that has filed a petition to inter-vene pursuant to Ordering Paragraph (D) that has not been acted upon by the Commission. (G) Petitioner and any intervenor supporting the Petition for special relief shall file their direct testimony and evi\u00ad dence on or before April 12, 1977. All testimony and evidence shall be served upon the Presiding Administrative Law Judge, the Commission Staff, and all parties to this proceeding. Petitioner shall submit gas supply and cost data for each block individually. Petitioner may submit evidence supporting its view that the blocks should be treated as a single project. Mesa shall submit evi\u00ad dence as to why these blocks were in\u00ad cluded in this Petition and others that they acquired in the 1970, 1972 and 1973 OCS Lease Sales were excluded. Peti\u00ad tioner shall file not only opinion evi\u00ad dence on the costs and the gas supply issues but also sufficient underlying data so that the reasonableness and credibil\u00ad ity of the opinion evidence can be weighed by application of traditional evidentiary standards. The aforemen\u00ad tioned list of evidence is not intended to foreclose data, testimony, or other evi\u00ad dence not specifically enumerated from being brought within this proceeding. All relevant and material evidence shall be admissible. (H) The Commission staff shall ex\u00ad amine, and copy where appropriate, the records, accounts and memoranda of Mesa pertaining to its blocks purchased in the Outer Continental Shelf Lease Sales held in 1970, 1972, and 1973 in which it held a working interest of at least 5 percent. (I) The Presiding Judge shall preside at a pre-hearing conference to be held in this consolidated proceeding on April 29, 1977 at 10 a.m. e.s.t. in a hearing room at the address noted in Ordering Paragraph (A ). (J) Upon completion of the necessary pipeline connections Petitioner is hereby authorized to commence deliveries to Sea Robin and receive the applicable na\u00ad tional rate for such gas sales, in ac\u00ad cordance with the terms of Opinion No. 770-A. Within 10 days of commencement of any deliveries under this Ordering Paragraph, Offshore shall so notify the Commission. By the Commission. Kenneth F. Plumb , Secretary.

On March 3,1975, Nevada Power Com\u00ad pany (Nevada) tendered for filing a notice of cancellation of wholesale serv\u00ad ice to California-Pacific Utilities Com\u00ad pany (Cal-Pac) at Henderson, Nevada, to becqme effective as of June 1, 1975. In its notice of cancellation, Nevada stated that the reason for termination is its FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 NOTICES 17907 inability to attract capital to support its sales to Cal-Pac at Henderson. Notice of the March 3, 1975, filing was issued on March 18,1975, with comments, protests or petitions to intervene due on or before May 1,1975. Subsequently, Cal- Pac filed a motion to intervene within the prescribed period. Cal-Pac resisted the notice of cancellation of service at Hen\u00ad derson, Nevada and moved that Nevada's tendered filing of March 18, 1975, be re\u00ad jected for not conforming with the terms of \u00a7 35.15 of the Commission's Regula\u00ad tions under the Federal Power Act. The Initial Decision of Administrative Law Judge Curtis L. Wagner, Jr., in Docket No. E-9306, rendered December 1 5 , 1976, permits Nevada to terminate service to Cal-Pac. On January 11, 1977, Cal-Pac, by letter, requested an exten\u00ad sion until January 21, 1977 for filing briefs on exceptions. This extension was granted by notice issued January 17, 1977. On January 18, 1977, North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation (N.C. EMC) and Four County Electric Mem\u00ad bership Corporation (Four County EMC) filed a motion for Allowance of Untimely Petition to Intervene, For Acceptance of Brief on Exceptions or, in the Alterna\u00ad tive, For Acceptance of Brief on Excep\u00ad tions as Amicus. N.C. EMC and Four County EMC receive most of their power at wholesale in transactions governed by the Federal Power Act, and therefore seek to intervene in order to protect their interests and the interests of N.C. EMC's distribution member systems. By order issued February 9, 1977, the Commission denied N.C. EMC and Four County EMC's petition to intervene out of time, but accepted its Brief on Exceptions' as amicus curiae. On February 11, 1977, N.C. EMC and Four County EMC filed a motion for ac\u00ad ceptance of its Brief Opposing Excep\u00ad tions or, in the Alternative, for Ac\u00ad ceptance of its Brief Opposing Excep\u00ad tions as amicus curiae. For the reasons set forth in the Commission's order of February 9, 1977, we accept N.C. EMC and Four County EMC's Brief Opposing Exceptions as amicus curiae. On March 1,1977, the American Public Power Association (APPA) filed a Brief on Exceptions as amicus curiae pursuant to the Commission's Rules and Regula\u00ad tions, 18 CFR 1.31. On March 4, 1977, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) joined in the APPA brief.

Many members of APPA and NRECA purchase all or part of their electric power requirements at wholesale from public utilities subject to regula\u00ad tion by the Federal Power Commission. We find that it may be in the public Interest to accept the APPA's brief on ex\u00ad ceptions and we will allow Nevada four- brief **ayS ^ to respond to theThe Commission finds: (1) Good cause exists to accept N.C.

[PR Doc.77-9946 Filed 4-l-77;8:45 amj [Docket No. CP77-288] NORTHERN UTILITIES, INC. Notice of Application March 29, 1977. Take notice that on March 9, 1977, Northern Utilities, Inc. (Applicant), 1075 Forest Avenue, Portland, Maine 04103, filed in Docket No. CP77-288 an applica\u00ad tion pursuant to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act for authorization to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Montreal, Canada to Lewiston, Maine, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Applicant states that it has entered into an agreement with Gaz Metropoli\u00ad tan, Inc. (Gaz Metro) for the purchase of 100,000 Mcf vaporous equivalent .of LNG for delivery during November and December, 1977, which it proposes to take delivery of at Gaz Metro's storage tanks in Montreal, Canada and to transport to its facilities at Lewiston, Maine, via cryogenic semi-trailer tanker trucks which it would supply. It is stated that Applicant and Gaz Metro have agreed upon a price of $2.80 per Mcf vaporous equivalent of LNG sold during November, 1977, and $3.25 per Mcf for volumes sold during December, 1977, and that these prices are subject to any gas cost increases approved by the Canadian National Energy Board. It is further stated that Applicant may take delivery of a portion of the 100,000 Mcf prior to November 1, 1977, dependent upon availability by Gaz Metro. It is asserted that Applicant utilizes LNG for peak shaving, and to maintain service to its distribution customers dur\u00ad ing periods of curtailment of its natural gas supply; that Applicant obtains its en\u00ad tire natural gas supply from its wholly- owned subsidiary, Granite State GasTransmission, Inc. (Granite State), which in turn receives its entire gas sup\u00ad ply from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Com\u00ad pany, a Division of Tenneco Inc. (Ten\u00ad nessee) at Haverhill, Massachusetts. It is further asserted that Tennessee is currently curtailing service to its cus\u00ad tomers; the curtailments which Granite State experiences from Tennessee are passed on to Applicant, necessitating Ap\u00ad plicant's requirements for supplemental LNG supplies. Applicant further asserts that the lo\u00ad cation on the LNG storage and supply facility at the terminus of its system in Maine is an important safety factor in maintaining service to both the Portland and the Lewiston/Auburn markets in the event of an outage on Applicant's line in Maine or in the event of further extreme curtailments from Tennessee. Applicant states that in the past, it purchased LNG from New England dis\u00ad tributors whieh have LNG liquefaction capability and had excess LNG beyond their own immediate market require\u00ad ments, but these purchases have been somewhat inflexible, being limited to sin\u00ad gle 60-day periods in the wintertime, and truck deliveries due to wintertime road meeting scheduled delivery dates. Appli\u00ad cant further states that it may request deliveries of a portion of its contract volume prior to November 1, 1977, which it desires to avail itself of because cryo\u00ad genic tank trucks are less in demand dur\u00ad ing the off-season and road conditions are better, allowing more precise sched\u00ad uling of deliveries. It is stated that the prices per Mcf for LNG deliveries in November and December, 1977 as specified are less than what Applicant has paid for LNG sup\u00ad plies during the 1976-77 winter and probably less than what it could expect to pay for LNG supplies next winter from U.S. suppliers. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to to said application should on or be\u00ad fore April 16, 1977, file with the Federal Power Commission, Washington, D.C, 20426, a petition to intervene or a pro\u00ad test in accordance with the require\u00ad ments of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 1.8 or 1.10).

Request for Permission To Negotiate With Underwriters for the Issue and Sale of Securities March 29,1977. Take notice that on March 14, 1977, Pacific Power & Light Company (Pacific),a Maine corporation, qualified to trans\u00ad act business in the states of Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, California, Mon\u00ad tana and Idaho, with its principal busi\u00ad ness office at Portland, Oregon, filed a request with the Federal Power Com\u00ad mission (Commission) seeking permis\u00ad sion to negotiate with underwriters for the issue and sale of securities. Pacific states that it plans to issue in early May, 1977, up to $40,000,000 in principal amount of its Serial Preferred Stock in the form of either up to 1,600,000 shares of its No Par Serial Preferred Stock with a $25 stated value or up to 400,000 shares of its $100 Par Serial Preferred Stock (Securities). It is anticipated that proceeds from the sale of the Securities Will be used to retire outstanding short\u00ad term indebtedness issued to temporarily finance part of the Company's 1977 con\u00ad struction program. Pacific states that at this time it ap\u00ad plies for permission to negotiate with the underwriters with respect to terms on which the Securities might be issued in order to determine whether applica\u00ad tion for exemption from the competitive bidding requirements of Section 34.1a of Federal Power Commission Regulations should be made. Pacific states that it has\" not engaged in any negotiations for the sale or underwriting of the Securities, and will not do so prior to the Commis\u00ad sion's granting of this request for per\u00ad mission to negotiate. Pacific states that although it supports competitive bidding of debt and common issues during receptive markets, in the case of preferred stocks, it would like to have as an alternative the ability to seek to sell the Securities through negotia\u00ad tion in the event that market conditions require such a procedure for Pacific to obtain the lowest dividend cost. For the foregoing reasons, therefore, Pacific re\u00ad spectfully requests that the Commission grant it permission to engage in prelim\u00ad inary negotiations with underwriters in order to determine if exemption from the Commission's competitive bidding re\u00ad quirements should be sought. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to. the request should on or before April 8,1977, file with the Federal Power Commission, Washington, D.C., 20426, petitions or protests in accordance with the Commis\u00ad sion's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 1.8,1.10).

Take notice that on March 11, 1977, Southern Transmission Corporation (Applicant), 1114 Avenue of the Ameri\u00ad cas, New York, N.Y. 10036, filed in Docket No. CP76-314 the second supple\u00ad ment to its application filed in said docket pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of pub\u00ad lic convenience and necessity by which supplement Applicant sets forth that agreements have been negotiated be\u00ad tween Memphis Light, Gas and Water City of Memphis, Tennessee, uvllg &W) , Applicant and W. R. Grace & co. (Grace), Applicant's parent, as a result of which MLG&W's objection to me pipeline proposed herein has been al1 as more fully set forth in the ement on Ale with the Commission d open to public inspection. m Tio ^ Upf lement states that on March Applicant filed in the instant tUwnt ^pplication pursuant to Sec- cerHfWf \u00b0f * the Natural Gas Act for a necpSi+,te \u00b0 LpubIic convenience and and n n l auth\u00b0rizing the construction of R5/Pfvfau1 < ^ of its prop\u00b0sed 148 miles tion ? 'D' Pipeline from the loca- certain natural gas reservesowned by Grace in Monroe County, Mississippi to the anhydrous ammonia and urea fertilizer plant (Grace Plant) owned by Grace located approximately 12 miles north of Memphis in Shelby County, Tennessee. It is stated that on April 21, 1976, MLG&W filed a petition to intervene in this proceeding which states although it has been the sole supplier of gas to the Grace Plant, it would be unable for the foreseeable future to meet Grace's re\u00ad quirements, but it has a policy of cooper\u00ad ation with its industrial customers in any attempts to obtain additional sup\u00ad plies of natural gas. However, MLG&W stated that \"it objected to the construc\u00ad tion of a gas pipeline within its \" * * service area, which consists of Shelby County, Tennessee.\" The petition states that MLG&W expressed its willingness to provide transportation service for Grace \" * * * from a point on the boundary of Shelby County to the Grace plant north of the City of Mexico.\" It is indicated that on August 24, 1976, Applicant filed with the Commission a Supplement to the application in which it submitted responses to requests of the Secretary of the Commission dated May 28, 1976, and July 6, 1976, for additional information. Notice of a conference was issued on December 6, 1976, to attempt to resolve any and all questions presented by the application, the Secretary's letters of May 28 and July 6, 1976, and the pe\u00ad titions to intervene. An affidavit was sub\u00ad mitted by Southern Transmission which concluded that '* * * * it is apparent that a satisfactory long-term firm agree\u00ad ment cannot be worked out with existing pipelines which would assure the con\u00ad tinued operation of the Grace anhydrous ammonia and urea plant.\" In the instant supplement Applicant states that on January 11, 1977, a con\u00ad ference was held and attended by rep\u00ad resentatives of the various parties. A rep\u00ad resentative of Texas Eastern Gas Pipe\u00ad line Company (Texas Eastern) stated that Texas Eastern could offer Grace only short-term interruptible transpor\u00ad tation service. At the conference, Staff requested that a revised transportation tariff be filed. It is indicated that several agreements were entered into, of which, the \"Pipe\u00ad line Agreement\" contains the overall agreement reached between MLG&W and Applicant and incorporates as a part of such contract the \"Construction Agree\u00ad ment,\" the tuity.\" Applicant states that the agreement provides that: MLG&W would support Applicant in its efforts to obtain expedi\u00ad tiously such Federal Power Commission authorizations as may be required for the construction and operation of the pro\u00ad posed pipeline during the term of the agreement and would withdraw its op\u00ad position to the application in this pro\u00ad ceeding; MLG&W would design and con\u00ad struct for Applicant the 37-mile segment of the proposed pipeline to be located in Shelby County, Tennessee, referred to in the agreement as \" Shelby Pipeline;\" MLG&W would operate and maintainShelby Pipeline; MLG&W would locate the Shelby Pipeline within MLG&W's utility easements and grant to Applicant all required -easement rights; and MLG&W is granted the option upon the expiration of a 20-year period, to pur\u00ad chase the Shelby Pipeline and the related easements which Applicant obtained from MLG&W. It is indicated that these changes do not alter the objective of the original application. Applicant states that the very minor change in the route of the line at the northwestern end is to pro\u00ad vide that all of the Tennessee segment would be located in Shelby County. It is stated that the benefits flowing from this change are that the entire Shelby Pipe\u00ad line would be located within utility ease\u00ad ments now owned by MLG&W plus a short five-mile utility easement to be ac\u00ad quired by MLG&W. In the instant supplement Applicant states that the effect of the agreements upon the cost of getting the gas through Shelby County, to the Grace Plant is difficult to evaluate. It is said that the Pipeline Operating Contract provides, in general, that Applicant shall pay to MLG&W $91,000 per year, subject to escalations after the first three calendar years of operation, and each succeeding three year period, tied into the actual cost experienced by MLG&W and as related to certain Federal Government price indices. The supplement further states that it is impracticable to estimate with any reasonable degree of accuracy what the effect would be upon the estimates of revenues, expenses and in\u00ad come, but, it is believed that it would be negligible. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said supplement should on or before April 15, 1977, file with the Federal Power Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a petition to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 1.8 or 1.10) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the Protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a petition to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

AEP states that the letter of agree\u00ad ment provides for a minimum energy charge for Emergency Service of \"three ($0.03) cents\" per kilowatt-hour, pro\u00ad posed to become effective May 1, 1977. A similar letter agreement between Illi\u00ad nois Power Company and I&M was sub\u00ad mitted to the Commission as a proposed settlement of FPC Docket No. ER76-21 and on September 8, 1976 the Commis\u00ad sion issued an order approving this settlement making it effective as of March 2,1976.

Texas Gas, as agent, executed a con\u00ad tract on February 5, 1977, with National Exploration Company (National) for the purchase of approximately 1,000 Mcfd from the South Roanoke Field, Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana. The total price \u00bbThese customers are local distribution companies and interstate pipelines as de\u00ad fined in \u00a7\u00a72(1),(5) of the Act (91 Stat. 4).to be paid by Texas Gas, as agent, is $2.25 per MMBtu. Thus, the proposed price is fair and equitable in accordance with Order No. 2. Texas Gas will construct a meter sta\u00ad tion, side valve and related facilities ad\u00ad jacent to Texas Gas' pipeline in Jeffer\u00ad son Davis Parish, Jjouisiana, at an esti\u00ad mated cost of $9,500. These costs will be paid on a pro-rata basis by Texas Gas' customers which receive these volumes. In addition, Texas Gas' proposed trans\u00ad portation rates are based upon the cost data supporting the settlement rates in Texas Gas' most recent Federal Power Commission rate case in Docket No. RP76-17 and the retention of a percent of the transported volumes for compres\u00ad sor fuel and company use and loss. I find no basis on which to fix other charges since the parties have agreed upon the transportation charges and payment of the construction costs. Based upon the foregoing, Texas Gas is authorized to purchase gas-, as'agent, from National, to construct facilities to receive such gas and to transport such gas for certain of its customers. This au\u00ad thorization is conditioned on (i) Texas Gas' submission of the names of the cus\u00ad tomers for which it is acting as agent, (ii) those customers agreeing to submit reports as required by Order No. 4 and (iii) such customers certifying that they are entitled to purchase gas under the provisions of Order No. 6.

L. 95-2 (91 Stat* 4 (1977) ), a request for an order authorizing certain emergency purchases of natural gas for which Ten\u00ad nessee had entered into an oral agree\u00ad ment on or prior to March 3, 1977.Ten\u00ad nessee furnished additional information with respect to some of the proposed purchases in a supplemental filing on March 29,1977. For the reasons set forth below, I grant in part and deny in part Tennessee's application. Tennessee is currently serving uses of natural gas classified in Federal Power Commission (FPC) Priorities 4 through 9 (18 CFR 2.78 (a) (1) (iv )-(ix )). Thus, under Order No. 6 (February 22, 1977), Tennessee is not eligible to make these proposed purchases unless it can satisfy the criteria of \"Colorado Interstate Gas Company,\" Docket No. E77-31 (February 28, 1977). \"Transwestem Pipeline Com\u00ad pany,\" Docket No. E77-79 (March 28, 1977). \"El Paso Natural Gas Company,\" Docket No. E77-53 (March 10, 1977); \"Northern Natural Gas Company,\" Docket No. E77-49 (March 7, 1977); \"Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America,\" Docket No. E77-48 (March 4, 1977); \"United Gas Pipe Line Company,\" Docket No. E77-33 (March 2, 1977). Whether Tennessee has satisfied the \"Colorado Interstate\" criteria is to be determined at the time Tennessee de\u00ad termined that it was serving directly or indirectly any uses classified in Priori\u00ad ties 4 24,1977). According to Tennessee's filing, it first learned on March 3,1977, that certain of its customers were serving uses specified in Priorities 4 through 9. Tennessee's pe\u00ad titions indicate that only the proposed purchase from Texaco Inc. (Texaco) at the Roma Field, Starr County, Texas, satisfies the \"Colorado Interstate\" cri\u00ad teria. I will therefore approve this pro\u00ad posed sale. The other proposed purchases do not satisfy the \"Colorado Interstate\" criteria, and Tennessee is not eligible to make these purchases under Order No. 6. Tennessee will purchase approximately 800 to 1000 Mcfd from Texaco at a price of $2.25 per MMBtu. This price is fair and equitable in accordance with Order No. 2. Texaco will deliver this gas to Gii & Development Corporatio Gmf Energy) which will deliver the gs jo Tennessee.

On March 25, 1977, as supplemented by petition submitted on March 28, 1977, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) filed, pursuant to section 6 of the Emergency Natural Gas Act of 1977 (Act), Pub. L. 95-2 (91 Stat. 4 (1977) ), an application for authorization to (i) divert gas purchased from Delhi Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Delhi) under the March 1 , 1977 authorization in this proceeding to Pacific Lighting Service Company (Pacific) and Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E), (ii) have such gas transported by El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), and (iii) amend the March 1, 1977 authorization to per\u00ad mit Columbia to purchase up to an aver\u00ad age of 60,000 Mcfd from the commence\u00ad ment of deliveries through July 31, 1977. Columbia proposes these changes to per\u00ad mit it to use the subject volumes to sat\u00ad isfy its repayment obligations to Pacific and PG&E and the repayment obligation of the Columbia Distribution Companies (Columbia Distribution ).1 These obliga\u00ad tions total approximately 5.095 Bcf .2 For 1 Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Colum\u00ad bia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia Gas of New York, Inc., Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc., Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc., Colum\u00ad bia Gas of Virginia, Inc. and Columbia Gas of West Virginia, Inc.

Columbia Distribution acquired ap\u00ad proximately 1.029 Bcf from Pacific in Docket No. E77-30.the reasons set forth below, I grant Co\u00ad lumbia's petition for a supplemental order. Columbia states that it will make vol\u00ad umes from Delhi available to Columbia Distribution to permit Columbia Distri\u00ad bution to satisfy its repayment obliga\u00ad tion. Columbia Distribution will pay Co\u00ad lumbia $2.25 per MMBtu for all Delhi volumes used to satisfy its repayment obligation and a proportional share of all ti ansportation charges. Columbia will divert the Delhi volumes to Pacific and PG&E until all repayment obligation is satisfied and will then resume the trans\u00ad portation of the Delhi volumes to its system. Columbia further states that it is able to divert the Delhi volumes be\u00ad cause of other purchases under the Act and warm weather in the areas served by its system which have resulted in sig\u00ad nificant improvement in its storage inventory. Delhi will deliver these volumes to El Paso for Columbia's account in Pecos County, Texas. El Paso will transport and deliver the appropriate volumes to Pacific and PG&E at existing delivery points on the Arizona-California border. El Paso will charge 1.0 cent per Mcf de\u00ad livered plus 5 percent of the volumes re\u00ad ceived from Delhi for shrinkage. Since the parties have agreed to the transpor\u00ad tation charges to be paid, I find no basis for prescribing other charges. Columbia also requests that the March 1, 1977 authorization which authorized purchases up to 60,000 Mcfd, be amended to authorize purchases up to an average of 60,000 Mcfd. Columbia states that Delhi has been unable to deliver the full 60,000 Mcfd on many days because of other systems demands and that Delhi has agreed to deliver volumes in excess of 60,000 Mcfd on certain days so that volumes for the remaining term will aver\u00ad age 60,000 Mcfd. Pursuant to section 6(a) (1) of the Act, I authorize Columbia to divert volumes purchased from Delhi to Pacific and PG&E to satisfy Columbia's and Colum\u00ad bia Distribution's repayment obligations to such companies and Columbia Distri\u00ad bution to reimburse Columbia for all Delhi volumes used to satisfy Columbia Distribution's repayment obligation. Pur\u00ad suant to section 6(c) (1) of the Act, I authorize El Paso to receive volumes from Delhi for transportation and deliv\u00ad ery to Pacific and PG&E for the account of Columbia and Columbia Distribution. Such transportation and delivery shall be on the terms and at the charges agreed to by the parties. The March 1, 1977 authorizaton in this proceeding is further amended to authorize Delhi to deliver up to an average of 60,000 Mcfd of natural gas from the date of this order through July 31, 1977.

Prior Certification Pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Tax Act of 1976 Helmerich and Payne, Inc., Tulsa, Oklahoma (\"H&P\" ) has requested a prior certification pursuant to section 1101(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\" ), as amended by section 2 (a,) of the Bank Holding Company Tax Act of 1976, that its proposed divestiture of substantially all of the 85,510 shares of Utica Bankshares Corporation, Tulsa, Oklahoma (\"Bankshares\" ) , presently held by H&P, through the pro rata dis\u00ad tribution of such shares to the common shareholders of H&P, is necessary or ap\u00ad propriate to effecutate the policies of the Bank Holding (12 U.S.C. 1841 et seq.) (\"BHC Act\" ). H&P proposes to distribute to its shareholders one share of Bankshares for each 50 shares of H&P held by such shareholders. H&P shareholders who would be entitled to fractional interests in Bankshares will receive cash in lieu of such frac\u00ad tional interests. H&P anticipates that be\u00ad cause it will not distribute fractional shares, it will, after the distribution, re\u00ad main in possession of approximately 0.6 per cent of the total outstanding shares of Bankshares. In connection with this request, the following information is deemed rele\u00ad vant, for purposes of issuing the request\u00ad ed certification : 1 1. H&P is a corporation organized un\u00ad der the laws of the State of Delaware on February 3,1940. 2. On July 7, 1970, H&P controlled 36.6 percent of the outstanding voting shares of Utica National Bank and Trust Com\u00ad pany, Tulsa, Oklahoma (\"Bank\" ) . 3. H&P became a bank holding com\u00ad pany on December 31, 1970, as a result of the 1970 Amendments to the BHC Act, by virtue of its control at that time of more than 25 percent of the outstanding voting shares of Bank, and it registered as such with the Board in August 1971. 4. H&P holds property acquired by it on or before July 7, 1970, the disposition of which would be necessary or appro\u00ad priate to effectuate section 4 of the BHC Act if H&P were to continue to be a bank holding company beyond December 31, 1 This information derives from H&P's cor\u00ad respondence with the Board concerning its request for this certification, H&P's Regis\u00ad tration Statement filed with-the Board pur\u00ad suant to the BHC Act, and other records of the Board.1980, which property is \" prohibited prop\u00ad erty\" within the meaning of section 1103 (c) of the Code. 5. On or about February 1, 1974, H&P sold 12,500 shares of voting stock of Bank, thereby reducing to approximately 23 per cent of Bank's outstanding voting stock the number of shares of such stock controlled by H&P. Subsequent to that date, H&P requested a determination by the Board that it was no longer a bank holding company. However, on July 11, 1974, H&P was advised that the Legal Division of the Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of ^Kansas City had con\u00ad cluded that H&P had not established that it no longer controlled or exercised a controlling influence over the manage\u00ad ment or policies of Bank. This conclusion was based in part upon the fact that H&P still held approximately 23 per cent of the voting shares of Bank; that three persons who were officers or directors of H&P served as directors of Bank; and that no other individual or organization controlled more than 9 per cent of Bank's voting stock .2 6. H&P has, continuously since its reg\u00ad istration as a bank holding company, re\u00ad mained subject to the BHC Act and has conducted its affairs as a bank holding company. Specifically, on January 14, 1975, it filed with the Board, and the Board accepted, an irrevocable declara\u00ad tion, pursuant to \u00a7 225.4(d) of the Board's Regulation Y, that it will cease to be a bank holding company by Janu\u00ad ary 1, 1981; on March 3, 1975, the Board approved an application filed by H&P as a bank holding company pursuant to sec\u00ad tion 3(a) (3) of the BHC Act to acquire control of 22.2 per cent of the voting shares of Bankshares in connection with the reorganization of Bank into a wholly- owned subsidiary of Bankshares; and during 1975 and 1976 H&P filed with the Board all of the reports required of it under the BHC Act. 7. H&P has indicated that it will ter\u00ad minate all interlocking relationships be\u00ad tween H&P and its subsidiaries, on one hand, and Bankshares and its subsidi\u00ad aries, including Bank, on the other hand, within six months following the distribu\u00ad tion of H&P's shares of Bankshares.- On the basis of the foregoing informa\u00ad tion, it is hereby certified that: (A) H&P is a qualified bank holding corporation, within the meaning of sub\u00ad section (b) of section 1103 of the Code, and satisfies the requirements of that subsection; (B) the shares of Bankshares that H&P proposes to distribute to its share\u00ad holders are all or part of the property by reason of which H&P controls (within the meaning of \u00a7 2(a) of the BHC Act) a bank or bank holding company; and (C) the distribution of such shares is necessary or appropriate to effectuate the policies of the BHC Act.

Order Approving Formation of a Bank Holding Company and Acquisition of Two Bank Holding Companies In the matter of the Jacobus Com\u00ad pany, Inland Heritage Corporation and inland Beloit Corporation. The Jacobus Company, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, and its 45.4 per cent owned subsidiary, Inland Heritage Corpora\u00ad tion, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin (herein- inafter jointly referred to as \"Appli\u00ad cant\" ), both of which are bank holding companies within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, have ap\u00ad plied for the Board's approval under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842) to acquire all of the voting shares of Financial Network Corporation (\"FNC\" ) , a one-bank hold\u00ad ing company that owns 95.4 per cent of the voting shares of The Beloit State Bank (\"Beloit Bank\" ), and to acquire all the voting shares of Community Holding Corporation (\"CHC\" ), a one- bank holding company that owns 75.3 per cent of the voting shares of Commu\u00ad nity Bank of Beloit (\"Community Bank\") , all of located Wisconsin. The proposed acquisi\u00ad tion of FNC and CHC would be effected through the formation of a new holding company to be named Inland Beloit Cor\u00ad poration, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a cor\u00ad poration that is to be wholly owned by Inland Heritage Corporation and for which a section 3(a) (1) application has been filed with the Board. The proposed acquisitions would involve the merger of FNC and CHC into Inland Beloit Corpo\u00ad ration, giving Inland Beloit Corporation direct ownership of FNC and CHC. As the parent companies of Inland Beloit. Corporation, The Jacobus Company and Inland Heritage Corporation would thereby gain indirect ownership of FNC and CHC. FNC and CHC serve no pur\u00ad pose other than to hold the stock of their respective banks in corporate form, and Inland Beloit Corporation serves no FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 NOTICES 17913 purpose other than to facilitate the ac\u00ad quisition of PNC and CHC. Accordingly, the proposed acquisition of FNC and CHC by Inland Beloit Corporation is treated herein as the proposed acquisi\u00ad tion of Beloit Bank and Community Bank by Applicant. Notice of the applications, affording opportunity for interested persons to sub\u00ad mit comments and views, has been given in accordance with section 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and the Board has considered the applications and all com\u00ad ments received in light of the factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1842(c)). By Order dated February 7, 1977, the Board denied Applicant's previous appli\u00ad cations to acquire Beloit Bank .1 Applicant's current appli\u00ad cations differ from its earlier applications only with respect to their financial aspects. Applicant presently controls four banks with aggregate deposits of $146.8 million .3 Applicant's acquisition of Beloit Bank and Community Bank (aggregate deposits of $85.6 million) would represent Applicant's initial entry into the Janes- ville-Beloit banking market, and would result in Applicant controlling ap\u00ad proximately 21.9 per cent of the deposits therein .3 For reasons cited in the Board's earlier Order, the Board concludes that consummation of the proposed acquisi\u00ad tions would not have any significant adverse effects on existing or potential competition. While competitive considerations were found to be consistent with approval of the proposed acquisitions, the Board was concerned with the financial aspects of Applicant's earlier proposal and con\u00ad cluded that the adverse financial con\u00ad siderations involved warranted denial of those applications. In its February 7th Order, the Board noted that the proposed acquisitions would result in a substantial addition ($3.6 million) to Applicant's al\u00ad ready high level of long-term debt, and stated that it was concerned that Appli\u00ad cant would not be able to meet the in\u00ad creased debt servicing requirements and and also maintain and strengthen the capital of its existing subsidiary banks. The Board concluded that Applicant should direct its financial resources to\u00ad ward strengthening its existing sub\u00ad sidiaries before seeking further expan\u00ad sion of its banking interests. In the context of Applicant's current proposal, the Board regards the financial and managerial resources and future prefects of Applicant, its subsidiaries, and the banks to be acquired, as general\u00ad ly satisfactory and consistent with ap\u00ad proval of the applications. Applicant's current applications contain a sub\u00ad stantially stronger financial proposal than that previously considered, and the Board is of the view that it would enable Applicant to meet the increased debt 142 F ederal Register 9059. i a tb a n k in g data are as of December *5\u00bb unless otherwise indicated. 3 The Janesville-Beloit banking market approximated by Rock County.servicing requirements without placing additional funding requirements on its existing subsidiary banks. Pursuant to its revised financial plan, Applicant in\u00ad tends to promptly reduce the acquisition debt from $4.8 million to $1.3 million, and to bolster the capital positions of two of its existing subsidiary banks-and of Beloit Bank by amounts totaling $1.25 million. Applicant would also maintain approximately $0.7 million as a reserve for future capital contributions to sub\u00ad sidiary banks which would be made as the need arose .4 Accordingly, in view of the substantially revised financial aspects of the proposal, the Board con\u00ad cludes that banking factors are consist\u00ad ent with approval of the applications. In its earlier Order, the Board noted that considerations relating to the con\u00ad venience and needs of the community to be served were not sufficient to out\u00ad weigh the adverse financial factors in\u00ad volved with the proposal. In view of the improved financial considerations re\u00ad flected herein, it now appears that the proposed affiliation of the two Beloit banks with Applicant would enhance their operations and thereby benefit the residents of the area served by the two banks. Accordingly, convenience and needs considerations are consistent with approval of the applications. It is the Board's judgment that the proposed ac\u00ad quisitions would be in the public interest and that the applications should be ap\u00ad proved. On the basis of the record, the applica\u00ad tions are approved for the reasons sum\u00ad marized above. The transaction shall not be made (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of this Order, or (b) later than three months after the effective date of this Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, pur\u00ad suant to delegated authority.

Absent and not voting: Gov\u00ad ernors Jackson and Lilly.Honolulu, Hawaii (\"Bank\") As a result of the exercise of these rights, Applicant would continue to hold 13.7 percent of the voting shares of Bank. Notice of the application, affording op\u00ad portunity for interested persons to sub\u00ad mit comments and views, has been given in accordance with section 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and the Board has considered the application and all com\u00ad ments received in light of the factors set forth in section 3 (c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). Applicant presently owns 13.7 percent of the voting shares of Bank. With de\u00ad posits of approximately $240 million, Bank controls 8.5 percent of the total deposits held by commercial banks in Ha\u00ad waii and is the third largest bank in the State .1 Applicant proposes to acquire 6,867 additional voting shares of Bank through the exercise of its preemptive rights in connection with a new issue of Bank's voting shares. If all of Bank's new shares are purchased, Applicant's percentage ownership of shares of Bank will not increase as a result of the pro\u00ad posal. Consummation of the proposal would not \"have any adverse effect on existing or potential competition, nor would it increase the concentration of banking resources or have any adverse effect on other banks in the area. Thus, competitive considerations are consistent with approval of the application. The financial condition and manage\u00ad rial resources of Applicant and Bank are considered satisfactory and the future prospects for each appear favorable. Thus, the banking factors are consistent with approval of the application. Al\u00ad though there will be no immediate change or increase in the services of\u00ad fered by Bank as a result of the proposed transaction, the considerations relating to the convenience aijd needs of the com\u00ad munity to be served are consistent with approval of the application. It is the Board's judgment that the proposed transaction would be consistent with the public interest and that the application should be approved. Under section 3 (d) of the Bank Hold\u00ad ing Company Act [12 U.S.C. 1842(d) ] the Board may not approve an application by a bank holding company under section 3 of the Act to acquire shares of any \"addi\u00ad tional bank\" located outside of the State in which the operations of the bank hold\u00ad ing company's banking subsidiaries were principally conducted as of July 1, 1966, or the date on which it became a bank holding company, whichever is later, un\u00ad less such acquisition is specifically au\u00ad thorized by the statute laws of the State in which the bank whose shares are to be acquired is located. Applicant became a bank holding company on December 31, 1970, by virtue of its ownership of a ma\u00ad jority of the voting shares of The Sumi\u00ad tomo Bank of California, San Francisco, California, and thus, California is the State of Applicant's principal banking operations. The statute laws of the State of Hawaii do not specifically authorize the acquisition of shares or assets of a i All banking data are as of December 31, 1975.

Thus, the Board may only approve the subject application if Bank is not considered an \"additional bank\" for purposes of section 3(d). Applicant's investment in Bank orig\u00ad inated in 1954, prior to the enactment of the Bank Holding Company Act. Since section 3(d) is prospective in its appli\u00ad cation, that investment was effectively grandfathered at the time Applicant be\u00ad came a bank holding company in 1970. Consummation of the proposed transac\u00ad tion would enable Applicant to maintain its present interest in Bank. The Board has considered the legisla\u00ad tive history of section 3(d), particularly the intent of that section to prevent the interstate expansion of the commercial banking operations of bank holding com\u00ad panies, and has determined that, based on the particular facts and circum\u00ad stances of this case, Bank should not be considered an \"additional bank\" for pur\u00ad poses of that section. Approval of this application would not permit Applicant either to acquire control of an additional bank or to expand its grandfathered in\u00ad terest in Bank. However, in keeping with the policy of section 3(d), this approval is granted subject to the condition that, in the event all of Bank's newly issued shares are not subscribed, Applicant will only acquire and hold such shares as are necessary in order to maintain its present interest in Bank. In a letter of this date to Applicant, the Board has issued a preliminary de\u00ad termination, based upon the rebuttable presumptions of control in \u00a7 225.2(b) (1) of Regulation Y 112 CFR 225.2(b) (1) 1 , that Applicant exercises a controlling in\u00ad fluence over the management or policies of Bank. The Board's decision to approve the subject application was made inde\u00ad pendent of that preliminary determina\u00ad tion of control, and does not signify a Board decision on any further action that may result from such preliminary determination. On the basis of the record, the appli\u00ad cation is approved for the reasons sum\u00ad marized above.

HOW INFORMATION TO B E CO LLECTED WILL B E U SE D The data, to be collected from special li\u00ad braries of State governments, are essential for management uses on the State level. The establishment of size and location of re\u00ad sources and subject specialization will be of importance to other libraries and researchers. For the above reasons, the Association of State Library Agencies (ASLA) has endorsed this survey, and together with the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies (COSLA) have recommended that the data requested in the survey collection instrument be col\u00ad lected. Through the Use of the Library General Information Survey system of standardized core data items, direct comparison of those libraries may be made with other libraries which have been surveyed under this sys\u00ad tem i.e., Public Libraries, College and Uni\u00adversity Libraries, Federal Libraries, and Spe\u00ad cial Libraries in Commerce and Industry. This will provide NCES with additional input to United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organizations (UNESCO). The data gathered by this survey will pro\u00ad vide core data on receipts, expenditures, re\u00ad sources, staffing, reference and loan trans\u00ad actions, facilities, etc. For the first time, this survey will identify sources of similar sub\u00ad ject matter which will stimulate inter-li\u00ad brary loans, and identify subject resources for cooperatives and networks. NCLIS will use the data of NCES surveys which will become part of the \"National In\u00ad ventory of Library Needs\" in conjunction with The White House Conference on Li\u00ad braries. CONTU will use the data for its re\u00ad port to Congress on the uses of copyrighted data in libraries. The National Library of Medicine will use the data to identify health science resources of special libraries in State governments. The data will be used also by adminis\u00ad trators, educators, researchers, and libraries in identifying similar interests and sources of interlibrary exchange information and sharing of resources. 7.

HOW INFORMATION TO B E CO LLECTED WILL B E U SED There is no comprehensive, nationwide, directory or statistical report of the library cooperatives, consortia, and networks, avail\u00ad able, although the Federal Government, State governments, and local governments have been supporting this relatively new type of library organization at an increasing rate for some ten years. This survey will rem\u00ad edy this gap in our knowledge. The purpose of the survey is to collect and report data on the impact of computers on libraries and in\u00ad formation centers, and to help assess the re\u00ad sults of the Federal legislation designed to promote and support library cooperatives, consortia, and networks at the national multi-state, State, and local levels. At pres\u00ad ent, these organizations are spreading and interconnecting, forming linkages with Fed\u00ad eral, State, and local libraries, and no direc\u00ad tory and no statistical survey of their opera\u00ad tions exist, nationally or regionally; only State networks have been surveyed in some degree. This information will be used by the Office of Libraries and Learning Resources of the Office of Education to provide basic data for the drafting of new legislation for library cooperatives, consortia, and networks; to pro\u00ad vide data for comparison purposes (i.e. so that these organizations that receive Federal monies can be compared with the ones that do not receive Federal monies); and to pro\u00ad vide a statistical base so that when the sur- vey is repeated in a few years, trends wil! be able to be determined for both the Fed- erally funded and the non-Federally fundee categories of these organizations. loca* governments will use th< nrormation provided by this survey for th< ame purposes, at their levels. The academic public, and special libraries that are eithei + . mber\u00ae ant* users or are potential users o: services of these organizations, will us\u00ab information for evaluation of the service!provided by the library cooperatives, con\u00ad sortia, and networks available to them, as well as the comprehensiveness and cost of suoh services, as related to their expenditures for and use of such services in the future.This information is also needed by the audiovisual, microform, computer, and other library-support industries in making deci\u00ad sions respecting the manufacturing and mar\u00ad keting of their products and services. 7.

(B) Proposed solutions to the availability problem (including higher cost which contributes to making insurance un\u00ad available) such as: (1) Full insurance availability; (2) Federal subsidy through federal stamp program; (3) FAIR plans, automobile assigned risk pools and Joint underwriting associations through self-support\u00ad ing programs. (C) Disaster insurance. (D) New riot reinsurance contract. (E) Proposed changes in federal crime in\u00ad surance program. (F ) Other matters. The meeting is open to the public.

The environmental impact of con\u00ad structing between two and four miles of new 115-kV transmission line and the construction of a new substation will be described. Comments on these proposed new facilities will be received from the public. All interested parties are urged to attend. All comments are welcomed in order to assist the administration in fully evaluating the environmental factors pertinent to- this particular aspect of BPA's Fiscal Year 1978 Program. Com\u00ad ments received will be conisdered in the preparation of the Final Environmental Statement. The purpose of the above project is to service growing commercial, industrial, and residential electric loads in the Ellensburg area. BPA proposes to build between two and four miles of new 115-kV transmis\u00ad sion line and a new substation occupy\u00ad ing approximately two acres of land. One alternative would require approximately one-half mile of new access road. Limitations on land use in the area of the right-of-way and the substation location could be expected to result from constructing the facility. Vegetation removal would total approximately four acres. Some erosion and sedimentation would occur. Minor short-term disturb\u00ad ances to agricultural land would also occur. In addition, there would be some visual impact as well as noise and other minor disturbances during construction. In addition to the nonconstruction al\u00ad ternative, with its lack of environmental impacts and resultant inability to ade\u00ad quately service the anticipated electrical load growth in the Ellensburg area, three alternative transmission line locations have been identified. The locations of the various alternatives and the environ\u00ad mental impact associated with each are more thoroughly presented in the Draft Facility Location Supplement on Ellens\u00ad burg Service. Copies of the Draft Facility Location Supplement describing the proposal are available for inspection in the library of the Headquarters Office of BPA, 1002 N.E.

Center Laurel, Maryland SUBJECT: Authorization fo r an exemption to the 30-day Federal Register publication requirement As Dr. Ray Erickson informed Mr. Larry LaRochelle on Wednesday, March 23rd, the Puerto Rican Parrot (Amazona v itta ta ) is one o f the most seriously endangered birds in the world. Essential acti\u00f4ns are in progress and steps are being proposed which, i f delayed, could resu lt in even greater impairment o f the prospects of. su rvival o f th is sp ecifs. Approval o f the follow ing proposed exemption to the 30-day Federal Register publication requirement is requested on the basis o f the ju s tific a tio n which follow s. The w ild population of Puerto Rican Parrots has been fluctuating at about 15-20' individuals fo r the la s t 6 years. A d a p tive population of the species has been established to guard against calamitous loss o f the w ild population (e .g ., from a hurricane) and to serve as stock for augmenting th\u00e9 existin g w ild population, and fo r establishing new w ild populations o f the species. Total captive stock now includes 11 birds, 9 o f which are in Puerto Rico and 2 o f which are at-'Patuxent. Of these 11 birds, 1 are now old enough to be-breeders and 3 have la id eggs although there has as yet b\u00e8en no. successful reproduction in cap\u2014 t iv it y . Unfortunately, i t now appears that the sex r a tio o f captives is biased toward- females. Through egg-laying evidence arid through Karyotype analyses run on feather pulp by personnel o f the Houston Zoo we now know that at le a s t -5 o f the mature birds are female, and there is only.one certain male amorig the remaining 6 captives. Of the 5 captives s t i l l o f uncertain sex, 3 are o f s u ffic ie n tly ' sub\u00ad normal qu ality that th eir p oten tial fo r eventual breeding.is in considerable doubt. Thus, regardless o f what sex these unknowns iuTn out to be, there is a '-shortage o f healthy males in the captive population. - , . The genetic base fo r reproduction among the captives is also very lim ited . Among the 11 birds, there are 6 fam ily stocks represented, but only 3 o f the stocks are represented by birds w ith clea r breeding ' V - ^ B u y X J .S . S a vin gs B o n d s R egularly o n th e Payroll Savings Plan t FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 potential. One pair o\u00a3 parrots in the wild, the West Fork pair, is as yet unrepresented by progeny in captivity, and it is of crucial importance to the success of the captive program that we obtain repre\u00ad sentation from this pair, especially if males can be identified before final taking of young.. The West Fork pair laid an unusually large clutch of 4 eggs this spring and all 4 eggs have proved fertile. Two have been taken into captivity under existing permit authority, and the resulting hatchlings, now a few days old, are being hand-raised at the field station. These two birds are, of course, of unknown sex, but if sex of these birds and their siblings still in the wild can be quickly determined, it will be possible through juggling of members of the brood between the wild and the field station to selectively obtain two males (should they exist) and still allow the pair to fledge two young in the wild. Until the present there has been no safe, simple, and quick way of sexing parrots in captivity^ and we have been separating pairs out largely on a self-selection basis. One such pair that reached maturity this year has turned out to consist of two females, one.of which has produced five eggs, and the other has just started laying. The karyotype sexing we have been pursuing with personnel of the Houston Zoo for the past 2 years has been relatively slow, often requires repeated sampling, although it gives reliable results when completed. Just last week we learned that Dr. Ellen Rasch' of Marquette University has developed a fast sexing method which requires only one drop of blood smeared on a glass slide to distinguish sex of young or old birds through DNA density differentials in the two sexes. The technique has been used so far with success on various species of cranes and poultry, and there^ are good reasons to hope it may also prove successful with parrbts. If | so, it represents a real, breakthrough because it allows sexing with an absolute minimum of disturbance or potential injury to the birds,- at a minimum of expense1 of time yand- effort on the part' of researchers. Yesterday, we sent blood smears of 4 Hispaniolan Parrots of known sex to Dr. Rasch, and she has promised results within two weeks as to whether the technique is workable with this species. Since the Hispaniolan Parrot is vfery .closely related to the Puerto Rican Parrot, we assume that success with this species would be a good indication of probable success with the Puerto Rican Parrot. What we propose is the following: We believe it to be essential to obtain two additional males for the captive population, preferably from fhe West Fork pair of parrots, since this .pair is as yet unrepresented in captivity We would like to take blood samples from the WestFork nestlings and from the rest of the known and unknown-sexed parrots already in captivity for sexing-by Dr. Rasch. Should it turn.out that there are not two males in the West Fork.brood of 4, we would like to seek male nestlings from the * other two currently active pairs in the wild to make up a total of twomales to be brought into captivity this spring.. It will be necessary to mark each nestling with food coloring on down-feathers during the period in which sex-determination is being made; so that the young will be later identifiable when sexes have been determined. Should it turn out that the blood-smear technique of Dr. Rasch does not prove successful in sexing the parrots, we have .obtained a commitment from the San Diego Zoo to send a member, of its staff, Dr. Baumgartel,_to Puerto Rico for karyotype-sexing-of nestlings from feather pulp. To use the feather pulp technique, nestlings will have to be at least 5-6 weeks old, as no 'large flight feathers are sufficiently developed before this age. Since with either. technique,. we have only a f ejw weeks' within which to per\u00ad form the necessary procedure? (young in the nests wi^Ll have fledged within 8'weeks of today), we would appreciate an exemption to the 30-day Federal Register publication requirement and expeditious consideration of this proposal. Under our current permit the above operations are not specif\u2014 ; ically mentioned. -However, because the situation facing the Puerto Rican Parrot is ^so desperate, we believe that this request is in keeping with the spirit of the intent of the authority under which an exemption can be approved. The procurement from the wild of two male Puerto Rican Parrot chicks this spring was discussed, with and unanimously concurred in by the Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery Team during its mbst-recent meeting in mid- March 1977. The Commonwealth representative on this Recovery Team, Mr. Herbert Rafaelle, indicated that the Commonwealth permit authorizes this procedure on an emergency basis. Lucille F.

I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19898, (\"Applicant\" ), a Delaware cor\u00ad poration, has filed an application pur\u00ad suant to Section 17(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"Act\" ) for an order exempting from the provisions^ Section 17(a) of the Act Applicant's proposed grant to Toyo Products Com\u00ad pany, Ltd. (\"Toyo\" ) , a Japanese cor\u00ad poration, of an exclusive right, with the right to grant similar rights to others, to use certain technology relating to the manufacture of spandex fiber. All inter\u00ad ested persons are referred to the appli\u00ad cation on file with the Commission for a statement of the representations con\u00ad tained therein, which are summarized below. Applicant states that Toyo, a manu\u00ad facturer of spandex fibers since 1966, seeks to acquire exclusive rights to use certain technology (\"Sight Box Insert Technology\" ) developed by, Applicant to increase productive capacity of spandex fiber spinning riiachinery. Spandex fibers are described by Applicant as elastic tex\u00ad tile yarns which have, in part, replaced cut rubber filaments in apparel markets. The application states that the Appli\u00ad cant and Toyo have executed an agree\u00ad ment (the \"Agreement\" ) providing for the grant to Toyo of an exclusive right, with the right to grant similar rights to others, to use Sight Box Insert Tech\u00ad nology in Japan in the manufacture of spandex fiber. Applicant submits that the Agreement is subject to (1) receipt of the order requested herein, and (2) ap\u00ad proval by appropriate Japanese govern\u00ad mental authorities. Applicant states that the Agreement has been submitted to those authorities, and that their ap\u00ad proval is expected shortly. Pursuant to the Agreement, Toyo proposes to pay Applicant $.20 per kilogram of spandex fiber packed by Toyo (or any other per\u00ad son to whom Toyo has granted the aforementioned rights) which have been produced through the use of Sight Box Insert Technology, provided that such payments shall not exceed a total of $400,000. ' The application states that Christiana Securities Company (\" Christiana\"), a FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 NOTICES 17925 non-diversifled, closed-end management investment company registered under the Act; owns approximately 27.8% of the outstanding common stock of Appli\u00ad cant, which in turn owns 50% of the outstanding common stock of Toyo. The application further states that the re\u00ad maining 50% of Toyo's outstanding common stock is owned by Toray Indus\u00ad tries, Inc., a Japanese corporation. Ap\u00ad plicant concludes that both Applicant and Toy\u00f4 are (1) presumed to be con\u00ad trolled by Christiana, and (2) affiliated persons of Christiana, for purposes of the Act. Section 17(a) of the Act provides, in part, that it shall be unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered invest\u00ad ment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal, knowingly to sell to or purchase from such registered company, or any com\u00ad pany controlled by such company, any security or other property. Applicant states that the proposed grant to Toyo of the exclusive rights to use Sight Box Insert Technology may be prohibited by Section 17(a) and therefore requests an order exempting that proposed grant from the provisions of Section 17(a). Section 17(b) of the Act provides that the Commission, upon application shall exempt a proposed transaction from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the Act if evidence establishes that the terms of the proposed transaction, Including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and that the proposed trans\u00ad action is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned and with the general pur\u00ad poses of the Act. Applicant asserts that the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on .the part of any person, and that the pay\u00ad ments under the Agreement reasonably reflect the value of the technical infor\u00ad mation conveyed by the Agreement. Applicant states (1) that Toyo is in\u00ad terested in Sight Box Insert Technology as a means of increasing its spandex fiber manufacturing capacity and believes the potential market for such fiber in Japan is favorable; (2) that Toyo does not maintain a research and development or\u00ad ganization and,. therefore, must pur\u00ad chase new technology from others; and (3) that, by granting such technology to Toyo, Applicant- will provide itself with an opportunity to capitalize on its Sight Box Insert Technology in the Japanese market. Finally, Applicant submits that the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of Christiana and with the general purposes of the Act. Notice is further given that any inter\u00ad ested person may, not later than April 18, 1977, at 5 :30 p.m., submit to the Com\u00ad mission in writing a request for a hear\u00ad ing on the matter accompanied by a statement as to the nature of his inter\u00ad est, the reason for such request, and the issues, if any, of fact or law proposed tobe controverted, or he may request that he be notified if the Commission shall order a hearing thereon.

Application for Exemption March 25, 1977. Notice is hereby given that Lykes Bros., Inc., 512 Florida Avenue, Tampa, Florida 33602 (\"Lykes\" ) , a holding company, has filed an application on be\u00ad half of itself and each of its subsidiaries as such under Sections 3(a) (1) and 3(a) (3) of the Public Utility Holding Com\u00ad pany Act of 1935 (\"Act\" ) . All interested persons are referred to the application, which is summarized below, for a com\u00ad plete statement concerning the requested exemption. Lykes, a Florida corporation, is di\u00ad rectly or through its nonutility subsidi\u00ad aries indirectly engaged in cattle ranch\u00ad ing, meat packing, dairy, citrus and sugar processing, stevedoring and con\u00ad struction. Lykes' manufacturing and processing activities are carried on pri\u00ad marily in Florida. On a nonconsolidated basis, Lykes reported total assets at De\u00ad cember 31, 1976 of $57 million, including investments in and advances to nonutil\u00ad ity subsidiaries of $28.8 million. Lykes' corporate operating revenues for the pe\u00ad riod then ended were $114.6 million. Lykes has nine nonutility subsidiaries, of which the Bank of Clearwater (81% * owned) and Lykes Pasco Packing Com\u00ad pany (97.5% owned) are the largest. The Bank of Clearwater has total assets of $130 million and operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 1976, of $8 million. At September 30, 1976, Lykes Pasco reported total assets of $67.9 million and sales for the year then ended of $131.3 million. Lykes is a holding company, as de\u00ad fined under Section 2(a) (7) of the Act. It owns substantially all of the capital stock of Peoples Gas System, Inc. (\"Peo\u00ad ples\" ), a statutory gas utility company. Lykes acquired control of Peoples in June 1976, and is continuing to purchase the publicly-held minority stock interest in Peoples which remains outstanding. Peoples supplies natural gas and, through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, liquefied petroleum gas (LP Gas) to ap\u00ad proximately 126,000 customers in Dade and Broward counties on the south\u00ad eastern coast of Florida and Hills\u00ad borough County on Florida's west coast. It serves, among other communities, Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Pom\u00ad pano Beach and Tampa. At September 30, 1976, Peoples had total utility plant of $45.5 million and, for the twelve months then ended, $24.9 million of op\u00ad erating revenues, of which approxi\u00ad mately 90% was attributable to the sale of natural gas. The company is subject to the jurisdiction of the Florida Public Service Commission. Lykes claims an exemption under Sec\u00ad tion 3(a)(1) of the Act. It states that both it and Peoples are organized under Florida law and that all of Peoples' in\u00ad come and substantially all of Lykes' in\u00ad come are derived from operations in Florida. Lykes also asserts an exemption under Section 3(a) (3) . It claims that itis only incidentially a holding company, being primarily engaged in nonutility businesses and not deriving a material part of its income from Peoples. In anticipation of its acquisition of Peoples, Lykes filed a statement claim\u00ad ing exemption under Section 3(a) (1) of the Act pursuant to Rule 2 of the Gen\u00ad eral Rules and Regulations, promulgated thereunder. By letter dated December 22, 1976, the Secretary of the Commission notified Lykes, pursuant to Rule 6, that a question exists as to whether Lykes is entitled to the claimed, exemption. The letter also advised Lykes that its claim to exempt status would terminate 30 days after such notice unless, in the interim, it should choose to file a formal appli\u00ad cation under Section 3(a) requesting the Commission to issue, after notice and opportunity for hearing, an exemption order for itself and its subsidiaries. Lykes filed such application on January 12,1977. Pending a determination, which either grants or denies its application, Lykes is and will remain an exempt holding i company under Section 3(c) of the Act. Notice is further given that any inter\u00ad ested person may, not later than April 25, 1977, request in writing that a hear\u00ad ing be held on such matter, stating the nature of his interest, the reasons for such request, and the issues of fact or law raised by said application which he desires to controvert; or he may request that he be notified if the Commission should order a hearing thereon.

Notice is hereby given that the Com\u00ad mission proposes, pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Investment Company Act of1940 (\"Act\" ) , to declare, by order on its own motion, that Mercury Growth Funds, Inc., Suite 314 Professional Bldg., 215 Franklin Street, Monterey, Califor\u00ad nia 93040 (\"Fund\" ), registered under the Act as an open-end investment com\u00ad pany, has ceased to be an investment company as defined in the Act. The Fund registered under the Act on June 11, 1969. Information contained in the files of the Commission indicates that the Fund filed a registration state\u00ad ment under the Securities Act of 1933 (File No. 2-33687) on June 23,1969. This registration statement did not become effective, and was ordered abandoned by the Commission on July 20, 1972. Thus, the Fund has never engaged in a public distribution of its securities. The State of Delaware, the state under which the Fund was organized, voided the Fund's corporate charter on April 15, 1972, for non-payment of taxes. The Fund has never filed any of the periodic reports required by the Act, and communica\u00ad tions sent to the Fund's last known ad\u00ad dress by the Staff of the Commission have been returned as undeliverable. Thus, it appears that the Fund is not currently engaged in the business of an investment company, and that its corpo\u00ad rate existence has terminated. Section 8(f) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that whenever the Com\u00ad mission, on its own motion or upon ap\u00ad plication, finds that a registered invest\u00ad ment company has Geased to be an in\u00ad vestment company, it shall so declare by order, which may be made upon appro\u00ad priate conditions if necessary for the protection of investors, and upon the taking effect of such order, the registra\u00ad tion of such company shall cease to bejn effect. Notice is further given tha any inter\u00ad ested person may, not later than April 25, 1977, at 5:30 p.m., submit to the Commis\u00ad sion in writing a request for a hearing on this matter accompanied by a statement as to the nature of his interest, the rea\u00ad sons for such request, and the issues, if any, of fact or law proposed to be contro\u00ad verted, or he may request that he be no\u00ad tified if the Commission shall order a hearing thereon. Any such communica\u00ad tion should be addressed: Secretary, Se\u00ad curities and Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C. 20549. A copy of such request shall be served personally or by mail upon the Fund at the address stated above. Proof of such service (by affi\u00ad davit, or in the case of an attorney-at- law, by certificate) shall be filed contem\u00ad poraneously with the request. As pro\u00ad vided by Rule 0-5 of the Rules and Regu\u00ad lations promulgated under the Act, an order disposing of this matter will be is\u00ad sued as of course following said date, un\u00ad less the Commission thereafter orders a hearing upon request, or upon the Com\u00ad mission's own motion.

Agreement With Municipal Authority for Construction of Pollution Control Equip\u00ad ment Financed by Sale of Revenue Bonds March 28, 1977. Notice is hereby given that Ohio Power Company, 301 Cleveland Avenue, S.W.^ Canton, Ohio 44702 (\"Ohio Power\" ) , an electric utility subsidiary company of American Electric Power Company, Inc., a registered holding company, has filed ah application-declaration with this Commission designating Sections 9(a) and 12(d) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (\"Act\" ) and Rule 44(b) (3) promulgated thereunder as ap\u00ad plicable to the proposed transactions. All interested persons are referred to the application-declaration, which is sum\u00ad marized below, for a complete state\u00ad ment of the proposed transactions. Ohio Power states that in order to comply with prescribed environmental quality control standards of the State of West Virginia it has been and will be nec\u00ad essary to construct certain high efficiency electrostatic precipitators for particu\u00ad late emission control and related facili\u00ad ties (the \"Project\" ) to be installed on Units 2, 4, and 5 at its Phillip Spom Gen\u00ad erating Station. It is estimated that the Project will cost approximately $80,000,- 000, of which at December 31, 1976 ap\u00ad proximately $17,000,000 had been ex\u00ad pended. By resolutions adopted on March ' 11, 1975 and October 13, 1976, Mason County, West Virginia (\"County\" ) deter\u00ad mined that it would authorize and issue one or more series of its pollution control revenue bonds (\"Revenue Bonds\") in a maximum amount of $80,000,000 to fi\u00ad nance the acquisition, construction and installation of the Project. Ohio Power proposes to enter into an agreement of sale (\"Agreement\") with the County whereby the County will con\u00ad struct and install the facilities compris\u00ad ing the Project. To finance the Project, the County will issue Revenue Bonds in an initial principal amount of $30,000,- 000 (\" Series A Bonds\" ) and additional Revenue Bonds in principal amounts presently estimated not to exceed $50,- 000,000, sufficient to cover construction cost of the Project. The proceeds from the sale of the Series A Bonds will be de\u00ad posited by the County with The Charles\u00ad ton National Bank (Charleston, West Virginia), as trustee (\"Trustee\" ) under an indenture to be entered into between the County and the Trustee (the \"Inden\u00ad ture\" ) pursuant to which the Series A Bonds are to be issued and secured. Such proceeds will be applied to payment of the cost of construction of the Project. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17930 NOTICES The Agreement will also provide for the sale of the Project to Ohio Power, the payment by Ohio Power of the purchase price in semi-annual installments over a term of years, and the assignment and pledge to the Trustee of the County's in\u00ad terest in, and of the monies receivable by the County under, the Agreement. The Agreement will provide that each installment of the purchase price for the project payable by Ohio Power will be in such an amount (together with other monies held by the Trustee under the Indenture for that purpose) as will -enable the County to pay, when due: (i) the interest on the Series A Bonds, any additional bonds and any refunding bonds, (ii) the principal amount of the Series A Bonds, any additional bonds and any refunding bonds payable at the time of their respective stated maturities, and (iii) amounts, including any accrued in\u00ad terest, payable in connection with any mandatory redemption of the Series A Bonds, any additional bonds or any re\u00ad funding bonds. The Agreement will also obligate Ohio Power to pay the fees and charges of the Trustee, as well as cer\u00ad tain administrative expenses of the County. The Agreement will farther pro\u00ad vide that Ohio Power may prepay the purchase price of the Project in whole: (i) upon the occurrence of certain events by paying amounts sufficient to redeem all Revenue Bonds then outstanding, the fees and expenses of the Trustee, and all other amounts payable under the Inden\u00ad ture, or (ii) at any time by depositing monies in the Bond Fund (as defined in the Indenture) or delivering to the Trus\u00ad tee governmental obligations sufficient in either case to provide for the release of the Indenture in accordance with its terms. Upon prepayment of the entire purchase price of the Project, Ohio Power may terminate the Agreement. Ohio Power may also prepay the purchase price in part, such payments to be paid to the Trustee for deposit in the Bond Fund, credited against the purchase price, and used for the redemption of outstanding Revenue Bonds in the man\u00ad ner and to the extent the outstanding Revenue Bonds are redeemable or sub\u00ad ject to purchase as provided in the In\u00ad denture. Ohio Power proposes to convey the elec\u00ad trostatic precipitators and related equip\u00ad ment, to the extent they have already been constructed and are then in place at the plant site (\"Existing Facilities\" ) , subject to its First Mortgage Lien, to the County. The Existing Facilities will thereupon become a part of the Project. Ohio Power will receive from the pro\u00ad ceeds from the sale of the Series A Bonds an amount equal to Ohio Power's origi\u00ad nal cost of the Existing Facilities. The proceeds so received will be added by Ohio-Power to its general corporate funds and will be used to prepay unsecured short-term debt, and for construction. It is contemplated that the Series A Bonds will be sold by the County pur\u00ad suant to arrangements with a group of underwriters represented* by Goldman, Sachs & Co. In accordance with the laws of the State of West Virginia, the inter\u00ad est rate to be borne by the Series A Bondswill be fixed by the County Commission of the County. Although Ohio Power will not be a party to the underwriting arrangements for the Series A Bonds, Ohio Power will not enter into the Agreement unless the terms of the Series A Bonds and their sale by the County are satisfactory to it. Ohio Power has been advised that the annual interest rates on obligations, the interest, on which is tax exempt, histori\u00ad cally have been and can be expected at the time of issue of the Series A Bonds to be iy2% to 2V2% lower than the rates on obligations of like tenor and com\u00ad parable quality, the interest on which is fully subject to federal income tax. The Series A Bonds will be dated on or about the first day of the month in which they are issued, will bear interest semi\u00ad annually and will mature at a date or dates not more than 30 years frqm the date of their issuance. It is expected that the Series A Bonds will not be redeem\u00ad able at the option of the County within 10 years from their issue date except under certain circumstanc\u00e8s. Series A Bonds will b\u00e9 subject to mandatory re\u00ad demption under the circumstances and terms specified in the Indenture. Fees and expenses, incident to the pro\u00ad posed disposition o f'the Existing Facili\u00ad ties and the acquisition of the Project (as distinguished from and excluding fees and expenses incident to the sale of the Series A Bonds by the County pay\u00ad able out of the proceeds of such sale) will be supplied by amendment. It is stated the Public Utility Commission of Ohio has jurisdiction over the proposed trans\u00ad action and that no other state commis\u00ad sion and no federal commission, other than this Commission, has jurisdiction over the proposed transaction. Notice is further given that any in\u00ad terested person may, not later than April 22, 1977, request in writing that a hear\u00ad ing be held on such matter, stating the nature of his interest, the reasons for such request, and the issues of fact or law raised by the application-declaration which he desires to controvert; or he may request that he be notified if the Com\u00ad mission should order a hearing thereon. Any such request should be addressed: Secretary Securities and Exchange Com\u00ad mission, Washington, D.C. 20549.

Abandonment of Rail Lines March 21, 1977. In the matter of the Wabash Railroad Company and Norfolk and Western Rail\u00ad way Company abandonment between Fairbury and Clay in Livingston County, Illinois, AB 10 (Sub-No. 6) ; Illinois Cen\u00ad tral Gulf Railroad Company abandoment between Saxony and Pontiac, in Living\u00ad ston County, Illinois, AB 43 (Sub-No. 20) ; Illinois Central Gulf Railroad Com\u00ad pany abandonment between Flanagan and Minonk- Junction in Livingston andWoodford Counties, Illinois, AB 43 (Sub\u00ad ito. 21). The Interstate Commerce Commission hereby gives notice that its section of Energy and Environment has concluded that the proposed abandonments if ap\u00ad proved by the Commission, do not con\u00ad stitute a major Federal action signifi\u00ad cantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321, et seq., and that preparation of a detailed envi\u00ad ronmental impact statement will not be required under section 4332(2) (C) of the NEPA. It was concluded, among other things, that the diversion of the traffic presently moving over the lines would not appreci\u00ad ably affect ambient environmental con\u00ad ditions in the affected corridors and tributary territory. A serious adverse im\u00ad pact on rural and community develop\u00ad ment would not be expected to result from the proposed abandonments. No historic or archeological sites are in\u00ad volved in the proposed actions. This conclusion is contained in a staff- prepared environmental threshold sur\u00ad vey, which is available on request to the Interstate Commerce Commission, Office of Proceedings, Washington, D.\u00c7. 20423; telephone 202-275-7011. Interested persons may comment on this matter by filing their statements in writing with the Interstate Commerce Commission,. Washington, D.C. 20423, on or before May 4, 1977. It should be emphasized that the en\u00ad vironmental threshold assessment sur\u00ad vey represents an evaluation of the en\u00ad vironmental issues in the proceeding and does not purport to resolve the issue of whether the present or future public convenience and necessity permit dis\u00ad continuance of the line proposed for abandonment. Consequently, comments on the environmental study should be limited to discussion of the presence or absence of environmental .impacts and reasonable alternatives. Robert L. O swald , Secretary.

Although some of the policies, prac\u00ad tices, and procedures contained in those cancelled memorandums and statements have been rescinded or altered in sub\u00ad stance by issuance of the new regula\u00ad tions, many have been retained and in\u00ad corporated in the adopted regulations. The new regulations comprehensively outline the authorities and responsibili\u00ad ties for the administration of CHAMPUS and identify eligible CHAMPUS benefici\u00ad aries and authorized CHAMPUS pro\u00ad viders. They also establish the scope of authorized benefits for both the \"Basic Program\" and the \"Program for the Handicapped\" of CHAMPUS and set forth substantive and procedural re\u00ad quirements for the submission, re\u00ad view, and payment of claims filed under them. In addition, the regu\u00ad lations fix rules and procedures gov\u00ad erning situations where benefits un\u00ad der other programs overlap or duplicate those under CHAMPUS, and they estab\u00ad lish an administrative-appeals process which includes informal review, recon\u00ad sideration of an informal review, and, in certain circumstances, appeal to, or for\u00ad mal review by, the Office of the Civilian Health and Medical Program for the Uni\u00ad formed Services (OCHAMPUS). In some cases, appealing parties are entitled to an administrative hearing by a hearing offi\u00ad cer as part of the appeal process. Pursuant to a court order issued in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in the case of Edison v. Department of Defense, the regulations pertaining to the administra\u00ad tive-appeals process were previously pub\u00ad lished in Volume 41 of the Federal Reg\u00ad ister at page 47505 on September 29, 1976, to give public notice and to invite public comment. Only a few comments were received, generally expressing con\u00ad cern over the minimum-dollar require\u00adments for various levels of appeal. In rec\u00ad ognition of this concern, the require\u00ad ments have been adjusted downward so that a CHAMPUS contractor's decision is final only in cases involving amounts in dispute of $50.00 or less (down from $100.00 or less) and so that there is a right to an administrative hearing by a hearing officer in cases involving amounts in dispute in excess of $300.00 (down from $500.00). In addition, the time to file an amended request for a hearing was extended from lOjto 30 days, and the requirement that a transcript be prepared and a copy provided to an ap\u00ad pealing party for all hearings was changed to a requirement that all hear\u00ad ings be taped and a duplicate tape be provided to an appealing party upon re\u00ad quest. Other minor changes have also been made for clarification and technical purposes. With the exception of the sections per\u00ad taining to the administrative-appeals process (\u00a7 199.16), the regulations were adopted without use of the proposed rulemaking process (see 32 CFR Part 296). The proposed rulemaking process was not used, because the regulations which do not concern the administrative- appeals process were still being developed until recently. When these regulations were developed, it was determined that further delay in their adoption would be contrary to the public interest (32 CFR 296.2(d)(4)). Among other things, the absence of comprehensive regulations for CHAMPUS has led to administrative dif\u00ad ficulties and, in some cases, litigation regarding basic issues like eligibility to benefits, scope of authorized benefits, minimum standards and requirements for authorized providers, acceptable pro\u00ad vider billing practices, and reasonable provider charges. In view of these and other problems relating to the adminis\u00ad tration of CHAMPUS which derive _at least in part from the lack of comprehen\u00ad sive implementation, adoption at the earliest practicable date was deemed necessary. In recognition of the value of public comment, written comments on the adopted regulations comprising new Part 199 are invited until June 3, 1977. Changes resulting from comments re\u00ad ceived during the 60-day period which operate to increase the rights, benefits, or privileges currently provided in the adopted regulations will be effective retroactively to this date insofar as ad\u00ad ministratively feasible. Written comments on these regulations shall include the name and address of the submitting person and reasons for recommended changes. The comments should be submitted to: Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Resources and Programs), Room 3E182, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20301. 32 CFR Chapter I is amended by add\u00ad ing a new Part 199, reading as follows: Sec. 199.1 Purpose. 199.2 Cancellations. 199.3 Applicability and scope.Sec. 199.4 Policy. 199.5 Responsibilities. 199.6 Effective date and implementation. 199.7 General provisions. 199.8 Definitions. 199.9 Eligibility. 199.10 Basic program benefits. 199.11 Program of the handicapped. 199.12 Authorized providers. 199.13 Claims submission, review and pay\u00ad ment. 199.14 Double coverage. 199.15 Federal Medical Care Recovery Act. 199.16 Appeal and hearing procedures.

(Refer to Chapter III of this regulation, \"Eligibility\" .) D. Medical Benefits Program,. The CHAMPUS is a program of medical benefits pro\u00advided by the Federal Government under public law to specified categories of individ\u00ad uals who are qualified for these benefits by virtue of their relationship to one of the seven Uniformed Services. Although similar in structure in many of its aspects, CHAMPUS is not an insurance program in that it does not involve a contract guarantee\u00ad ing the indemnification of an insured party against a specified loss in return for a premium paid. Further^ CHAMPUS is not subject to those state regulatory bodies or agencies which control the insurance busi\u00ad ness generally. (e) Program funds. The funds used by the CHAMPUS Program are appropri\u00ad ated funds furnished by the Congress through the annual Appropriations Act for the Department of Defense and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. These funds are further dis\u00ad bursed by agents of the Government under contracts negotiated by the Direc- . tor, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), under the provisions of the Armed Services Procurement Regulation (ASPR). These agents (referred to in this Regulation as \"CHAMPUS Contractors\" ) receive claims against the Program and adjudi\u00ad cate the claims under the provisions of this Regulation and in accordance with administrative procedures and instruc\u00ad tions set forth in their contracts. The funds expended for CHAMPUS benefits are Federal funds provided CHAMPUS Contractors solely to pay CHAMPUS claims and are not a part of or obtained from the CHAMPUS Contractor's funds related to other programs or insurance coverage. CHAMPUS Contractors are reimbursed for the adjudication and pay\u00ad ment of CHAMPUS claims at a fixed rate set forth in their contracts. Note : Where a CHAMPUS contract has not yet been competitively procured, or where award was made on an emergency basis, ad\u00ad ministrative expenses are, or may be on a cost-reimbursement rather than fixed-price basis. In such Instances, reimbursement is is limited to those administrative expenses incurred and directly related to the adminis\u00ad tration of the CHAMPUS Program. (f) Claims adjudication and process\u00ad ing. The Director, OCHAMPUS is re\u00ad sponsible for making such arrangements as are necessary to adjudicate and proc\u00ad ess CHAMPUS claims worldwide. (1) The United States.\u2014 -(i) Contract\u00ad ing out. The primary method of process\u00ad ing CHAMPUS claims in the United States is through competitively procured, fixed-price contracts. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) is responsi\u00ad ble for the issuance of appropriate Re\u00ad quests for Proposals (REP's) and the evaluation and award of such contracts for the purpose of adjudicating and proc\u00ad essing CHAMPUS claims (and related . supporting activities). Such contracts may be negotiated for a period of up to 1 year with the option to renew for 2 successive one-year periods. Under un\u00ad usual circumstances (as set forth in Sec\u00ad tion m of ASPR), the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) is author\u00ad ized to negotiate such a CHAMPUS claims adjudication and processing agreement on an emergency contracting basis, generally limited to a six-monthperiod with option to renew for one sub\u00ad sequent six-month period. Unless other\u00ad wise specifically approved by the ASD (H A ), at the end of the second six-month jjeriod, such emergency award must be terminated and a contract awarded on the basis of competitive procurement. Note: If necessary, an emergency award may be made on a cost-reimbursement rather than a fixed-price basis. (ii) In-house. The Director, OCHAM PUS (or a designee) is authorized to ad\u00ad judicate and process certain CHAMPUS claims in-house at OCHAMPUS, when it is determined to be in the best interests of the Program subject to considerations set forth in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76. Such in-house claims processing may involve a special or unique type of claim (such as claims for dental care, or inpatient stays in res\u00ad idential treatment centers, or claims under the Program for the Handicapped) or all claims for a specific geographic area. (2) Outside the United States. \u2014 (i) Option: Special Subsidiary Office or con\u00ad tracting out. For adjudicating and proc\u00ad essing CHAMPUS claims for services and/or supplies provided outside the United States the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) has the option of either setting up a special subsidiary claims paying operation (such as OCHAMPUS EUR) or contracting out in the same manner as described in paragraph (f) (1) (i) of this section. Such claims pay\u00ad ing operations are reviewed periodically to determine whether current arrange\u00ad ments continue to be appropriate and the most effective. (ii) Support agreements. In those situations outside the United States which demand special arrangements, the Director, OCHAMPUS may enter into support agreements through the Depart\u00ad ment of Defense with any of the Military Departments or other Government agen\u00ad cy to process CHAMPUS claims in spe\u00ad cific geographic locations. Such agree\u00ad ments may be negotiated for such period of time as the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) may determine to be necessary to meet identified special de\u00ad mands. (g) Regulation : Recommendations for change . The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) shall establish proce\u00ad dures for receiving and processing rec\u00ad ommendations for changes to this regu\u00ad lation from interested parties. (h) CHAMPUS claim forms. The Di\u00ad rector, OCHAMPUS (or a design\u00e9e) is responsible for the d\u00e9velopment and/or updating of all CHAMPUS elaim forms, application forms, information request forms, etc., necessary in the administra\u00ad tion of the CHAMPUS Program as set forth in this Regulation, the CHAMPUS Operating Manual, or such other imple\u00ad menting instructions, procedures, etc., as may be issued. (i) CHAMPUS handbook. The Direc\u00ad tor, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) shall develop a Program document designated as the ' \"CHAMPUS Handbook\". Such \"CHAMPUS Handbook\" shall be the of- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1477 fidai summary of this Regulation. The \"CHAMPUS Handbook\" shall be updated at least every 2 years, as of January 1. (j) Program integrity. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) shall Over\u00ad see all CHAMPUS personnel, tors, providers validation Program's op\u00ad this regula\u00ad tion. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), shall accomplish this by means of proper delegation of authority, separation of responsibilities, establish\u00ad ment of reports, performance evalua\u00ad tions, internal and external management and fiscal audits, personal or delegated reviews of Program responsibilities, tak\u00ad ing affidavits, exchange of information among state and Federal governmental agencies, insurers, providers and associ\u00ad ations of providers, and such other means as may be appropriate to the cir\u00ad cumstances. Compliance with this regu\u00ad lation shall include compliance with spe\u00ad cific contracts and agreements, regard\u00ad less of form, as well as general instruc- .tions, such as the CHAMPUS Operating Manual, and other instructions, proce\u00ad dures, criteria, etc. relating to Program operation. (k) Role of the CHAMPUS advisor (CA) . The CHAMPUS Advisor is ap\u00ad pointed (generally by the Commander of a Uniformed Services Medical Treat\u00ad ment Facility) to service as an advisor to patients and staff in matters involving CHAMPUS. The CHAMPUS Advisor may assist beneficiaries (or sponsors) in ap\u00ad plying for CHAMPUS benefits, in the preparation of claims and otherwise as\u00ad sist beneficiaries in their relations with OCHAMPUS and CHAMPUS Contrac\u00ad tors. However, the CHAMPUS Advisor is not responsible for CHAMPUS policies and procedures and has no authority to make benefit determinations or obligate Government funds. Advice given to ben\u00ad eficiaries as to determination of bene\u00ad fits or level of payment is not binding on OCHAMPUS or CHAMPUS Contrac\u00ad tors. (l) Cooperation and Exchange of In \u00ad formation with Other Federal Programs. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a desig\u00ad nee) , will disclose to appropriate officers employees of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare: (1) Investigation for Fraud. The name and address of any physician or other individual being actively investi\u00ad gated for possible fraud in connection with CHAMPUS, and the nature of such suspected fraud. An active investigation exists when there is significant evidence supporting an initial complaint but there is need for further investigation. (2) Unnecessary Services. The name and address of any provider of medical services, organization, or other person found, after consultation with an appro\u00ad priate professional association or appro\u00ad priate peer review body, to have provided imnecessary services. Such information wm be released only for the purpose of conducting an investigation or prosecu- for the administration of Titles A vu i and X IX of the Social Security ct, provided that the information willRULES AND REGULATIONS be released only to the agency's enforce\u00ad ment branch and that the agency will preserve the confidentiality of the infor\u00ad mation received and will not disclose such information for other than Pro\u00ad gram purposes. (m) Disclosure of Information to the Public. Records and information ac\u00ad quired in the administration of CHAMPUS are records of the Depart\u00ad ment of Defense and may be disclosed in accordance with 32 CFR Parts 286, 286a, 286b, and 297, which constitute the ap\u00ad plicable Departmental Directives imple\u00ad menting the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. (n) Transitional Authority. It is rec\u00ad ognized that there will be a transitional period after the effective date of this Regulation during which full implemen\u00ad tation of all its provisions is accom\u00ad plished. To facilitate such transitional implementation, and notwithstanding any other provisions of this Regulation, the Director, ^OCHAMPUS (or a desig\u00ad nee) is granted the following transi\u00ad tional authority: (1) Basic Program Benefits. Basie Program benefits (refer to \u00a7 199.10) being provided for continuing inpatient care as of the effective date of this regu\u00ad lation, which are not authorized under this regulation, may continue in effect for a reasonable period of time except that in no event shall such transitional benefits continue beyond ninety (90) days after the date of notification to the beneficiary (or sponsor) and provider that such benefits will no longer be pay\u00ad able. (2) Program for the Handicapped Benefits. Program for the Handicapped benefits (refer to \u00a7 199.11) being pro\u00ad vided for continuing;inpatient care as of the effective date of this regulation which are not authorized under this regulation, may continue in effect for a reasonable period of time except that in no event shall such transitional bene\u00ad fits continue beyond 90 days after the date of notification to the beneficiary (or sponsor) and provider that such benefits will no longer be payable, or June 30, 1977, whichever occurs later. (3) Application of Required Rules and Procedures.

In those circum\u00ad stances where an active duty member is also the dependent of - another active duty member, a retiree or a deceased ac\u00ad tive duty member or retiree, \"Dual Coverage,\" i.e., entitlement to direct care from the Uniformed Services Medical Care System and CHAMPUS is the re\u00ad sult. Since the active duty status is pri\u00ad mary and it is th\u00e8 intent that all medical care be provided an active duty member through the Uniformed Services Medical Care System, CHAMPUS eligibility in such \"Dual Coverage\"' situations is there\u00ad fore terminated as of 12:01 a.m. on the day following the day Dual Coverage commences. (However, any dependent children in a marriage of two active duty persons or an active duty member and a retiree, are CHAMPUS eligible in the same manner as dependent children of a marriage involving only one CHAMPUS sponsor.) Should a spouse or dependent in such a dual coverage situation leave active duty status, that person's CHAMPUS eligibility is reinstated as of 12:01 a.m. of the day active duty ends, if he or she is otherwise eligible as a dependent of a CHAMPUS sponsor. (e) Changes in and termination of eligibility \u2014 (1) Changes in Status of Ac\u00ad tive Duty Member. When an active duty member's period of active duty ends (for any reason other than retirement or death), his or her dependents lose their eligibility as of 12:01 a.m. of the day fo l\u00ad lowing the day the active duty ends. Entitlement to CHAMPUS benefits also ceases as of 12:01 a.m. of the day fol\u00ad lowing the day a member is placed in desertion status. The member's depend\u00ad ent regains eligibility when the member is returned to military control. A mem\u00ad ber serving a sentence of confinement in conjunction with a sentence of a puni\u00ad tive discharge, is still considered on ac\u00ad tive duty until such time as the discharge is executed. (2) Change in status of retiree. Should a retiree cease to be entitled to retired, retainer, or equivalent pay for any reason, that person and his or her dependents lose their eligibility as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day the retiree ceases to be entitled to such pay unless such persons are otherwise eligible. A retiree who simply waives his or her retired, retainer or equivalent pay is still considered a retiree for the pur\u00ad poses of CHAMPUS eligibility. (3) Change in status of dependent \u2014 (i) Divorce. A spouse separated from an active duty member or retiree by a final divorce decree loses all eligibility based on his or her former marital relation\u00ad ship as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day the divorce becomes final. The eligibility of the member's or retiree's own children (including adopted and eligible illegitimate children) is unaf\u00ad fected by the divorce. An unadopted step\u00ad child, however, loses eligibility with the FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17986 termination of the marriage, also as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day the divorce becomes final. (ii) Annulment. A spouse whose mar\u00ad riage to an active duty member or retiree is dissolved by annulment loses eligibility as of 12:01 am. of the day following the date the court grants the annulment or\u00ad der. The fact that the annulment le\u00ad gally declares the entire marriage void from its inception does not affect the termination date of CHAMPUS eligibil\u00ad ity. In the unusual situation where there are children, the eligibility of the mem\u00ad ber's or retiree's own children (including adopted and eligible illegitimate chil\u00ad dren) is unaffected by the annulment. An unadopted stepchild, however, loses eligibility with the annulment of the marriage, also as o f 12:01 am., on the day following the day the court grants the annulment order. (iii) Adoption. A child of an active duty member or retiree who is adopted by a person other than a person whose dependents are eligible for CHAMPUS benefits, while the active duty member or retiree is living, thereby severing the legal relationship between the child and the sponsor, loses eligibility as of 12:01 am. of the day following the day the adoption becomes final. However, an adoption occurring after the death of an active duty member or retiree would not result in loss of the child's eligibility, since there would be no termination of the legal relationship between the child and the deceased sponsor. <iv) Marriage of child. A child of an active duty member or retiree who mar\u00ad ries a person whose dependents are not eligible for CHAMPUS, loses eligibility, as of 1 2.: 01 a.m. on the day following the day of the marriage. However, should the marriage be terminated, by death, divorce, or annulment before the child is 21 years of age, the child again becomes a CHAMPUS eligible dependent (as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day of the occurrence which terminates the marriage) and continues up to age 21, if the child does not remarry before that time. If the marriage terminates after the child's twenty-first (21st> birthday there is no reinstatement of CHAMPUS eligibility unless based on other entitle\u00ad ment. (v) Marriage of widow or widower. The remarriage of a widow or widower of an active duty member or retiree to a person whose dependents are not eligi\u00ad ble for CHAMPUS terminates his or her CHAMPUS eligibility as of 12:01 am. of the day following the day of marriage. Even if such remarriage should termi\u00ad nate for any reason, CHAMPUS bene\u00ad fits cannot be reinstated. However, the child of the widow or widower who was the stepchild of the deceased active duty member or retiree at the time of death continues to have CHAMPUS eligibility in the same manner as other classes of dependent children. (vi) Attainment of entitlement to hospital insurance benefits (Part A) un\u00ad der Medicare. Retirees and all other CHAMPUS eligible persons except de\u00ad pendents of active duty members loseRULES AND REGULATIONS their eligibility for CHAMPUS if, upon reaching age 65, or because of disability or chronic renal disease, they become en\u00ad titled to Hospital Insurance Benefits (Part A) of Medicare. This is true even though the persons attaining such status live outside the United States where Medicare benefits are not available. (a) Loss of CHAMPUS Eligibility. Age 65. All CHAMPUS beneficiaries, ex- cept ciependents of active duty members, automatically lose CHAMPUS eligibility at age 65 on the assumption that they have become eligible for Medicare. If the person is not entitled to Part A of Medi\u00ad care, he or she must file a Social Secu\u00ad rity Administration \"Notice of Disal\u00ad lowance\" certifying to that fact with the Uniformed Service responsible for the is\u00ad suance of his or her identification card so a new card showing CHAMPUS eligi\u00ad bility can be issued. (b) Loss of CHAMPUS elgibility: Chronic renal disease and disability \u2014 (i) Chronic renal disease. Medicare cov\u00ad erage begins with the third (3rd) month after the month a course of maintenance dialysis begins, or with the month in which a patient enters the hospital to prepare to receive a transplant (provid\u00ad ing the transplant is performed that month or the next month), whichever occurs sooner. All beneficiaries, except dependents of active duty members, lose their CHAMPUS eligibility when Medicare coverage becomes available to a person because of chronic renal disease. Example. I i a course of dialysis began on January 1, Medicare coverage would be effec\u00ad tive on April 1. If Uie course of maintenance dialysis began on January 31, Medicare coverage would still be effective April 1. (it) Disability. Each case relating to Medicare eligibility resulting from being disabled requires individual investiga\u00ad tion. All beneficiaries, except dependents of active duty members, lose their CHAMPUS eligibility when Medicare coverage becomes available to a disabled person. (c) Reinstatement of CHAMPUS eligibility. \u2014 (i) Over Age 65. Benefici\u00ad aries who lose their CHAMPUS eligibility because they reached age 65 and were eligible for Part A cannot be reinstated under CHAMPUS. (ii) Chronic renal disease\\ Medicare eligibility ceases for chronic renal disease patients twelve (12) months after the month in which a successful kidney transplant takes place or in which the course of maintenance dialysis ends. At this point CHAMPUS eligibility resumes if the person is otherwise still eligible. He or she is required to take action to be reinstated as a CHAMPUS beneficiary and to obtain a new identification card indicating renewed eligibility for civilian^ Uniformed Services medical care. Note.\u2014If a transplant should fail later than 12 months after surgery, the CHAMPUS beneficiary/patient must undergo another 3 month period of outpatient maintenance dialysis, at which time CHAMPUS benefits will again cease and Medicare eligibility be reestablished. (iii) Disability. Some disabilities are permanent, others temporary. Each casemust be reviewed individually. Where disability ends and Medicare eligibility ceases, CHAMPUS eligibility resumes if the person is otherwise still eligible. Again, he or she is required to take ac\u00ad tion to obtain a new CHAMPUS identifi\u00ad cation card. (d) Other Medicare entitlement. En\u00ad titlement only to Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B) of Medicare, but not Part A, or to Part A through the Premi- um-HI provision (provided for under the 1972 Amendments to the Social Security Act), does not affect CHAMPUS eligibil\u00ad ity for any class of beneficiary. The only impact relates to double coverage. (Refer to \u00a7 199.14, \"Double Coverage.\" ) (vii) Disabling illness or injury of child age 21 or 22 who has eligibility based on his or her student status. A child 21 or 2 2 years of age who is pursuing a full-time course of higher education and who either during the school year or between semesters suffers a disabling illness or injury with resultant inability to resume attendance at the institution, remains el\u00ad igible for CHAMPUS medical benefits for 6 months after the disability is re\u00ad moved or until the student passes his or her twenty-third (23rd) birthday, whichever occurs first. However, if recovery occurs before the twenty- third (23rd) birthday and there is resumption of a full-time course of higher education, CHAMPUS benefits can be continued until the twenty- third (23rd) birthday. The normal vacation periods during an estab\u00ad lished school year do not change the eligibility status of a dependent child 2 1 or 22 years of age in full-time student status. Unless an incapacitating condi\u00ad tion existed prior to, and at the time of, a dependent child's twenty-first (21st) birthday, a dependent child 21 or 2 2 years of age in student status does not have eligibility related to mental or physical incapacity as described in para\u00ad graph (b) (2) (iii) (c) (ii) of this section. (f) Actions required upon change in or termination of eligibility status. \u2014(1) Separation from active duty. \u2014 (i) DD Form 1407. Members being processed for separation or release from active duty,, including those being retired, must com\u00ad plete Section I, DD Form 1407 (Depend\u00ad ent Medical Care) and DD Form 1 1 7 3 (Statement), indicating whether they have a dependent receiving benefits un\u00ad der CHAMPUS. (ii) Actions required when d e p e n d e n t receives CHAMPUS benefits.\u2014 (a) R e \u00ad quirement to notify CHAMPUS offices. When the DD Form 1407 (or Form PHS 3209) .indicates that a member has a de\u00ad pendent receiving CHAMPUS benefits, the Commander processing the member will notify appropriate CHAMPUS oi- ficials as soon as posible but not later than the date of release. Notification is not required if the member simply trans\u00ad fers to another active duty status through reenlistment, commissioning, or other similar personnel action. (b) Contents of notification. The noti\u00ad fication, sent by message or other ex\u00ad peditious means, should contain the name and address of the dependent: the name, grade, service number, and social FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 17987 security number of the member; date of the member's separation or release from active duty; and the names and addresses of all known civilian providers of care. (c) CHAMPUS official to whom noti\u00ad fication is to be sent. (1) Notifications will, in every instance, be sent to the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). Notification will also be sent to OCHAMPUSEUR when care being pro\u00ad vided includes areas assigned to that office. (2) Desertion of active duty member. When an active duty member is adminis\u00ad tratively placed in a desertion status, the Commander responsible, if there is rea\u00ad son to believe that the member has a de\u00ad pendent receiving CHAMPUS benefits, will implement the notification proce\u00ad dure descriped in paragraph (f) (1) (ii) of this section, if the Commander has or can obtain the pertinent information. (3) Death of active duty member. Upon death of an active duty member, the organization Commander will imple\u00ad ment the notification procedure pre\u00ad scribed in paragraph (f) (1) (ii) of this section, if there is reason to believe that the member has a dependent receiving medical care from civilian sources. (4) Change in status of a dependent of active duty member. . When a Com\u00ad mander learns that a dependent of a member of the command is receiving CHAMPUS benefits and that the status of the dependent has changed so that the dependent is no longer entitled to such benefits, the notification procedures prescribed in paragraph (f) (1) (ii) of this section will be followed. (5) Termination of retiree status. When a retire^ ceases to be entitled to retired, retainer, or equivalent pay, the official responsible for making such a determination will notify CHAMPUS of\u00ad ficials as outlined in paragraph (f) (1) (ii) (c) of this section. The notification will include the name, grade, service number, social security number, and last known address of the retiree and the names and relationships of his or her dependents and their addresses of record. (g) Determination of eligibility sta\u00ad tus\u2014(l) Eligibility determination re\u00ad sponsibility of uniformed services. De\u00ad termination of a person's eligibility as & CHAMPUS beneficiary is the responsi\u00ad bility of the Uniformed Service of which the active duty member, retiree, or de\u00ad ceased member or deceased retiree is or was, a member, or in the case of de\u00ad pendents of a NATO military member, the service which sponsors the NATO member. For the purposes of Program mtegnty the appropriate Uniformed oervice shall, upon request of the Direc\u00ad tor, OCHAMPUS, review the eligibility determination of a specific individual or e -v5 i .ihere is reason to question the lgibmty status. In such cases a report n the rcsuit of the review and any ction taken will be submitted to the rector, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). pl^.l.^>roce(^ures for Procedures for \u00b0* Visibility of identifi\u00ad cation cards evidencing that eligibility men^rescri^e(i by the Department of Defense.

The gray colored DD Form 2 (with letter suffix denoting branch of service) (RET) (Identification Card) is the prescribed identification for retired members of all the Uniformed Services except the Commissioned Corps of the Public health Service when seek\u00ad ing benefits under CHAMPUS. The gray colored PHS-1866-3 (Ret) (Identifica\u00ad tion Card) is prescribed for retired mem\u00ad bers of the Public Health Service. . Note.\u2014The red colored DD Form 2 (Res) Identification and Privilege Card is not ac\u00ad ceptable identification for CHAMPUS. (2) Dependents. DD Form 1173 (Uni\u00ad formed Services Identification and Privi\u00ad lege Card) is prescribed for identifica\u00ad tion of dependents seeking benefits un\u00ad der CHAMPUS. Application for a DD Form 1173 will be made by submitting a DD Form 1172 (Application for Uni\u00ad formed Services Identification and Privi\u00ad lege Card) as prescribed by the appro\u00ad priate directive listed in paragraph (g) (2) of this section. It is incumbent upon each member and retired member to insure that his or her eligible depend\u00ad ents obtain and keep in their possession a DD Form 1173 and that a new DD Form 1173 be obtained prior to expiration date shown on the form for those dependents whose eligibility continues beyond that date. Note.\u2014DD Forms 1173 which do not have an affirmative entry in item 15b thereof, are not acceptable identification for CHAMPUS benefits. \u00a7 199.10 Basic program benefits. (a) General. The CHAMPUS Basic Program is essentially a supplemental Program to the Uniformed Services di\u00ad rect medical care system. In many of itsaspects, the Basic Program is similar to private medical insurance programs, and is designed to provide financial as\u00ad sistance to CHAMPUS beneficiaries for certain prescribed medical care obtained from civilian sources. (1) Scope of benefits. Subject to any and all applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, and/or exclusions specified or enumerated in this regulation, the CHAMPUS Basic Program will pay for medically necessary services and supplies required in the diagnosis and treatment of illness or injury, including maternity care. Benefits include specified medical services and supplies provided to eligible beneficiaries from authorized civilian sources such as hospitals, other author\u00ad ized institutional providers, physicians and other authorized individual profes\u00ad sional providers as well as professional ambulance services, prescription drugs, authorized medical supplies and rental of durable equipment. (2) Persons eligible for basic program benefits. Those persons eligible to receive the Basic Program benefits are as set forth in \u00a7 199.9, \"Eligibility,\" Any person determined to be an eligible CHAMPUS beneficiary is eligible for Basic Program benefits. (3) Authority to act for CHAMPUS - The authority to make benefit deter\u00ad minations and authorize the disburse\u00ad ment of funds under the Program is re\u00ad stricted to the Director, OCHAMPUS, designated OCHAMPUS staff, Director, OCHAMPUSEUR, and/or CHAMPUS Contractors. No other individuals or agents (such as physicians, staff mem\u00ad bers of hospitals, CHAMPUS Advisors, etc.) have such authority. (4) Status of patient controlling for purposes of cost-sharing. Benefits for covered services and supplies as de\u00ad scribed in this section will be extended on either an inpatient or outpatient cost-sharing basis, in accordance with the status of trie patient at the time the covered services and supplies were pro\u00ad vided, unless otherwise specifically desig\u00ad nated (such as for ambulance service or maternity care). For cost-sharing provi\u00ad sions, refer to paragraph (f) of this section. (5) Right to information. As a condi\u00ad tion precedent to the provision of bene\u00ad fits hereunder, OCHAMPUS and/or its CHAMPUS Contractors shall be en\u00ad titled to receive information from a physician or hospital or other person, institution, and/or organization (includ\u00ad ing a local, state or Federal Government agency) providing services or supplies to the beneficiary\" for which claims or request for approval for benefits are sub\u00ad mitted. Such information and records may relate to the attendance, testing, monitoring, or examination or diagnosis of, or treatment rendered, or services and supplies furnished to, a beneficiary and shall be necessary for the accurate and efficient administration of CHAM\u00ad PUS benefits. In addition, before a determination -on a request for pre\u00ad authorization or claim or benefits, a beneficiary (or sponsor) must provide particular additional information rele- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17988 vant to the requested determination when necessary. The recipient of such information shall in every case hold such records confidential except when: (i) Disclosure of such information is spe\u00ad cifically authorized by the beneficiary/ patient; <ii) disclosure is necessary to permit authorized Governmental officials to investigate and prosecute criminal actions; or (iii) disclosure is specifically authorized or required under the terms of the Privacy Act and/or Freedom of Information Act. (Refer to paragraph (m) of \u00a7 199.7, \"General.\" ) For the pur\u00ad poses of determining the applicability of and implementing the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 199.14 and 199.15, \"Double Coverage\" and \"Federal Medical Care Recovery Act\" respectively, or any provision of similar purpose of any other medical benefits coverage or entitlement, OCHAMPUS and/or CHAMPUS Con\u00ad tractors may, without consent or notice to any beneficiary (or sponsor), release to any person, organization, govern\u00ad mental agency, provider or other entity any information with respect to any beneficiary when such release constitutes a routine use duly published in the Federal Register in accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a). Before an individual's claim of benefits will be adjudicated, the individual must furnish to CHAMPUS that information which may reasonably be expected to be in his or her possession and which is neces\u00ad sary to make the benefit determination. Failure to provide the requested infor\u00ad mation may result in denial of the claim. (6) Physical examinations. The Di\u00ad rector, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) may require a beneficiary to submit to one or more medical (including psychiatric) examinations to determine the bene\u00ad ficiary's entitlement to benefits for which application has been made or for otherwise authorized medically neces\u00ad sary services and supplies required in the diagnosis and/or treatment of an illness or injury (including maternity). When a medical examination has been re\u00ad quested, CHAMPUS will withhold pay\u00ad ment of any pending claims (s) or action on any preauthorization requests for that particular beneficiary. If the bene\u00ad ficiary refuses to agree to the requested medical examination, or unless pre\u00ad vented by a medical reason acceptable to OCHAMPUS, the examination is not performed within 90 days of initial re\u00ad quest, all pending claim (s) for services and supplies will be denied. A denial of payment for services and/or supplies provided prior to (and related to) the request for a physical examination, is not subject to reconsideration. The medical examination (s )and required beneficiary travel related to performing the re\u00ad quested medical examination will be at the expense of CHAMPUS. The medical examination may be performed by a physician(s) in a Uniformed Services medical facility or by an appropriate civilian physician, as determined and selected by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), who is responsible for making such arrangements as are neces-RULES AND REGULATIONS sary, including necessary travel arrange\u00ad ments. (7) Timely filing of claims. All claims submitted for benefits Tinder this section must be filed with the appropriate CHAMPUS Contractor no later than December 31 of the calendar year im\u00ad mediately following the one in which the covered service or supply was rendered. Failure to timely file a claim automat\u00ad ically waives all rights to any benefits for such services and/or supplies. (Refer to \u00a7 199.13, \"Claims Submission, Review and Payment.\" ) (8) Double coverage: Third party lia\u00ad bility. Where double coverage exists or where there is third party liability, all claims submitted for benefits under this section are also specifically subject to the provisions of \u00a7 199.14 or statements (DD Form 12511. In some geographic loca\u00ad tions (or under certain special circum\u00ad stances) it is necessary for a CHAMPUS beneficiary to determine whether the re\u00ad quired medical care, (primarily non\u00ad emergency, inpatient care) can be pro\u00ad vided through a Uniformed Service facil\u00ad ity. If the required medical care cannot be provided the hospital commander (or a designee) will issue a Nonavailability Statement (DD Form 1251). Except for emergencies, a Nonavailability State\u00ad ment should be issued before medical care is obtained from a civilian source. Failure to secure such a statement may waive the beneficiary's rights to benefits under CHAMPUS. (i) Rules applicable to issuance of nonavailability statement (DD Form 1251). The Assistant Secretary of De\u00ad fense (Health Affairs ) is responsible for promulgating rules and regulations for the issuance of Nonavailability State\u00ad ments. Note.\u2014Applicable rules and regulations relating to Nonavailability Statements change, depending on the situation. For ex\u00ad ample, currently Section 750, Pub. L. 94-212 and Section 742, Pub. L. 94-419 relating to F T 76 and FY 77 respectively, restrict the use of CHAMPUS funds for payment of non\u00ad emergency civilian inpatient care if the re\u00ad quired care is available at a Uniformed Serv\u00ad ices hospital within a 40-mile radius of the patient's residence. Therefore, CHAMPUS beneficiaries who reside within a 40-mile radius of a Uniformed Services hospital must first seek non-emergency inpatient care in the Uniformed Service hospital. (ii) Beneficiary responsibility. The beneficiary is responsible for securing information as to whether or not he or she resides in a geographic area which requires obtaining a Nonavailability Statement. Information concerning cur\u00ad rent rules and regulations may be ob\u00ad tained from the Offices of the Army, Navy and Air Force Surgeon General, or a CHAMPUS Advisor, or the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), or from the appropriate CHAMPUS Contractor. (iii) Rules in effect at time civilian medical care is provided apply. The ap\u00ad plicable rules and regulations regarding Nonavailability Statements in effect at the time the civilian care is rendered FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRILapply in determining whether a Non\u00ad availability Statement is required. (iv) Nonavailability statement (DD Form 1251 ) must be filed with applica\u00ad ble claim. When a claim is submitted for CHAMPUS benefits-which includes serv\u00ad ices for which a Nonavailability State\u00ad ment was issued, the statement must be submitted along with the claim form. (10) Utilization review: Quality as\u00ad surance. Prior to the extension of any CHAMPUS benefits under the Basic Benefit Program as outlined in this sec\u00ad tion, claims submitted for medical serv\u00ad ices and supplies rendered CHAMPUS beneficiaries are subjected to review for quality and appropriate untilization. The-Director, OCHAMPUS (or a desig\u00ad nee) , is responsible for utilization review and quality assurance activities and shall issue such generally accepted standards, norms and criteria as are necessary to assure compliance. Such utilization re\u00ad view and quality assurance standards, norms and criteria shall include (but not be limited to) need for inpatient ad\u00ad mission, length of inpatient stay, level of care, appropriateness of treatment, level of institutional care required, etc. Implementing instructions, procedures and guidelines may provide for retro\u00ad spective, concurrent and prospective re\u00ad view, requiring both inhouse and ex\u00ad ternal review capability on the part of both CHAMPUS Contractors and OCHAMPUS. (11) Implementing instructions. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), shall issue a CH\u00c0MPUS Operating Man\u00ad ual and such other instructions, proce\u00ad dures, guidelines, standards and/or cri\u00ad teria as may be necessary to implement the intent of this regulation. (b) Institutional benefits \u2014 (1) Gen\u00ad eral. Benefits may be extended for those covered services and supplies described in paragraph (b) of this Section pro\u00ad vided by a hospital or other authorized institutional provider (as set forth in \u00a7 199.12 \"Authorized Providers\" ) , when such services and supplies are ordered, directed and/or prescribed by a physi\u00ad cian and provided in accordance with good medical practice and established standards of quality. Such benefits are subject to any and all applicable defini\u00ad tions, conditions, limitations, exceptions and/or exclusions as may be otherwise set forth in this or other sections of this Regulation. (i) Billing practices. To be considered for benefits under this section, covered services and supplies must be provided and billed for by a hospital or other au\u00ad thorized institutional provider. Such billings must be fully itemized and suf\u00ad ficiently descriptive to the satisfaction of CHAMPUS. In the case of continuous care, claims should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS Contractor at least every 30 days (i.e., monthly) either by the beneficiary (or sponsor) or on a participating basis, directly by the fa\u00ad cility on behalf of the Except for ad\u00ad missions to authorized institutions which 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 17989 qualify as hospitals, infirmaries or Chris\u00ad tian Science Sanitoriums (in the event CHAMPUS benefits again become avail\u00ad able for the latter type of institution), in order for benefits to be extended for otherwise covered services and/or sup\u00ad plies, preauthorization is required. (a) Admissions to Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs ). A preauthorization re\u00ad quest for transfer or initial admission to a skilled nursing facility is processed by the CHAMPUS Contractor serving the area where the skilled nursing facility is located. Wherever possible the preau\u00ad thorization request should be submitted prior to admission to a SNF. However, the beneficiary/patient (or sponsor) has up to 10 days after such admission in which to submit the request along with a treatment plan. If the stay in the skilled nursing facility is determined to be ap\u00ad propriate under the provisions of this regulation, benefits will be extended retroactive to the date of admission to the facility. If the stay in the skilled nursing facility is determined not to qualify under the provisions of this regu\u00ad lation, benefits will be denied as of the date of notice of such denial. (b) Admissions to authorized institu\u00ad tions requiring preauthorization (other than Skilled Nursing Facilities ). A pre- authorization request for admission to an institution which requires such pre- authorization (other than a skilled nurs\u00ad ing facility) is processed by OCHAMPUS. If the beneficiary (or sponsor) elects to proceed with such an admission prior to receiving written authorization from OCHAMPUS, authorization may be sub\u00ad sequently requested. However, if the stay related to subsequent request for au\u00ad thorization is determined to be appro\u00ad priate (in whole or in part) under the provisions of this Regulation, benefits may be extended, but only retroactively to the date the preauthorization request was received at OCHAMPUS. (c) Initial preauthorization: Limited to 30 days. Initial preauthorization is limited to up to 30 days of inpatient care. The inpatient stay must continue to be reviewed and reevaluated. If so specified by CHAMPUS, such recertification proc\u00ad ess shall be repeated every 30 days, or at such other time period as may be deter\u00ad mined by OCHAMPUS, for the purpose of determining the appropriateness of care and whether or not the case con\u00ad tinues to be eligible for benefits. (d) Other preauthorization require\u00ad ments. (f) An approved pr\u00e8authoriza- tion must specify the services and/or supplies the approval covers. (2) An approved preauthorization is valid for only 90 days from date of issuance. (3) If the preauthorized services and/ on S J ^ ^ es . are no^ obtained within the so day period, a new preauthorization request is required. However, unless due to unusual medical circumstances, the fact that the initially preauthorized services and/or supplies were not ob\u00ad tained during the specified time limit shall require a very careful review of a new request. FEDERAL<4) Preauthorization is required for each admission to a skilled nursing facil\u00ad ity, even though related to an ongoing medical condition. (5) A preauthorization may set forth other special limits or requirements as indicated by the particular case and/or situation for which the preauthorization is being issued. Example. An approved preauthorization for placing a child in a Residential Treatment Center may require that the initial medical review (to determine the necessity for con\u00ad tinuing the stay) be made every 14 days. (6) All preauthorization requests are responded to in writing and notification of approval or denial is sent by certified mail to the beneficiary (or sponsor) and, where applicable, to the provider. Note.\u2014For otherwise covered admissions to Residential Treatment Centers for emo\u00ad tionally disturbed children (RTC's), the proximity of the facility to the residence of the parent(s) and/or guardian will be a con\u00ad sideration in whether or not the authoriza\u00ad tion will be granted. If there is a CHAMPUS- approved facility closer to the parents, admission to the closer facility may be recommended. (iii) Approved treatment plan. Except for an initial inpatient admission in those institutions which qualify as hos\u00ad pitals, preauthorization described in paragraph (b) (ii) of this section includes the submission of a detailed treatment plan. Such treatment plan is subject to approval in keeping with the CHAMPUS Operating Manual and such other in\u00ad structions, procedures or guidelines is\u00ad sued or caused to be issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), Preauthorization will not be granted unless the request for approval in\u00ad cludes a treatment plan. If the pre- authorization request involves transfer from a hospital, the medical records re\u00ad lated to the hospital stay should be sub\u00ad mitted along with the treatment plan. (iv) Long term hospital care. Even though the initial admission did not re\u00ad quire preauthorization, any hospital stay anticipated to continue over 30 days re\u00ad quires recertification as of the 30th day. In order for the recertification process to be accomplished, on or before the 21st day, a treatment plan must be submitted for review and evaluation, including copies of the medical record covering the previous period of hospitalization. When a treatment plan is approved, such ap\u00ad proval shall include a schedule of review and r\u00e9\u00e9valuation for recertification of the continuing inpatient stay at least 30 days (or as designated by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee) for the pur\u00ad pose of determining appropriateness of care and whether or hot the beneficiary's inpatient hospital stay continues to be eligible for benefits. Should review of the case indicate that the benefici\u00e2ry/patient is being institutionalized primarily in connection with any special studies or project and/or that the approved treat\u00ad ment plan has not been followed and/or that misinformation was provided and/or pertinent information was omitted for the purpose of receiving preauthoriza\u00ad tion, the beneficiary and provider shallbe immediately notified that benefits for the inpatient stay are being terminated. Benefits extended in error will be re\u00ad couped in accordance with the pro\u00ad cedures set forth \u00a7 199.13, \"Claims Submission, Review and Payment.\" (v) Beneficiary/patient (or sponsor ) and/or provider responsible for complete and timely request for preauthorization and/or submission of treatment plan. Although a provider may actually pre\u00ad pare and make the submission to CHAMPUS, it ultimately remains the re\u00ad sponsibility of the beneficiary (or spon\u00ad sor) to assure that any request for pre- authorization and/or submission of a treatment plan is made in a timely manner and in conformance with this Regulation.

If an appropriate lower level-care facility would be ade\u00ad quate but is not available in the general locality, benefits may be continued in the higher level care facility but CHAMPUS institutional benefit payments shall be limited to the reasonable cost that would have been incurred in the appropriate lower level care facility, as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS^ (or a desig\u00ad nee) . If it is determined that the.institu- tional care can reasonably be provided in the home setting, no CHAMPUS institu\u00ad tional benefits are payable. (viii) General or special education not covered. Services and supplies related to the provision of either regular or special education are not covered. Such exclu\u00ad sion applies whether a separate charge is made for education or whether it is in\u00ad cluded as a part of an overall combined daily charge of an institution. In the latter instance, that portion of the over\u00ad all combined daily charge related to edu\u00ad cation must be determined, based on the reasonable costs of the educational com\u00ad ponent, and deleted from the institu\u00ad tion's charges before CHAMPUS bene\u00ad fits can be extended. The only exception to this circumstance is when appropriate education is not available from or not payable by the cognizant public entity. Each such situation must be referred to the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a desig\u00ad nee) for a review and a determination of the applicability of CHAMPUS benefits.

Emergency medical services or other au\u00ad thorized medical care may be rendered by the Residential Treatment Center provided it is professionally capable of doing so and meets those standards re\u00ad quired by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). However, it is intended that a Residential Treatment Center should prim arily render those services and sup\u00ad plies directly related to treatment of the mental condition requiring the inpatient stay. (5) Extent of institutional benefits .\u2014 (i) Inpatient room accommodation \u2014 (a) Semi-private. The reasonable costs for room and board furnished an individual patient are payable for semi-private ac\u00ad commodations in a hospital or other au\u00ad thorized institution, subject to appropri\u00ad ate cost-sharing provisions. (Refer to paragraph (f) of this section.) A semi\u00ad private accommodation is a room con\u00ad taining at least two (2) beds but no maximum number. Therefore, if a room is publicly designated by the institution as a semi-private accommodation and contains multiple beds, it qualifies as semi-private for the purpose of CHAMPUS, (b) Private. A private room is a room with one ( 1 ) bed and which is designated as a private room by the hospital or other authorized institutional provider. The reasonable cost of a private room accommodation is covered only under the following conditions : . (l ) Where its use is medically requires and when the attending physician certi\u00ad fies that a private room is medically necessary for the proper care and treat\u00ad ment of a patient; and/or (2) When a patient's medical condi\u00ad tion requires isolation; or (3) When a patient (in need of im\u00ad mediate inpatient care but not requiring a private room) is admitted to a hospi a or other authorized institution whic has semi-private accommodations, u FEDERAt. REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 17991 at the time of admission, such accom\u00ad modations are occupied. (4) When a patient is admitted tc an acute care hospital (general or special) without semi-private rooms. (c) Duration of private room stay. The reasonable cost of private accommoda\u00ad tions will be allowed unde\u00ef the circum\u00ad stances described in paragraph (b) (5) (i) (b) of this section until the individ\u00ad ual's condition no longer requires the private room for medical necessity purposes and/or medical isolation rea\u00ad sons; or, in the case of the patient not requiring a private room, when a semi\u00ad private accommodation becomes avail\u00ad able; or, in the case of an acute care hospital (general or special) which does not have private rooms, for the dura\u00ad tion of an otherwise covered inpatient stay. (d) Hospital (except an acute care hospital, general or special ) or other authorized institutional provider without semi-private accommodations. When a beneficiary/patient is admitted to a hospital (except an acute care hospital, general or special) or other institution which has no semi-private accommoda\u00ad tions, for any inpatient day where the patient qualifies for use of a private room (as set forth in paragraphs (b) (5) (i) (b) (1) and (2) of this section), the reasonable cost of private accommoda\u00ad tions will be allowed. For any inpatient day in such a hospital or other au\u00ad thorized institution where the patient does not medically require the private room, the reasonable cost of semi-private accommodations will be allowed, such reasonable costs to be determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). (ii) Successive inpatient admissions. Successive inpatient admissions shall be deemed one (1) inpatient confinement for the purpose of computing the active duty dependent's share of the inpatient institutional charges, provided not more than 60 days have elapsed between the successive admissions. Successive in\u00ad patient admissions related to a single maternity episode shall be considered one confinement, regardless of the num\u00ad ber of days between admissions. For the purpose of applying benefits, successive admissions will be determined separate\u00ad ly for maternity admissions and admis\u00ad sions related to an accidental injury. (Refer to paragraph (f) of this section.) (iii) Nonavailability statement related to maternity care. If a beneficiary re\u00ad ceived services and supplies as a regis\u00ad tered inpatient from a hospital or other authorized institution, related to maternity care and/or the actual de\u00ad livery, without securing a required Non\u00ad availability Statement, -> CHAMPUS benefits are not available for any costs related to that maternity care. No t e.\u2014if it is anticipated that any part of the maternity care is to be obtained from a civilian source (even if the beneficiary plans to deliver on an outpatient basis), as soon as the pregnancy has been established, the beneficiary is encouraged to obtain a Non\u00ad availability Statement, if one is required in her geographic area. This will protect the beneficiary from incurring expenses in con\u00ad nection with unforeseen inpatient maternitycare without a required Nonavailability Statement. (iv) General staff nursing services. General staff nursing services cover all nursing care (other than that provided by private duty nurses), including but not limited to general duty nursing, emergency room nursing, recovery room nursing, intensive nursing care, and group nursing arrangements.

(v) Intensive care unit (ICU). An in\u00ad tensive care unit is a special separate unit of a hospital in which patients are concentrated, by reason of serious ill\u00ad ness, usually without regard to diagnosis. Special lifesaving techniques and equip\u00ad ment are regularly and immediately available within the unit, and patients are under continuous observation by a nursing staff specially trained and se\u00ad lected for the care of this type patient. The unit is maintained on a continuing rather than an intermittent or temporary basis. It is not a post-operative recovery room nor a post-anesthesia room. In some large or highly specialized hos\u00ad pitals, the ICU's may be further refined for special purposes, such as for respira\u00ad tory conditions, cardiac surgery, coro\u00ad nary care, bum care or neurosurgery. For purposes of CHAMPUS, these spe\u00ad cialized units would be considered ICU's if they otherwise conformed to the def\u00ad inition of an intensive care unit. (vi) Treatment rooms. Standard treat\u00ad ment rooms include emergency room, operating room, recovery room, special treatment rooms, and hyperbaric cham\u00ad ber and all related necessary medical stqff and equipment. In order to be rec\u00ad ognized for purposes of CHAMPUS, such treatment rooms must bfe so designated and maintained by the hospital or other authorized institution on a continuing basis.

(If such equipment is provided for use on an out\u00ad patient basis, the provisions of paragraph - (d) of this section apply.) (ix) Transitional use items. Under cer\u00ad tain circumstances, a temporary or dis\u00ad posable item may be provided by use be\u00ad yond an inpatient stay, when such item is medical necessary to permit or facili\u00ad tate the patient's departure from the hospital or other authorized institution or which may be required until such time as the patient can obtain a continuing supply; or in cases where it would be unreasonable or impossible from a med\u00ad ical standpoint to discontinue the pa\u00ad tient's use of the item at the time of termination of his or her stay as an inpatient. (x) Computer-assisted tomography scanning (CAT scanning ) diagnostic services. Use of both the \"general pur\u00ad pose\" whole (full) body, and the \" dedi\u00ad cated\" head (brain) CAT scanners to ex\u00ad amine the head, may be covered. Use of computerized tomography on parts of the body other than the head is not covered. <a) CAT scanner procedures must be consistent with the diagnosis and symp\u00ad toms, and performed after other appro\u00ad priate noninvasive and less costly means of diagnosis have been exhausted. (b) Further, benefits shall be extended only for those scanning procedures per\u00ad formed on a CAT scanner located in an acute general hospital, owned by such hospital and operated by the hospital staff, and, if applicable to the jurisdiction where located, approved by the regional health planning agency. (xi) Anesthetics and oxygen. Anesthet\u00ad ics and oxygen and their administration are considered a service and/or supply if furnished by the hospital or other au\u00ad thorized institution, or by others under arrangements made by the facility under which the billing for such services is made through the facility. * (6) Emergency Inpatient hospital services. In the case of a medical emer\u00ad gency, benefits can be extended for medi\u00ad cally necessary inpatient services and supplies provided to a beneficiary by a hospital, including hospitals which do not meet CHAMPUS standards, or com\u00ad ply with the provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act or satisfy other condi\u00ad tions herein set forth. In a medical emer\u00ad gency, medically necessary inpatient services and supplies are those services and supplies which are necessary to pre\u00ad vent the death or serious impairment of FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17992 tiie health of the individual, and which, because of the threat to the life or health of the individual, necessitate the use of the most accessible hospital available and equipped to furnish such services. The availability of benefits depend upon the three following separate findings and continue only so long as the emergency exists, as determined by medical consult\u00ad ants to the contractor and/or CHAM PUS. If the case qualified as an emer\u00ad gency at the time of admission, and the emergency is subsequently determined to no longer exist, benefits will be extended up through the date of notice to the beneficiary and provider that CHAMPUS benefits are no longer payable in that unathorized institutional provided. (i) Existence of medical emergency. A determination that a medical emer\u00ad gency existed with regard to the patient's condition; (ii) Immediate admission required.

(3) Extent of professional benefits \u2014 (i) Multiple surgery. In cases of multiple surgical procedures performed at the same time, benefits shall be determined as follows: (a) If such multiple surgical proce\u00ad dures are for related conditions (whether or not, in the case of cutting procedures, such care is performed through the same surgical opening or by the same surgical approach), benefits shall be limited to that part of the surgical care for which the greatest amount is payable under the applicable reimbursement method (refer to paragraph (e) of this section of this regulation, \"Authorized Provid\u00ad ers\") . For the purposes of CHAMPUS, all procedures performed through the same surgical approach shall be considered to be related conditions. (b) If the, multiple surgical proce\u00ad dures are for unrelated conditions, bene\u00ad fits shall be extended as follows: (1) One-hundred (100) percentum of the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable charge for the major surgical procedure; and (2) Fifty .

(ii) Different types of inpatient care: Concurrent. If a beneficiary receives in\u00ad patient medical care during the same admission in which he or she also re\u00ad ceives surgical care or maternity care, the beneficiary shall be entitled to the greater of the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable charge for either the inpa\u00ad tient medical care or surgical or mater\u00ad nity care received, as the case may be, but not both; except that the provisions of this paragraph (c) (3) (ii) shall not apply if such inpatient medical care is for a diagnosed condition requiring in\u00ad patient medical care not related to the condition for which surgical care or ma\u00ad ternity care is received, and is received from a physician other than the one rendering the surgical care or maternity care. No te.\u2014This provision is not meant to im\u00ad ply that in those situations where extra time and special effort are required due to post- surgical or post-delivery complications, the attending physician may not request special consideration for a higher than usual charge. (iii) Need for surgical assistance. Sur\u00ad gical assistance is payable only if it is medically necessary as determined by the primary surgeon. Further, in order for benefits to be extended for surgi\u00ad cal assistance service, the attending Physician (surgeon) may be required to certify in writing to the nonavailability of a qualified intern, resident or other house physician. When a claim is re-ceived for a surgical assistant involving the following circumstances, special re\u00ad view is required to ascertain whether the surgical assistance service meets the medical necessity and other require\u00ad ments of this paragraph (c) : (a) If the surgical assistance occurred in a hospital that has a residency pro\u00ad gram in a specialty appropriate to the surgery; (b) If the surgery was performed by a team of singeons; (c) If there were multiple surgical as\u00ad sistants; or (d) If the surgical assistant was a partner of or from the same group of practicing physicians as the attending surgeon. (iv) Aftercare following surgery. Ex\u00ad cept for those diagnostic procedures classified as surgery in this paragraph (c) of this section, and injection and needling procedures involving the joints, the benefit payments made for surgery (regardless of the setting in which it is rendered) include normal aftercare, whether the aftercare is billed for by the physician or other authorized individual professional provider on a global, all- inclusive basis, or billed for separately. The extent of normal aftercare for each surgical procedure is generally based upon local practice. (v) Cast and sutures: Removal. The benefit payments made for the applica\u00ad tion of a cast or of sutures normally covers the post-operative care including the removal of the cast or sutures. In in\u00ad stances when th\u00e9 application is made in one geographical location and the re\u00ad moval of the cast or sutures must be done in another geographical location, a separate benefit payment may be pro\u00ad vided for the removal. The intent of this provision is to provide a separate bene\u00ad fit only when it is impossible for the beneficiary to use the services of the pro\u00ad vider that originally applied the cast. Benefits are not available for the serv\u00ad ices of a second provider if those serv\u00ad ices could have reasonably been ren\u00ad dered by the individual professional pro\u00ad vider who initially applied the cast or sutures. (vi) Inpatient medical care: Concur\u00ad rent. If during the same admission a beneficiary receiver inpatient medical care (non-surgical, non-maternity) from more than one physician, additional ben\u00ad efits may be provided for such concurrent care if required because of the severity and complexity of the beneficiary's con\u00ad dition. Any claim for concurrent medical care must be reviewed before extending benefits in order to ascertain the medical condition of the beneficiary at the time the concurrent medical care was ren\u00ad dered. In the absence of such determina\u00ad tion, benefits are payable only for in\u00ad patient medical care rendered by the attending physician. (vii) Consultants who become the at\u00ad tending surgeon. In many instances, the surgical consultant assumes the case shortly following a consultation, becomes the attending physician, and performs the surgery. If the surgery is performed within 3 days of the date of the con-17993 sultation, by the same physician who performed the consultation, the consul\u00ad tation is then considered to be a part of the preoperative examination which is an integral part of the surgery and a sepa\u00ad rate benefit is not payable for the con\u00ad sultation. If more than 3 days elapse between the consultation and surgery (performed by the same physician), ben\u00ad efits may be extended for the consulta\u00ad tion, subject to review. (viii) Anesthesia administered by the attending physician. A separate benefit is not payable for anesthesia adminis\u00ad tered by the attending physician (sur\u00ad geon or obstetrician) or dentist, or by the surgical or, obstetrical or dental assistant. (ix) Psychiatric procedures. \u2014(a) Max\u00ad imum therapy per twenty-four (24)- Generally, CHAMPUS benefits are lim\u00ad ited to no more than one (1) hour of individual and/or group psychotherapy in any twenty-four (24) -hour period, in\u00ad patient or outpatient. However, for the purpose of crisis intervention only, CHAMPUS benefits may be extended for up to two (2) hours of individual psycho\u00ad therapy during a twenty-four (24) -hour period. (b) Psychotherapy: Inpatient. In ad\u00ad dition, if individual or group psycho\u00ad therapy, or a combination of both, is being rendered to an inpatient on an ongoing basis (i.e., non-crisis interven\u00ad tion), benefits are limited to no more than five (5) one-hour therapy sessions (in any combination of group and indi\u00ad vidual therapy sessions) in any seven (7) day period. (c) Review and evaluation: outpatient. All outpatient psychotherapy (group or individual) are subject to review and evaluation at eight (8) session (visit) intervals. Such review and evaluation is automatic in every case at the initial eight (8) session (visit) interval and at the twenty-four -(24) session (visit) in\u00ad terval (assuming benefits are approved up to twenty-four (24) sessions). More frequent review and evaluation may be required if indicated by the case. In any case where outpatient psychotherapy continues to be payable up to sixty (60) outpatient psychotherapy sessions, it must be referred to peer review before any additional benefits are payable. In addition, outpatient psychotherapy is generally limited to a maximum of two (2) sessions per week. Before benefits can be extended for more than two (2) outpatient psychotherapy sessions per week, peer review is required. (x) Physical therapy. To be covered, physical therapy must be related to a covered medical condition. If performed by other than a physician, the benefici- ary/patient must be referred by a physi\u00ad cian and the physical therapy rendered under the supervision of a physician. (a) Outpatient physical therapy is generally limited to a 60 day period, 2 physical therapy sessions per week, in connection with each medical condition. In order for CHAMPUS benefits to be extended for physical therapy rendered for a longer period of time than 60 days, FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17994 and/or for more than 2 sessions per week, submission by the attending physician of documentation as to medical necessity and the reasonably anticipated results of such therapy is required. (b) General exercise programs are not covered even if recommended by a physi\u00ad cian. Passive exercises and/or range of motion exercises are not covered except when prescribed by a physician as an integral part of a comprehensive program of physical therapy. (xi) Maternity care: Cost-sharing.. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, except paragraph (d) (3) (i) of this section \"ambulance,\" all other\u00ad wise covered services and/or supplies re\u00ad lated to a maternity case shall be cost- shared on the basis of the status (or in\u00ad tended status) of the maternity patient at the time of delivery (of other termina\u00ad tion of the pregnancy). (a) If the beneficiary plans that the delivery will be on an inpatient basis, all covered services and supplies directly re\u00ad lated to the maternity care shall be cost- shared as inpatient services, including the pre- and post-natal care. (b) If the beneficiary plans that the delivery will be on an outpatient basis, all covered services and supplies directly related to the maternity care shall be cost-shared as outpatient services, in\u00ad cluding the delivery itself. (c) When a patient plans an inpatient delivery, but delivers or otherwise termi\u00ad nates the pregnancy at home or enroute to the hospital or other authorized in\u00ad stitution, benefits will be extended as if the pregnancy had terminated on an in\u00ad patient basis. (d) When a patient plans an outpa\u00ad tient (home) delivery, but delivers or otherwise terminates in an inpatient set\u00ad ting, all covered services and/or sup\u00ad plies directly related to the maternity care shall be cost-shared on an inpatient basis providing that a Nonavailability Statement (DD 1251), if required, has been obtained. In the absence of a re\u00ad quired Nonavailability Statement, no benefits are payable. (e> If a beneficiary obtains a Non- availability Statement and receives any part of her prenatal care from a civilian provider, then moves to another geo\u00ad graphic location and subsequently deli\u00ad vers in a Uniformed Services hospital, the prenatal care received from the civil\u00ad ian source shall be cost-shared on an in- patient basis, inasmuch as it was related to an inpatient delivery. (/) In those maternity cases where complications arise during the term of the pregnancy (r\u00e9fer to paragraph (c) (3) (xii) of this section), which require active medical treatment, otherwise covered medical services and supplies directly related to the complication of pregnancy will be cost-shared on the same basis as the related maternity care. This special cost-sharing proviso is limited to a period not to exceed 6 weeks following termination of the pregnancy, at which time the regular cost-sharing rules apply. (Refer to paragraph (f) of this section.)rules And regulations (g) Other special situations which may arise requiring a determination of whether or not the maternity case should be cost-shared on an inpatient or out\u00ad patient basis shall be referred to the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), who shall make such determinations in keeping with the intent expressed in paragraph (c) (3) (xi) of this section. (xii) Complications of pregnancy. For the purpose of CHAMPUS the following have been determined to be complications of pregnancy when commencing or exacerbating during the term of the pregnancy. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), may determine what other conditions qualify under paragraph (c) (3) (i) of this section on the basis of individual consideration. (a) Cesarean delivery; hysterotomy. (b) Pregnancy terminating before expiration of 26 weeks, except a volun\u00ad tary abortion. (c) False labor or threatened mis\u00ad carriage. id) Nephritis or pyelitis of pregnancy. (e) Hyperemesis gravidarum. (/) Toxemia. (g) Aggravation of a heart condition or diabetes. (h) Premature rupture of membrane. (i) Ectopic pregnancy. (?) Hemorrhage. (k) Other conditions as may be deter\u00ad mined by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). No t e.\u2014Postpartum psychosis (as its name implies), does not occur during the term of th^e pregnancy and therefore for the purposes of CHAMPUS does not qualify as a complica\u00ad tion of pregnancy. No t e.\u2014The special maternity cost sharing rules set forth in paragrdfh (c)(3 ) (xi) and (xii) of this section, shall also be applied where appropriate to services and/or supplies set forth under other paragraphs of this sec\u00ad tion, except for paragraph (d) (3) (v) of this section. (xiii) Nonavailability statements re\u00ad lated .to maternity. When a beneficiary resides in an area where Nonavailability Statements are required and receives in\u00ad patient maternity care from a civilian source without having secured the re\u00ad quired Nonavailability Statement, CHAMPUS benefits are not available for any services and supplies related to that maternity case. Note.\u2014If it is anticipated that any part of the maternity care is expected to be obtained from a civilian source (even if the beneficiary plans to deliver on an outpatient basis), as soon as the pregnancy has been established, the beneficiary is encouraged to obtain a Non\u00ad availability Statement, if one is required in her geographic area. This wiU protect the beneficiary from incurring expenses in con\u00ad nection with unforeseen inpatient maternity care without having obtained a Nonavail\u00ad ability -Statement. (xiv) Private duty (special ) nursing. Benefits are available for the skilled nursing services rendered by a private duty (special) nurse to an individual beneflciary/patient requiring intensified skilled nursing services, which can only be provided with the technical profi\u00ad ciency and scientific skills of an R.N. Thespecific skilled nursing services being rendered are controlling, not the condi\u00ad tion of the patient nor the professional status of the privates duty (special) nurse rendering the services. (a) Inpatient private duty (special) nursing services are limited to those ren\u00ad dered to an inpatient in a hospital which does not have an intensive Gare unit. In addition, under certain circumstances, private duty (special) nursing in the home setting is also covered. (b) The private duty (special) nurs\u00ad ing care must be ordered and certified to be medically necessary by the attending physician. (c) The skilled , nursing care must be rendered by a private duty (special) nurse who is not a member of the imme\u00ad diate family or is not a member of the benefiiciary/patient's household. (d) Private duty (special) nursing care does not, except incidentally, in\u00ad clude services which primarily provide and/or support the. essentials of daily living, or involve acting as a companion or sitter. (e) If the private duty (special) nurs\u00ad ing care services being performed are primarily those which could be rendered by the average adult with minimal in\u00ad struction and/or supervision, the services would not qualify as covered private duty (special) nursing services regard\u00ad less of whether performed by an R.N., regardless of whether or not ordered and certified to by the attending physician, and regardless of the condition of the patient. (/) In order for such services to be considered for benefits, a private duty (special) nurse is required to maintain detailed daily nursing notes, whether the case involves inpatient nursing service or nursing services rendered in the home setting. (g) Claims for continuing private duty (special) nursing care should be submit\u00ad ted at least every 30 days (i.e., monthly). Each claim will be reviewed and the nurs\u00ad ing care evaluated as to whether it con\u00ad tinues to be appropriate and eligible for benefits. (h) In most situations involving pri\u00ad vate duty (special) nursing care ren\u00ad dered in the home setting, benefits will be available for only a portion of the care, i.e., providing benefits only for that time actually required to perform medically necessary skilled nursing services. In the event that full time private duty (special) nursing services are engaged (usually for convenience and/or to pro\u00ad vide personal services to the patient), CHAMPUS benefits are payable only for that portion of the day during which skilled nursing services are rendered, but in no event is less than one (1) hour of skilled nursing care payable in any twenty-four (24) hour period during which nursing services are determined to have been rendered. Such situations are often better accommodated through use of visiting nurses. This allows the per\u00ad sonal services^ which are not coverable by CHAMPUS, to be obtained at lesser cost from other than an R.N. Skilled nursing FEDERAL R\u00ca\u00dbISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 17995 services provided by visiting nurses are covered. Note.\u2014Where the services of an R.N. are not available, benefits may be extended for the otherwise covered services of an L.P.N. or L.V.N. (d) Other benefits\u2014 i l ) General. Ben\u00ad efits may be extended for the reason\u00ad able charg\u00e9 of those other covered serv\u00ad ices and supplies described in this para\u00ad graph (d) which are provided in accord\u00ad ance with good medical practice and established standards of quality by those other authorized providers described in \u00a7 199.12, \"Authorized Providers.\" Such benefits are subject to any and all ap\u00ad plicable definitions, conditions, limita\u00ad tions, and/or exclusions as may be other\u00ad wise set forth in this or other sections of this regulation. In order to be con\u00ad sidered for benefits wider this paragraph (d), the described services or supplies must be prescribed and ordered by a physician. (2) Billing practices. To be considered for benefits under this paragraph (d ), covered services and supplies must be provided and billed for by an author\u00ad ized provider as set forth in \u00a7 199.12, \"Authorized Providers.\" , Such billing must be fully itemized and sufficiently descriptive, to the satisfaction of CHAMPUS. Whenever continuing charges are involved, claims should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS Contractor at least every 30 days (i.e., monthly), either by the beneficiary (or sponsor) or directly by the provider. (3) Other covered services and sup\u00ad plies\u2014 (i) Blood. If whole blood or plas\u00ad ma (or its derivatives) are provided and billed for by an authorized institution, in connection with covered treatment, benefits are extended as set forth in par\u00ad agraph (b) of this section. If blood is billed for directly to a beneficiary, ben\u00ad efits may be extended under this para\u00ad graph (d) in the same manner as a medical supply. (ii) Durable medical equipment. \u2014 (a) Rental. Rental of durable medical equip\u00ad ment (for the specific use of the bene- ficiary/patient) is covered: Provided, Such equipment meets the following criteria: (1) It must be medically necessary for the treatment of an illness or injury. (2) it must improve the function of a malformed, diseased or injured body part and retard further deterioration of the patient's physical condition. (3) It must be person-particular and cannot be an item which could be useful to any other person in the absence of illness or injury. (4) It must be primarily and custom\u00ad arily used to serve a medical purpose rather than primarily for transportation, comfort, or convenience. No te.\u2014A wheelchair is not considered to be primarily transportation in the sense of this paragraph (dj (3) (ii) (4) of this sec\u00ad tion. it qualifies as durable medical equip\u00ad ment under paragraph (d) (3) (ii) (2) of this * * * * * above, because by providing basic mobility it retards further deterioration of the patient's physical condition. Mobility' Beyond * that basic mobility provided by awheelchair is considered to be primarily transportation. For example, cart-type ve\u00ad hicles (such as the \"Amigo\" ) do not qualify as durable medical equipment. (5) It must withstand repeated use and will be provided on a one-at-a-time basis only; (based on the lifetime of the specific item of durable medical equip\u00ad ment) . (6) It must be other than spectacles, eyeglasses, contact lenses or other opti\u00ad cal devices, hearing aids or other com- munication devices. (7) It cannot be beyond the minimum level of performance and quality re\u00ad quired under the circumstances (i.e., non-luxury, non-deluxe). However, this is not intended to preclude a special fitting of equipment to accommodate a particular disability (such as fitting a wheelchair for a one-armed individual). (5) It must be ordered and/or pre\u00ad scribed by the attending physician. (9) It is not for a patient in a facility which provides or can provide such equipment. (10) It is not available for loan from a local Uniformed Services medical treatment facility. (11) The reasonable charge of the. item must be more than $100.00. (6) Lease/purchase. In those situa\u00ad tions where the lease/purchase of such durable medical equipment will be less costly to the CHAMPUS Program then continued monthly rental, lease/pur\u00ad chase arrangements will be entered into. Lease/purchase agreements must be limited in payments to the CHAMPUS- determined reasonable charge for the equipment with equal monthly pay\u00ad ments proportionate to the CHAMPUS- determined reasonable charge for monthly rental. Such agreements do not include ordinary time payment plans or revolving charge accounts. When lease/ purchase is authorized, benefits may also be extended for the reasonable charges related to the repair, replacement and adjustment of the purchased item of durable medical equipment. Durable medical equipment obtained through lease/purchase arrangements must meet the same criteria as rental items. (Refer to paragraph (d) (3) (ii) of this sec\u00ad tion.) (iii) Medical supplies and dressings (consumables'). Medical supplies and dressings (consumables) are those which do not withstand prolonged, repeated use. Such items must be directly related to an appropriate and verified covered medical condition of the specific beneficiary for whom the item was purchased, and ob\u00ad tained from a medical supply company, a pharmacy, or authorized institutional provider. Examples of' covered medical supplies and dressings are disposable syringes for a known diabetic, colos\u00ad tomy sets, irrigation sets, Ace bandages, etc. An external surgical garment spe\u00ad cifically designed for use following a mas\u00ad tectomy is considered a medical supply item. Note. \u2014Generally, the reasonable charge of a medical supply item will be under one hundred ($100.00) dollars. Any item in ex\u00ad cess of this amount must be reviewed tomake sure it would not qualify as an item of durable medical equipment. If it is, in fact, a medical supply item and does not represent an excessive charge, it can be con\u00ad sidered for benefit. (iv) Oxygen. Oxygen and equipment for its administration. Benefits are limited to providing a tank unit at one location, with oxygen limited to a 30 day supply. Repair and adjustment of CHAMPUS-purchased oxygen equip\u00ad ment is also covered. (v) Ambulance. Local professional ambulance service to, from and between hospitals when medically necessary and in connection with otherwise covered services and supplies and a covered medical condition. For the purpose of CHAMPUS, ambulance service is always an outpatient service (including in con\u00ad nection with maternity care). A profes\u00ad sional ambulance means a specifically designed and equipped land vehicle which contains at a minimum a stretcher, linens, first aid supplies, oxygen equipment and such other life\u00ad saving equipment required by state law or applicable local law, and manned by personnel trained to render first aid treatment. (a) Voluntary ambulances or such vehicles as medicabs and ambicabs do not qualify for benefits for the purpose of CHAMPUS. (b) Local service shall be that for which the reasonable charge does not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). Any professional ambulance service which exceeds that amount is considered long distance ambulance service and benefits are not available except as de\u00ad scribed in paragraph (d) (3) (v) (d) of this section. (c) Ambulance service cannot be used in lieu of taxi service and is not payable when the patient's condition would have permitted use of regular private trans\u00ad portation; nor is it payable when trans\u00ad port or transfer of a patient is primarily for the purpose of having the patient nearer to home, family, friends and/or personal physician. (d) Exceptional circumstances where the charge may exceed one hundred ($100.00) dollars and the ambulance service may still be considered for bene\u00ad fits under this section are limited to the following: (1) The patient is being transported from a rural or remote area to the nearest hospital for treatment; or (2) The patient is being transferred from one hospital which does not have the necessary facilities to treat the pa\u00ad tient, to the nearest hospital which does have the necessary facilities. (e) Air ambulance is specifically ex\u00ad cluded except if used under the specific circumstances set forth in paragraph (d) (3) (v) (d) of this section. Even under such circumstances, air ambulance must be medically necessary and utilized as a last resort. (vi) Prescription drugs and medicines. Prescription drugs and medicines which by law of the United States require a physician's or dentist's prescription and which are ordered or prescribed for by a FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17996 physician or dentist (except that insulin is covered for a known diabetic, even though a prescription may not be re\u00ad quired for its purchase) in connection with an otherwise covered condition or treatment, including Rhogam. (a) Drugs administered by a physician or other authorized individual profes\u00ad sional provider as an integral part of a procedure covered under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section (such as chemo\u00ad therapy) are not covered under this sub- paragraph inasmuch as the benefit for the institutional services or t\u00a3e profes\u00ad sional services in connection with the procedure itself also includes the drug used. (b) CHAMPUS benefits may not be ex\u00ad tended for drugs not approved by the Pood and Drug Administration for gen\u00ad eral use by humans (even though ap\u00ad proved for testing with humans). (vii) Phosthetic devices. The purchase of prosthetic devices is limited to arti\u00ad ficial limbs and eyes, except those items which are surgically inserted inside the body as an essential and integral part of an otherwise covered surgical pro\u00ad cedure are not excluded. No t e.\u2014In order for CHAMPUS benefits to be extended, any surgical Implant must be approved for use in humans by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (viii) Orthopedic braces and appli\u00ad ances. The attached shoes), arm braces, back braces and neck braces are covered. supports, etc., in\u00ad or regular shoes subse\u00ad quently built-up, are not covered. (e) Special benefit information. \u2014 (1) General. There are certain circum\u00ad stances, conditions and/or limitations which impact the extension of benefits and which require special emphasis and explanation. This paragraph (e) sets forth those benefits and/or limitation areas recognized to be in this category. The benefits and/or limitations herein described are also subject to any and all applicable definitions, conditions, limi\u00ad tations, exceptions and/or exclusions as set forth in this or other sections of this Regulation, except as may be otherwise specifically provided in paragraph (e) of this section. (2) Abortion. Benefits under the CHAMPUS Basic Program are available for otherwise covered services and sup\u00ad plies provided in connection with abor\u00ad tion, when legally performed in accord\u00ad ance with the applicable rulings of the United States Supreme Court in Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 170 (1973), Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and Planned Parent\u00ad hood of Missouri v. Danforth, -----U.S. ____, 96 S.C.T. 2831 (1976). No t e.\u2014Covered abortion services are limited to medical services and/Or supplies only and do not include abortion counseling or referral fees. (3) Family planning. It is considered essential that CHAMPUS-eligible fam\u00ad ilies have access to information and serv\u00ad ices that will allow freedom to choose the number and spacing of their chil-RULES AND REGULATIONS dren within the dictates of individual conscience. The scope of the CHAMPUS family planning benefit is as follows: (i) Birth control (i.e., contraception). \u2014 (a) Benefits provided. Benefits are available for services and supplies re\u00ad lated to preventing conception, including the following: (1) Surgical insertion, removal and/or replacement of, intrauterine devices. (2) Measurement for, and purchase of, contraceptive diaphragms (and subse\u00ad quent remeasurement and replacement). (3) Prescription oral contraceptives. (4) Surgical sterilization (either male or female). (b) Exclusions. The Family Planning benefit does not include the following: (f) Prophylactics (condoms). (2) Spermicidal foams, jellies, sprays, etc., not requiring a prescription. (3) Artificial insemination including any costs related to donors and/or se\u00ad men banks. (4) Reversal of a surgical sterilization procedure (male or female). (ii) Genetic testing. Genetic testing is essentially preventive rather than related to active medical treatment of an illness or injury. However, under the Family Planning benefit, genetic testing is cov\u00ad ered when performed in certain high risk situations. For the purpose of CHAMPUS, genetic testing includes tests to detect developmental abnormal- ties as well as purely genetic defects. (a) Benefits provided. Benefits may be extended for genetic testing performed on a pregnant beneficiary under the fol\u00ad lowing prescribed circumstances. The tests must be appropriate to the specific risk situation and must meet one of the following criteria: (1) The mother-to-be is 35 years of age or older; or (2) The mother and/or father-to-be have (has) had a previous child born with a congenital abnormality; or (3) Either the mother or father-to-be has a family history of congenital ab\u00ad normalities; or (4) The mother-to-be contracted ru\u00ad bella during the first trimester of the pregnancy; or (5) Such other specific situations as may be determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) to fall within the intent of this paragraph (e) (3) (ii). (b) Exclusions. It is emphasized that routine or demand genetic testing is not covered. Further, genetic testing does not include the following: (1) Tests performed to establish pa\u00ad ternity of a child. (2) Tests to determine the sex of an unborn child. (4) Alcoholism. Inpatient hospital stays may be required for detoxification services during acute stages of alcohol\u00ad ism when the patient is suffering from delirium, confusion, trauma, uncon\u00ad sciousness and severe malnutrition, and is no longer able to function. During such acute periods of detoxification and physi\u00ad cal stabilization (i.e., \"drying out\" ) of the alcoholic patient, it is generally ac\u00ad cepted that there can be a need for medi\u00adcal management of the patient; i.e., there is a probability that medical com\u00ad plications will occur during alcohol with\u00ad drawal, necessitating the constant avail\u00ad ability of physicians and/or complex medical equipment found only in a hos\u00ad pital setting. Therefore, inpatient hospi\u00ad tal care, during such acute periods and under such conditions, is considered rea\u00ad sonable and medically necessary for the treatment of the alcoholic patient and thus covered under CHAMPUS. Active medical treatment of the acute phase of alcoholic withdrawal and the stabiliza\u00ad tion period usually takes from 3 to 7 days. (i) Rehabilitative phase. An inpatient stay for alcoholism (either in a hospital or through transfer to another type of authorized institution) may continue be\u00ad yond the 3 to 7 day period, moving into the rehabilitative program phase. Each such case will be reviewed on its own merits to determine whether an inpa\u00ad tient setting continues to be required. Example. If a continued inpatient rehabili\u00ad tative stay primarily involves administration of antabuse therapy and the patient has no serious physical complications otherwise re\u00ad quiring an inpatient stay, the inpatient en\u00ad vironment would not be considered neces\u00ad sary and therefore benefits could not be ex\u00ad tended. (ii) Repeated rehabilitative stays: Limited to 3 episodes. Even if a case is determined to be appropriately continued on an inpatient basis, repeated rehabili\u00ad tative stays will be limited to 3 episodes (lifetime maximum); and any further rehabilitative stays are not eligible for benefits. However, inpatient stays for the acute stage of alcoholism requiring de- toxification/stabilization will continue to be covered. When the inpatient hospital setting is medically required, a combined program of detoxification/stabilization and rehabilitation will normally not be approved for more than a maximum of 3 weeks per episode. (iii) Outpatient psychiatric treatment programs. Otherwise medically necessary covered services related to outpatient psychiatric treatment programs for al\u00ad coholism are covered and continue to be covered even though benefits are not available for further inpatient rehabili\u00ad tative episodes, subject to the same psy\u00ad chotherapy review guidelines as other diagnoses. (Refer to paragraph (c) of this section; also refer to \u00a7 199.13, \"Claims Submission, Review and Pay\u00ad ment.\") (iv) Review Guidelines and Criteria. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a desig\u00ad nee) , will issue specific instructions, guidelines and criteria for review of claims for services and supplies related to alcoholism. (5) Organ transplants. CHAMPUS Ba\u00ad sic Program benefits are available for otherwise covered services and/or sup\u00ad plies in connection with an organ trans\u00ad plant procedure: Provided, Such trans\u00ad plant procedure is generally in accord\u00ad ance with accepted professional medical standards, and is not considered to be experimental. (i) Recipient costs. CHAMPUijJ bene\u00ad fits are payable for recipient costs when FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 the recipient of the transplant is a bene\u00ad ficiary, whether or not the donor is a beneficiary. (ii) Donor costs, (a) Donor costs are payable when both the donor and recipi\u00ad ent are CHAMPUS beneficiaries. (b) Donor costs are payable When the donor is a CHAMPUS beneficiary but the recipient is not. (c) Donor costs are payable when the donor is the sponsor and the recipient is a beneficiary. (In such an event donor costs are paid as a part of the bene- ficiary/recipient costs.) (d) Donor costs are also payable when the donor is neither a CHAMPUS bene\u00ad ficiary nor a sponsor, if the recipient is a CHAMPUS beneficiary. (Again, in such an event donor costs are paid as a part of the beneficiary/recipient costs.) (iii) General limitations, (a) If the do\u00ad nor is not a beneficiary, CHAMPUS bene\u00ad fits for donor costs are limited to those directly related to the transplant proce\u00ad dure itself and do not include any med\u00ad ical care costs related to other treatment of the donor, including complications. (b) In most instances, for costs related to kidney transplants, Medicare (not CHAMPUS) benefits will be applicable. (Refer to paragraph (e) (3) (vi) \"Eligi\u00ad bility\") (c) Donor transportation costs are ex\u00ad cluded whether or not the donor is a beneficiary. (d) Where the organ transplant is performed under a study, grant or re\u00ad search program, no CHAMPUS benefits are payable for either recipient or donor cost. (iv) Kidney acquisition. With specific reference to acquisition costs for kidneys, each hospital which performs kidney transplants is required for Medicare pur\u00ad poses to develop for each year separate standard acquisition costs for kidneys obtained from live donors and kidneys obtained from cadavers. The standard acquisition cost for cadaver kidneys is compiled by dividing the total cost of cadaver kidneys acquired by the number of transplants using cadaver kid\u00ad neys. The standard acquisition cost for kidneys from live donors is compiled similarly using the total acquisition cost of kidneys from live donors and the num\u00ad ber of transplants using kidneys from five donors. All recipients of cadaver kid\u00ad neys are charged the same standard ca\u00ad daver kidney acquisition cost and all re\u00ad cipients of kidneys from live donors are charged the same standard live donor ac\u00ad quisition cost. The appropriate hospital standard kidney acquisition costs (live donor or cadaver) required for Medicare must in every instance be used as the acquisition cost for purposes of providing CHAMPUS benefits,, (6) Eyeglasses, spectacles, contact lenses or other optical devices. Eye\u00ad glasses, spectacles, contact lenses or ?>Ter,,0ptical devices are excluded under the CHAMPUS Basic Program except under very limited and specific circum\u00ad stances. (i) Exception to general excliu enefit for glasses and lenses majRULES AND REGULATIONS extended only in connection with the following specified eye conditions and circumstances: (a) Eyeglasses or contact lenses which perform the function of the human lens, lost as the result of intraocular surgery or ocular injury. (b) \"Pinhole\" glasses prescribed for use after surgery for detached retina. (c) Lenses prescribed as \" treatment\" in lieu of surgery for the following conditions: (1) Contact lenses used for treatment of infantile glaucoma. (2) Corneal or scleral lenses pre\u00ad scribed in connection with treatment of keratoconus. (3) Scleral lenses prescribed to retain moisture in cases where normal tearing is not present or is inadequate. (4) Corneal or scleral lenses pre\u00ad scribed to reduce a corneal irregularity other than astigmatism. (ii) Limitations. The specified benefits are further limited to 1 set of lenses re\u00ad lated to one of the qualifying eye condi\u00ad tions set forth in paragraph (e) (6) (i) of this section. If there is a prescription change requiring a new set of lenses (but still related to the qualifying eye condi\u00ad tion), benefits may be extended for a second set of lenses, subject to specific medical review. (7) Transsexualism or hermaphrodi\u00ad tism. All services and supplies directly or indirectly related to transsexualism (or such other conditions as gender dysphoria) or hermaphroditism are ex\u00ad cluded under the CHAMPUS Program. This exclusion includes, but is not limited to, psychotherapy, prescription drugs, intersex surgery, etc., which may be pro\u00ad vided in connection with transsexualism or hermaphroditism. There is only one very limited exception to this general exclusion: notwithstanding the defini\u00ad tion of congenital anomaly, CHAMPUS benefits may be extended for surgery performed on a child ten (10) years of age or under to correct sex gender con\u00ad fusion (i.e., ambiguous genitalia). (8) Cosmetic , reconstructive and/or plastic surgery. For the purposes of CHAMPUS, cosmetic, reconstructive and/or plastic surgery is that surgery which can be expected primarily to im\u00ad prove physical appearance and/or which is performed primarily for psychological purposes and/or which restores form, but does not correct or materially im\u00ad prove a bodily function. No t e.\u2014If a surgical procedure primarily restores function, whether or not there is also a concomitant improvement in physical appearance, the surgical procedure does not fall within the provisions set forth in this section. (i) Limited benefits under CHAMPUS. Benefits under the CHAMPUS Basic Program are generally not available for cosmetic, reconstructive and/or plastic surgery. However, under certain limited circumstances, benefits for otherwise covered services and supplies may be provided in connection with cosmetic, reconstructive and/or plastic surgery, as follows :17997 (a) Correction of a congenital anom\u00ad aly; or (b) Restoration of body form follow\u00ad ing an accidental injury; or (c) Revision of disfiguring and exten\u00ad sive scars resulting from neoplastic sur\u00ad gery. (d) Generally, benefits are limited lo those cosmetic, reconstructive and/or plastic surgery procedures performed no later than December 31 of the year fol\u00ad lowing the year in which the related ac\u00ad cidental injury or surgical trauma oc\u00ad curred. However, special consideration for exception will be given to cases in\u00ad volving children, which may require a growth period. (ii) General exclusions, (a) For the purpose of CHAMPUS, dental congenital anomalies such as absent tooth buds, malocclusion, etc., are specifically ex\u00ad cluded. Also excluded are any procedures related to transsexualism or herma\u00ad phroditism, except as otherwise specifi\u00ad cally provided in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. (by Cosmetic,' reconstructive and/or plastic surgery procedures performed primarily for psychological reasons or as a result of the aging process are also ex\u00ad cluded. (c) In addition, whether or not they would otherwise qualify for benefits under paragraph (e) (8) (i) of this sec\u00ad tion, the breast augmentation mammo- plasty, surgical testicles and the implant proce\u00ad dure are specifically excluded. (iii) Non-cooered surgery: All related services and supplies excluded. When it is determined that a cosmetic, reconstruc\u00ad tive and/or plastic surgery procedure does not quality for CHAMPUS bene\u00ad fits, all related services and supplies are excluded, including any institutional costs. (iv) Preauthorization required. In order for CHAMPUS benefits to be ex\u00ad tended for cosmetic, reconstructive and plastic surgery procedures which might qualify under paragraph (e) (8) of this section, preauthorization is required from the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a des\u00ad ignee) . (a) Such preauthorization requests must Include full details of the proposed cosmetic, reconstructive and/or plastic surgery procedure, including photo\u00ad graphs of the defect to be surgically cor\u00ad rected. (b) When a preauthorization request is approved, it is for a specific surgical procedure and is valid for only 90 days from date of issuance. (c) If the approved cosmetic, recon\u00ad structive and/or plastic surgical proce\u00ad dure is not performed within the 90 day period, a new preauthorization is re\u00ad quired. (d) Preauthorization is required for each specific procedure even though a series of surgical procedures is related to the correction of one defect or condition (for example, one which requires that the corrective surgery be done in steps). A preautherization is not valid for any surgical procedure except as specifically stated in the preauthorization. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 17998 No t e.\u2014If a surgical procedure primarily restores function, whether or not there is a concomitant improvement in physical ap\u00ad pearance, there is no requirement for preau\u00ad thorization. However, if a-surgical procedure only marginally improves function or if there is any question on 4he part of the surgeon or beneficiary (or sponsor), OCHAMPUS should be contacted for a determination prior to performing the surgery. (v) Examples of non-covered cosmetic, reconstructive and/or plastic surgery procedures. The following is a partial list of cosmetic, reconstructive and/or plastic surgery procedures which Do Not Qualify for Benefits under CHAMPUS. This list is for example purposes only, and is not to be construed as being all-inclusive. (a) Any procedure performed for per\u00ad sonal reasons, to improve the appearance of an obvious feature or part of the body which would be considered by an average observer to be normal and acceptable for the patient's age and/or ethnic and/or racial background. (b) Cosmetic, reconstructive and/or plastic surgical procedures which are jus\u00ad tified primarily on the basis of a psycho\u00ad logical or psychiatric need. (c) Augmentation mammoplasties. (d) Face lifts and other precedures re\u00ad lated to the aging process. (e) Reduction mammoplasties (unless there is medical documentation of in\u00ad tractable pain not amenable to other forms of treatment, as the result of in\u00ad creasingly large, pendulous breasts). (/) Panniculectomy; body sculpture procedures. (g) Repair of sagging eyelids (without demonstrated and medically documented significant impairment of vision). (h) Rhinoplasties (without evidence of accidental injury occurring within the previous 6 months which resulted in sig\u00ad nificant obstruction of breathing). (i) Chemical peeling for facial wrinkles. (j ) Dermabrasion of the face. (k) Revision of scars resulting from surgery and/or a disease process, except disfiguring and extensive scars resulting from neoplastic surgery. (Z) Removal of tatoos. (m ) Hair transplants. (n) Electrolysis. (o) Any procedures related to Trans\u00ad sexualism or Hermaphroditism, except as specifically provided in paragraph (e) (7) of this section. (p ) Penile implant procedure, (q) Insertion or prosthetic testicles. (9) unfortunate Se\u00ad quelae) resulting from non-covered ini\u00ad tial surgery/treatment. Benefits are available for otherwise covered services and supplies required in the treatment of complications resulting from a non- covered incident of treatment (such as non-adjunctive dental care, transsexual surgery, cosmetic surgery, etc.)', but only if the subsequent complication repre\u00ad sents a separate medical condition such as a systemic infection, cardiac arrest, acute drug reaction, etc. Benefits may not be extended for any subsequent care or procedure related to the complication that is essentially similar to the initial non-covered care. Examples of complica-RULES AND REGULATIONS tions similar to the initial episode of care (and thus not covered) would be repair of facial scarring resulting from dermabrasion for acne or repair of a prolapsed vagina in a biological male who had undergone transsexual surgery. (10) Dental. The CHAMPUS Program does not include a dental benefit. Under very limited circumstances, benefits are available for dental services and supplies when the dental services are adjunctive to otherwise covered medical treatment. (i) Adjunctive dental care: Limited. Adjunctive dental care is limited to that dental care which is medically necessary in the treatment of an otherwise covered medical (not dental) condition, is an integral part of the treatment of such medical condition and is essential to the control of the primary medical condi\u00ad tion. (a) Elimination of a non-local oral infection (such as cellulitis or osteitis) which is clearly exacerbating and direct\u00ad ly affecting a medical condition currently under treatment would be an example of adjunctive dental care. (b) Another example of adjunctive dental care would be where teeth and tooth fragments must be removed in order to treat and repair facial trauma resulting from an accidental injury. Note. \u2014The test of whether or not dental trauma is covered is whether or not the trauma is solely dental trauma. Dental trau\u00ad ma must be related to, and an integral part of, medical trauma in order to be covered as adjunctive dental care. (11) General exclusions. Generally, preventive, routine, restorative, prostho- dontic and/or emergency dental care are not covered by CHAMPUS. (a) Dental care which is essentially preventive and (even if performed to prevent a potential medical condition) which is not an integral part of the treatment of a medical (not dental) condition, does not qualify as adjunctive dental care for the purposes of CHAM PUS. An example would be routine den\u00ad tal care provided a rheumatic heart pa\u00ad tient as a \"preventive\" measure. (b) Adjunctive care does not include dental services which involve only the teeth and/or their supporting structure, even if the result of an accident. An ex\u00ad ample would be the child who falls and breaks, chips or loosens a tooth. (c) Adjunctive dental care does not in\u00ad clude restoration or peridontal splinting of teeth and/or dental prosthesis, wheth\u00ad er permanent or temporary and whether required as a result of an accidental in\u00ad jury or whether injured, affected or frac\u00ad tured during the medical or surgical management of a medical condition. (d) Adjunctive dental care does not include treatment of peridontal disease and/or the consequence of peridontal disease; nor does it include such dental services as filling cavities or adding or modifying bridgework to assist in masti\u00ad cation whether or not related to gastro\u00ad intestinal or hematopoietic diseases. (e) All orthodontia is specifically ex\u00ad cluded, except when directly related to and as an integral part of, surgical cor\u00adrection of cleft palate congenital anomaly. (iii) Preauthorization required. dental care, in order to be cov\u00ad ered, requires prior approval and written preauthorization from the Director, OCHAMPUS (br a designee). (a) The preauthorization request must include a detailed statement -from the dentist as to the dental procedure to be performed and its cost, and a statement from the attending physician providing the medical evidence as to its relation\u00ad ship to a medical condition currently under treatment. (b) Such preauthorization is for spe\u00ad cific dental service and is valid for only 90 days from date of issuance. (c) If the approved adjunctive dental care is not rendered within the 90 day period, a new preauthorization is re\u00ad quired! However, unless some unusual medical circumstance occurs, the fact that the dental care was not rendered during the specified time limit will raise significant question as to whether it was, in fact, adjunctive. id) Preauthorization is required for each specific adjunctive dental service or appliance (i.e., each instance of dental care), even though related to an ongoing medical episode. A preauthorization is not valid for any adjunctive dental serv\u00ad ice or supply except as specifically stated in the preauthorization. (e) Where adjunctive dental care in\u00ad volves an emergency medical (not dental) situation (such as facial in\u00ad juries resulting from an accident), pre\u00ad authorization is waived. However, such waiver is limited to the essential ad\u00ad junctive dental care related to the medi\u00ad cal condition requiring the immediate emergency treatment. When claims are submitted for such adjunctive dental care rendered in an emergency situation, a complete explanation along with sup\u00ad porting medical documentation must be submitted. (iv) Covered oral surgery. Notwith\u00ad standing the above limitations on dental care, there are certain oral surgical pro\u00ad cedures which are performed by both physicians and dentists, and . which are essentially medical father than dental care. For the purposes of CHAMPUS, the following procedures, whether per\u00ad formed by a physician or dentist, are con\u00ad sidered to. be in this category and benefits may be extended for otherwise covered services and supplies without preauthor\u00ad ization: (a) Excision of tumors and cysts of the jaws, cheeks, lips, tongue, roof and floor of the mouth, when such conditions re\u00ad quire a pathological (histological) examination. (b) Surgical procedures required to correct accidental injuries of the jaws, cheeks, lips, tongue, roof and floor of the mouth. (c) Treatment of oral and/or facial cancer. (d) Treatment of fractures of facial bones. (e) External (extra-oral) incision and drainage of cellulitis. (/) Surgery of accessory sinuses, sali\u00ad vary glands or ducts. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 17929 (g) Reduction of dislocations of and the excision of the temporomandibular joints, when surgery is a necessary part of the reduction. (ft) Any oral surgical procedure which falls within the cosmetic, reconstructive and/or plastic surgery definition is sub\u00ad ject to the limitations and requirements set forth in paragraph (e) (8) of \u00a7 199.10, \"Basic Program Benefits\". No te.\u2014Preparation of the month for den\u00ad tures is not a covered oral surgery procedure. Also excluded are the removal of unerupted or partially erupted, malposed and/or im\u00ad pacted teeth, with or without the attached follicular or development tissues. (v) Inpatient hospital stay in connec\u00ad tion with nonadjunctive, non-covered dental care. Institutional benefits speci\u00ad fied in paragraph (b) of this section may be extended for inpatient hospital stays related to non-covered, non-adjunctive dental care when such inpatient stay is medically necessary to safeguard the life of the patient from the effects of dentist\u00ad ry because of the existence of a specific and serious non-dental organic impair\u00ad ment currently under active treatment. (Hemophilia is an example o'f a condi\u00ad tion that could be considered a serious non-dental impairment.) Preauthoriza\u00ad tion by OCHAMPUS is required for such inpatient stay to be covered in the same manner as required for adjunctive dental care described in paragraph (e) (10) (iii) (and its subparts) of this section. Re\u00ad gardless of whether or not the pre\u00ad authorization request for the hospital admission is approved and thus qualifies for institutional benefits, the profes\u00ad sional service related to the non-adjunc- tive dental care is not covered. (11) Drug Abuse. Under the CHAM\u00ad PUS Basic Program, benefits may be ex\u00ad tended for medically necessary prescrip\u00ad tion drugs required in the treatment of an illness or injury or in connection with maternity care (refer to paragraph (d) of this section). However, CHAMPUS benefits cannot be authorized to support and/or maintain an existing or potential drug abuse situation, whether or not the drugs (under other circumstances) are eligible for benefit consideration and whether or not obtained by legal means. (i) Limitations on who can prescribe drugs. CHAMPUS benefits are not avail\u00ad able for any drugs prescribed by a mem\u00ad ber of the beneficiary/patient's family or by a non-family member residing in the same household with the beneficiary/ Patient (or sponsor). CHAMPUS Con\u00ad tractors are not authorized to make any exception to this restriction. (ii) Drug maintenance programs ex\u00ad cluded. Drug maintenance programs where one addictive drug is substituted for another on a maintenance basis (such as methadone substituted for heroin) are not covered. Further, this exclusion applies even in areas outside the United States where addictive drugs are legally dispensed by physicians on a maintenance dosage level. (iii) Kinds of.prescription drugs which are carefully monitored by CHAMPUS for possible abuse situations.(a) Narcotics. Examples are are re\u00ad sponsible for implementing utilization control and quality assurance procedures designed to identify possible drug abuse situations. The CHAMPUS Contractor is directed to screen all drug claims for potential over-utilization and/or irra\u00ad tional prescribing of drugs, and to sub\u00ad ject any suGh cases to extensive review to establish the necessity for the drugs apd their appropriateness on the basis of diagnosis and/or definitive symp\u00ad toms. (a) When a possible drug abuse situ\u00ad ation is identified, all claims for drugs for that beneficiary and/or provider vider will be suspended pending the re\u00ad sults of a review. (b) If the review determines that a drug abuse situation does in fact exist, all drug claims held in suspense will be denied. (e) If the record indicates previous\u00ad ly paid drug benefits, the prior claims for that beneficiary and/or provider will be reopened and the circumstances involved reviewed to determine whether or not a drug abuse situation also ex\u00ad isted at the time the earlier claims were adjudicated. If drug abuse is subsequent\u00ad ly ascertained, benefit payments previ\u00ad ously made will be considered to have been extended in error and the amount paid recouped. (d) Inpatient stays primarily for the purpose of obtaining drugs and any other service and supplies related to drug abuse situations are also excluded. (v) Unethical or illegal provider prac\u00ad tices related to drugs. Any such investi\u00ad gation into a possible drug abuse situ\u00ad ation which uncovers unethical or illegal drug dispensing practices on the part of an institution or physician will be re\u00ad ferred to the professional and/or in\u00ad vestigative agency having jurisdiction. CHAMPUS Contractors are directed to withhold payment of all CHAMPUS claims for services and/or supplies ren\u00ad dered by a provider under active investi\u00ad gation for possible unethical or illegal drug dispensing activities. (vi) Detoxification. The above moni\u00ad toring and control of drug abuse situ\u00ad ations shall in no way be construed to deny otherwise covered medical serv\u00ad ices and supplies related to drug detoxifi\u00ad cation (including newborn addicted in\u00ad fants) when medical supervision is required. i_(12) , (Custodial care. The statute un\u00ad der which CHAMPUS operates specifi\u00ad cally excludes custodial care. This is a very difficult area to administer. Fur\u00adther, many beneficiaries (and sponsors) misunderstand what is meant by cus\u00ad todial care, assuming that because cus\u00ad todial care is not covered, it implies the custodial care is not necessary. This is not the case; denial of benefits only means the care being provided is not a type of care for which CHAMPUS benefits can be extended. (i) Definition of custodial care. Cus\u00ad todial Care is defined to mean that care rendered to a patient (a) who is men\u00ad tally or physically disabled and such dis\u00ad ability is expected to continue to be pro\u00ad longed, and (b) who requires a protected, monitored and/or controlled environ\u00ad ment whether in an institution or in the home, and (c) who requires assistance to support the essentials of daily living, and (d) who is not under active and specific medical, surgical and/or psychi\u00ad atric treatment which will reduce the disability to the extent necessary to en\u00ad able the patient to function outside the protected, monitored and/or controlled environment. A custodial care determi\u00ad nation is not precluded by the fact that a patient is under the care of a super\u00ad vising and/or attending physician and that services are being ordered and pre\u00ad scribed to support and generally main\u00ad tain the patient's condition, and/or pro\u00ad vide for the patient's comfort, and/or assure the manageability of the patient. Further, a custodial care determination is not precluded because the ordered and prescribed services and supplies are be\u00ad ing provided by a R.N. or L.P.N. (ii) Kinds of conditions that can result in custodial care. There is no absolute rule that can be applied. With most con\u00ad ditions there is a period of active treat\u00ad ment before custodial care, some much more prolonged than others. Examples of potential custodial care cases might be a spinal cord injury resulting in ex\u00ad tensive paralysis, a severe cerebral vas\u00ad cular accident, multiple sclerosis in its latter stages, or pre-senile and senile dementia. These conditions do not neces\u00ad sarily result in custodial care but are in\u00ad dicative of the types of conditions that sometimes do. It is not the condition itself that is controlling but whether the care being rendered falls within the defi\u00ad nition of custodial care. (iii) Benefits available in connection with a custodial care case. CHAMPUS benefits are not available for services and/or supplies related to a custodial care case (including the supervisory physician's care), with the following spe\u00ad cific exceptions: (a) Prescription drugs. Benefits are payable for otherwise covered prescrip\u00ad tion drugs, even if prescribed primarily for the purpose of making the person receiving custodial care manageable in the custodial environment. (by Nursing services: Limited. It is recognized that even though the care being received is determined to be pri\u00ad marily custodial, an occassional specific skilled nursing service may be required. Where it is determined such skilled nurs\u00ad ing services are needed, benefits may be extended for I hour of nursing care per day. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 18000 (c) Payment for prescription drugs and limited skilled nursing services does not affect custodial care determination. The fact that CHAMPUS extends benefits for prescription drugs and limi\u00ad ted skilled nursing services in no way affects the custodial care determination if the case otherwise falls within the def\u00ad inition of custodial care. (iv) Beneficiary recieving custodial care: Admission to a hospital. CHAM PUS Benefits may be extended for other\u00ad wise covered services and/or supplies di\u00ad rectly related to a medically necessary admission to an acute general or special hospital, under the following circum\u00ad stances : (a) Presence of another condition. When a beneficiary receiving custodial care requires hospitalization for the- treatment of a condition other than the condition for which he or she is receiv\u00ad ing custodial care (an example might be a broken leg as a result of a fa ll); or (b) Acute exacerbation of the condi\u00ad tion for which custodial care is being received. When there is an acute exacer\u00ad bation of the condition for which custo\u00ad dial care is being received which re\u00ad quires active inpatient treatment which is otherwise covered. * (13) Domiciliary care. The statute un\u00ad der which CHAMPUS operates also spe\u00ad cifically exludes domiciliary care. This is another area that is often misunder\u00ad stood by beneficiaries (and sponsors). (i) Defintion of domiciliary care. Dom\u00ad iciliary care is defined to mean inpatient institutional care provided the benefi\u00ad ciary, not because it is medically neces\u00ad sary, but because the care in the home setting is not available, is unsuitable and/or members of the patient's family are unwilling to provide the care. In\u00ad stitutionalization because of abandon\u00ad ment constitutes domiciliary care. (ii) Examples of domiciliary care situ\u00ad ations. The following are examples of domiciliary care for which CHAMPUS benefits are not payable: (a) Home care is not available. Institu\u00ad tionalization primarily because parents work, or extension of a hospital stay be\u00ad yond what is medically required because the patient lives alone, are examples of domiciliary care provided because there is no other family member or other per\u00ad son available in the home. (b) Home care is not suitable. Institu\u00ad tionalization of a child because a parent or (parents) is an alcoholic who is not sufficiently responsible to care for the child, or because someone in the home has a contagious disease, are examples of domiciliary care being provided be\u00ad cause the home setting is unsuitable. (c) Family unwilling to care for indi\u00ad vidual in the home. A child who is diffi\u00ad cult to manage may be placed in an insti\u00ad tution, not because institutional care is medically required, but because the fam\u00ad ily does not want to handle him or her in the home. Such institutionalization would represent domiciliary care, i.e., the family being unwilling to assume respon\u00ad sibility for the child. (iii) Benefits available in connection with a domiciliary care ease. Should theRULES AND REGULATIONS beneficiary receive otherwise covered medical services and/or supplies while also being in a domiciliary care situation, CHAMPUS benefits are payable for those medical services and/or supplies in the same manner as though the beneficiary resided in his or her own home. Such benefits would be cost-shared as though rendered to an outpatient. (iv) General exclusion. Domiciliary care is institutionalization essentially to provide a substitute home\u2014not because it is medically necessary for the bene\u00ad ficiary to be in the institution (although there may be conditions present which have contributed to the fact that domi\u00ad ciliary care is being rendered). CHAMPUS benefits are not payable for any costs/charges related to the provi\u00ad sion of domiciliary care. While a substi\u00ad tute home and/or assistance may be necessary for the beneficiary, domiciliary care does not represent the kind of care for which CHAMPUS benefits can be provided. (f) Beneficiary (or sponsor) liability. (1) General. As stated in the introduc\u00ad tory paragraph to this section, the CHAMPUS Basic Program is essentially a supplemental program to the Uni\u00ad formed Services direct medical care sys\u00ad tem. In order to encourage use of the Uniformed Services direct medical care system wherever its facilities are avail\u00ad able and appropriate, the CHAMPUS Basic Program benefits are designed so that it is to the financial advantage of a CHAMPUS beneficiary (or sponsor) to use the direct medical care system. When medical care is received from civilian sources, a CHAMPUS beneficiary is re\u00ad sponsible for payment of certain deduct\u00ad ible and cost-sharing amounts in con\u00ad nection with otherwise covered services and supplies. By statute, this joint finan\u00ad cial responsibility between the benefi\u00ad ciary (or sponsor) and CHAMPUS is more favorable for dependents of active duty members than for other classes of beneficiaries. (2) Dependents of active duty mem\u00ad bers of the Uniformed Services. CHAMPUS beneficiary (or sponsor) lia\u00ad bility set forth for dependents of active duty members is as follows: (i) Annual fiscal year deductible for outpatient services and/or supplies. A CHAMPUS beneficiary (or sponsor) is responsible for the payment of the first fifty ($50) dollars of the CHAMPUS- determined reasonable costs/charges for otherwise covered outpatient services and/or supplies provided in any one fiscal year. However, when such outpatient services are provided to more than one beneficiary member of a family during the same fiscal year, the aggregate out\u00ad patient deductible amount paid by any two or more beneficiary members of the family, who submit claims, shall not ex\u00ad ceed one hundred ($100) dollars during any fiscal year. Note.\u2014The Federal Government's current fiscal year runs from October 1 through Sep\u00ad tember 30 of each year. This fiscal year period became effective October 1, 1976. Prior to that time, the fiscal year period ran from July 1 through June 30 of each year. For pur\u00ad FEDERAL REGISTER,. VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRILposes of applying the CHAMPUS fiscal year outpatient deductible provision, the transi\u00ad tional quarter July 1, 1976 through Sep\u00ad tember 30, 1976, is considered to be a part of the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1975. Thus for the purposes of satisfying the annual fiscal year outpatient deductible, CHAMPUS beneficiaries have the advantage of a one\u00ad time 15-month fiscal year, running from July 1, 1975, through September 30, 1976. (a) In any one fiscal year, if only one beneficiary member of a family files a claim (regardless of the number of bene\u00ad ficiary members actually in the family), that beneficiary member is only required to satisfy a fifty ($50) dollar annual fiscal year deductible for outpatient serv\u00ad ices and/or supplies as described in paragraph (f) (2) (i) p i this section. (b) In any one fiscal year, if 2 or more beneficiary members of a family file claims, the total amount of which is less than one hundred ($100) dollars, but none of the beneficiary members submit a claim for over fifty ($50) dollars, no CHAMPUS benefits are payable for otherwise covered outpatient services and/or supplies provided such benefici\u00ad ary members during that particular fiscal year. -(c) For any family, the outpatient de\u00ad ductible amounts will be applied sequen\u00ad tially, as the CHAMPUS claims are sub\u00ad mitted. (d) If the fiscal year outpatient de\u00ad ductible has been met by a beneficiary ($50) or a. family ($100 aggregate) through the submission of a claim(s) to a CHAMPUS Contractor in another geo\u00ad graphic location from the location where a current claim is being submitted, the beneficiary (or sponsor) must obtain a deductible certificate from the CHAMPUS Contractor where the appli\u00ad cable individual and/or family fiscal year deductible was met. Such deductible cer\u00ad tificate must be attached to the current claim being submitted for benefits. Failure to obtain a deductible certificate under such circumstances will result in a second individual and/or family fiscal year deductible being applied. However, this second deductible may be reim\u00ad bursed once appropriate documentation as described in this paragraph (f) (2) (i) (d) of this section is supplied to the CHAMPUS Contractor applying the second deductible. (Refer to paragraph (a) of \u00a7 199.13, \"Claims ents of active duty members of the Uni\u00ad formed Services (or their sponsors) are responsible for the payment of the first twenty-five ($25) dollars of the reason\u00ad able institutional costs incurred with each covered inpatient admission to a hospital or other authorized institutional provider (refer to \u00a7 199.12 \"Authorized Providers\") , or the amount the bene- ficiary/patient (or sponsor) would have been charged had the inpatient care been provided in a Uniformed Service hospital, whichever is greater. Note.\u2014The Secretary of Defense (after consulting with the Secretary of Health, Ed\u00ad ucation and W elfare), prescribes the fair charges for inpatient hospital care provided through Uniformed Services medical facili- 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 18001 ties. This determination is currently made on an annual basis. The following chart gives the applicable amounts for each calendar year since 1966: Calendar year 1966 ---- 1967 ___ 1968 ___ 1969 1970 ___ 1971 ___ 1972 1973 1974 1975 , ___ 1976 1977Charge per day $1.75 1.75 1.75 1.75 1.75 1.75 1.75 1.75 3.50 3 .70 3.90 4.10 (a) Inpatient cost-sharing payable with each separate inpatient admission. A separate cost-sharing amount (as de\u00ad scribed in paragraph (f) (2) of this sec\u00ad tion) is payable for each inpatient ad\u00ad mission to a hospital or other authorized institution regardless of the purpose of the admission (i.e., maternity, surgery, etc.), regardless of the number of times the beneficiary/patient is admitted and regardless of whether* or not the in\u00ad patient admissions are for the same -or re\u00ad lated conditions; except that successive inpatient admissions shall be deemed one inpatient confinement for the purpose of computing the inpatient cost-share pay\u00ad able, provided not more than 60 days have elapsed between the successive ad\u00ad missions. However, notwithstanding this provision, all admissions related to a single maternity episode shall be consid\u00ad ered one confinement, regardless of the number of days between admissions. (Refer to paragraph (b) of this section.) (b) Multiple family inpatient admis\u00ad sions. A separate cost-sharing amount is payable for each inpatient admission re\u00ad gardless of whether or not 2 or more beneficiary members of a family are ad\u00ad mitted at the same time and/or from the same cause (such as an accident). A separate beneficiary inpatient cost-shar\u00ad ing amount must be applied for each separate admission of each beneficiary member of the family. (c) Newborn: Patient in his or her own right. When a newborn infant re\u00ad mains as an inpatient in his or her own right (usually after the mother is dis\u00ad charged), the newborn child becomes the beneficiary/patient and the ex\u00ad tended inpatient stay becomes a separate inpatient admission. In such a situation a new, separate inpatient cost-sharing amount is applied. If a multiple birth is involved (i.e., twins, triplets, etc.), and 2 or more newborn infants become patients in their own right, a separate inpatient cost-sharing amount must be applied to the inpatient stay for each newborn child who has remained as an inpatient in his or her own right. (iii) Outpatient cost-sharing: De\u00ad pendents of active duty members of the Uniformed Services (or their sponsors) are responsible for payment of 20 per\u00ad cent of the CHAMPUS-determined rea\u00ad sonable cost/charge in excess of the an\u00ad nual fiscal year deductible amount (as described in paragraph (f) (2) (1) of this section) for otherwise covered servicesand/or supplies provided on an outpa\u00ad tient basis by viders.\" ) (3) of deceased active duty mem\u00ad bers; and dependents of deceased re\u00ad tirees. CHAMPUS beneficiary liability set forth for retirees, dependents of re\u00ad tirees, dependents of deceased active duty members, and dependents of de\u00ad ceased retirees is as follows: (i) Annual fiscal year deductible for outpatient services and/or supplies. The annual fiscal year deductible for other\u00ad wise covered outpatient services and/or supplies provided retirees, dependents of retirees, dependents of deceased active duty members, and xiependents of de\u00ad ceased retirees is identical to the an\u00ad nual fiscal year outpatient deductible applicable to dependents of active duty members. (Refer to paragraph (f) (2) (i) of this section.) (ii) Inpatient cost-sharing. Retirees, dependents of retirees, dependents of de\u00ad ceased active duty members, and de\u00ad pendents of deceased retirees are re\u00ad sponsible for the payment of 25 percent of the CHAMPUS-determined reasona\u00ad ble costs/charges for otherwise covered services and/or supplies provided on an inpatient basis by an authorized pro\u00ad vider. (iii) Outpatient cost-sharing. Retirees, dependents of retirees, dependents of de\u00ad ceased active duty members, and de\u00ad pendents of deceased retirees are re\u00ad sponsible for payment of 25 percent of the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable costs/charges in excess of the annual fis^- cal year deductible amount (as described in paragraph (f)(2 )(ii) of this section) for otherwise covered services and/or supplies provided on an outpatient basis by authorized providers. (4) Amounts in excess of CHAMPUS- determined reasonable costs/charges. It is the responsibility of the CHAMPUS Contractor to determine Treasonable costs for services and supplies provided by hospitals and other institutions and rea\u00ad sonable charges for services and supplies provided by physicians, other individual professional providers, and other pro\u00ad viders. Such CHAMPUS-determined reasonable costs/charges are made in ac\u00ad cordance with the \"Authorized Pro\u00ad of the CHAMPUS and/or beneficiary cost-sharing amounts, are based on such CHAMPUS-determined reasonable costs/charges. The effect on the beneficiary when the billed cost/ charge is in excess of the CHAMPUS- determined reasonable amount is de\u00ad pendent upon whether or not the appli\u00ad cable claim was submitted on a partici\u00ad pating basis on behalf of the benefici\u00ad ary/ patient or submitted directly by the beneficiary on a non-participating basis. This provision applies to all classes of CHAMPUS beneficiaries. Note.\u2014In any situation where the pro\u00ad vider \"forgives\" or \"waives\" any beneficiary liability, such as amounts applicable to the annual Fiscal Year deductible for outpatientservices and/or supplies, or the inpatient or outpatient cost-sharing as previously set forth in this section, the CHAMPUS-deter\u00ad mined reasonable charge/cost allowance (whether payable to the CHAMPUS benefici\u00ad ary or sponsor, or to a participating pro\u00ad vider) shall be reduced by the same amount. (i) Participating provider. Under CHAMPUS, an authorized provider has the option of participating on a claim- by-claim basis. If a provider elects to participate, the provider signs the ap\u00ad plicable CHAMPUS claim form(s) and submits it to the appropriate CHAMPUS Contractor. (In the case of an institution or medical supplier, the claim must be signed by an individual having such authority.) This signature certifies that the provider has agreed to accept the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable charge/cost as payment in full for the medical services and supplies listed on the specific claim form; and further has agreed to accept the amount paid by CHAMPUS and/or the CHAMPUS pay\u00ad ment combined with the cost-sharing amount paid by (or in behalf of) the beneficiary/patient, as full payment for the covered medical services and/or sup\u00ad plies. Therefore, when costs/charges are submitted on a particiapting basis, the patient is not obligated to pay any amounts disallowed as being in excess of the CHAMPUS-determined reason\u00ad able cost/charge for authorized medical services and/or supplies. (ii) Non-participating providers. Non\u00ad participating providers are those pro\u00ad viders who do not sign the CHAMPUS claim form and thereby do not agree to accept the CHAMPUS-determined rea\u00ad sonable costs/charges as the full charge. For otherwise covered services and sup\u00ad plies provided by such non-participating CHAMPUS providers, payment is made directly to the beneficiary (or sponsor) and the beneficiary is liable under ap\u00ad plicable law for any amounts in excess of the CHAMPUS-determined reason\u00ad able costs/charges. CHAMPUS shall have no responsibility for any amounts in excess of reasonable costs/charges as determined by CHAMPUS. - (g) Exclusions and limitations.

(a) General. The Program for the Handicapped is essentially a program of financial assistance for military person\u00ad nel on active duty whose spouses or chil\u00ad dren may be moderately or severely men\u00ad tally retarded or seriously physically handicapped and in need of specialized institutional care, training, or rehabili\u00ad tation and the required services are not available from public institutions or agencies. The Program for the Handi\u00ad capped was established by Congress to be a source of financial assistance in those instances where an active duty member's handicapped dependents have, by virtue of residency laws, been ex\u00ad cluded from appropriate publicly-oper\u00ad ated programs or institutions for the handicapped. There is, therefore, a re\u00ad quirement that all local resources must be considered and those determined to be adequate, utilized first, before an ap\u00ad plication for coverage under the Pro\u00ad gram for the Handicapped will be acted on by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). There is a further require\u00ad ment that all institutional care other\u00ad wise authorized be provided in not-for- profit CHAMPUS approved institutions. Coverage for any services or supplies un\u00ad der the Program for the Handicapped re\u00ad quires prior approval. i, 1977 18004 RULES AND REGULATIONS (1) Physical or mental examinations. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a des\u00ad ignee) , may request a beneficiary to sub\u00ad mit to one or more appropriate medical (including psychiatric) examinations in order to determine the beneficiary's en\u00ad titlement to benefits for which applica\u00ad tion has been made or for otherwise au\u00ad thorized services and supplies required in the proposed management plan for the handicapped individual. When such an examination has been requested, CHAM PUS will withhold payment of any pend\u00ad ing claim (s) or preauthorization requests for that particular beneficiary. If the beneficiary (or sponsor) does not agree to the requested examination, or unless prevented by a medical reason acceptable to CHAMPUS, the examination is not performed within 90 days of the initial request, all pending claim (s) for services and supplies will be denied. A denial of payments for such services and/or sup\u00ad plies provided prior to, and related to the request for a physical examination, is not subject to reconsideration. The cost of the examination(s) will be at the ex\u00ad pense of CHAMPUS (including any re\u00ad lated beneficiary transportation costs). The examination (s) may be performed by a physician(8) in a Uniformed Serv\u00ad ices medical facility or by an appropriate civilian physician (s ), as determined and selected by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), who is responsible for making such arrangements as are neces\u00ad sary. (2) Right to information. As a condi\u00ad tion precedent to the provision of bene\u00ad fits hereunder, OCHAMPUS and/or CHAMPUS Contractors shall be entitled to receive information from a physician or hospital or oth\u00e9r person, institution, and/or organization (including a local, state or Federal Government agency) providing services or supplies to the ben\u00ad eficiary for which claims or requests for approval for benefits are submitted. Such information and records may re\u00ad late to the attendance, testing, monitor\u00ad ing, or examination or diagnosis of, or treatment rendered, or services and sup\u00ad plies furnished to, a beneficiary and shall be necessary for the accurate and effici\u00ad ent administration of CHAMPUS bene\u00ad fits. in addition, before a determination on a request for preauthorization or claim for benefits, a beneficiary or spon\u00ad sor must provide particular additional information relevant to the requested determination when necessary. The re\u00ad cipient of such information shall in every case hold such records confidential except when: (i) Disclosure of such in\u00ad formation is specifically authorized by the beneficiary; (ii) disclosure is neces\u00ad sary to permit authorized Governmental officials to investigate and prosecute criminal actions; or (iii) disclosure is specifically authorized or required under the terms of the Privacy Act and/or Freedom of Information Act (refer to paragraph (m) \u00a7 199.7, \"General\" ) . For the purposes of of and implementing Act\", respectively, or any provisionof similar purpose of any other medical benefits coverage or entitlement, OCHAMPUS and/or CHAMPUS Con\u00ad tractors may, without consent or notice to any beneficiary (or sponsor), release to any insurance company or other or\u00ad ganization, Government agency, pro\u00ad vider or other entity any information with respect to any beneficiary when such release constitutes a routine use duly published in the Federal Register in accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U-S.C. 552.a.). Before an individual's claim for benefits will be adjudicated, the individual must furnish to CHAM PUS that information which may rea\u00ad sonably be expected to be in his or her possession and which is necessary to make the benefit determination. Failure to provide the requested information may result in denial of the claim. (3) Timely filing of claims. All claims submitted for benefits under this section must be filed with the appropriate CHAMPUS Contractor no later than De\u00ad cember 31 of the calendar year follow\u00ad ing the one in which the covered serv\u00ad ice or supply was provided. Failure to timely file a claim automatically waives all rights to any benefits for otherwise covered services and/or supplies. (Refer to \u00a7 199.12 \"Claims Submission, Review and Payment\".) (4) Eligibility for benefits\u2014 (i) Eligi\u00ad bility criteria. Eligibility criteria for CHAMPUS generally are contained in \u00a7 199.9. However, coverage of the Pro\u00ad gram for the Handicapped includes and is further limited to: (a) The dependents, as defined in \u00a7 199.9, of a member of one of the Uni\u00ad formed Services who is under call or order to active duty that does not spec\u00ad ify a period of 30 days or less who are moderately or severely mentally retarded or who have a serious physical handicap; or (b) The dependents of a deceased active duty service member who died after January 1, 1967, while eligible for receipt of hostile fire pay or from a dis\u00ad ease or injury incurred while eligible for such pay, who are under 21 years of age, and who otherwise meet the criteria of paragraph (a) (4) (i) (a) of \u00a7 199.9, and were receiving benefits under the Pro\u00ad gram for the Handicapped at the time of said member's death. (ii) Sponsor Ceases to be Active Duty Member. When the sponsor ceases to be an active duty member because of death, benefits under the Program for the Handicapped may be continued up through the last day of the calendar month following the month in which the sponsor's death occurred. When the sponsor ceases to be an active duty mem\u00ad ber for any other reason, i.e., retirement, separation or deserter status, benefits trader the Program for the Handicapped cease as of 12:01 a.m. of the following day the status of the sponsor changes. Exception is made only for those spouses and children under 21 years of age of de\u00ad ceased members qualifying for continued benefits under provisions of paragraph (a) (4) (i) (b) of \u00a7 199.9. Any support or aid for the handicapped individual afterCHAMPUS benefits cease are the respon\u00ad sibility of the sponsor (or parent or guardian). (iii) Scope of benefits. Subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this regulation, the Program for the Handicapped provides financial assist\u00ad ance toward the purchase of services and/or supplies necessary for the follow\u00ad ing: (a) - Diagnosis, (b) Inpatient, out\u00ad patient and home treatment, (c) Train\u00ad ing, rehabilitation and special education, (d) Institutional care in private not-for- profit or public and state institutions and facilities, (e) When appropriate, trans\u00ad portation to and from such institutions and facilities. (b) Cost-sharing. The sponsor is re\u00ad quired to pay a portion of the costs for each month in which the dependent re\u00ad ceives benefits under the Program for the Handicapped. The amount the sponsor pays is based upon the pay grade. The amounts required of members in each pay grade are as follows: Member's pay grade: Share amount E -l 4, 0-4 50 0 - 5 ______________ 65 0-6 ______________ 200 0-10 ___________________ 250 Except as specifically set forth in para\u00ad graph (b) (3) of this section, the Govern\u00ad ment's share of the cost of any benefits provided under the Program for the Handicapped cannot exceed $350 per month. Any amount remaining after the Government's maximum share has been reached is again the responsibility of the active duty member. In ascertaining the total charges against which the sponsor's and the Government's shares will be computed, certain considerations are made: (1) Charges/costs must be reasonable. The charges/costs must be reasonable for the services and/or supplies provided. The cost-share computations will be made on the amount determined to be reasonable under the method used in the operation of the Basic Program (Refer to \u00a7 199.12, \"Authorized Providers\" ) and equivalent to a monthly billing unit. (2) CHAMPUS share limit. The CHAMPUS share of the reasonable charges/costs of all benefits: Provided, The handicapped beneficiary in a given month will not exceed three hundred fifty ($350) dollars per month, except when there are two or more handicapped dependents in the same family, as de\u00ad scribed in paragraph (b) (3) of this section. (3) Two or more handicapped depend\u00ad ents. In those instances where an active duty, member has two or more depend\u00ad ents incurring expenses in a given month, the active duty member's monthly obligation will not be greater than he or she would be required to pay FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 197/ * RULES AND REGULATIONS 18005 if he or die had but one such dependent receiving benefits under the Program for the Handicapped. Such active duty member will be charged on the basis of the handicapped dependent incurring the least expense under the Program for the Handicapped in any given month. The active duty member is, however, obli\u00ad gated to pay at least the amount indi\u00ad cated for his or her applicable pay grade shown in paragraph (b> of this section. When the cost for one dependent is less than the amount shown for the appli\u00ad cable pay grade, the active duty member is obligated to pay such additional amount as is required to meet the cost shown for his or her pay grade in para\u00ad graph Cb) of this section toward satis\u00ad fying the bill of the second dependent receiving benefits under the Program for the Handicapped. C 4 ) No prepayment of services. In no case will payment be made in advance for services not yet rendered. (5) Absence from an institution: Cost\u00ad sharing implications. As a general rule, CHAMPUS will not cost-share any costs incurred during a period the handi\u00ad capped dependent is absent from an in\u00ad stitution with the following exceptions: (i) Illness or injury requiring hos\u00ad pitalization. When the handicapped de\u00ad pendent requires hospitalization, bene\u00ad fits under the Program for the Handi\u00ad capped may be continued up to the last day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which the hospital inpatient stay began. (ii) Emergency situations. Benefits under the Program for the Handicapped may be continued in bona fide emergency situations, such as serious illness or death in the immediate family, but in no case longer than 7 days including travel time. (iii) Therapeutic absences. When a handicapped dependent leaves an insti\u00ad tution for a therapeutic absence, bene\u00ad fits under the Program for the Handi\u00ad capped may be continued for a period not to exceed 72 hours, including travel time. (iv) Holiday or school vacation. When a handicapped dependent leaves an in\u00ad stitution for a recognized holiday or school vacation during the school term, benefits under the Program for the Handicapped are limited to not more than 7 days each, including travel time, except that one such absence of up to 1 5 days, including travel time, is author\u00ad ized each year. Payments for holiday and vacation absences are authorized only when all paying patients in the facility are chargeid for the absentee. (v) Recording of absences. An ab\u00ad sences must be noted on the claim form and a detailed statement attached to the claim form explaining the duration and reason for the absence. Failure to do so will result in termination of benefits. (c) Criteria for qualifying for the pro\u00ad gram for the handicapped benefits \u2014 (1) General requirements. To be considered for benefits, the applicant must be medi\u00ad cally determined to be moderately or severely retarded or seriously physically handicapped to the following extent: <i) Duration of handicap. The condi\u00ad tion is expected to result in death; or has asted, or is, with reasonable certainty,expected to last for a minimum of 12 months; and (ii) Extent of handicap. The disability caused by the handicap is of such severity as to preclude the handicapped individ\u00ad ual from engaging in substantially basic productive activities of daily living ex\u00ad pected of unimpaired persons of the same age group. (2) Management plan. The services and supplies provided the individual un\u00ad der the Program for the Handicapped must be appropriate t6 the indrvidual's disability and should, to the maximum extent possible, benefit the individual through the treatment of the disabling condition or by enhancing the individ\u00ad uars ability-to cope with or overcome the disability. The primary goal of the Pro\u00ad gram for the Handicapped is to maximize the potential of the individual to achieve as nearly a normal life style as possible and to maintain the individual in or to return the individual to, the home, pub\u00ad lic school and community environment whenever possible. (3) Purchase limitations. Such serv\u00ad ices and supplies as may be authorized for purchase under the Program for the Handicapped are limited to appropriately functional and utilitarian services and supplies. Utility and economy will be given primary consideration in approval of equipment. - Example. Where basic mobility is required, a manual wheelchair will be authorized un\u00ad less the physical disability is such that only an electric wheelchair is suitable. (4) Application approval. The Direc\u00ad tor, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), is vested with the final approval authority on all applications for coverage under the Program for the Handicapped. This in\u00ad cludes the determination as to the se\u00ad verity of the handicap and the appropri\u00ad ateness of the supplies or services to the handicapping condition for which coverage is requested. The Director, OCHAMPUS Cor a designee), will re\u00ad quest such information as is deemed nec\u00ad essary to. make these determinations be\u00ad fore issuing approvals or denials. Failure to supply such information will be cause for deferral or denial of an application. (i) Deferral of application. In those situations where there has been a de\u00ad ferral of an application for coverage un\u00ad der the Program,for the Handicapped be\u00ad cause of inadequate information, but where the application is subsequently approved, such subsequent approval may be applied retroactively (i.e., for any otherwise covered care provided prior to actual approval) but limited to the pe\u00ad riod from the date the initial pre\u00ad authorization request was received at OCHAMPUS. (ii) Denial of application. In those situations where there has been denial of an application for coverage under the Program for the Handicapped, for any reason, and a subsequent application re\u00ad ceived and approved, the subsequent ap\u00ad plication is considered a new application and benefits may not be extended retro\u00ad actively except as specifically provided for in paragraph (c) (4) (3) of this sec\u00ad tion.(d) Mental retardation \u2014 (1) Define tion. The term \"mental retardation\" re\u00ad fers to subnormal general intellectual functioning and is associated with im\u00ad pairment of either learning and social adjustment or maturation, or both. The diagnostic classification of moderate and severe mental retardation relates to IQ as follows: (i> Moderate. Moderate mental retar\u00ad dation\u2014IQ 36-51. (ii) Severe. Severe mental retarda\u00ad tion\u2014IQ 35 and under. Note.\u2014It is recognized that the intelli\u00ad gence quotient should not be the only cri\u00ad terion used in making a diagnosis of mental retardation or in evaluating its severity. It should serve only to help in making a clin\u00ad ical judgment of the patient's adaptive be\u00ad havioral capacity. This judgment should also be based on an evaluation of the patient's developmental history and present function\u00ad ing, including academic and vocational achievement, motor skills, and social and emotional maturity. (2) Acceptable tests to measure intel\u00ad ligence. The Wechsler Pre-School and Primary Scale of Intelligence, the Wech\u00ad sler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) or Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) are the CHAMPUS instru\u00ad ments of choice to determine IQ; how\u00ad ever, a St^nford-Binet will be accepted. A person who cannot be tested by an age-appropriate instrument listed above can be tested by another test, provided that an acceptable explanation of why one of the listed tests could not be used is furnished to OCHAMPUS, along with a detailed explanation of \"scoring\" the test, for the purpose of statistical com\u00ad parison with one of the above tests. IQ tests must be interpreted by a qualified psychologist certified by the state where the test is administered, or in states where certification is not required, the psychologist must have at least a Mas\u00ad ter's Degree in psychology. In states which certify \"psyebometrists\" to admin\u00ad ister and interpret IQ tests, that cer\u00ad tification will suffice. (e) Serious physical handicap. \u2014 (1) Definition. The term \"serious physical handicap\" means a medical condition of the body, which meets the following criteria: (1) Duration of handicap. The condi\u00ad tion is expected to result in death, or has lasted, or with reasonable certainty is expected to last, for a minimum of 12 months; and (ii) Extent of handicap. The condition is of such severity as to preclude the in\u00ad dividual from engaging in substantially basic productive activities of daily living expected of unimpaired persons of the same age group. For example; (a) Persons alder than high school age must be generally unable to engage in gainful pursuits because of the handicap. (b) Persons of school age, up to and through high school age, must be unable to be provided an education through the public school system because of the handicap. (2) Examples of conditions which may cause serious physical handicaps. Condi\u00ad tions which may result in serious physi- y FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 18006 RULES AND REGULATIONS eal handicaps include, but are not limited to, the following listed categories: (i) Visual impairment: Age seven < 7 > and over. A vision impairment will be considered serious in persons seven (7) years of age and older if: (a) The remaining vision in the better eye after best correction is 20/200 or less; or (b) The contraction of visual fields is to 10 degrees or less from the point of fixation; or (c) So the widest diameter subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees; or id) The visual efficiency of the better eye after best correction is 20 percent or less; or (e) Other conditions impairing visual function such as complete homonymous hemianopsia, or total bilateral ophthal\u00ad moplegia; and (/) Which have reached the point where individual requires assistance to support the essentials of daily living. (ii) Vision Impairment: Under age seven (7).

A hearing impairment will be considered serious in those cases where the hear\u00ad ing impairment (not correctable by a hearing aid) is manifested by: (a) Absence of air and bone conduc\u00ad tion in both ears (auditory perception of not more than one pure tone at high volume will be considered as absence of air and bone conduction); or (b) No more than 40 percent discrimi\u00ad nation for speech (i.e., ability to hear and understand no more than 40 out of 100 words of special test lists of words using a speech audiometer or hearing aid); and (c) Which have reached a point where the individual requires assistance to sup\u00ad port the essentials of daily living. (iv) Deafness: Under age seven (7), A hearing impairment in children under 6 years of age will be considered serious (even if correctable by a hearing aid) in those cases where the hearing im\u00ad pairment is manifested by a 30 decibel or more air conduction hearing loss in at least one ear. (v) Epilepsy: Major. Major motor seizures (grand mal or psychomotor) substantiated by EEG, occurring more frequently than once a month in spite of prescribed treatment. With: (a) Diurnal episodes (loss of con\u00ad sciousness) and or (b) Nocturnal episodes which show re\u00ad siduals interfering with activity during the day; and (c) Which has reached the point where the individual requires assistance to support the essentials of daily living.(vi) Epilepsy: Minor. Minor motor seizures (petit mal or psychomotor) sub\u00ad stantiated by EEG, occurring more fre\u00ad quently than once weekly in spite of prescribed treatment. With: (a) Alternation of awareness or loss of consciousness; and (b) Transient postictal manifesta\u00ad tions of unconventional or antisocial be\u00ad havior; and (c) Which has reached the point where the individual requires assistance to support the essentials of daily living. (vii) Paralysis Agitans (Parkinson's Disease ). With: (a) Tremor, rigidity, and significant impairment of mobility (e.g., festina\u00ad ci\u00f3n) ; and (b) Which has reached the point where the individual requires assistance to support the essentials of daily living. (viii) Cerebral Palsy. With: (a) IQ of 83 or less; or (b) Abnormal behavior patterns, such as destructiveness, or emotional instabil\u00ad ity; or (c) Significant interference in com\u00ad munication due to speech, hearing, or visual defect; or (d) Significant motor deficit in two extremities; and (e) Which has reached a point where the individual requires assistance to sup\u00ad port the essentials of daily living. (ix) Multiple Sclerosis. With: (a) Significant motor deficits in two extremities; and (b) substantiated by appro\u00ad priate cerebellar signs or proprioceptive loss; and (c) Which has reached the point where the individual requires assistance to sup\u00ad port the essentials of daily living. (x) Muscular Dystrophy. With: (a) Significant motor impairment and restricted mobility; and (b) Flexion deformities of both lower extremities; or (c) Significant weakness or paralysis of muscles of the shoulder girdle or of neck, with abduction of both arms at shoulder restricted to less than 90 de\u00ad grees; and (d) Which has reached the point where the individual requires assistance to support the essentials of daily living. (xi) Degenerative neurological dis\u00ad eases. Other degenerative neurological diseases (i.e., Huntington's chorea, Friedreich's ataxia, spinocerebellar de\u00ad generation, etc.) which have reached the point where the individual requires as\u00ad sistance to support the essentials of daily living. (xii) Musculoskeletal system. Serious impairments of the musculoskeletal sys\u00ad tem which have reached the point where the individual requires assistance to sup\u00ad port the essentials of daily living. (xiii) Respiratory system. Serious im\u00ad pairments of the respiratory system which have reached the point where the individual requires assistance to support the essentials of daily living. (xiv) Trauma. Serious impairments resulting from trauma which are at a level that requires assistance to support the essentials of daily living.(xv) Diabetes Mellitus. Severe physi\u00ad cal limitations resulting from diabetes mellitus occurring in children (i.e., under 18 years of age) which have reached the point where the individual requires as\u00ad sistance to support essentials of daily living. (xyi) Multiple conditions. In tome in\u00ad stances, there are two or more condi\u00ad tions involving separate body systems, neither condition in itself seriously handicapping, but which, in combina\u00ad tion, are of such severity as to delimit activities in a seriously handicapping manner and have resulted in the indi- vijdual requiring assistance to support the activities of daily living. Each such multiple condition case will be reviewed on its own merits* (f) Procedures for obtaining benefits. Active duty members seeking benefits under the Program for the Handicapped for a dependent spouse or child must se\u00ad cure authorization from OCHAMPUS for such benefits in advance. Payments will not be made for any services or supplies under the Program for the Handi\u00ad capped received/obtained prior to ap\u00ad proval of the application by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). (1) Completed application. Applica\u00ad tion is made by completing a CHAMPUS Form 190a, \"Request for Health Bene\u00ad fits Under the Program for the Handi\u00ad capped\" (as may be amended), and mail\u00ad ing it to the Director, OCHAMPUS, Denver, Colorado 80420. (2) Additional required information. The applicant will also submit along with the required CHAMPUS Form 190a, the following: (i) Statement of Dependent's Condi\u00ad tion. A medical statement of the de\u00ad pendent's condition, giving a specific diagnosis, using the most current ICDA, history of mental retardation or physical handicap, present condition, prognosis, and a proposed, detailed management plan for the handicapping condition, in\u00ad cluding estimated charges/costs. This statement must be signed by the super\u00ad vising physician. The medical report may be submitted directly by the physician if so desired. (ii) Use of Other Than Public Facili\u00ad ties. Within the United States, if the management plan proposes to use other than public facilities, a statement is re\u00ad quired from a cognizant public official certifying to the fact that public facili\u00ad ties are or are not available or are or are not adequate to meet the needs of the the handicapped individual, and that public funds are or are not made avail\u00ad able for support of the needs of the handicapped individual in alternative facilities deemed adequate. Note.\u2014Inasmuch as there Is great diver\u00ad sity in the types of public programs and institutions offering services to the handi\u00ad capped, it is impossible to list in detail the cognizant public officials in each state, coun\u00ad ty, or local community. As a general rule, the cognizant public official is associated with a public program who has broad knowledge of and authority for providing the services related to the types of handicap, for which CHAMPUS benefits are being requested. For example, in the case of a mentally retarded FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 school-age child who needs to be placed in a sp\u00e8cial class for the educable handi\u00ad capped, the cognizant public official could be the Director of Special Education for the local school district rather than the principal of the nearest school. In some states where sp\u00e8cial educational programs are managed at the state level, the cognizant public of\u00ad ficial may have to be the State Director of Speeial Education. In still other cases where some kind of vocational rehabilitation is re\u00ad quired,, the cognizant public official may be an official in the State Department of Voca\u00ad tional Rehabilitation, while in another state all vocational rehabilitation programs may be controlled by the Department of Human Resources or the Department of Social Serv\u00ad ices. It is the sponsor's responsibility to de\u00ad termine the appropriate cognizant public official. (iii) Information on available pro\u00ad grams. OCHAMPUS will assist a sponsor to obtain information from those agen\u00ad cies that are possible sources of assist\u00ad ance for the specific condition, (iv) Application review procedure. A review of the Program for the Handi\u00ad capped applications will be done by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), who will: (a) Determine if the individual's de\u00ad gree of mental retardation or physical disability (as documented by a physi\u00ad cian) is such as to qualify for benefits ; ibi Evaluate the proposed manage\u00ad ment plan to determine if it is appropri\u00ad ate to the handicapping condition and if the charge/cost is reasonable; or if the services to be provided can be obtained more effectively and economically in an\u00ad other CHAMPUS-approved facility pro\u00ad viding the same services; and (c) Evaluate the cognizant public of\u00ad ficial's statement if the management plan proposes the use of private facilities. (d) If, in the opinion of the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), the state\u00ad ment of the cognizant public official is inadequate or inappropriate, additional information will be required and the sponsor will be required to contact the agency or official determined to be most cognizant of programs for the handicap\u00ad ped in the sponsor's community and ob\u00ad tain a statement as to availability or non\u00ad availability of appropriate public faci\u00ad lities. . ' Note.\u2014Due to both the wide variety of handicapping conditions and the large num\u00ad ber of public institutions and agencies which operate independently of each other, the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), will establish contact with these institutions and agencies and offer information and assistance to CHAMPUS beneficiaries so that they can obtain access to those public programs to which they have a legal entitlement. This will include information on such matters as the interstate Compact, in which many states participate, state laws regarding the right to education, services under the Rehabilita\u00ad tion Act, and similar programs. Approval for Program for the Handicapped benefits will a issued only when it has been determined to the satisfaction of the Director, OCHAM us (or a designee), that the required serv-, \u00ae n\u00b0t available from public sources u ProPosed plan of management will be beneficial to the handicapped person. (v) Application approval: Limitations. The application approval will be specificRULES AND REGULATIONS as to the approved facility, management plan and/or services and supplies being authorized under the Program for the Handicapped as well as the specific period of time for which authorization is being made. The application approval may also list other requirements (such as a speci\u00ad fic r\u00e9\u00e9valuation requirement in 6 months). Note.\u2014The approved application is valid for only 90 days. If admission to the approved facility is not accomplished and/or the management plan is not commenced within 90 days of the date the application is ap\u00ad proved, a new application must be submitted for evaluation. (vi) Periodic review and r\u00e9\u00e9valuation. A periodic review and r\u00e9\u00e9valuation of the status of individuals who have been ap\u00ad proved for coverage under the Program for the Handicapped will be conducted by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a des\u00ad ignee), under the following circum\u00ad stances : 0 (a) At least annually The supervising physician's report, a completed CHAM\u00ad PUS Form 141, \"Diagnostic Evaluation, Program for the Handicapped,\" a new, updated management plan, and a new cognizant public official's statement will be submitted reflecting any changes which may have occurred in the 12 month period. Note.\u2014The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) may require that any specific case be reviewed more often than annually. (b) Change of institution. When a de\u00ad pendent handicapped beneficiary is re\u00ad moved from an institution which was the basis for the issuance of an approval under the Program for the Handicapped, placement in. a new institution requires a new application. (c) Sponsor reassignment. A sponsor who is reassigned to another location within the United States will be required to determine within 60 days from the date of reporting to a new duty assign\u00ad ment, if public facilities appropriate to the needs of the handicapped dependent are available. If they are not, it will be necessary to substantiate this fact with a new cognizant public official's state\u00ad ment. Failure to take such action will result in termination of coverage under the Program for the Handicapped on the 61st day following the date the sponsor reported to the new duty assignment. Note.\u2014If it is determined that public fa\u00ad cilities are available at the new location, the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) may determine that the handicapped beneficiary may continue to receive benefits for inpa\u00ad tient care at the former location under the PFTH until the end of the current school year. (g) Use of public facilities. To qualify for benefits under the Program for the Handicapped,. public facilities and/or state funds must be used to the maximum extent they are available or adequate. (1) Statement of school official or other cognisant public official. For de\u00ad pendents for whom special educational benefits are requested, the sponsor must submit a statement from the superin\u00ad tendent of the local public school district.18007 or designee, to the effect that the public school district is aware in detail or the individual's tested educational handicaps and'that an adequate educational oppor\u00ad tunity is or is not available for the in\u00ad dividual, either in the public schools or thrbugh public resources. A statement must be made by certificate as to whether or not applicable law requires public funds to help defray the cost of private schooling in the event public schooling is not available or adequate; and if the law requires such funding. If there is a wait\u00ad ing list for \"adequate\" public care, the anticipated length of wait must be stated. A new statement from the superintend\u00ad ent of the local public school district, or a designee, will be required at the be\u00ad ginning of each school year, or more fre\u00ad quently, as determined by the Director,, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) . (2) Determination that public facility is adequate. A certified statement by a cognizant public official that a public fa\u00ad cility or service is or is not available and is or is not adequate to meet the needs of the handicapped spouse or child is prima facie evidence of the facts stated. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a de\u00ad signee) , has final authority in determin\u00ad ing whether a facility is available and adequate. CHAMPUS benefits will not be extended in those situations where the beneficiary (or sponsor) elects not to use the public facilities which have been de\u00ad termined to be available and adequate. (3) State contracts with private facili\u00ad ties. As an exception, when a state (but not a county or municipality) govern\u00ad ment contracts for institutional care in private facilities, payment to the state is authorized sinee the care provided in such facilities or homes is considered to be state institutional care. In such case, the following 4 requirements must be met and appropriate documentation sub\u00ad mitted: (i) Determination of State responsi\u00ad bility. A determination must be made by the state that it has a responsibility for providing care for the dependent's hand\u00ad icapping condition. (ii) Determination that Public facility placement cannot be made. The state or other local jurisdiction must determine that the dependent cannot be placed in a public facility and no state funds are available for such care. (iii) State must make placement. The state must make the placement, or deter\u00ad mine that it is responsible for a depend\u00ad ent already placed. (iv) Acceptable billing and financial procedure. The state must be billed for the services provided by the private fa- - cility. The state may not simply act as an \"intermediary\" or a conduit for billing and payment purposes; and CHAMPUS cannot be billed by the state for a greater amount than that billed to other non- CHAMPUS patients in like circum\u00ad stances.: (h) Covered setvices and supplies \u2014 *(1) General. As a general rule, the serv\u00ad ices and supplies covered under the Pro\u00ad gram for the Handicapped are those services and supplies which contribute directly to the habilitation or rehabili- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 18008 tation of the handicapped individual. This may include institutional care when the severity of the disability requires protective custody in an institutional setting. Active medical or surgical treat\u00ad ment of an acute illness may be con\u00ad sidered under the CHAMPUS Basic Program where such treatment is- not included as a part of the management plan or a routine part of the institutional services approved under the Program for the Handicapped. Notwithstanding, all services, supplies, and equipment re\u00ad quired by and directly related to the handicapping condition, including those services and supplies approved under the management plan, shall be consid\u00ad ered for benefits only under the Pro\u00ad gram for the Handicapped, whether or not under other circumstances Basic Benefits could apply. The only exception to this requirement is a serious, acute ex\u00ad acerbation of the handicapping condition requiring an inpatient hospital stay. In such case, Basic Program benefits are ap\u00ad plicable for the required period of hos\u00ad pitalization. Examples, (i) A mentally retarded child in an institution for the retarded becomes ill with appendicitis and is admitted to a general hospital for surgery. The charges related to the inpatient episode in a general hospital for the acute appendicitis are con\u00ad sidered under the Basic Program. (ii) Another individual with a neurological disability, such as Parkinson's disease, is placed, under the Program for the Handi\u00ad capped, in an institution for- individuals similarly afflicted. The institutional charges are all-inclusive and all residents receive routine medications, diet supplements, pe\u00ad riodic medical examinations, etc., and those services and supplies are part of the total management plan. This situation would be cost-shared under the Program for the Handicapped and benefits would not be available under the CHAMPUS Basic Pro\u00ad gram. (ill) In the third situation, an individual, placed in an institution under the Program for the Handicapped because of Huntington's Chorea, experiences an acute episodic period which warrants admission to a hospital for medical treatment of the acute phase and which was not included as a part of the approved management plan. This inpatient hospital care would be considered for bene\u00ad fits under the Basic Program. (2) Extent of covered services and supplies. Subject to such other defini\u00ad tions, conditions, limitations and exclu\u00ad sions enumerated in this and other sec\u00ad tions of this regulation, the following services and supplies (including durable equipment) are covered under the Pro\u00ad gram for the Handicapped (P F T H ): (i) Diagnostic evaluation. Diagnostic evaluation on either an inpatient or out\u00ad patient basis by a physician. This in\u00ad cludes hospitalization or institutionaliza\u00ad tion solely for the purpose of conducting diagnostic studies performed by or under the supervision of a physician if such an inpatient setting is medically necessary to perform the diagnostic evaluation. Diagnostic evaluations do not require prior approval, but are payable only in those cases resulting in approval of the handicapped beneficiary under the PFTH. If the diagnostic evaluation is done on an inpatient basis, any benefitsRULES AND REGULATIONS for the inpatient stay related to such evaluation will not exceed 5 days of an inpatient stay. (ii) Durable equipment. The purchase of durable equipment may be authorized where certified by a physician as neces\u00ad sary in the treatment, habilitation or rehabilitation of a handicapped benefici\u00ad ary. Except under extremely unusual situations (which would require individ\u00ad ual review and consideration), durable equipment required by an institutional\u00ad ized handicapped beneficiary must be provided by the institution as a part of the management plan and included in the monthly institutional charges. * ' () In order to qualify as durable equipment under the PFTH, the item will be evaluated against the following (1) it must be clearly related to and necessary for the habilitation, treat\u00ad ment, or training of beneficiaries with the given handicap. (2) It must improve the function of a malformed body member or retard fur\u00ad ther deterioration of the handicapped beneficiary's physical condition. (3) It cannot be useful to anyone in the absence of a physical or mental dis\u00ad ability. (4) It must be primarily and cus\u00ad tomarily used to serve a medical or habilitative purpose rather than pri\u00ad marily for transportation, comfort or convenience. Note\u2014A wheelchair is not considered transportation in the sense of this paragraph (h) (2) (ii) (a) (4) of this section. It qualifies as durable medical equipment under para\u00ad graph (h) (2) (ii) (a) (2) of this section, be- , cause by providing basic mobility, it retards further deterioration of the patient's physi\u00ad cal condition. Mobility, beyond that basic mobility provided by a wheelchair is con\u00ad sidered to' be primarily transportation. For example, cart-type vehicles, (such as the \"Amigo\" ) do not qualify as durable medical equipment. (5) I t cannot be beyond the minimum level of performance and quality required under the circumstances (i.e., non\u00ad luxury, non-deluxe). However, this sub\u00ad division is not intended to preclude special fitting of equipment to accom\u00ad modate a particular disability (such as fitting a wheelchair for a one-armed in\u00ad dividual) . () It is not available for loan from a local Uniformed Services medical treatment facility. (7) Only one similar item of durable equipment will be purchased during any one period of time; and benefits include repair of durable equipment purchased under the PFTH and its subsequent re\u00ad placement if it is determined that the previous item is no longer usable. (8) There must be written preauthor\u00ad ization by OCHAMPUS prior to the date of purchase of durable equipment. Such authorization is specific as to the item of durable equipment being approved. Fur\u00ad ther such authorization is only valid for 90 days from date issued. If the item of durable' equipment is not purchased within the time limit, a new preauthor\u00ad ization is required. Purchase of durableequipment may not be approved retro\u00ad actively. (9) Benefits may also be extended for the reasonable changes for repair and replacement parts (such as batteries), including adjustment of durable equip\u00ad ment purchased under the Program for the Handicapped. Such repair or part replacement or adjustment does not re\u00ad quire preauthorization unless the charge is $50.00 or more. In the case of an emer\u00ad gency, a charge above that amount may be considered without preauthorization, subject to special review. (b) Cost-sharing of durable equip\u00ad ment purchases. Durable equipment will normally be cost-shared in the month that the purchase is made. However, where the price of durable equipment is high charge/cost item, the sponsor has the option of spreading the purchase price evenly over a consecutive 6 month period, beginning with the month of purchase: Provided, That no payments will be made by CHAMPUS beyond the termination of eligibility as a CHAM\u00ad PUS beneficiary. No other payment op\u00ad tion is available. (iii) Prescription drugs and medicines. Prescription drugs and medicines; and insulin for a known diabetic are covered. Drugs and medicines are limited to those approved for general use by humans (other than testing) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (iv) Outpatient treatment. Such out\u00ad patient treatment as may be appropriate to the treatment and habilitation of the handicapped person related to the hand\u00ad icapping condition is coverable. Such services would include, but not be lim\u00ad ited to, physical therapy, occupational therapy, vocational training, speech therapy, and special educational services. (v) Home treatment. Certain services authorized by this section may be pro\u00ad vided to the handicapped individual in the home if that setting is considered the most reasonable and appropriate. Such services would include, but not be lim\u00ad ited to, physical therapy, occupational therapy, vocational training, speech therapy, and special educational services. (vi) Institutional care (inpatient). In\u00ad stitutional care within the PFTH is pi*i- marily long-term residential (inpatient) care for the handicapped individual to private nonprofit, public, or state insti\u00ad tutions and facilities. Such institutions include, but are not limited to, schools for the deaf and blind and institutions for the physically and/or mentally handicapped persons. (vii) Special optical devices. Certain special optical devices necessary to ame\u00ad liorate the handicapping condition are covered, but are limited to the following: (a) Contact lenses necessary to cor\u00ad rect a visual handicap which qualifies under paragraph (e) (2) (i) of this sec\u00ad tion. (b) Subnormal visual corrective de\u00ad vices such as telescopic and isoiconic lenses. (c) Optical aids such as hand-held optical devices for reading. (viii) Prosthetic devices and ortho\u00ad pedic appliances. Such prosthetic de\u00ad vices and orthopedic appliances as are FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64 \u2014MONDAY, APRIL 4, 19 77 needed to correct or overcome a physical disability are covered. This includes ar\u00ad tificial limbs and orthopedic braces. (i^Professional services. The services of a wide variety of both medical and educational professionals are covered.

Where there is no license requirement, they must be eligible for membership in the state or national association setting the standards for their respective group. (b) Services of teachers of the handi\u00ad capped who meet the standards of the school system in the jurisdiction in which located and who provide special education such as, but not limited to, remedial reading, speech training, or special classes for seriously physically handicapped Or moderately or severely mentally retarded children. (c) Services of vocational instructors who teach physically handicapped or mentally retarded persons a trade or oc\u00ad cupation, e.g., teaching a blind person to be a mechanic or typist. These instruc\u00ad tors must meet the standards in the school system where the training is being conducted. (d) The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), is the final authority as to whether a professional (either as an in\u00ad dividual or as a class) is approved as an authorized professional provider under the PFTH. (x) Related therapy. Therapy, such as family counseling, for parents of a hand\u00ad icapped child, is authorized when need\u00ad ed as an integral part of the treatment for the child, as determined by the Di\u00ad rector, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), and approved as a part of the management plan. (xi) Special tutoring. Tutoring by qualified individuals provided on an out\u00ad patient basis or in the patient's home to individuals who are either physically handicapped or moderately or severely mentally retarded is an authorized bene\u00ad fit. Tutors tnust meet qualifications out\u00ad lined in paragraph (h) (2) (i) (a), (b), and (c) of this section. Private tutoring to supplement a public education or spe\u00ad cial education enhancement programs, or training program for a child tempo\u00ad rarily disabled due to acute illness or in\u00ad jury, is not covered under'the Program for the Handicapped. (xii) Surgery and medical care. When necessary to treat or correct a handicap\u00ad ping condition, as defined in this \u00a7 199.11 by the terms \"mental retardation\" (moderate or severe) or \"serious physi\u00ad cal handicap,\" surgery and medical care may be authorized on either an inpa\u00ad tient or outpatient basis. Where appro-RULES AND REGULATIONS priate and approved as a part of the management plan, this may include au\u00ad thorized adjunctive dental care. (xiii) Training and special education. (a) Education or training needed to al\u00ad leviate, overcome or adjust to a serious physical handicap or moderate or severe mental retardation is an authorized benefit provided it is included as a part of the approved management plan. This includes, but is not limited to, remedial reading, speech training, use of artificial aids, and education provided physically handicapped and mentally retarded per\u00ad sons on either an inpatient or* outpatient basis. (b) Training and special education also includes special vocational training or education wherein a physically handi\u00ad capped or mentally retarded person is taught a trade or occupation to aid in overcoming or adjusting to his condition (e.g., teaching a blind person to be a mechanic or typist), but in no event beyond high school level. (xiv) Transportation, (a) Transpor\u00ad tation is authorized for medically eligible handicapped dependents by Govern\u00ad ment, commercial, public or private means to and from approved facilities in which the dependent is to deceive or has received institutional care for which benefits have been approved under the Program for the Handicapped. Transpor\u00ad tation must be necessary and justified by the attending physician. (b) Transportation benefits may be re\u00ad quested in conjunction with an applica\u00ad tion for other benefits under the Pro\u00ad gram for the Handicapped, or a request for approval of transportation benefits may be submitted separately. (c) If other than local public trans\u00ad portation or transportation by privately- owned vehicles is to be used, a request for approval must be supported with evi\u00ad dence that a less expensive means of transportation is not available, or that the means to be used is medically neces\u00ad sary.

(e) When distant transportation is medically necessary, Government trans\u00ad portation will be used in every instance, when available. Under very unusual cir\u00ad cumstances, if determined to be medi\u00ad cally necessary and also certified by the attending physician, transportation for a medical attendant may be approved. (xv) Transportation restrictions, (a) Transportation benefits are subject to the $350 per month limitation on Gov\u00ad ernment cost under the Program for the Handicapped and must be applied during the month the transportation actually occurs. The cost may not be prorated over a period of months. Any transportation cost shall be added to any other cost of care under the Program for the Handi\u00ad capped for that month. (b) Reimbursement for travel costs will be made on the basis of actual trans\u00ad portation costs when transportation is18009 by privately-owned vehicle or the ticket costs in the case of other kinds of travel, plus other reasonable transportation costs, such as airport limousine, in con\u00ad nection with medically necessary air travel. Receipted bills must be obtained for any transportation costs not covered by a ticket. The cost of meals, motels, tips, etc., that may be related to trans\u00ad portation is not an authorized benefit.

(e) Carpooling will be required when\u00ad ever possbile when two or more handi\u00ad capped dependents are seeking reim\u00ad bursement of travel costs by private ve\u00ad hicle to and from the same location. Only the owner/operator of the vehicle used in the carpool may be reimbursed. Reimbursement is limited to actual transportation costs or $0,155 per mile, whichever is lower. (i) Utilization review/quality assur\u00ad ance. It is the intent of this Regulation that before any benefits may be extended, any services and supplies furnished by any provider shall be subject to utiliza\u00ad tion review and quality assurance stand\u00ad ards, norms and criteria issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). (j) General limitations. All services and treatment received under the Pro\u00ad gram for the Handicapped must be in connection with the handicapping con\u00ad dition. Medical or surgical services re\u00ad quired, but not in connection with the handicapping condition, can be consid\u00ad ered for benefits under the Basic Pro\u00ad gram. In such a situation the active duty service member is responsible for cost\u00ad sharing under both programs. The fol\u00ad lowing services are not covered under the Program for the Handicapped: (1) Academic education. Specialized academic education for those with edu\u00ad cational or learning disabilities normally provided in a public school system or institution of higher learning are not covered benefits under the Program for the Handicapped. These learning dis\u00ad abilities include dyslexia, perceptual handicaps, hyperkinetic behavior syn\u00ad drome, neurological dysfunction, reading disability and minimal brain dysfunction. (This does not exclude learning disabili\u00ad ties which are derived from or related to moderate or severe mental retardation or a serious physical handicap.) (2) Alternations. Alternations to living spaces and permanent fixtures attached thereto even when necessary to accom\u00ad modate installation of covered durable equipment or to facilitate ingress or egress, not authorized for payment under the Program for the Handicapped.

FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 18010 RUiES AND REGULATIONS (4) Dental care. Dental care, except for adjunctial dental care required in the treatment of a handicapping condition, is not authorized. Orthodontic treatment is not authorized under any circum\u00ad stance. (5) Non-approved drugs and medica\u00ad tions. Drugs and medications not ap\u00ad proved for general use by humans by the TJ.S. Food and Drug Administration, whether or not legally, available outside the United States. However, if a drug or medicine is listed in the \"U.S. Phar\u00ad macopeia, and/or \"National Formulary\" and requires a prescription, it is not ex\u00ad cluded by this provision even if it is under investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration' as to its effectiveness. Note: In areas outside the United States standards similar to those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is the CHAMPUS objective. (6) Outside the United States. Facili\u00ad ties outside the United States are not eligible as an approved facility under the PFTH regardless of whether other\u00ad wise qualified. In addition, any excur\u00ad sions outside the United States are not eligible for benefits even though part of a program offered by an approved facil\u00ad ity in the United States. (k) Authority to determine eligibility under program for the handicapped. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) is authorized to review a Basic Program case and make a determination that the particular beneficiary meets the defini\u00ad tions of a moderately or severely retarded and/or seriously physically handicapped dependent as set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, whether or not an application for benefits under the PFTH has been submitted by the spon\u00ad sor. In such event, the Director, OCHAM PUS (or designee) will notify the spon\u00ad sor that benefits for services and/or sup\u00ad plies related to the handicapping condi\u00ad tion (s) are no longer available under the CHAMPUS Basic Program (except under those circumstances as may otherwise be specifically set forth in this section); and further, that the Basic Program case will be transferred to the Program for the Handicapped as of the first day of the second month following the date of such notice. (l) Implementing instructions. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) shall issue a CHAMPUS Operating Man\u00ad ual and such other instructions, proce\u00ad dures, guidelines, standards and/or cri\u00ad teria as may-be necessary to implement the intent of this section, \"Program for the Handicapped.\" \u00a7 199.12 Authorized providers. (a) General. This paragraph sets forth general policies and procedures that are the basis for the CHAMPUS cost-sharing of medical services and sup\u00ad plies provided by institutions, individ\u00ad uals, or other types of providers. (1) Listing of provider does not guar\u00ad antee payment of benefits. The fact that a type of provider is listed in this section is not to be construed to mean that CHAMPUS will automatically pay a claim for services or supplies provided by sucha provider. CHAMPUS Contractors must also determine if Hie patient is an eligi\u00ad ble beneficiary and whether the services or supplies billed are authorized and medically necessary, regardless of the standing of the provider to the provi\u00ad sions of this section. (2) Outside the United States or Emergency Situations within the United States. Outside the United States, or within the United States and Puerto Rico in emergency situations, the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), may after review of the facts provide payment to or on behalf of a beneficiary who re\u00ad ceives otherwise covered services and/or supplies from a provider of service that does not meet the standards described in this regulation. Note: Only the Secretary of Defense, or Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (or their designees) may authorize (in emer\u00ad gency situations) payment to civilian facil\u00ad ities in the United States and Puerto Rico which are not in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (3) Conflict of interest. Federal law (5 U.S.C. 5536) prohibits medical per\u00ad sonnel who are active duty members or civilian employees of the Government from receiving additional Government compensation above their normal pay and allowances for medical care rendered. This prohibition applies to CHAMPUS benefits whether the claim for reimburse\u00ad ment is filed by the individual who pro\u00ad vided the care, the facility in which the care was rendered, or by the sponsor and/or beneficiary. CHAMPUS payments will also be disallowed to Special Treat\u00ad ment Facilities, Residential Treatment Centers, or other institutional providers that are found to employ (moonlighting) any member or employee of the Uni\u00ad formed Services, either uniformed or civilian, who, through an official Federal position, has the opportunity to exert directly or indirectly, any influence on the referral of CHAMPUS beneficiaries to that institution. This prohibition is intended to preclude possible conflicts of interest. All such instances coming to the attention of the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), will be referred to the applicable Uniformed Service for investi\u00ad gation and appropriate action. However, any situations in which it appears that CHAMPUS beneficiaries/patients are be\u00ad ing channeled to selected individual pro\u00ad fessional providers in the civilian sector when other similar participating provid\u00ad ers are available, will be investigated by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a des\u00ad ignee) . If any conflicts or improprieties are found to exist, such cases will also be referred to the appropriate Uniformed Service for appropriate action. A report of the results of the findings and action taken shall be made to the Director, OCHAMPUS (with a copy to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense) by the Uniformed Service having juris\u00ad diction, within 90 days of receiving the referral. Note: Physicians of the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) may be assigned to remote areas where there is a shortage of medical providers. Although these physicianswould be prohibited from accepting CHAM PUS payments, the private organizations to which they may be assigned would remain eligible for payment in certain cases, as de\u00ad termined by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). (4) Fraudulent practices or proce\u00ad dures. \u2014 (i) Provider exclusion CHAM\u00ad PUS determination. The Director, OCH AMPUS (or a designee) shall deny pay\u00ad ments to any provider (or to a benefi\u00ad ciary for the services rendered by that provider) that has been found knowingly submitting or making any false, ficti\u00ad tious, or fraudulent statement or claim against the Program or assisting any beneficiary in making similar false, fic\u00ad titious or fraudulent statements or claims. Payment will also be denied for claims resulting from care rendered by a provider subsequent to notice by OCHAMPUS of that provider's disqualifi\u00ad cation from particpation in CHAMPUS. False, fictitious and fraudulent claims include those claims in which the amount has been adjusted to an artificial level (i.e., higher than the usual charge to other patients) to permit the provider to waive the deductible and/or cost-share amounts owed by the beneficiary (or sponsor) but still compensating the pro\u00ad vider, without a significant reduction in the full amount normally received for such care. In such cases the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), should also provide notice to the beneficiary popula\u00ad tion in the locality of the provider for whom payments are being denied, by means of notification to Uniformed Serv\u00ad ices' facilities and offices. (ii) Provider exclusion HEW determi\u00ad nation. Any provider that has been deter\u00ad mined by the Secretary of the Depart\u00ad ment of Health, Education, and Welfare to have furnished supplies or services which were substantially in excess of the needs of individuals, or to be harmful to individuals, or to be of a grossly inferior quality; and the Secretary has on the basis of such a determination terminated the agreement of that provider for pur\u00ad poses of reimbursement under Titles XVH I and X IX of the Social Security Act, will also be denied CHAMPUS re\u00ad imbursements (or to a beneficiary for services rendered by that provider). (iii) For-Profit Institutions Excluded Under Program for the Handicapped. Public law precludes payment of benefits under the Program for the Handicapped for otherwise covered services and sup\u00ad plies provided by a for-profit institution. (Refer to \u00a7 (5) Utilization review/quality assur\u00ad ance. It is the intent of this Regulation that before any benefits may be extended, any services and supplies furnished by any provider shall be subjected to utiliza\u00ad tion review and quality assurance stand\u00ad ards, norms and criteria issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). (Refer Review Payment,\" respec\u00ad tively.) FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 (6) Physician required. Except as may otherwise be specifically provided in this and other sections of this regulation, hi order to be considered for benefits, medi\u00ad cal services and/or supplies received from any provider (other than a doctor pf medicine or doctor of osteopathy) must be at the direction of, prescribed by and/ or ordered by, a physician. (7) Participating provider. Under CHAMPUS, an authorized provider has the option of participating on a claim- by-claim basis. If a provider elects to participate, the provider signs the appli\u00ad cable CHAMPUS claim form(s) and sub\u00ad mits it to the appropriate CHAMPUS Contractor on behalf of the beneficiary/ patient. (In the case of an institution or medical supplier, the claim must be signed by an individual having such au\u00ad thority.) This signature certifies that the provider has agreed to accept the CHAM- PUS-determined reasonable charge/cost as payment in full for the medical serv\u00ad ices and supplies listed on the specific claim form; and further has agreed to accept the amount paid by CHAMPUS and/or the CHAMPUS payment com\u00ad bined with the cost-sharing amount paid by (or in behalf of) the beneficiary /pa\u00ad tient, as full payment for the covered medical services and/or supplies. (b) Institutional providers \u2014 (1) Gen\u00ad eral. Institutional providers are those providers who bill for services in the name of an organizational entity (e.g., hospital, skilled nursing facility, etc.) rather than in the name of individual. The term \"institutional provider\" does not include professional corporations or associations qualifying as a domestic cor\u00ad poration under \u00a7 301.7701-5 of the Fed\u00ad eral Income Tax Regulation nor does it include other corporations that provide principally professional services. Insti\u00ad tutional providers may provide medical services and supplies on either an inpa\u00ad tient or outpatient basis. (1) Preauthorization. Except for ad\u00ad missions to those institutions which qualify as hospitals, infirmaries or Chris\u00ad tian Science sanitoriums, for purposes of Basic Program benefits, in order for benefits to be extended for inpatient services and supplies, written preau\u00ad thorization is required in accordance with the CHAMPUS Operating Manual and such other instructions, procedures and guidelines issued or caUsed to be issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). (Refer to \u00a7\u00a7199.10 and for the Handicapped,\" respec\u00ad tively.) (ii) Billing practices. Institutional billings must be fully itemized and suf\u00ad ficiently descriptive to the satisfaction of CHAMPUS. In the case of continuous care, claims should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS Contractor, at least every 30 days (i.e., monthly), by either the beneficiary (or sponsor) or directly by the institution, on behalf of the beneficiary/patient. (2) Nondiscrimination policy. Except as provided below, payment cannot be made for inpatient or outpatient care Provided and billed by an. institutionalRULES AND REGULATIONS provider found by the Federal Govern\u00ad ment to practice discrimination in the admission of patients to its services on the basis of race, color or national origin. Further, reimbursement cannot be made to a beneficiary who pays for care pro\u00ad vided by such a facility and submits a claim for reimbursement. In the follow\u00ad ing circumstances, the Secretary of De\u00ad fense (or a designee) may authorize pay\u00ad ment for care obtained in an ineligible facility: (i) Emergency care. Emergency inpa\u00ad tient or outpatient care. (ii) Care rendered prior to finding of a violation. Care initiated prior to a find\u00ad ing of violation and which continues after such violation when it is deter\u00ad mined that a change in the treatment facility would be detrimental to the health of the patient and the attending physician so certifies. (iii) Other facility not available. Care provided in an ineligible facility because of the absence pf an eligible facility within a reasonable distance. (3) Procedures for qualifying as a CHAMPUS-approved institutional pro\u00ad vider. General and special hospitals otherwise meeting the qualifications out\u00ad lined in paragraph (b) (4) ( i), (ii), and (iii) of this section are not required to formally request CHAMPUS approval. (i) JCAH accreditation status. Each CliAMPUS Contractor will keep in\u00ad formed as to the current JCAH accredi\u00ad tation status of all hospitals in its area; and the hospitals' status under Medicare with regard to compliance with Title VT of the Civil Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 2000d(l)). All other authorized institu\u00ad tional providers providing services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries must be specif\u00ad ically approved as a source of care by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a desig\u00ad nee) . (ii) Required to comply with criteria. Facilities seeking CHAMPUS approval will be expected to comply with appro\u00ad priate criteria set forth in subparts of this Section. They also are required to complete and submit CHAMPUS Form 200 (\"Required Information, Facility Determination Instructions\" ) and pro\u00ad vide such additional information as may be requested by OCHAMPUS. An on-site evaluation, either scheduled or non- scheduled, may be conducted at the dis\u00ad cretion of the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). The final determination re\u00ad garding approval, reapproval, or dis\u00ad approval of a facility will be provided in writing to the facility and the appro\u00ad priate CHAMPUS Contractor. (iii) Surveying of facilities. The sur\u00ad veying of newly established institutional providers and the periodic resurveying of all authorized institutional providers is a continuing process conducted by OCHAMPUS. (iv) Institution hot in Compliance with CHAMPUS Standards. If a deter\u00ad mination is made that an institution is not in compliance with one or more of the standards applicable to its specific category of institution, OCHAMPUS shall take immediate steps to bring18011 about compliance or terminate its ap\u00ad proval as an authorized institution. (a) Minor violations. An institution determined to be in minor violation of one or more of the standards shall be advised by certified mail as to the nature of the discrepancy (ies) and will be given a grace period of not less than 30 days to effect appropriate corrections. i l ) During i such grace period, CHAMPUS will not cost-share on any beneficiary/patients admitted during the grace period. (2) Any beneficiaries already in the institution (or their sponsors) shall be notified in writing of the minor viola\u00ad tions and the grace period granted to the institution to correct them. (3) If the institution notifies OCHAMPUS (in writing) before the end of the grace period that corrective ac\u00ad tion has been taken, those beneficiaries in the institution (or their sponsors) will be notified and benefits continued (assuming the case is otherwise cov\u00ad ered) . Also, for any beneficiary admitted during th\u00e8 grace period, benefits may begin to be extended (if the case is other\u00ad wise covered) as of 12:01 a.m. on the day notice of correction is received by OCHAMPUS. (4) If the institution has not notified OCHAMPUS (in writing) before the end of the grace period that corrective ac\u00ad tion has been completed, the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a may termi\u00ad nate CHAMPUS approval as an au\u00ad thorized institution. (b) Major violations. A determiiiation. that an institution is in major violation of standards significantly detrimental to life, safety and health, or substantially in violation of approved treatment pro\u00ad grams, will result in immediate termina\u00ad tion as an authorized institution. The institution shall be notified of the termi\u00ad nation, by telegram or .certified mail, such notice to include the nature of the violations. (c) Notice to beneficiary/patients (or sponsor) upon termination of approval as an authorized institutional provider. Whenever approval as an authorized in\u00ad stitutional provider is terminated any beneficiary/patient in the institution (or the sponsor) shall be notified by certified mail of such action at the same time the institution is notified. Notice to the bene\u00ad ficiary (or sponsor) shall also include the nature of the non-compliance violations which resulted in the termination. CHAMPUS benefits may be continued for those cases already approved for bene\u00ad fits for an interim period of up to the last day of the month following the month in which approval of the institu\u00ad tion was terminated. (d) Reinstatement as an authorized institutional provider. Any institution that has its approval as an authorized institutional provider terminated be\u00ad cause of non-compliance with CHAM\u00ad PUS standards and/or approved treat\u00ad ment programs may reapply to the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) for approval. However, reapproval can\u00ad not be granted until an on-site facility review is conducted. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 18012 (4) Categories of institutional pro\u00ad viders. The following categories of In\u00ad stitutional providers may be reimbursed by CHAMPUS for services provided CHAMPUS beneficiaries subject to any and all definitions, conditions, limita\u00ad tions and/or exclusions specified of enu\u00ad merated in this regulation. (1) Hospitals, acute care: General and special. The term \"hospital\" means an institution which: (a) Is primarily engaged in providing to inpatients, by or under the supervision of physicians, diagnostic services and therapeutic services for the medical or surgical diagnosis and treatment of ill\u00ad ness or injury (including maternity), and (b) Maintains clinical records on all inpatients (and outpatients if the facility operates an inpatient department or emergency room). (c) Has bylaws in effect with respect to its operations and medical staff. (d) Has a requirement that every patient be under the care of a physician. (e) Provides 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered professional nurse on duty at all times. (/) Has in effect a hospital utilization review plan that is operational and func\u00ad tioning. (g) In the case of an institution in a state in which state or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hos\u00ad pitals, the hospital: U ) Is licensed pursuant to such law, or (2) Is approved by the agency of such state or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the standards established for such licensing. (h) Has in effect an operating plan and budget. (i) Is accredited by the Joint Commis\u00ad sion on Accreditation of Hospitals and/or meets such other requirements as the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare or the Secretary of Defense finds necessary in the Interest of the health and safety of individuals who are ad\u00ad mitted to and furnished services in the Institution. (ii) Hospitals, psychiatric. A psychiat\u00ad ric hospital is an institution which is primarily engaged in providing psychiat\u00ad ric services for the diagnosis and treat\u00ad ment of mental illness. (a) There are two major categories of psychiatric hospitals: (1) The private psychiatric hospital category includes both proprietary and the not-for-profit nongovernmental in\u00ad stitutions. (2) The second category are those psy\u00ad chiatric hospitals controlled, financed and operated by departments and agen\u00ad cies of either the Federal, state or local government and are always operated on a not-for-profit basis. (b) In order for the services of a pri\u00ad vate psychiatric hospital to be covered, the hospital must comply with the pro\u00ad visions outlined in paragraph (b) (4) of this section, except that paragraph (b) (4) (i) (i) does not apply. In the case of private psychiatric hospitals, all must beRULES AND REGULATIONS accredited by the JCAH in order for their services to be cost-shared under CHAM- PUS. (c) Factors to be considered in deter\u00ad mining whether CHAMPUS will cost- share care provided in a psychiatric hos\u00ad pital include, but are not limited to, the following considerations: (1) Is the prognosis of the patient such that care provided will lead to res\u00ad olution or remission of the mental ill\u00ad ness to the degree that the patient is of no danger to others, can perform routine daily activities, and can be rea\u00ad sonably expected to function outside the inpatient setting. (2) Can the services being provided be more economically provided in an\u00ad other facility or on an outpatient basis. (3) Are the charges reasonable. (d) Is the care primarily custodial and/or domiciliary in nature. (Custodial or domiciliary care of the permanently mentally ill or retarded is not a coverable benefit under the CHAMPUS Basic Pro\u00ad gram.) (iii) Hospitals, long-term: Tubercu\u00ad losis, chronic care, rehabilitation, etc. To be considered a long-term hospital, institutions for individuals with tubercu\u00ad losis or chronic diseases, etc.,' must be an institution (or distinct part of an in\u00ad stitution) primarily engaged in provid\u00ad ing, by and/or under the supervision of a physician, appropriate medical or sur\u00ad gical services for the diagnosis and ac\u00ad tive treatment of the illness or condition i \u00bb which the institution specializes. (a) In order for the services of long\u00ad term hospitals to be covered, the hospi\u00ad tal must comply with the provisions out\u00ad lined in paragraph (b) (4) (i) of this sec\u00ad tion. In addition, in order for services provided by such hospitals to be cover- able by CHAMPUS, they must be pri\u00ad marily for the treatment of the present\u00ad ing illness. (b) Custodial and/or domiciliary care is not coverable under CHAMPUS, even if rendered in an otherwise authorized long-term hospital. (c) The controlling factor in deter\u00ad mining whether a beneficiary's stay in a long-term hospital is coverable by CHAMPUS is the level of professional care and supervision, and skilled nurs\u00ad ing care that the beneficiary/patient re\u00ad quires, in addition to the diagnosis, type of condition, or degree of functional lim\u00ad itations. The type and level of medical services required and/or rendered is con\u00ad trolling for purposes of extending CHAMPUS benefits; not the type of pro\u00ad vider or condition of the beneficiary/ patient. (iv) Skilled nursing facility. A skilled nursing facility is an institution (or a distinct part of an institution) which is primarily engaged in providing to in\u00ad patients, medically necessary skilled nursing care, which is other than a nurs\u00ad ing home or intermediate care facility, and which: (a) Has policies which are developed with the advice of (and with provisions for review of such policies on a periodic basis by) a group of professional person\u00ad nel, including one or more physiciansand one or more registered professional muses, to govern the skilled nursing care and related medical services it provides. (b) Has a physician, a registered nurse, or a medical staff responsible for the execution of such policies. (c) Has a requirement that the medi\u00ad cal care of each patient must be under the supervision of a physician, and pro\u00ad vides for having a physician available to furnish necessary medical care in case of an emergency. (d) Maintains clinical records on all patients. (e) Provides 24-hour skilled nursing service which is sufficient to meet nurs\u00ad ing needs in accordance with the policies developed as provided in paragraph (b) (4) (d) (a) of this section and has at least one registered professional nurse em\u00ad ployed full time. (/) Provides appropriate methods and procedures for the dispensing and ad\u00ad ministering of drugs and biologicals. (g) Has in effect a utilization review plan that is operational and functioning. (h) In the case of an institution in a state in which state or applicable local law provides for the licensing of this type facility, the institution: (1) Is licensed pursuant to such law, or (2) Is approved by the agency of such state or locality responsible for licensing such institutions, as meeting the stand\u00ad ards established for such licensing. (i) Has in effect an operating plan and budget. (?) Meets such provisions of the most current edition of the Life Safety Code of the National Fire Protection Associa\u00ad tion as are applicable to nursing facili\u00ad ties; except that if the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare has waived, for such periods as deemed ap\u00ad propriate, specific provisions of such code which, if rigidly applied, would re\u00ad sult in unreasonable hardship upon a nursing facility. (v) Residential Treatment Centers for Emotionally Disturbed Children (RTC's ). Residential Treatment Centers are in\u00ad stitutions (or distinct units of an institu\u00ad tion) existing specifically for round-the- clock, long-term psychiatric treatment of emotionally disturbed children who have sufficient intellectual potential for re\u00ad sponding to active psychiatric treatment, for whom outpatient treatment is not ap\u00ad propriate, and for whom inpatient treat\u00ad ment is determined to be the treatment of choice. RTC's do not provide domiciliary and/or custodial care, but rather, must be able to provide a total therapeutically planned group living and learning situa\u00ad tion within which individual psycho\u00ad therapeutic approaches are integrated. To be approved by CHAMPUS, private RTC's must: (a) Be accredited by the Joint Com\u00ad mission on Accreditation of Hospitals under the Commission Standards for Psychiatric Facilities Serving Children and Adolescents, and (b) Have entered into a Participation Agreement with OCHAMPUS which re\u00ad quires that the RTC will comply with the CHAMPUS Standards for Psychiat- FEOERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 18013 rie Residential Treatment Centers Serv- ing Children and Adolescents. (The cur\u00ad rent CHAMPUS Standards for Resi\u00ad dential Treatment Centers are provided as Appendix A to this regulation.) (vi) Christian Science Sanitoriums. The services obtained in Christian Science Sanitoriums are by public law covered by CHAMPUS as inpatient care. To qualify for coverage, the sanitorium must be either operated by, or be listed and certified by the First Church of Christ, Scientist. Christian Science San\u00ad itaria are covered without following caveat: Inasmuch as Christian Science treat\u00ad ment is not medical treatment and the language of the Defense Appropriations Act of 1976 (Sections 751(f)) and 1977 (Section 743(f)) limit CHAMPUS cov\u00ad erage to those services and supplies which are \"medically or psychologically neces\u00ad sary to diagnose and treat a mental or physical illness, injury, or bodily mal\u00ad function as diagnosed by a physician, dentist or a clinical psychologist,\" the services of Christian Science Sanitoriums may not be paid by CHAMPUS during FY 1976 and FY 1977. Coverage in the following fiscal years will be dependent upon the language of the Appropriations Act covering that year's appropriation. (vii) Infirmaries. Infirmaries are fa\u00ad cilities operated by student health de\u00ad partments of colleges and-universities to provide inpatient and/or outpatient care to enrolled students. Charges for care provided by such facilities will not be cost-shared by CHAMPUS if the student would not be charged in the absence of CHAMPUS or if the student is covered by a mandatory student health insurance plan, enrollment in which is required as a part of the student's registration in the school and the charges by the college or university include a premium for the student health , insurance coverage. CHAMPUS will cost-share only if en\u00ad rollment in the student health program and/or health insurance plan is volun\u00ad in may also qualify under this provision, sub\u00ad ject to review and approval by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). (viii) Other Specialized Treatment Facilities (STF's ). (a) Care provided by certain specialized treatment facilities (on either inpatient or outpatient basis), other than those listed above, may be cost-shared by CHAMPUS under speci\u00ad fied circumstances. (/) The course of treatment is pre\u00ad scribed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy. (2) The patient is under the supervi\u00ad sion of a physician during the entire course of the inpatient admission or the outpatient treatment. (3) The type and level of care and services rendered by the institution are otherwise authorized by this Regulation. (4) The facility meets all licensing and/or other certification requirements which are extant in the jurisdiction in which the facility is geographically located.(5) Is other than a nursing home, in\u00ad termediate care facility, home for the aged, halfway house, or other institution of similar purpose. (6) Is accredited by the Joint Com\u00ad mission on Accreditation or other CHAMPUS-approved accreditation orga\u00ad nization, if an appropriate accreditation program for the given type of facility is available. As future accreditation pro\u00ad grams are developed to cover emerging specialized treatment programs, such ac\u00ad creditation will be a prerequisite to cov\u00ad erage by CHAMPUS for services pro\u00ad vided by such facilities. (b) In order to assure that CHAMPUS beneficiaries are provided quality care at a reasonable cost when treated by a specialized treatment facility, the Direc\u00ad tor, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), will retain the right to: (1) Require prior approval of all ad\u00ad missions to specialized inpatient treat\u00ad ment facilities. (2) Set appropriate standards for spe\u00ad cialized treatment facilities in addition to or in the absence of JCAH accredi\u00ad tation. (3) Monitor facility operations and treatment programs on a continuing basis and conduct on-site inspections on a scheduled and unscheduled basis. (4) Negotiate agreements of partici\u00ad pation. (5) Terminate approval of a case when it is ascertained that a departure from the facts upon which the admission was originally based has occurred. (6) Declare a specialized treatment facility not eligible for CHAMPUS pay\u00ad ment if that facility has been found to have engaged in fraudulent or deceptive practices. (c) In general, the following disclaim\u00ad ers apply to treatment by specialized treatment facilities: (.1) Just because one period or episode of treatment by a facility has been cov\u00ad ered by CHAMPUS shall not be con\u00ad strued to mean that subsequent episodes of care by the same or similar facility will be automatically covered. (2) The fact that one case has been authorized for treatment by a specific facility or similar type of facility shall not be construed to mean that similar cases or subsequent periods of treatment will be automatically extended CHAM\u00ad PUS benefits. Note.\u2014 Other specialized treatment facili\u00ad ties (STF's) also include those facilities which seek approval to provide care author\u00ad ized under the program for the handicapped. (Refer to \u00a7 199.11 \"Program for the Handi\u00ad capped.\" ) (c) Individual professional providers of care. \u2014 (1) General. Individual profes\u00ad sional providers of care are those provid\u00ad ers who bill for their services on a fee- for-service basis and are not employed or contracted with by an institutional provider. This category also includes those individuals who have formed pro\u00ad fessional corporations or associations qualifying as a domestic corporation un\u00ad der \u00a7 301.7701-5 of the Federal Income Tax Regulations. Such individual profes\u00ad sional providers must be licensed-by thelocal licensing agency for the jurisdic\u00ad tion in which the care is provided; or in the absence of licensure be certified by or be eligible for membership in the appropriate national or professional as\u00ad sociation which sets standards for the profession of which the provider is a member.

Further, such service must be within the scope of the license (or other legal authoriza\u00ad tion) . (ii) Monitoring required. The Direc\u00ad tor, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), is re\u00ad sponsible for developing appropriate monitoring programs and issuing guide-N lines, criteria and/or norms necessary to insure that Program expenditures are limited to necessary medical supplies and services at the most reasonable cost to the Government and beneficiary. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), will also take such steps as necessary to deter overutilization of services. (iii) Christian Science. Christian Sci\u00ad ence Practitioners and Christian Science Nurses are recognized by public law to provide services under CHAMPUS. Inas\u00ad much as they provide services of an ex\u00ad tra-medical nature, the general criteria outlined above do not apply to Christian Science Services. (Refer to paragraph (c) (3) (iv) (b) of this section regarding services of Christian Science Practition\u00ad ers and Nurses.) (2) Interns and residents, interns and residents may not be paid directly by CHAMPUS for services rendered to a beneficiary when their services are pro\u00ad vided as part of their employment (either salaried or contractual) by a hospital or other institutional provider.

In order to bill as such, in\u00ad dividuals must be listed or be eligible for listing in the Christian Science Journal at the time the service is provided. These services are covered with the following caveat: Inasmuch as the Christian Science method of. healing is not medical treatment the language of the Defense Appropriations Acts of 1976 (Section 751(f)) and 1977 (Section 743 (f)) limited CHAMPUS coverage to those services and supplies which are \"medically or psychologically necessary to diagnose and treat a mental or physical illness, injury, or bodily malfunction as diagnosed by a physi\u00ad cian, dentist or a clinical psychologist,\" Christian Science practitioners and nurses cannot be paid by CHAMPUS during PY 1976 or PY 1977.

The CHAMFUS-determined reasonable cost for reimbursement of a hospital or skilled nursing facility shall be determined on the basis of one of the following methodologies, i.e., whichever is in effect at a sp^ci^c hospital or skilled nursing facility at the time covered serv\u00ad ices and/or supplies are provided to a CHAMPUS beneficiary/patient: (i> Billed charges/set rates. The rea\u00ad sonable costs for authorized care shall not exceed the lower of: (a) The actual charge for such service made to the gen\u00ad eral public; or (b) The allowed charge applicable to the policy holders and/or subscribers of the CHAMPUS Contractor for com\u00ad parable services under comparable cir\u00ad cumstances, where extended to CHAM\u00ad PUS beneficiaries by consent or agree\u00ad ment; or (c) The allowed charge applicable to the citizens of the community or state as established by local or state regulatory authority excluding Title X IX of the So\u00ad cial Security Act or other welfare pro\u00ad gram, where extended to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by consent or agreement. (ii) Cost-related reimbursement. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), shall, subject to the approval of the ASD (H A), establish a cost reimburse-1 ment method similar to that utilized for reimbursement of institutional providers under Title X V in of the Social Security Act (generally known as the RCCAC method). (iii) Prospective reimbursement. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), shall, subject to the approval of the ASD(HA), develop an alternative reim\u00ad bursement method utilizing a prospective payment concept. (2) Reimbursement for other than hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a desig\u00ad nee) , shall establish such other methods of determining reasonable cost/charge reimbursement for those institutions, other than hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, as may be required. (3) Reimbursement of individual pro\u00ad fessional providers (including dans) and other providers. The C H A M P U S-determined reasonable charge for reimbursement of an individ\u00ad ual professional provider (including a physician) or other provider shall be one, of the following methodologies, i\u00ae> FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 18015 whichever is in effect in the specific geographic location at the time covered services and/or supplies are provided to a CHAMPUS beneficiary /patient. Such methodology in effect at the time cov\u00ad ered services or supplies are provided shall be known as the \"CHAMPUS Ap\u00ad plicable Schedule.\" (i) Reasonable charge method. The reasonable charge method utilized shall be the Medicare system which is the preferred and primary method for reim\u00ad bursement of physicians, other individ\u00ad ual professional providers, and other providers. The reasonable charge for au\u00ad thorized medical care shall not exceed the lowest of: (a) The billed charge for such services; (b) The charge generally made by the physician or other source under similar circumstance, furnishing such service; (c) The prevailing charge level that, on the basis of statistical data and methodology acceptable to the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), does not exceed the 75th percentile of the cus\u00ad tomary charges made for similar serv\u00ad ices in the same locality during the last preceding calendar year elapsing prior to July 1 of the year in which the claim is received by the CHAMPUS Contrac\u00ad tor; or (d) The charge applicable to the policy holders and subscribers of the CHAMPUS Contractor for comparable services under comparable circum\u00ad stances. Note: However, arbitrary reduction in charges applicable to policy holders and/or subscribers of the CHAMPUS Contractor, in\u00ad cluding the CHAMPUS Contractor's failure to update allowed charges in its private business because of inadequate insurance reserves or other reasons, shaU not be ap\u00ad plicable in determining reasonable charges under this program unless the providers by law or contract agree to accept such re\u00ad ductions as full payment for services provided. (e) A charge that exceeds either the customary charge, prevailing charge, or both, can be determined to be reasonable only where unusual circumstances or medical complications are documented that require additional time, effort, skill, or expense supporting the additional charge, and only if the additional charge made is a customary practice of the medical community within the locality where the medical care was rendered. A reasonable charge may not exceed the billed charge under any circumstances. . (/ > The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), may establish a variation of the above Medicare methodology system for the determination of reasonable charges in a specific geographic area (for authorized medical care) that is designed to achieve the same or similar results in average charge allowances as by the methodology described above; but only under circumstances where an adequate information base to permit utilizing the above methodology is not available. (ii) Alternative Method. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), may, sub- i * vv the approval of the ASD (H A), establish an alternative method of reim-bursement designed to produce reason\u00ad able control over health care costs and to assure a high level of acceptance of the CHAMPUS-determined charge by the physicians or other individual sources of care furnishing such services and sup\u00ad plies. Alternative methodology may be established for any clearly defined geographic area by direct negotiation with the providers, or by such other means as may be established by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), which will produce by agreement or effect average charge allowances not greater than those charged to the general public on July 1, 1976 with an additional allow\u00ad ance representing the demonstrated in\u00ad crease in the cost of doing business for subsequent 12 month periods coincident with the implementation or agreement date for use of the alternative method. (4) Outside the United States. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), shall determine the appropriate reim\u00ad bursement method (s) to be used in the extension of CHAMPUS benefits for otherwise covered medical services and/ or supplies provided by hospitals or other institutional provider, physicians or other individual professional provider or other providers, outside the United States. (f) Implementing Instructions. The Director,. OCHAMPUS (or a designee), shall issue a CHAMPUS Operating Manual and such other instructions, procedures, guidelines, etc. as may be necessary to implement the intent of this section. \u00a7 199.13 Claims submission, review and payment. (a) General. The Director, OCHAM PUS (or a designee), is responsible for assuring that benefits under the CHAMPUS Program are paid only to the extent described in this Regulation. Before benefits can be paid, an appropri\u00ad ate claim must be submitted which pro\u00ad vides sufficient information as to bene\u00ad ficiary identification, the medical services and supplies provided, and double cover\u00ad age information, in order to permit proper, accurate and timely adjudication of the claim by the CHAMPUS Con\u00ad tractor and/or OCHAMPUS. Subject to such definitions, conditions, limitations, exclusions and requirements as may be set forth in this Regulation, the follow\u00ad ing are the CHAMPUS claim filing re\u00ad quirements: (1) CHAMPUS Identification Card Required. A patient is responsible for presenting his or her applicable CHAM PUS Identification Card (i.e., Uniformed Services Identification Card) to the au\u00ad thorized provider of care, which identi\u00ad fies the patient as an eligible CHAMPUS beneficiary. (Refer to \u00a7199.9, \"Eligibil\u00ad ity.\" ) (2) Claim required. No benefit may be extended under the CHAMPUS Basic Program or Program for the Handicap\u00ad ped without the submission of a properly and completely executed appropriate claim form. (3) Responsibility for perfecting claim. It is the responsibility of the CHAMPUS beneficiary (or sponsor) and/or the au\u00ad thorized provider acting on behalf of theCHAMPUS beneficiary/patient to per\u00ad fect a , CHAMPUS Contractor. Neither.a CHAMPUS Contractor nor OCHAMPUS is authorized to prepare a claim on be\u00ad half of a CHAMPUS beneficiary. (4) Obtaining Appropriate Claim Form. The CHAMPUS Program provides specific CHAMPUS forms appropriate for making a claim for benefits for var\u00ad ious types of medical services and sup\u00ad plies (i.e., hospital, physician, prescrip\u00ad tion drugs, etc.). Claim forms may be obtained from the appropriate CHAM PUS Contractor in the state of residence, from the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), or rfom CHAMPUS Advisors located at all Uniformed Services medi\u00ad cal facilities. ! (5) Prepayment not required. A CHAMPUS beneficiary (or sponsor) is not required to pay for the medical serv\u00ad ices or supplies before submitting a claim for benefits. (6) Deductible Certificate. If the fis\u00ad cal year outpatient deductible has been met by a beneficiary ($50) or a family ($100 aggregate) through the submission of a claim (s) to a CHAMPUS Con\u00ad tractor in another geographic location from the location where a current claim is being submitted, the beneficiary (or sponsor) must obtain a deductible certif\u00ad icate from the CHAMPUS Contractor where the applicable individual and/or family fiscal year deductible was met. Such deductible certificate must be at\u00ad tached to the current claim being sub\u00ad mitted for benefits. Failure to obtain a deductible certificate under such cir\u00ad cumstances will result in a second in\u00ad dividual -and/or family fiscal year de\u00ad ductible being applied. However, this second deductible may be reimbursed once appropriate documentation, as described in this paragraph (a) (6) of this section, is supplied to the CHAMPUS Contractor applying the second deduct\u00ad ible. (Refer to paragraph of \u00a7 199.10 Benefits.\" ) (7) Nonavailability Statements (DD Form 1251). In some geographic location and/or under certain special circum\u00ad stances it is necessary for a CHAMPUS beneficiary to determine whether the re\u00ad quired medical care can be provided through a Uniformed Service facility. In such instances if the required medical care cannot be provided by the Uni\u00ad formed Services facility, a Nonavailabil\u00ad ity Statement (DD Form 1251) will be issued. Where required (except for emer\u00ad gencies) , this Nonavailability State\u00ad ment must be issued before medical care is obtained from civilian sources. Fail\u00ad ure to secure such a statement will waive the beneficiary's rights to benefits under CHAMPUS, subject to appeal to the ap\u00ad propriate hospital commander (or higher medical authority). (i) Rules Applicable to Issuance of Nonavailability Statement (DD Form 1251). The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is responsible for pro\u00ad mulgating rules and regulations for the issuance of Nonavailability Statements.

Notwithstanding the claims filing dead\u00ad line described in paragraph (d) of this section, in order to minimize any poten\u00ad tial adverse impact on a CHAMPUS ben\u00ad eficiary (or sponsor) which could result from a retroactive denial, the following additional claims filing procedures are recommended or required: (1) Continuing Care. In any situation where medical services and supplies are being rendered on a continuing basis, an appropriate claim (s) should be submitted every 30 days (i.e., monthly), whether submitted directly by the beneficiary (or sponsor) or by the provider on behalf of the beneficiary/patient. Such claims may be submitted more frequently if the bene\u00ad ficiary or provider so elects. The Direc\u00ad tor, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), may also require more frequent claims sub\u00ad mission based on dollars. Examples of FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 18018 care which may be rendered on a con\u00ad tinuing basis are outpatient physical therapy, private duty (special) nursing, or inpatient stays.

All outpatient psy\u00ad chotherapy services are automatically reviewed and evaluated for benefit pur\u00ad poses at the initial 8-session (visit) in\u00ad terval, and at the 24-session (visit) in\u00ad terval. More frequent review and e v a l\u00ad uation may be required if indicated by the case. Any outpatient psychotherapy extending (and approved for benefits) for up to 6(1 sessions must be referred to peer review to determine whether any additional benefits may be provided. This requirement applies whether the services are rendered by a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a psychiatric nurse, clinical social worker or a marriage and family counselor. (3) Claims Involving the Services of Marriage and Family Counselors. Sec\u00ad tion 743 (a) of Pub. L. 94-419, the Appro\u00ad priations Act for the Department of De\u00ad fense for Fiscal Year ending September 30, 1977, requires that marriage and family counselors make a written report to the referring physician concerning the CHAMPUS beneficiary's progress. Therefore, each claim for reimbursement for services of marriage and family counselors must include a certification to the effect that a written communica\u00ad tion has been made or will be made to the referring physician at the end of treat\u00ad ment, or more frequently, as required by the referring physician. (f) Preauthorization. Where specif\u00ad ically required in other sections of this regulation, preauthorization requires the following: (1) Preauthorization Must be^ Ap\u00ad proved Before Benefits Can be Extended. In those situations requiring preau\u00ad thorization, such request must be sub\u00ad mitted and approved before benefits may be extended. If the beneficiary (or spon\u00ad sor) elects to proceed to obtain the med\u00ad ical services and/or supplies prior to receiving written approval from CHAMPUS, and the request is subse\u00ad quently approved, except as otherwise specifically stated, benefits are limited to that period beginning with the date the preauthorization request was received. If the preauthorization request is denied or not submitted as required under this regulation, no benefits are payable for medical services and/or supplies ob\u00ad tained under such circumstances, whether or not otherwise covered. (i) Specifically Preauthorized Serv\u00ad ices. An approved request specifies the exact services or supplies for which pre\u00ad authorization is being given. In a pre\u00ad authorization situation, benefits cannot be extended for services or supplies pro\u00ad vided beyond the specific authorization. (ii) Time Limit on Preauthorization. Preauthorizations are valid for specific periods of time, usually 90 days from date of issuance. If the authorized serv- FEDEFA-RULES AND REGULATIONS ices or supplies are not obtained within the specified time limit, benefits cannot be extended. (2) Treatment Plan: Management Plan. Each preauthorization request must be accompanied by a proposed medical treatment plan (for inpatient stays under the Basic Program) or man\u00ad agement plan (for services under the Program for the Handicapped) which shall generally include a diagnosis, a de\u00ad tailed summary of complete history and physical, a detailed statement of the problem, the proposed type and extent of treatment/therapy, the proposed treat\u00ad ment modality (including anticipated length of time the proposed modality will be required), any available test re\u00ad sults, consultant's reports and the prog\u00ad nosis.

When\u00ad ever a claim is submitted for benefits un\u00ad der the CHAMPUS Program involving preauthorized services and supplies, the date of the approved preauthorization must be indicated on the claim form and a copy of the written preauthorization must be attached to the appropriate CHAMPUS claim. (g) Claims Review. It is the responsi\u00ad bility of the CHAMPUS Contractor (and/or O CHAMP US, including OCHAMPUSEUR) to review each CHAMPUS claim submitted for benefit consideration to assure compliance with all applicable definitions, conditions, limitations and/or exclusions specified or enumerated in this regulation. It is also required that before any CHAMPUS benefits may be extended, claims for medical services and supplies will be sub\u00ad ject to utilization review and quality as\u00ad surance standards, norms and criteria issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). (h) Benefit Payments. CHAMPUS benefit payments are made either di\u00ad rectly to the beneficiary (or sponsor) or to the provider, depending on the man\u00ad ner in which the CHAMPUS claim is sub\u00ad mitted. (1) Benefit Payments Made to Bene\u00ad ficiary (or Sponsor ). In those instances where the CHAMPUS beneficiary (or sponsor) signs and submits a specific claim form directly to the appropriate CHAMPUS Contractor and/or OCHAM\u00ad PUS (including OCHAMPUSEUR), and any CHAMPUS benefit payments due as a result of that specific claim submis\u00ad sion will be made in the name of, and mailed to, the beneficiary (or sponsor). In such circumstances the beneficiary (or REGISTER, V O L 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRILsponsor) is responsible to the provider for any amounts billed. (2) Benefit Payment Made to Partic\u00ad ipating Provider. In those instances where the authorized provider elects to participate by signing a CHAMPUS claim form and submitting a specific claim on behalf of the beneficiary/pa- tient to the appropriate CHAMPUS Con\u00ad tractor, any CHAMPUS benefit payments due as a result of that claim submission will be made in the name of and mailed to the participating provider. In this sit\u00ad uation, by signing the claim form, the authorized provider agrees to abide by the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable charge/cost (whether or not lower than the amount billed). Therefore, the bene\u00ad ficiary (or sponsor) is responsible only for any required deductible amount and any cost-sharing portion of the CHAM PUS-determined reasonable charge/cost as may be required under the terms and conditions set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 199.10 and 199.11, \"Basic CHAMPUS Explanation of Bene\u00ad fits (CEOB).

(4) Benefit Under $1.00. If the CHAM PUS benefit is determined to be under $ 1.00, payment is waived. (1) Fraud. \u2014 (1) Federal Law. Federal laws (18 U.S.C. 287 and 1001) provide for criminal penalties for knowingly submit\u00ad ting or making any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or claim in any matter within the jurisdiction of any de\u00ad partment or agency of the United States. Examples of fraud include situations in which ineligible persons knowingly use an unauthorized identification card in filing a claim; or where providers submit claims for treatment, supplies or equip\u00ad ment not rendered to, or used for, CHAMPUS beneficiaries; or where a par\u00ad ticipating provider bills the beneficiary for amounts over the CHAMPUS-deter\u00ad mined reasonable charge/cost. (2) Suspected Fraud. Any person, in\u00ad cluding CHAMPUS Contractors, who be- 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 18019 comes aware of a suspected fraud must report the circumstances in writing, to\u00ad gether with copies of any available doc\u00ad uments pertaining thereto, to the Direc\u00ad tor, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), who will initiate an appropriate official inves\u00ad tigation of the case. > - (j) Erroneous Payments and Recoup\u00ad ment\u2014 (1) Types of Erroneous Pay\u00ad ments. Erroneous payments are expendi\u00ad tures of Government funds which are not authorized by law or regulation. Exam\u00ad ples include mathematical errors, pay\u00ad ment for care provided an ineligible per\u00ad son, payment for care which is not an authorized benefit, payment for duplicate claims, inaccurate application of the de\u00ad ductible or co-payment, payment for services not medieally necessary, false claims, etc. (2) Federal Claims Collection Act of 1 9 6 6 . Under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (31 U.S.C. 951-953), each agency of the Federal Government (pur\u00ad suant to regulations jointly promulgated by the Attorney General and the Comp\u00ad troller General of the U.S.) must attempt collection of claims of the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment for money arising out of the activities of the agency. (3) Recoupment Procedures \u2014 (i) CHAMPUS Contractors. When an er\u00ad roneous payment is discovered, CHAM PUS Contractors will take action to ef\u00ad fect recoupment. Such action will be in accordance with the provisions of its CHAMPUS Contract and may include re\u00ad quests for refund or an offset against any other CHAMPUS payment becoming due to the debtor; and in appropriate cases, referral to the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), for review and consideration for submission to the Department of Jus\u00ad tice. Request to a beneficiary (or spon\u00ad sor) or provider for refund or notice of intent to offset shall be made in writing. (ii) Uniformed Services.

The format and content o.f such report(s) shall be as determined neces\u00ad sary for Program integrity purposes by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). (4) Claims denials: clarification or change. In those instances where claim review results in the denial of benefits previously provided but now denied due to a clarification or interpretation of the public law or this regulation; or due to a change in this regulation, no recoup- went action need be taken to recover lunds expended prior to the date of such aetermination. (Refer to paragraph (n) of \u00a7 199.7, \"General.\") (5) Good faith payment. It is the re\u00ad sponsibility of the Uniformed Services to ^ovide eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries ith accurate and appropriate means ofidentification. When sources of civilian medical care exercise reasonable care ' and precaution in identifying persons claiming to be eligible CHAMPUS bene- ficiaries^ and furnish otherwise covered services'and supplies to such persons in good faith, CHAMPUS benefits may be paid subject to prior apifroval by the Di\u00ad rector, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), not\u00ad withstanding the fact that the person receiving the services and supplies is sub\u00ad sequently determined ineligible for bene\u00ad fits. When good .faith payments are made by CHAMPUS as the result of (i) the issuance of erroneous identification cards, or (ii) the failure to retrieve iden\u00ad tification cards in a timely manner from those persons no longer eligible, for CHAMPUS benefits, or (iii) failure to retrieve outdated identification cards and issue new cards when a person's status changes (such as a change from active duty dependent to dependent of a retiree), it is the responsibility of the Uniformed Service to refund such amounts to CHAMPUS. Good faith pay\u00ad ments will not be authorized for services and supplies provided by a civilian source of medical care as the result of its own careless identification procedures. Note.\u2014When It is subsequently deter\u00ad mined that a person was not a CHAMPUS beneficiary, the CHAMPUS Contractor ahd/ or the civilian source of medical care are expected to make all reasonable efforts to obtain payment or recoup the amount of the good faith payment from the person who erroneously claimed to be a CHAMPUS beneficiary. Where appropriate, legal action will be instituted. (k) General assignment of benefits not recognized. CHAMPUS does not recognize any general assignment of CHAMPUS benefits to another person. All CHAMPUS benefits are payable as described in this and other sections of this regulation. \u00a7 199.14 Double coverage. (a) Introduction. Since enactment of the 1966 Amendment to the law that eventually became known as CHAMPUS, double coverage has proliferated. Title 10, United States Code is specific that generally where double coverage exists, CHAMPUS benefits for other than de\u00ad pendents of active duty members shall be \"last pay.\" However, application of double coverage rules for dependents of active duty members is left to be estab\u00ad lished under the broad discretionary authority granted the Secretary of Defense. In recognition that extensive double coverage exists, the following rules and procedures are promulgated to administer the CHAMPUS Program in line with general policies extant in the health and medical insurance industry. The Department of Defense cannot permit payment of CHAMPUS benefits in a manner that would result in the un\u00ad just enrichment of CHAMPUS benefici\u00ad aries (or sponsors) or providers, or which would result in payment of claims for services and/or Supplies for which there is no longer any liability in whole or in part. Neither can other medical benefit plans or programs be permitted to passto CHAMPUS a financial burden that should by law or contract be shared or borne by the other medical benefits plan or program. CHAMPUS is committed to the careful-use* of its funds in order that maximum benefits may be extended to the greatest number of beneficiaries possible within the resources provided by the Congress. The following double coverage provisions are designed to prevent duplicate payment of benefits, in keeping with these stated principles: (b) Definitions. \u2014 (1) Coordination of benefits. \"Coordination of Benefits\" means the coordination, on a primary/ secondary payor basis, of the payment of CHAMPUS benefits with the payments of benefits made by the double coverage plan, to the end that there is no duplica\u00ad tion of benefits paid between the double coverage plan and CHAMPUS. (2) Double coverage. \"Double Cover\u00ad age\" means a situation in which a CHAMPUS beneficiary also has entitle\u00ad ment to insurance, medical service, health and medical plan, or other'gov\u00ad ernment program through employment, law, membership in an organization or as a student (including entitlement by reason of being retired from an organi\u00ad zation or group), which in whole or in part duplicates CHAMPUS benefits, but not including entitlement to receive care from the Uniformed Services medi\u00ad cal care system. (3) Double coverage plan. \"Double Coverage Plan\" means the specific organization, insurance policy, govern\u00ad ment program, etc., under which a CHAMPUS beneficiary has entitlement to medical benefits which in whole or in part, duplicate CHAMPUS benefits. For the purposes of CHAMPUS, the follow\u00ad ing are not included within the definition of \"Double Coverage Plan\" : (i) Medicaid; or (ii) Privately purchased, non-group coverage; (iii) Coverage specifically designed to supplement CHAMPUS benefits (i.e., covering the deductible and cost-sharing amount not paid by CHAMPUS); or (iv) Entitlement to receive care from Uniformed Services medical care facil\u00ad ities. (4) Initial Payment. \"Initial Pay\u00ad ment\" means the extension of benefits prior to determination of primary/sec\u00ad ondary payor status. (5) Last Pay. \"Last Pay\" means a double coverage situation where the tests set forth in paragraph (b) (8) of this section do not apply and the specified medical benefits plan (either CHAMPUS or the double coverage) is always the secondary payor. (6) Medicaid. \"Medicaid\" meansthose medical benefits authorized under Title X IX of the Social Security Act, as- amended, provided to welfare recipients and the medically indigent through pro\u00ad grams administered by the various states. (7) Medicare. \"Medicare\" means those medical benefits authorized under Title X V III of the Social Security Act, as amended, provided to persons 65 years of age or older, certain disabled persons, or persons with chronic renal disease, FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 18020 through a national program adminis\u00ad tered by the Social Security Administra\u00ad tion, Bureau of Health Insurance. (8) Primary Payor. \"Primary Payor\" means the plan or program whose medi\u00ad cal benefits are first payable in a double coverage situation, by virtue of the cir\u00ad cumstances of the beneficiary's entitle\u00ad ment under either CHAMPUS or the double coverage plan first satisfying one of the three following tests. (Such tests are applied in the order set forth. If both medical benefit plans or programs, in\u00ad cluding CHAMPUS, meet the first two tests, the third test is applied.) (i) Test One. The beneficiary's entitle\u00ad ment to the medical benefits plan or program, including CHAMPUS, is based upon the fact he or she is an employee, retired person, member of an organiza\u00ad tion or student; or (ii) Test Two. The beneficiary's en\u00ad titlement to the medical benefit plan or program, including CHAMPUS, is based upon the fact he or she is a child of a male employee, male retired person, male member of an organization or a male student; or (iii) Test Three. The medical*benefits plan or program, including CHAMPUS, under which the beneficiary has been continuously entitled to benefits for the longest period of time (i.e., earliest effec\u00ad tive date of coverage). (9) Privately Purchased Plan. \"Pri\u00ad vately Purchased Plan\" means a private\u00ad ly purchased, non-group medical benefits coverage which the CHAMPUS benefi\u00ad ciary (or sponsor) purchases, provide such entitlement to purchase does not result because of law, employment, membership in an organization or stu\u00ad dent status. (10) Secondary Payor. \"Secondary Payor\" means the medical benefit cover\u00ad age determined not to be the primary payor (i.e., have first pay obligation) by virtue of applying the tests set forth in paragraph (b) (8) of this section. (11) Veterans Benefits. \"Veterans Ben\u00ad efits\" means those medical benefits au\u00ad thorized' under Chapter 17, Title 38, United States Code, available to veterans of the military services with service- connected illnesses or injuries, through programs administered by the Veterans Administration. (12) Workmen's Compensation Bene\u00ad fits. \"Workmen's Compensation Benefit\" means medical benefits available under any workmen's compensation law (in\u00ad cluding the Federal Employees Compen\u00ad sation Act), occupational disease law, employers liability law, or any other legislation of similar purpose, or under the maritime doctrine of maintenance, wages and cure. (c) Dependents of Active Duty Mem\u00ad bers. Coordination of benefits on CHAMPUS claims submitted for other\u00ad wise covered services and/or supplies provided to dependents of active duty members, and which involve double cov\u00ad erage, shall be as follows; (1) Initial Payment. CHAMPUS bene\u00ad fits will be extended on an initial pay\u00ad ment basis, regardless of whether or not it is known that double coverage en\u00ad titlement exists.RULES AND REGULATIONS (1) After the Fact Determination. After the fact of payment of the CHAMPUS benefit, the CHAMPUS Contractor or OCHAMPUS (including OCHAMPUS EUR) will determine the primary/ secondary payor. (ii) Application of Primary Payor/' Secondary Payor Rules. If CHAMPUS, after the initial payment, is determined to be the secondary payor, appropriate reimbursement will be obtained from the double coverage plan determined to be the primary payor. (iii) Exception to Initial Payment Rule for Dependents of Active Duty Members. When it is known by the CHAMPUS Con\u00ad tractor or OCHAMPUS (including OCHAMPUSEUR) prior to adjudication and payment of a CHAMPUS claim that double coverage exists, the CHAMPUS is the secondary payor \"and that a bene\u00ad fit payment has already been made by the primary payor\", the requirement to pay CHAMPUS benefits on an initial pay\u00ad ment basis is waived and any applicable CHAMPUS benefits will be extended on a secondary payor basis. The initial pay\u00ad ment requirement is also waived when tlie double coverage plan is Medicare (refer to paragraph (c) (2) of this sec\u00ad tion.) (2) Title X V III of the Social Security Act, as Amended: Medicare. When ah active duty dependent is also eligible for Medicare benefits (either under Part A, \"Hospital Insurance,\" or Part B, \"Sup\u00ad plementary Medical Insurance\") Medi\u00ad care is always the primary payor and CHAMPUS is always the secondary payor. (i) Medicare Lifetime Reserve. Before CHAMPUS benefits may be extended, the Medicare \"lifetime reserve\" benefit must be used. (ii) Initial Payment-Waived. When Medicare is the double coverage plan, the requirement for initial payment of CHAMPUS benefits described in para\u00ad graph (c)(1 ) (iii) of this section is waived. (d) Retirees; Dependents of Retirees; and Dependents of Deceased Active Duty Members or Retirees. Chapter 55 of Title 10, United States Code, is clear that the CHAMPUS Program is designed as an interim, secondary coverage for re\u00ad tirees, dependents of retirees and de\u00ad pendents of deceased active duty mem\u00ad bers or retirees. Therefore,- CHAMPUS claims submitted for otherwise covered services and/or supplies provided these beneficiary classes, and which involve double coverage, shall be adjudicated as follows: (1) CHAMPUS Always \"Last Pay\". In any double coverage situations, CHAM PUS benefits shall be \"last pay.\" (2) Exclusionary Clause: October 1, 1966 Rule. Generally if a double cover\u00ad age plan has an exclusionary clause which precludes payment of benefits as \"primary payor\" ii the insured is covered . under a Federal health and medical benefits program, it is not recognized by CHAMPUS (refer to, paragraph (h )(2) of this section). However, if the double coverage plan had an exclusionary clause that was in effect prior to October 1 ,1966, CHAMPUS becomes primary pay\u00ad or: Provided, The following requirements are met: (i) Continuously in Effect. The specific double coverage plan containing such ex\u00ad clusionary clause has been continuously in effect since October 1, 1966, or prior, and (ii) Other than FEHBP Plan. The dou\u00ad ble coverage plan is other than one of tiie plans authorized under the Fed\u00ad eral Employees Health Benefits Law (FEHBP) Chapter 89, Title 5, United States Code, as administered by the United States Civil Service Commission. (3) Title X V III of ttle Social Security Act, as Amended: Medicare. (i) Eligible for Part A., \"Hospital In\u00ad surance.\" A retiree, dependent of a re\u00ad tiree and a dependent of a deceased ac\u00ad tive duty member or retiree loses his or her eligibility for CHAMPUS if, upon reaching 65 years of age, or because of disability or chronic renal disease, he or she becomes entitled to Hospital Insur\u00ad ance Benefits (Part A) of Medicare. (Re\u00ad fer to \u00a7 199.9, \"Eligibility.\" ) (a) Under the circumstances described in paragraph (d )(3 )(i) of this section, CHAMPUS eligibility ceases, even though the person lives outside the United States where Medicare benefits are not avail\u00ad able. (b) If upon reaching age 65, a CHAM PUS beneficiary is not entitled to \"Hos\u00ad pital Insurance Benefits\" (Part A) of Medicare, eligibility for CHAMPUS bene\u00ad fits continues. In such event the CHAM PUS beneficiary must file a Social Secu\u00ad rity Administration \"Notice of Disallow\u00ad ance\" (certifying to the fact that he or she does not have ehtitlement to Part A of Medicare) with the- Uniformed Service responsible for the issuance of his or her ID card. A new ID card will then be issued showing continued CHAMPUS eligibility past age 65. (ii) 1972 Amendments to the Social Security Act: Other Part A Eligibility. Certain persons over 65 years of age, who were not previously entitled to Medi\u00ad care Part A, \"Hospital Insurance Bene\u00ad fits,\" became eligible to enroll in Part A after June 30, 1973, under the premi- um-HI provision of the 1972 Amend\u00ad ments to the Social Security Act. Entitle\u00ad ment to Medicare Part A benefits secured under these circumstances does not re\u00ad sult in loss of CHAMPUS eligibility. However, in every such instance of double coverage with Medicare Part A, Medicare is the primary payor and CHAMPUS is the secondary payor, and initial payment of CHAMPUS benefit is not authorized. (iii) Eligibility for Medicare Part J 3 , \"Supplementary Medical Insurance.\" Any person age 65 years or over may elect to purchase Medicare Part B coverage whether or not they are eligible for Part A. Entitlement to coverage only under Medicare Part B does not result in a loss of CHAMPUS eligibility. How\u00ad ever, in every instance of double coverage with Medicare Part B, Medicare is the primary payor and CHAMPUS is the secondary payor and initial payment of CEilMPUS benefits is not authorized. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 18021 (e) Title X IX of the Social Security Act, as Amended: Medicaid. Medicaid is essentially a welfare program, pro\u00ad viding medical benefits for persons under various state welfare programs (such as Aid to Dependent Children) Or who qualify by reason of being determined to be \"medically indigent\" based on a means test. It is not the intent of CHAMPUS to require any class of bene\u00ad ficiary to resort to welfare programs be\u00ad fore payment of CHAMPUS benefits. Therefore, for the purpose of this section, entitlement to Medicaid is not considered to constitute double coverage. (1) Medicaid: CHAMPUS Always Primary Payor. Whenever a CHAMPUS beneficiary is also eligible for Medicaid, CHAMPUS is in every instance the pri\u00ad mary payor. This applies to all classes of CHAMPUS beneficiaries, i.e., depend\u00ad ents of active duty members, retirees, dependents of retirees, dependent of deceased active duty members and de\u00ad pendents of deceased retirees. (2) Medicaid Payments Made in Er\u00ad ror. In those instances where Medicaid extends benefits on behalf of a Medicaid eligible person who is subsequently de\u00ad termined to be a CHAMPUS beneficiary, CHAMPUS shall reimburse the ap\u00ad propriate Medicaid agency for such amount as CHAMPUS would have paid in the absence of Medicaid benefits, under the following conditions: (i) Reimbursement Requirements. The documentation required in order for CHAMPUS to make reimbursement to a Medicaid agency shall be established by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a des\u00ad ignee), and must provide sufficient in\u00ad formation to permit the proper deter\u00ad mination of the applicable CHAMPUS benefit. (ii) Time Limit on Reimbursement. It is the responsibility of the appropriate Medicaid agency to determine such other health and medical coverage under which a Medicaid-eligible person may also seek reimbursement for medical services and supplies. In order to re\u00ad ceive reimbursement from the CHAMPUS Program for Medicaid bene\u00ad fits paid in error on behalf of a per\u00ad son subsequently determined to be a CHAMPUS beneficiary, the appro\u00ad priate Medicaid agency must submit a request for reimbursement no later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the medical service and/or supply was provided. (f) Veterans Benefits. All CHAMPUS benefits are specifically excluded for any medical service and/or supply provided a CHAMPUS beneficiary in the treat\u00ad ment of a military service-connected ill\u00ad ness or injury. Medical care for service- connected disabilities is specifically pro\u00ad vided for under another Government 57\u00b0fra^n set forth in CHAPTER 17, Title k ' 4?n^e < ^ States Code and administered D y \"he Veterans Administration. (1) IVo Option. The CHAMPUS bene- , ciary may not elect to waive his or her benefits in favor of using CHAMPUS. (2) Beneficiary Responsibility. It is the responsibility of the CHAMPUS bene-ficiary to make application to the Vet\u00ad erans Administration for medical care related to service-connected illness or injury. Failure to make application and/or failure to comply with the proce\u00ad dures established by the Veterans Ad\u00ad ministration in order to qualify for vet\u00ad erans benefits, does not in any way change the CHAMPUS exclusion for service-connected illness or injury. (3) Dispute as to Whether Service- Connected. The Veterans Administra\u00ad tion shall have final authority in the determination of whether or not an ill\u00ad ness or injury is, in fact, service- connected. In those disputed cases where it is determined by the Veterans Admin\u00ad istration that an illness or injury is not service-connected, CHAMPUS will as\u00ad sume the case and benefits for otherwise covered services and/or supplies may be extended. - Note.\u2014Such decisions are limited to cases involving a substantive determination re\u00ad lated to the medical condition in dispute. It does not include decisions on nonavail\u00ad ability of veterans benefits because of tech\u00ad nical reasons (i.e., non-compliance with required procedures). (4) Paid in Error. Any CHAMPUS benefits extended for medical care subse\u00ad quently determined to be related to a service-connected illness or injury shall be recouped. (Refer to \u00a7 199.13 \"Claims Submission, Review and Payment.\") (g) Workmen's Compensation. All CHAMPUS benefits are specifically ex\u00ad cluded for any medical \u00a1service and/or supply provided a CHAMPUS beneficiary in the treatment of a work-related (i.e., occupational) illness or injury for which benefits are available under applica\u00ad ble workmen's compensation benefits (whether applied for or paid). (1 y No Option. The CHAMPUS bene\u00ad ficiary may not elect to waive his or her workmen's compensation benefits in favor of using CHAMPUS. (2) Beneficiary Responsibility. It is the responsibility of the CHAMPUS beneficiary to make application for workmen's compensation benefits for medical care in connection with a work- related (i.e., occupational) illness or in\u00ad jury. Failure to make application and/or failure to comply with the procedures established to qualify for workmen's compensation benefits does not in any way change the CHAMPUS exclusion for work-related (i.e,. occupational), illness or injury. (3) Dispute as to Whether Work- Related. The agency having authority to do so (as designated under the ap\u00ad plicable workmen's compensation law, et al.), shall have final authority in the determination of whether or not an ill\u00ad ness or injury is, in fact, work-related (i.e., occupational). In those disputed cases where it is determined by the workmen's compensation agency that an illness or injury is not work-related, CHAMPUS will assume the case and benefits for otherwise covered services and/or supplies may be extended. Note.\u2014Such decisions are limited to cases involving a substantive determination re\u00ad lated to the medical condition in dispute.It does not include decisions on nonavail\u00ad ability of workmen's compensation benefits because of technical reasons (i.e., non- compliance with required procedures). (4) Exhaustion of Workmen's Com\u00ad Benefits. If workmen's compensation benefits, CHAMPUS will assume the case and benefits for other\u00ad wise covered services and/or supplies may be extended providing the following conditions are met: (i) Written Request Required. The CHAMPUS beneficiary must furnish such written documentation as is neces\u00ad sary to the fact that the workmen's compensation benefits have been exhausted. (ii) Lump Sum Settlement. The work\u00ad men's compensation benefits did not cease to be available because of a lump sum settlement between the CHAMPUS beneficiary and the workmen's compen\u00ad sation agency. If the workmen's com\u00ad pensation case was settled on the basis of an award or a lump sum settlement, whether or not an amount was specified for medical expenses, CHAMPUS bene\u00ad fits will not become available until such time as the CHAMPUS beneficiary fur\u00ad nishes written documentation that he or she has incurred expenses for medical services and/or supplies in connection with the work-related condition for which the lump sum award was made, equal to the amount of the award desig\u00ad nated for medical expenses (or, if no such designation was made, equal to the full amount of the award). At that time, CHAMPUS will assume the case and ex\u00ad tend benefits for otherwise covered serv\u00ad ices and supplies. (5) Special Assistance Where Length of Time Involved Is Extensive. In work\u00ad men's compensation cases which involve a lengthy investigation by the applicable workmen's compensation agency before a decision can be made as to whether a case is, in fact, work-related, or an un\u00ad usual delay because the CHAMPUS bene\u00ad ficiary elects to appeal an adverse deci\u00ad sion the workmen's compensation agency, CHAMPUS benefits may be ex\u00ad tended for otherwise covered services and supplies when authorized by the Di\u00ad rector, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), and provided the following conditions are met: (i) Written Request Required. The CHAMPUS beneficiary makes a request in writing. (ii> Agreement with Agency. The ap\u00ad propriate workmen's compensation agency agrees in writing that in the event a favorable decision is made, CHAMPUS will be reimbursed up to the extent of an award, but not to exceed the amount of benefits provided by CHAMPUS. (iii) Preauthorization Required. Agreement to make such payment is au\u00ad thorized by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee), prior to the extension of CHAMPUS benefits. (6) CHAMPUS Benefits Extended in Error. In those instances where, in error, CHAMPUS initially extends benefits in a case subsequently determined to be FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 18022 RULES AND REGULATIONS work-related (i.e., occupational) and thus recoverable under the applicable workmen's compensation law, or in such event CHAMPUS payments extended under paragraph (g) (5) of this section (because of administrative error on the part of the workmen's compensation agency) are not refunded to CHAMPUS by the workmen's compensation agency, standard recoupment procedures will be followed. (h) General Provisions. The following general provisions shall be followed in the administration of this \u00a7 199.14, \"Double Coverage.'' (1) Double Coverage Plan: No Coordi\u00ad nation of Benefits (or Similar) Provi\u00ad sion. When a double coverage plan does not contain a coordination of benefits (or similar) provision, such double cov\u00ad erage plan shall automatically be the primary payor and CHAMPUS the sec\u00ad ondary payor. (2) Exclusionary Clause. The fact that a double coverage plan has an exclusion\u00ad ary clause which precludes payment of benefits as a \"primary payor\" if the in\u00ad sured is covered under a Federal health and medical benefits program is not recognized, except as specifically set forth in paragraph (d) (2) of this section, and the other provisions of this section shall be applied in the same manner as in the absence of such exclusionary clause. (3) Double Coverage Information. It is the responsibility of the CHAMPUS beneficiary (or sponsor) to provide com\u00ad plete information related to double cov\u00ad erage in order to permit proper adjudica\u00ad tion of claims in accordance with the provisions of this section. (Also refer to \u00a7 199.13, \"Claims Submission, Review and Payment\".) (4) Erroneous Payments: Recoup\u00ad ment. Any CHAMPUS payments made in error relative to double coverage shall be recouped under one of the following pro\u00ad cedures: (i) Reimbursement from Double Cov\u00ad erage Plan. In those instances where the double coverage plan has not already made its benefit payment to the bene\u00ad ficiary and/or provider. CHAMPUS con\u00ad tractors or OCHAMPUS will request di\u00ad rect reimbursement. (ii) Refund or Offset. If the double coverage plan has made its benefit pay\u00ad ment prior to receiving the CHAMPUS request for reimbursement, the recoup\u00ad ment procedures set forth in \u00a7 199.13, \"Claims Submission, Review and Pay\u00ad ment\" will be followed. (5) No Option. A CHAMPUS bene\u00ad ficiary may not elect to waive benefits under his or her double coverage plan and use CHAMPUS. In all instances which are not benefits under both visions of this section will be applied. (6) Benefit Application\u2014(. i) Benefits Not Available Under Both Double Cov\u00ad erage Plans. Services and/or supplies which are not benefits under both CHAMPUS and the double coverage plan will not be coordinated. (ii) Secondary Payor: Limitations. CHAMPUS cannot pay more as a sec\u00ad ondary payor than it would have as aprimary payor; nor can CHAMPUS pay\u00ad ments be made as a secondary payor for any services or supplies which are not otherwise covered under the Program. Application of double coverage provi\u00ad sions does not extend or add to the CHAMPUS benefits as otherwise set forth in this and other sections of this regulation. (i) Program for the Handicapped. The Program for the Handicapped was estab\u00ad lished by Congress to be a source of financial assistance in those instances where an active duty member's handi\u00ad capped dependents have, by virtue of residency laws, been excluded from ap\u00ad propriate publicly operated programs or institutions for the handicapped. There is, therefore, a requirement that all local resources must be considered and utilized first, before CHAMPUS benefits under the Program for the Handicapped may be extended. If a handicapped CHAMPUS beneficiary is eligible for other Federal, state and/or local assistance to the same extent as any other resident or citizen, CHAMPUS benefits are not payable. The sponsor does not have the option of waiving available Federal, state, and/or local assistance in favor of using CHAMPUS benefits. (j) Implementing Instruction. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee) shall issue a CHAMPUS Operating Man\u00ad ual and such other instructions, proce\u00ad dures, guidelines, etc., as may be neces\u00ad sary to implement the intent of this section. \u00a7 199.15 Federal Medical Care Recovery Act. (a) General. The Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (FMCRA) (42 U.S.C. 2651-2653) provides that in any case in which the United States is authorized or required by law to furnish hospital, medical, surgical, or dental care and treatment to a person who is injured or suffers a disease under circumstances creating tort liability in some third per\u00ad son to pay damages for that care, the United States has a right to recover from the third person the reasonable value of the care and treatment fur\u00ad nished or to be furnished. E xam ple .\u2014A beneficiary is injured in an au\u00ad tomobile accident caused by another person and the beneficiary requires medical care. The Government, under FMCRA, may re\u00ad cover from the negligent party the reason\u00ad able value of the medical treatment pro\u00ad vided. This includes care that may be re\u00ad ceived by the beneficiary at a Uniformed Services facility or under CHAMPUS, or both in some instances. (b) The Relationship Between the Government and the Patient. The Gov\u00ad ernment's right to recover the amounts expended for the patient's medical care is independent of the right the patient himself has to assert a claim against the third person for damages. The existence of the Government's right, however, is dependent' upon establishing liability of the third person under ordinary prin\u00ad ciples of law; i.e., upon providing that the third person tortiously caused the injury. The attorney for the injured beneficiary may also agree to representthe Government, and join both claims in a single action against the third per\u00ad son. If the attorney for the injured bene\u00ad ficiary does not wish to join the Govern\u00ad ment's claim with that of his or her client, and court action is required to recover the amount expended for the pa\u00ad tient's medical care, intervention or an independent suit will be initiated by the United States for the reasonable value of the care or treatment provided. (c) Value of care. The Office of Man\u00ad agement and Budget has established rates for medical care provided by Uni\u00ad formed Service facilities. For care in ci\u00ad vilian facilities, the Government's CHAMPUS payment is used. The tient's share would re\u00ad main the patient's responsibility. Guid\u00ad ance in this area may be obtained from the appropriate Uniformed Service legal assistance officer. (d) Responsibility for recovery. The responsibility for recovering medical ex\u00ad penses incurred by the Government is that ol designated appropriate legal offi\u00ad cers of the Uniformed Services with the cooperation of the injured party. (1) Army. All major installations have an officer designated Recovery Judge Advocate. (2) Navy. The Naval Legal Service Of\u00ad fice responsible for the Claims Region in which the injury occurred. (3) Air Force. Staff Judge Advocate at Air Force installations, General Court Martial jurisdictions at Major Commands and the Claims and Tort Litigation Divi\u00ad sion, Headquarters USAF/JAGC, Wash\u00ad ington, D.C. 20314. (4) Coast Guard, Public Health Serv\u00ad ice, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Regional Attorney, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. (e) CHAMPUS Obligation to Notify Federal Claims Officer. In those instances where medical care is provided in civilian medical facilities and payment has been made for such care by a CHAMPUS Con\u00ad tractor, the CHAMPUS Contractor will promptly notify the appropriate claims officer in accordance with procedures es\u00ad tablished by the Director, OCHAMPUS. (f) Private Automobile Insurance: Federal Claims Collection Act. Automo\u00ad bile insurance is not generally considered a medical insurance program although such policies may include payment for medical care. However, any amounts paid by CHAMPUS for medical care arising out of an automobile accident when these same amounts are also payable, in whole or in part, under a policy of automobile insurance, may be subject to recovery under the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 951 SEQ.) The CHAMPUS Contractor therefore has a legal obliga\u00ad tion to report all such cases to the appro\u00ad priate legal departments of the Uni\u00ad formed Services for appropriate recovery action. \u00a7 199.16 Appeal and hearing proce\u00ad dures. (a) General. This section establishes and explains the procedures for review of benefit decisions by OCHAMPUS and by CHAMPUS Contractors who, under con- FEDERAl REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 18023 tract to OCHAMPUS, perform certain work in administering the CHAMPUS benefits. In the course of administering the CHAMPUS benefits, certain decisions are made by OCHAMPUS and by its CHAMPUS Contractors. Where these de\u00ad cisions affect the rights or liabilities of beneficiaries, their sponsors or partici\u00ad pating providers of services, the affected parties may request a reconsideration or appeal in accordance with this section. Actions under this section will be con\u00ad fined to benefit issues arising out of de\u00ad terminations based upon CHAMPUS regulations and relate only to the spe\u00ad cific dispute being considered. Actions under this section cannot be used to challenge such Regulations. (b) Definitions. As used in this sec\u00ad tion, the following definitions apply: (1) Days. \"Days\" means calendar days. (2) Appealing Party. \"Appealing Party\" means a CHAMPUS beneficiary (or sponsor), a participating provider of services affected by an initial determi- tion; or their representative. In addi\u00ad tion, an appealing party includes a pro\u00ad vider (or representative) that has been denied approval by CHAMPUS as an authorized provider. (3) Party to a hearing. \"Party to a Hearing\" means an appealing party or parties and CHAMPUS. (4) Participating provider. \"Partici\u00ad pating Provider\" means a hospital or other authorized institutional provider, a physician or other authorized individual professional provider, or other author\u00ad ized provider, which/who furnished serv\u00ad ices or supplies to a CHAMPUS bene\u00ad ficiary and has agreed, by act of signing and submitting a CHAMPUS claim form, to accept the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable cost/charge as the total charge (even though less than the actual billed amount), whether paid for fully by the CHAMPUS allowance or requir\u00ad ing cost-sharing by the beneficiary (or sponsor). (5) Representative. \"Representative\" means any person who has been ap\u00ad pointed by the appealing party as counsel or advisor, or who is otherwise eligible to serve as the appealing party's counsel or advisor, particularly in connection with a hearing. To avoid conflict of interest situations, an employee or Uniformed Service staff member of the Department of Defense, OCHAMPUS or the Offices of the Army, Navy or Air Force Surgeon General, or Office of the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service, a CHAMPUS Liaison Officer, a CHAMPUS Advisor or an employee or. Uniformed Service staff member of a Uniformed Service legal office (or similar function), subject to the exception in 18 U.S.C. 205, n\u00b0t eligible to serve as a \"Representative\". (6) Initial Determination. \" Initial De\u00ad termination\" means a formal decisioh on the part of an individual in a CHAMPUS Contractor's office or in OCHAMPUS who has reviewed a claim or a formal re\u00ad quest for benefits under a provision of this Program. An initial determination roay be in the form of a payment or re- jection (in part or whole) of a claim; orapproval or disapproval of an applica\u00ad tion for a benefit; or a termination of a benefit- There must be an adverse initial determination before a reconsideration and/or appeal can be initiated. (7) Amount in Dispute. \" Amount in Dispute\" means the amount of money owed by or paid by a CHAMPUS bene\u00ad ficiary for medical services and/or sup\u00ad plies, specifically in connection with the appeal situation. In determining the amount, only those charges which are related to potentially coverable services and supplies can be included. Further, in the same computation, only the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable charge/cost amounts will be considered to be in disput\u00e9 for purposes of determin\u00ad ing whether or not an appeal can be filed. Note.\u2014Few purposes of this Regulation, a provider appealing a denial by CHAMPUS as an authorized provider, shall always be deemed to have met any required \"Amount in Dispute.\" Further, this same principle will be applied in reviewing an appeal of a denial of a request for preauthorization un\u00ad less it* can be demonstrated by CHAMPUS that the CHAMPUS-determined cost/charge involved in such request would be less than the required level of \"Amount in Dispute.\" (c) Types of Initial Determinations. Initial determinations are made by CHAMPUS Contractors and OCHAMPUS (including OCHAMPUSEUR). (1) CHAMPUS Contractors. CHAM PUS Contractors initially make the fol\u00ad lowing determinations: (i) Individual Beneficiary. With re\u00ad spect to an individual beneficiary: (a) Whether the individual who ob\u00ad tained CHAMPUS benefits under the CHAMPUS Basic Program was an eligi\u00ad ble CHAMPUS beneficiary as defined in \u00a7 199.9 \"Eligibility,\" at the time services and supplies were obtained; (b) Whether coverage of services and supplies furnished is authorized under either \u00a7 199.10 or \u00a7 respectively; (c) Whether a physician's certificate is required and where applicable, whether the Treatment Plan (Basic Program Benefits) or Manag\u00e8ment Plan (Program for the Handicapped) is being properly followed; (d) Whether items or services are ex\u00ad cluded from coverage or otherwise limited in terms of coverage; (e) Whether the provider's bill or other evidence of payment due, or made, for authorized benefits received is accepta\u00ad ble; and (/) The amount of an applicable de\u00ad ductible or cost share.

(2) OCHAMPUS. OCHAMPUS (or a designee) makes the following initial determinations: (i) Individual Beneficiaries. With re\u00ad spect to individual beneficiaries: (a) Whether to approve preauthoriza\u00ad tion requests for inpatient admissions to authorized institutions other than hospi\u00ad tals and skilled nursing facilities, and for cosmetic, reconstructive and/or plastic surgery, and for adjunctive dental care; (b) Whether to authorize extended in\u00ad patient care over 30 days (extended in\u00ad patient care is also subject to periodic review as determined by OCHAMPUS); and (c) Whether to approve all (initial and. reapprovals) coverage under the Pro\u00ad gram for the Handicapped.

For those beneficiaries under 18 years of age, notice to the spon\u00ad sor or guardian constitutes notice to the beneficiary. Payment of a claim, .along with the CHAMPUS Explanation of Benefits form (CEOB), constitutes noti\u00ad fication. In each instance when a CHAMPUS claim is adjudicated, a CEOB is sent to the beneficiary/patient (or sponsor). A copy of the CEOB is also sent to the provider if the claim was sub\u00ad mitted on a participating basis (refer to \u00a7 199.13, \"Claims Submission, Review and Payment.\" ) Where an initial de\u00ad termination results in the disallowance of a claim in whole or in part, the notice of determination shall inform the bene\u00ad ficiary (and, if participating, the pro\u00ad vider) of the right to an informal re\u00ad view if the beneficiary (or sponsor) or participating provider is dissatisfied with the determination and that a request for informal review must be initiated within 180 days.

[FR Doc.77-7834 Filed 4-1-77;8:45 am] FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 PART III CO M M U N ITY SER V IC ES A D M IN IST R A T IO N F E D E R A L G R A N T S Uniform Federal Standards 18034 RULES AND REGULATIONS Title 45\u2014 Public Welfare CHAPTER X\u2014 COMMUNITY SERVICES ADMINISTRATION PART 1050\u2014 UNIFORM FEDERAL STANDARDS On January 17,1977, CSA published in the Federal Register interim regulations implementing eleven of the fifteen Uni\u00ad form Federal Standards promulgated by OMB Circular A-110 and FMC 74-7 to be effective April 1,1977. Comments on the interim regulations were invited. Comments were received from the Executive Director, Human Services Inc., Columbus, Indiana; the Di\u00ad rector, Finance and Data Processing, Total Action Against Poverty in Roanoke Valley, Roanoke, Virginia; and the Ad\u00ad ministrator of Sponsored Programs, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. The questions raised, suggested changes, notations of ambiguities or con\u00ad tradictions, etc., were insightful and most helpful and a number of the policy state\u00ad ments have been revised as a result of these comments and those received from two CSA Regional Directors. In order to facilitate the public's use of the standards as implemented by CSA, the agency is hereby republishing each of the eleven standards regardless of whether or not a particular policy had been changed subsequent to publication on January 17,1977. A. Following are substantive changes made to the interim regulations resulting from comments received. 1. Section 1050.40\u2014Program Income: Wording has been added to section 2.c. of Attachment A to provide flexibility to the CSA administering office to determine in what grant period earned program in\u00ad come will be used therefore clarifying that the income need not be used in the program year that it was earned. 2. Section 1050.50\u2014Cost Sharing and Matching: Wording has been added to allow, under certain circumstances, non- Federjal funds contributed to pay salaries in excess , of $15,000 to be counted to\u00ad ward the non-Federal share require\u00ad ment. It is also noted in the revision that general revenue sharing funds now are acceptable for use as matching. 3. Section 1050.60\u2014Standards for Fi\u00ad nancial Management: Section 1050.61 (a) (8) as published in the interim regu\u00ad lations noted that audits performed by grantees must include an appropriate sampling of CSA grants and other agree\u00ad ments. This has been changed to read Federal grants since that is the intent of the standards. However, it is possible that, due to the legislative requirement that audits be performed at least an\u00ad nually, a grantee may request an au\u00ad ditor to examine CSA agreements only. In this case the audit would be limited to a sampling of CSA agreements. A notation to this effect has also been add\u00ad ed to \u00a7 1050.61(a) (8). 4. Section 1050.90\u2014Payment Require\u00ad been revised to conform to \u00a7 1050.10 and now indicates that only in certain instances will sepa\u00ad rate bank accounts be required when a grantee is issued a letter-of-credit.5. Section 1050.110(b)\u2014 Grant Close\u00ad out Procedures: The word \"immediately\" has been deleted and wording added to require that a check for all unobligated funds accompany the final financial re\u00ad port due 90 days after the termination date of a grant. B. The following procedural change has been made: 1. Section 1050.90\u2014Payment Require\u00ad ments: \u00a7 1050.93(b) (2) has been changed to require that the written justification requesting special checks be submitted to the appropriate CSA administering office rather than directly to Headquar\u00ad ters. The administering office will re\u00ad view the request and, if approval is rec\u00ad ommended, then will submit grantee's request to Headquarters. C. The following recommendations were carefully reviewed and considered but were not'accepted for the reasons noted: 1. Section 1050.115-8 (d )\u2014Suspension and Termination Procedures: The rec\u00ad ommendation that the policy re place of termination hearings be changed to re\u00ad quire that it be at the grantee's main of\u00ad fice location is rejected because the pres\u00ad ent statement does not preclude this lo\u00ad cation but grants the responsible CSA official flexibility in fixing the time and place. 2. Section 1050.113(b)\u2014Grant Close\u00ad out Procedures: The recommendation that the final audit be submitted 180 days after completion of a grant rather than 90 days is not accepted since it is not an annual audit but a final audit and therefore does not require the extensive review of an annual audit. Also the sub\u00ad mission date coincides with all otlfer final reporting requirements which are conditions of the grant. 3. Section 1050.22\u2014Length of Reten\u00ad tion Period Records): Grantee re\u00ad spondent noted that there seems to be no procedure for notifying the grantee that an audit has been satisfactorily closed and therefore there would seem to be no point in time at which the three year retention period would start for records affecting a grant which has au\u00ad dit problems. Grantee official suggests that regulations be included in \u00a7 1050.22 to insure that the grantee is. notified when an audit is closed. This section is left unchanged as there are procedures in place in each Regional Office where\u00ad by a letter is forwarded to the grantee by the appropriate CSA Regional Audit Review Group noting disposition of the questioned items. 4. Section 1050.57(3)\u2014Cost Matching and Sharing: The recommendation that OMB be requested to allow pooling of non-Federal share among all the Federal programs operated by a grantee regard\u00ad less of funding source is rejected since it is, in the opinion of the CSA General Counsel, not permissible under the pro\u00ad visions of the Economic Opportunity Act. The final regulations published herein will be forwarded to all CSA grantees in the form of CSA Instructions. They cur\u00ad rently are at the printer and should be in the mail within a few weeks. A supplyof the new Standard Forms 269, 272, and 272A will accompany that mailing. In the meantime, a small supply is available at each CSA Regional Office. With the changes noted above the in\u00ad terim regulations are adopted as CSA policy as set forth below. Effective date: April 1, 1977. Robert C. C hase , Acting Director. 45 CFR Chapter X is amended by add\u00ad ing a new Part 1050 entitled \"Uniform Federal Standards\" and by adding the following to that Part: 1.

Subpart A to Part 1050 is revised to read as follows: Subpart A\u2014 Implementation of Uniform Federal Standards by Administration (CSA is applicable to all grants and other agreements made under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended, to public and private organiza- tions/agencies, including those serving as delegate agencies, when the assistance is administered by the Community Serv\u00ad ices Administration.\u00a7 1050.3 Exceptions to the Uniform Federal Standards. (a) For classes of grantees. Neither CSA nor any other Federal agency can apply more restrictive or differing re\u00ad quirements on a class of grantees unless ,<1) a statute expressly prescribes policies or specif! 3 requirements that differ from the standards or (2) the agency has re\u00ad ceived approval from the Office of Man\u00ad agement and Budget. (b) For certain grantees. CSA may impose additional requirements on in\u00ad dividual grantees if the grantee has a history of poor performance, is not fi\u00ad nancially stable, or its management sys\u00ad tem does not meet the standards set forth in Part 1050. In those instances CSA _iust inform the grantee in writing as to (1) why the additional standards are being imposed and (2) what correc\u00ad tive action is needed. Copies of such noti\u00ad fications must be sent to OMB and other agencies funding the grantee at the same time the grantee is notified. \u00a7 1050.4 Definitions of terms as used in this part. (a) The term \"grant\" means money or property provided in lieu of money paid or furnished by grantees under programs that provide financial assistance or that provide support or stimulation to ac\u00ad complish a public purpose. The term \"other agreements\" does not include contracts which are required to be en\u00ad tered into and administered under pro\u00ad curement laws and regulations. Grants and other agreement exclude (1) techni\u00ad cal assistance programs, which provide services instead of money, (2) assistance in the form of general revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, or insurance, and (3) direct payments of any kind to in\u00ad dividuals. (b) The term \"grantee\" is used by CSA in lieu of \"recipient\" and includes the following types of nonprofit organiza\u00ad tions that are receiving Federal funds from a Federal agency or through a State or local government: (1) Public and private institutions of higher education: public and private hospitals; and other quasi-public and private nonprofit organizations such as (but not limited to) community action agencies, research institutes, educational associations, and health centers. In addi\u00ad tion, for purposes of this part, it includes private-for-profit organizations fundedunder Title V II of the EOA. The term does not include foreign or international organizations (such as agencies of the United Nations) and Government-owned contractor-operated facilities or research centers providing continued support for mission-oriented, large scale programs that are Government-owned, or are designed as federally-funded research and development centers. (c) The term \"delegate agency\" is used by CSA in lieu of \"subrecipient\" and means a public or private agency, in\u00ad stitution or organization or a State or other political jurisdiction to which the development, conduct and administra\u00ad tion of all or part of a project assisted under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended, has been delegated by a grantee or by another agency or or\u00ad ganization which has received as\u00ad sistance by or through a grantee, but does not include individuals who ulti\u00ad mately receive benefits under any pro\u00ad gram or assistance. \u00a7 1050.5 Implementing Schema. (a) Responsibilities. OMB Circular A-110 and FMC 74-7 (Cir. A-102) require all Federal agencies administering pro\u00ad grams that involve grants and other agreements with grantees to issue ap\u00ad propriate implementing regulations. (b) Publication formats. As with all policy statements CSA is issuing its im\u00ad plementing regulations both in the Fed\u00ad eral Register and as part of the CSA directives system. However, a separate Part (1050) has been established in the Code of Federal Regulations within which all Uniform Federal Standards and accompanying CSA policies and procedures will be published. Also, in the CSA directives system the 6800 series will be used exclusively for promulgation of the standards. Each standard will be issued as a separate CSA Instruction within that series with accompanying CSA implementing policies and proce\u00ad dures (if required) to be issued as an At\u00ad tachment to the appropriate Instruction. As a further means of more easily identifying the standards, CSA will de\u00ad viate from its normal practice of using yellow stock to identify policy state\u00ad ments and will publish the standards on blue stock. (c) Cross Reference Index. Following is an index which provides a cross refer\u00ad ence to CSA implementing regulations: \u00a71050.2 Purpose. The purpose of Part 1050 is to set forth the Uniform Federal Standards pursuant to OMB Circular A-110 and FMC 74-7 (A-102) and to provide grantees with CSA's policies and procedures imple\u00ad menting those standards the goal of which is to obtain consistency and uni\u00ad formity among Federal agencies in the administration of grants to, and other agreements with, units of local and State Government, public and private institu\u00ad tions of higher education, public and pri\u00ad vate hospitals, and other quasi-public and private non-profit organizations.Attachments to\u2014TitleImplementing regulations OMB circular A-110FMC 74-7 CS A reference A A Cash Depositories.... ............... _............. . 6 8 0 0 -2 1 0 5 0 .1 0B B Bonding and Insurance ........................ ......... 6 8 0 0 -3 1 0 5 0 .1 5C C Retention and Custodial Requirements for Records.6 8 0 0 -4 1 0 5 0 .2 0 D E Program Income ............. ............... ........ 6 8 0 0 -5 1 0 5 0 .4 0E F Cost Sharing and Matching .............. ......_____ 6 8 0 0 -6 1 0 5 0 .5 0F G Standards for Financial Management Systems... 6 8 0 0 -7 1 0 5 0 .6 0G H Financial Reporting Requirements .................. 6 8 0 0 -8 1 0 5 0 .7 0H I Monitoring and Reporting Program Performance. 6 8 0 0 -9 1 0 5 0 .8 0I J Payment Requirements .......... ...................... 6 8 0 0 -1 0 1 0 5 0 .9 0J K Revision of Financial Plans ......... .................. 6 8 0 0 -1 1 1 0 5 0 .1 0 0K L Closeout Procedures ........... ;................. ....... 6 8 0 0 -1 2 1 0 6 0 .1 1 0L L Suspension and Termination Procedures... ....... 6 8 0 0 -1 3 1 0 6 0 .1 1 6M M Standard Form for Applying for Federal As\u00adsistance.6 8 0 0 -1 4 1 0 5 0 .1 2 0 N N Property Management Standards ......-........... . 6 8 0 0 -1 5 1 0 9 0 .1 3 00 O Procurement Standards. ............. ................ 6 8 0 0 -1 6 1 0 6 0 .1 6 0 FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 18036 RULES AND REGULATIONS 3. This subpart sets forth standards governing the use of banks and other in\u00ad stitutions as depositories of fluids un\u00ad der grants and other agreements pur\u00ad suant to OMB Circular A-110 and Fed\u00ad eral Management Circular 74-7. In the past CSA has required separate bank ac\u00ad counts for CSA grant funds. This is now changed in that CSA, or any other Fed\u00ad eral grant-making agency, can not re\u00ad quire segregation for cash depositories. Other provisions in this subpart are in line with past CSA policy. Subpart B to Part 1050 is revised to read as follows: Subpart B\u2014 (Uniform Federal 1050.10 Physical segregation and eli\u00ad in \u00a7\u00a7 1050.11,1050.12 and 1050.13 the Com\u00ad munity Services Administration does not: (a) Require physical segregation of cash depositories for CSA funds which are provided to a grantee. (b) Establish any eligibility require\u00ad ments for cash depositories for CSA funds which are provided to a grantee. \u00a7 1050.11 Letter of credit\u2014 checks paid basis. A separate bank account is required when applicable letter-of-credit agree\u00ad ments provide that drawdowns will be mg/te when the grantee's checks are pre\u00ad sented to the bank for payment. \u00a7 1050.12 FDIC insurance coverage. Any monies advanced to a grantee which are subject to the control or reg\u00ad ulation of the United States or any of its officers, agents or employees' (public monies as defined in Treasury Circular No. 176, as amended) must be deposited in a bank with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance coverage and the balance exceeding the FDIC coverage must be collaterally secured. \u00a7 1050J3 Minority-owned banks. Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees and dele\u00ad gate agencies are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). 4. This subpart sets forth bonding and insurance requirements for grants and other agreements with grantees pursu\u00ad ant to Attachment B of Circular A-110 and Attachment B to FMC 74-7. As of the effective date of this subpart public agencies receiving CSA funds for the first initial grant will no longer be Re\u00ad quired to submit assurance of bonding (except for construction or facility im\u00ad provements) to CSA. However, as in the past nongovernmental grantees will con\u00ad tinue to be required to submit such no\u00ad tice of bonding. Coverage, length of du\u00ad ration, and responsibility vis-a-vis dele\u00ad gate agencies also continue to reflect the policies previously published in OEO In\u00ad struction 6809-01. Public grantees should take note of their continuing responsibil\u00adities vis-a-vis nongovernmental delegate agencies. Subpart C to Part 1050 re\u00ad vised to read as f ollows: Subpart C\u2014 Bonding (Uni\u00ad form Federal Standard) Instruction 6800-3) \u00a7 1050.15 References. (1) OMB Circular A-110, Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Ed\u00ad ucation, Hospitals, and Other Nonprofit Or\u00ad ganizations (Attachment B ). (2) FMC 74-7, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants-in-Aid to State and Local Governments (Attachment B ). (3) CSA Instruction 6710-6, Applying for a grant under Title VH of the Community Services Act. (4) CSA Instruction 6710-8, Preparing a Budget for a Title V II grant under the Com\u00ad munity Services Act. (5) CSA Instruction 6143-la, Emergency Energy Conservation Program (45 CFR 1061.30). \u00a7 1050.16 Standard. (a) In administering CSA grants, grantees shall observe their regular re\u00ad quirements and practices with respect to bonding and insurance. CSA will not impose additional bonding and insurance requirements including fidelity bonds, except as provided in (b) through (d) below. (b) Construction and facility im\u00ad provement. The recipient of a CSA grant which requires contracting or facility improvement (including any CSA grant which provides for alterations or renova\u00ad tions of real property) shall .follow its own requirements and practices relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds except for contracts exceeding $100,000. For contracts ex\u00ad ceeding $100,000, CSA may determine that the grantee's bonding provisions adequately protect the Federal Govern\u00ad ment's interest; otherwise the minimum requirements shall be as follows: (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The bid guarantee shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check or other negotiable in\u00ad strument accompanying a bid as assur\u00ad ance that the bidder will upon accept\u00ad ance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within, the time specified. (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A performance bond is one executed in connection with a con\u00ad tract to secure fulfillment of all the con\u00ad tractor's obligations under the contract. (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A payment bond is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. (c) Loan guarantees. Where in con\u00ad nection with a CSA grant, CSA also guarantees the payment of money bor\u00ad rowed by the grantee, CSA may, at its discretion, require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the grantee are notdeemed adequate to protect the interests of the Federal Government. (d) Fidelity bonds. If the grantee is a nongovernmental organization, CSA re\u00ad quires adequate fidelity bond coverage. (e) Source of bonds. Any bonds ob\u00ad tained pursuant to (b)(1) through (3), (c) or (d) shall be obtained from com\u00ad panies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties (31 CFR 223). \u00a7 1050.17 CSA implementing policies and procedures. (a) Policy. OMB Circular A-110 per\u00ad mits Federal agencies to require fidelity bond coverage of its nongovernmental grantees if the bonding and insurance requirements of the grantee are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government. Therefore, CSA will require evidence of appropriate bonding or assurance that arrangements have been made to obtain such coverage in line with the following policies and procedures. (1) Bond coverage of officials. \u2014 (i) Assurance of fidelity bond coverage. (A) Prior to the release of funds to any non\u00ad governmental grantee for the first initial grant CSA must receive written assur\u00ad ance that the grantee has or has made arrangements for appropriate bonding of grantee officials. This assurance will take the form of a letter from a bond\u00ad ing company or agent stating the type of bond, amount and period of coverage, positions covered, and the annual cost of the bond that has been obtained. (ii) Coverage. In all other situations, nongovernmental grantees must either have secured or must take steps to secure fidelity bond coverage in line with the following guides: (A) Coverage should be seemed in the aggregate amount of $25,000 for persons authorized to sign or countersign checks or to disburse sizeable amounts of cash (such as for payrolls). Persons who han\u00ad dle only petty cash need not be bonded. Nor is it necessary to bond officials who are authorized to sign Payment Vouch\u00ad ers, but who are not authorized to sign or countersign checks or to disburse cash. (B) Grantees normally should obtain a 3 year bond, payable annually, with an option to cancel in the event the pro\u00ad gram terminates before three years. Such terms are available from most surety companies. (iii) Responsibility vis-a-vis delegate agencies. Grantees\u2014both public and pri\u00ad vate\u2014are responsible for assuring that appropriate officials of nongovernmental delegate agencies are bonded. Coveragi for officials of delegate agencies which are private organizations shall be equal to the average of funds to be expended each month (up to an aggregate amount of $25,000.) If a delegate agency will ex\u00ad pend less than $1,000 per month in pro\u00ad gram funds, on the average, bond cover\u00ad age is not required. (b) Procedures . Copies of bonds se\u00ad cured by the grantee and by. delegate agencies should be filed by the grantee and need not be submitted to CSA. (c) Affect of this Subpart on other CSA Policies and Procedures, ill 9 \u00ae \u00b0 Instruction 7570-1, pp. 17 and 18, item FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 18037 11.(3) Bonding: The three paragraphs are superseded and the sentence \"See In\u00ad struction 6800-3 regarding applicability of bonding requirements and proce\u00ad dures.\" should be inserted. (2) OEO Instruction 7570-2, p. 7, item 8.b: Th\u00e8 period at the end of the sen\u00ad tence is deleted and the sentence \" (See CSA Instruction 6800-3 regarding appli\u00ad cability of bonding requirements and procedures.) \" should be inserted. 5. The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the Uniform Federal Standard for the retention and custody of records in accordance with the provisions of ref\u00ad erences (1) and (2) of this subpart. This policy requires the revision of two existing CSA policies, OEO Instruction 6801-1 which currently requires a reten\u00ad period of five years' and CSA In\u00ad struction 7050-1 (General Conditions) which requires retention for 3 years after expiration of the grant. This subpart also details the starting date for the reten\u00ad tion period and who shall have access to records in order to make audits, exami\u00ad nations, excerpts and transcripts. This new policy statement does not af\u00ad fect IRS' requirement that all employ\u00ad ment tax records be kept for a period of at least four years, (OEO Instruction 6810-1, page 7). Nor does it affect the one year retention requirement of reports filed with the local office of the State em\u00ad ployment service as part of the program to assist Vietnam era veterans, (OEO In\u00ad struction 6901-2). 45 CFR Chapter X is amended by the following: Subpart D\u2014 Retention and Custodial Re\u00ad Standard) \u00a7 1050.20 References. (1) OMB Circular A-110, Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non\u00ad profit Organizations (Attachment C ). (2) FMC 74-7, Uniform Administra\u00ad tive Requirements for Grants-in-Aid to State and Local Governments (Attach\u00ad ment C ). (3) CSA Instruction 6800-5, Program Income (Uniform Federal Standard) (45 CFR 1050.40). (4) CSA Instruction 6800-15, Property Management Standards (Uniform Standard) (45 CFR 1050.130).

(6) OEO Instruction 6810-1, Grantee Compliance with IRS Requirements for Withheld Federal Income and Social Se\u00ad curity Taxes. (7) CSA Instruction 7050-1, General Conditions Governing CSA Grants Fund\u00ad ed Under Titles H, T T T -R and v n of the EOA of 1964 as amended (45 CFR 1067.5). \u00a7 1050.21 Documents affected. Financial records, supporting docu\u00ad ments, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to a grant are covered by the requirements in this subpart. \u00a7 1050.22 Length of retention period. Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and reference (6) FEDERAL(employer's tax records) , records shall be retained for three years. (a) I f any litigation, claim or audit by or on behalf of the Federal Government involving the records has not been fully resolved before the expiration of the three-year period, the records shall be retained until resolution or until the end of the regular three-year period, which\u00ad ever is later. In no case, however, will CSA require retention of records relating to any grant with respect to which ac\u00ad tions by the United States to recover for diversion of money paid under the grant are barred by the statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. 2415(b). That statute bars legal actions unless filed within six years after the right of action accrues. The six years excludes any periods in which the circumstances listed in 28 U.S.C. 2416 apply, e.g., material facts cannot be known, or a state of war exists. (b) In order to avoid duplicate record\u00ad keeping, CSA may make special arrange\u00ad ments with grantees to retain any records which are continuously needed for joint use. CSA will request transfer of records to its custody from grantees when it de\u00ad termines that the records possess long\u00ad term retention value. When the records are transferred to or maintained by CSA, the three-year retention requirement is not applicable to the grantee. \u00a7 1050.23 Starling date of retention period. (a) General. Except for records cov\u00ad ered by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section, where CSA grant support is con\u00ad tinued or renewed on an annual basis, the retention period for each year's rec\u00ad ords starts from the date of submission to CSA of the grantee's annual or last financial report for that year; in all other cases the retention period starts from the date 'of submission to CSA of the grant\u00ad ee's final financial report. (1) Records for non-expendable prop\u00ad erty. The retention period for records for non-expendable property required by reference (4) starts from the date of dis\u00ad position of the property. However, for property that has been replaced pursuant to reference (4), the retention period starts from the disposition of the replace\u00ad ment property. (2) Records pertaining to certain classes of income. For records that relate to classes of program income subject to reference (3), the three-year retention period starts from the date the income is earned. \u00a7 1050.24 Substitution of Microfilm. Microfilm copies may be substituted for the original records. \u00a7 1050.25 Access to records. (a) CSA and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their au\u00ad thorized representatives, shall have the right of access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of the grantee which are pertinent to a specific CSA grant, in order to make audits, examina\u00ad tions, excerpts and transcripts. (b) In case of a delegation under a CSA grant, CSA, the Comptroller Gen\u00aderal of the United States, the grantee, any intermediate delegate agency or any of their authorized representatives shall have the right of access, at any time prior to expiration of the retention pe\u00ad riod, to any books, documents, papers or other records of the ultimate delegate agency which any of them determines are pertinent to the CSA grant, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts and transcripts. (c) In the case of a contract (or sub\u00ad contract) under a CSA grant, CSA, the Comptroller General of the United States, the grantee, any intermediate delegate agency, contractor, or sub-con\u00ad tractor, or any of their authorized rep\u00ad resentatives shall have the right of ac\u00ad cess, at any time prior to expiration of the retention period, to any books, documents, papers or other records of the contractor or sub-contractor which any of them determines are pertinent to the CSA grant, in order* to make audits, ex\u00ad aminations, excerpts and transcripts. \u00a7 1050.26 Restrictions on public access. (a) Private Grantees. Unless other\u00ad wise required by law, CSA will not place restrictions on grantees which will limit public access to records covered by this subpart except when CSA has determined that the records must be kept confiden\u00ad tial and would have been excepted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act if the records had be\u00ad longed to CSA. (b) Public Grantees. Unless otherwise required by law, CSA will not place re\u00ad strictions on State and local govern\u00ad ments which will limit public access to the State and local governments' rec\u00ad ords except when records must remain confidential. Following are some of the reasons for withtholding records: (1) Prevent a clearly unwarranted in\u00ad vasion of personal privacy. (2) Specifically required by statute or Executive Order to be kept secret. (3) Commercial or financial informa\u00ad tion obtained from a person or a firm on a privileged or confidential basis. \u00a7 1050.27 CSA implementing policies and procedures. (a) Changes to Existing CSA Policy Statements. (1) Following are changes to be made to OEO Instruction 6801-1, page 10, item 6, second sentence: Everything ap\u00ad pearing after the word \" retained\" is deleted and the following inserted: * * * for the time period and in the man\u00ad ner prescribed by CSA's policy on retention and custodial requirements for records. (See CSA Instruction 6800-4.) (2) Following are changes to be made to CSA Instruction 7050-1, page 4, item 12, line 9: Everything appearing after the word \"retained\" is deleted and the following added: * * * for the time period and in the man\u00ad ner prescribed by CSA's policy on retention and custodial requirements for records. (See CSA Instruction 6800-4.) 6. The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the Uniform Federal Standard REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 18038 RULES AND REGULATIONS pursuant to OMB Circular A\u2014 110 and Federal Management Circular 74-7 and CSA's implementing policies and pro\u00ad cedures relating to program income, in\u00ad terest, and other monetary proceeds re\u00ad sulting from projects funded in whole or in partwith CSA grant funds. This sub\u00ad part reflects past CSA policy regarding the use of interest and program income, i.e. that interest must be returned to the Treasury (exception: States and their instrumentalities), and that program in\u00ad come may be retained by the grantee for specific uses. However, the Federal stand\u00ad ards include several policies which CSA has not previously enunciated and which should be noted: 1. a public grantee, after termination or completion of a grant must return to the Federal agency any royalties of $200 or more earned by the Federal share in the absence of other specific agreements between CSA and the grantee. 2. Interest earned will now be reported on a new Standard Form (SF 272) and program income on a new financial report form, SF\u2014 269 and on SF-272. 45 CFR Chapter X is amended by add\u00ad ing the following: Subpart E\u2014 \u00a7 1050.40 References.

Program income represents gross in\u00ad come earned by the grantee from CSA funded activities. Such earnings exclude interest earned on advances and may in\u00ad clude, but will not be limited to, income from service fees, sale of commodities, usage or rental fees, and royalties on patents and copyrights. \u00a7 1050.42 Standard. (a) Interest. Interest earned on ad\u00ad vances of Title n funds shall be remitted to the Community Services Administra\u00ad tion except for interest earned on ad\u00ad vances to States or instrumentalities of a State as provided by the Intergovern\u00ad mental Cooperation Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-577). (b) Program Income \u2014 (1) Sale of Real and Personal Property. Proceeds from the sale of real and personal prop\u00ad erty either provided by CSA or pur\u00ad chased in whole or in part with CSA funds shall be handled in accordancewith \u00a7 1050.130 (CSA Instruction 6800- 15). (2) Royalties earned from copyrights or patents, (i) Unless the grant provides otherwise, grantees shall have no obli\u00ad gation to the Community Services Ad\u00ad ministration with respect to royalties as a result of copyrights or patents produced under the grant. (See references (5) and (7).) (ii) However, in the case of public grantees, if after termination or comple\u00ad tion of the grant, there is an excess of royalties of $200 or more earned an\u00ad nually by the Federal share these sums shall be returned to CSA in the absence of other specific agreements between CSA and the grantee. (3) Other program income. All other program income earned during the proj\u00ad ect period shall be retained by the grantee and, in accordance with the grant, shall be: (1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Community Services Ad\u00ad ministration and the grantee and be used to further eligible program objectives; or (ii) Deducted from the total project cost in determining the net cost on which the Federal share of costs will be based. \u00a7 1050.43 CSA implementing policies and procedures. . (a) Policy \u2014 (1) Service fees. Under limited circumstances CSA may approve the charging of a fee to grantees of serv\u00ad ices supported with CSA funds. Such approval, however, does not allow the grantee to use Federal funds to produce income for the benefit of the grantee. (b) Procedures .\u2014 (1) Return of inter\u00ad est. Interest earned on the investment of CSA funds will be reported on SF-272, item 13.a (see reference (4 )) and apheck payable to the Treasurer of the United States for the earned interest should be attached to the report and sent to the CSA office responsible for administering the grant. (2) Return of royalties. Public grantees who have royalty fees which must be re\u00ad turned to CSA (see \u00a7 1050.42(b) (2 )) shall do so by forwarding a check, payable to the Treasurer of the United States, to the CSA office which had been respon\u00ad sible for administering the grant. (3) Other program income. The CSA office responsible for administering the grant will also be responsible for deter\u00ad mining the manner and grant period in which income retained by grantees is used within the constraints of the Stand\u00ad ard outlined in \u00a7 1050.42(b) (3). (4) Reporting program income. Pro\u00ad gram income will be reported on SF 269, Financial Status Report and on SF 272, Federal Cash Transactions. (See refer\u00ad ence (4).) 7. This subpart sets forth criteria and procedures pursuant to OMB Circular A-110 and Federal Management Circular 74-7 (OMB Circular A-102) for the al\u00ad lowability of cash and in-kind contribu\u00ad tions made by grantees and delegate agencies and criteria for the valuation of donated contributions such as per\u00adsonal services, property, etc. The Stand\u00ad ards set forth in this subpart and the accompanying CSA implementing poli\u00ad cies and procedures basically reflect the policy statements previously found in OEO Instruction 6802-la and CSA In\u00ad struction 6802-2 with three major excep\u00ad tions, i.e. there is no longer a prohibition against counting volunteer time of grantee staff and/or board members as a non-Federal share contribution when the services contributed are not required of individuals in their capacities as board members or staff; and, under certain circumstances, non-Federal funds con\u00ad tributed to pay salaries in excess of $15,000 may be counted toward the non- Federal share requirement; and general revenue sharing funds may now be used as the non-Federal matching share for other Federal grants. 45 CFR Chapter X is amended by deleting \u00a7 1068.9-1 through 9-5 and \u00a7 1068.10-1 subpart as follows: Subpart F\u2014 Cost Sharing Grants and Agree\u00ad ments with.

In-kind con\u00ad tributions may be in the form of charges for real property and non-expendable personal property, and the value of goods and services directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the project or program. \u00a7 1050.52 Standards. (a) Costs and contributions accepta\u00ad ble. (i) : Cost sharing or matching may consist of: (i) Charges incurred by the grantee as project costs. (Not all charges require cash outlays by the grantee dur\u00ad ing the project period: examples are de\u00ad preciation and use charges for building and equipment.) (ii) Project costs fi\u00ad nanced with cash contributed or donated to the grantee by other non-Pederal pub\u00ad lic agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals, except as provided in (t) below: (A) Generally, any funds provided for payment of salaries in excess of $15,000 shall not be counted as a non-Federal share contribution toward a Title II grant per Section 244(2) of the Eco\u00ad nomic Opportunity Act of 1964 as amended. However, these funds may be counted as a non-Federal share dona\u00ad tion in those cases \" * * * (particularly in large metropolitan areas) where, be\u00ad cause of the need for specialized or pro\u00ad fessional skills or prevailing local sal\u00ad ary levels, application of the * * * re\u00ad striction would greatly impair program effectiveness or otherwise be inconsist\u00ad ent with the purposes sought to be achieved.\" 1 Grantees who wish to re\u00ad quest such an exception will submit data and written justification to the appro\u00ad priate CSA Administering Office and the Administering Office's response shall be retained by the grantee for audit pur\u00ad poses. (B) Project costs represented by serv\u00ad ices and real and personal property, or use thereof, donated by other non-Fed\u00ad eral public agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals.2 \u00a7 1050.53 Qualifications. (a) All contributions, both cash and in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the grantee's cost sharing and matching 1 Section 244(2) of the EOA of 1964, as amended. 1 This includes volunteer services of board members. However, to be counted these serv\u00ad ices must be other than those required of them in their capacities as board members. For example, time spent at board or commit\u00ad tee meetings by a board member who is a doctor would not be acceptable but time spent by him/her working in a clinic would be accepted. This also aUows volunteer serv\u00ad ices of staff to be counted as non-Federal share when such services are not required by the positions they hold. (Grantees are re\u00ad minded that any work performed by staff members which is in line with the normal responsibilities of their positions and is in excess of the normal weekly working hours is covered by the CSA overtime regulations (see OEO Instruction 6900-01) and can not be considered as a non-Federal share. con\u00ad tribution.) FEDERALRULES AND REGULATIONS when such contributions meet all of the following criteria: (1) Are verifiable from the grantee's records; (2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally assisted pro\u00ad gram; (3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project objectives; (4) Ar\u00e9 types of charges that would be allowable under the applicable cost prin\u00ad ciples; (5) Are not paid by the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment under another assistance agree\u00ad ment unless the agreement is authorized by Federal law to be used for cost shar\u00ad ing or matching, e.g., General Revenue Sharing; Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-383; (6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by CSA; and (7) Conform to other provisions of this subpart. \u00a7 1050.54 Valuation in-kind contribu\u00ad tions will be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. \u00a7 1050.55 Valuation of third-party in- kind contributions. (a) Valuation of volunteer services. Volunteer services may be furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and un\u00ad skilled labor. Volunteer services may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and neces\u00ad sary part of an approved program. (1) Rates for volunteer services. Rates for volunteers should be consistent with those paid for similar work in the grantee's organization or which those paid for similar work in the labor mar\u00ad ket in which the grantee competes for the kind of services involved. (2) Volunteers employed by other or\u00ad ganisations. When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay (exclusive of fringe benefits and overhead costs) provided these services are in the same skill for which the em\u00ad ployee is normally paid. (b) Valuation of donated, expendable personal property. Donated, expendable personal property includes such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to ex\u00ad pendable personal property included in the cost or matching share should be reasonable and should not exceed the market value of the property at the time of the donation. (c) Valuation of donated, nonexpend\u00ad able personal property, buildings, and land or use thereof. (1) The method used for charging cost sharing or matching for donated nonexpendable personal property, buildings and land may differ according to the purpose of the grant or other agreement as follows:18039 (1) If the purpose of the grant or other agreement is to assist the grantee in the acquisition of equipment, build\u00ad ings or land, the total value of the do\u00ad nated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching. (ii) If the purpose of the agreement is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, de\u00ad preciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. The full value of equipment or other capital as\u00ad sets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed provided that the Community, Services Administration has approved the charges. (2) The value of donated property will be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the grantee with the following qualifications: (i) Land and buildings. The value of donated land and buildings may not ex\u00ad ceed its fair market value, at the time of donation to the grantee as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or GSA repre\u00ad sentatives) and certified by a responsible official of the grantee. (.iit Nonexpendable personal property. The value of donated nonexpendable personal property shall not exceed the fair market value of ^equipment and property of the same age and condition at the time of donation. (iii) Use of space. The value of do\u00ad nated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as es\u00ad tablished by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a pri\u00ad vately-owned building in the same lo\u00ad cality. (iv) Loaned equipment. The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value. \u00a7 1050.56 Supporting records for in- kind contribution from non-Federal third parties. (a) Volunteer services must be docu\u00ad mented and, to the extent feasible, sup\u00ad ported by the same methods used by the grantee for its employees. (See \u00a7 1050.- 57.) (b) The basis for determining the val\u00ad uation for personal services, material, equipment, buildings and land must be documented. (See \u00a7 1050.57.) \u00a7 1050.57 Share Requirements. 225(c), 235(b), and 714 of the Economic Oppor\u00ad tunity Act of 1964 as amended require the contribution of non-Federal share by grantees funded under Sections 221, 222 (a), 235, and 712 of that Act. In addi\u00ad tion the Director of the Community Services Administration may adminis\u00ad tratively require a non-Federal share contribution from grantees funded un\u00ad der other sections of the Act if the grants are administered by Community Services Administration. Policies and procedures implementing the legislative requirements of the Economic Opportu\u00ad nity Act will be found in references (3) through (6) of this subpart, REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 18040 RULES AND REGULATIONS - (b) Accounting for the non-federal share. (1) The Statement of C8\u00c1 Grant, Form 314, shows the minimum percent\u00ad age of total program expenditures which non-Federal funds must constitute in the grant period. The grantee is expected to maintain the rate of contribution of the non-Federal share so that through\u00ad out the grant period Federal funds will not be used to pay for a substantially larger percentage of project costs than the Federal funds shown on the State\u00ad ment of CSA Grant constitute. (2) It is important to note that the Federal share may never exceed either the dollar amount shown on the State\u00ad ment of CSA Grant or the maximum percentage of the total program expendi\u00ad tures that this constitutes. The grantee must provide only sufficient non-Federal contributions so that the Federal share remains at or below the maximum per\u00ad centage; however, the grantee may choose to provide additional non-Federal share, to insure a margin of safety, in the event that annual audits disallow some contributions. (3) The non-Federal share may be provided in one program account for the entire grant or it may be spread among several program accounts. (See reference (3) to this subpart.) (4) Non-Federal share contributions of cash shall be recorded as they occur. It is not necessary to maintain separate ledger accounts for the expenditures of grantee cash. (5) All in-kind contributions, includ\u00ad ing those applicable to delegate agencies, must be recorded in the ledger accounts, either in separate accounts or in separate Columns, as grant costs when the in-kind services or goods are performed or re\u00ad ceived. Records, including required sup\u00ad porting documentation, on in-kind serv\u00ad ices or goods performed or received must be established and maintained on a cur\u00ad rent basis. (6) The non-Federal share is subject to audit, as is the Federal share. (c) Required documentation \u2014Volun\u00ad teered services. All volunteered serv\u00ad ices claimed as non-Federal share must be substantiated by time cards or records that are signed by both the volunteer and his supervisor as is required for all other employees. Such records must show the actual hours worked and the spe\u00ad cific duties performed .They should also indicate the basis for determining the rate of volunteer's contribution and such documentation must be available for audit. (8) This subpart sets forth the standards for grantee financial manage- rrient systems pursuant to the Uniform Federal Standard contained in Attach\u00ad ment F of OMB Circular A -l 10 and At\u00ad tachment G of Federal Management Circular 74-7 and outlines CSA proce\u00ad dures to be followed in implementing the standards. The Uniform Federal Stand\u00ad ards in this subject area do not conflict with any policies, procedures or other requirements previously imposed by CSA nor do they impose any additional re\u00ad quirements.Subpart 6\u2014 Standards for Financial Man\u00ad agement Standard) (CSA Instruction 6800\u2014 7) \u00a7 1050.60 References.

(a) Following are the standards for financial management systems for grantees. (References (3) through (15) contain CSA's detailed implementing policies and procedures.) CSA will im\u00ad pose no additional standards on grantees unless they are specifically provided for in applicable statutes. Grantees' fi\u00ad nancial management systems will pro\u00ad vide for the following; (1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of each CSA sponsored project or program in accordance with the financial reporting requirements set forth in \u00a7 1050.70 (CSA Instruction 6800-8). (2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for CSA sponsored projects. These records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obliga\u00ad tions, unobligated balances, assets, out\u00ad lays and income. (3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Grantees shall ade\u00ad quately safeguard all such assets and shall assure, that they are used solely for authorized purposes. (4) Comparison of actual outlays with budget amounts for each grant or other agreement; Financial information should be related to performance and unit cost data.(5) Procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and the disburse\u00ad ment by the grantee, whenever funds are advanced by the Federal Government. When advances are made by a letter-of- credit method, the grantee shall make, drawdowns as close as possible to the\" time of making disbursement. [See \u00a7 1050.90 (Instructions 6800-10) letter-of-credit the reasonableness, allowability and alloca- bility of costs in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms of the grant or other agreement. (7) Accounting records that are sup\u00ad ported by source documentation. (8) Examinations in the form of au\u00ad dits or internal audits.1 Such audits shall be made by qualified individuals who are sufficiently independent of those' who authorize the expenditure of Federal funds, to produce unbiased opinions, conclusions or judgments. They shall meet the independence criteria along the lines of Chapter 3; Part 3 of the U.S. General Accounting Office publication, Standards for Audit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities and Functions. These examinations are in\u00ad tended to ascertain the effectiveness of the financial management systems, and internal procedures that have been es\u00ad tablished to meet the terms and condi\u00ad tions of the agreements. It is not intended that each agreement awarded to the grantee be examined. Generally examinations should be con\u00ad ducted on an organization wide basis to test the fiscal integrity of financial transactions, as well as compliance with the terms. and conditions of Federal grants and other agreements. Such tests will include an appropriate sampling of Federal agreements.2 Examination will be conducted with reasonable frequency on a continuing basis or at scheduled intervals but at least annually in accord\u00ad ance with reference (7) and Section 243 of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 as amended. (9) Audits to be made by the grantee or at his direction to determine, at a min\u00ad imum, the fiscal integrity of financial transactions and reports, and the com\u00ad pliance with laws, regulations, and ad\u00ad ministrative requirements. The grantee will schedule such audits annually in ac\u00ad cordance with reference (7) and section 243 of the Economic Opportunity Act of i964 as amended.3 1 Applicable to private grantees only. 2 Because Section 243 of the Economic Op\u00ad portunity Act of 1964, as amended, requires more frequent audits, i.e., at least annually, than that prescribed for grants funded by most other Federal agencies, the independ\u00ad ent auditor may be requested by the grantee to examine CSA agreements only. In those cases, of course, the audit would limit his/ her examination to CSA agreements an\u00ab would Include a sampling of CSA agreements only. 8 Applicable to public grantees only.

(b) Delegate agencies. Grantees shall require delegate agencies to adopt the standards in \u00a7 1050.61 (a) except for the requirement in (5), regarding the use of the letter-of-credit method and that part of (1) regarding reporting forms and frequencies prescribed in \u00a7 1050.70 (CSA Instruction 6800-8). \u00a7 1050.62 CSA implementing policies and procedures. (See references (3) through (15) of this subpart for CSA's implementing policies and procedures as they relate to the standards set forth in this subpart.) 9 . This subpart sets forth the stand\u00ad ards for grantee financial reporting as prescribed by Attachment G to OMB Circular A-1101 and Attachment H to PMC 74-7 (OMB Circular A-102) and CSA's procedures for completing SP 269, Financial Status Report; SF-271, Outlay Report and Report for Reimbursement of Construction Programs; and SP 272, Federal Cash Transactions Report. OMB Circular A-110 and PMC 74-7 prescribe new financial reporting forms to be used by all Federal agencies with grants-in- aid programs. Consequently, beginning with quarters ending April 30, 1977 CSA will require that grantees submit SP 269, Financial Status Report, to fulfill the quarterly financial reporting requirement in lieu of the currently used CSA Form 315. Grantees also will be required to sub\u00ad mit a new form SF-272, Federal Cash Transactions Report at the same time, but not necessarily with, the SF-269. There is an additional form (SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reim\u00ad bursement for Construction Programs) which may be used and/or required under certain circumstances as described in this subpart. Frequency of submission of the financial reports will not change nor will the distribution of such reports. An initial supply of Standard Forms 269 and 272 will be forwarded to grantees. They will accompany the standards when they are distributed in the form of CSA In\u00ad structions. Additional supplies of these and other referenced forms are available from the CSA Publications and Distribu\u00ad tion Center. Subpart H\u2014 6800-8) \u00a7 1050.70 References.

The portion of the funds authorized by CSA which has not been obligated by the grantee and is determined by deducting the cu\u00ad mulative obligations from the funds authorized. (j) Unliquidated obligations. Repre\u00ad sent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee which have hot been paid. (k) Program year. A grantee's 12- month accounting period. For Commu\u00ad nity Action Agencies this is the funding period for the principal grant that pro\u00ad vides funds for most of the grantee's ad\u00ad ministrative costs. For other agencies funded by CSA, this is their usual 12- month accounting period which may or may not correspond with funding period of their grant(s) from CSA. (l) Funding period. A program ac\u00ad count funding period extends from the18041 effective date of a new or refunding ac\u00ad tion through the termination date, dr expiration bf the planned number of months for which funds are provided. \u00a7 1050.72 Standard. (a) CSA will continue to utilize either the Letter of Credit or the predetermined monthly check issue as the two methods for making funds available to all con\u00ad struction and nonconstruction projects or programs. For the purpose of determin\u00ad ing the status of those funds and to in\u00ad sure sound cash management on the part of grantees and delegate agencies CSA requires the submission of the following quarterly reports: (1) Reports required. (A) Financial Status Report, SF 269 (for nonconstruc\u00ad tion projects or programs). (B) Federal Cash Transactions Re\u00ad port, SF 272 (and 272A\u2014Continuation Sheet, if necessary). (C) Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Pro\u00ad grams, SF 271 (for construction pro\u00ad grams only). (2) Preparation of reports. Reports may be prepared on either a cash or sftl accrual basis with the appropriate in\u00ad dication on the report as to the method utilized. In the event that CSA should require all reports to be submitted on an accrual basis grantees will not be re\u00ad quired to convert their accounting sys\u00ad tem, but shall develop such accrual in\u00ad formation through estimates based on an analysis of documentation on hand. (3) Submission. Reports are required within 15 working days after the end of each quarter of the grantees program year with a final report due within 90 days after the completion or termination of the grant. Extensions to reporting dates may be approved upon request of the grantee. CSA may require monthly reports from grantees with awards of $1 million or more annually. (b) SF 272, report of Federal cash transactions. (1) CSA will use this re\u00ad port to monitor cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement in\u00ad formation for each agreement from the grantees. (2) CSA requires that grantees indicate in the \"remarks\" section of the SF 272 report the reason(s) for having and the need for retaining a cash bal\u00ad ance of Federal funds in excess of cur\u00ad rent operating needs. For grantees on Letter of Credit current needs will relate to the amount of time required to fully effect a draw down in order to meet daily disbursement requirements. For grantees on monthly check issue current cash needs will mean a cash balance no greater than is necessary to meet ' operating requirements. (c) Additional reporting requirements. When CSA needs additional information or more frequent reports in order to comply with legislative requirements or to monitor a grantee that has failed to meet the Standard for Financial Man\u00ad agement as defined in CSA Instruction 6800-7, CSA will, prior to making any such request, adhere to the requirements imposed by OMB Circular No. A-40. (d) CSA has the option of shading out any line item on any report that is un\u00ad necessary for decision-making purposes. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1977 18042 RULES AND REGULATIONS (e) CSA will accept the identical in\u00ad formation from grantees in machine, usable format or computer printouts in lieu of prescribed formats. (f) CSA may provide computer out\u00ad puts to grantee when it will expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. (g) CSA is authorized to reproduce these forms. \u00a7 1050.73 CSA implementing policies and procedures. (a) Policy. (1) If any CSA regulation prescribes policies or requirements that differ from the provisions provided herein, the provisions of this subpart shall govern.

Subpart t\u2014 Monitoring and Reporting Program Performance [Reserved] 11. This subpart establishes the re\u00ad quired methods of making payments to grantees pursuant to the Uniform Fed\u00ad eral Standards contained in Attachment I of OMB Circular A-110 and Attach\u00ad ment J of Federal Management Circular 74-7. These methods will minimize the time elapsing between the disbursement by grantees and the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury to grantees whether such disbursement oc\u00ad curs prior to or subsequent to the trans\u00ad fer of funds. The Uniform Federal Stand\u00ad ards allow payments to a grantee by two methods which are currently used by CSA, i.e. Letter of Credit (for total pay\u00ad ment of $250,000 or more), and advance by Treasury check (for payments less than $250,000) . Therefore, the attached subpart does not make any substantive change to any CSA policy or procedures.

(a) Letter-af-Credit. A Letter-of- Credit is an instrument certified by an authorized official of a Federal funding agency that authorizes a grantee to draw funds when needed from the Treasury, through a Federal Reserve bank and the grantee's commercial bank, in accord\u00ad ance with the provisions of Treasury Circular No. 1075, as revised. <b) Advance by Treasury check. An ad\u00ad vance by Treasury check is a payment made hy a Treasury check to a grantee upon its request before outlays are made by the grantee or through the use of predetermined payment schedules. (c) Reimbursement by Treasury cheek. A reimbursement by Treasury check is a Treasury check paid to a grantee upon request for reimbursement from the grantee. S' 1030.92 Standard. (a) Payments, can be made to grantees through a ltetter-of-credit and an ad\u00ad vance by Treasury check. (b) Except for construction grants and other construction agreements for which optional payment methods are author\u00ad ized, as described in paragraph (d) of this section; the: letter-of-credit method shall be used by CSA if all of th\u00e9 follow\u00ad ing conditions exist: (!) If there is or will be a continuing relationship between a grantee and CSA for a least a 12 month period and the total amount of advance payments ex\u00ad pected to be received within that period from CSA is $250,000 or more, as pre\u00ad scribed by Treasury Circular No. 1075. For joint funded projects the Treasury has authorized a dollar criteria of $120,000 . (2) If the grantee has established or demonstrated to CSA the willingness and ability to maintain procedures that will minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and their disbursement by the grantee. (3) If the grantee's financial manage\u00ad ment system meets the standards for fund control and accountability pre\u00ad scribed in 45 CFR 1050:60 for Financial Management Systems.) <e> The method of advancing funds by Treasury cheek shall be used, in accord\u00ad ance with the provisions of Treasury Circular No. 1075, when the grantee meets all of the requirements specified 4, 1977 RULES AND REGULATIONS 18043 in paragraph (b) of this section, except those in paragraph (b) (1) of this section. (d) A reimbursement by Treasury check shall be the preferred method if the grantee does not meet the require\u00ad ments specified in paragraphs (b) (2) and (b) (3) of this section. At the option of CSA this method may also be used on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the program is accom\u00ad plished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assist\u00ad ance constitutes a minor portion of the program. When the reimbursement method is used, CSA shall make payment within thirty days after receipt of the billing unless the billing is improper. (e) When the letter-of-Credit proce\u00ad dure is used, the grantee shall be issued one consolidated letter-of-credit when\u00ad ever possible to cover anticipated cash needs for all grants and other agree\u00ad ments awarded by the sponsoring agency. (f) (1) Unless otherwise required by law, CSA shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by grantees at any time during the project or program period unless (i) a grantee has failed to comply with the program objectives, gen\u00ad eral or special conditions, or CSA report\u00ad ing requirements; or (ii) the grantee is indebted to the United States, and collec\u00ad tion of the indebtedness will not impair accomplishment of the objectives of a project or program sponsored by the United States. (See \u00a7 1050.110 and \u00a7 1050.115 (CSA Instructions 6800-12 and 6800-13) for procedures in cases of close\u00ad outs, suspensions and terminations). (2) Under such conditions, CSA may, upon reasonable notice, inform the grantee that payments will not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment is liquidated. \u00a7 1050.93 CSA implementing policies and procedures. (a) Policy. Federal funds awarded un\u00ad der CSA grants will be made available (advanced) by letter of credit or by check, depending upon the amount of the grant. Funds for grants of less than $250,000 annually will be advanced by the periodic issuance of Treasury checks. Funds for grants of over $250,000 \"and where there is an anticipated continuing relationship for one year will be made available through the issuance of a Treasury Department Letter of Credit. (b) Grants under $250,000 annually. (1) Fund advances for grants totaling less than $250,000 annually will be made by a monthly check to the grantee. The amount of the monthly check will be computed based upon a grantee's antici\u00ad pated rate of expenditure over the period of the grant, and subject to adjustment cased upon an analysis of the required quarterly financial reports from the grantee, All Treasury checks will reflect ne grantee number and the grant action which the funds pertain. In the event subsequent funding actions result in a foe? s annual funding level to exceed f S ? 00, he wU1 be notified that his n n H P r o c e d u r e s are to be changed t necessary forms for conversion sent ^ \u00b0* * \"!re<^ Procedures will be F E D E R A L(2) Special checks, (i) When a grantee anticipates needing cash in excess of that provided by the issuance of a monthly check, he must submit a written justifi\u00ad cation to the appropriate administering office for review and subsequent submis\u00ad sion to the Finance and Grants Manage\u00ad ment Division, Headquarters, if approval is recommended. (ii) Before approving issuance of a special check, the Finance and Grants Management Division will review current expenditure rates and cash balances re\u00ad ported on the financial reports. Delays in submission of these reports to CSA will result in delays in approval of spe\u00ad cial checks. (c) Grants over $250,000 annually. When a letter-of-credit is issued the grantee will not be required to maintain a separate bank account for funds ob\u00ad tained in this manner except in those cases where the letter-of-credit agree\u00ad ment provides that draw downs will be made when the grantee's checks are pre\u00ad sented to the bank for payment. Grant\u00ad ees will delay, to the extent possible, all drawdowns on the letter-of-credit until after their organizations have issued checks for disbursements properly chargeable to Federal funds. (1) Letter of credit procedure \u2014 (i) Selection of commercial bank. (A) Grantees shall select a commercial bank which will agree to receiv\u00e8 Payment Vouchers cm Letter of Credit (TUS 5401) drawn on the Treasurer of the United States and forward these vouchers to the applicable Federal Reserve Bank or branch. In addition the grantee will as\u00ad sure that they comply with the Uniform Federal Standards applying to cash de\u00ad notify the Finance and Grants Management Division, CSA Headquarters, of the name of the commercial bank, title of the bank account, and location of the applicable Federal Reserve Bank or branch. (ii) Authorized signature card. (A) The Finance and Grants Management Division in Headquarters or Financial Services Branch in the regions will send the grantee three Standard Forms 1194, Authorized Signature Card for Payment Vouchers on Letters of Credit, as part of the grant package. When properly completed by the grantee, these cards will provide the appropriate Federal Re\u00ad serve Bank or branch with specimen sig\u00ad natures of grantee officials authorized to sign Payment Vouchers on Letter of Credit or withdrawal of funds. A sample copy of SF 1194 and instructions for completion are provided in Exhibit H. (B) Two copies of the properly com\u00ad pleted signature card will be returned, with all other required documents, to the Finance and Grants Management Division, CSA Headquarters, or to the Financial Service Branches in regional offices, depending on whether the grant is administered by CSA Headquarters or by a regional office. (Cl A change of persons authorized to sign payment vouchers or a change in grantee name, address, or commercial bank will require that a grantee submit a new set of signature cards to the Head\u00adquarters Finance and Grants Manage\u00ad ment Division. Blank signature cards may be obtained from that office or from the Financial Services Branches in the regional offices. (D) The Finance and Grants Man\u00ad agement Division, or the Financial Serv\u00ad ices Branches for regional grants, will notify the grantee when the signature cards and letter of credit have been sent to the Federal Reserve Bank or Branch via the Treasury Department. The grantee will not present a payment voucher which includes the new or changed information until: it has received such notification. The grantee should as\u00ad sure that it has sufficient funds for oper\u00ad ating until receipt of the notification. (E) Each letter of credit must have its own signature card. If there is a need to change a prior signature card for a specific grant, a new signature card must be submitted to the Finance and Grants Management Division, CSA Head\u00ad quarters. (F) Grantees must provide signatures for at least two persons in order to enable the proper completion of the payment voucher (Form TUS 5401). (1) Withdrawal of funds, (i) As funds are needed, the grantee will prepare and submit the original, duplicate, and tripli\u00ad cate copies of the Payment Voucher on Letter of Credit (Forms TUS 5401) to its commercial bank. The commercial bank will transmit all forms to the Federal Reserve Bank or branch. The recipient organization will retain the quadruplicate copy for its own records. Instructions for preparing the form are provided in Exhibit III. (ii) A supply of Forms TUS 5401 will be sent to each grantee with the letter- of-credit. Additional forms may be ob\u00ad tained by writing to the Finance and Grants Management Division, CSA Headquarters. Payment vouchers are preprinted with CSA's name and station symbol. They cannot be used for with\u00ad drawals from letters-of-credit issued by other Federal agencies. Only Forms TUS 5401 received from CSA may be used for withdrawal of funds from CSA letters- of-credit. (H i) Guidelines for withdrawal. The U.S. Treasury Department policy pro\u00ad vides that withdrawals by grantees shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and shall be timed to be in accord with only the actual cash requirements needed in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. Where a grantee makes advances to a delegate agency, they shall conform substantially to the- same standards of timing and amount as applicable to advances to the primary grantee. Grantee drawdowns shall not ordinarily be made more fre\u00ad quently than daily in order to maintain a minimum amount of cash on hand. However, the amount withdrawn may not exceed the dollar limitation placed on the letter-of-credit by CSA without prior CSA approval. Ordinarily, withdrawals should not be made for less than $10,000 nor for more than $1,000,000, and in no case in excess of $5,000,000 unless au\u00ad thorized by CSA, and should never exceed the amount of cash needed to operate for a thirty (30) day period.

(a) \"Closeout\"\u2014The closeout of a grant Is the process by which CSA deter\u00ad mines that all applicable administrative actions and all required work of the grant have been completed by the grantee and CSA. (b) \"Date of completion\"\u2014The date of completion is the date on which all work under the grant is completed or the date on the grant award document, or any supplement or amendment thereto, on which Federal assistance ends. (c) \"Disallowed costs\"\u2014Disallowed costs are those charges to a grant which CSA determines to be unallowable in ac\u00ad cordance with the applicable Federal cost principles, other conditions contained in the grant agreement and CSA Instruc\u00ad tions. \u00a7 1050.112 Standards. The following requirements shall be applicable to the closeout of all CSA grants: (a) Upon request, CSA shall make prompt payments to the grantee for al\u00ad lowable reimbursable costs under the grant being closed out. (b) Within 90 calendar days after com\u00ad pletion of a grant, the grantee shall re\u00ad fund any balance of unobligated cash that CSA has advanced or paid, and that is not authorized to be retained by the grantee for use in other grants or for other purposes specifically authorized in writing by CSA. A check (payable to CSA) will accompany the final financial report. (See reference (7) for proce\u00ad dures.) (c) Within 90 calendar days after the completion of a grant, the grantee shall submit to CSA all financial, perform\u00ad ance, and other reports required as con\u00ad ditions of the grant. (See references (7), and (8), and (13) for procedures.) CSA may grant extensions when requested by the grantee. (d) When authorized by the grant agreement, CSA shall make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustment to the Federal share of costs after these reports are received. (e) The closeout of a grant shall not, of itself, end or otherwise affect: (1) T\" e grantee's responsibility to account for any property acquired with F e d e r a l funds, or received from the Government, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 1050.130 (CSA Instruction 6800-15) Property Management Standards; (2) The grantee's responsibility to ac\u00ad count for program income in accordance m lfV \u00bb t V v A v w m r i p i A v i e ftf' \u00a3 (CSA Instruction 6800-5) ; (3) The retention period for, or Fed\u00ad eral rights of access to, grant recor\u00fbs pursuant to \u00a7 1050.20 (CSA Instruction 6800-4).

Procedures for various activities to be undertaken in closeouts will be found in references (3) through (14). This subpart provides additional detail on required closeout procedures relating to audits. (See reference (13) for basic procedures.) (b) Closeout Audits \u2014 (1) Scope of Au\u00ad dit. (i) Within 90 days after the date of completion of a CSA grant, the grantee will be required to submit a final audit of grant operations. This audit will be done in accordance with the Accounting System Survey and Audit Guide, CSA Manual 2410-1. If the grantee will no longer be receiving CSA funds from other grants, the scope of audit should be adjusted as follows: (A) The independent auditor will not be required to render an appraisal of the grantee's accounting system and internal controls. However, he will be required to review internal accounting controls in accordance with generally accepted aud\u00ad iting standards to ascertain the degree of reliance he can place on them in de\u00ad termining the extent of his audit tests and procedures. Therefore, the audit re\u00ad port will noiflfiially contain no comments or recommendations relative to the grantee's accounting system or internal controls. (B) The independent auditor should explain in his audit report that the gran\u00ad tee will not continue to receive CSA funding and will not be involved in CSA Programs as a grantee. (C) The independent auditor should emphasize in his report any action re\u00ad quired to clear the account such as re\u00ad covery of any unexpended funds or dis\u00ad position of grant property. di) Where questions arise in regard to the audit of CSA grantees being closed out, independent auditors should contact the cognizant CSA Regional Auditor for guidance. _(2) Audit disallowances. The normal CSA audit disallowance procedures as set forth in reference (13) shall be fol\u00ad lowed for audit disallowances resulting trom a final audit. Final audit disallow\u00ad ances can only be satisfied by cash pay\u00ad ments to CSA when the grant in question nas been or is in the process of being closed out. 1 4 . This subpart prescribes uniform uspension and termination procedures ior all CSA grants pursuant to the Uni- Affm , ^deral Standards contained in L of OMB Circular A-110 .ra! Management Circular 74-7 (OMB Circular A - 102) . S Previous policy statement and . H ropanying procedures re suspension s i U e, rmination was found in 45 CFR \u00ab 1 (OEO Instruction 6730-2) which s superseded by this subpart (CSA In- FEDERALRULES AND REGULATIONS struction 6800-13). However, most of the policies and procedures found in 45 CFR \u00a7 1067.1 have been incorporated into pro\u00ad cedures include: General: Terminology has been cor\u00ad rected but very few substantive changes have been made. Procedures have not changed. Specific: Suspension, \u00a7 1050.115-7: (1) Length of suspension increased from 21 to 30 days; (2) Regional Directors explicitly added to definition \u00a9 ^'respon\u00ad sible CSA official\" but only for purpose of suspensions; (3) suspension procedures have been reorganized into two sec\u00ad tions\u2014suspension on notice and sum\u00ad mary suspension. Termination, \u00a7 Re\u00ad gional Directors as well as \"responsible CSA official\" may initiate termination, but Regional Directors may not conduct termination hearing, unless designated by the responsible CSA official, since they are not grant making officials; and (2) a final section entitled \"Consequences of Termination\" was transferred from CSA Instruction 7050-1, General Condition 14, to subsection 8(j) of this subpart. 45 CFR Chapter de\u00ad M\u2014 Suspension and Termination Procedures (Uniform Federal Standard) (CSA Instruction 6800-13) \u00a7 1 0 5 0 .1 1 5 \u2014 1 References.

(a) \"Termination\"\u2014The termination of a grant is the cancellation of Federal assistance, in whole or in part, under a grant at any time prior to its date of completion. The following do not consti\u00ad tute termination: (1) Withdrawal of funds awarded on the basis of grantee's under estimate of the unobligated balance in a prior grant period; (2) Failure on the part of CSA to re\u00ad fund a grantee or to make a continua\u00ad tion, extension, supplemental or other additional grant; (3) Withdrawal of the unobligated bal\u00ad ance as of the date of completion of a grant pursuant to the provision of CSA Instruction 6800-12 (45 CFR 1050.110); (4) Annulment of a grant upon deter\u00ad mination that the grant was obtained fraudulently or yras otherwise illegal or invalid from inception; (5) Withdrawal of unobligated funds from a CAA before the date of comple\u00ad tion of its gragt as a result of opt-out or de-designation proceedings under Section 210 of the Economic Opportunity J REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL18047 Act of 1964 as amended, and OEO In\u00ad struction 6302-2. (b) \"Suspension\"\u2014The suspension of a grant is an action by CSA that tem\u00ad porarily suspends Federal assistance under the grant, pending a decision by CSA to terminate the grant. \u00a7 1050.115\u2014 3- Failure to comply with grant terms and conditions. When a grantee has materially failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a grant (including all applicable CSA Instructions), CSA may suspend the grant in accordance with \u00a7 1050.115-4, terminate it for cause in accordance with \u00a7 1050.115-5, or take such other remedies as may be legally available and appropri\u00ad ate under the circumstances. \u00a7 1050.115\u2014 4 Suspension. When a grantee has materially failed to comply with grant terms and condi\u00ad tions, CSA may suspend the grant, after giving the grantee reasonable notice and opportunity to show cause why the grant should not be suspended. Pursuant to sec\u00ad tion 604 (2) of the Economic Opportunity Act as amended, CSA may summarily suspend a grant without previous notice in an emergency situation. If a grant is suspended, CSA may withhold further payments and prohibit the grantee from incurring further obligations of funds, pending corrective action by the grantee or a decision by CSA to initiate termina\u00ad tion proceedings in accordance with \u00a7 1050.115-5. CSA will allow all necessary and proper costs that the grantee could not reasonably avoid during the period of suspension, provided that they meet the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles (for public grantees, the ap\u00ad plicable provisions are those of Federal Management Circular 74-4). \u00a7 1050.115\u2014 5 Termination for cause. Whenever it is determined that a grantee has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of its grant, CSA may terminate the grant in whole or in part at any time prior to its date of com\u00ad pletion. CSA shall promptly notify the grantee of the determination and the reasons for the termination, together with its effective date. Pursuant to sec\u00ad tion 604(3) of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended, such deter\u00ad mination shall not be made unless the grantee has been afforded the oppor\u00ad tunity for a full and a fair hearing on the termination of its grant. Payment made to grantees or recoveries by CSA or other Federal grantor agencies under grants terminated for cause shall be in accordance with the legal rights and liabilities of the parties. \u00a7 1050.115\u2014 \u00a3 Termination for conven\u00ad ience. CSA or the grantee may terminate any grant in whole or in part if and only if both parties agree that the con\u00ad tinuation of the project would not pro\u00ad duce beneficial results commensurate with the further expenditure of funds. The two parties must agree on the ter\u00ad mination conditions, including the ef\u00ad fective date, and, in the case of partial [;' 1977 18048 RULES AND REGULATIONS terminations, the portion to be termi\u00ad nated. H ie grantee shall not incur- new obligations for the terminated program or portion thereof after the effective date of termination and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. CSA shall allow full credit to the grantee for the Federal share of the noncancellable obligations properly incurred by the grantee prior to the effective date of termination. \u00a7 1050.115\u2014 7 CSA implementing poli\u00ad cies and procedures governing sus\u00ad pensions. (a) Purpose and scope. (1) This sec\u00ad tion established rules for the suspension of assistance provided under the Eco\u00ad nomic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended (hereinafter the Act), if the assistance is administered by the Com\u00ad munity Services Administration; a grantee may be suspended for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of its grant, including applicable laws, regulations, CSA Instructions, grant conditions, or approved work programs. (21 ) However, this section shall not apply to any administrative action of the Community Services Administration based upon any violation or alleged vio\u00ad lation of Title V I of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; in case of such violation or alleged violation the provisions of 45 CFR 1010 (CSA Instruction 6004-01a) shall apply. (3) Pursuant to section 604(2) of the Act and this subpart, the responsible CSA official may suspend a grant under the circumstances outlined in paragraph (a )(1 ) of this section. There are two kinds of suspension; (i) suspension on notice, as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, and (ii) summary sus\u00ad pension as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section. Summary suspension may be invoked only when the respon\u00ad sible CSA official determines that an emergency situation exists (see para\u00ad graph (d) (1) of this section.) (b) Definitions. (1) The term \"re\u00ad sponsible CSA official\" means the Direc\u00ad tor, Deputy Director, and any other offi\u00ad cial who is authorized to make the grant in question, the Regional Director of the Regional Office administering the grant in question, or the designee of any of these officials. (2) The term ''summary suspension\" means suspension of a grant without prior notice to the grantee. (c) Suspension on notice. (. 1) The re\u00ad sponsible CSA official shall notify the grantee by letter or telegram that CSA intends to suspend a grant in whole or in part unless good cause is shown why the grant should not be suspended. In such letter or telegram the responsible CSA official shall specify the grounds for the proposed suspension and the pro\u00ad posed effective date of the suspension. (2) The responsible CSA official shall also inform the grantee of its right to submit written material in opposition to the intended suspension and of its right to request an informal meeting at which the grantee may respond an attempt to show why such suspension should not occur. The period of time within whichthe grantee may submit such written material or request the informal meeting shall be established by the responsible CSA official in the notice of intent to sus\u00ad pend. However, in no event shall the pe\u00ad riod of time within which the grantee must submit written material or request such a meeting be less than 5 days after the notice of intent to suspend has been sent. If the grantee requests a meeting, the responsible CSA official shall fix a time and place for the meeting, which shall not be less than 5 days after the grantee's request is received by CSA. (3) In lieu of the provisions of para\u00ad graph (c) (2) of this section dealing with the right of the grantee to request an informal meeting, the responsible CSA official may on his own initiative estab\u00ad lish a time and place for such a meeting. However, in no event shall such a meet\u00ad ing be scheduled less than 7 days after the notice of intent to suspend is sent to the grantee. (4) The responsible CSA official may in his discretion extend the period of time or date referred to in the previous para\u00ad graphs of this section and shall notify the grantee of any such extension. (5) At the time the responsible CSA official sends the notification referred to in paragraph (c ), (1), (2), and (3) of this section to the grantee, he shall also send a copy of it to any delegate agency whose activities or failures to act are a substan\u00ad tial cause of the proposed suspension, and shall inform such delegate agency that it shall be entitled to submit writ\u00ad ten material or to participate in the in\u00ad formal meeting referred to in paragraph (c ),' (2) and (3) of this section. In addi\u00ad tion, the responsible CSA official may in his discretion give such notice to any other delegate agency. (6) Within 3 days of receipt of the no\u00ad tice referred to in paragraphs (c) (1), (2) , and (3) of this section the grantee shall send a copy of these regulations to all delegate agencies which would be fi\u00ad nancially affected by the proposed sus\u00ad pension action. Any delegate agency that wishes to submit written material may do so within the time stated in the no\u00ad tice. Any delegate agency that wishes to participate in the informal meeting with the responsible CSA official contemplated herein (if not afforded a right to partici\u00ad pate under the previous paragraphs) may request permission to do so from the responsible CSA official, who may in his discretion grant or deny such per\u00ad mission. In acting upon any such request from a delegate agency, the responsible CSA official shall take into account the effect of the proposed suspension on the particular delegate agency, the extent to which the meeting would become unduly complicated as a result of granting such permission, and the extent to which the interests of the delegate agency request- in such permission appear to be ade\u00ad quately represented by other partici\u00ad pants. (7) In the'notice of intent to suspend assistance the responsible CSA official shall invite voluntary action to ade\u00ad quately correct the deficiency which led to the initiation of the suspension pro\u00ad ceeding.. (8> The responsible CSA official shall consider any timely material presented to him in writing, any material presented to him during the course of the informal meeting provided for in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section as well as any showing that the grantee has adequately corrected the deficiency which led to the initiation of suspension proceedings. If after considering the material presented to him the responsible CSA official con\u00ad cludes that the grantee has failed to show cause why the grant should not be suspended, he may suspend the grant in whole or in part and under such terms and conditions as he shall specify. (9) Notice of such suspension shall be promptly transmitted to the grantee and shall become effective upon delivery. Sus\u00ad pension shall not exceed 30 days unless during such period of time termination proceedings are initiated in accordance with \u00a7 1050.115-8, or unless the responsi\u00ad ble CSA official and the grantee agree to a continuation of the suspension for an additional period of time. If termination proceedings are initiated, the suspension shall remain in full force and effect until such proceedings have j been fully concluded. (10) During a period of suspension no new expenditures shall be made and no new obligations shall be incurred in con\u00ad nection with the suspended program ex\u00ad cept as specifically authorized in writing by the responsible CSA official. Expendi\u00ad tures to fulfill legally enforceable com\u00ad mitments made prior to t\u00a3e notice of susension, in good faith and in accord\u00ad ance with the grantee's approved work program, and not in anticipation of sus\u00ad pension or termination, shall not be con\u00ad sidered new expenditures. However, funds shall not be recognized as com\u00ad mitted solely because the grantee has ob\u00ad ligated them by contract or otherwise to a delegate agency. No t e.\u2014Willful misapplication of funds may violate section 627 of the Economic Op\u00ad portunity Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2971(f) or other criminal statutes. (11) The responsible CSA official may in his discretion modify the terms, con\u00ad dition and nature of the suspension or rescind the suspension action at any time on his own initiative or upon a showing satisfactory to him that the grantee has adequately corrected the deficiency which led to the suspension and that repetition is not threatened. Suspensions partly or fully rescinded may in the discretion of the responsible CSA official be reimposed with or without further proceedings: Provided, however, that the total time of suspension may not exceed 30 days un\u00ad less termination proceedings are initiated in accordance with \u00a7 1050.115-8, or un\u00ad less the responsible CSA official and the grantee agree to a continuation of the suspension for an additional period of time. If termination proceedings are ini\u00ad tiated, the suspension shall remain m full force and effect until such proceed\u00ad ings have been fully concluded. (d) Summary suspension. (1) As stated in (a) (3) of this section the responsible CSA official may invoke summary sus\u00ad pension procedures only if he deter- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 42, NO. 64\u2014 MONDAY, APRIL 4, 19 77 RULES AND REGULATIONS 18049 mines that an emergency situation exists because there is a serious risk of: (i) Substantial injury to or loss of project funds or property, or (ii) violation of a Federal, State or local criminal statute, or (iii) violation of section 603(b) or 613 of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended or of CSA Instructions im\u00ad plementing these sections of the Act. He must also determine that such risk is sufficiently serious to outweigh the gen\u00ad eral policy in favor of advance notice and opportunity to show cause. (2) Notice of summary suspension shall be given to the grantee by letter or by telegram, shall become effective upon delivery to the grantee, and shall specifi\u00ad cally advise the grantee of the effective date of the suspension and the extent, terms, and condition of any partial sus\u00ad pension. The notice shall also forbid the grantee to make any new expenditures or incur any new obligations in connec\u00ad tion with the suspended portion of the program. Expenditures to fulfill legally enforceable commitments made prior to the notice of suspension, in good faith and in accordance with the grantee's ap\u00ad proved work program, and not in antici\u00ad pation of suspension or termination, shall not be considered new expendi\u00ad tures. However, funds shall not be recog\u00ad nized as committed by a grantee solely because the grantee obligated them by contract or otherwise to a delegate agency. (3) In the notice of summary suspen\u00ad sion the responsible CSA official shall advise the grantee that it may reguest CSA to provide it with an opportunity to show cause why the summary suspen\u00ad sion should be rescinded. If the grantee requests such an opportunity, the re\u00ad sponsible CSA official shall immediately inform the grantee in writing of the specific grounds for the suspension and shall within 7 days after receiving such request from the grantee hold an infor\u00ad mal meeting at which the grantee may show cause why the sumjnary suspension should be rescinded. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the respon\u00ad sible CSA official may proceed to initiate termination proceedings at any time even though the grant has been suspended in whole or in part. In the event that ter\u00ad mination proceedings are initiated, the responsible CSA official shall neverthe\u00ad less afford the grantee, if it so requests, an opportunity to show cause why sus\u00ad pension should be rescinded pending the outcome of the termination proceedings. (4) Notices of summary suspension shall also be furnished by the responsi\u00ad ble CSA official and by the grantee to delegate agencies in the same manner as notices of intent to suspend as set forth in paragraph (c) (5), (6), and (7) of this section. Delegate agencies shall have the same right to submit written material to the responsible CSA official or to partic\u00ad ipate in the informal meetings as in the case of intended suspension proceedings set forth in paragraph (c) (5) and (6) \u00b0f this section.(5) The effective period of a summary suspension may not exceed 10 days un\u00ad less termination proceedings are initiated in accordance with \u00a7 1050.115-8 or unless the parties agree to a continuation of summary suspension for an additional period of time, or unless the grantee in accordance with paragraph (d) (3) of this section requests an opportunity to show cause why the summary suspension should be rescinded. (6) If the grantee requests an oppor\u00ad tunity to show cause why a summary suspension action should be rescinded the suspension shall continue in effect until the grantee has been afforded such opportunity and a- decision has been made. Such a decision will be made with\u00ad in 5 days after the conclusion of the in\u00ad formal meeting referred in in paragraph (d) (3) of this section. If the responsible CSA official concludes after considering all material submitted to him, that the grantee has failed to show cause why the suspension should be rescinded, the responsible CSA official may continue the suspension in effect for an additional 10 days : Provided, however, That if termi\u00ad nation proceedings are initiated, the summary suspension shall remain in full force and effect until all termination proceedings have been fully concluded. (e) Right to counsel; travel expenses. In all proceedings under this section whether formal or informal, the grantee and CSA shall have. the right to be rep\u00ad resented by counsel or other authorized representatives. If the grantee and any delegate agencies which have a right to participate in an informal meeting pursuant to paragraph (d) and (e) of this section do not have an attorney act\u00ad ing in that capacity as a regular mem\u00ad ber of the staff of the organization, the Boards of Directors of such grantees and delegate agencies will be authorized to designate an attorney to represent their organizations at any termination hear\u00ad ing and transfer sufficient funds from their current operating grants to pay the fees, travel, and per diem expenses of such attorney. The fees for such at\u00ad torney shall be the reasonable and cus\u00ad tomary fees for an attorney. However, such fees shall not exceed $100 per day without the express written approval of CSA. Travel and per diem expenses may* be paid to such attorney from grant funds only in accordance with the poli\u00ad cies set forth in the Standard Govern\u00ad ment Travel Regulations and 45 CPR 1069.3-1, 1069.3-6 (CSA Instruction 6910-la). The Board of Directors of the grantee or any delegate agency which has a right to participate in an informal meeting pursuant to paragraph (d) and (e) of this section will also be. authorized to designate two persons in addition to an attorney whose travel and per diem expenses to attend the meeting or hear\u00ad ing may be paid from the organization's current operating grant. Such travel and per diem expenses shall conform to the policies set forth in the Standard Gov\u00ad ernment Travel Regulations and governing termi\u00ad nation of assistance. (a) Purpose and scope. (1) This sec\u00ad tion establishes rules for the termina\u00ad tion of assistance provided under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended (hereinafter the Act), if the assistance is administered by the Com\u00ad munity Services Administration; a grantee may be terminated for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of its grant, including applicable Laws, regulations, CSA Instructions, grant conditions, or approved work programs. (2) However, this section shall not ap\u00ad ply to any administrative action of the Community Services Administration based upon any violation or alleged Vio\u00ad lation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; in case of such violation or al\u00ad leged violation the provisions of 45 CPR Part 1010 (CSA Instruction 6004-01a) shall apply. (3) Pursuant to section 604(3) of the Act and CSA Instruction 6800-13, the re\u00ad sponsible CSA official may terminate a grant under the circumstances outlined in paragraph (a) (1) of this section. (b) Definitions. (1) The term \"re\u00ad sponsible CSA official\" means the Direc\u00ad tor, Deputy Director, and any other of\u00ad ficial who is authorized to make the grant in question. (2) The term \"party\" means CSA, the grantee concerned, and any other agency or organization which, by right or by permission of the presiding officer, is a participant in a termination hearing. (c) Notice and pre-hearing proce\u00ad dures. (1) If the responsible CSA official believes a grantee's violation of the terms and conditions of its grant is suf\u00ad ficiently serious to warrant termination, .whether or not the grant has been sus\u00ad pended, he shall state that there appear to be grounds which warrant termina\u00ad tion and shall set forth the specific rea\u00ad sons therefor. If the reasons result in whole or substantial part from the ac\u00ad tivities of a delegate agency, the notice shall identify that delegate agency. The notice shall also advise the grantee that the matter has been set down for hearing at a stated time and place, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
