Below is a sampling of the different chiropractic services we offer in our office. - Chiropractic Care - Physiotherapy - Acupuncture - Spinal Decompression - Lifestyle Advice - Homeopathic Medicine - Blood Testing Chiropractic Care Why has chiropractic become so popular? It is because doctors of chiropractic are the only professionals trained to locate and correct the vertebral subluxation complex. A subluxation, which are misalignments of the spine or pelvis, can \"pinch\" or irritate your spinal cord, nerve roots, and/or spinal nerves. The subluxation causes body malfunction which can lead to lowered resistance to disease, pain, imbalance, and fatigue and can pave the way for ill health. It is sometimes called the \"silent killer\" because it can slowly eat away at your health and vitality for years without you having the slightest awareness of it. Through manipulation or a chiropractic adjustment, our doctors can correct subluxations. Chiropractic Physiological Therapeutics Chiropractic Physiological Therapeutics is a compliment to our chiropractic practice. After being evaluated by one of our doctors, a treatment plan is recommended, which may include ultrasound, electrical stimulation, heat, ice, decompression therapy, and/or home instruction for exercise and stretching. We also provide bracing and home rehab devices for certain conditions. Acupuncture Acupuncture has been practiced for over 3,500 years. There are many different approaches involved in the practice of acupuncture. Medical acupuncture is performed by a doctor who is trained and licensed in Western medicine who also has thorough training in acupuncture as a specialty practice. Medical acupuncture can influence three areas of health care; promotion of health and well-being, prevention of illness, and treatment of various medical conditions. Acupuncture is associated with pain control but in the hands of a well trained doctor it has much broader applications. It can also be effective as the only treatment used, or as the support to other medical treatment. The World Health Organization recognizes the use of acupuncture in the treatment of a wide range of medical problems, including digestive disorders, respiratory disorders, neurological disorders, muscle disorders, urinary, menstrual, and reproductuve problems. Spinal Decompression Spinal Decompression is a non-surgical procedure to help reduce cervical and low back pain, herniated or bulging disc, disc degeneration, facet syndrome, and sciatica. Decompression is the process of unloading the spine to help reduce the effects of gravity and everyday \"wear and tear.\" Patients are treated fully clothed and are fit with a pelvic harness as well as a thoracic harness while they lay on their backs on a computerized table. The table is set to the specific degree and weight which is determined according to the patients physical evaluation and goes through a 15 minute process of decompression therapy. A Patients treatment plan may vary but it is recommended 3 times a week for 5 weeks and then reassessed according to patient improvement. Lifestyle Advice At Tankersley Chiropractic we prefer a holistic approach that extends beyond the office visit, to include ways that you can help improve the overall health of your body. Living a healthy lifestyle is not about denying yourself food or fun, but understanding how the choices you make will impact your health. Your body needs three key ingredients; hydration, lubrication, and mobilization. Your body needs a minimum of 64 ounces of water a day to stay hydrated, pharmaceutical grade fish oil to lubricate your joints and muscles, and chiropractic mobility to maintain its function. We have a variety of pharmaceutical grade vitamins and fish oil to help you along your journey to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Nutritional Counseling & EDS Testing We provide computer guided recommendations based on forms you fill out as well as Electro Dermal Screening (EDS). The \"Listen System\" is utilized for more specific testing for homeopathic medicine as well as nutritional recommendations. The EDS testing system utilizes the acupuncture points which are both diagnostic and therapeutic to get your Bioelectrical Impedance Measurment (BMI) which is the electrical conductivity between specific points on the body creating a \"circuit\" and then measuring the flow of electricity between those points. BMI is used in our clinic to obtain health information which will allow us to create homeopathic or nutritional protocols that are specific to your own individual needs. This procedure is not covered by insurance and takes an hour and a half to complete. Due to the amount of time needed for the Nutritional Counseling & EDS Testing it is by appointment only. Homeopathic Medicine Homeopathy is a system of medicine that looks at the body as a whole; physical, emotional, and mental. Homeopathic Medicines are used to treat a wide variety of both acute and chronic conditions. Conventional medical treatment sees health as the absence of symptoms but to a Homeopath, health is much more than that. A homeopath recognizes a person's limitations and attempts to restore that person to health and freedom through the use of property selected remedies and homeopathic medicines. Homeopathic Medicines attempt to work with the body not against the body such as is done today in traditional medicine, i.e. ANTIbiotics, ANTIinflammatories, ANTIdepressants, ANTIacids, and the list goes on. Like cures like is the premise on which homeopathic medicine is practiced. Blood Testing At Tankersley Chiropractic Clinic we provide a variety of boutique blood tests; Vitamin D testing, fatty acid ratio testing, hormone testing and heavy metal testing. The purpose is to evaluate the quality of one's health as we make nutritional or homeopathic recommendations to better balance your body, not merely relieve your symptoms.
