Manju Sam's barrister says the mother was \"badly let down\" by a paediatrician who failed to refer to the baby's nutrition problem or advise of potential complications if she did not see a skin specialist. Sam, 36, and her homeopath husband, Thomas Sam, 42, have pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter of their nine-month-old daughter Gloria Thomas. In May 2002 in Sydney, the baby died from an infection her body could not fight because all her nutrition had gone into coping with her severe eczema. The parents, from Earlwood, are accused of failing to ensure Gloria got proper medical treatment for her eczema, instead relying on homeopathic remedies. The NSW Supreme Court jury has been given a folder of photographs of Gloria - earlier ones show a healthy baby and later ones which depict a raised red rash over most of her body. Manju Sam's barrister Tom Molomby SC told the jurors it was \"an ugly and upsetting condition\", and acknowledged it was hard to have a \"dispassionate, objective\" mind when seeing the photos. \"Of course, Mrs Sam got it wrong. Of course, she misjudged the situation,\" he said. And if she had taken Gloria to hospital much earlier, the child would have lived, he said. \"There is no doubt about it, but that does not make her guilty of manslaughter by criminal negligence.\" Mr Molomby said the jurors had to consider what a \"reasonable mother\" would have done in Ms Sam's position, adding Ms Sam herself had eczema as a child. She was a first-time mother with no experience of children and in her home country of India, homeopaths were on an equal footing with conventional doctors. Carolyn Davenport SC, for Thomas Sam, said that while her client was a homeopath, he did not personally treat his daughter. \"He was receiving advice and information from homeopathic doctors and treating her in accordance with their instructions and giving her medicine recommended by other doctors,\" she told the jury. \"Hindsight is a great thing. We can all have 20/20 vision with hindsight.\" In considering what a \"reasonable parent\" would have done, she said the jurors had to take note of his personal attributes, background, culture and training. Ms Davenport said the photographs of Gloria with family members showed she was \"well cared for and appears to be loved\". Early childhood nurse Melissa Harnett told the jury she saw the parents and Gloria when the child was six-and-a-half months old. She noted the baby, who was moving constantly and appeared to be uncomfortable, had severe eczema all over her body. She had also lost weight, despite being on an \"entirely appropriate diet\" consisting of breast milk and solids. \"I advised the parents they should see a skin specialist as soon as possible,\" she said. The trial continues before Justice Peter Johnson. "}
