As a child, her family moved frequently, including spending several years in Cardiff, Wales. Caroline studied English and American Literature at Kent University in Canterbury, England and, following graduation, moved to Spain where she lived and worked for a year. Linguistics has always been a fascination for Caroline who became fluent in Spanish during her time there. In the early 80s Caroline worked for a Computer Lease & Rental company in London when the company transferred her and a colleague to establish a branch in New York City. During the next decade, Caroline married, moved several times, and had 5 children within 10 years, finally settling in Northern Virginia. Caroline has had several careers throughout her life, including founding a non-profit in 1989 called Mother's Access to Careers at Home \"MATCH\". She said, \"Trying to balance my career and family was insane. I became a fanatic about mothers having flexible schedules,\" noting that the technology existed, even then, for women to work remotely. Caroline became an active advocate, writer, and spokesperson for remote work, co-authoring a book in 1999 (Moneymaking Moms: How Work at Home Can Work for You) and leveraged the media to promote her message, including appearances on network and local TV and in various print articles. Caroline was diagnosed with scalp psoriasis in the early 2000s, following an intense period of duress. After several years of struggling (and failing to improve) with topical treatments, she was fortunate to find a dermatologist who prescribed biologics; an experience she describes as \"life changing.\" In August of 2018, she returned to the United Kingdom to care for her ailing mother. She also had to confront the challenges of getting the care and medications she needed through the UK's National Health Service (NHS). In 2020, Caroline moved back to the United States and relocated to Portland, Oregon to be close to her son, Jake. Fortunately, she is now back on biologics and doing much better! Caroline has been volunteering with NPF for a year. Initially, she worked with the Research and Medical Team on an outreach project verifying the contact information of providers and clinics. In September 2021, she started as an admin volunteer in the Patient Navigation Center in Portland. In a short time, Caroline has become an integral part of the team, sending out literature and samples as well as Our Spot Welcome kits to constituents. Jane Slayden, Director of Patient Services at NPF, said, \"It is a joy to have Caroline come in each week to help Patient Services. She is always cheerful and has a devilish sense of humor.\" When Caroline is not busy working or volunteering, she enjoys exploring Portland. Her daughter lives in Seattle so trips to Washington are frequent. She also enjoys crossword puzzles, reading and experimenting in the kitchen. "}
