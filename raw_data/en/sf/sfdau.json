Full Text of the Announcement](#_Part_2._Full) [Section I. Funding Opportunity Description](#_Section_I._Funding) [Section II. Award Information](#_Section_II._Award_1) Eligibility Information](#_Section_III._Eligibility) [Section and Submission Information](#_Section_IV._Application_1) [Section V. Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency Contacts](#_Section_VII._Agency) [Section VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) The development of a vaccine capable of inducing protective titers of functional antibodies against HIV-1 remains a high priority. However, development of such a vaccine has been hindered by the poor immunogenicity of the conserved exposed regions on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. All of the known broadly neutralizing antibodies demonstrate high levels of somatic mutations and often display other unusual traits, such as a long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 and autoreactivity that can be limited by host tolerance controls. Therefore, several problems must be addressed in order to optimize B cell responses in vaccination for successful prophylactic HIV-1 vaccines. Currently available vaccines have largely been developed empirically, with little understanding of how they activate the immune system. Their early protective efficacy is primarily conferred by the induction of antigen-specific antibodies. However, there is more to antibody-mediated protection than the peak of vaccine-induced antibody titers. The quality of such antibody responses is likely to be a major factor in determining efficacy. An understanding of the division of labor among B cell subsets, their role in regulatory and effector functions, and differential participation in protective responses, may inform vaccine design. Effective and safe approaches to specifically stimulate or inhibit B cell subsets could better optimize vaccine responses. Whether or not B cells that recirculate in the peripheral blood are representative of the tissue populations and a full reflection of the immune repertoire available to the host is another related question. Much remains to be learned about how to best target specific B cell populations in vaccine responses. Additionally, long-term protection requires the persistence of vaccine-induced antibodies and/or the generation of immune memory cells capable of rapid and effective reactivation upon subsequent microbial exposure. B cell responses can be negatively influenced by regulatory T cells (Tregs) and HIV-1 envelope immunogens may exert immune suppressive effects on B cell help and affinity matured memory B cells. The important role of B cells in the efficacy of current vaccines should not over-shadow but rather emphasize innate immune and T cell responses that shape the humoral response. Recent findings suggest that more attention should be given to the nature of the helper cells in understanding how B cell memory and antibody responses arise. These include the incorporation of new categories of innate cell-driven T dependent (TD) and T independent (TI) antibody responses and of different classes of T helper cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that innate-type cells influence practically every stage of B cell differentiation. Further, the availability of T cell help is the limiting factor for all B cell fate decisions that involve extensive affinity maturation and immune memory. The ultimate goal to develop a preventive vaccine may depend on fostering new discoveries that will fill in the current gaps in understanding how to overcome the immunological roadblocks in generating protective humoral responses to HIV-1. Novel approaches designed to harness unexploited molecular pathways for the induction and regulation of B cell responses involved in the generation of persistent HIV-1 specific antibodies may be critical to interrupt HIV transmission and/or substantially control disease progression. The objectives of the BCHIP for HIV-1 Vaccine Design are to support: (1) innovative studies that identify new immunization strategies to induce protective persistent antibody; and (2) studies that increase fundamental knowledge of the immunological mechanisms involved in the induction and regulation of B cell immune responses leading to protective HIV-1 antibody responses, both systemically and in the mucosa. Due to the complexity of generating protective humoral responses to HIV-1, applications that leverage multidisciplinary collaborations in synergistic basic discovery research in immunology, virology and host genetics are encouraged. These collaborations may comprise the translation of existing critical knowledge and technologies from other fields for the benefit of HIV-1 vaccine design. Translation of the proposed hypothesis into immunogen design and/or immunization strategies for evaluation in animal models is encouraged.

As part of the [NIH mission](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Investigator(s) Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators, or in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Innovation Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Approach Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Environment Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. Protections for Human Subjects For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). Vertebrate Animals The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following five points: 1) proposed use of the animals, and species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers to be used; 2) justifications for the use of animals and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers proposed; 3) adequacy of veterinary care; 4) procedures for limiting discomfort, distress, pain and injury to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound research including the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs and/or comfortable restraining devices; and 5) methods of euthanasia and reason for selection if not consistent with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Biohazards Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. Resubmissions For Resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project. Renewals Not Applicable Revisions Not Applicable As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score. Applications from Foreign Organizations Reviewers will assess whether the project presents special opportunities for furthering research programs through the use of unusual talent, resources, populations, or environmental conditions that exist in other countries and either are not readily available in the United States or augment existing U.S. resources. Select Agent Research Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Resource Sharing Plans Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: 1) [Data Sharing Plan](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); 2) [Sharing Model Organisms](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and 3) [Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153).
