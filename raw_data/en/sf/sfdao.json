Kent1* Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne,1CSIRO Livestock Industries, Geelong,4John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra,3and National Centre for HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, University of New South Wales, Sydney,5Australia, and Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina2 Received 31 March 2004/Accepted 4 August 2004 Further advances are required in understanding protection from AIDS by T-cell immunity. We analyzed a set of multigenic simian/human immunodeciency virus (SHIV) DNA and macaques. The number of vaccinationsrequired, the effect of DNA vaccination alone, and the effect of cytokine (gamma interferon) coexpression by thefowlpox virus boost was also studied. A coordinated induction of high levels of broadly reactive CD4 and CD8T-cell immune responses was induced by sequential DNA and fowlpox virus vaccination. The immunogenicityof regimens utilizing fowlpox virus coexpressing gamma interferon, a single DNA priming vaccination, or DNAvaccines alone was inferior. Signicant control of a virulent SHIV challenge was observed despite a loss ofSHIV-specic proliferating T cells. The outcome of challenge with virulent SHIV mn229 correlated with vaccine immunogenicity except that DNA vaccination alone primed for protection almost as effectively as the DNA/ fowlpox virus regimen despite negligible immunogenicity by standard assays. These studies suggest thatpriming of immunity with DNA and fowlpox virus vaccines could delay AIDS in humans. In the absence of technologies to reliably induce broadly neutralizing antibodies, protection against human immunode-ciency virus (HIV) relies on the clearance of already infectedcells by T-cell immunity (27). Heterologous priming and boost-ing HIV vaccine strategies involving priming by DNA vaccina-tion and boosting with recombinant attenuated pox virus vec-tors (such as fowlpox virus) encoding common HIV or simianimmunodeciency virus (SIV) antigens reliably induce highlevels of T-cell immune T-cell responses correlatewith partial protection from virulent SHIV infection (9). Theoptimal use of these vaccines to protect humans from HIV-1remains to be dened. There are outstanding scientic and practical issues with this vaccination approach. Although large peak CD8 T-cell re-sponses are likely to be helpful, other qualities of T-cell im-munity, such as the breadth, durability, presence, and timing ofCD4 T helper responses and recall immune response to infec-tion may be equally important (19). Unadjuvanted DNA vac-cination of outbred primates is often poorly immunogenic asmeasured by current technologies, despite clearly priming for arapid expansion of T-cell immunity following recombinant poxvirus boosting (4, 22). Interestingly, pox virus vaccination alonehas, despite inducing lower levels of immune responses, beenreported to provide nearly similar immunity to DNA/pox viruspriming/boosting regimens in a rhesus/SHIV model (5).High rates of viral mutation during early replication strongly select for T-cell escape mutants and long-term protection fromlentiviral disease may be difcult to achieve with current, pri-marily T-cell-based vaccines (8, 37). A potential problem as-sociated with nonsterilizing protection from lentiviral disease isthe dysfunction and infection of virus-specic CD4 T-cell re-sponses associated with HIV-1 infection (6, 7, 15). Only certainsubgroups of HIV-1-infected subjects, long-term nonprogres-sors and those treated with antiretroviral therapy early in in-fection, have preserved CD4 T-cell immune responses toHIV-1 (16, 32). If CD4 T-cell dysfunction follows the bluntedburst of replication occurring in infected subjects with priorT-cell immunity, this could abolish long-term protection fromdisease. Rhesus macaques selected for MamuA*01 major allele expression control 89.6P infection following priming/boosting and other vac - cination strategies (4, 9, 34). Protection is much poorer wheneither SIV mac239 is used as the challenge virus or MamuA*01 - negative macaques are studied (38). We previously reported a virulent mucosal HIV-1IIIB-based SHIVmn229 infection model of outbred pigtail macaques (14). A codon-optimized SIVgag DNA vaccine (previously to assist protection of MamuA*01-positive rhesus macaques from SHIV89.6P disease) (9) and virus-like-particle vaccines demonstrated poor protec- tive immunity against a (14). The SHIVmn229 /pigtail macaque model could provide a rigorous alternative model to study protective im- munity of DNA and pox virus vaccines. A disadvantage of priming/boosting vaccination strategies in the eld is the requirement for multiple different vaccinations.Whether one DNA vaccination, in the absence of readily de-* Corresponding author.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Monkeys. Juvenile Macaca nemestrina monkeys were free from HIV-1, SIV, and simian retrovirus infection, housed under physical containment level 3 con-ditions, and anaesthetized with ketamine (10 mg/kg intramuscularly) prior toprocedures. All experiments were performed according to National Institutes ofHealth guidelines on the care and use of laboratory animals and were approvedby the University of Melbourne and CSIRO Livestock Industries Animal Exper-imentation and Ethics committees. DNA vaccinations. The DNA vaccine strain, pHIS-SHIV-B, encoded full- length unmutated SIV mac239 Gag and Pol, HIV-1AD8, Tat, Rev, and Vpu, and the 5/H11032third of HIV-1AD8 Env. Genes were inserted into vector pHIS-64 (Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Wellesley, Mass.) behind the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. Plasmid vector pHIS-64 has kanamycin resistance,the bovine growth hormone poly(A) termination signal, and 64 CpG motifs inaddition to those naturally present that are primate optimized. Empty vectorplasmid DNA, pHIS, served as a control vaccine. Plasmid pHIS-SHIV-B forimmunization was prepared by Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), at 1 mg/ml at weeks 0 and 4 (Ta-ble 1). Recombinant fowlpox virus vaccines. Construction of the fowlpox virus vac- cines has been described (11). Briefly, FPVgag/pol, expressing SIV Gag and Pol,was constructed by inserting gag/polPCR into PCR primers for thefowlpox virus early/late promoter and an early transcription terminator wereused for insertion into fowlpox virus vector FPV-M3. HIV-1 93TH254 env(mutated to remove the middle third) was similarly amplied with fowlpox virus promoter and terminator sequences and inserted into the plasmid vector pCH34 for con-struction of a recombinant fowlpox virus with HIV Env expressed from the REVinsertion site. Human IFN- /H9253was inserted into FPV-SIVgag/pol under the con- trol of the fowlpox virus early/late promoter immediately downstream of thefowlpox virus thymidine construct vaccine FPV-SIVgag/pol-IFN-/H9253, coexpressing human IFN- /H9253. Recombinants were selected on the basis of coexpression of the Escherichia coli gpt gene and plaque puried on the basis of coexpression of the E. coli /H9252-galactosidase gene. Fowlpox virus vaccines were prepared in saline, and 5 /H1100310 7PFU was injected intramuscularly at week (Table 1). IFN-/H9253Elispot assay. Enumeration of antigen-specic IFN- /H9253-secreting cells was assessed with a monkey IFN- /H9253Elispot commercial kit (U-CyTech, Utrecht, The Netherlands) as previously described (14). Briefly, freshly isolated periph-eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with aldrithiol-2-inacti-vated whole SIV mneor control microvesicles (5 /H9262g/ml, kindly provided by Jeff Lifson, AIDS Vaccine Program, National Cancer Institute) or SIVmac239 Gag and Pol overlapping 15-mer peptide pools (1 /H9262g/ml/peptide, supplied by the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program)for 18 h. Cells were washed twice, transferred to anti-IFN- /H9253monoclonal anti-body-coated flat-bottomed 96-well plates containing antigen, and incubated for a further 5 h. Cells were lysed, and plates were washed prior to incubation withbiotinylated anti-IFN- rabbit antibody, G antibody. IFN- /H9253spots were devel- oped and analyzed by an automated reader (AID, Strassberg, Germany). Resultswere normalized to antigen-specic IFN- by flow cytom - etry as previously described (14, 25). Briefly, 200 /H9262l of whole blood was incubated with 1 /H9262g/ml of 15-mer peptide pools costimulatory antibodies CD28 and CD49d(BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.) for 7 h. Brefeldin A (10 /H9262g/ml; Sigma) was included during the las t5ho ft chloro-phyll added to each well and incubated for 30 min.Red blood cells were lysed (fluorescence-activated cell sorting lysing solution;BD) and washed with phosphate-buffered and the werepermeabilized (fluorescence-activated cell sorting /H9253-allophy- cocyanin antibody (BD) prior to xing with formaldehyde and acquisition (FAC-Scan; BD). Acquisition data were analyzed with responses were standard [3H]thymidine incorporation assay to 1 /H9262g of SIV Gag peptide pool per ml, 10 /H9262g of inactivated SIV per ml, or control antigens as (22) and also phenotyped by 5-(and 6)carboxyfluorescein diacetate,succinimidylester (CFSE) proliferation fluorescent dyeCFSE (5 /H9262M; Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) prior to culturing for 6 days with the SIVgag peptide pool or inactivated SIV as above. analysis. Proliferating CD4 or CD8 Tcells were expressed as the percentage of CD3 /H11001CD4/H11001or CD3/H11001CD8/H11001cells emitting CFSE of a lower intensity CFSE intensity of the nondividing T-lymphocyte subset. SHIV challenge inoculated atraumatically with tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50)/ml in 0.5-ml doses over 2 days (total, 105 TCID50/ml) as previously described (14). SHIV viremia was quantied by reverse transcriptase real-time PCR, and depletion of peripheral CD4 T cells was quan- tied by flow cytometry as described (14). To further dene the monkey infectious dose of the SHIVmn229 challenge stock used (described in reference 14), the stock was further diluted and used for intrarectal inoculation of M. nemestrina monkeys at doses of 2 /H11003102and 2/H11003103 TCID50. The two macaques used for each dilution of the stock became infected, as evidenced by high viral load (mean peak SHIV plasma RNA for the four animals, 7.9 log10copies/ml; range, 7.6 to 8.7) and low peripheral CD4 T cells by week 5 after inoculation (mean, 0.7% CD4 lymphocytes; range, 0.3 to 1.2%). The administered dose of 105TCID50therefore represented a monkey infectious dose of /H11350500 TCID50. reporter gene assay for neutralizing antibodies. Neutral- ization was measured as a function of reductions in luciferase reporter geneexpression after a single round of virus infection in TZM-bl cells as described(26). TZM-bl cells were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDSResearch and Reference Reagent Program, as contributed by John Kappes andXiaoyun Wu. These cells are engineered to express CD4 and CCR5 (28) andcontain integrated reporter genes for refly luciferase and E. coli /H9252-galactosidase under control of an HIV-1 long terminal repeat (39). Briefly, cell-free SHIV mn229 (200 TCID50, amplied on human PBMC) with serial dilutions of test samples in triplicate in a total volume of 150 /H9262lf o r1ha t 37\u00b0C in 96-well flat-bottomed culture plates. Freshly trypsinized cells (10,000 cells in 100 /H9262lo f growth medium containing 75 /H9262g of DEAE dextran per ml and 2.5 /H9262M indinavir) were added to each well. One set of control wells received cells and virus (viruscontrol), and another set received cells only (background control). After a 48-hincubation, 100 /H9262l of cells was transferred to 96-well black solid plates (Costar) for measurements of luminescence with Bright Glo substrate solution as de-scribed by the supplier (Promega). Neutralization titers are the dilution at whichrelative luminescence units were reduced by 50% compared to virus control wellsafter subtraction of background relative luminescence units.TABLE 1.

J. V IROL .Power and statistical considerations. The primary endpoints, set prior to starting the study, were differences in outcome of SHIV challenge (peak and setpoint SHIV viremia and set point peripheral CD4 T-cell levels) between groups.Based on previous studies with this challenge stock (14), six macaques per grouppowered the study (80%, 2 /H9251/H11005 0.05) to detect 0.5 log 10differences in both peak (week 2) and set point (mean, of weeks 5 to 11) plasma SHIV RNA and 5% set point CD4 T lymphocytes between groups. Comparison of viral load at set pointutilized a time-weighted area-under-the-curve analysis. Week 11 was chosen asthe end of the set point time period based on previous studies (14), as allmacaques were likely to be alive and contributing data points up to that time, butat least some control macaques were likely to be euthanized shortly thereafter.Statistical comparisons of secondary endpoints of immunogenicity between vac-cine groups utilized a ttest of pairwise comparisons without compensation for the multiple analyses performed. RESULTS T-cell immunogenicity. The kinetics, magnitude, and pheno- type of the cellular response induced by vaccination was quan-tied by antigen-specic T-cell expression /H9253staining (Fig. The 2DNA/FPV vaccine regimen was the most immunogenic, in-ducing a mean peak response to SIV Gag peptides of 797spot-forming cells/10 6PBMC (range, 455 to 1345) 1 week after the fowlpox virus booster was administered (Fig. 1A). Simi- larly, the at1,005 spot-forming cells/10 6PBMC (range, 595 to 1400) at week 9, demonstrating vigorous recognition of processed viral particles (Fig. 1B). Despite the small number of IFN- /H9253-secret- ing T cells after DNA vaccination (mean response to Gagpeptides at week 8, 75 spot-forming cells/10 6PBMC; range, 25 to 215), a rapid rise within 1 week of the fowlpox virus booster indicated that the DNA vaccine induced effective priming ofthe cellular response. All other vaccine groups also exhibitedsignicantly elevated SIV Gag responses relative to controls 1week after the nal vaccination ( P/H110210.05). Modication of the 2DNA/FPV vaccination regimen in- numbers of antigen-specic cells. Coexpression ofIFN-/H9253from the fowlpox virus construct had the undesired effect of reducing the peak number of IFN- /H9253-secreting T cells in response to inactivated SIV and by 51% ( P/H110050.13), respectively. Similarly, administra- tion of a single DNA vaccination prior to the fowlpox virusbooster reduced the response to inactivated SIV 54% ( P/H110050.11), respectively. Three vaccinations alone induced much lower levels of IFN- /H9253-expressing cells (122 and 192 cells/10 6PBMC to Gag peptides and whole SIV, respec - tively; both, P/H110210.01 compared to 2DNA/FPV). Responses to the polymerase region of SIV were substan- tially lower than observed for the other antigens (Fig. 1C),presumably reflecting the lower level of polymerase expressionfrom the vaccines. The only vaccine group to exhibit a poly-merase response above background levels was the 2DNA/FPVregimen for a period of 3 weeks after the booster ( P/H110210.05 at week 9). The Gag response in 2DNA/FPV vaccine recipients was further characterized at peak response for the breadth of theresponse (Fig. 1D). Stimulation with pools of 10 SIV Gagpeptides showed that the response across the Gag region wasbroad in most animals with responses of /H1102250 spots/10 6PBMCgenerated to an average of four pools (range, two to seven pools).

Peak numbers ofGag-specic CD4 T cells occurred 1 week after the fowlpoxvirus booster. CD4 T-cell responses were highest in the 2DNA/FPV-vaccinated group (1.0% of CD3 /H11001CD4/H11001lymphocytes; range, 0.2 to 2.1%) and reduced in other vaccine groups. The frequency of Gag-specic CD8 T cells was higher than Gag-specic CD4 T cells, peaking at 2.4% (range, 0.3 to 4.7%)of all CD8 T 2DNA/FPV-vaccinated Gag-specic CD8 T-cell response in later than the peak CD4 T-cell response. Allother comparator vaccine regimens generated substantiallylower of SIV-specic CD4 and CD8 T cells, lymphoprolifera-tive responses were analyzed with both the [ 3H]thymidine in - corporation assay and a CFSE proliferation assay. 6-dayculture of isolated from a macaque im-munized with the 2DNA/FPV vaccine regimen 2 weeks afterfowlpox virus boosting had a large proportion of CD4 T cellsproliferating in response to both SIV Gag peptides and inac-tivated SIV stimulation (Fig. 3). Although responses werelower, CD8 T cells also proliferated to the SIV antigens. When analyzed across the different vaccine regimens, pro- liferative SIV Gag-specic CD4 T cells early boosting were greatest in macaques immunized with the2DNA/FPV regimen, with lower responses in the 1DNA/FPVand 2DNA/FPV-IFN- /H9253regimens and negligible Gag-specic proliferative responses in the 3DNA regimen (Fig. 3), similarto the pattern of T-cell immune observed by IFN- /H9253 Elispot and intracellular IFN- /H9253staining. A similar pattern responses to both SIV Gag peptides and inacti-vated SIV was observed by the [ 3H]thymidine incorporation, with the exception that the responses in the 2DNA/FPV-IFN- /H9253 immunized group were equivalent to those of the 2DNA/FPVgroup. SHIV challenge. The pathogenic SHIV mn229 challenge stock was inoculated intrarectally (105TCID50or/H11350500 monkey in - fectious doses) into all 30 macaques 10 weeks after the lastvaccination. CD4 T cells and plasma SHIV RNA were fol-lowed for 33 weeks, unless macaques were euthanized to avoidAIDS-related illnesses (Fig. 4). The six control macaques re-ceiving DNA and fowlpox virus vaccines not expressing SHIVantigens had high peak levels of SHIV RNA (mean, 8.2 log 10 copies/ml; Table 2) following inoculation and at set point(weeks 5 to 11; mean, 6.2 log 10copies/ml; Fig. 4B). All six control macaques lost peripheral CD4 T cells precipitously, declining to a mean of 0.43% of total lymphocytes 3 weeksafter challenge, and ve of the six macaques were euthanizedwithin 15 weeks of inoculation with incipient AIDS. All 24 vaccinated macaques became infected except one in the 1DNA/FPV group (animal 4237). Peak SHIV viral load inthe infected macaques at 2 weeks following inoculation waslowest in the groups vaccinated with the 2DNA/FPV and3DNA regimens (means, 6.7 log 10copies/ml), being signi - cantly lower than controls (Fig. 4A, Table 2). The peak viralload in the 2DNA/FPV-IFN- /H9253regimen (mean, 7.3 log 10copies/ ml; Table 2) was also lower than controls, and the peak viral load in the 1DNA/FPV regimen, excluding the outlier animal4237 that did not become infected, was not signicantly differ-ent from controls (mean, 7.4 log 10copies/ml). There were no signicant differences in viral load between the vaccinated groups. Set point viral load was dened prior to challenge as the mean viral load over weeks 5 to 11 following challenge, whenviral load is relatively stable and all animals appear healthy. Setpoint SHIV viral load was lowest in the groups vaccinated withthe 2DNA/FPV and 3DNA regimens (4.9 and 4.8 log 10copies/ ml, respectively), being signicantly lower than controls and the 1DNA/FPV regimen (6.2 and 6.0 log10copies/ml, respec - tively; Fig. 4A, Table 2). The set point viral load in the 2DNA/FPV-IFN- /H9253regimen (5.6 log 10copies/ml) was not signicantly different from that of controls. FIG. 2.

The animals were followed for 33 weeks following SHIV challenge (Fig. 4B to F). Five animals in the 2DNA/FPV-IFN-/H9253group, four in the 1DNA/FPV group, two in the 3DNA group, and none in the 2DNA/FPV group were euthanizedwith incipient AIDS within 18 weeks after SHIV challenge.Only 2 of the 29 infected macaques controlled viremia to belowdetectable levels (one in each of the 3DNA and 2DNA/FPV-IFN-/H9253groups), with all the remaining macaques experiencing ongoing viremia. Peripheral CD4 T cells were retained ( /H1102210% of lymphocytes) at the end of the study in four of the 2DNA/FPV-immunized animals, three of the 3DNA-immunized ani-mals, and only one each of the 1DNA/FPV- and 2DNA/FPV-IFN-/H9253-immunized animals. The partial protection in the group receiving the 3DNA vaccines in the absence of signicant T-cell immunity as agroup was interesting, and we therefore attempted to correlatethe outcome of challenge with prechallenge T-cell immuneresponses across all animals in all groups. There was a weak but signicant correlation between peak CD8 T-cell responsesto SIV Gag as measured by point viral r/H110050.47, P/H110050.01). However, reductions in peak viral load did not correlate with any T-cell immunity as measured by Elispot did not correlate with outcome of challenge (notshown). The three animals in the 3DNA immunization group,which effectively controlled the SHIV mn229 challenge, did not have high levels of T-cell immunity (Fig. 5, grey squares). Immune responses following challenge. T-cell immunity was analyzed following SHIV challenge by intracellular IFN- /H9253 staining and proliferation 6). SIV Gag-specicCD8 T cells expressing IFN- /H9253were dramatically boosted after challenge (Fig. 6A). Mean Gag-specic CD8 T cells peaked 3weeks following challenge at 11.7% (range, 3.0 to 34.7%) of outbred pigtail macaques postchallenge CD8 T-cell responses, with peak responsesat week 2 challenge numbering 3.8% (range, 0.1% to9.5%) the 3DNA the Lymphoproliferative postimmunization.

In the2DNA/FPV group, a gradual rise in the proportion of SHIV- specic CD4 T cells expressing IFN- /H9253occurred, reaching a mean of 1.9% (range, 0.2% to 3.8%) by 15 weeks after chal-lenge. Data were not available for macaques in other groups attime points when there were too few macaques (less than threeout of six) with sufcient peripheral CD4 T cells ( /H110221%) to estimate the mean number of SHIV-specic CD4 T cells. De-spite these limitations, proportion of CD4 T cellswas expressing IFN- /H9253in response to Gag stimulation in the 3DNA group, the 1DNA/FPV group, and (at 1 week afterchallenge) the 2DNA/FPV-IFN- /H9253group. In contrast to the large CD4 CD8 T cells expressing IFN- /H9253in response to SHIV challenge, there was a nearly complete lack of SHIV-specic proliferatingT cells (Fig. 6C). Proliferating T cells were readily detected upto 5 weeks after the last vaccination in the 2DNA/FPV, 1DNA/FPV, and 2DNA/FPV-IFN- /H9253groups, but no signicant rise in SHIV-specic proliferating T cells was observed out to 15weeks after challenge. This lack of anamnestic proliferationresponse to virus challenge was observed with both inactivatedSIV as a stimulating antigen (Fig. 6C) and SIV Gag peptides(not shown). Since the partial control of SHIV 89.6P viremia in previous DNA and pox virus vaccine studies has been associated with a rapid rise in neutralizing antibodies (4), we assessed neutral-izing antibody responses to SHIV mn229 following challenge. There were no neutralizing antibodies to SHIVmn229 at the time of challenge (consistent with the divergent and mutated envgenes in the vaccines) and no signicant neutralizing an- tibody responses developed prior to week 11 postchallenge(Fig. 6D). At week 11 (when all animals were still alive), higherneutralizing antibody responses were detected in the 2DNA/FPV group compared to controls or the other vaccine groups. DISCUSSION This study demonstrated high levels of CD4 and CD8 vaccines. Partial protective a very high dose, virulent SHIV mn229 mucosal chal - lenge. Comparator primingvaccination or coexpressed IFN- /H9253with the fowlpox virus boost were less immunogenic and less protective. A vaccine regimenthat utilized only the DNA vaccine demonstrated reasonableprotective efcacy despite being far less immunogenic than theDNA/fowlpox virus regimens. The protection observed in the DNA vaccination alone group is intriguing. Little or no SHIV-specic CD4 or CD8T-cell response was induced by DNA vaccination alone byIFN-/H9253Elispot, intracellular cytokine staining, or proliferation studies. Although there was a weak but signicant inversecorrelation across all animals between set point viral load andSIV Gag-specic CD8 /H11001T cells, this correlation was primarily driven by high levels of immunity in animals receiving the 2DNA/FPV vaccines. Levels of T-cell immunity were low inanimals receiving 3DNA immunizations that controlled theSHIV mn229 challenge. Following challenge, a sharp rise in CD8 and CD4 T-cell responses was observed in the 3DNA vaccina- tion group, parallel to but lower than those observed in the2DNA/FPV group. Mean viral load and CD4 counts were FIG. 4. Outcome of SHIVmn229 challenge.

Theseresults suggest that the \"priming\" effect of the DNA vaccinealone may be sufcient to recall effective immune responsesfollowing challenge. The priming of immunity by the DNAvaccine may have been assisted by the multiple immunostimu-latory CpG motifs added to the vector and expression of alarge proportion of SHIV antigens. These results raise ques-tions about whether the expansion (and contraction) of T cellsfollowing the boosting poxvirus vaccination is either requiredor useful for long-term protective immunity (10). Technologiesto more readily measure and characterize this priming immuneresponse following DNA vaccination could facilitate a betterunderstanding of protective T-cell immunity. The poorer SHIV-specic immunity in the DNA/fowlpox virus group coexpressing IFN- /H9253conrmed data in macaques with similar HIV-1 vaccines (Dale et al., submitted for publi-cation). Not only were T-cell responses signicantly lower inanimals vaccinated with fowlpox virus coexpressing IFN- /H9253, but a nearly complete loss of protective efcacy was observed. Wehypothesize that the expression of IFN- /H9253may downregulate fowlpox virus vector expression of the inserted SHIV genes.This is supported by ndings in a previous study where alteredanti-fowlpox virus antibody responses were observed afterboosting with cytokine coexpressing fowlpox virus vaccines(Dale et al., submitted). Several phenotypic features of the T-cell responses induced by these DNA and fowlpox virus vaccines were of interest.Serial weekly measurements of SHIV-specic CD4 and CD8T-cell responses by IFN- /H9253staining demonstrated coordinated early induction of CD4 responses of lower mag-nitude 1 week following the boost and then later induction ofCD8 responses of higher magnitude 2 weeks following theboost. Multiple regions of SIV Gag were recognized by theT-cell responses induced as detected by both IFN- /H9253Elispot (Fig. 1D) and intracellular IFN- /H9253staining assays (not Additional analyses of the T-cell responses induced by thesevaccines are ongoing, including epitope mapping, analyzingmemory markers, dening additional cytokines secreted byspecic and examining the in vivo cytotoxic potential ofthe immunity induced. The vaccinations did not induce signicant envelope-specic T-cell responses (not shown) likely because of the truncatedand heterologous Env proteins expressed by these DNA andfowlpox virus vaccines. SIV Gag-specic antibody responses were induced by the vaccines, but no signicant antibody re-sponse to envelope was detected prechallenge (unpublisheddata; Dale et al., submitted) and no signicant neutralizingantibody responses were detected at the time of challenge.Improving expression of whole Env antigens may also facilitateat least narrowly directed neutralizing antibody responses. Re-sponses to polymerase were lower than to Gag, consistent withlower expression of polymerase by the vaccines (Purcell et al.,unpublished data). Improvement in expression of polymeraseproteins could potentially improve the breadth of immuneresponses induced by these vaccines. Several aspects differentiated this study from previous DNA prime/poxvirus boost macaque studies (2, 4, 17, 18, 22, 23, 29,31, 33). First, we studied outbred, unselected pigtail macaquesthat were highly susceptible a pathogenic, high-dose, intrarectal SHIV mn229 challenge and demonstrated partial protection. In to SHIV89.6P challenge of vaccinated MamuA*01 -positive rhesus macaques (4, 9, 34), few (3 out of 24) vaccinated pigtail macaques chal- FIG. 5.

The slow gene - ration of neutralizing antibody to SHIVmn229 is consistent with the long (30 to 70 weeks) initial in vivo passage of SHIVHXB2 through two pigtail macaques, the heterologous nature of the neutralization determinants in the vaccines, and the previouslydescribed resistance to neutralizing antibody of pathogenicSHIVs derived from SHIV HXB2 (1, 12, 13, 21, 35, 36, 41). The late generation of neutralizing antibody (11 weeks postchal- lenge) did not completely control SHIVmn229 viremia in these animals, potentially due to evolution of neutralizing antibody escape variants over time, as described in humans with HIV-1infection (30, 40). Ongoing viral replication observed followingthe acute infection is also highly likely to select for T-cellescape variants and eventual loss of viral control in this model,as observed in SIV mac239 responses were detected in animals partialcontrol of viremia. Interestingly, few or no SHIV-specic Tcells could be detected by proliferation studies, suggesting thatSHIV-specic CD4 T cells were dysfunctional. In vitro SHIVinfection in the culture could have killed proliferating T cells,although additional experiments with antiretroviral drug treat-ment in vitro did not rescue T-cell proliferative capacity (notshown). A proliferative defect in HIV-1-specic T cells iscommon in humans chronically infected with HIV-1, andHIV-1-specic CD4 T cells appear to be preferential targetsfor infection and elimination by HIV-1 (15). The long-termeffectiveness of HIV-1 vaccines that induce nonsterilizing im-munity could be limited by infection-induced dysfunction ofHIV-specic T cells (10). These studies have been used to guide subtype B-based HIV-1 DNA and fowlpox virus clinical vaccine studies in Aus-tralia that use the 2DNA/FPV vaccine regimen. The SHIV DNA vaccine component studied herein expressed six SHIV genes,while the fowlpox virus SHIV vaccines expressed only three,and one of these (Env) was derived from a different HIV-1strain. Recent studies suggest including additional shared SHIVgenes, in particular that for the envelope, can facilitate theinduction of broadly reactive T-cell immunity (3, 24). In orderto evaluate whether improved DNA/FPV vaccine combina-tions can generate broader immunity, our group has now con-structed single recombinant FPV for both HIV-1 (based onHIV-1 subtype A/E) and SHIV that express nearly identicallarge amounts of antigenic material. Plans are under way in2004 to evaluate an HIV-1 A/E DNA/fowlpox virus combina-tion in clinical trials in Thailand.
