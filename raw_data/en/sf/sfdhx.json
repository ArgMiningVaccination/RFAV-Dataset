I found that there isn't much evidence ACV can cure colds, heal acne, help you lose weight, or alleviate heartburn\u2014and that vinegar can sometimes be harmful. Then came the angry emails and Facebook posts. Readers chided me for interviewing researchers and doctors rather than people who have actually been helped by apple cider vinegar. Others felt evidence is irrelevant; vinegar works for them, so they'll keep using it. A few implied that my writing was unbalanced and unfair. After contemplating these comments, I've decided to explain why I research health claims the way I do\u2014and to make a case for the value of [Truth Serum](https://www.self.com/topic/truth-serum), a column that will evaluate medical ideas and trends using scientific evidence. With a bachelor's degree in molecular biology and a master's in science reporting, I know how to hunt down and interpret relevant studies and identify the best researchers to talk to. It can be hard to make sense of health information because of the ways we perceive and interpret our experiences, the power of our expectations, and the blind spots we have concerning risk. Science, I believe, is a crucial tool to cut through the noise. Let's start with an example. A few days ago, a pickup truck almost rear-ended me right after I bought a pint of blueberries. I'd be crazy to think that my blueberry purchase had anything to do with the near-collision, because there's no reason why blueberries should cause car crashes. The two events occurred in close succession, but it was easy for me to recognize they were unrelated. On the other hand, the last time I drank too much vodka and felt like death the next day, I was pretty sure that the two were causally related\u2014the vodka triggered my malaise. That's because decades of research have elucidated [how our bodies react to one too many Sea Breezes](http://www.self.com/story/this-is-exactly-what-drinking-too-much-does-to-your-body), and they do not react well. These examples illustrate just how important evidence and plausibility are when assessing how two events relate to each other if at all. If I drink a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar [in the hopes of curing my cold](http://www.self.com/story/cold-remedies-that-actually-work), and then my sniffles improve, I might assume ACV healed me. But why? For many purported remedies, there are no credible reasons to causally link the two together; there's not a single study showing that vinegar affects the common cold. These kinds of logical fallacies are so old and pervasive they even have a Latin name: post hoc ergo propter hoc, which translates to \"after this, therefore because of this.\" Our weaknesses in the health arena could have something to do with the fact that medicine is insanely complicated\u2014it's difficult for us to discern whether two things going on in the body are related or not. And of course there's the fact that tons of people believe and tout that home and natural remedies like vinegar cure comment ailments like colds. Google \"apple cider vinegar colds\" and you'll see dozens of [articles like this](http://www.organicauthority.com/how-to-use-apple-cider-vinegar-to-prevent-and-treat-colds-and-the-flu/) chronicling people's transformative experiences. Yet there are so many reasons to raise eyebrows at health claims based on anecdotes rather than scientific evidence. For one thing, there's what I call real-world publication bias. Let's say you wonder whether lemon juice cures hay fever, and you do an internet search. You'll see tons of stories from people who swear it works. But what about the people whose hay fever didn't ease after a lemon juice cocktail? They probably aren't broadcasting their experiences, because they aren't fueled by the excitement of experiencing a cure. Some may even continue to believe the remedy works and just assume they did it incorrectly. I've seen this on Facebook: \"I drank grape juice to stave off stomach flu and I still got sick, but maybe that's just because it wasn't organic.\" Even when the unlucky ones do report that their remedies didn't work, their stories aren't going to be that popular; they might not even show up on Google, because guess what? People are a lot more interested what can cure things than what can't. Another thing that makes remedies seem more effective than they really are: the fact that many health problems\u2014colds, scrapes, bug bites, heartburn, headaches, cold sores, cramps\u2014resolve on their own over time. When you try a treatment and feel better, you might attribute the resolution to your remedy, even if you were going to improve anyway. Same goes for preventive tonics: If I take Echinacea to [stave off a cold](http://www.self.com/story/7-proven-ways-to-avoid-getting-sick-this-winter) and then I don't get sick, I'll be convinced the Echinacea worked\u2014but maybe I wasn't destined to catch that cold anyway. Trying more than one treatment at a time, which we often do, muddies things further. Did Vicks Vaporub really cure your toenail fungus, or could it have been the vinegar soak, or perhaps the tea tree oil you were using, too? Last but not least, let me tell you about the absolutely fascinating placebo effect. A placebo is a sugar pill or other \"fake\" medicine or treatment that should not, on its own, affect a person's symptoms. But as an anesthesiologist [discovered](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27499483) during WWII, when he noticed that merely telling wounded soldiers they were getting morphine made them feel better, placebos can be powerful healers. Put another way: When we expect that a remedy will make us better, sometimes the expectation itself does the job. In 2016, researchers [identified brain networks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082893/) involved in the placebo response, discovering that people whose symptoms improve in response to placebos\u2014who feel better based on the mere expectation of relief\u2014have more connections between certain brain regions than do people with muted placebo responses. The study essentially shows that there is a biological basis for the placebo response; it is real, and it also [seems to be getting more powerful](https://www.wired.com/2009/08/ff-placebo-effect/). There's nothing bad about experiencing the placebo response\u2014 [if eating ginger eases your headache](http://www.self.com/story/ginger-has-many-health-benefits-plus-recipes), and you don't know whether the ginger or your expectations are to thank, who cares? Your headache is gone, so you'll be taking ginger next time, too. But the existence of the placebo response does make it difficult to discern what's actually easing your pain. Studies are designed to bore through this clutter and illuminate how things really affect us. The best-designed studies are known as [double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11377113) (RCTs for short), and they work like this. Let's say you want to know whether green tea improves depression. If you just give people green tea and then ask them if it's helping, a lot of your subjects will probably say yes, but you won't know whether the tea itself is helping, their depression eased on its own, or the placebo response is responsible. An RCT, on the other hand, would go something like this. First, you'd recruit people who suffer from depression and then randomly break them into two groups. (You want these groups to be virtually identical, because you don't want any differences that arise between them to be due to anything other than the remedy you're going to give them.) Then you'd give people in one group green tea\u2014say, every day for six months\u2014and give the other group a tea that tastes like green tea but isn't. (What's important is that both groups believe they are getting the \"real\" treatment so that they have similar placebo responses.) Next, you'd track the groups over time to see if depression symptoms improved more in those getting the green tea\u2014and ideally you, the researcher evaluating the subjects, would also not know who got which treatment, because this knowledge could color your expectations and affect your analyses. (If you hope the green tea works, you might judge that the green tea drinkers are doing better than they really are.) Because both groups will experience the placebo effect, and depression has an equal chance of spontaneously resolving in people in both groups, too, any improvements you see in the green tea group that are above and beyond improvements seen in the other group should actually be due to the green tea. And there you have your answer. There are, of course, other types of health studies, too\u2014and although most are not as effective at shining a light on causal relationships as RCTs, they are still far more useful than collections of stories on the internet and success stories from friends. Science isn't perfect, by any means\u2014even the quality of gold-standard RCTs can be mired by certain design flaws\u2014 but it gets us closer to the truth than anything else. If green tea really does seem to help your [depression](http://www.self.com/topic/depression), though, who cares what the science says? I still suck on zinc lozenges when I feel I'm coming down with a cold, even though I know the [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23775705) that they work is pretty equivocal. Plus, absence of evidence doesn't mean evidence of absence; some remedies may actually work even if there aren't any good studies on them. But here's the thing: Every single medical intervention\u2014whether it's surgery, Echinacea, aspirin, or lemon juice\u2014poses risks. And evidence, which many popular health claims lack, is the best way to identify them. Big Pharma only cares about its bottom line, many say, and the U.S. government is too steeped in bureaucracy and corruption to protect us. I get the skepticism, but I don't think the solution should be to reject conventional medicine and turn to so-called \"natural\" and herbal remedies, as many people are doing because they think they're safer. The irony is that herbal remedies and supplements [don't have to be safety tested](https://ods.od.nih.gov/Health_Information/ODS_Frequently_Asked_Questions.aspx#Information), while traditional medicines sold over the counter and by prescription do. Natural and herbal ingredients can also be just as potent as, if not more potent than, synthetic drugs, so the idea that they are intrinsically gentler is a fallacy. [These products aren't under much, if any, oversight](http://www.self.com/story/the-scary-facts-about-natural-supplements-like-green-tea-extract-powder-caffeine-powder-and-kava/), either\u2014nobody makes sure that manufacturers are actually putting what they claim to be into their products. In April 2017, for instance, a popular brand of [homeopathic baby teething tablets were pulled from the market](http://www.self.com/story/homeopathic-teething-products-fda-reports) after being tied to the deaths of ten children. The deadly pills contained much more of a dangerous active ingredient than they said they did, and for a long time, presumably, nobody noticed. In 2015, the New York State Attorney General's office [tested a variety of herbal supplements](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-asks-major-retailers-halt-sales-certain-herbal-supplements-dna-tests) being sold at GNC, Target, Walgreens and Walmart and found that many didn't contain the herbs they advertised; instead, they were chock full of fillers like powdered rice, asparagus and ground houseplants, which could cause dangerous allergic reactions. Supplement companies aren't required to show that their products actually do anything medically useful before they are put out on store shelves, either. The bottom line is this: The world is full of breathless health claims, and it can be tough to distinguish those that are true from those that aren't. If you've found a remedy you love, that's great, as long as you've researched the potential downsides and are OK with them. This column is pro-science, but that doesn't mean it's pro-industry, pro-drugs or anti-alternative medicine. Some [alternative remedies](http://www.self.com/story/i-love-getting-acupuncture-but-is-it-really-doing-anything) are evidence-based, while some conventional drugs are not as effective as we've been led to think. I look to science for answers because it gives us the clearest path to truth and well-being in a forest of garbled, misleading, and potentially dangerous ideas. I hope you'll join me on my journey to uncover what to trust and believe. Melinda Wenner Moyer is a science and health writer based in New York.
