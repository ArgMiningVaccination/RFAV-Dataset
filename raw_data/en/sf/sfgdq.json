A small research team, doctors, and support staff assist his research work. The team has given proper training to conduct the work according to established standards. Some of the projects are conducted in collaboration with other reputed institutes. i. Preparation of HIV nosode (May-2010) A new HIV nosode sourced from HIV positive (type I and II negative for other co-infections) was scientifically prepared. The ethics committee, which is constituted and functions as per ICMR guidelines, approved the project. The source material, fifteen-step preparation process, and the standardization concerning viral count, protein profile, pH, and the process of potentization were documented. The HIV nosode in 30c and 50c potencies was prepared. Safety and efficacy were established through clinical trials and homeopathic pathogenetic trials (Drug proving). ii. Homeopathic HIV nosode, 30c potency was conducted using accepted guidelines, ethical approval, and scientific documentation; with the aim to introduce a new nosode in the homeopathic pharmacopeia. Usable symptoms derived from the study. iii. HIV nosode clinical trial (May-2010) An open-label exploratory clinical trial in thirty HIV-positive individuals was conducted using the HIV nosode in 30c and 50c potencies. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of HIV nosode in HIV-infected participants in terms of reduction in viral load and improvement of immunological parameters such as CD4 and CD8 count and CD4 percentage and general health parameters. iv. Preparation of HCV nosode (May-2010) HCV nosode from sera of HCV type I and III positive (negative for other co-infections) consented donors were prepared by serial dilution and potentization method described in Homeopathic Pharmacopeia. The source material and the preparation process were standardized. The HCV nosode in 30c and 50c potencies was prepared. Safety and efficacy were established through clinical trials and homeopathic pathogenetic trials (Drug proving). v. HCV nosode clinical trial (May-2010) An open-label exploratory clinical trial in twenty-six HCV-positive individuals was conducted using the HCV nosode in 30c and 50c potencies. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of HCV nosode by observing the reduction in viral load from baseline and general health parameters. vi. Homeopathic Pathogenetic 30c potency was conducted using accepted guidelines, ethical approval, and scientific documentation; with the aim to introduce a new nosode in the homeopathic pharmacopeia. Usable symptoms derived from the study. vii. Homeopathic drug proving) of CP-010 was conducted using the accepted guidelines, ethical approval, and scientific documentation. viii. CP-010 clinical trial for pain management (Nov-2011) A double-blind, randomized, comparative study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CP- 010 with Magnesium phosphoricum was conducted. 116 patients having sub-acute and chronic painful conditions were randomized in the study. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of potentized preparation CP-30c potency by measuring the reduction in the intensity of pain using a numeric rating scale (NRS). ix. Homeopathic Pathogenetic drug proving) of Hydroquinone was conducted, using the accepted guidelines, ethical approval, and scientific documentation; with the aim of introducing a new medicine in the homeopathic pharmacopeia. x. Preclinical study (animal- Wistar rats) to evaluate the efficacy of CP 010 in arthritis (Oct- 2012) The anti-arthritic activity of CP 010, magnesium phosphoricum was studied in 60 Albino Wistar rats in 6 different groups using positive and negative control to observe the effect of homeopathy medicines on an animal model. The study proved that homeopathic medicines are as effective as anti-inflammatory Diclofenac on certain days. xi. Preparation, Standardization and in vitro safety testing and standardized using different Mycobacterium strains. Bacterial characteristics, strain, and quantity used, and the process of preparation was documented so that the nosodes could be re-visited and re-developed with scientific validation and standardization. In vivo studies and sterility testing of the nosode. xii. A method for preparation of Nosode developed: The old method of nosode preparation required revamping in light of the latest development in the areas of microbiology. A scientific, standardized 15-step method was developed for making reproducible nosodes now and in the future. xiii. Animal study to see the immune-modulator effect of nosode. (Ongoing) xiv.
