Scientific Family - Phytolaccaceae (pokeweed) Botany P. alliaceae is a perennial herb or shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Caribbean islands. The plant grows 5 cm to 1.5 m in height.( [Duarte 2005](#16242265), [Luz 2016](#26944236), [Raintree 2013](#Raintree.2013)) The roots are fusiform, the stem is straight and rigid, and the branches are slender with longitudinal stripes. The simple leaves have an alternating phyllotaxy of elliptic and acuminate shape and an acute apex and base with a slightly wavy margin 7 to 12 cm in length and 3 to 6 cm in width.( [Duarte 2005](#16242265)) P. alliaceae flowers are white, sessile, and bisexual with spikes or inflorescences. The cylindrical, achene-type fruits have longitudinal stripes and similar seed dimensions. The roots and leaves have a strong, garlic-like odor that taints the milk and meat of animals that graze on it.( [Luz 2016](#26944236)) History Anamu has a long history of use in herbal medicine. In Brazil, the plant has been used in religious ceremonies for centuries. In Brazilian herbal medicine, P. alliaceae is considered an antispasmodic, diuretic, menstrual promoter, stimulant, and sweat promoter. Herbalists and natural health practitioners in Brazil use anamu to treat edema, arthritis, malaria, rheumatism, and poor memory, and as a topical analgesic and anti-inflammatory for skin conditions. Throughout Central America, anamu has been used to relieve birthing pains and facilitate easy childbirth, as well as to induce abortion. In Guatemalan herbal medicine, the plant is called apacin; a leaf decoction is taken internally for digestive conditions, flatulence, and fever and also used externally as an analgesic for muscular pain and skin diseases. Anamu is commonly used in South and Central America as a natural remedy to treat colds, cough, influenza, respiratory and pulmonary infections, and cancer, and to support the immune system. In Cuba, herbalists decoct the whole plant and use it to treat cancer and diabetes, and as an anti-inflammatory and abortifacient.( [Luz 2016](#26944236), [Raintree 2013](#Raintree.2013)) lipids, flavonoids, and triterpenes. Sulphur compounds known as unique to this species.( [Luz 2016](#26944236)) Dibenzyl trisulphide, originally thought to be a synthetic compound, was revealed to be a natural product when isolated as a viscous and pungent-smelling oil stem and leaves of the plant.( [De Sousa 1990](#DeSousa.1990)) The triterpenes isoarborinol and isoarborinol acetate have been isolated from the leaves, and babinervic acid and 3-epiilexgenin A have been isolated from the aerial parts of the plant.( [Luz 2016](#26944236)) The root Ethnobotanical studies show that various parts of the plant have been used therapeutically its activity on the CNS, P. alliaceae has been used as an anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, anaesthetic, and sedative.( [Luz 2016](#26944236)) Analgesic activity Animal data In a study evaluating the antinociceptive effects of P. alliaceae plant extracts in mice, intraperitoneal administration of all tested fractions of P. alliaceae at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg attenuated neurogenic pain induced by chemical with (10 mL/kg).( [Gomes 2005](#15635161)) Myricitrin, a flavonoid have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antinociceptive properties.( [Luz 2016](#26944236)) In analgesia experiments, 3 groups of rats (n=7 per group) were orally administered P. alliaceae extract (31.4 mg/kg body weight), acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/kg body weight), or agar 1% (control group). Rats were evaluated for ability to support pressure applied to the posterior paw using a Ugo Basile analgesiometer. The analgesia coefficient was calculated for 60, 120, and 180 minutes after treatment. Compared with the prototype drug acetylsalicylic acid, the analgesic effect of the P. alliaceae extract was less potent but more sustained.( [Lopes-Martins 2002](#12046866)) Clinical data The analgesic effects of P. alliaceae have been evaluated; in a study of patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis, the analgesic effects of tipi tea were not significant compared with a placebo tea.( [Ferraz 1991](#1842010)) Antiamoebic activity In vitro data A subfraction of P. alliaceae (isoarborinol) was shown to have dose-dependent antiamoebic activity against Entamoeba histolytica, with a 0.3 mg/mL 85.2% growth inhibition without toxic effects.( [Zavala-Ocampo 2017](#28621111)) Anticancer activity Animal and in vitro data In a critical review, dibenzyl trisulphide, a mitogen-activated protein extracellular regulated kinase 1 and 2 signal transduction molecule, exhibited antiproliferative activity on a wide variety of cell lines. Cytotoxic activity of dibenzyl trisulphide was increased when bound to albumin.( [Williams 2007](#17621839)) Cytotoxicity has been shown to be variable for P. alliaceae, depending on the type of extract and the cell line. For example, erythroleukemia, melanoma, and breast adenocarcinoma 4T1 cell lines exhibited IC50 values ranging from 29 to 36 mcg/mL to a hydroalcoholic P. alliaceae extract, while hepatic adenocarcinoma no to a methanolic extract.( [Navarro 2017](#29048336)) Ex vivo patient data Primary de novo cells from 26 patients with leukemia (acute myeloid leukemia [AML] and acute lymphoid leukemia [ALL]) were sensitive to treatment with anamu (P. alliaceae) extract; patients were classified as good responders, bad responders, or nonresponders to the cytotoxic activity of the extract. Leukemic cells from some patients with ALL or AML responded better to anamu extract than to methotrexate or idarubicin, respectively. When the extract was combined with chemotherapy, cell response was variable. For the 6 patients in relapse, all were sensitive to ex vivo treatment with anamu extract, and all but 1 response was lost when the extract was combined with chemotherapy.( [Ballesteros-Ramirez 2020](#33488744)) Anticonvulsant activity Animal data The anticonvulsant activity of P. alliaceae was evaluated in male Swiss mice administered an aqueous crude extract of P. alliaceae roots (500 mg/kg, 1,000 mg/kg, and 2,000 mg/kg orally), followed 30 minutes by (75 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or maximal transcorneal electroshock (rectangular 50 mA) to induce convulsive behavior. Animals pretreated with the high extract doses (1,000 mg/kg and 2,000 mg/kg) showed an increase in convulsive thresholds and decreased induration of convulsions compared with the control group.( [de Lima 1991](#1841991)) Anti-inflammatory effects Animal data In a study evaluating the anti-inflammatory effects of P. alliaceae plant extracts in rats with pleurisy, oral administration of a root extract did not reduce the total number of leukocytes at the doses tested. However, the highest dose of extract tested (43.9 mg/kg body weight) reduced numbers of migrating neutrophils, mononuclear cells, and eosinophils; the dose of 31.4 body weight also reduced mononuclear cell migration.( [Lopes-Martins 2002](#12046866)) A semipurified ethanol extract of P. alliaceae reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in mice, with inducible nitric oxide synthase and nuclear factor-kappa beta both being lowered in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of the extract on nitric oxide inhibition was higher than that of the positive control (indomethacin). Reductions were also observed for prostaglandin E2, leukotriene C4, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), beta.( [Gutierrez 2017](#28808377)) Antioxidant effects In a study evaluating various activities of common plants used in Costa Rica for traditional medicinal purposes, P. alliaceae had weak antioxidant effects compared with other plants studied.( [Navarro 2017](#29048336)) Anxiogenic/Anxiolytic activity Animal data A study evaluated the anxiolytic activity of a lyophilized hydroalcoholic extract of P. alliaceae (aerial parts) in male Wistar rats with acute, stress-induced gastric lesions. After administration of P. alliaceae extracts (200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, and 600 mg/kg orally), rats were evaluated using the elevated plus maze test. P. alliaceae extract at a dose of 600 mg/kg increased the percentage of open arm entries on the apparatus. However, it did not alter the percentage of time spent in the open arms or the number of entries to the enclosed arms of the elevated plus maze. Overall, these data indicate that P. alliaceae extract exerts a selective anxiolytic effect, with no effects observed on the spontaneous locomotor activity of the animals.( [Audi 2001](#Audi.2001)) In another study, short-term administration of an aqueous crude extract of P. alliaceae roots (500 mg/kg, 1,000 mg/kg, and 2,000 mg/kg orally) reduced the spontaneous locomotor activity of male Swiss mice on an open field test.( [de Lima 1991](#1841991)) Asthma Animal data A methanol leaf extract of P. alliaceae significantly reduced total inflammatory cells and eosinophils in a mouse asthma model. Increases in IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta observed in controls were reversed with the extract, and the magnitude of anti-inflammatory effects and mucus secretion were similar between P. alliaceae extract and the positive control dexamethasone. Additionally, the antioxidant effects of the extract were similar to the positive control alpha-tocopherol. These results were supported by lung histology.( [Rosa 2018](#30341485)) CNS effects Animal data In a study evaluating the antidepressant effect of P. alliaceae extract in female Swiss mice, single doses of P. alliaceae extracts (100 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg orally and intraperitoneally) produced depressant-like effects, as indicated by the increased time of immobility when the mice were subjected to a forced swimming test.( [Gomes 2008](#18778763)) Dosing Clinical data are lacking to provide P. alliaceae dosing recommendations. Pregnancy / Lactation Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy of P. alliaceae in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Methanol extracts of anamu can cause uterine contractions, which can lead to miscarriage.( [Raintree 2013](#Raintree.2013)) Interactions No studies have evaluated herb-herb interactions or herb-drug interactions with P. alliaceae. Adverse Reactions Potential adverse reactions of P. alliaceae are unknown; no adverse reactions have been reported. Toxicology In animal models of acute toxicity, mice exposed to high levels of a crude aqueous extract of P. alliaceae root (single doses of 800 to 8,000 mg/kg) showed reduced locomotor activity. Mice treated with 8,000 mg/kg doses developed ataxia that was not fatal. In albino rats, a single 4,000 mg/kg dose of the dry crude extract of P. alliaceae leaves was not fatal or toxic after 14 days but produced alterations in leucocyte count, eosinophil differentials, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin values, and hematocrit, as well as signs of hepatic overload.( [Fontoura 2005](#Fontoura.2005)) References Disclaimer This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
