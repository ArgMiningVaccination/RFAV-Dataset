This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy in COVID-19. Methods: A systematic literature search using appropriate medical subject heading (MeSH) terms was performed through Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, SCOPUS, OVID and Cochrane Library electronic databases. The main outcomes considered were mortality and safety of IVIG versus placebo/standard of care. This review was carried out in accordance with Cochrane methodology including the risk bias assessment and grading of the quality of evidence. Measures of treatment effect were mean differences (MD) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcome measures and risk ratio (RR) or MD for binary outcomes. Two reviewers independently extracted data from individual studies, and disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. Results: A total of 2401 COVID-19 patients from 10 studies (four randomized controlled trials (RCT) and six non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs)) were included in the analysis. Participants received IVIG or placebo/standard of care. The use of IVIG was not associated with a significantly reduced risk of death (RR 0.50, 95% CIs 0.18-1.36, p = 0.17 for RCTs; RR 0.95, 95% CIs 0.61-1.58, p = 0.94 for non-RCTs; low certainty of evidence). IVIG significantly reduced the length of hospital stay (MD 2.24, 95% CIs 3.20/1.27; p = 0.00001; low certainty of evidence), although this difference was significant only for studies evaluating moderate COVID-19 patients. No significant difference was observed in the incidence of overall and serious adverse events between IVIG recipients and controls (very low certainty of evidence). Conclusions: The current evidence from the literature does not support the use of IVIG in COVID-19 patients.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-01-09", "cleaned_text": "Efficacy of High-Dose Polyclonal Intravenous Immunoglobulin in COVID-19: A [1](#B1-vaccines-10-00094), [2](#B2-vaccines-10-00094)]. At the time of writing, more than 4 million people have died from coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and more than 200 million have been infected [ [3](#B3-vaccines-10-00094)]. Clinicians and researchers have struggled to develop an effective therapeutic protocol to treat and contain the spread of this infectious disease, and more than 300 drugs have been or are being investigated under clinical trials in different parts of the world [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-00094), [5](#B5-vaccines-10-00094)]. Among the various therapeutic and prophylactic strategies developed to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, passive immunization by COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) transfusion has been proven effective when CCP was administered early (within 72 h from symptom onset) and with a high titer ( >1:160) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAb) [ [6](#B6-vaccines-10-00094), [7](#B7-vaccines-10-00094)]. Late disease stages are characterized by an exaggerated immune response, which responds to immunosuppressants: high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), based on previous positive experiences in autoimmune, inflammatory and other infectious diseases, including coronavirus-induced infections [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-00094), [9](#B9-vaccines-10-00094)], has been also proposed for COVID-19 [ [10](#B10-vaccines-10-00094), [11](#B11-vaccines-10-00094), [12](#B12-vaccines-10-00094), [13](#B13-vaccines-10-00094)]. 2.

Study Selection and Data Extraction [Table 1](#vaccines-10-00094-t001)). Quantitative tabulation of results includes: first author name and year of publication, the type of the study, the disease severity, the population size (intervention and control groups), treatment (intervention and control groups), adverse reactions and main results. 2.7. Assessment of the Methodological Quality of Published Clinical Studies [14](#B14-vaccines-10-00094)]. They discussed any discrepancies and achieved consensus on the final assessment. [15](#B15-vaccines-10-00094), [16](#B16-vaccines-10-00094), [17](#B17-vaccines-10-00094)]. This tool includes seven specific bias domains, pre-intervention and post-intervention, and it has to be performed as an outcome-based assessment for each outcome reported for a trial. The domains are: (1) confounding; (2) selection of participants; (3) classification of intervention; (4) deviation from interventions (biases that arise when there are systematic differences between the care provided to experimental intervention and comparator groups, beyond the assigned interventions); (5) missing outcome; (6) measurement of outcomes (blinding of outcome assessors aims to prevent systematic differences in measurements between intervention groups, but it is less common in non-RCTs than in RCTs; and (7) selection of reported result overall. 2.8. Effect of Intervention [18](#B18-vaccines-10-00094)]. The I2 statistic describes the percentage of total variation across trials due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. In the case of no heterogeneity (I2 = 0), studies were pooled using a fixed-effects model. When values of I2 were >0, a random-effects analysis was undertaken. 2.9. Subgroup Analyses 2.10. 'Summary of Findings' Tables [19](#B19-vaccines-10-00094), [20](#B20-vaccines-10-00094)]. These tables present key information concerning the certainty of the evidence, the magnitude of the effects of the interventions examined and the sum of available data for the main outcomes. The 'Summary of findings' tables also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE approach, which defines the certainty of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specific interest. The certainty of a body of evidence involves consideration of within-trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates, and risk of publication bias. We have presented the following outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' table: (i) mortality; (ii) length of hospital stay and (iii) adverse events. All calculations were conducted using REVMAN 5.4. 3. Results [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-00094-f001)). Six hundred and seven articles were excluded after preliminary screening. The remaining 67 articles were deemed potentially eligible, and their full text was assessed. Fifty-five articles were then excluded because of case series or case reports, protocols or because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Two additional studies were excluded because, although they focused on IVIG use in COVID-19 patients, they were not controlled trials [ [21](#B21-vaccines-10-00094), [22](#B22-vaccines-10-00094)]. Thus, for this systematic review we considered 10 studies fulfilling our pre-specified criteria, including 2401 [26](#B26-vaccines-10-00094), [27](#B27-vaccines-10-00094), [28](#B28-vaccines-10-00094), [31](#B31-vaccines-10-00094), [32](#B32-vaccines-10-00094)]. Five studies were conducted in China, two in Iran and one each in India, the USA and Turkey. In two studies, IVIG use was restricted to non-severe COVID-19 cases [ [27](#B27-vaccines-10-00094), [29](#B29-vaccines-10-00094)], while in the other eight trials IVIGs were used in severe or critical patients. [Table 1](#vaccines-10-00094-t001)summarizes the main characteristics and results of these studies. The dosage and timing of IVIG administration was greatly variable between studies. The comparator group included standard therapy (nine studies) or placebo (one study) [ [25](#B25-vaccines-10-00094)]. |First Author, CI 0.06-0.99; p < 0.001). Early treatment (within 7 days of onset) was associated with greater benefit| significantly prolonged median survival time (68 versus 18 days, p = 0.014)| |Gharebaghi, 2020 [31](#B31-vaccines-10-00094)] 0.5 g/kg (74 patients) 2021 [ [32](#B32-vaccines-10-00094)] 3.1. Risk of Bias in Included Studies [Supplementary File S1](#app1-vaccines-10-00094)). According to the ROBINS-I tool, for the outcome mortality, four non-RCTs were judged to be at high risk of confounding bias, and two at unclear risk ( [Supplementary File S1](#app1-vaccines-10-00094)). For selection bias, three non-RCTs were judged to be at high risk, and one at unclear risk. All the non-RCTs were judged to be at unclear risk of bias for the domain bias in measurement \"classification of interventions\" due to the retrospective nature of these studies. 3.2. Effects of Interventions [Table 1](#vaccines-10-00094-t001)and the [Supplementary File S1 (Data and Analyses)](#app1-vaccines-10-00094). The most commonly reported outcomes were mortality and length of hospital stay ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-00094-f002)and [Figure 3](#vaccines-10-00094-f003)). For the other outcomes (see the [Supplementary File S1](#app1-vaccines-10-00094)), it was not possible to perform a pooled analysis because they were inconsistently reported or because, for continuous variables, values were reported as median and interquartile range. 3.3. Mortality [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-00094-f002)); in the six non RCTs, there were 219 deaths out of 764 patients in IVIG group compared to 233/866 in the control group (RR, 0.95; 95% CIs, 0.61/1.58; p = 0.94). In both cases the level of certainty was low due to imprecision and inconsistency. The subgroup analysis (see [Supplementary File S2](#app1-vaccines-10-00094)) according to the baseline conditions did not show differences in mortality rates in studies conducted in patients with moderate COVID-19 and in patients with severe/critical illness, both in RCTs (low quality of evidence) or in non-RCTs (very low quality of evidence) ( [Table 2](#vaccines-10-00094-t002)). 3.4. Length of Hospital Stay [Figure 3](#vaccines-10-00094-f003)). Low certainty of evidence was due to inconsistency and ROB. The effect was driven mostly by inclusion of patients with a moderate COVID-19 infection. Indeed, in the two studies enrolling severe patients (see [Supplementary File S2](#app1-vaccines-10-00094)), the difference in length of hospital stay favored controls compared to IVIG (MD, 2.57 days; 95% CIs, 1.33/3.80; p < 0.0001; low quality of evidence), while in studies evaluating moderate patients, the difference favored IVIG compared to controls (RR, 9.64; 95% CIs, 11.18/8.1; p < 0.00001; low quality ( [Table 2](#vaccines-10-00094-t002)). Only one non-RCT [ [27](#B27-vaccines-10-00094)] was evaluated for length of hospital stay. 3.5. Adverse Events [23](#B23-vaccines-10-00094), [29](#B29-vaccines-10-00094), [30](#B30-vaccines-10-00094)] and serious adverse events [27](#B27-vaccines-10-00094), [29](#B29-vaccines-10-00094), [30](#B30-vaccines-10-00094)] ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-10-00094-f004)). in 17/92 patients receiving IVIG and 20/156 patients receiving standard therapy (risk difference (RD) 0.03; 95% CIs, 0.12/0.06; very low quality of evidence due to imprecision and serious risk of bias). Serious adverse events were rarely reported either in IVIG recipients (4/137) or controls (42/710) (RD, 0.00; 95% CIs, 0.04/0.04; very low quality of evidence due to imprecision and serious risk of bias ( [Table 2](#vaccines-10-00094-t002)). 4. Discussion [23](#B23-vaccines-10-00094)], other studies were conducted in this setting to assess the impact of IVIG on various clinical outcomes, mainly on mortality. High-dose polyclonal IVIGs are supposed to be immunosuppressive at doses in the range of 2 g per kg of recipient body weight. Given that COVID-19 largely resembles an autoimmune disorder in the late stages, IVIGs are presumed to act as an immune modulator by dampening the excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 which drives pathology [ [33](#B33-vaccines-10-00094), [34](#B34-vaccines-10-00094)]. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Xiang and colleagues on three clinical trials and three cohort studies [ [12](#B12-vaccines-10-00094)] found that the effect of IVIG was associated with the severity of COVID-19, as it was highest in the critical subgroup. Our updated systematic review, performed on a higher number of studies and including more patients, gave different results. Although the length of hospitalization was significantly reduced in the IVIG group versus controls, a subgroup analysis showed that this effect was present only in patients with moderate disease. Regarding the main outcome \"mortality\", the use of IVIG was not associated with a significantly reduced risk of death, independently of COVID-19 severity or type of study (RCT or non-RCT). Such results are in accordance with a recently published living systematic review and network meta-analysis [ [35](#B35-vaccines-10-00094)]. [36](#B36-vaccines-10-00094), [37](#B37-vaccines-10-00094)], pre-pandemic sera have been shown to be devoid of neutralizing activity [ [38](#B38-vaccines-10-00094)], making the occurrence of neutralizing activity extremely unlikely in lots manufactured from plasma collected before 2021. However, the situation is rapidly evolving, with most plasma donors worldwide becoming seropositive because of convalescence and/or vaccination. Baxter reported seropositivity in lots released since September 2020. From there, values steadily increased, in correlation with the cumulative COVID-19 incidence, to reach a mean of 36.7 IU/mL, and 93% of lots were positive by January 2021. Extrapolating the correlation, the authors estimated that IVIGs could have reached an anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency of ~400 IU/mL (i.e., a dose similar to that contained in a CCP unit) by July 2021. Therefore, further trials evaluating the last batches of IVIG are needed to assess whether the addition of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs to their immunomodulatory effects will translate into a higher clinical efficacy.
