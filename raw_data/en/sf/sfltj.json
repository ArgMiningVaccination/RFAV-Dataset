Anderson, Ph. D. Austin Water Center for Environmental Research Biology - the study of Life - biotic Ecology - the study of Life Systems [ecosystems] - biotic and abiotic The word ecology was coined in 1866 by the German zoologist Ernst Haeckel, who applied the term oekologie to the \"relation of the animal both to its organic as well as its inorganic environment.\" \"the body of knowledge concerning the economy of nature (...) the study of all those complex interrelationships referred to by Darwin as the condition of the struggle for existence\" The word comes from the Greek oikos , meaning \"household,\" \"home,\" or \"place to live.\" Thus, ecology deals with the organism and its environment. \"Every generation...writes its own description of the natural order, which generally reveals as much about human society and its changing concerns as it does about nature.\" Worster Order and Change - Evolution \"The existence of a balance of nature has been a dominant part of Western philosophy since before Aristotle. But the science of ecology and evolutionary biology together demonstrate that there is no balance of nature \u2014 not today and not at anytime in Earth's long history. The paradigm is based on belief, not data; it has no scientific merit. Nature is constantly in flux varying in scales of space and time, and most of that flux is due entirely to natural causes. At this time of extraordinary human influence on Earth's ecosystems and biota, I argue that it is essential for humanity to understand how evolution occurs and why ecology is far more dynamic than static.\" Nothing Endures But Change Heraclitus 540-480BC Order of Nature Aristotle's History of Animals classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical \"Ladder of Life\" (scala naturae), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the scala naturae or Great Chain of Being. Arthur O. Lovejoy (1936), The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea The Economy of Nature Carl Linnaeus 1707 - 1778 Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist, who laid the foundations for the modern scheme of binomial nomenclature ( Genus species ). The first edition of Systema Naturae was printed in 1735. He then returned to Sweden, where he became professor of botany at Uppsala. In 1751 he publishes The Economy of Nature , [Transl. of Oeconomia naturae ], Linnaeus opened his The Economy of Nature , \"We understand the all -wise disposition of the Creator in relation to natural things, by which they are fitted to produce general ends and reciprocal uses.\" \"an order of nature, that some animals should be, as it were, created only to be miserably butchered by others, it seems that his Providence not only aimed at sustaining, but also keeping a just proportion amongst all the species; and so prevent any one of them increasing too much, to the detriment of men, and other animals. For if it be true, as it is most assuredly, that the surface of the earth can support only a certain number of inhabitants, they must all perish, if the same number were doubled or tripled.\" Evolution and the Economy of Nature Charles Darwin 1809- 1882 He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestry, and proposed the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection in On the Origin of the Species (1859). Darwin claims in the Origin that \"all organic beings are striving, it may be said, to seize on each place in the economy of nature .\" \"The solution, as I believe, is that the modified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become adapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature\" What was also new with Darwin is that the economy of nature began to be understood with conceptual tools borrowed from political economy. The division of labor, competition (\"struggle\" in Darwin's words), trading, cost, the accumulation of innovations, the emergence of complex order from unintentional individual actions, the scarcity of resources and the geometric growth of populations are ideas borrowed from Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, David Hume and other founders of modern economics.

Development of Ecology - Equilibrium and Biodiversity Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson, The Theory of Island Biogeography (1967) - An ecology that makes no testable predictions is not yet a science - Mathematical modeling and islands - The number of species represented on an island depends on size and location - Number of species always reaches an equilibrium point - species diversity does not continue to develop indefinitely, new colonization must be matched by extinction - community structure focus rather than ecosystem The \"new ecology\" post -Odum No inherent stability Robert May, Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems (1973) - Mathematical models demonstrate that the more species there were, the more fragile was the system -Chaos theory and complexity, \"Confronted with disturbances beyond their normal experience\" complex systems like rainforests tended to crumple. Instability of biodiversity and invasion biology Daniel Botkin , Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the Twenty- first Century (1990) The new ecology emphasizes Disequilibria Instability Chaotic fluctuations in ecosystems both \"natural\" and human impacted If 20th-century ecology was marked by an infatuation with balance, then our era is one of disturbance, disruption, non-equilibrium, chaos, and randomness. The New Ecology of Change - Ecological Resilience The general meaning of resilience, derived from its Latin roots 'to jump or leap back', is the ability to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change. The concept of resilience in ecological systems was first introduced by the Canadian ecologist C.S. Holling in order to describe the persistence of natural systems in the face of changes in ecosystem variables due to natural or anthropogenic causes. Holling argued that complex adaptive systems did not tend toward equilibria, but toward maximizing diversity over deeper evolutionary time. Holling, C.S. (1973). \"Resilience and stability of ecological systems\". Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 4: 1 -23. Resilience is... ...the ability to absorb disturbances, to be changed and then to reorganize and still have the same identity (retain the same basic structure and ways of functioning). As resilience declines the magnitude of a shock from which an ecosystem cannot recover gets smaller and smaller. Ecosystem resilience is the capacity of an ecosystem to tolerate disturbance without collapsing into a qualitatively different state that is controlled by a different set of processes. A resilient ecosystem can withstand shocks and rebuild itself when necessary. \"Resilience\" as applied to ecosystems has three defining characteristics: The amount of change the system can undergo and still retain the same controls on function and structure The degree to which the system is capable of self -organization The ability to build and increase the capacity for learning and adaptation Gaia Hypothesis and Symbiotic Nature The hypothesis, which is named after the Greek goddess Gaia, was formulated by the scientist James Lovelock and co-developed by the microbiologist Lynn Margulis in the 1970s. The Gaia hypothesis proposes that organisms interact with their inorganic surroundings on Earth to form a self-regulating, complex system that contributes to maintaining the conditions for life on the planet. \"the biota and its environment constitute a single homeostatic system that opposes changes unfavorable for life\" The scientifically accepted form of the hypothesis has been called \"influential Gaia\". It states the biota influence certain aspects of the abiotic world, e.g. temperature and atmosphere. They state the evolution of life and its environment may affect each other. An example is how the activity of photosynthetic bacteria during Precambrian times have completely modified the Earth atmosphere to turn it aerobic, and as such supporting evolution of aerobic organisms (in particular eukaryotic life). [But why did Gaia favor only the evolution of a particular branch of life?] Symbiotic Nature Symbiosis is a major driving force behind evolution. She considers Darwin's notion of evolution, driven by competition, as incomplete and claims that evolution is strongly based on cooperation, interaction, and mutual dependence among organisms. Endosymbiosis is any symbiotic relationship in which one symbiote lives within the tissues of the other, either in the intracellular space or extracellularly. Examples are rhizobia, nitrogen-fixing bacteria that live in on legume nitrogen-fixing bacteria inside reef-building corals; and endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to about 10% -15% of insects. Ectosymbiosis, also referred to as exosymbiosis , is any symbiotic relationship in which the symbiont lives on the body surface of the host, including the inner surface of the digestive tract The Microcosmos Ecosystem Cycles [Biogeochemical Cycles] Short-circuiting Cycles The Nitrogen Cycle The Carbon Cycle From Daily, Nature's Services 1997 Ecosystem Services - Socioecological Systems and Human-Nature Symbiosis Ecosystem Services Maintenance of atmosphere Protection from ultraviolet rays Regulation of climate Maintenance of genetic diversity Purification of air and water Detoxification and decomposition of wastes Generation of soil and renewal of soil fertility Pollination of vegetation Control of agricultural pests Dispersal of seeds Translocation of nutrients Ecology - the study of Life Systems [ecosystems] - biotic and abiotic The thing is, both balance and flux are undoubtedly aspects of nature. A new view of nature that combines them in a way that both scientists and the public find compelling is needed. We should bridge the present disparity between ecology as a science and ecology as a romantic idealism about nature, not only for intellectual reasons but for the sake of robust public policy. Order and Change - Evolution Balance-> Stability-> Resilience Nothing Endures But Change Heraclitus 540- 480BC Ecology is an infant just learning to talk, and, like other infants, is engrossed with its own coinage of big words. Its working days lie in the future. Ecology is destined to become the lore of Round River, a belated attempt to convert our collective wisdom of biotic materials into a collective wisdom of biotic navigation. This, in the last analysis, is conservation. "}
