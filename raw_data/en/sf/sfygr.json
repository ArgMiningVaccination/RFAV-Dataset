Yesterday ten biopharma company representatives met with the President to outline how to quickly develop and deploy treatments, tests, and vaccines for COVID19. President Trump [entreated the companies](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-to-meet-with-pharmaceutical-executives-as-second-coronavirus-death-in-us-reported-2020-03-02) to work as quickly and efficiently as possible. Recently, PhRMA [outlined some of the efforts](https://catalyst.phrma.org/helping-those-affected-by-the-coronavirus), noting that \"As leaders of global R&D organizations within the biopharmaceutical industry and as scientists, physicians and public health professionals, we share the concern over this serious global public health threat\" and that as a group, \"[w]e stand in solidarity with patients and medical colleagues in China and around the world as we race to understand and contain this new outbreak.\" As noted in the [press release](https://phrma.org/Press-Release/Statement-on-Biopharmaceutical-Industry-Efforts-to-Address-the-Coronavirus-Public-Health-Emergency), some companies have started or accelerated development of vaccines and antiviral therapies: companies, along with government, academic experts, and charitable organizations, are all working to identify and develop new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat the disease. PhRMA members [are assisting in the efforts](https://catalyst.phrma.org/helping-those-affected-by-the-coronavirus) via: research and development, partnerships, monetary and in-kind support, and supply chain integrity. Research and Development Companies have donated compounds with the potential to treat coronavirus for emergency use and clinical trials, including compounds formerly tested on other viral pathogens such as Ebola and HIV. There are also other companies focused on researching vaccine candidates and undertaking inventories of research portfolio libraries to identify additional potential treatments for R&D. Companies are also exploring ways to leverage existing technologies that provide the ability to rapidly upscale production once a potential vaccine candidate is identified. Partnerships Companies are collaborating various United States and global public health authorities including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as the World Health Organization (WHO), public health authorities in China (including the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention) and the European Medicines Agency, to address this public health crisis. The collaborations are focused on all areas of R&D, including: - evaluating the different ways pandemic preparedness platforms can be tailored to address the coronavirus emergency, - leveraging existing R&D partnerships to accelerate development of antiviral agents against COVID-19 and - contributing resources and expertise to various R&D associations/organizations. Monetary and in-kind support Companies are also committing millions of dollars in both monetary and in-kind contributions to support organizations who are able to have an immediate impact for infected patients and communities in China. Some companies acted immediately and have donated critical supplies including advanced surgical equipment, antibiotics, disinfection equipment, batch virus testing devices (e.g., throat swabs), vitamins, protective clothing, goggles, masks, gloves and more, directly to China. Supply chain integrity Finally, as the situation continues to evolve, pharmaceutical companies continue to prioritize the continuity of their supply chains and are being proactive to prevent and mitigate any potential shortages through close coordination with the FDA and global stakeholders. According to public statements by the FDA, there are no shortages or delays in production reported by manufacturers. "}
