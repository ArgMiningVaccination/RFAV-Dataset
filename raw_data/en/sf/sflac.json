The little something that separates us from all other substances on the planet; that spark of energy that animates each cell of our body is LIFE! The inner intelligence, the higher consciousness that manifests itself, utilizes the intricacies of our brain and nerve system. Within each one of us is that personal energy that maintains us and allows us to adapt to our environment and resist dis-ease. Chiropractors call this energy \"Innate Intelligence\". This energy carries us through our lives and allows us to express ourselves to our fullest potential. This life force is give to us at conception. This Innate Intelligence utilizes the brain and the nerve system to control and coordinate the function of the body, just like the conductor uses the orchestra to make music. Spinal misalignment and nerve interference (vertebral subluxation) when present in the body, decrease the nerve energy (communication) from the brain to the body and from the body to the brain, a vital loop. Any disruption in this loop can cause what Chiropractors call \"Dis-ease\". \"Dis-ease\" is not necessarily a disease, it is the less than optimum functioning of your body, that left uncorrected can progress into the disease. Modern Chiropractic is the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation. Vertebral Subluxation interferes with the body?s Innate (inborn) Intelligence which is responsible for maintaining chemical, physical and mental balance in the body. This process must also occur as the environment changes. Any interference with the spark of life that flows down from your brain through your nervous system is the concern of the Chiropractor. Let's not confuse Chiropractic with the diagnosis or treatment of any condition or disorder. If you have a spine and vertebral subluxation, you are a candidate for Chiropractic care. Symptoms are not required in the process of detecting and removing vertebral subluxation. Proper nerve flow from an early age (birth) makes the most sense to those who understand the origins of true health. Chiropractors remove vertebral subluxations in those who desire a higher level of health and life. At the end of their lives, most people would give all they have to regain their health. Health once gone, is difficult if not impossible to restore. Plan now to regain and maintain "}
