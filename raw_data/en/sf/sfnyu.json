Average Monthly Cost per Indiv idual Served: HCS Residential Definition This measure captures the average cost per month for serving Medicaid Non- Residential HCS waiver individuals. Purpose This measure quantifies the unit cost for providing eligible individuals with services for which funding has been appropriated. It allows the agency to track the cost of HCS waiver- funded services over time, helps to maintain the fiscal integrity of the program by ensuring the availability of funds within appropriated resources and is a tool for projecting future funding needs. Data Source This measure is derived from enrollment and billing data, which are provided on a monthly basis. The calculation uses the average billing rate per individual from the HCS billing system for the residential slot type. Since there is a 95 -day billing window for the waiver programs, the average billing rate is an average of the prior months that are complete. The calculation also uses the monthly number of individuals enrolled from the CARE system for the r esidential slot type. The enrollment report provides the number of individuals entering and leaving by slot type. The ending enrollment balance at the end of the month represents the beginning balance for the next month by slot type. This combination of enrollments and average billing rates is used rather tha n utilizing the billing system alone because of the 95 -day billing window for submitting claims. HHSC Strategic Plan for 2021 -2025 Schedule B: List of Measure Definitions B-48 Methodology For the residential slot type within the HCS program, the average billing rate for each month is multiplied by the number enrolled for those same m onths to determine a monthly expenditure amount. The monthly expenditure amount and number o f individuals enrolled for the residential slot type within HCS are aggregated into a total monthly expenditure amount and total number of individuals enrolled duri ng the reporting period. Then the expenditure amount is divided by the aggregated number of individuals enrolled for an average monthly cost per individual for the reporting quarter. Data Limitations Original claims for services provided may be submitted b y providers of waiver services up to 95 days after the end of the service month. Therefore, for the current quarter, the numerator is an estimated expenditure amount based on prior period billing data , and the denominator is the number of actual enrollments for the current quarter.

Since there is a 95 -day billing window for the waiver programs, the average billing rate is an average of the prior months that are complete. The calculation also uses the monthly number of individuals enrolled from the CARE system for the non -residential slot type. The enrollment report pro vides the number of individuals entering and leaving by slot type. The ending enrollment balance at the end of the month represents the beginning balance for the next month by slot type. This combination of enrollments and average billing rates is used rather than utilizing the billing system alone because of the 95 -day billing window for submitting claims. Methodology For the non-residential slot type within the HCS program, the average billing rate for each month is multiplied by the number enrolled for those same months to determine a monthly expenditure amount. The monthly expenditure amount and number of individuals enrolled for the non-residential slot type within HCS are aggregated into a total monthly expenditure amount and total number of individuals enrolled during the reporting period. Then the expenditure amount is divided by the aggregated number of individuals enrolled for an average monthly cost per individual for the reporting quarter. Data Limitations Original claims for services provided may be submitted by providers of waiver services up to 95 days after the end of the service month. Therefore, for the current quarter, the numerator is an estimated expenditure amount based on prior period billing data , and the denominator is the number of actual enrollments for the current quarter.

Number of Individuals Receiving Services at the End of the Fiscal Ye ar: Home and Community -Based Services Definition This measure provides an unduplicated workload count of priority population eligible individuals receiving intellectual disability Medicaid HCS waiver- funded services at the end of the fiscal year. Purpose Due to the high demand for these services, as indicated by the number of individuals waiting for waiver services, it is critical for the commission to monitor how many individuals are receiving the service annually in order to determine the service level t hat will be carried into the nex t fiscal year and/or bienn ium. Data Source The providers of HCS waiver services submit Medicaid claims for the services provided during each month. The numbers of individuals served is taken from a standard production report. Methodology This is a simple unduplicated count of individuals who received HCS waiver services at the end of the fiscal year. Data Limitations Original claims for services provided may be submitted by providers of waiver services up to 95 days after the end of the service month. If the original claim is rejected for payment for any reason, the provider has up to 180 days from the end of the original service month to correct the claim and re -bill it. Since the documentation of a service being provided to an individual is based on these claims, accurate counts of numbers served during a fiscal year may not be available for several months past the fiscal year. Values reported in the Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) can be updated when the appropriation year closes and the LBB reopens the system.

Output 6.1.2.1. Average Number of Individuals Served per Month: Non-Medicaid Community Care ( Title XX/G eneral Revenue ) Definition This measure reports the monthly average unduplicated number of individuals who received one or more of the following Non -Medicaid Community Care (XX/GR) services: adult foster care, client managed personal assistance services, day activity and health services , emergency response services, home -delivered meals, personal assistance services (Family Care), residential care, and special services for persons with disabilities. Purpose This measure provides a count of eligibl e persons who are receiving Non -Medicaid Community Care (XX /GR) services that contribute to enabling them to remain in their own home as opposed to being placed in another more restrictive setting. Data Source Month- of-service to -date data that report the unduplicated number of individuals for whom claims have been approved- to-pay are obtained from claims payment data provided by the Medicaid claims ad ministrator that are accessed and reported through an agency -developed application that utilizes Cog nos software . Methodology For the most part, the number of individuals ultimately receiving services are estimated by the \"completion factor\" method explained above, applied to claims data to -date. However, because of the normal amount of variation which occurs in processing billings from month to month, the estimated census values estimated through the \"completion factor\" method are over- ridden for service mo nths in which fewer than three payment periods of data are available. (Or additional months if necessary, based upon analyst judgment.) For these s ervice months, the census values are estimated by using the historical ratio of individuals served (based upon HHSC Strategic Plan for 2021 -2025 Schedule B: List of Measure Definitions B-155 claims data) to individuals authorized to receive the service (per the Service Authorization System ). Data Limitations Because it takes several months to close out 100 percent of the claims for a month of service, the number of individuals as well as cost per individual per month ultimately served must be estimated for months that have not yet closed out, by using \"completion factors \" specific to each service applied to the number of individuals approved- to-pay to -date and/or the number of individuals authorized to receive services, the units of service approved- to-pay to -date, and the payment amounts approved- to-pay to -date. The concept of complet ion factors is that data, as of a given number of claims processing months after the month of service, can be considered a certain percent complete based upon historical patterns. Therefore, for a given month of service, the payment amounts approved -to-pay to-date divided by the appropriate completion factor equals the estimated expenditures ultimately incurred.

Average M onthly Cost per Individual Receiving Community Services Definition This measure captures information regarding what it costs the state each month, on average, to provide community intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) services to each individual who is assigned to these services regardless of age. It measures the HHSC appropriation authority cost per individual as defined by the companion output measure. Purpose This measure captures H HSC appropriation authority cost per person for adult and child community IDD services. Data Source At the end of each quarter, staff of the local authorities input expenditure information into the CARE portion o f the data warehouse system. The local authority indicates the fund sources used to finance the expenditures. The method of finance includes funds that are part of the HHSC appropriation authority as well as other local funds, grant funds, and earned revenues. Methodology HHSC appropriation authority funds include all GR and Federal Funds allocated through the performance contract. Also included are administrative claiming funds that the local authority receives following the submission of quarterly cost reports. The number of months in the repo rting period is 3 for each quarter and either 3, 6, 9, or 12 for year -to-date. The numerator is the total HHSC appropriation authority funds utilized to fund IDD community services as reported in CARE / the number of months in the reporting period. The denominator is the average monthly number of individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities receiving community services that are served with HHSC appropriation authority funds. The formula is numerator/denominator. Data Limitations The accuracy of the commission's database is dependent upon accurate and timely information 's being entered into the data warehouse system by the local authorities. If the local authority does not provide accurate data for the quarter, this measure will not be accurate . (At the end of the fiscal year, community centers HHSC Strategic Plan for 2021 -2025 Schedule B: List of Measure Definitions B-157 report preliminary expenditure information, whi ch is used for reporting i n ABEST. Final expenditure information may be entered into the CARE s ystem up to four months following the end of the fiscal year.

Quarterly and year- to-date performance is stated as the average of the months in the reporting period. Purpose Monthly number of adults and children served reflects the system -wide level of activity occurring over time and allows the agency to associate this activity with related costs. Data Source As individuals enter the comm unity programs, registration info rmation is entered into the C ARE porti on of the data warehouse system by staff of the local authority. When an individual is ass igned to a specific program, this information is also entered into the data warehouse system. Production reports of individuals served are issued quarterly based on the information in the data warehouse system. The HHSC Strategic Plan for 2021 -2025 Schedule B: List of Measure Definitions B-158 total unduplicated number of individuals assigned to receive any IDD community service each month is calculated. To obtain an unduplicated number of individuals, each individual is counted only once each period regardless of the number of different community services to which assigned. For each quarter of the fiscal year, the unduplicated number of individuals served in each month of the quarter is averaged. The production report lists total number of adults and children assigned to a particular service each month regardless of how the services fo r the individuals were funded. Methodology To obtain the number of individuals served with HHSC appropriation authority funds, HHSC uses a production report which reflects the numbers of priority population individuals served each month with GR funds and required local match. The numerator is the sum of the number of individuals receiving IDD community service each month of the reporting period. The denominator is the number of months in the period. The formula is numerator/denominator.

Percent Long -Term Care Ombudsman Complaints Resolved or Partially Resolved Definition The percent of Long -Term Care Ombudsman Program complaints resolved or partially resolved is defined as the percent of complaints received by the Long- Term Care Ombudsman Program and resolved either totally or partially to the satisfaction of the complainant. A complaint is defined as a concern brought to, or initiated by, the certified ombudsman for investigation and action by or on behalf of one or more residents of a long- term care facility relating to health, safety, welfare, or rights of a resident. A resident is an individual living in a nursing home or assisted living facility. Purpose This outcome measure analyzes Long -Term Care Ombudsman Program effectiveness in responding to complaints made by or on behalf of residents of nursing facilities and assisted living facilities. The measure allows decision- makers and state agency staff to identify trends of the program. State agency staff may also identify opportunities for training and technical assistance to the local Long - Term Care Ombudsman Programs. Data Source Data are reported by local Long -Term Care Ombudsman Programs in the format specified by HHSC . Methodology The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of resolved complaints by the total number of complaints that were clos ed. When closed, the thre e disposition categories are: 1) Partially or fully resolved to the satisfaction of the resident, resident representative , or complainant; 2) Withdrawn or no action needed by the HHSC Strategic Plan for 2021 -2025 Schedule B: List of Measure Definitions B-192 resident, resident representative , or complainant; and 3) Not resolved to the satisfaction of the resident, resident representative, or complainant. Data Limitations All complaints received by the Long -Term Care Ombudsman Program are documented in the statewide -operated database. Only complain ts reported as closed and with a disposition status are included in the calculation. Calculation Method Noncumulative New Measure No Target Attainment Currently not determined.

Average Monthly Number Individuals w ith Intellectual Disability Receiving Assessment and Service Coordination Definition This measure captures the unduplicated count of priority population, as defined by local authorities ' performance contract, eligible individual s whose services are funded with HHSC funds and who receive IDD community assessment and/or service coordination services. Assessment services are monthly services. Service coordination services may occur quarterly but are most frequently monthly services. Quarterly and year- to-date performance is stated as the average of the months in the reporting period, regardless of how the services for the individuals were funded. HHSC Strategic Plan for 2021 -2025 Schedule B: List of Measure Definitions B-193 Purpose Monthly number of individuals served reflects the system -wide level of activity occurring over time and allows the agency to associate this activity with related costs. Data Source Month- of-service to -date data that report, by type -of-service, the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved- to-pay, the number of units of service approved- to-pay, and the amounts approved -to-pay are obtained from the commiss ion's Claims Management System by means of ad hoc query. Methodology To obtain the number of individuals served with HHSC appropriation authority funds, the numerator is the sum of the number of individuals receiving IDD assessment and/or service coordination services each month of the reporting period; the denominator is the number of months in the period. The formula is numerator/denominator. Data Limitations Because it takes 365 days to close out 100 percent of the claims for a month of service, the number of individuals ultimately served must be estimated for months that have not yet closed out, by using \" completion factors \" specific to each service applied to the numbe r of individuals approved- to-pay to -date and/or the number of individuals authorized to receive services. The concept of completion factors is that data, as of a given number of claims processing months after the month of service, can be considered a certain percent complete based upon historical patterns. Therefore, for a given month of service, the number of persons on approved -to-pay claims to -date divided by the appropriate completion factor equals the estimated number of persons ultimately served.

Data Source The sources of recovery data include O IG case management systems, the claims administrator system and databases, and data reported from other HHS programs that directly recover fu nds based on O IG activities. O IG operating expenditure data are extracted from the HHS CAPPS Financial System. O IG staff compile recovery data from the respective source systems and activities in a consolidated O IG-wide tracking sys tem on a monthly basis, and those data are then compared to total expenditure data across the OIG for the same reporting period. Methodology For the given reporting period, the sum of estimated state dollars recovered from all OIG divisions (including Investigations, Inspections, Audit, and Litigation) is reduced by total O IG expenditures (in GR ) and by estimated GR collected by the HHSC Strategic Plan for 2021 -2025 Schedule B: List of Measure Definitions B-197 Medicaid recovery audit contractor. This quantity is then divided by total O IG expenditures in All Funds. The result is then reported as a dollar figure. Calculation: (recoveries - expenditures) / e xpenditures, expressed as a percentage. The percentage is then converted to a dollar figure (e.g. 30 percent ROI = $1.30 recovered per $1 e xpended).

Health and Human Services System Strategic Plan s for 2021- 2025 Schedule C: Historically Underutilized Businesses Plan As Required by Texas Government Code Section 2161.123 Health and Human Services Commission Department of State Health Services May 2020 This page intentionally left blank. 1 1. Introduction The Health and Human Services (HHS) System administers programs to encourage participation by historically underutilized businesses (HUBs) in all contracting and subcontracting by HHS agencies. The HHS System's HUB Programs are designed to enhance the ability of HUBs to compete for HHS System contracts, increase agencies' awareness of such businesses, ensure meaningful HUB participation in the procurement process and assist HHS System agencies in achieving their HUB goals. Each state agency is required to include in its strategic plan a HUB plan. The section below describes, in its entirety, a coordinated HUB plan that covers the HHS System's HUB programs as a whole. 2. Goal The goal of the HHS System HUB Plan is to promote fair and competitive business opportunities that maximize the inclusion of minority, woman and service -disabled veteran- owned businesses that are certified HUBs in the procurement and contracting activities of HHS System agencies. 3. Objective The HHS System strives to meet or exceed the Statewide Annual HUB Utilization Goals and/or agency -specific goals that are identified each fiscal year in the procurement categories related to the HHS System's current strategies and programs. 4. Outcome Measures In accordance with Texas Government Code Section 2161(d)(5) and the State's Disparity Study, state agencies are required to establish their own HUB goals based HHSC Strategic Plan for 2021 -2025, Part II Schedule C: Historically Underutilized Businesses Plan 2 on scheduled fiscal year expenditures and the availability of HUBs in each procurement category. The HHS System has adopted the Statewide HUB Goals as the agency -specific goals. In procuring goods and services through contracts, the HHS System, as well as each of its individual agencies, will make a good -faith effort to meet or exceed the statewide goals, as described in Table 1, for contracts the agency expects to award in a fiscal year. Table 1: Statewide HUB Goals by Procurement Categories, Fiscal Year 2020 PROCUREMENT CATEGORIES UTILIZATION GOALS Heavy Construction 11.20% Building Construction 21.10% Special Trade Construction 32.90% Professional Services Contracts 23.70% Other Services Contracts 26.00% Commodity Contracts 21.10% Source: Data from F iscal Year 2018 Statewide HUB Report, Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. The HHS System will collectively use the following outcome measure to gauge progress: Total expenditures and the percentage of purchases awarded directly and indirectly through subcontracts to HUBs under the procurement categories. Each HHS System agency may track additional outcome measures. HHSC Strategic Plan for 2021 -2025, Part II Schedule C: Historically Underutilized Businesses Plan 3 5. HHS System Strategies The HHS System maintains and implements policies and procedures, in accordance with the HUB statute and rules, to guide the agencies in increasing the use of HUBs by contracting directly and/or indirectly through subcontracting. The HHS System employ s several additional strategies, such as: Implementing policies to ensure good faith effort requirements are performed and maintained from the development of the solicitation through the duration of the c ontract Utilizing the Centralized Master Bidders List and HUB Directory to solicit bids from HUBs Maintaining a HUB Program Office of HUB Coordinators at HHSC headquarters for effective coordination for all HHS agencies Developing and implementing reporting practices to provide updates to the Executive Commissioner, Chief Operating Officer, Deputy Executive Commissioners and Associate Commissioners on HHS HUB Program activities, related initiatives and projects Developing target- marketing strategies inclusi ve of web -based training to provide guidance on HHS System procurements Maintaining an active upcoming Procurement Forecast schedule on website to provide notices of opportunities prior to posting to encourage HUB participation Increasing awareness of the HUB Program across the HHS System by providing information to all new employees on how they may assist in the efforts to increase HUB utilization Enhancing outreach efforts internally and externally by promoting access, awareness, and accountability through education and training Increasing HUB participation in Spot Bid purchases by mandating the agency solicit a HUB for purchases starting at $3,000 to $5,000 6. Output Measures The HHS System will collectively use and individually track the following output measures to gauge progress: HHSC Strategic Plan for 2021 -2025, Part II Schedule C: Historically Underutilized Businesses Plan 4 The total number of bids received from HUBs The total number of contracts awarded to HUBs The total amount of HUB subcontracting expenditures The total amount of HUB Procurement Card expenditures The total number of mentor- prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements The total number of HUBs provided assistance in becoming HUB certified Additional output measures which may be used by specific System agencies: The total number of outreach initiatives such as HUB forums attended and sponsored The total number of HUB trainings provided to the vendor community as well as internally to agency staff 7. HUB External Assessment According to the Comptroller of Public Accounts the HHS System collectively awarded 15.11% for fiscal year 2018, and 11.98% for fiscal year 2019. Tables 2 and 3 reflect utilization for HHSC and DSHS total spending with HUBs directly and indirectly through subcontracting use.

The HHS System agencies continuously strive to make internal improvements to meet or exceed HUB goals. HHS System agencies continued outreach efforts to educate HUBs and minority businesses about the procurement process. Other areas of progress include: Maintainin g relationships with the Texas Association of African- American Chambers of Commerce and the Texas Association of Mexican- American Chambers of Commerce among other organizations focused on small minority, wom an, and/or service -disabled veteran- owned busines ses Conducting post- contract award meetings with contractors to discuss HUB Subcontracting Plan compliance and monthly reporting requirements Additional goals include: Enhancing minority/woman/services -disabled veteran- owned business participation in HHS S ystem -sponsored HUB Forums where exhibitors may participate in trade -related conferences Enhancing HHS System HUB reporting capabilities Expanding HHS System mentor- prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program vision to maximize the state's resources through cooperation and assistance from other public entities and corporate businesses Promoting and increasing awareness of HHS System procurement opportunities for direct and indirect capacity This page intentionally left blank.

F-5 1. Executive Summary The Health and Human Services (HHS) System Strategic Staffing Analysis and Workforce Plan is an integral part of HHS' staffing plan. Workforce planning is a business ne cessity due to a number of factors, including: constraints on funding; increasing demand for HHS services; increasing number of current employees reaching retirement age resulting in fewer, less experienced workers available as replacements; and increasing competition for highly skilled employees. HHS agencies are proactively addressing this challenge by preparing for the future and reducing risks. Designed for flexibility, the HHS System Strategic Staffing Analysis and Workforce Plan allows HHS executive m anagement to make staffing adjustments according to the changing needs of HHS agencies. State leaders in Texas recognize the importance of workforce planning. As part of their strategic plans, state agencies are required under the Texas Government Code, Se ction 2056.0021, to develop a workforce plan in accordance with the guidelines developed by the State Auditor's Office (SAO). To meet these requirements, this Schedule attachment to the HHS System Strategic Plan for the Fiscal Years 2017 -2021 analyzes the following key elements for the entire HHS System: Current Workforce Demographics - Describes how many employees work for the and HHS agencies, where they work, what they are paid, how many of them are return -to-work retirees, how many have left HHS, how ma ny may retire, and whether or not minority groups are underutilized when compared to the state Civilian Labor Force (CLF) for Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) job categories. The workforce is examined by gender, race, age and length of state service. Expected Workforce Challenges - Describes anticipated staffing needs based on population trends, projected job growth and other demographic trends. A detailed examination of each identified shortage occupation was conducted to identify and understand retentio n and recruitment problems. Strategies to Meet Workforce Needs - Describes recruitment and retention strategies that address expected workforce challenges for shortage occupation jobs. The following is the detailed HHS System Strategic Staffing Analysis an d Workforce Plan. F-6 2. Health and Human Services The Health and Human Services System, as reflected in Article II of the General Appropriations Act, consist s of the two agencies described below : Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). HHSC began services in 1991. The agency administers programs previously administered by the Texas Department of Human Services. HHSC provides leadership to the HHS agencies , manages the day -to-day operations of state supported living centers and state hospitals, and administ ers programs that deliver benefits and services, including: Medicaid for families and children. Long-term care for people who are older or who have disabilities. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program food benefits and Temporary Assistance for Needy Fam ilies cash assistance. Behavioral health services. Services to help keep people who are older or who have disabilities in their homes and communities. Services for women . Services for people with special health needs. The agency also oversees regulatory fu nctions including: Licensing and credentialing long -term care facilities, such as nursing homes and assisted living. Licensing child -care providers. Department of State Health Services (DSHS). DSHS includes programs previously administered by the Texas De partment of Health, the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse, and the Health Care Information Council. The agency began services on September 1, 2004 and continues to administer programs to promote and protect public health by creating better systems that include prevention, intervention and effective partnerships with communities across the state. The agency works to: Improve health outcomes through public and population health strategies, including prevention and intervention. Optimize public health response to disasters, disease threats, and outbreaks. Improve and optimize business functions and processes to support delivery of public health services in communities. Enhance operational structures to support public health functions of the state. Improve recognition and support for a highly skilled and dedicated workforce. Foster effective partnership and collaboration to achieve public health goals. F-7 Promote the use of science and data to drive decision -making and best practices. HHS V ision Making a positive difference in the lives of the people we serve. HHS Mission Improving the health, safety and well -being of Texans through good stewardship of public resources. F-8 3. Workforce Demographics With a total of 39,543 full-time and part -time employees, the HHS workforce has increased by about four percent (1 ,687 employees) in the period from August 31, 2017 to August 31, 201 9.1 2 3 Figure 1: HHS System Workforce for FY 17 - FY 19 Figure 2: HHS System Workforce for FY 19 F-9 Job Families Approximately 81 percent of HHS employees (31,923 employees) work in 23 job families.4 Table 1: Largest Program Job Families Job Family Number of Employees Direct Care Workers5 8,306 Eligibility Workers6 5,700 Clerical Workers 3,530 Registered Nurses (RNs)7 2,139 Program Specialists 2,030 Managers 1,120 Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs) 1,007 Rehabilitation Technicians 996 Food Service Workers8 877 Program Supervisors 859 System Analysts 712 Custodians 661 Maintenance Workers 576 Inspectors 575 Directors 461 Claims Examiners 449 Security Workers 408 Investigators 364 Contract Specialists 348 Accountants 329 Public Health Technicians 322 Training Specialists 312 Qualified Intellectual D isability Professionals 266 F-10 Gender Most HHS employees are female, making up about 7 3 percent of the HHS workforce. This breakdown is consistent across all HHS agencies.9 Table 2: HHS System Workforce Gender for FY 17 - FY 1910 11 12 Gender 71.5% 72.1% 72.6% Figure 3: HHS System Workforce by Gender for FY 19 Table 3: HHS Agencies by Gender Agency Percentage Male Percentage Female HHSC 27.4% 72.6% DSHS 27.8% 72.2% Ethnicity The workforce is diverse, with approximately 3 8 percent White, 30 percent Hispanic, 2 9 percent Black, and three percent Asian and Native American. This breakdown is consistent across all HHS agencies.13 Table 4: HHS System Workforce Ethnicity for FY 17 - FY 1914 15 16 Race FY 17 Asian 3.0% 3.3% 3.4% Figure 4: HHS System Workforce by Ethnicity for FY 19 Table 5: HHS Agencies by Ethnicity17 Agency Percentage White Percentage Black Percentage Hispanic Percentage Native American Percentage average age of an HHS worker is 4 4 years. This breakdown is consistent across all HHS agencies.18 Table 6: HHS System Workforce Age for FY 17 - FY 1919 20 21 Age FY 5: HHS System Workforce by Age for FY 19 Table 7: HHS Agencies by Age22 Agency Percentag e Under 30 Percentage 30-39 Percentage 40-49 Texas law requires that each state agency analyze its workforce and compare t he number of Blacks, Hispanics and females employed by the agency to the available state Civilian Labor Force (CLF) for each job category. The utilization analysis was conducted for each HHS agency using the 80 percent rule. This rule compares the actual n umber of employees to the expected number of employees based on the available state CLF for Black, Hispanic and female employees. For purposes of this analysis, a group is considered potentially underutilized when the actual representation in the workforce is less than 80 percent of what the expected number would be based on the CLF. The HHSC Civil Rights Office (CRO) reviewed and conducted analyses for each individual agency's workforce to identify potential underutilization. The utilization analysis of th e HHS agencies for fiscal year 2019 indicated potential underutilization in the HHSC workforce. The following table summarizes the results of the utilization analysis for the HHS System. Table 8: HHS System Utilization Analysis Resu lts23 24 25 Job Category HHS System HHSC DSHS Officials/Administrators No No No F-13 Job Category HHS System HHSC DSHS Professionals No No No Technicians No No No Protective Service No No N/A Administrative Support No No No Skilled Craft Black Hispanic Female Black Hispanic Female No N/A N/A Service Maintenance Hispanic Hispanic No Although potential underutilization was identified in the Skilled Craft job category, it should be noted that that job category comprises 1.5 percent of the HHS System workforce. The other job categor y showing po tential underutilization is Service Maintenance , which comprises 5.3 percent of the HHS System workforce. Figure 6: HHS System - Percent of Employees by Job Category F-14 Veterans About five percent of the workforce ( 1,832 employees ) are veterans. HHSC has the lowest percentage of veterans at 4. 5 percent ( 1,643 employees) and DSHS has the highest at 6.2 percent ( 189 employees).26 Table 9: HHS System Workforce by Veterans Status27 State Service Approximately 3 7 percent of the workforce has 10 or more years of state service. About a quarter of the workforce have been with the state for less than two years. This breakd own is consistent across all HHS agencies.28 Table 10: HHS System Workforce Length of State Service for FY 17 - FY 1929 30 31 32 Figure 7: HHS System Workforce by Length of State Service33 Agency Number of Veterans FY 19 FY 17 FY 38.3% 37.4% F-15 Table 11: HHS Agencies by Length of State Service34 Agency Percentage Less than 2 yrs. Percentage 2-4 yrs . Percentage 5-9 yrs . Employee Salary On average, the annual salary for an HHS System employee is $ 41,684 .35 Figure 8: HHS Average Annual Salary by Agency Return -to-Work Retirees HHS agencies hire retirees to support both ongoing operational needs and to assist in implementing new initiatives. When recruiting for shortage occupations, special skill required positions or for special projects, retirees provide a good source of relevant program -specific knowledge. Rehired retirees constitute about three percent of the total HHS workforce.36 F-16 Figure 9: HHS Return -to-Work Retirees by Percent of Workf orce HHS management understands that demographic trends over the next decade will increasingly impact recruitment from typical sources. Retired workers who have institutional knowledge will be needed to pass their expertise to others. Dealing with an aging workforce will require HHS agencies to attract more people to apply for work, encourage them to work longer and help make them more productive. Creative strategies will need to be devised to keep older workers on the job, such as hiring retirees as temps; letting employees phase into retirement by working part time; having experienced workers mentor younger employees; promoting telecommuting, flexible hours and job -sharing; and/or urging retirement -ready workers to take sabbaticals instead of stepping do wn. Legislative changes have posed additional challenges for recruiting retired workers. Beginning September 1, 2009, the amount of time a retired employee must wait before returning to state employment increased from 30 to 90 days. In addition, state agen cies that hire return -to-work retirees must pay the Employees Retirement System of Texas (ERS) a surcharge that is equal to the amount of the State's retirement contribution for an active employee. Of special concern to HHS is the possibility that the curr ent practice of rehiring retirees may inhibit talented staff from moving into management or other senior positions . To address this problem and ensure HHS considers and documents the selection of retirees, the System has adopted a policy that requires the hiring authority to consult with HHS Human Resources before offering a supervisory position to a retiree . F-17 4. Turnover The HHS System turnover rate for fiscal year 2019 was 27.69 percent, about s even percent higher than the statewide turnover rate of 20.3 percent.37 38 Table 12: HHS System Workforce - Turnover for FY 17 - FY 19 (excludes inter -HHS agency transfers) 39 Agency FY 17 FY 18 FY 19 HHS System 24.9% 27.3% 27.6% Of the two HHS agencies, HHSC experienced the highest turnover rate (28.3 percent) .40 Table 13: Turnover by HHS Agency for FY 19 (includes inter -HHS agency transfers and excludes legislatively mandated transfers) Agency Average Annual Headcount Total Separations Turnover Rate HHSC 38,883 27.6% Turnover at HHS agencies was highest for Males a t HHSC (at 30.2 percent) and lowest for Females at DSHS (at 18.4 percent).

Retirement Projec tions Currently, about 1 0 percent of the HHS workforce is eligible to retire and leave state employment. About 2. 6 percent of the eligible employees retire each fiscal year. If this trend continues, approximately 13 percent of the current workforce is expected to retire in the next five years.60 Table 18: HHS System Retirements - Percent of Workforce (FY 15 - FY 19) Fiscal Year Retirement Losses Retirement Turnover Rate 2015 1,396 2.4% 2016 HHS First -Time Retirement Eligible Projection (FY 19 - FY 24) Agency FY 19 FY of this significant portion of the workforce means the HHS agencies will lose some of their most knowledgeable workers, including many emplo yees in key positions. Effective succession planning and employee development will be critical in ensuring there are qualified individuals who can replace those leaving state service. F-22 6. Critical Workforce Skills The current climate of the information age, advances in technology, increasing population for the state, consolidation of services, right -sizing and outsourcing will continue to place increased emphasis on the demand for well -trained and skilled staff. The outsourcing and self -service automation of major HR functions, such as employee selection, have made it critical for HHS managers and employees to improve and commit to a continual learning of human resource policy, employee development, conflict resolution, time management, project management and automation skills. It is important for HHS to employ professionals who have the skills necessary for the development, implementation and evaluation of the health and human services programs. These skills include: Analytic/assessment skills; Policy developm ent/program planning skills; competency skills; Basic public health sciences skills; Financial planning and management skills; Contract management skills; and Leadership and systems -thinking skills. As the Spanish speaking po pulation in Texas increases, there will be an increased need for employees with bilingual skills, especially Spanish -English proficiency. In addition, most management positions require program knowledge. As HHS continues to lose tenured staff, effective tr aining will be needed to ensure that current employees develop the skills necessary to transfer into management positions. To promote this staff development, HHS must continue to grow the skills and talents of managers as part of a plan for succession. HHS has demonstrated this belief by establishing a HHS Leadership Academy, a formalized interagency training and mentoring program that provides opportunities to enhance the growth of high - potential managers as they take on greater responsibility in positions of leadership. The primary goals of the academy are to: prepare managers to take on higher and broader roles and responsibilities; provide opportunities for managers to better understand critical management issues; provide opportunities for managers to pa rticipate and contribute while learning; and create a culture of collaborative leaders across the HHS system. F-23 Through this planned development of management skills and the careful selection of qualified staff, HHS will continue to meet the challenges posed by increased retirements. F-24 7. Environmental Assessment The Texas Economy Texas added approximately 254,100 jobs in 2019. Texas job growth weakened slightly from 2.4 to 2.0 percent in 2019. 61 On March 19, 2020, Governor Abbot issued an executive order mandati ng the closure of nonessential businesses in Texas due to the novel coronavirus (COVID - 19) pandemic. Prior to the March 2020 shutdown of the Texas economy, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas forecast ed 2020 Texas job growth of 2.1 percent .62 It is unclear t o what extent pandemic -related closures will affect this job forecast, though it could have a profound impact on the recruitment and retention challenges facing HHS. Poverty in Texas As the number of families living in poverty increases for the state, the demand for services provided by the HHS System will also increase. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defined the poverty level for 2019 according to household/family size as follows: $25,750 or less for a family of four; $21,330 or less for a family of three; $16,910 or less for a family of two; and $12,490 or less for individuals.63 It is estimated that 14.9 percent of Texas residents live in families with annual incomes below the poverty level. This rate is slightly higher than the national poverty rate of 11.8 percent.64 Unemployment Another factor that directly impacts the demand for HHS System services is unemployment. In Texas, the August 201 9 statewide unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, slightly below the national rate of 3.7 percent.65 Due to the State mandate for social distancing surrounding the novel coronavirus pandemic and ensuing loss of jobs and/or hours worked, 2020 unemployment will likely rise, thus increasing the demand for HHS system services. Other Significant Factors Accordin g to the annual report produced by the Texas Demographic Center, every year since 2006, Texas has added more population than any other state. As of July 2018, the estimated population for Texas was over 28 million, which represents a F-25 14.9 percent increase from the census count in April 2010. Texas added over 3.55 million people between 2010 and 2018.66 The distribution of age groups in Texas closely mirrors that of the nation, with the largest percentage of Texas residents (59 percent) being between ages 19 to 64, followed by those 18 and under (27 percent) and those 65 and over (13 percent).67 Figure 10: Population Distribution by Age According to long term population projections by the Texas State Data Center, it is estimated that by 2050, Texans older than age 65 will triple in size from 2010 - 2050, approaching 7.9 million.68 F-26 8. Expected Workforce Challenges HHS will need to continue to recruit and retain health and human services professionals, such as psychiatrists, physicians, psycho logists, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses, registered therapists, dentists, sanitarians, health physicists, and medical technicians. Certain jobs will continue to be essential to the delivery of services throughout the HHS System. Many of the jobs are low paying, highly stressful and experience higher than normal turnover, such as eligibility s ervices staff, child care licensing and residential licensing specialists, direct care workers (direct support professionals and psychiatric nursing assistants) and food service workers. Additionally, the demand for certain public health positions (such as epidemiologists, laboratory staff, and public health and prevention specialists) is expected to increase as the pandemic response t o COViD -19 continues to evolve. Direct Care Workers (Direct Support Professionals and Psychiatric Nursing Assistants) There are about 8, 306 direct care workers employed in HHS state hospitals and state supported living centers. These positions require no f ormal education to perform the work, but employees are required to develop people skills to effectively interact with patients and residents . The physical requirements of the position are difficult and challenging due to the nature of the work. The pay is low, with an average hourly rate of $12. 67.69 The overall turnover rate for employees in this group is very high, at about 50 percent annually.70 Taking into account these factors, state hospitals and state supported living centers have historically experien ced difficulty in both recruiting and retaining these workers. Little change is expected. Direct Support Professionals There are 5, 694 direct support professionals in state supported living centers across Texas, representing approximately 14 percent of the System's total workforce.71 These employees provide 24 -hour direct care to almost 3 ,000 people who reside in state supported living centers. They directly support these individuals by providing services including basic hygiene needs, dressing and bathing, general health care, and dining assistance. They support life -sustaining medical care such as external feeding and lifting individuals with physical challenges. A trained and experienced direct care staff is essential to ensure resident safety, health and well-being. There are no formal education requirements to apply for a job in this series; however, extensive on -the-job training is required. It takes six to nine months for a new direct support professional to become proficient in the basic skills necessa ry to carry out routine job duties. F-27 Employees who perform this work must interact with residents on a daily basis. The work is performed in shifts throughout the day and night. The pay is low and the work is difficult and physically demanding. A typical HH S direct support professional is 38 years old and has about six years of state service.72 Turnover for direct support professionals is very high, at about 54 percent. This is one of the highest turnover rates of any job category in the System , reflecting th e loss of about 3, 455 workers during fiscal year 201 9. Within this job family, entry - level Direct Support Professional Is experienced the highest turnover at approximately 6 8 percent. Turnover rates by location ranged from 43 percent at El Paso State Suppo rted Living Center to 75 percent at the Brenham State Supported Living Center.73 The average hourly salary rate for these employees is $12.68 per hour.74 The State Auditor's Office 2018 market index analysis found the average state salary for Direct Support Professional I and I IIs to range from 14 to 10 percent behind the market rate.75 Psychiatric Nursing Assistants There are approximately 2, 612 psychiatric nursing assistants employed in HHS state hospitals.76 These positions require high school education or e quivalency to perform the work; however, there is extensive on -the-job training. Workers are assigned many routine basic care tasks in the state hospitals that do not require a license to perform, such as taking vital signs, and assisting with bathing, hyg iene and transportation. These employees are required to interact with patients on a daily basis. They are likely to be the first to intervene during crisis situations, and are the frontline staff most likely to de -escalate situations to avoid the need for behavioral interventions . They also have a higher potential for on -the- job injuries, both from lifting requirements and intervention during crisis situations. Further complicating this situation, many of the applicants for these entry -level positions lack the experience needed to work with patients and often lack the physical ability necessary to carry out their job duties. The work is performed in shifts throughout the day and night. The work is difficult and the pay is low. Psychiatric nursing assistants earn an average hourly wage of $12.62 per hour. The State Auditor's Office 2018 market index analysis found the average state salary for a Psychiatric Nursing Assistant I was 14 percent behind the market rate.77 78 The average psychiatric nursing assistant is about 3 9 years old and has an average of seven years of state service.79 Turnover for psychiatric nursing assistants is very high at about 42 percent, reflecting the loss of 1, 263 workers during fiscal year 201 9. Within this job family, entry-level Psych iatric Nursing Assistant Is experienced the highest turnover at 56 percent. Turnover rates by location ranged from 17 percent at Austin State Hospital to 68 percent at the Big Spring State Hospital.80 F-28 HHS is currently experiencing difficulty filling vacant psychiatric nursing assistant positions. Vacant positions are going unfilled for many months. Positions at the Big Spring State Hospital are remaining vacant, on average, for a lmost six months.81 HHS is developing a staffing pool at certain state hospitals to reduce the need for overtime as well as an Intensive Observation Unit to reduce the need for 1:1 staffing for high risk individuals. Recruitment and retention of these employees remains a major challenge for the System. Food Service Workers HHS employs approximately 877 food service workers.82 Working conditions can be very demanding and there are no formal education requirements. Since meals are prepared seven days a week, some of these employees are required to work on night and weekend shifts. The aver age hourly rate paid to food service workers is $11.10.83 Turnover in food service worker positions is very high, at about 40 percent during fiscal year 201 9.84 The State Auditor's Office 201 8 market index analysis found the average state salary for Food Ser vice Workers ranged from one to 12 percent behind the market rate; Food Service Managers ranged from four to 15 percent behind the market rate; and Cooks ranged from two to seven percent behin d the market rate.85 Retention and recruitment of these workers r emains a major challenge for the System. Food Service Workers at State Supported Living Center There are 5 55 food service workers employed in HHS state supported living centers throughout Texas.86 The typical food service worker is about 45 years of age and has an average of approximately nine years of state service.87 Turnover in these food service worker positions is very high, at 42 percent. Turnover is at nearly 69 percent at the Corpus Christi State Supported Living Center.88 Food Service Workers at State Hospitals There are 3 12 food service workers employed at HHS state hospitals and centers throughout Texas.89 The typical food service worker is about 46 years of age and has an average of about seven years of state service.90 Turnover in these food service worker positions is high, at 36 percent. Turnover was nearly 4 4 percent at the Terrell State Hospital.91 F-29 Food Service Workers at TCID There are ten food service workers employed in the Texas Center for Infectious Disease (TCID) .92 The typical food service wo rker is about 4 3 years of age and has an average of approximately seven years of state service.93 Turnover in these food service worker positions is very high, at 48 percent.94 Eligibility Services Staff Across the state, there are about 7, 767 employees supp orting eligibility determinations within the System, accounting for about 20 percent of the HHS System workforce.95 The majority of these individuals ( 7,284 employees or 9 4 percent) are employed as Texas works advisors, medical eligibility specialists, hosp ital based workers, eligibility clerks and eligibility supervisors.96 Overall turnover for Eligibility Services Staff is higher than the state average rate of about 20 percent (at about 2 3 percent), with Texas works advisors experiencing the highest turnove r at 25 percent, followed by medical eligibility specialists at 2 4 percent and eligibility clerks at 20 percent.97 98 Texas Works Advisors There are over 4, 700 Texas works advisors within HHS that make eligibility determinations for SNAP, TANF, CHIP and Medi caid for children, families and pregnant women. The typical Texas works advisor is 4 1 years of age and has an average of about seven years of service.99 Turnover for these employees is high at about 2 5 percent, representing a loss of 1,250 workers in fiscal year 201 9. Certain regions of Texas experienced higher turnover than others, including Northwest/West Texas at 35 percent and the Metroplex at 34 percent. Entry -level Texas Works Advisor Is experienced the highest turnover at 4 5 percent.100 In addition, HHS has experienced difficulty finding qualified candidates for new worker positions. Due to this shortage of qualified applicants, vacant positions go unfilled for an average of almost five months, with vacant positions in Upper East Texas remaining unfilled for an average of a little more than nine months.101 Salary is one factor that may be contributing to the System's difficulty recruiting and retaining eligibility workers. Recruitment and retention of these employees remain a continuing challenge for HHS. Medical Eligibility Specialists Within HHS, there are 6 54 medical eligibility specialists determining financial eligibility for Medicaid for Elderly and People with Disabilities (MEPD). Medical F-30 eligibility specialists have, on average, about eight years of state service, with an average age of 4 2.102 Turnover for these employees is high at about 2 4 percent, representing the loss of 161 employees in fiscal year 201 9. Entry -level Medical Eligibility Specialist Is experienced the highest turnover, at 4 3 percent.103 Retention of these specialists is an ongoing challenge. Hospital Based Workers HHS has about 2 83 hospital based workers stationed in nursing facilities, hospitals, and clinics rather than in eligibility offices to determine eligibility for the SNAP, TANF, CHIP and Medicaid programs. These highly -tenured workers have an average of about 1 3 years of state service (about 54 percent of these employees have 10 or more years of state service), with an average age of 4 5.104 Turnover for these employees is currently below the state average (of 20 percent) at about 1 6 percent.105 106 Eligibility Clerks HHS employs about 1, 070 eligibility clerks in various clerical, administrative assistant and customer service representative positions. The typical eligibility clerk is 48 years of age and has an average of 1 0 years of state service.107 The turnover rate for eligibility clerks is high at about 20 percent, representing the loss of about 2 22 employees ( about one percent higher rate than reported for fiscal year 201 7).108 109 Eligibi lity Specialist Clerk IIIs made up the majority of these losses at about 7 7 percent, with these positions often remaining unfilled for an average of about four and a half months.110 111 Recruitment and retention for these jobs are ongoing challenges. Eligibili ty Supervisors Over 500 eligibility supervisors are employed within HHS. These highly -tenured supervisors have an average of 1 7 years of state service ( about 77 percent of these employees have 10 or more years of state service), with an average age of 46.112 Though turnover for these employees is well managed at about 1 2 percent, this represents a two percent higher turnover rate than reported for fiscal year 201 7.113 114 Within the next five years, over 35 percent of these employees will be eligible to retire.115 HHS will need to develop effective succession plans and creative recruitment strategies to replace these highly skilled and tenured employees. F-31 Child Care Licensing (CCL) and Residential Child Care Licensing (RCCL) Specialists There are 345 CCL and RCCL spe cialists employed within the System who monitor, investigate and inspect child day -care facilities and homes, residential child care facilities, child -placing agencies and foster homes.116 117 In addition, they conduct child abuse/neglect investigations of chi ldren placed in 24 -hour childcare facilities and child placing agencies licensed or certified by Residential Child Care Licensing. The typical specialist is 39 years of age and has an average of eight years of state service. Nearly h alf of these employees have less than five years of state service.118 CCL and RCCL specialist turnover is high at 25 percent.119 Retention of these employees is an ongoing challenge. Guardianship Staff Within the Office of Guardianship Services (OGS), the HHS System employs 81 Guard ianship Specialists and Supervisors who are responsible for providing guardianship services to eligible clients. 120 Staff continuously assess and determine whether guardianship is the most appropriate and least restrictive alternative necessary to ensure the consumer's health and safety. Retention and turnover continue to be a challenge, since these positions require specialized skills and salaries are not comparable with that paid by other agencies and the private sector. Guardianship Specialists There are 68 guardianship specialists employed at HHS.121 The typical System guardianship specialist i s about 45 years old and has an average of about 1 1 years of state service. Nearly half of the employees have 10 years or more of state service.122 The overall turnover rate for System guardianship specialists is high, at 21 percent annually , which is slightly above the state average turnover rate of 20 percent .123 124 Vacant System guardianship specialist positions often go unfilled for many months due to a shortage of quali fied applicants available for work.125 These vacancy problems are expected to worsen as employees approach retirement. About 19 percent of these tenured and highly skilled employees will be eligible to retire in the next five years.126 Guardianship Supervisors There are 13 guardianship supervisors working for HHS.127 System guardianship supervisors have, on average, about 1 7 years of state service, with an average age of about 51 years.128 F-32 Though t he turnover rate for these highly tenured guardianship supervisors is currently well managed at about eight percent, HHS may face significant recruitment challenges in the next few years to replace these highly skilled and tenured employees who are eligible for retirement. With about 23 percent of these employees are curre ntly eligible to retire, this rate will increase in the next five years to about 46 percent.129 130 Provider Investigators There are about 146 provider investigators with HHS Regulatory Services.131 These employees investigate reports of abuse, neglect, and expl oitation of adults and children with mental illness or intellectual, developmental, and physical disabilities. Investigations occur in a variety of settings such as facilities, group homes, and private residences. The typical provider investigator is 40 ye ars of age and has an average of eight years of state service. About 47 percent of these employees have less than five years of state service.132 Provider investigator positions have a high turnover rate. During fiscal year 2019, provider investigator turnov er was slightly higher than the state average at 25 percent, though turnover for entry -level Provider Investigator Is was much higher at 41 percent.133 134 Protective Services Intake Specialists There are approximately 20 protective services intake specialists with HHS Regulatory Services.135 136 Intake specialists answer calls and process complex inquiries, complaints, and incidents related to abuse, neglect, and exploitation involving Nursing Facilities, Assisted Living Facilities, Day Activity and Health Service s (DAHS), ICF/ID Facilities, Home Health and Hospice Agencies, Prescribed Pediatric Extended Care Center (PPECC) and Health Care Quality providers. Protective services intake specialists are about 41 years of age and have an average of eight years of state service. About 25 percent of intake specialists have less than two years of state service.137 Turnover for intake specialists is at the same rate as the state average turnover rate of 20 perc ent.138 139 HHS is currently experiencing difficulty filling vacant pr otective services intake specialist positions. Vacant positions are going unfilled, on average, for two months due to a shortage of qualified applicants available for work.140 Architects Within HHS, there are 17 Architect IIs who perform architectural plan r eviews and conduct initial and annual surveys and complaint/incident investigations on state licensure, and (when applicable) federal certification requirements for nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, Day Activity and Health Services facilities , F-33 Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities and in - patient Hospice facilities. 141 These HHS Architect IIs have, on average, 8 years of state service, with an average age of 58 years. Over 75 percent of these employees have f ive or more years of state service.142 HHS A rchitect II s earn an average annual salary of $ 63,647.143 The State Auditor's Office 2018 market index analysis found the average state salary for Architect IIs to be four percent behind the market rate.144 Though the turnover for these employees is curren tly well managed at 10 percent, with a vacancy rate of 26 percent, vacant positions often go unfilled for over nine months due to a shortage of qualified applicants available for work.145 146 Though only 12 percent of thes e employees are currently eligible to retire, over 40 percent will be eligible to retire in the next five years .147 HHS will need to develop creative recruitment strategies to replace these highly skilled employees . License and Permit Specialists There are 59 license and permit specialists within HHS. Over 90 percent of HHS license and permit specialists work in Regulatory Services, performing complex, journey -level, licensing and permitting work related to the licensing of mental health professionals .148 The typical HHS license and permit specialist is about 4 4 years of age and ha s an average of 1 2 years of state service. Nearly 50 percent of these employees have 10 or more years of state service.149 Turnover for these specialists is slig htly below the state ave rage at 19 percent .150 With a vacancy rate of about 1 2 percent, vacant positions often go unfilled for about four months due to a shortage of qualified applicants available for work.151 HHS license and permit specialist s earn an average annual salary of $ 40,918.152 The State Auditor's Office 2018 market index analysis found the average state salary for License and Permit Specialist Is to be four percent behind the market rate.153 This disparity may be affecting HHS' ability to recruit qualified applicants for open positions. Recruitment of these employees is an ongoing challenge. Quality Assurance Specialists There are 21 Quality Assurance Specialist IIIs and IVs employed within the HHSC Regulatory division . These specialists p rovide technical guidance and assistan ce to field staff , document quality assurance reviews and communicate those findings to appropriate program staff . They are responsible for a nalyzing quality assurance findings and performance data to identify trends or patterns and c oordinat ing case readings and other quality assurance and developmental activities .154 F-34 These specialists are, on average, about 41 years of age and have an average of 10 years of state service. Over 40 percent of these employees have 10 or more years of state service.155 156 Turnover for these specialists is slig htly below the state average at 17 percent .157 With a vacancy rate of about 13 percent, vacant positions often go unfilled for over 10 months due to a shortage of qualified applicants available for work.158 These quality assuranc e specialists earn an average annual salary of $50,119. T he State Auditor's Office 2018 market index analysis found the average state salary for Quality Assurance Specialist IIIs and IVs to be 11 percent behind the market rate.159 This disparity may be affec ting HHS' ability to recruit qualified applicants for open positions. Recruitment of these employees is an ongoing challenge. Social Workers There are 212 social workers employed by HHS, with the majority ( 68 percent) housed in state hospitals across the s tate.160 Turnover for these social workers is high at 27 percent.161 One reason for this high turnover is the large disparity between private sector and HHS salaries. System social workers earn an average annual salary of $ 44,491 .162 This salary falls significan tly below the market rate. The State Auditor's Office 201 8 market index analysis found the average state salary for Social Worker Is, IIs, and IIIs ranged from two to eight percent behind the market rate . In addition, the average annual salary for social w orkers nationally is $59,300 and $58,430 in Texas .163 164 These problems are expected to worsen as employees approach retirement. While 12 percent of these employees are currently eligible to retire, this number increases to about 23 percent in the next five y ears.165 Social Workers at State Supported Living Centers About 1 7 percent of HHS social workers (3 6 employees) work at state supported living centers across the state.166 These employees serve as a liaison between the resident's legally authorized representat ive and others to assure ongoing care, treatment and support through the use of person -centered practices. They gather information to assess a resident's support systems and service needs, support the assessment of the resident's rights and capacity to mak e decisions, and assist with the coordination of admissions, transfers, transitions and discharges. The typical social worker at these facilities is about 48 years old and has an average of 11 years of state service.167 The average turnover rate for these so cial workers is higher than the state average of 20 percent (at 27 percent), with positions often remaining unfilled for an average of over six months before being filled .168 169 F-35 Social Workers at State Hospitals There are 1 45 social workers at HHS state hospi tals.170 These employees are critical to managing patient flow in state hospitals and taking the lead role in communicating with patient families and community resources. Social workers provide essential functions within state hospitals that include conducti ng psychosocial assessments, therapeutic treatment and case coordination for individuals receiving services from HHS in -patient psychiatric hospitals and the Waco Center for Youth. State hospital social workers are about 4 3 years old and have an average of nine years of state service.171 The overall turnover rate for these social workers is high at around 2 9 percent, with the Austin State Hospital experiencing turnover of more than 50 percent.172 Public Health Social Workers About 15 percent of HHS social worke rs (31 employees) work in Public Health Regions across the state .173 These employees provide case management consultation for families with children who have health risks, conditions or special health care needs. The typical public health social worker is ab out 46 years old and has an average of 10 years of state service.174 The average turnover rate for these social workers is current ly well managed at nine percent .175 With a high vacancy rate of 28 percent, and with nearly 30 percent of these employees being el igible for retirement within the next five years, recruitment and retention of these workers remains a challenge.176 Registered Therapists at State Supported Living Centers HHS employs 294 registered therapists in state supported living centers across Texas.177 These therapists are employed in a variety of specializations, including speech -language pathologists, audiologists, occupational therapists and physical therapists. Full staffing of these positions is critical to direct -care services. These highly skill ed employees have, on average, about nine years of state service, with an average age of 46.178 Though turnover for these registered therapists is below the state average at 12 percent, HHS is experiencing difficulty filling vacant positions. Positions at th e Mexia State Supported Living Center remain unfilled for nearly nine months.179 180 HHS may face significant recruitment challenges in the next few years to replace these highly skilled employees who will be eligible for retirement. About eight F-36 percent of th ese employees are currently eligible to retire, and approximately 22 percent of them will be eligible in the next five years.181 HHS will need to develop creative recruitment strategies to replace these highly skilled and tenured employees. Registered Nurse s (RNs) RNs constitute one of the largest healthcare occupations. With over three million jobs in the U.S., job opportunities for RNs are expected to grow faster than the average for all occupations. It is projected that there will be a need for 371,500 new RN jobs by 2028. 182 183 HHS employs approximately 2,139 RNs across the state.184 185 As the demand for nursing services increases, the recruitment and retention of nurses will continue to be a challenge, and the need for competitive salaries will be critical. Currently, the average annual salary for HHS System RNs is $61,669 .186 This salary falls below both national and state averages for these occupations. Nationally, the average annual earnings for RNs in 201 9 was $ 77,460 .187 In Texas, the average annual earnings f or RNs in 201 9 was $ 74,540 .188 In addition, the State Auditor's Office 201 8 market index analysis found the average state salary for Nurse I -IVs ranged from five to 14 percent behind the market rate and 10 percent behind the market rate for Public Health Nur se IIs.189 Posted vacant positions are currently taking about six months to fill.190 RNs at State Supported Living Centers About 31 percent of System RNs (672 RNs) work at HHS state supported living centers across Texas. 191 The typical state supported living cen ter RN is about 47 years old and has an average of approximately eight years of state service.192 The turnover rate for these RNs is considered high at about 2 1 percent. Turnover is especially high at the El Paso State Supported Living Center (at approximate ly 48 percent) and the San Antonio State Supported Living Center (at about 33 percent).193 In addition, HHS finds it difficult to fill these vacant nurse positions. With a vacancy rate of approximately 14 percent , RN positions often remain open for more than six months before being filled. Some facilities are experiencing even longer vacancy durations. At the Denton, Lubbock, and San Angelo state supported living centers , it takes about 10 months to fill a vacancy .194 RNs at State Hospitals About 38 percent of System RNs (806 RNs) work at state hospitals across the Texas, providing frontline medical care of patients. They provide medications, primary health care and oversee psychiatric treatment. 195 F-37 System nurses at state hospitals are generally required to work s hifts and weekends. The work is demanding, requires special skills and staff often work long hours with minimal staffing. The work is also physically demanding, making it increasingly more difficult for the aging nursing workforce to keep up with these work demands. All of these job factors contribute to higher than average turnover rates. Turnover for these RNs is considered high at about 2 4 percent. Turnover is at nearly 30 percent at the El Paso Psychiatric Center , the San Antonio State Hospital, and the Terrell State Hospital .196 The typical RN at a System state hospital is about 48 years old and has an average of approximately nine years of state service.197 At these state hospitals, there are always vacant nursing positions that need to be filled. These RN positions often remain open for about five months before being filled. Some hospitals are experiencing longer vacancy durations. At the Big Spring State Hospital and the Waco Center for Youth , it takes over seven months to fill a position.198 Public Health RNs About five percent of System RNs (110 RNs) provide direct care and population - based services in the many counties in Texas that have no local health department, or where state support is needed.199 These RNs are often the individuals who are on the front line in the delivery of public health services to rural communities throughout the state, serving as consultants and advisors to county, local and stakeholder groups, and educating community partners. They assist in communicable disease investigation, cont rol and prevention, and are critical to successful public health preparedness and response throughout the state. Public Health RNs have, on average, about seven years of state service, with an average age of about 49 years.200 Overall turnover for these RNs is high ( about 28 percent ). Certain areas of Texas experienced higher turnover than others, including those in Public Health Region 1 (Lubbock area) and Public Health Region 2/3 (Arlington area) - both at about 27 percent.201 Nurse Surveyors There are 208 RN s employed as nurse surveyors (approximately 10 percent of System RNs).202 These RNs utilize their expertise to conduct surveys and complaint/incident investigations on state licensure and when applicable, federal certification requirements for nursing facil ities, assisted living facilities, Day Activity and Health Services facilities, Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities and in -patient Hospice facilities . In addition to being licensed to practice as an RN by the Texas B oard of Nurse Examiners, Long Term Care nurse surveyors must also obtain the Surveyor Minimum Qualification (SMQT) certification with the first year of employment. The F-38 typical nurse surveyor is about 51 years old with approximately six years of state service.203 The turnover rate is considered high at about 22 percent, and it typically takes about five months to fill a vacant position. Recruitment and retention of these RNs remains difficult due to salary constraints. Approximately 19 percent of these highly skilled employees will be eligible to retire from state employment in the next five years.204 205 Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs) There are 1001 LVNs employed by HHS.206 The majority of these employees (about 97 percent) work at state hospitals and state suppo rted living centers across Texas .207 About three percent work in Public Health Regions and central office program support, assisting in communicable disease prevention and control and the delivery of population -based services to individuals, families, and co mmunities. On average, a System LVN is 4 6 years old and has eight years of state service.208 As with RNs, the nursing shortage is also impacting the HHS' ability to attract and retain LVNs. Turnover for LVNs is currently very high at about 31 percent.209 Curre ntly, the average annual salary for System LVNs during fiscal year 201 9 was $41,257 .210 This salary falls below both national and state averages for this occupation. Nationally, the average annual earnings for licensed practical nurses and LVNs is $4 8,500 , and $4 7,370 in Texas.211 The State Auditor's Office 2018 market index analysis found the average state salary for LVN IIs and IIIs were 15 percent behind the market rate.212 Recruitment and retention of these highly skilled employees remains a significant challenge. LVNs at State Supported Living Centers There are 5 29 LVNs employed at HHS state supported living centers across Texas . These LVNs are, on average, 4 6 years old and have an average of approximately eight years of state service.213 Turnover for LVNs at s tate supported living centers is at about 3 3 percent. The state supported living centers experienced the loss of 1 92 LVNs in fiscal year 201 9. Turnover is extremely high at the El Paso State Supported Living Center (at 72 percent) and the San Angelo State Supported Living Center (at 53 percent).214 With a very high vacancy rate of about 2 8 percent, vacant positions often go unfilled for over six months. Some centers are experiencing even longer vacancy durations. At the Denton, Corpus Christi, and San Angelo state supported living centers it takes about nine months to fill a position.215 F-39 LVNs at State Hospitals There are approximately 4 42 LVNs employed at HHS state hospitals and centers across Texas .216 On average, a state hospital LVN is about 4 5 years old and ha s eight years of state service.217 Turnover for these LVNs is high at about 28 percent. Turnover is especially high at Rusk State Hospital (at 43 percent) and the San Antonio State Hospital (at 34 percent).218 State hospitals continue to experience difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified staff which can be attributed to a shortage in the qualified labor pool . Market competition and budget limitations significantly constrain the ability of state hospitals to compete for available talent. LVNs in Public Health Roles About two percent of System LVNs ( 25 LVNs) work in the Public Health Regions across Texas. They have , on average, about 1 1 years of state service, with an average age of about 51 years.219 The overall turnover for these LVNs is high at 18 percen t.220 Retention is expected to remain an issue as employment of LVNs is projected to grow 11 percent by the year 2028, faster than the average for all occupations and budgetary limitations will continue to make it difficult for the System to offer competitiv e salaries.221 Nurse Practitioners HHS employs 70 nurse practitioners throughout the System. 222 Under the supervision of a physician, 68 of these nurse practitioners are responsible for providing advanced medical services and clinical care to individuals at st ate hospitals and those who reside in state supported living centers across Texas. 223 These highly skilled employees have, on average, about 9 years of state service, with an average age of 50. Approximately 40 percent of these employees have 10 years or mor e of state service.224 System nurse practitioners earn an average annual salary of $ 112,090 .225 This salary falls slightly below the market rate. The State Auditor's Office 2018 market index analysis found the average state salary for nurse practitioners was a bout nine percent behind the market rate.226 The turnover rate for nurse practitioners is about 17 percent, and the vacancy rate is approximately nine percent, with positions remaining vacant for an average of about six months.227 228 About 11 percent of nurse p ractitioners are currently eligible to retire, with this number increasing to 23 percent in the next five years.229 HHS will need to develop F-40 creative recruitment strategies to replace these highly skilled and tenured employees. Nurs e Practitioners at State S upported Living Centers HHS employs 26 nurse practitioners at state supported living centers across Texas. 230 These highly skilled employees have, on average, about seven years of state service, with an average age of 50. 231 The overall turnover rate for these nurse practitioners is high at about 29 percent.232 Although the vacancy rate is only about seven percent, vacant positions at state supported living centers typically remain unfilled for about seven months. 233 Due to the continuing short supply and high dema nd for these professionals, HHS will need to continue using creative recruitment strategies to replace these employees. Nurse Practitioners at State Hospitals HHS employs 42 nurse practitioners at state hospitals across Texas. These highly skilled employee s have, on average, about 11 years of state service, with an average age of 49.234 Though turnover for these state hospital employees is currently low at about 10 percent, positions are often remaining unfilled for months .235 236 About 12 percent of these highly skilled employees are currently eligible to retire. This number will increase to approximately 24 percent retirement eligibility in the next five years.237 Dentists at State Supported Living Centers The demand for dentists nationwide is expected to increase as the overall population ages. Employment of dentists is projected to grow by seven percent through 2028.238 The System employs a total of 30 dentists across the state.239 Of the 30 dentists employed by the System, over half (5 7 percent) provide advanced den tal care and treatment for residents living at the HHS supported living centers across Texas. The typical dentist at these facilities is about 5 3 years old and has an average of 10 years of state service.240 Facility dentists earn an average salary of $ 145,6 56, which is below the average wage paid nationally ( $178,260), and also lower than the Texas average of $183,510.241 242 Turnover for these dentists is high at about 17 percent.243 State supported living centers face challenges competing with private sector sal aries to fill current vacancies. F-41 It is anticipated that HHS will face significant recruitment challenges in the next few years to replace these highly skilled employees who will be eligible for retirement. About 12 percent of these employees are currently eligible to retire, and this number will increase to about 29 percent in the next five years.244 Physicians There are currently about 390,680 active physicians and surgeons across the country.245 Due to the increased demand for healthcare services by the growi ng and aging population, employment of physicians is projected to grow about seven percent by 2028 , faster than the average for all occupations.246 HHS employs 8 3 physicians, with majority ( 84 percent) employed in HHS state supported living centers, state h ospitals and in Public Health Regions.247 These highly skilled employees have, on average, about nine years of state service, with an average age of 56. Over 3 1 percent of these employees have more than 10 years or more of state service.248 System physicians a re currently earning an average annual salary of $18 5,492.249 This salary is below the average wage paid nationally ($203,450) and also lower than the Texas average of $200,590 .250 The State Auditor's Office 2018 market index analysis found the average state s alary for Physician s to be five to 10 percent behind the market rate.251 Turnover for these physicians is at 22 percent.252 In addition, the vacancy rate is at 13 percent, with positions remaining vacant for an average of about eight months.253 About 18 percent of these highly skilled and tenured employees are currently eligible to retire, with this number increasing to 34 percent in the next five years.254 Physicians at State Supported Living Centers There are 34 physicians working at state supported living center s across Texas.255 Full staffing of these positions is critical to direct -care services. These physicians have, on average, about nine years of state service, with an average age of 57.256 Local physicians who have established long term private practices often apply as a staff physician at state supported living centers late in their working career to secure retirement and insurance benefits, thus contributing to the reason for the high average age. Turnover for these physicians is high at 26 percent.257 To deal with recruitment and retention difficulties, HHS has often used contract physicians to provide required coverage. These contracted physicians are paid at rates that are well above the amount it would cost to hire physicians at state salaries. Aside from be ing more costly, the System has experienced other problems with contracted physicians, including a lengthy learning curve, difficulty in obtaining F-42 long-term commitments, difficulty in obtaining coverage, dependability and consistent services levels due to their short -term commitment. To meet the health needs of individuals residing in state supported living centers, it is critical that HHS recruit and retain qualified physicians. However, due to the short supply and large demand, state supported living cent ers are experiencing difficulty hiring physicians. With a high vacancy rate of 17 percent, positions are remaining unfilled for an average of almost 10 months.258 Physicians at State Hospitals There are currently 28 physicians at HHS who are providing essent ial medical care in state hospitals.259 They take the lead role in diagnosing, determining a course of treatment, making referrals to outside medical hospitals, prescribing medications and monitoring the patients' progress toward discharge. Physician service s in state hospitals are essential to the ongoing monitoring and management of an increasing number of complex chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, seizure disorders, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These employees are critical to the System's preparedness and response to medical services provided by the state and to major public health initiatives, such as obesity prevention, diabetes, disease outbreak control and others. These physicians have, on average, about 1 1 years of state service, with an average age of about 5 6. Local physicians who have established long term private practices often apply as physicians at state hospitals late in their working career to secure retirement and insurance benefits, contributing to the high overall age. Only nine full-time physicians are under 50 years of age.260 Turnover for these physicians is about 17 percent.261 With a vacancy rate of about 13 percent, it takes about seven and a half months to fill a state hospital physician positio n with someone who has appropriate skills and expertise.262 In addition, HHS may face significant challenges in the next few years to replace those employees who are eligible for retirement. About 18 percent of these highly skilled and tenured employees are currently eligible to retire. Within five years, about 36 percent will be eligible to retire.263 If these employees choose to retire, HHS would lose some of the most experienced medical personnel - those with institutional knowledge and skills that will be d ifficult to match and even harder to recruit. Recruitment of qualified candidates, as well as retention of these highly skilled and knowledgeable employees, continues to be a challenge for the System. Physicians in Public Health Roles There are eight HHS p hysicians performing public health services.264 Physicians serving in public health roles in Public Health Regions and Central Office act as state and regional consultants and advisors to county, local, hospital, and stakeholder groups, and provide subject m atter expertise on programs and services. These F-43 physicians provide public health services that are essential to the provision of direct clinical services in areas of the state where local jurisdictions do not provide services in communicable disease contro l and prevention and population -based services. Physicians serving in Public Health Regions initiate treatment of communicable diseases; refer, prescribe medication, and monitor treatment. They oversee infectious disease investigation, control, and prevent ion efforts regionally, and provide direction for public health preparedness and response centrally and in the Public Health Regions. Some of the physicians who serve as Regional Directors are required by statute to also serve as the Local Health Authority (LHA) in counties that do not have a designated LHA. As such, they enforce laws relating to public health; establish, maintain and enforce quarantines; and report the presence of contagious, infectious, and dangerous epidemic diseases in the health author ity's jurisdiction. As Regional Medical Directors, physicians in Public Health Regions serve as community leaders and conveyors of health -related organizations and individuals for the purpose of improving the health of all Texans. These physicians are, on average, about 5 1 years old, with an average of about nine years of state service.265 Turnover for these positions is high at about 24 percent.266 While only 13 percent of these physicians are eligible to retire, a quarter of these highly skilled employees are expected to retire in the next five years .267 HHS will need to develop creative recruitment strategies to replace these highly skilled employees . Psychiatrists There are currently about 28,600 psychiatrists nationwide. Increased demand for healthcare servic es by the growing and aging population is expected to result in a 1.2 percent rate of growth in the state government sector by 2028.268 HHS employs 120 psychiatrists throughout the System, with the majority of these psychiatrists (about 83 percent) employed in state hospitals across Texas.269 These highly skilled and tenured employees have, on average, about 12 years of state service, with an average age of 5 4.270 System psychiatrists currently earn an average annual salary of $226,900.271 The State Auditor's Offic e 2018 market index analysis found the average state salary for Psychiatrist IIIs to be 10 percent behind the market rate.272 Turnover for System psychiatrists is currently at about 19 percent.273 The vacancy rate is high at about 1 8 percent, with positions re maining vacant for an average of about eight months.274 About 2 3 percent of these highly skilled and tenured employees are currently eligible to retire, with this number increasing to 43 percent in the next five years.275 F-44 Psychiatrists at State Supported Livin g Centers There are 13 Psychiatrist IIIs assigned to state supported living centers.276 Full staffing of these positions is critical to providing psychiatric services needed by residents. These Psychiatrists IIIs have, on average, about six years of state se rvice, with an average age of 53.277 With a high vacancy rate of 24 percent, vacant positions in state supported living centers go unfilled for about nine months (Brenham State Supported Living Center has a very high vacancy rate of 67 percent and positions go unfilled for almost a year).278 Competing with private sector salaries and an overall shortage of psychiatrists in Texas continue to make it difficult to recruit and retain qualified individuals. To maintain required coverage, HHS has used contracted psyc hiatrists . These psychiatrists are paid well above the amount it would cost to hire psychiatrists at state salaries (costing in excess of $200 per hour, compared to the hourly rate of about $10 9 paid to agency psychiatrists ).279 To meet the health needs of i ndividuals residing in state supported living centers, it is critical that HHS fill all budgeted psychiatrist positions and effectively recruit and retain qualified psychiatrists. Psychiatrists at State Hospitals There are currently 91 System psychiatrists providing essential medical and psychiatric care in state hospitals.280 These highly skilled employees take the lead role in diagnosing, determining a course of treatment, prescribing medications and monitoring patient progress. Recruiting and retaining psy chiatrists at the state hospitals has been especially difficult for HHS. These psychiatrists have, on average, about 13 years of state service, with an average age of 54. About 5 0 percent of these employees have 10 or more years of service.281 Annual turnove r for these psychiatrists is about 1 8 percent. Terrell State Hospital reported the highest state hospital turnover rate of about 35 percent.282 With an overall high vacancy rate of about 20 percent, most vacant psychiatrist positions go unfilled for months.283 At some state hospitals, these positions remain vacant for over nine months (at the El Paso Psychiatric Center and Rusk State Hospital). These challenges are expected to continue, as about 24 percent of these highly skilled and tenured employees are curre ntly eligible to retire and may leave at any time. Within five years, this number will increase to 44 percent.284 State hospitals continue to face increasing difficulty in recruiting qualified psychiatrists as salaries are not competitive with the private se ctor, and there is a general shortage of a qualified labor pool . F-45 Due to the complex medical and mental challenges that individuals residing in state hospitals exhibit, it is critical that HHS is able to effectively recruit and retain qualified psychiatrist s. Continued targeted recruitment strategies and retention initiatives for these highly skilled professionals must be ongoing. Psychologists There are 2 33 psychologists in HHS, with the majority (97 percent ) employed in state supported living centers and s tate hospitals across the state.285 System psychologists earn an average annual salary of $5 7,463 .286 This salary falls below the market rate. The State Auditor's Office 2018 market index analysis found the average state salary for Psychologist Is to be 11 percent behind the market rate and Psychologist IIIs to be eight percent behind the market rate .287 Turnover for these psychologists is high at 2 8 percent, with psychologist positions often remaining unfilled for several months before being filled .288 289 Psycholog ists at State Supported Living Centers About 7 9 percent of HHS psychologists (1 81 employees) work at state supported living centers across Texas.290 These employees participate in quality assurance and quality enhancement activities related to the provision of psychological and behavioral services to state supported living center residents; provide consultation and technical assistance to individuals with cognitive, developmental, physical and health related needs; implement and evaluate behavioral support pl ans; review the use of psychotropic medication in treating behavior problems; perform chart reviews; and perform observations and assessments relevant to the design of positive interventions and supports for residents . The typical psychologist at these fac ilities is about 42 years old and has an average of eight years of state service.291 Turnover for these psychologists is high at about 31 percent, reflecting the loss of about 5 9 workers during fiscal year 201 9. Turnover rates by location ranged from 0 perce nt at the San Antonio State Supported Living Center to 100 percent at the Corpus Christi State Supported Living Center.292 With a high vacancy rate for these positions (at approximately 1 6 percent), psychologist positions often remain open for months before being filled. At the Denton State Supported Living Center, positions have remained vacant for an average of 11 months.293 Psychologists at State Hospitals There are 4 6 psychologists working at HHS state hospitals, with about 6 7 percent employed in Psychologi st II positions.294 Full staffing of these positions is critical to providing needed psychological services to patients. State hospital psychologists play a key role in the development of treatment programs for both individual patients and groups of patients . Their evaluations are F-46 critical to the ongoing management and discharge of patients receiving competency restoration services, an ever -growing patient population in the state hospitals. They also provide testing and evaluation services important to ongoin g treatment, such as the administration of IQ, mood, and neurological testing instruments. These highly skilled and tenured employees have, on average, about 1 1 years of state service, with an average age of 4 9.295 Turnover for these psychologists is high ab out 17 percent. Rio Grande State Center experienced the highest turnover at 67 percent.296 The vacancy rate for these positions is about eight percent, with positions often remaining unfilled for over five months .297 HHS may face significant recruitment challe nges in the next few years, as approximately 30 percent of these highly skilled and tenured employees will be eligible for retirement in the next five years .298 It is critical that HHS fill s all budgeted state hospital psychologist positions and effectively recruit and retain qualified psychologists. Epidemiologists HHS employs 103 epidemiologists who provide services in the areas of infectious disease and injury control, chronic disease control, emergency and disaster preparedness, disease surveillance and o ther public health areas.299 They provide critical functions during disasters and pandemics and other preparedness and response planning. As of May 201 8, there were approximately 7,600 epidemiologist jobs in the U.S., with a projected job growth rate of 5.3 percent by 202 8.300 On average, System epidemiologists have about seven years of state service, with an average age of approximately 3 6 years.301 Turnover for System epidemiologists is currently at about 17 percent. This rate is much higher for entry -level Epi demiologist Is, at about 26 percent.302 Low pay is a contributing factor in the inability to attract qualified epidemiologist applicants. System epidemiologists are currently earning an average annual salary of $59, 723.303 This salary is significantly below th e average wage paid nationally ($78,290), and also lower than the Texas average of $65,610.304 In addition, the State Auditor's Office 2018 market index analysis found that the average state salary for epidemiologists to be nine percent behind the market rat e.305 Currently, only about eight percent of these employees are currently eligible to retire, this rate will increase in the next five years to 1 1 percent. Fourteen percent of senior -level epidemiologists (Epidemiologist III's) are currently eligible to ret ire. In about five years, 18 percent will be eligible to retire.306 HHS will need to closely monitor this occupation due to the nationally non - competitive salaries and a general shortage of professionals performing this work. F-47 Sanitarians There are 117 sanita rians employed with HHS.307 HHS reg istered sanitarians inspect all dairies, milk plants, food and drug manufacturers, wholesale food distributors, food and drug salvagers in Texas, as well as all retail establishments in the 188 counties not covered by local health jurisdictions and conduct a multitude of environmental inspections such as children's camps and many others. Sanitarians are instrumental in protecting the citizens of Texas from food -borne illness and many dangerous environmental situations and co nsumer products, including imported foods, drugs and consumer products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) have little manpower and therefore depend on the state programs to protect citizens. System sanitarians also respond to a variety of emergencies, including truck wrecks, fires, tornados, floods and hurricanes. They are the first line of defense against a bioterrorist attack on the food supply. On average, HHS sanitarians are 45 years old and h ave about 11 years of state service. About 39 percent of these employees have 10 or more years of state service.308 Though the turnover rate for HHS sanitarians is currently low at about 10 percent, HHS has experienced difficulty filling vacant positions, with vacant positions often going unfilled for many months due to a shortage of qualified applicants available for work. Turnover for Sanitarians III was higher at almost 21 percent, with vacancies in this classification going unfilled for six months.309 310 Historically, HHS has faced special challenges filling vacancies in both rural and urban areas of the state. In addition, the state requirement for sanitarians to be registered and have at least 30 semester hours of science (in addition to 18 hours of continu ing education units every two years ) has made it increasingly difficult to find qualified individuals. With 15 percent of sanitarians currently eligible to retire, and 27 percent eligible to retire in the next five years, HHS will need to develop creative recruitment strategies to replace these skilled and highly tenured employees.311 Veterinarians There are 17 Veterinarians working for DSHS in the Consumer Protection Division, the Division for Laboratory and Infectious Disease Services, and in Public Health Regions across the state.312 System Veterinarians perform advanced veterinary work and are responsible for the day -to-day management of the Zoonosis Control (ZC) Program. These highly -skilled and tenured employees have, on average, about 13 years of state se rvice, with an average age of 52.313 System Veterinarians make $89,739.6, which is below the national ($104,820) and state ( $125,28 0) average salaries.314 In addition, the State Auditor's Office 2018 F-48 market index analysis found that the average state salary fo r Veterinarian IIs to be eight percent behind the market rate.315 Turnover for Veterinarians is slightly below the state average at 16 percent. Turnover for Veterinarian II's is higher than that of Veterinarian III's, at 18 percent.316 317 The agency may face si gnificant recruitment challenges in the next few years to replace these highly -skilled and tenured employees who are eligible for retirement. Currently, 29 percent of Veterinarians are eligible to retire, and over 50 percent of these employees will be elig ible to retire in the next five years.318 Special efforts should be made to recruit these professional to avoid a critical shortage in the near future. Health Physicists Within HHS, there are 6 3 health physicists, all employed within the Consumer Protection Division .319 These employees p lan and conduct complex and highly advanced technical inspections and license application review of radioactive material, nuclear medicine, industrial x -ray units, general medical diagnostic x -ray units, fluoroscopic units, mam mographic units, C -Arm units, radiation therapy equipment, laser equipment, and industrial and medical radioactive materials to assure user's compliance with applicable State and Federal regulations. Health pysicists are instrumental in emergency planning for the offsite response of nuclear power plants and are the the first line of defense for radiological disaster response . HHS health physicists have, on average, 13 years of state service, with an average age of 5 0 years. Over 50 percent of these employee s have 10 or more years of state service.320 HHS health physicists earn an average annual salary of $ 59,238, which is below the average wage paid nationally ($76,290 ), and also lower than the Texas average of $75,720 .321 322 Though the turnover for health physic ists is currently well managed at 14 percent , vacant positions often go unfilled for many months due to a shortage of qualified applicants available for work.323 324 With 30 percent of health physicists at HHS currently eligible to retire, and about 44 percent eligible to retire in the next five years, HHS will need to develop creative recruitment strategies to replace these highly skilled and tenured employees.325 Public Health and Prevention Specialists Within HHS, there are 3 22 public health and prevention spe cialists, with the majority of these employees (9 0 percent) employed at DSHS.326 These employees provide technical consultation to local health departments, human and animal health care professionals, government officials, community action groups, and others on a number of public health areas, including the treatment, F-49 prevention and control of zoonotic diseases, rabies risk assessment, and animal control; providing population -based services toward improving access to care for children and pregnant women, prom oting breastfeeding, increasing parent - completed developmental screenings, reducing feto -infant mortality and preventing child fatalities; and providing technical assistance and instruction in cancer reporting methods. HHS public health and prevention spec ialists have, on average, 11 years of state service, with an average age of 46 years. Forty-five percent of these employees have 10 or more years of state service.327 While overall turnover for public health and prevention specialists at 1 9 percent is slight ly below the state average rate of 20 percent, certain areas within HHS are experiencing significantly higher turnover rates, including Public Health Region 9/10 in the El Paso area (at 2 8 percent), the Public Health Region 8 in the San Antonio area (at 28 percent) , and Public Health Region 4/5 in the Tyler area (at 23 percent).328 329 In addition, HHS finds it difficult to fill these vacant public health and prevention specialist positions. With a high vacancy rate for these positions (at approximately 15 percent), these positions often remain open for more than four months before being filled.330 Retention is expected to remain an issue as these employees approach retirement. Nineteen percent of public health and prevention specialists are currently eligible to retire, and about 33 percent will be eligible to retire in the next five years.331 Medical Technicians Within HHS, there are 2 4 medical technicians.332 These workers assist nursing staff with age appropriate patient care, which includes providing patients pers onal hygiene; making beds and assisting with preparation of unit 's and patient 's rooms for receiving new patients; taking vital signs; obtaining specimens; cleaning patient care equipment; and transporting patients to and from various departments. Over hal f of these medical technicians are employed at the Texas Center of Infectious Disease (TCID), with the remaining technicians employed at HHS state hospitals and state supported living centers across Texas. System medical technicians have, on average, about 11 years of state service, with an average age of 50 years. About 33 percent of these employees have 10 or more years of state service.333 The turnover rate for all System medical technicians is currently well managed at nine percent. This rate is higher fo r entry -level Medical Technician Is at TCID (at 14 percent).334 The vacancy rate for System medical technicians is currently low at about four percent, though vacant positions often remain unfilled for about a year.335 F-50 HHS medical technicians earn an average a nnual salary of $2 8,064 .336 The State Auditor's Office 201 8 market index analysis found the average state salary for medical technicians ranged from five to 10 percent behind the market rate.337 This disparity may be affecting HHS' ability to recruit qualified applicants for open positions. About 17 percent of these employees are currently eligible to retire, with nearly 30 of these employees eligible in the next five years. HHS will need to develop creative recruitment strategies to replace these employees, an d to ensure a qualified applicant pool is available to select from as vacancies occur.338 Laboratory Staff HHS operates a state -of-the-art state laboratory in Austin and two regional laboratories, one in San Antonio and the other in Harlingen. The Austin Sta te Hospital provides laboratory services for the other HHS state hospitals and state suppor ted living centers. While laboratory staff is made up of a number of highly skilled employees, there are four job groups that are essential to laboratory operations: chemists, microbiologists, laboratory technicians and medical technologists. Chemists There are 5 6 chemists employed in the HHS Division for Laboratory and Infectious Disease Services, all located in Austin.339 The typical System chemist is about 47 years o ld and has an average of about 13 years of state service. Nearly half of the employees have 10 years or more of state service.340 The overall turnover rate for System chemists is high, at 24 percent annually , which is above the state average turnover rate of 20 percent.341 342 Vacant System chemist positions often go unfilled for many months due to a shortage of qualified applicants available for work.343 These vacancy problems are expected to worsen as employees approach retirement. Nearly 2 1 percent of these tenured and highly skilled employees are currently eligible to retire.344 Low pay is a factor in the inability to attract qualified chemist applicants. System chemists earn an average annual salary of about $ 47,652 .345 The State Auditor's Office 201 8 market index analysis found the average state salary for chemists ranged from five to 11 percent behind the market rate.346 The average annual salary for chemists nationally is $84,150 and $89,520 in Texas.347 Microbiologists There are 13 8 microbiologists working for HHS, with the majority at the Austin laboratory.348 349 System microbiologists have, on average, about 1 0 years of state service, with an average age of about 4 0 years.350 F-51 The turnover rate for all System microbiologists is below the state average rate of 20 percent at about nine percent. This rate is much higher for tenured Microbiologist Vs (at 2 0 percent).351 352 System microbiologists earn an average annual salary of about $44, 378.353 The State Auditor's Office 201 8 market index analysis found the average state salary f or Microbiologist IIs was 12 percent behind the market rate and from six to eight percent behind the market rate for Molecular Biologists.354 This average annual salary also falls below the national and statewide market rates for this occupation. The average annual salary for microbiologists nationally is $82,760 and $55,030 in Texas.355 This disparity in earnings is affecting the System's ability to recruit qualified applicants for open positions. Microbiologist positions often remain unfilled for several mont hs.356 In addition, HHS may face significant recruitment challenges in the next few years to replace these highly skilled and tenured employees who are eligible for retirement. Though only 1 1 percent of these employees are currently eligible to retire, this rate will increase in the next five years to about 20 percent.357 Laboratory Technicians There are 42 laboratory technicians employed at HHS.358 The typical laboratory technician is about 4 3 years old and has an average of 1 1 years of state service.359 The turno ver rate for System laboratory technicians is very high, at about 32 percent .360 The vacancy rate for System laboratory technicians is currently high at about 19 percent (seven percent higher than reported in FY 2017) , with vacant positions often going unfil led for many months due to a shortage of qualified applicants available for work.361 Low pay is a factor in the inability to attract qualified laboratory technician applicants. HHS laboratory technicians earn an average annual salary of about $31,478 .362 The a verage annual salary for medical and clinical laboratory technicians nationally is $54,780 and $ 52,720 in Texas.363 The State Auditor's Office 201 8 market index analysis foun d the average state salary for Laboratory Technician Is to IVs ranged from three to 16 percent behind the market rate.364 These problems are expected to worsen as employees approach retirement. About 29 percent of these tenured and highly skilled employees will be eligible to retire in the next five years.365 Medical Technologists Within HHS, there are 66 medical technologists.366 These workers perform complex clinical laboratory work and are critical to providing efficient and quality healthcare. F-52 System medical technologists have, on average, about 10 years of state service, with an average age of 42 years. About 39 percent of these employees have 10 or more years of state service.367 The turnover rate for all System medical technologists is currently high at 21 percent.368 369 The vacancy rate for System medical technologists is currently high at about 12 percent, with vacant positions often going unfilled for many months due to a shortage of qualified applicants available for work.370 HHS medical technologists earn an average annual salary of $43, 033.371 The State Auditor's Office 201 8 market index analy sis found the average state salary for medical technologists ranged from six to 13 percent behind the market rate.372 This disparity is affecting HHS' ability to recruit qualified applicants for open positions. Though only nine percent of these employees are currently eligible to retire, over 20 percent of these employees will be eligible in the next five years.373 HHS will need to develop creative recruitment strategies to replace these highly skilled and tenured employees, and to ensure a qualified applicant pool is available to select from as vacancies occur.

Introduction This \" 2020 Report on Customer Service\" is prepared in response to \u00a72114.002 of the Government Code, which requires that Texas state agencies biennially submit information gathered from customers about the quality of agency services to the Governor's Office of Budget and Policy an d the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) . This report reflects the cooperative efforts of two Texas agencies belonging to the Texas Health and Human Services (HHS) system during the State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2018 and SFY 2019 reporting period: the Department of State Health Services (DSHS) and the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). HHS S ystem Mission and Budget Strategies The HHS system mission is \" Improving the health, safety, and well -being of Texans with good stewardship of public resources. \" The HHS System Strategic Plan 201 9- 2023 articulates specific goals and action plans for achieving the system mission, and includes a list of related budget strategies consistent with the HHS budget structure.1 Two appendices to this report present a description of services provided to customers from each agency by strategic plan budget strategy.2 In pursuit of the system mission and accompanying budget strategies , HHS agencies administer a range of surveys to assess the quality of HHS services and promote continuous improvement. This report presents the results of those surveys. Previous Reports on Customer Service In 2006 and 2008, HHS agencies worked collaboratively to develop a system -wide survey to assess the satisfaction of customers of each HHS agency. These surveys were comparable and included a unique group of enrollees identified by each agency. The survey questionnaire included questions about service access and choice, staff knowledge, staff courtesy, complaint handling, quality of information and communications, and internet use. 1 See HHS System Strategic Plan 20 19-2023, Volume II, Schedule A. 2 See Appendix A and Appendix B of this document for Customer Inventories by Agency. This information is presented in accordance with Chap ter 2114 .002(a) of the Government Code. 5 For the 2010 HHS system customer satisfaction survey, a different approach was taken. HHS agencies collaborated on a system -wide survey of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) enrolled in each HHS agency. At the time, the five existing HHS agencies served CSHCN customers through a variety of programs. From 2012 to 2016, no system -wide survey was conducted. HHS agencies independently conducted surveys that included questions about customer satisfaction with specific agency programs and services and each agency provided the results of those independent surve ys. Some surveys focused entirely on customer satisfaction while others included customer satisfaction as one of several service categories being assessed. The 2018 report took a similar approach to the reports produced since 2012, with each HHS agency providing the results of customer surveys for their particular programs. Because many of the surveys were conducted prior to HHS system reorganization, the 2018 report was structured to reflect both the current and legacy location of each survey. The overall format of the report reflected the three HHS agencies in operation at the time \u2014the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) , DSHS, and HHSC. The 2020 report includes the results of customer surveys administered by programs in DSHS and HHSC, reflecting the current HHS system organization. The DFPS, which became a standalone agency at the direction of House Bill 5, 85th Legislature, Regular Sessi on, 2017, will submit its own Report on Customer Service. Surveys Included in 2020 Report on Customer Service The surveys included in the 2020 Report on Customer Service are briefly described in the pages that follow (Tables 1 and 2). For the most part, surveys were administered during SFY 2018 and SFY 2019 (Sept 2017 -Aug 2019 ), though data collection for some surveys fell slightly outside of this period. There were 289,132 individual responses to the 31 surveys reported here. 6 Table 1: Department of State Health Services Surveys Program Area Name Data Collection N (Response Rate1) Survey Population Community Health Improvement Children with Special Health Care Needs Systems Development Group Case Management and Family Supports and Community Resources Family Satisfaction Surveys 09/01/2017 - 08/31/2018 09/01/2018- 08/31/2019 887 (21%) 299 (5%) Families of children and youth with special health care needs who received services from contracted providers Consumer Protection Division Business Filing and Verification Section - Customer Service Satisfaction Survey 09/01/2017 - 08/31/2018 09/01/2018- 08/31/2019 156 131 Customers of the Regulatory Licensing Unit (businesses and facilities regulated by the state) Consumer Protection Division Surveillance Section Customer Service Satisfaction Survey 09/01/2017 - 08/31/2019 109 Regulated entities that interact with Surveillance Section staff Laboratory and Infectious Disease Texas Vaccines for Children (TVFC) Program - Clinic Site Visits 2018 897 (31%) Healthcare providers who order and administer vaccines to TVFC -eligible children and received a site visit during the contract year Laboratory and Infectious Disease Laboratory Services Testing Customer Satisfaction Survey 02/27/2019 - 03/25/2019 174 (69%) Facilities that receive services from the Laboratory Services Section Laboratory and Infectious Disease Laboratory Courier Program Satisfaction Survey 08/15/2019 - 09/01/2019 123 (12%) Healthcare facility customers of the Laboratory Services Courier Program Laboratory and Infectious Disease South Texas Laboratory - Water Sample Testing 01/10/2019 - 02/12/2018 26 (33%) Submitters of water samples to the South Texas Laboratory Laboratory and Infectious Disease South Texas Laboratory - Clinical Testing 01/2019 - 02/2019 26 (24%) Regional Clinics and TB Elimination Submitters to South Texas Laboratory Total n/a n/a 2,776 (17%)2 n/a 1 Response rate calculated for surveys with equivalent methodology.

Updates Resulting from HB 2110 (86th Legislature, Regular Session) HHS Online Survey Software and Administration In 2019, H ouse Bill 2110 ( 86th Legislature, Regular Session) amended Government Code \u00a72114.002 to incorporate reporting on surveys gathered through mobile or web applications. In response to this addition, HHSC Center for Analytics and Decision Support (CADS) administered an online survey in August 2019 to learn more about the use of different survey formats by various DSHS and HHSC program s. The goal of the survey was to better understand the extent to which HHS programs use online or web- based survey applications to gather information from 11 clients or customers. A total of 71 HHS staff members responded to the survey, corresponding to 50 HHS program surveys (25 from DSHS and 25 from HHSC) .3 Survey results show that most (64 percent) HHS programs administer at least some of their surveys using online software. Many of these programs (63 percent) use paper or telephone surveys to supplement the online survey to capture as many respondents as possible. In choosing a survey format, programs considered survey accessibility, the availability of technology, convenience for respondents, and ease of use for both respondents and survey administrators. Survey Monkey is the most common platform for administering HHS surveys online. Other common platforms are Survey Gizmo and Qualtrics. HHS Learning Resource Network and IT division released new training resources for the Microsoft Forms online survey platform in August 2019. At the end of August 2019, only one program reported using Microsoft Forms. Among programs that do not use online surveys, most (71 percent) reported that their survey could not be adapted to an online format. T he two most common barriers to administering surveys online were 1) customers do not have access to the necessary technology to respond to an online survey, and 2) the program does not have the means to co ntact customers electronically. These findings indicate that the majority of surveys are being administered flexibly to meet the needs of the populations they target. O nline survey administration will likely continue to be supplemented with paper and telephone formats to comprehensively assess customer satisfaction. 2020 Guidance on Agency Strategic Plans In February 2020, the Office of the Governor's (OOG) Budget and Policy Team and the LBB published Instructions for Preparing and Submitting Agency Strategic Plans (the Instructions) f or SFY 2021 to 2025 . This document offers updated guidance for statutorily directed strategic planning submissions to ensure long -range planning is effective and efficiently uses state resources in service to the agency's core mission. 3 CADS targeted feedback on HHS's capacities for the administration of surveys and therefore included surveys falling outside the scope of customer satisfaction. 12 As part of this document, the OOG and LBB issued a new set of eight questions that should be added to all surveys that broadly address customer satisfaction with HHS programs and services. Because the Report on Customer Service is published biennially, the 2020 report includes consumer surveys conducted during SFYs 2 018 and 2019, before the OOG and the LBB published the Instructions. Therefore, none of the surveys included in this report were designed to address all eight questions outlined by the OOG and LBB. However, most surveys ask customers similar questions. See Table 3 for the LBB survey items and the number of programs that address each survey item. See Tables 4-11 for satisfaction ratings across surveys that address the topi cs covered by the 2020 guidance . HHSC CADS has communicated with internal HHS departments regarding how to best meet the additional LBB requirements in the 2022 Report on Customer Service. 13 Table 3: LBB- Required Survey Items and Utilization Across HHS Surveys LBB-Required Survey Items Number of DSHS programs that address survey items (N = 8) Number of HHSC programs that address survey items (N = 23 ) 1.

Each summary includes the sample and survey methods, the main findings and, if available, a link to the full report. These results present important information about customer satisfaction with services provided by HHS agencies. Because \u00a72114.002 of the Government Code requires that HHS agencies gather information from their customers about the quality of services, the term \"customers\" is used whe re appropriate throughout this report to indicate individuals who receive services from HHS agencies. Of note, many of the HHS agencies more commonly use the term \"consumer\" or \"individual\" to refer to service recipients. Appendix C presents a glossary of acronyms used in this report. 29 2. Department of State Health Services The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) services conducted eight surveys during SFY 2018 and SFY 2019 that collected customer satisfaction data . More than 2,700 responses were r eceived through these surveys, primarily from families of children with special health care needs or customers of regulatory, immunization, specialized health, community health, and laboratory services.

Community Health Improvement Children with Special Health Care Needs Systems Development Group Case Management and Family Supports and Community Resources Family Satisfaction Surveys Purpose The Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) Systems Development Group serves children ages 0 -21 with special health care needs, or any age with cystic fibrosis. The program works to strengthen community -based services to improve systems of care for children and youth with special health care needs. Families are 30 provided with case management and family support and community resource services related to gaining access to necessary medical, social, education, and other service needs. The purpose of the survey is to obtain information about whether the services provided are 1) accessible, 2) family -centered, 3) comprehensive, 4) coordinated, 5) compassionate, and 6) culturally effectiv e. The survey also asks the families to rate their overall satisfaction with services. The survey is conducted by the organizations contracted by the CSHCN Systems Development Group. The study population is families of children and youth with special health care needs who received serv ices from contracted providers. Sample and Methods One survey was conducted between September 1, 2017 and August 31, 2018. Another survey was conducted between September 1, 2018 and August 31, 2019. CSHCN contractors sought responses from all families served by their organization with CSHCN Systems Development Group funding. All families were sent a survey regardless of their status (active or closed). The study was conducted by paper and offered in E nglish and in Spanish. Individuals provided their responses by completing the survey themselves and returning it by mail to the contractor. The total number of completed responses for September 1, 2017 to August 31, 2018 was 887 out of 4,163 for a response rate of 21 .3 percent.

Laboratory and Infectious Disease Texas Vaccines for Children Provider Satisfaction Survey ( Clinic Site Visits ) Purpose Background Texas Vaccine for Children (TVFC) program enables overs 4.3 million Texas children to have access to immunizations. This is accomplished through a network of support provided by DSHS with the assistance from DSHS Public Health Regions (PHRs) and contracted Local Health Departments ( LHDs). These organizations function as the Responsible Entities (RE) to ensure compliance with state and federal standards and the effectiveness of vaccine distribution. As required by the cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Immunization Unit must conduct quality assurance site visits to at least 50 percent of the healthcare providers enrolled in the TVFC program each year. 35 Currently, the Immunization Unit contracts with the TMF Health Quality I nstitute (TMF) to conduct the quality assurance site visits for the private TVFC providers. Creation and monitoring of the site visit survey was part of Texas' corrective action plan for the CDC. The survey was implemented in 2016. Purpose and objective of the survey Provider site visit reviews are conducted to evaluate immunization service delivery and to review compliance with TVFC program requirements in areas such as vaccine ordering, storage and handling, TVFC eligibility screening, and record keeping. This summary will describe the assessment process for site reviewers conducting quality assurance visits for the TVFC p rogram. The main objective of the survey is to assess the knowledge, skills and abilities of the site reviewers with the overall compliance site visit. This survey is not only useful for monitoring the contracted DSHS quality assurance reviewers but also for identifying gaps and help to recommend corrective actions that need to be taken to improve compliance site reviews and/or revi ewers. Scope of the survey The respondents of the site visit survey are staff employed at clinics across Texas enrolled in TVFC. The questions on the site visit survey request staff opinions of several areas of the site visit. Those areas included: Schedul ing of the visit Reviewer presentation Reviewer punctuality Reviewer knowledge level of program Overall satisfaction of the compliance site visit Sample and Methods Introduction This section describes the methodology and it also describes the data collection and data management procedures. Methodology The survey adopted an electronic format in 2016 and has been revised each year. To ensure comparability of the results, only the questions that remain unchanged from year to year will be reviewed. For facilities enrolled in TVFC, the survey targeted the primary vaccine coordinators who is responsible for maintain ing 36 operations of the program within their assigned facility. TVFC providers receiving a compliance site visit were contacted via email the week following the visits. The email included instructions on completing the survey along with the hyperlink to the survey. There was not a requirement to complete the survey but completion was highly recommended. Data pro cessing, analysis and reporting Results received were exported from Survey Gizmo in an excel document and analyzed by a member of the Vaccine Operations Group ( VOG) policy and quality assurance team. The team reviewed the provider identification numbers ( PINs), completeness of the survey and reviewed respondent comments. After data cleaning, tables for the report were generated. The tables were generated from the various questions of the survey during the analysis phase. Tables were cre ated using Microsoft Excel. Major Findings Response Rate Table 12 shows the response rate for the 2018 Site Visits Survey. A total of 2,920 surveys were emailed to providers in 2018 , of which 897 responded to the survey, yielding a response rate of 30.7 perc ent. Table 12: TVFC Site Visits Survey Response Rates Survey Results Frequency Percent Completed 840 94.0% Partially Completed 57 6.0% Response Rate (completed & partial responses) 897 30.7% Total surveys sent 2,920 Quality and sat isfaction levels of site visits The survey sought to find out the overall satisfaction of the site visit conducted by the TMF. Table 13 demonstrate s the customer responses. Ninety -seven percent of the respondents were very satisfied or satisfied with the conducted site visit, with remaining percent having a contrary view. Ninety-five percent of respondents reported very satisfied or satisfied with the reviewer. Ninety -four percent of 37 respondents were satisfied with the preparation instructions that they received. Ninety -five percent of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with the time the reviewer spent at the facility. For each of these questions, approximately two thirds of the respondents answered that they were very satisfied.

Healthcare Coverage Eleven surveys captured customer satisfaction information from Texas HHSC clients receiving healthcare coverage since the last Report on Customer Service. The surveys summarized in this section were administered in state fiscal years 2018 - 2019. For readability, this section is organized in three subsections: 1. Child Healthcare Coverage 2. Adult Healthcare Coverage 3. Medical Transportation Program The child and adult healthcare surveys discussed here relate to Texas Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) services and the Medical 5 Historically HHSC administers the Independent Living Services Customer Satisfaction Survey and the Blind Children 's Vocational Discovery and Development Program Customer Satisfaction Survey . However , data was unavailable for SFY 2018 & SFY 2019. 47 Transportation Program (MTP) survey relates to non -emergency medical transportation (NEMT) services. Federal law requires state Medicaid programs to contract with an external quality review organization (EQRO) to help evaluate services. HHSC contracts with Institute for Child Health Policy (ICHP) at the University of Florida for this purpose , and ICHP conducted these surveys as part of their EQRO duties . The surveys assess members' or their caregivers' satisfaction with physical health, behavioral health, dental, or NEMT services. The questions on the surveys are primarily taken from nationally standardized survey instruments. Child Healthcare Coverage The surveys about services for children include: STAR Child Caregiver Member Survey STAR Health Caregiver Member Survey STAR Kids Caregiver Member Survey CHIP Caregiver Member Survey Child Core Measures Survey Medicaid and CHIP Dental Caregiver Survey The EQRO used a similar survey protocol for all surveys. Evaluators sent advance notification letters written in English and Spanish to caregivers of child members in Medicaid and CHIP requesting their participation in the surveys. Then the evaluators telephoned caregivers seven days a week in both day and evening hours (generally between 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Central) to complete the survey. Multiple attempts (up to 20 for most programs) were made to reach a family before a member's phone number was removed from the calling circuit. If a respondent was unable to complete the interview in English, evaluators referred the respondent to a Spanish- speakin g interviewer for a later time. The child healthcare surveys included questi ons from the following sources: The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS \u00ae) survey, a widely used instrument for measuring and reporting consumer experiences with their health plan and providers.6 Items developed by the EQRO pertaining to caregiver and member demographic and household characteristics . 6 https://www.ahrq.gov/cahps/index.html 48 The technical appendices for these reports can be found on the Texas Healthcare Learning Collaborative portal in the Member Surveys folder under Resources.7 STAR Child Caregiver Member Survey Purpose The EQRO conducts the STAR Child Caregiver Member Survey from May to September with caregivers of children who receive services funded through the Medicaid STAR program. STAR serves children in low- income families as well as adults who meet certain income and eligibility criteria. The program provides physical, behavioral health, and dental services for children. This survey reviews physical and behavioral health, and a separate survey examine s satisfaction with dental services. Surveys for adults and children in the STAR program are conducted separately. The purpose of the STAR Child Caregiver Member Survey is to determine the sociodemographic characteristics and health status of children enrolled in the STAR program and assess parental experiences and satisfaction with healthc are received by STAR enrollees. Specifically, the survey include s questions to address: The sociodemographic characteristics and health status of members Caregivers' satisfaction with their child's healthcare Access to and timeliness of care, including having a usual source of care Preventive care, including check -ups The need for and availability of specialized services Caregive rs' experiences with their child's health plan and customer service Healthcare needs as children with chronic conditions transition into adulthood Sample and Methods Participants for the STAR Child Caregiver Member Survey were selected from a stratified random sample of beneficiaries ages 17 and younger who were enrolled in STAR for six continuous months between October 2018 and March 2019. Members having no more than one 30 -day break in enrollment in the same managed care organization (MCO) during this period were included in the sampling frame . The sample was stratified to include representation from the 44 plan codes (MCO/service areas), plus a statewide sample of members in Permanency Care Assistance and Adoption Assistance. There were 1,143,706 clients who met the 7 https://thlcportal.com/resources/ 49 sampling frame criteria. The target number of completed surveys was 200 per plan code and 300 for MCOs operating in only one service area. While the sample was drawn from the beneficiaries (children), the survey was conducted with their parents/caregivers. There were 8,700 comple ted surveys with a response rate of 21 percent and a cooperation rate8 of 55 percent. Approximately 0.8 percent of the sampling frame completed the survey. Major Findings The EQRO presented the findings to HHSC for a number of domains which allows for the calculation and reporting of healthcare composites. These are scores that combine results for closely related survey items, providing a comprehensive, yet concise summary of results for multiple survey questions. The scores in Table 17, Table 18, and Table 19 present the survey's composites. Table 17: STAR Child Caregiver Member Survey CAHPS Composites: Percent \"Always\" Having Positive Experiences * Satisfaction Domain % of Respondents AHRQ National Average (2019) ** Getting Needed Care 62.3% 61.0% Getting Care Quickly 76.1% 73.0% How Well Doctors Communicate 82.9% 79.0% Customer 68.0% Coordination of Care * CAHPS composite rates and CAHPS -based HHSC Dashboard indicators in this report are calculated following the \"top box\" (percent always) method.

Surveys for adults and children in Medicaid were conducted separately. The purpose of the Adult Core Measures Survey is to assess overall member experiences with Medicaid in Texas. Results from these surveys were used in the SFY 2019 Child and Adult Core Measures reporting to CMS. Sample and Methods Participants for the Adult Core Measure Survey were selected from a stratified random sample of beneficiaries ages 18 to 64 who were enrolled in Medicaid (STAR, STAR+PLUS, STAR Kids, and Fee -For-Service) for six continuous months between October 2017 and March 2018. There were 665,625 clients who met the sampling frame criteria. The target number of completed surveys was 411. Approximately 0.1 percent of the sampling frame completed the survey. Major Findings The EQRO presented the findings to HHSC for a number of domains which allows for the calculation and reporting of healthcare composites. These are scores that combine results for closely related survey items, providing a comprehensive, yet concise summary of result s for multiple survey questions. The scores in Table 46, Table 47 and Table 48 present the survey's composites. 79 Table 46.

Since there is no nationally standardized transportation survey to use, the EQRO developed questions based on other non -emergency medical transportation (NEMT) services. The NEMT survey was conducted by the University of Florida Survey Research Center (UFSRC). Medical Transportation Program Member Survey Purpose The EQRO conducts the Medical Transportation Program Member Survey from June to August with members and their caregivers who use Medical Transportation Program (MTP) services funded through Texas Medicaid. The MTP provides NEMT to assist Medicaid members and their caregivers when they go to necessary medical services. The MTP offers a range of services including mass transit services, demand response services, mileage reimbursement, meals and lodging assistance, advance funds, and a reservation line. The purpose of the Medical Transportation Program Member Survey is to examine member experience and satisfaction with MTP services in all transportation regions in Texas. The aims of the MTP study include: Describing Medicaid member experiences with MTP services ac ross all transportation regions Assessing member knowledge of available services in all regions 81 Assessing overall member satisfaction with MTP processes and services in all regions Sample and Methods Participants for the Medical Transportation Program Member Survey were selected from a stratified random sample of beneficiaries ages 0 to 99 who were enrolled in Medicaid for 12 continuous months between September 2017 and October 2018 with no more than one 30 -day break in enrollment, and who used MTP services during that 12 -month period. Participants include d child, adult, and adult proxy members. Client counts were not made available for inclusion in this report before publication. The sample was stratified to include representation from the 13 plan codes (MTO/ service areas), with a target number of 200 completed surveys per plan code. There were 2,000 surveys completed with a response rate of 18 percent and cooperation rate of 50 percent. Major Findings The EQRO presented findings to HHSC for two domains based on the results. Table 49 and Table 50 present survey results that describe these findings through member awareness, utilization, knowledge, and experience in relation to MTP services. The scores present the survey's percenta ges related to the key finding. Member Awareness Member awareness about services varied by service type . A larger percentage of members were aware of demand response services and mileage reimbursement than were aware of meals and lodging or advanced funds services (Table 49). 82 Table 49: MTP Member Survey - Member Awareness, Percent Reporting Familiarity with Service MTP Service % of Respondents Mass Transit 80.0% Demand Response Services 89.6% Mileage Reimbursement 78.2% Meals and Lodging 31.5% Advance Funds Services 20.4% Member Experience with MTP Services The EQRO calculated an overall satisfaction score based on the average percent of members that reported being \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with each of the five NEMT services. Overall, more than 80 percent of members in all regions were \"satisfied\" or \" very satisfied\". Table 50 shows the percentage of members they were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with each of the service types and the overall composit e for the state. Table 50: MTP Member Survey - Member Satisfaction , Percent Responding \"Satisfied\" or \" Very Satisfied\" MTP Service % of Respondents Mass Transit 86.0% Demand Response 92.5% Mileage Reimbursement 90.4% Meals and Lodging 90.2% Advance Funds 93.8% Overall Satisfaction (Composite) 90.6% 83 II. Access and Eligibility Services Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Community Partner Interview Surveys Purpose Texas participates in the Food and Nutrition Service's (FNS) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Community Partner Interview (CPI) Demonstration Project. With this, HHSC received approval from FNS to allow specific food bank outreach staff to conduct SNAP interviews, gather verifications and submit applications to HHSC for approval. (HHSC is still required to make the final determination of eligibility.) Each year, FNS requires HHSC to conduct a customer satisfaction survey with at least 200 individuals who apply for SNAP benefits at each of five local food banks: Houston, North Texas, San Antonio, South Plains, and Tarrant. The FNS -created survey is facilitated by HHSC CADS who distributes copies of the survey to participating food banks where the surveys are administered. CADS is also responsible for entering and analyzing customer satisfaction surveys as part of an annual CPI report submitted to FNS. Sample and Methods In June 2018 and 2019, CADS mailed surveys to the five participating food banks along with scripts for the workers to use, instructions on how to distribute the surveys, return envelopes, and a collection box for use at the food bank. The number of surveys sent to each food bank was based on response rates at each site in previous years, and the number of surveys need ed from each food bank so their customers would be proportionately represented. CADS sent e xtra surveys to each site to ensure at least 200 surveys would be collected. A convenience sample was utilized at each location. Food bank staff conducted SNAP interviews at several sites within their service area, including but not limited to food banks, affiliated food pantries, shelters, customers' homes, and community events and fairs. Upon the conclusion of every SNAP interview during the survey period, one applicant per household was provided a survey and return envelope and asked to complete the survey, seal it in the return envelope, and return it to the interviewer or return it by mail. In sites where interviewers expected to interview more than one household, SNAP interviewers could also desig nate an area away from where they conducted interviews for the customer to complete the survey and 84 deposit it in a survey drop box. Food bank staff then mailed the completed surveys to HHSC CADS. Food bank staff followed this procedure until all surveys we re completed or the survey period ended (approximately 6 -8 weeks after CADS mailed surveys out to food banks). The survey was available in English and Spanish. Food banks were enthusiastic to participate in the survey , with some sites photocopying surveys and returning more surveys that initially issued. Return rates from the five food banks in 2018 ranged from 40 percent to over 100 percent.22 Overall, food banks returned 431 of 455 mailed surveys for a return rate of 95 percent. Return rates from the five food banks in 2019 ranged from 66 percent to over 100 percent.23 Overall , food banks returned 374 of 350 initially mailed surveys for a return rate of over 100 percent. Major Findings The findings of the study indicate a high level of cu stomer satisfaction with their SNAP application process at local food banks in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, 71 percent of respondents completed surveys in English and 28 percent in Spanish.24 In 2019, 70 percent of surveys were completed in English and 30 percent in Spanish. Location Customers were asked why they selected this location to apply for SNAP benefits. They were given many options and could select all that applied (Table 51 ). 22 Houston food bank requested additional surveys in 2018 and printed their own surveys resulting in a return rate greater than 100 percent. 23 Multiple food banks requested additional surveys in 2019, or copied existing surveys, resulting in return rates greater than 100 percent. 24 Language could not be determined for two surveys in 2018 so percentages do not add to 100. 85 Table 51: Reason for Selection of Location Option 2018 Proportion of Respondents* (n=431) 2019 Proportion of Respondents* (n=374) You didn't know there was another way to apply 6% 7% You go here for other services 17% 22% You feel comfortable going here 48% 46% It is conveniently located 23% 25% It has convenient hours of operation 10% 14% You don't have to wait a long time here 19% 18% The people who work here are friendly 33% 35% The people who work here speak your language 15% 18% Someone referred you here 18% 20% Don't know 0% 1% * Percentages do not add to 100 since respondents could choose multiple options. Experience Respondents were asked four questions related to their experience in applying for SNAP benefits at a community site. In 2018: Most respondents waited for less than 30 minutes ( 66 percent), while 16 percent waited 30 to 60 minutes, and 16 percent waited over an hour. Most respondents thought the application process was easier than before ( 56 percent), while 27 percent thought it was about the same, only 4 percent thought it was harder, and for 10 percent of respondents it was their first time to apply. Almost all respondents ( 98 percent) thought the location offered enough privacy. 86 Ninety -nine percent of respondents strongly agreed ( 79 percent) or agreed (20 percent) that the staff were knowledgeable about the SNAP application procedures. Similarly, in 2019: Most respondents waited for less than 30 minutes ( 69 percent), while 15 percent waited 30 to 60 minutes, and 15 percent waited over an hour. Most respondents thought the application process was easier than before ( 57 percent), while 28 percent thought it was about the same , only 2 percent thought it was harder, and for 11 percent of respondents it was their first time to apply. Almost all respondents (9 6 percent) thought the location offered enough privacy. Ninety -eight percent of respondents strongly agreed ( 74 percent) or agreed (24 percent) that the staff were knowledgeable about the SNAP application procedures. Satisfaction Overall, respondents were satisfied with the SNAP interview process. In 2018, most respondents were very satisfied ( 82 percent) or satisfied (16 percent) with their experience. High levels of satisfaction continued in 2019, with almost all respondents indicating they were very satisfied ( 79 percent) or satisfied ( 19 percent) with their experience. YourTexasBenefits.Com Survey Purpose Historically, Texa ns who have wanted to apply for public benefits such as Medicaid, TANF, CHIP, or SNAP have done so by visiting eligibility offices and working with clerks and other HHSC staff. HHSC created the YourTexasBenefits.com website to give customers the opportunity to manage their benefits online rather than going into an eligibility office. Customers use the website to apply for and/or renew benefits, view their case statuses, report changes to their cases, view their SNAP and TANF benefit balances, and upload verifications needed for determining eligibility. Since 2012, HHSC increasingly promotes the website, and customers who come into offices in person may be asked to use the website to perform tasks they can complete themselves. Most eligibility offices have computers that clients can 87 use to access the website. In 2016, the website was redesigned so it could also be accessed from mobile devices and tablets. After customers use the YourTexasBenefits.com website and log out, all users are prompted to complete a br ief online survey. The purpose of this ongoing survey is to assess customers' satisfaction and experiences with the changes to the website. Client counts were not made available for inclusion in this report before publication. The current survey collects data about: Device type Reasons and frequency for using YourTexasBenefits.com How customer heard about YourTexasBenefits .com Expected future use of YourTexasBenefits.com Perception of use on a mobile device or tablet Perception of ease of use for account c reation Sample and Methods The YourTexasBenefits.com survey went live in August 2012 and was updated in September 2016 when HHSC launched the redesigned website. It was available in both English and Spanish and includes 10 questions. The number of questions customers were prompted to answer varie d depending on their reasons for using the website. In 2017, there were 66,999 completed surveys - an average of 5,583 responses per month. In addition, 2,330 surveys were in itiated but were not completed. In 2018, there were 50,521 completed surveys - an average of 4,210 responses per month. In addition, 1,662 surveys were in itiated but were not completed. In 2019 (January 1, 2019 through November 15, 2019), there were 40,783 completed surveys - an average of 3,399 responses per month. In addition, 1,464 surveys were initiated but were not completed. Major Findings Most respondents were satisfied with the ir experience using mobile devices or tablets to access the Your Texas Benefits website . Yearly results from calendar years 2017 -2019 are presented below. 88 Positive Findings and Usage The maj ority of respondents indicated: It was easy or very easy to set up an account: 84 percent (2017) 82 percent (2018) 82 percent (2019) Their experience using a tablet or mobile phone to access YourTexasBenefits.com was good or very good: 70 percent (2017) 69 percent (2018) 72 percent (2019) They were visiting the site to apply for or renew benefits: 98 percent (2017) 96 percent (2018) 95 percent (2019) Opportunities for Improvement Of those who applied for or renewed their benefits online, some customers found at least one question (or website section) confusing or hard to answer. 42 percent (2017) 44 percent (2018) 42 percent (2019) Customers reported the mo st confusing or difficult website question (section) w as: Uploading files (\" about people on my case, things I own, money I get, etc. \") 13 percent (2017) 14 percent (2018) 15 percent (2019) III. Quality Reviews Nursing Facility Quality Review Purpose The Quality Monitoring Program (QMP) helps detect conditions in Texas nursing facilities that could be detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of residents. It is not a regulatory program and quality monitors do not cite deficient practices. 89 Quality monitors focus on nursing facilities that have a history of resident care deficiencies, or that have been identified as having a higher- than- average risk of being cited for significant deficiencies in future surveys conducted by the HHSC Regulatory Services surveyors. The Nursing Facility Quality Review (NFQR) is a statewide survey of Texas nursing facility residents to evaluate the quality of care residents received and how satisfied they were with the quality of life in the nursing facility. The NFQR has been conducted since 2002; annually between 2002 and 2010, and biennially since 2010. HHS contracts with The University of Texas at Austin School of Nursing for data collection . NFQR data helps QMP identify opportunities for statewide improvement and measure s statewide changes in the quality of services provided across time. Sample and Methods Data collection for NFQR 201 7-2018 began in April 2017 and continued through December 2018. Nurses hired by The University of Texas at Austin School of Nursing visited 957 Medicaid -certified nursing facilities across the state, using a structured survey instrument to evaluate the quality of care provided to a random sample of residents . The total sample size was 1,827 residents (one percent of 188,941 total residents ). While on -site, the nurses also interviewed residents to determine satisfaction with services received and their overall quality of life in the facility. Interpreters were used as necessary for the interviews. Census information from a nursing facility's most recent regulatory survey visit was used to establish that facility's sample size; usually one to three residents in each facility. A list of randomly generated numbers was then prepared for each facility. This list and a roster provided by the nursing facility were used by the nurse reviewers to select residents for the sample. For example, if the random number was five, then the fifth resident on the facility's roster was selected for the sample. Staff at HHS analyzed the data using statistical software to test for linear trends across time, either from the first year data was collected on a particular measure, or from when there was a change in the wording of a question that prevented comparison to the data from previous years. The findings documented in the report came directly from the resident assessments and interviews completed by the nurse reviewers. Additional information was obtained from: 90 Evaluations of residents' Medication Administration Records (MARs) and supporting documentation Data provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Major Findings The NFQR evaluate d many clinical measures related to quality of care, as well as residents' satisfaction with the quality of care they received in the facility and with their quality of life. The findings summarized below focus on the quality of life measures and residents' satisfaction with the services they received in the nursing facility. Overall Satisfaction In general, residents interviewed during the on- site visits expressed satisfaction with their overall experience in the nursing facility and the care they received. This finding was not significantly different from previous NFQR surveys (Table 52). Table 52: NFQR Overall Satisfaction Findings: Proportion of Respondents* That Indicated Somewhat Satisfied, Satisfied, or Very Satisfied Satisfaction Measure 2009 (N=2,164) 2010 (N=2,172) 2013 (N=2,166) 2015 (N=1,556) 2017 (N=1,827) Expressed satisfaction with the nursing facility 89% 90% 89% 89% 87% Expressed satisfaction received 90% 90% 91% 90% 88% * Proportions \"very dissatisfied.\" Those who did not answer the survey question are not counted in these proportions. 91 Specific Quality of Life/Consumer Satisfaction Measures These measures include d the resident's satisfaction with relationships, activities, autonomy, privacy, and feelings of safety/security at the facility. Several measures demonstrated statistically significant improvement or declines over time, while others remained relati vely stable (Table 53). Table 53: NFQR Specific Satisfaction Measures: Proportion of Respondents* That Indicated Sometimes, Most of the Time, o r Always Satisfaction Measure 2010 (N=2,172) 2013 (N=2,166) 2015 (N=1,556) 2017 available N/A N/A 88% 84%** Stated weekend activities (other than religious activities) were available N/A N/A 70% 60%** Liked the food served at the facility N/A N/A 81% 84% Felt that their possessions were safe at the facility N/A N/A 88% 90% Felt safe and secure at the nursing facility N/A N/A 97% 97% Stated staff members treated them with N/A N/A 98% 97% 92 2015 (N=1,556) 2017 (N=1,827) Stated they were to choose their daily schedule N/A N/A 71% 69% Stated they could choose when and how to bathe N/A N/A 64% 52%** Stated they participated in their care plan meeting N/A N/A 31% 48%** Stated they had concerns the facility did not address 13% 15% 20% 16%** Stated they did not express concerns due to a fear of retaliation 4% 7% 8% 7%** * Proportions indicate respondents who chose responses \"sometimes,\" \"most of the time,\" or \"always,\" rather than \"rarely,\" or \"never.\" Those who did not answer the survey question are not counted in t hese proportions. ** Measures demonstrating statistically sign ificant improvement or decline. Long Term Servi ces and Supports Quality Review Purpose The Long -term Services and Supports Quality Review (LTSSQR) is a state wide survey of people receiving in -home, community- based, or institutional services and supports offered by HHSC. The purpose of the LTSSQR survey is to describe the perceived quality and adequacy of long -term services and supports administered by HHSC, co nsumer quality of life, and trends in long -term services and supports, from the perspective of those receiving services. The LTSSQR is a statewide representative survey of people receiving in -home, community- based, or 93 institutional services and supports, excluding nursing facility care, offered by HHSC. Prior to the 2017 LTSSQR Summary and Detailed reports, the LTSSQR reports were required by the 2012 -13 General Appropriations Act, H.B. 1, 82nd Legislature, Regular Session, 2011 (Article II, Department of Aging and Disability Services, Rider 13). The 84th Legislature, Regular Session, 2015, repealed Rider 13; however, the LTSSQR continues . The LTSSQR reports provide information on consumers' experiences receiving services in HHSC programs to the Texas Legislature, HHSC, and stakeholders. The reports also include data about quality of life, which encompasses aspects of a person's life that are not necessarily related to the direct delivery of services or supports (e.g., whether a person has relationships or friends), but help demonstrate how satisfied HHSC consumers feel about the quality of their lives. The surveys enable HHSC staff to assess success and deficiencies over time, identify areas for improvement, and measure the effectiveness of implemented improvement strategies. The report is not regulatory in nature, but rather a method to identify areas for improvement. HHSC is contracted with the Public Policy Research Institute at Texas A&M University (PPRI), to administer the surveys. Sample and Method s The study sought responses from people receiving services, or their family members and guardians . Feedback about services was solicited through face -to- face, telephone, web, and mail surveys. The report include d results from HHSC programs and consumer types (i.e., families of children with disabilities, adults with IDD, adults with physical disabilities) for three nationally validated surveys (Table 54). Using nationall y recognized surveys allowed HHSC to share data nationally and to conduct additional analyses by benchmarking Texas' performance in the national arena. The three surveys were organized across five general topics or domains: health and welfare, individual choice and respect, community inclusion, systems performance, and services satisfaction - each of which was divided into sub- domains (e.g., \"employment\" was a sub -domain of community inclusion). The sub -domains were measured by one or more performance indicators, which were developed based on criteria such as the measure's usefulness as a benchmark and feasibility of collecting the data. 94 Table 54: Overview of Target Population by Data Collection Instr ument, 2017 Sample Survey Target Population Method of Administration Total # Served Total # Surveyed National Core Indicators (NCI) Survey Adults 19 and older with IDD receiving at least one service besides case management In-person interview 36,189 2,320 Participant Experience Survey (PES) Adults, primarily older adults, with physical disabilities In-person, phone, web 58,020 2,581 Child Family Survey Families of children with disabilities, under age 22 living at home Mail, phone, web 10,631 1,338 Proportional probability for size (PPS) sampling was used to select the study sample. Representative samples were drawn from each program so that findings could be generalized to all individuals in a specific program. The target population was stratified by county and program to ensure geographic and programmatic diversity. The number of people chosen was proportional to the number of people in the selected program served in each county. Participants were then randomly chosen from people in each stratum who had service authorizations for the programs included in the survey. The data were collected between January 2016 and December 2017 for the January 2019 LTSSQR report. The survey population encompasse d 17 programs, including five Medicaid waiver programs , 25 11 Medicaid non- waiver programs, and one General Revenue program . All of the surveys, whether disseminated by mail, web, telephone, or face -to-face 25 The five Medicaid waiver programs included in the LTSSQR survey population were the Community Living Assistance and Support Services (CLASS) waiver, the Home and Community -based Services (HCS) waiver, the Texas Home Living (TxHmL) waiver, the Deaf Blind with Multiple Disabilities ( DBMD) waiver, and the Medically Dependent Children Program (MCDCP) waiver. 95 interviews, were available in English or Spanish. The sample size for each program was calculated to obtain a confidence level of 95 percent and a confidence interval of 5. In 2017, HHSC collected 4,901 adult surveys (2,320 adults with IDD and 2,581 adults with physical disabilities) and 1,338 Child Family (CF) surveys ( Table 54). Major Findings Positive Outcomes Children Most respondents were satisfied with system performance (Figure 1). Sixty-nine percent of the families of children with disabilities reported that services were available when they needed them. Almost three -quarters (72 percent) of the CF survey respondents reported flexible services and supports, which usually changed to meet their family member's changing needs. Integrati on into the community was good; 82 percent of children with disabilities reported participating in community activities and 83 percent reported having friends who did not have a disability. Seventy -six percent of families reported having control over hiring and management of support workers. Overall, 82 percent of families served reported that they were always or usually satisfied with their services and supports . 96 Figure 1. Overall Consumer Satisfaction with Services and Supports Availability by Survey Population Adults with IDD Adults with IDD living in a State Supported Living Center ( SSLC), Intermediate Care Facility ( ICF), or community- based group hom e, received higher rates of routine and preventive care than those living with family. Almost all (98 percent) of adults with IDD had primary healthcare providers. Most adults with IDD made everyday choices, such as how they spend their free time (82 percent) and what to buy with the ir spending money (82 percent). Adults with Physical Disabilities The majority of individuals reported that their rights were respected, they were treated respectfully by their support staff, they felt safe in their homes and neighborhoods, and they knew how to report abuse or problems. Services and supports made a positive difference in adults with physical disabilities' health and wellbeing (91 percent). Overall, 91 percent of adults with physical disabilities reported that they were satisfied with the services and supports they receive d. 97 Opportunities for Improvement Children Approximately 8 percent of children with disabilities failed to access needed equipment such as wheelchairs, ramps, or communication devices, and to receive needed services. Most frequently requested services were for various therapies (speech, physical, occupational, aqua, equine) and for trained respite care providers. Failure to receive needed equipment, services and supports has improved since last biennium, when 13 percent of children with disabilities indicated it was an issue . Adults with IDD Individuals living independently or with their families received less routine and preventive healthcare than those living in commun ity-based homes or institutional settings on every health measure. Routine and preventive healthcare examinations are critical to avoiding or ameliorating conditions affecting quality of life, morbidity, or mortality, and their associated costs. Less than half of the respondents made major life decisions about where they live, who they lived with, and the staff who supported them. Most adults with IDD did not have options about where they lived. Texas rates of community participation were lower than the national average. Only 9 percent adults with IDD had community -based jobs. Twelve percent of respondents reported they did not receive all the services they needed. Education and training, assistance with transportation, and assistance with finding a job were highly correlated services and were among the top four services requested. Adults w ith Physical Disabilities About two -third of the adults with physical disabilities reported that they did not always have enough money to buy the things they need. Among requested needs, assistance with acquiring medications, nutrition/food, and help with air conditioning and heating bills were common, all critical needs. About one-third of adults with physical disabilities we re lacking important immunizations - 26 percent lacked influenza vaccinations, 2 7 percent lack ed pneumococcal vaccinations , 80 percent lack ed shingles vaccination, and 90 percent had not received meningococcal vaccination. Since individuals in this group have significant health risks, lack of immunizat ions is a concern. 98 In adults with physical disabilities, large percentages had not had recent dental (62 percent), vision ( 23 percent), or hearing (6 3 percent) examinations. Poor dental care can compromise overall health, and vision and hearing impairments become increasingly common with age. Eleven percent reported that they could not always go to the doctor when they needed to go. These individuals are at risk of further debility and disability as a result. More than one -third (33 percent) did not have control over their transportation, a critical issue for accessing medical care and for community inclusion. Overall, the survey results indicate that people perceive d that they received the services and supports they need to maintain their health and wellbei ng. Respondents' health and welfare appeared to be protected, as reports of staff disrespect, neglect, or abuse were very low, and people were generally satisfied with their services. One notable exception was the perceived decrease in access to therapeutic interventions, such as physical, occupational, physical, and behavioral therapies, which all three populations listed as impairing their quality of life. Other opportunities for improvement differ ed by subpopulation as enumerated above . To support choice and control for people receiving services, the agency has continued to expand the Consumer Directed Services (CDS) option among adults with IDD and children, but self- determination remain ed an area where Texas lags behind national benchmarks. The results of the LTSSQR survey positively reinforce d internal and external strategic initiatives. Consumer Rights and Services Survey Purpose Complaint and Incident Intake (CII) receives complaints and incidents regarding acute and long- term providers who are licensed/certified by HHSC. HHSC staff investigates these complaints and notifies the person who made the complaint about the findings. Additionally, the CII staff provides information about HHSC services and supports through their website and hotline. Offering call center surveys allows CII to look at call center performance and overall customer satisfaction rates. Customer feedback provides highly actionable information and insight for increasing and sustaining customer satisfaction. The survey result s are used as a resource to identify areas of efficiencies and areas of opportunity for improvement. 99 The study population is comprised of callers who contacted the Complaint Intake Call Center September 1, 2017, through August 31, 2019. Sample and Methods This survey has been collected or distributed in various formats since May 2006. Prior to November 2012, the survey was conducted by sending survey requests by U.S. mail to individuals who filed complaints through the CII hotline for the following facility types: nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, privately owned intermediate care facilities for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, State Supported Living Centers, day activity and health service providers, and home and community support service agencies. To achieve business efficiencies, a survey link was added to the CII website in November 2012, and CII discontinued mailing the surveys via U.S. mail. The email option was discontinued after SFY 2014. In April 2015, CII transitioned to an automated telephone survey which replaced the previous survey option. Upon completion of intake, both in and outbound callers were manually transferred into the survey by hotline agents if they indicated they wished to complete the survey. Effective November 2018, the provider types that CII serves expanded due to Transformation initiatives. Prior to this date, CII served only long -term care providers; after Nov. 2018, this was expanded to include acute care providers such as hospitals, end stage renal disease providers, ambulatory surgical centers, substance abuse treatment facilities, and others. In addition, the survey methodology changed at this time due to a software upgrade to the Verint system. Most recently, an automated telephone optio n offered the survey to all inbound callers and then transferred those callers who agree d into the survey module at the completion of the hotline call. Surveys were available in English and Spanish. The survey instrument include d six customer satisfaction questions with responses on a 5 -point Likert Major Findings In SFY 2018, CII received 1 ,692 total survey responses , of which 1,174 were complete (2.2 percent of 52,535 total intakes ). In SFY 2019, CII received 784 survey responses (1.3 percent of 59,184 total intakes ); due to changes in the 100 automated telephone system , this total include d any caller transferred into the automated survey system who provided a response to at least one survey question. Customer satisfaction findings from the CII Survey are presented in Table 55. Table 55.

IV. Health, Development, and Independence Services Early Childhood Intervention Family Survey Purpose The Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) program serves children from birth to 36 months of age who have developmental delays or disabilities as well as their families. The program provides early intervention services to help families and caregivers strengthen their ability to improve the child's development through everyday activities in the home and community. Services are provided through a statewide system of community -based programs. The family survey is administered to a sample of parents or caregivers every year. 101 The purpose of the survey/series of interviews is to assess: Family perceptions of ECI services, including customer satisfaction Families' experiences with ECI services and service providers Families' recorded competencies in helping their children develop and learn The survey is administered in compliance with the regulations for early intervention programs from the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) at the U.S. Department of Education. Statewide data are reported as part of ECI's Annual Performance Report to OSEP. Sample and Methods ECI used multiple methods to deliver surveys and select samples. The study sought responses from families who were randomly selected. Families were not included in more than one sample. In SFY 2018, the survey was conducted by ECI through the 44 contracted agencies who deliver ECI services. In SFY 2019, the survey was conducted by ECI through the 42 contracted agencies who deliver ECI services. The study population was parents or guardians of children who had been enrolled in the ECI program for at least six months as of April 1 of that year. This criterion was established to ensure the family had sufficient experience with the program to respond to the questions. The study was conducted using the following methods : Online - the state office sent letters to families in the sample that included a link to the SurveyMonkey website with the FOS -R survey. Hand- Delivery - the local ECI contractors distributed a Scantron survey. Program staff handed the survey to families at the time of a home visit or Individualized Family Service Plan meeting. Families returned the surveys directly to the ECI State Office in a postage -paid envelope . The surveys/interviews were offered online and by paper in English and Spanish. All versions contained the same questions and response options. Individuals provided their responses by completing the survey themselves. If families requested assistance in completing the survey, ECI service coordinators were instructed to find another community resource for this assistance so ECI staff would not be involved in completing the survey. 102 For the April 2018 -May 2018 survey, a total of 5,551 families (9.7 percent) were randomly selected to respond to the survey out of the 57,485 children who received comprehensive ECI services in SFY 2018. Of these surveys, 1,012 were undeliverable due to changes in address, family discharging from ECI, or the service coordinator or staff member being unable to reach the family. A total of 4,539 families received it; 1,560 returned the survey. This resulted in 34.4 percent of respondent families participating in ECI's family outcomes survey. For the May 2019 -June 2019 survey, a total of 6,708 families (11.1 percent) were randomly selected to respond to the survey out of the 60,596 children who received comprehensive ECI services in SFY 2019. Of these surveys, 1,151 were undeliverable due to changes in address, family discharging from ECI, or the service coordinator or staff member being unable to reach the family. A total of 5,557 families received it; 1,914 returned the survey. This resulted in 34 .0 percent of respondent families participating in ECI's family outcomes survey. Responses to survey questions were combined into composite scores for the three domains measured by the survey instrument, following federally recommended procedures. The percentage of respondents who agreed that early intervention services helped with each of the three domains, based on their composite scores, is shown below. Major Findings The findings o f the study were as follows: Family Experiences with Services - 2018 Eighty -eight percent responded that early intervention services helped the family members know their rights. Eighty -nine percent responded that early intervention services helped the family members effectively communicate their children's needs. Ninety percent responded that early intervention services helped the family members help their children develop and learn. Family Experiences with Services - 2019 Eighty -seven percent responded that early intervention services helped the family members know their rights. Eighty -eight percent responded that early intervention services helped the family me mbers effectively communicate their children's needs. 103 Eighty -nine percent responded that early intervention services helped the family members help their children develop and learn. Autism Program Satisfaction Survey Purpose The Children's Autism Program works in partnership with local community agencies through grant contracts to provide applied behavior analysis (ABA) services for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). According to the U.S. CDC about one in 59 children has been identified with ASD. Boys are nearly four times more likely to be diagnosed with autism than girls. Autism Program services include assessments and ABA treatment services in the home, community or clinic. To be eligible for these services, children 3 through 15 years of age must have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum and be a Texas resident. The purpose of the survey is to assess: Parent or caregiver satisfaction with Autism Program services and service providers Parent or caregiver satisfaction with their children's progress Sample and Methods The survey population included families whose children have completed Autism Program services and exited the program, and families whose children have aged out of the Autism Program. The service provider provide d all families with a survey as the children exit the program. The surveys were offered in English and in Spanish. Individuals complete d the survey themselves by mailing a paper survey to HHSC. The survey consist ed of seven questions related to areas of satisfaction with the services, and 12 questions related to the respondent's perception of their child's progress in specific behavioral domains (e.g., following directions, responding to requests). There were 1,301 exits from the Autism Program in SFY 2018 and SFY 2019. Each time a child exited the program, the family was provided an opportunity to respond 104 to the survey. A total of 202 responses were received between September 1, 2017 and August 31, 2019, representing a return rate of 15.5 percent ( 202/1,301 ). Major Findings The majority of respondents to the survey were satisfied or very satisfied with the services their children received ( Table 56). The majority of the respondents to the surve y reported their children made good or great progress in the behavioral domains specified (Table 57).

Your WIC Experience Survey Purpose The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is a federally funded, state -administered nutrition program that helps low- income pregnant women, postpartum and breastfeeding women, infants, and children up to the age of five that are at nutritional risk. Eligible participants may 106 receive nutrition education and counseling, breastfeeding support, nutritious foods, and healthcare referrals for other services that improve health outcomes. The purpose of the Your WIC Experience survey is to gather ongoing, real -time client feedback on clients' recent WIC visits. The survey invitation is sent via text message to every client who was issued WIC benefits the day before. Sample and Methods The survey was administered daily by state agency staff who built the survey, ticketing conditions, and dashboard summaries in the Qualtrics Research Suite (Qualtrics). This real- time survey platform allowed staff to send a short text message inviting all WIC clients who visited a local WIC clinic within the previous 24 hours to complete a short customer satisfaction survey. The survey was automatically sent in the WIC client's preferred language (English or Spanish). Client survey responses were tied back to their specific local agency and further down to their specific clinic. This feature provide d WIC clinic staff the ability to track and respond immediately to customer feedback following a clinic visit. Results from the client feedback populate d and display ed in a real time dashboard that state and local agency users could view, analyze, and follow in real time 24/7. Reports from the dashboard were available to provide a point- in-time snapshot upon request or at any time to other licensed Qualtrics users that worked on this project with WIC. The study population include d every WIC family who elected to click on the survey link in the text message. When a client click ed on the survey link in the text message, it took them to the Qualtrics survey online. The total number of completed responses was over 55,900 between February 2019 and October 2019 for a response rate of 6 percent. Major Findings This was the first closed feedback loop survey mechanism that Texas WIC deployed statewide to assess a real -time client experience. The survey provide d a standardized set of customer experience questions to all WIC clients at every clinic in the state. The survey provide d local agencies with specific comments from clients that local agencies could address immediately with clinics. An innovative ticketing interface allowed certain pre -identified triggers (e.g., negative client experience, requests for a follow up call, negative trouble words in open comment fields) to immediately generate a \"ticket\" that was emailed to clinic staff for appropriate follow up . Ninety -four percent of the feedback was positive, and these testimonials 107 were used to reward and engage with local WIC staff. Clients also gave feedback on their shopping experience at WIC -authorized stores. Historically, paper and online WIC surveys were provided to a much smaller proportion of clients either in the clinics or with a web link on the WIC client -facing website. Typically, responses were generally positive. Using short message service (SMS) technology outside of the WIC clinic, the survey generated more responses than previous efforts. Although the client satisfaction with WIC overall was high, this new methodology helped identify underlying causes for some clients not having satisfactory experiences at their local clinic. Happiness with WIC visit At the time of this report, 55,900 WIC clients had completed surveys. The WIC program has consistently maintained an aggregate rating of 6.5 out of 7 (1=extremely unhappy to 7=extremely happy) for their WIC clinic visits. A net promoter score is a customer loyalty metric that gauges how willing a customer is to recommend a product or service. A net promoter score question was recently introduced to the survey and out of a sample of 5,000 WIC clients who received this question, 80 percent were promoters of WIC (i.e., extremely likely to refer a friend or colleague to their WIC clinic). Of the 55,900 client satisfaction survey responses in Qualtrics, 14,300 provided a positive comment to the question, \"If there is anything else you'd like to tell us about your visit, pl ease write your comment here.\" The m ost commonly used adjectives were friendly, helpful, nice, great service, and thank you. Clinic Improvements Only about 3,000 respondents (5 percent) offered feedback that suggested a need for improvement. WIC local agencies have been able to share these suggestions for improvement with their staff. Wait time and poor customer service were the most frequently documented feedback suggesting opportunities for clinic improvement. Clients who indicated that they were unhappy with their recent WIC visit were asked, \"How can our clinic improve?\" WIC was able to theme 2,099 open comments for this question ( Table 58). 108 Table 58: How can our clinic improve? Themes Count Percent Wait time 1,447 57% Staff rude, unpleasant, or unhelpful 482 19% Issue with formula 111 4% Issue with clinic flow or computer system 109 4% Card not updated 108 4% Understaffed 97 4% Better communication needed 69 3% Clinic environment uncomfortable 65 3% Staff need more training 34 1% Total 2,522* * Some comments included more than one theme, increasing the total themed comment count to 2,522 from 2,099 total comments. Shopping Experience The WIC shopping experience was also rated by 7,067 respondents. Fifty one percent reported no problems shopping for WIC foods; however, the remaining 49 percent had one or more issues shopping (e.g., foods not labeled by the store properly, could not find a WIC item, confused over what was allowed). This led to a more intensive follow up and training with WIC vendors. Open Responses All clients were asked if there is anything else they'd like to report about their WIC visit, and 18,400 responses were received. The majority of these sentiments were positive (Table 59, Figure 2). 109 Table 59: Is there anything else you'd like to tell us?

Mental Health Services Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program Youth Services Survey for Families Purpose Since 1997, Texas has conducted an annual survey of customers who receive community- based mental health services about their perceptions of the services they receive. Prior to system reorganization, services were provided by the DSHS Mental Health and Subs tance Abuse Division; these services are now part of HHSC, Behavioral Health Services. When the customers receiving services are age 17 or younger, the parents or guardians receive the Youth Services Survey for Families (YSSF). The purpose of the YSSF is to measure: Parental satisfaction with mental health services received through the state mental health system Parental perception of these services along multiple dimensions, including access to care and outcomes of services Sample and Methods In SFY 2018 a nd SFY 2019 the YSSF survey consisted of 26 items about mental health services the customer received over the past six months. Each question assessed information about a specific topic and was strongly related to a group of other questions about the same topic. The survey questions fell into seven of these groups of related questions, or domains. The domains that comprised the YSSF survey were: Satisfaction (with services) Participation in treatment Cultural sensitivity (of staff) Access (to services) Outco mes (of services) Social connectedness Functioning (of the child) The domains are described in more detail in the findings. 112 Parents/guardians of customers answered each survey question using a five -point Likert scale ranging from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree.\" Survey results focused on the domain \"agreement rates,\" which means the percentage of parents that reported \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" to the items in a domain. The survey was administered in English and Spanish. In both years, a random sample from community mental health centers, local entities that contract with the state to deliver mental health services, was identified to receive the survey requests. 26 In SFY 2018, a total of 2,211 survey invitations were mailed out (9.8 percent of the 22,519 customers served) .27 In SFY 2019,a total of 3,110 survey invitations were mailed out (14.8 percent of the 21,028 customers served).28 In SFY 2018, there were a total of 262 completed questionnaires. The survey had a response rate of 13 percent. In SFY 2019, there were a total of 342 completed questionnaires. The survey had a response rate of 12 percent. Major Findings The results of the two most recent survey years (S FY 2018 and 2019) are shown in Table 60. The percentages indicate the proportion of respondents who answered \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" to questions in the stated domain.29 For instance, 84 percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the items in the Satisfaction domain in SFY 2019 . The majority of domain agreement rates were similar between SFY 2018 and SFY 2019, with SFY 2019 rates being slightly higher than SFY 2018 rates. 26 Community mental health centers are also called Local Mental Health Authorities. For more information, see http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/mhcommunity/default.shtm . 27 There were of 2,211 children/a dolescents in the sample and 143 surveys were undeliverable. 28 There were 3,110 children/a dolescents in the sample and 246 surveys were undeliverable. 29 For each domain, only respondents who answered two -thirds or more of the items comprising that domain were included in the calculation. 113 Table 60: Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program Youth Services Survey for Families: Indicated Strongly Agree or Agree with Domains Domain Description of Domain SFY 2018 Proportion of Respondents * (N = 262) SFY 2019 Proportion of Respondents * (N=342 ) Satisfaction (with services) Would the parent choose these services for his/her child if there were other options available? 80% 84% Participation in Treatment Planning Does the parent feel involved in treatment decisions? 86% 90% Cultural Sensitivity (of staff) Does staff show respect for the family's race/ethnicity/ culture? 90% 94% Access (to services) Are services available when and where needed? 82% 87% Outcomes (of services) As a result of services, has the child's functioning at home and school improved and has he/she experienced fewer mental health symptoms? 59% 59% Social Connectedness Does the child feel connected to friends, family, and community? 76% 80% Functioning Has the child's overall well -being improved? 59% 61% * Proportions indicate respondents who selected choices \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" rather than \"neutral,\" \"disagree,\" or \"strongly disagree.\" 114 Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program Adult Mental Health Survey Purpose The Adult Mental Health (A MH) Survey asks customers who receive community - based mental health services about their perceptions of the services they receive. Prior to system reorganization, services were provided by the DSHS Mental Health and Substance Abuse Division; these services are now part of HHSC, Behavioral Health Services. Adults age 18 years or older who recently received a mental health service beyond an intake assessment are eligible for inclusion in the survey. The purpose of the survey is to measure: Customer satisfaction with mental health services received through the state mental health system Customer perception of these services along multiple dimensions, including access t o care and outcomes of services Sample and Methods In SFY 2018 and SFY 2019, The AMH survey consisted of 36 questions about mental health services the customer received over the past 12 months. Each question assessed information about a specific topic and is strongly related to a group of other questions about the same topic. The survey questions fall into seven of these groups, or domains. The domains that comprise the AMH survey are: Satisfaction (with services) Access Quality and Appropriateness (of services) Participation in Treatment Planning Outcomes (of services) Functioning Social Connectedness The domains are described in more detail in the findings. Customers answered each survey question using a five -point Likert scale ranging from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree.\" Survey results focus on the domain \"agreement rates,\" which means the percentage of parents that reported \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" to the items in a domain. The survey was administered in English and Spanish. 115 In both years, a random sample from community mental health centers was used to identify the survey sample. In SFY 2018, a total of 1,583 survey invitations were mailed out (4.1 percent of the 38,630 customers served) .30 In SFY 2019, a total of 2,286 survey invitations were mailed out (5.9 percent of the 38,433 customers served) .31 In SFY 2018, there were a total of 263 completed questionnaires. The survey had a response rate of 18 percent. In SFY 2019, there were a total of 412 completed questionnaires. The survey had a response rate of 19 percent. Major Findings The results of the two most recent survey yea rs (SFY 2018 and 2019 ) are shown below. The percentages in Table 61 indicate the proportion of respondents who answered \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" to questions in the stated domain.32 For instance, 8 3 percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the items in the Satisfaction domain in SFY 2019 . The majority of domain agreement rates were similar between SFY 2018 and SFY 2019, with SFY 2019 rates being slightly higher than SFY 2018 rates. 30 There were 1,583 adults in the sample and 116 surveys were undeliverable. 31 There were 2,286 adults in the sample and 166 surveys were undeliverable. 32 For each domain, only respondents who answered two -thirds or more of the items comprising that domain were included in the calculation. 116 Table 61: Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program Adult Mental Health Survey: Indicated Strongly Agree or Agree with Domains Domain Description of Domain SFY 2018 Proportion of Respondents * (N = 263) SFY 2019 Proportion of Respondents * (N=412) Satisfaction (with services) Would the consumer choose to receive these services if he or she had other options? 81% 83% Access (to services) Are sufficient services available when and where needed? 75% 79% Quality and Appropriateness (of services) Is staff competent and are the services professional? 80% 84% Participation in Treatment Planning Does the consumer feel involved in treatment decisions? 68% 74% Outcomes (of services) Has the consumer experienced improvement in work, housing, and relationships? 59% 60% Functioning Has 57% 61% Social Connectedness Does the consumer feel connected to friends, family, and community? 65% 63% * Proportions indicate respondents who chose answer choices \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" rather than \"neutral,\" \" disagree,\" o r \"strongly disagree.\" 117 Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program Inpatient Consumer Survey Purpose State psychiatric hospitals located throughout Texas serve people with psychiatric disorders who need services provided in a residential environment. The usual length of stay for civil patients, accounting for about half of the patients in state hospitals, is short. Civil patients usually are treated for a few days or possibly weeks; the focus of services is stab ilization and support of patients' return to the community. Forensic patients generally have a longer length of stay, which is determined by the court, and can vary from about 70 days for a patient on initial restoration commitment, to years for a patient commitment under the Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity commitment. State psychiatric hospitals provide assessment, evaluation, and treatment. Treatment involves a variety of services: psychiatry, nursing, social work, psychology, education/rehabilitation, nutrition, medical, and dental. These services are paid for through general revenue funds from the State of Texas, private payment, private third -party insurance, and Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Inpatient Consumer Survey (ICS) is conducted in compliance with Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program (MHSIP) requirements. The ICS is distributed to every individual age 13 years old or older who is discharged from one of the 10 state psychiatric hospitals. The purpose of this survey is to measure individuals': Experience in the state psychiatric hospital, including their experience with staff, treatment, and the facility Participation in their treatment Ability to function after leaving the hospital Sample and Methods This survey started more than nine years ago. The data reported in this report are from SFY 2018 and SFY 2019 (September 2017 to August 2019). These data were compared to the results from SFY 2016 and SFY 2017. During SFY 2018 and SFY 2019 combined there were 12,366 discharges.33 The response rate widely varies according to setting. Patients in facilities with longer lengths of stay (especially forensic facilities) and more planned discharges had much higher response rates 33 In SFY 2016 and SFY 2017 combined there were 15,596 discharges. 118 than civil facilities where patients left very quickly and are often discharged by court, leaving the day of the court decision. Averaging all of these facilities, the response rate has been between 36 and 38 percent from SFY 2014 - SFY 2017 and around 42 percent for S FY 2018 and SFY 2019. The survey population was adolescents and adults served in the state psychiatric hospitals. Data were collected at 10 state psychiatric hospitals: Austin State Hospital Big Spring State Hospital El Paso Psychiatric Center Kerrville State Hospital Rio Grande State Center Rusk State Hospital San Antonio State Hospital Terrell State Hospital North Texas State Hospital Waco Center for Youth The ICS was conducted using a convenience sampling method. When a decision was made to discharge a patient, the patient was given an opportunity to complete the survey. This process could begin as early as three or more days prior to discharge. Patients could also be given an envelope so that the completed survey could be mailed back to the quality assurance division of the facility after discharge. The likelihood of a returned survey was greater prior to the customer leaving the facility. Patients with hospital episodes greater than one year were given a survey to complete during each annual review. The survey was offered on paper and was available in English and Spanish. The total number of surveys received was estimated due to the fact that not all facilities participate in all of the domains and duplicate surveys are removed at multiple points in the process. In SFY 2018, approximately 2,758 surveys were collected, and in SFY 2019, approximately 2,512 surveys were collected. The survey includes questions about five topics, or domains, as shown in Table 62. 119 Table 62: Domains Measured in Mental Health Statistics Improvement Domain Description of Domain Outcome Effect of the hospital stay on the customer's ability to deal with their illness and with social situations Dignity Quality of interactions between staff and customers that highlight a respectful relationship Rights Ability of customers to express disapproval with conditions or treatment and receive an appropriate response from the organization Participation in Treatm ent Customers' involvement in their hospital treatment as well as coordination with the customers' doctor or therapist from the community Facility Environment Feeling safe in the facility and the aesthetics of the facility Major Findings In general, high- level monitoring of adolescent and adult satisfaction with state psychiatric hospitals relie d on an average overall score, which encompasses answers to survey questions in all five domains. In both SFY 2018 and SFY 2019, this annual average score target was exceeded by all 10 state psychiatric hospitals and showed little change from the scores in SFY 2016 and SFY 2017. Client satisfaction was fairly consistent across all five domains. There were noticeable increases to d ignity scores and ri ghts continued to be lower than the other domains. An increase in forensic population with a longer length of stay and fewer discharges were contributing factors in having fewer surveys returned but a noted increase in the rate of return. Results for SFY 2018 and SFY 2019 are provided in Table 63. 120 Table 63: Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program Inpatient Customer Survey: Positive Responses to Domains Domain SFY 2018* Proportion of Respondents** (N=2,758 )*** SFY 2019 * Proportion Respondents** 78.6% 77.8% 75.2% Facility Environment 73.7% 75.1% * The SFY 2018 survey was conducted from September 201 7 to August 2018. The SFY 2019 survey w as conducted from September 2018 to August 2019. ** Each question in the ICS is evaluated on a Likert scale from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree.\" For purposes of computing averages, a number value is given to the qualities of the scale from 1 for \"strongly disagree\" to 5 for \"strongly agree.\" A c lient must respond to a minimum of two questions in a domain in order for an average rating to be computed for th e domain. Since there are only three to four questions in a domain, missing values are not inserted when a client does not answer a question. When the average rating for the questions in the domain is greater than 3.5, the client is considered to have \"responded positively\" to the domain. The proportion of clients who responded positively to the domain is the percent of clients who responded posi tively out of all clients who responded to the domain. *** Not all facilities ask questions for each domain. The N listed is the approximate number of surveys collected. House Bill 13 Community Mental Health Grant Program Purpose House Bill 13, 85th Texas Legislature, Regular Session, 2017 (HB 13) appropriated funds for a grant program for community mental health services to support communities in the provision of treatment and the coordination of mental health services. HB 13 appropriated a total of $10 mi llion across SFY 2018 and SFY 2019. Through the grant program, about 70 local mental health authorities, universities, counties, and large non- profits receive grants to provide innovative mental health 121 services to clients.34 Each grant can have a different focus, such as substance abuse, comorbid conditions, access to care, or criminal justice issues. The purpose of these grants is to: Support community programs that provide mental healthcare services and treatment to individuals with a mental illness Coordinate menta l health care services for individuals who have a mental illness with other transition support services HB 13 require s that HHSC report on client satisfaction for SFY 2019 after the final grants were distributed. To measure satisfaction, the Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program Adult Mental Health (AMH) and Youth Services Survey for Families (YSSF) is used. 35 Each of these surveys asks respondents to indicate their perceptions of the mental health services they received. The purpose of each survey is to measure: Customer satisfaction with mental health services received through the state mental health system . Customer perception of these services along multiple dimensions, including access to care and outcomes of services. Sample and Me thods In SFY 2019, the AMH survey consisted of 36 questions about mental health services the customer received over the past 12 months. The YSSF survey consisted of 26 items about mental health services the customer received over the past six months. Each question assessed information about a specific topic and is strongly related to a group of other questions about the same topic. The survey questions fall into seven of these groups, or domains. The domains that comprise the AMH survey were : Satisfaction with services Access to services 34 Some sites could receive multiple grants. 35 The Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program AMH and YSSF surveys are annual surveys for customers receiving community -based mental health services in Texas. HB 13 administered the same survey questions to individuals receiving mental health services from community programs that were recipients of grant funds. Although the projects were distinct and the desired populations of each were different, there may be some overlap in respondents among the MHSIP and the HB 13 samples. 122 Participation in treatment planning Outcomes of services Functioning (of the consumer) Social Connectedness Quality and appropriateness of services (AMH only) Cultural sensitivity of staff (YSSF only) The domains are described in more detail in the findings. Customers answered each survey question using a five -point Likert scale ranging from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree \".36 Survey results focused on the domain \"agreement rates,\" which indicate the percentage of parents that reported \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" to the items in a domain. The survey was administered in English and Spanish. Surveys were administered to a convenience sample of customers receiving services at each of the grantee sites during April 2019. All surveys were conducted online. Providers distributed an online link to the surveys to clients. Clients ages 18 years of age and older receiving services from providers of adult mental health services were provided the link to the AMH surveys. Clients ages 19 years of age and younger receiving services from providers of youth and family services were provided the link to the YSSF surveys.37 Providers encouraged survey participation by offering for the client to complete the survey on- site or suggesting the c lient complete the survey off -site on a mobile device or computer.38 There was a total of 582 responses for the AMH surveys. There was a total of 728 responses for the YSSF surveys. Major Findings The results are shown below. The percentages in Table 64 indicate the proportion of respondents who answered \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" to questions in the stated 36 For YSSF surveys, parents/guardians of customers answered survey questions unless a client was old enough to complete it on their own. 37 Some youth and family providers may offer services to young adults ages 18 and 19. 38 Providers were not required to of fer on -site options for survey completion. Data was not collected on which providers offered this option or how many clients completed surveys on or off -site from their service providers. 123 domain.39 For instance, 97 percent of AMH respondents and 88 percent of YSSF respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the items in the Satisfaction domain. 39 For each domain, only respondents who answered two -thirds or more of the items comprising that domain were included in the calculation. 124 Table 64: HB 13 Community Health Grant Program Customer Satisfaction AMH and YSSF Surveys: Indicated Strongly Agree or Agree with Domains Domain Description of Domain AMH Proportion of Respondents* (N=582) YSSF Proportion of Respondents* (N=7 28) Satisfaction with services Would the consumer choose to receive these services if he or she had other options? 97% 88% Access to services Are sufficient services available when and where needed? 95% 86% Participation in treatment planning Does the consumer feel involved in treatment decisions? 90% 76% Outcomes of services Has the consumer experienced improvement in work, housing, and relationships? 83% 81% Functioning Has 83% 81% Social Connectedness Does the consumer feel connected to friends, family, and community? 86% 89% Quality and Appropriateness of services (AMH only) Is staff competent and are the services professional? 95% N/A Cultural Sensitivity of staff (YSSF only) Does show respect for the family's race/ethnicity/ culture?

Disability Services Intellectual and Developmental Disability Services Survey and Disability Services Survey Purpose Texas HHS is developing an action plan to improve the system and delivery of services for Texans with physical, intellectual, or developmental disabilities. To support the disability services action plan, the Office of Mental Health Coordination (OMHC) developed the 2018 Intellectual and Developmental Disability Services Survey and the 2019 Disability Services Survey to engage and obtain input from stakeholders within the disability community on services and experiences while navigating programs in H HS. The 2018 survey focused on people with intellectual and developmental disabilities whereas the 2019 survey focused on all types of disabilities to fulfill the expanded information needs of HHS. These surveys are administered by HHSC CADS in collaborati on with OMHC and with feedback from the Intellectual and Developmental Disability System Redesign Advisory Committee. Sample and Method s The study sought responses from the target population of individuals engaged with disability service s including : (1) individuals with disability, (2) their family members, (3) individuals providing services and support to these populations, and (4) the staff of organizations and agencies that serve these populations . The sample was developed by OMHC as a convenience sample gathered from a communication campaign that included promotion through public advertisement, social media, web sites, and key disability stakeholder organizations . The study was collected using an online survey link in September 2018 targeted to members of the intellectual and developmental disability community and again in September 2019 targeted to all individuals with disability . The survey was offered in English only. Individuals provided their responses by completing the survey using either a computer or mobile device. The number of completed responses for the 2018 survey was 3,217 out of 4,958 individuals that started surveys , for a completion rate of 64.8%. The 2019 survey returned 2,890 completed surveys out of 4,340 started surveys for a completion 126 rate of 66.6%. Analysis for the 2019 survey was conducted exclusively on IDD involved respondents, and among those respondents , 2,268 individuals completed the survey for a response rate of 80.4%. Survey questions were grouped into sets of statements about different topics in disability service with respondents being asked to rate their agreement on a four- point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree with the option to mark questions as not applicable. To analyze the survey each individual was assigned a satisfaction score for every topic of disability service for which they provided feedback. Satisfaction score s represented the average response of all rated questions for each area of disability service standardized on a scal e from 0-100 with higher scores representing greater satisfactio n. Major Findings General findings from the two survey s found opportunities to improve across most areas of disability service for all types of respondents . The specific findings were generate d from analysis of the average satisfaction score for different groups of respondents and are summarized in Table 65 and Table 66. Two differences between how the surveys were collected may explain large ye ar-to-year differences in scores. In the 2018 survey, respondents were asked to identify areas of improvement in IDD services and provided feedback on all areas of IDD service regardless of personal experience. In the 2019 Survey respondents were asked to provide general feedback on disability services but only for those services they had received within the last year. 127 Table 65: IDD Services Survey: Average Satisfaction Scores by Respondent Type for IDD Involved Respondents for IDD Services Topic Areas Family and Friends (N=974) Service Providers (N=933) Agency and Organization Staff (N=1,159) Employment Services 20.7 33.1 35.1 Housing Services 19.6 38.3 41.0 Transportation Services 28.4 39.5 40.7 Crisis Services 24.6 41.3 43.1 Service Access 30.1 40.4 40.5 Provider Service Coordination 27.7 41.5 43.2 Family Support 30.9 41.4 42.6 Behavioral Health Services 32.6 46.8 48.2 State Coordination 33.5 50.6 51.7 Evidence Based Practices 36.6 51.3 51.0 52.1 60.1 58.4 Overall 30.6 44.0 45.0 Source: 2018 Disability Services Survey Notes: Index scores range from 0 -100, higher scores indicate higher overall satisfaction .

Total possible respondents are 2, 411. Questions on evidence- based practice were not presented to family or friend respondents. Questions on transportation were not asked in 2019. Family and friend respondents were limited to services that the individual they support have engaged. Group level differences were significant for all domains (p<.001) except for evidence- based practices. 129 4. Conclusion This HHS system -wide 2020 Report on Cus tomer Service describes the results of nearly 289,132 individual survey responses from 31 surveys conducted by the two Texas agencies belonging to the Texas Health and Human Services (HHS) system during the S FY 2018- 2019 reporting period. Surveyed individuals were primarily direct consumers of services and enrollees in health plans; other surveys solicited feedback from entities r egulated or inspected by HHS, service providers contracted with HHS, entities receiving HHS laboratory services, and community st akeholders. Fourteen projects surveyed customers of HHS services, including families of children with special needs, developmental delays, or disabilities; adults with disabilities; children and adults who received mental health services ; elderly individu als residing in care facilities; clients attending immunization clinics ; SNAP applicants; customers of eligibility offices; and customers of complaint intake offices. The largest of these surveys, the YourTexasBenefits.com survey, collected over 5,000 responses per month, on average. Overall, most respondents provided positive feedback regarding the services and supports received through HHS programs. Enrollees in STAR, STAR Health, STAR+PLUS, and CHIP health plans were surveyed through 10 different surveys. Respondents included families or caregivers of enrolled children, as well as enrolled adults. Across these surveys, most quality components were rated positively. Respondents were most likely to give positive feedback on domains related to communication with doctors, shared decision making, and customer service; one domain with opportunities for improvement is acce ss to specialized services . Texas's External Quality Review Organization provides more detailed findings and recommendations from member surve ys in their annual Summary of Activities Report . Four surveys collected responses from customers of state laboratory services, including submitters to the South Texas Laboratory and customers of the Laboratory Courier Program. Surveys showed broad satisfaction related to transit time, staff responsiveness, and quality of service . Three surveys were conducted to obtain feedback from entities inspected by the state. A wide range of businesses, healthcare facilities, food service facilities, and other regulated organizations provided positive feedback on state services, including inspections, site reviews, and communication with staff. 130 Overall, the HHS system of agencies has succeeded in obtaining feedback from a diverse group of customers. Although m ost respondents provided positive feedback regarding the services and supports received through HHS programs , some surveys identified opportunities for improvement. Feedback identifying opportunities for improvement is used to inform how services are provided in the future. For example, feedback collected from health plan enrollees is used to hold managed care organizations accountable through HHSC quality programs. These results support the HHS system mission of improving the health, safety, and well -being of Texans through good stewardship of public resources. A-1 Appendix A.
