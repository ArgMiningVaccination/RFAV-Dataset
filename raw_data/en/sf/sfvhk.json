Naturopaths are trained specialists in a separate and distinct healing art which uses non-invasive natural medicine. They are not orthodox medical doctors (M.D.s). Naturopathic doctors (N.D.s) are conventionally trained in subjects such as anatomy, physiology, counseling, dietary evaluations, nutrition, herbology, acupressure, muscle relaxation and structural normalization, homeopathy, iridology, exercise therapy, hydrotherapy, and oxygen therapy. Naturopaths tailor the healing modality of the needs of the individual with methods which are effective for both chronic and acute problems. Naturopaths cooperate will all branches of medical science, referring individuals to other practitioners for diagnosis or treatment when appropriate. In practice, Naturopaths perform lifestyle analysis, laboratory testing, nutritional and dietary assessments, metabolic analysis, and other evaluative procedures. They are trained to use a wide variety of natural methods which involve the individual in the healing process. Naturopathy is based upon a belief in the body's innate natural ability to heal itself when given an appropriate internal and external healing environment. Naturopath's are not involved in the practice of medicine and do not use drugs or pharmaceuticals, nor do they perform surgery (other than minor first aid). They have been traditionally referred to as \"drugless doctors\". In reality, Naturopathy deals with wellness and relief from conditions which are the result of stress whether from mental, nutritional, environmental, or physical factors. Naturopath's treat the cause not the symptom, when the cause of the illness turns to wellness the symptom goes away. \"Naturopathy is first instructive, then inspiration, and ultimately growth. Naturopathy, with all its various treatments, has always one end in view and one end only: to increase the vital force.\" -Dr. Benedict Lust, is considered to be \"the father of naturopathy\" in the U.S.A. Naturopathy was the earliest known healing system. Before surgery and synthetic isolation of chemical substances, foods, water, and whole herbs were used by many cultures for a wide range of problems. The Chinese for example used kelp 3,000 years ago for thyroid health. The ancient Egyptians used liver for night blindness [2]. Native American (as well as most other) cultures used various herbs to promote healing. Various forms of hydrotherapy have been used by many cultures (Egyptians, Chinese, Hebrews, Greeks, Assyrians, Persians, Hindus, etc.) for thousands of years. Excavations of ancient ruins, especially after the work carried on in Egypt, disclose the fact that disease was treated by fasting, purging, emetics, sweats- all with the very evident aim of assisting Nature to unload encumbering waste that was plainly causing the disorder. It seems that the accepted teachings in the manner of the care of the will were very similar to our present methods of naturopathy, being in line with Nature's indicated efforts during illness. Naturopathic practitioners are not medical doctors, should employ only those modalities that are natural, and should not perform surgery or write prescriptions. Naturopathy is not the practice of medicine or surgery. All the methods of a Naturopath are natural methods, the agents of life such as food, air, sun, exercise, relaxation, sleep, and use of herbs. We believe that... - The body under normal natural conditions is a self-sustaining organism. - The theory of health and disease is based on Nature itself. - The body is governed by definite natural laws with regard to the physical, chemical, biological and physiological basis. - Ill health is, therefore, as a result of a departure, from healthful living out of harmony with Nature's laws. - To the degree that man adheres to and applies Nature's beneficial laws, to that degree will the body, through its natural inherent powers restore itself to normal. - Naturopathy is a philosophy, art and science and recognizes the body's inherent processes of healing, and acts in no way to suppress, antagonize or hinder these vital life forces, but, rather to arouse, assist and cooperate with the body to a restoration to normal. - To this end Naturopathy proceeds as follows; it makes use of the healing properties of such natural agencies as air, sunshine, water, light, heat, electricity, manipulations, rest, natural vital foods, organic vitamins, organic minerals, herbs in conjunction with cleansing and eliminating processes of other physical and mental cultures. - Naturopathy does not make use of synthetic or inorganic vitamins or minerals or of drugs, narcotics, surgery, serums, vaccines, anti-toxins, toxoid, injections and inoculations. - Naturopathy also provides for the prevention of disease and the preservation of health by teaching the basic fundamental laws of natural living and the application in daily life. Naturopaths believe that each individual is responsible for making decisions about his/her own health. Naturopathic doctors do not prescribe treatments for disease. They educate (the word doctor means teacher) their clients about natural health. However, the reality is that not all individuals are willing to shoulder responsibilities for their own health and thus not all individuals are ready for naturopathy. "}
