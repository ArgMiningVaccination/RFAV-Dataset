{"title": "Studies in Anthroposophy - Still time to join us this afternoon! March 3 - Anthroposophic Medicine - Dan Einstein, MD The Fifth in the Series of Living in Harmony with the Life Forces of Earth - an exploration of some of the works arising from the insights of Rudolf Steiner's spiritual science 2:30 - 4:30 pm at Ashwood Waldorf School, Lower Grade School Building Dr. Einstein is an integrative family medicine doctor practicing in Freeport and Rockport, Maine. Dr. Einstein began his journey in medicine in 2000 by volunteering at free clinics in the San Francisco area. Finding that he loved both conventional and holistic medicine, he trained as an herbalist at the Blue Otter School and then went on to medical school at Case Western in Cleveland, Ohio. He met his wife there, and both of them came back to New England for residency training at Maine-Dartmouth in Augusta. He is now board certified in Family Medicine, Integrative Medicine, and Anthroposophic medicine. He lives with his wife, daughter and several animals in Freeport. Website: holistic-einstein.com In the modern world we are bombarded with advice on lifestyle changes that can improve our health. Much of this advice conflicts with the increasing demands of work and constant connectivity. In an effort to resolve this tension, Dr Einstein will review the fourfold human (physical, etheric, astral and I) and lead a discussion of health-giving practices to support each one. Many of these practices will be familiar to participants but understanding their interaction with the fourfold can deepen their significance. Additionally, this understanding allows the practices to be modified to suit the realities of each person's life. After the large group discussion, we will break into small groups to discuss how our own health practices might improve from this knowledge. In preparation for this class, please feel free to write down your own health practices and what they mean to you. Artistic Exercises as part of the class Sarah Williams Smith will lead us in the Moral Color Exercises, a series of six paintings based on a 1915 lecture by Rudolf Steiner. These color exercises work as a cleansing, reorientation of the soul, helping us reharmonize ourselves when faced with the modern forces of materialism, overscheduling and disconnection from the spiritual world. 2:30 4:30 pm this afternoon, March 3 Lower Grade School - Ashwood Waldorf School, 180 Park Street, Rockport, ME 04856 Tuition -$30, Click here to register at http://anthroposophystudies.tumblr.com/ or just come in and meet Bridget, our registrar, who will be happy to welcome you! | Facebook", "author": null, "url": "https://www.facebook.com/AshwoodWaldorf/photos/a.595584260458814/2674980099185876/", "hostname": "facebook.com", "description": "Still time to join us this afternoon!
