However, the vaccines developed to date provide this protection only to a certain extent4. They do offer more vulnerable people wit h pre -existing conditions and of advanced age temporary protection against severe cases of disease. However, they can neither prevent the occurrence of the disease nor a possible infection of others in the long term. In addition, the side effects that have become known so far are more frequent than we know from conventional vaccines , especially in younger people.5 Therefore, we consider an individual risk -benefit assessment to be indispensable. Hospitals operated for profit quickly reach their capacity li mits The indirect threat to the population posed by overloading the health care system must be countered by increasing capacity. Compared with the restrictions on civil liberties and the prospect of compulsory vaccination, this is a more proportionate, pat ient-oriented and sustainable option. Self-responsibility and freedom of conscience promote resilience and joy in life We know from salutogenesis, resilience, and psychoneuroimmunological research that people with an inner value system, optimistic outlook on life, and religious or spiritual orientation have stronger resilience resources. Fear and compulsion, on the other hand, are associated with emotions that undermine resilience. Therefore, everyone, but especially those who work in health care and are t hus exposed to higher risks, should be allowed to decide freely and self -determinedly for or against a COVID -19 vaccination - especially since this vaccination can only protect to a limited extent. Individualism in the field of tension between egoism and conformism. Our appeal is for the preservation of the central European values of freedom, solidarity and dignity, which we see endangered by the currently discussed compulsory vaccination against COVID -19. In view of this threat, it is gratifying that the Council of Europe adopted a resolution on January 27, 2021, opposing mandatory COVID -19 vaccination. It also seeks to ensure \"that no one is discriminated against because they are not vaccinated, because they may have a health risk, or because they do not want to be vaccinated.\"6 Ladies and gentlemen, we call upon you to decide against a compulsory COVID -19 vaccination and in favor of more individual self -responsibility.
