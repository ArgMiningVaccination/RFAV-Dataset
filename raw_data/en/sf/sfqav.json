Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on May 08, 2019 Energy healing is a treatment often sought for illnesses and imbalances that are not always easily explained. When our physical bodies are injured we can see the blood oozing from our injuries. When our bones become broken we can look at the fractures on x-rays. The human body is more than flesh, blood, and bones. Misalignments of our subtle energies (human energy field, aura, and chakras) are not as easily diagnosed because these energies are invisible to the human eye. When these invisible energies become misaligned our dis-eases are not as easily diagnosed. But there are people we can turn to for help. Medical intuitives can sense energetic imbalances in our bodies. Also, energy healers who are studied in various energy-based therapies have been trained in clearing, redirecting, or manipulating these energies to ease and treat dis-eases. How Healers Work With Energy Energy healing practitioners will use their hands either by hands-on contact, hovering, or making sweeping hand movements above or around the body. The same techniques energy healers use in-person can also be carried out through distance healing. How energy treatments are conducted will vary according to modality being used. Also, healers themselves are unique in how they work with energy in their healing practices. This is because many energy medicine practitioners have acquired a variety of tools by attending several different schools and workshops to learn about energy healing. How they incorporate these acquired tools makes them unique. Focus and Intention Basically, distance healing is done with focus and intent. There are several energy-based therapies that can be conducted remotely in this manner. These include Reiki Healing, Quantum Touch, Chios Energy Healing, and Domancic Bioenergy. There are also two lesser known therapies (Ama-Deus and Tong Ren) that utilize absentia techniques. Ama-Deus Healing Technique Ama Deus (pronounced Ah-mah Day-yus) is Latin for \"to love God.\" Ama-Deus originates from the Guaranis Indians, a native culture of people living in the Amazon jungle in South America. The founder of Ama-Des is Alberto Aguas, a Brazilan healer who studied the Guarani Indians' way of healing for eight years. He began teaching Ama-Deus in a classroom setting in 1982 until his death in 1992. Ama-Deus is a method of hands-on and absentia energy healing that promotes spiritual growth and awareness. It is also a means to support our physical and emotional bodies. This healing modality is taught in two levels. Students are taught a ceremonial invocation that connects them to the flow of Ama Deus energy. Students also learn sacred symbols that are utilized in conducting Ama-Deus healing sessions.

Tong Ren Therapy is a part of the larger Tom Tam Healing System which utilizes acupuncture, qigong, and tuina for healing. Tom Tam and senior students of Tong Ren offer multiple training seminars every year. Typically used as a form of distance healing, Tong Ren techniques are applied to an acupuncture doll as a focusing tool utilizing the collective unconscious. The Tong Ren practitioner will focus his intention on the physical locations on the doll which correspond with the same locations on the recipient's body needing treatment. Focus is placed wherever chi is disconnected or blocked. The doll serves as a surrogate for the person receiving treatment. Various types of tools are utilized to tap, poke, or otherwise stimulate imbalances. These intentional actions stimulate the body and help to restore balance and vitality to the recipient. Tong Ren Tools: Magnetic Hammer - Tapping stimulation of blockage points. Laser Beam - Focusing light and heat on tumor areas. Pins - Inserting pins or acupuncture needles. Tens Machine - Low dosage electrical impulse stimulation. Disk or Dish - Disking requires the participation of at least three people. Fingertips are placed on the disk over the Ouch Point similarly to how you would use an Ouija board planchette.
