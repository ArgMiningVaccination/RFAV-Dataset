Wakefield is a former British doctor who has become an anti-vaccine activist. Bigtree said he left his career as a producer to focus all of his attention on what he calls a story of corruption and deception indicating that the CDC manipulated data on their MMR study. Today, Bigtree travels the nation, meeting with politicians and parents who support freedom of choice in the vaccination debate. He is among those calling for more vaccine research, and he also hosts HighWire Talk, a podcast. In August, Bigtree will talk about discovering and interpreting research on the Salutogenic/chiropractic model of care, including alternatives to pharmaceutical approaches, in his talk, Salutogenesis, Chiropractic & Optimal Health. See Bigtree at The WAVE 2019, Life Chiropractic College West's annual chiropractic conference. The conference will be held from Aug. 16-18 at the Oakland Marriott City Center in Oakland, California. This year's conference theme is The Science, Philosophy and Art of Chiropractic: The Salutogenic Model. Come for discussions on how the Salutogenic model fits with the natural, drug-free chiropractic lifestyle and learn more about how to frame the Salutogenic model and what chiropractic has to offer.
