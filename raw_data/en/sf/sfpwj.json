Incorporating an Art Therapy program is important to help ease feelings of anxiety and depression and help intrigue the mind, engage the body and lift peoples spirits. It creates a gateway for self-discovery Artistic expression leads to the acknowledgement of feelings and ideas that seniors may have not even known they had. [According to Resources to Recover](https://www.rtor.org/2018/07/10/benefits-of-art-therapy/), \"Creating art can help you acknowledge and recognize feelings that have been lurking in your subconscious.\" Art therapy can have a huge benefit on the mental health of seniors because it helps provide them with a method to express these subconscious feelings in a productive way. It offers a sense of accomplishment One of the best ways to help individuals struggling with feelings of depression is by providing them with a sense of accomplishment. One of the easiest and most effective ways to do that is to provide art therapy for seniors. [BeBrainFit notes that art therapy](https://bebrainfit.com/benefits-art/) \"relieves burdensome stress... and provides a sense of accomplishment.\" A sense of accomplishment can go a long way in relieving feelings of depression and anxiety and art therapy can help provide that while distracting seniors from negative feelings during this difficult time of the year.

Many people can benefit from this healing property of art therapy, especially during the holiday season and over the cold winter months. Creating an art piece from scratch has a variety of therapeutic elements especially for older adults. [GoodTherapy even goes so fa](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/self-portrait-for-the-soul-how-i-healed-with-art-therapy-013115)r as to refer to art therapy as a \"self-portrait for the soul.\" It provides a variety of good mental health practices Holidays can trigger toxic habits for mental health such as focusing on how quickly time has passed or all the people may have been lost over the years.

We focus on enhancing both the mind and body which are invaluable to senior citizens. Our Director of Program Development & Training, Rachel Helfand, notes that, \"All of our residents are provided with success oriented activities based on their abilities and interests. This allows them to express their feelings through the stroke of a paint brush. By incorporating these therapeutic activities we are able to build a deeper connection with our residents. \" Art therapy proves that expression comes in all different shapes and sizes, and all of them are valuable in their own way. [Music Therapy](https://www.musictherapy.org/about/quotes/) is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program The benefits of listening to music are well documented in studies, showing clear advantages to an individual's mental and emotional health. From infant development to senior care, music can evoke emotional responses to stimulate the mind and heal the body. Music Therapy can have positive effects on people with various health issues including depression, dementia, sleep and stress. Mental benefits Music Therapy can be a really effective way of depression treatment. The use of music therapy is seen as one of the most beneficial to people with depression when combined with other depression treatments such as antidepressants. Some elderly people experience agitation and emotional stress, especially when they feel like they are losing their mental faculties. Playing soothing music has calming effects, helping to improve emotional health. Music can encourage social interaction as well, especially if played in groups. Social and communication benefits Maintaining social contact with others can be extremely important for seniors, especially if they suffer from depression. Interacting with caregivers and other residents can encourage bonding with others which can help lift spirits and reduce the feeling of loneliness. Music Therapy can also help with communication. Our caregivers have noticed that even when someone is no longer able to speak, they still recognize songs from their past, and even sing or hum along. Physical Benefits Musical Therapy can also be physically beneficial. It can lower blood pressure, improve respiration, reduce heart rate, relax the muscles, and improve cardiac output. The rhythm of music can help physical coordination when walking or exercising. You can help elderly loved ones develop more endurance and increase their mobility, even if it's just toe tapping or clapping along. At Spring Hills, we make sure that our seniors' days are filled with joy and music, because to us, health care is not just physical; it is mental and emotional as well. We've organized sing-alongs and hosted special musical events. Some of our classes even have mood music playing in the background so they can sit back, relax and experience the benefits of music therapy. It is no secret that there are many benefits to interacting with pets like: dogs, cats, birds and robotic simulating animals. Our furry friends are a part of the family and have therapeutic attributes that can improve the health and quality of life for you or your loved ones. [Pet therapy](https://www.healthline.com/health/pet-therapy) is the interaction between a person and a trained animal. We all experience the calm sensation we get when petting man's best friend. Bonding with a friendly pet can help with a variety of physical and mental issues. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4248608/) indicate that those who spend regular time with pets often have lower blood pressure and triglyceride counts. Pet therapy has been utilized in places like senior facilities to promote healthy living, healing, mental health, stability and more. Pet therapy has been scientifically proven to be extremely effective. Studies have shown being around pets releases endorphins and provides a calming effect that people of all ages long for. Here are some additional reasons why pet therapy is beneficial for seniors. Increases social interaction Pet Therapy for individuals with Alzheimer's and Dementia have shown positive results, especially when dogs are present. [ A study conducted at the Veterans Hospital](https://www.petcoach.co/article/psychological-emotional-social-benefits-of-animals/) presented, \"Residents had more verbal interactions with each other when a dog was present in the room than when there was no dog present.\" Additionally for people with dementia pet therapy can be soothing for those that have trouble speaking. Pets can also be a great way to start up conversations and can bridge the gap between people of all ages. According to [Harvard Health Publishing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/pets-can-help-their-humans-create-friendships-find-social-support-201505067981) \"Pets may also indirectly improve health by fostering social connections, which are good for long-term health. [An analysis of 148 studies on the topic](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316) found that people who have solid social networks are 50% more likely to live longer than those with limited social networks. In today's go-it-alone world, many people have trouble making connections.\" Exercise Partner [Exercising ](http://www.renaissancehcs.com/blogs/three-benefits-of-therapeutic-activities-for-seniors/)not only assists seniors who are recovering from an injury or illness, but can also prevent several chronic diseases from arising. [Physical activity](http://www.elpasoinc.com/elpasoplus/health/how-recreation-benefits-seniors/article_937ecf3a-8ebb-11e3-9cae-0017a43b2370.html) can improve appetite, sleep and mood, helps maintain weight, as well as reduce stress and anxiety.

The [physical benefits](https://www.uclahealth.org/pac/animal-assisted-therapy) also include diminishing overall physical pain, releases hormones such as Phenylethylamine, which makes you more relaxed, and slows down things like breathing if you experience anxiety. In a [NCBI study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4248608/), \"Dog owners in Canada were more likely to visit multiuse or walk-through parks than individuals who did not possess dogs.\" Comparatively, cats tend to enjoy playtime throughout the day, which helps their elderly owner to stay engaged and active. Provides a Sense Of Purpose It is common for the elderly population to have symptoms of depression and isolate themselves from family and social outings. [Studies ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4248608/)have shown that pet therapy has the ability to reduce those symptoms of depressions and loneliness. Pets provide a sense of purpose because they depend on their owners for food, exercise, and companionship. Taking care of a pet can be a big responsibility and require a daily regimen which can provide structure to the owner's day. According to [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27858512), \"responsibility is widely considered important in mental health recovery.\" At [Spring Hills](https://www.springhills.com/), our care providers have witnessed just how much having a pet enhances the lives and joy of those in our care. Pet therapy allows people to interact, socialize and engage routinely. Our goal is to enhance our seniors lives by nurturing the mind, body and spirit through our programs, therapies and other [Signature Touch Programs](http://www.renaissancehcs.com/signature-touches/). [Horticultural therapy](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/03/health/sw-horticultural-therapy#:~:text=Horticultural%20therapy%20is%20a%20professional,addiction%20and%20mental%20health%20problems.) is a professional practice that uses plants and gardening to improve mental and physical health. For those who love gardening, there is perhaps nothing more relaxing than the feeling of fresh soil between your fingers. A passion for many seniors, the benefits of gardening don't stop at bountiful produce and beautiful blooms. Gardening has proven therapeutic for reducing physical pain and stress levels and boosting your overall quality of life. The practice of connecting with the earth \u2014 planting flowers and vegetables, getting your hands dirty, and watching your efforts turn into beautiful results \u2014 provides a sense of empowerment that too often vanishes with age. Physical Therapy Planting, daily pruning and watering, or even just a walk through the garden can help you stay physically well \u2014 promoting muscle movement, coordination, heart and lung health and flexibility.
