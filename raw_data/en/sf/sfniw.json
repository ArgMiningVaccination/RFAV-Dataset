Shilajit is one of the sought after Ayurvedic product in the market. From body building, to treating disorders such as diabetes, asthma etc, shilajat is very commonly used. Table of Contents Traditional belief In ancient times, the mountains getting heated due to strong sun rays of Jeshta and ashada months (Summer) melt the layers of the mountain, yielding a resin kind of semisolid liquid, Shilajathu. This resembles coal tar in consistency and upon drying it gains shine. It readily dissolves in water. It is considered as Fulvic acid. Fulvic acid Fulvic acid is a semisolid substance that is created as organic matter decomposes. Fulvic acids is a mixture of organic acids, herbal, metallic compounds, and components of the humus (which is a fraction of soil organic matter). Research has also found that Shilajit is the resin obtained from an herb called Asphaltum punjabinum. Hence Silajitu is called Asphaltum in Sanskrit. So, asphaltum and fulvic acid - both these are used in the name of Shilajit. Availability It is available in hilly areas Kashmir, Japan, Bhutan, Tibet and Gilgit.

Shilajit vs Gold vs Copper for Cholesterol Treatment Shilajit vs. Swarna Bhasma vs. Tamra Bhasma for Cholesterol Management Answer by Dr JV Hebbar For decreasing cholesterol, to pierce through the blood vessels afflicted with plaques, you would need something which is hot, strong, sharp and piercing. Swarna Bhasma or Gold Calx is coolant, but it does not have that strong, hot and piercing qualities. It is explained as Hrudya - good for the heart. It acts as a cardiac tonic and improves heart functioning but not particularly good for cholesterol management. Read: [Swarna Bhasma Benefits, Dosage, Ingredients, Side Effects, Preparation](https://www.ayurmedinfo.com/2012/07/08/swarna-bhasma-benefits-dosage-ingredients-side-effects-preparation/) Tamra Bhasma - Copper calx is hot, strong, piercing. it is explained in Rasa Tarangini textbook as - Lekhana - scrapes the inner channels, useful in cholesterol deposits (atherosclerosis). It is also explained as Sthoulya Dhwamsakara - Meaning, it reduces the body fat tissue. So, it is useful both in obesity and cholesterol management. But Tamra bhasma can be very poisonous and should be used with utmost precaution. Old Tamra bhasma tends to lose its qualities and it is usually not used alone, but in combination with other mineral and herbal ingredients. So, rather than using Tamra bhasma, copper vessel stored water is a good choice for daily use, for people with obesity and high cholesterol. Once you store the water in a copper vessel, you have to empty it within 12 hours. Do not store it over a period of more than 24 days. Read: [Tamra Bhasma - Benefits, Dosage, Ingredients, Side Effects](https://www.ayurmedinfo.com/2012/07/02/tamra-bhasma-benefits-dosage-ingredients-side-effects/) Considering the above context, Shilajit is a clear winner. It is safer than Tamra bhasma, more effective to reduce cholesterol, when compared to Swarna Bhasma. Shilajit is pungent, spicy bitter, hot undergoes pungent transformation in the body, Rasayana chedi - breaks down toxins, cholesterol deposits, plaques, opens up body channels yogavaha - acts as a catalyst One more advantage with Shilajit usage is, it is good for improving strength, stamina and muscle building.

They both improve muscle and nerve strength and help to burn fat at the same time. So, this combination is useful for losing weight, for people who regularly do Yoga, gym, sports people etc. Both are natural aphrodisiacs. So, men can use it for improving performance. Shilajit is extremely useful to improve kidney functions. This is the reason, it is an ingredient of [Chandraprabha Vati](https://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=MA5gy&m=3fC6FpGatlXmwtK&b=EfKPwhVqtsdwkWxtmqe6iA) - a famous medicine used for treating urinary tract disorders.

Though not directly related to lung activities, because of immuno-modulatory action, this combination can be taken to improve immunity against cold and cough. Courage: This combination is excellent to improve courage and confidence. It is useful to relieve phobia and depression.

Few concerns: Extreme hotness - this combination can increase warmth and burning sensation and heartburn. In some people, it can worsen anxiety. In women: There is no blanket ban on Shilajit for women. It is a false notion. It is very useful nearing menopause, when bone strength declines, fatigue, mood swings are to be addressed. But it is usually not recommended for a very long period of more than 3 months, continuously in women. Usage period: Like any other medicine, however good it may be, I would not recommend this for more than 2-3 months. After a month of its use, I would be intending to gradually decrease the dose before finally stopping it. How to take it? Tablets and capsules of both are available. General dose is 1 tablet of each, once a day, as per your doctor's advice. Combination in medicines "}
