A manifestation jar candle for balancing and unblocking your seven main chakras. This candle enhances the energy of your intention to assist your manifestation of desires with ease while using the power of will and taking appropriate action in the direction of your desires. Each crystal and herb was hand-selected for its extraordinary healing properties. This candle is infused with the incredible healing of aromatherapy. Crystal energy blended with hand-selected aromatherapy scents makes this candle a very powerful and effective tool for balancing the energy flow to all main chakra points. Manifestation is not something you can do once and receive results. It is a process that requires time and patience. You have to look at manifestation as taking control of your life. It's about understanding what you want for your own life then creating those outcomes. You have to be willing to work for what you manifest. Having a strong desire and belief isn't enough to manifest your desires. You need to take inspired actions. Manifesting is done spiritually and physically. Both are equally important. WHAT'S INSIDE: Inside this wonderful spell candle is 100% natural soy wax, wick, bergamot Scent, dressed with 7 crystals - Banded Amethyst, Lapis Lazuli, Blue Lace Agate, Amazonite, Citrine, Carnelian, Red Jasper, and chamomile and lavender herbs. Hand poured with pure intention. The wicks are constructed from natural flat cotton threads interwoven with paper threads that produce a rigid structure. They are lead and zinc free. The approximate burn time is approximately 30 hours. Both the scent and herbs are associated with balance, while the crystals are associated with each chakra. SCENT NOTES: An uplifting, crisp citrus of imported bergamot fruit. SOURCE: EarthSong Studios. SIZE: 4 oz jar INSTRUCTIONS: Instructions on how to use this spell candle are conveniently on the back label of the candle. They are also available here. 1. Find a quiet place to sit, preferably where you can connect with nature. 2. Sit cross-legged with your candle in front of you. 3. Speak a balancing affirmation, light your candle, and close your eyes. 4. Imagine a red light swirling at your tailbone. 5. If you notice any of the lights are difficult to imagine the light swirling, it means that the chakra is out of balance. Spend more time focusing on that chakra and place a hand on the area. Imagine the negative tension draining away and the light getting brighter. 6. Repeat this process for each chakra point with the corresponding color for each light. 7. End this session with another balancing affirmation, snuff your candle out, and relax!

More About Candles Spell candles are combinations of vibratory essences and aromatherapy that work on a deep level and are very powerful. They affect the physical and etheric levels to shift and raise your vibration, to energetically release that which is not of your highest good, to heal certain issues, rebalance you, and awaken your spiritual gifts and abilities. Their effects can be subtle or very intense. This depends on you and your chemistry. Experiment with them to see what works best for you! As everyone is different, no claims are made on what exact effect the candle will have on each individual. Please note that this candle is not a substitute for medical treatment, nor is it a medicine. Do not leave candles unattended while burning. Keep out of reach of children. It is not recommended to burn the candle for more than 4 hours at a time. Keep away from things that catch fire. Never touch or move a hot candle. Be sure to trim the wick before use. There are some aesthetic differences in soy wax; cosmetic frosting may occur. Frosting in soy wax candles is a natural byproduct of natural wax and in no way affects the burn ability or fragrance of the candle. It may occur on your candle's surface due to extreme temperature changes. After lighting your candle is where you would most commonly see frosting occur due to the temperature difference between the room and the candle. Since soy wax is natural, it dries much rougher than paraffin or mixed wax. We strived to make the candles as aesthetically pleasing as possible. However, there will always be some sort of small flaw. It's worth noting, though, that frosting is a sign of purity, meaning that the candle is 100% soy with no other additives. Aromatherapy is not meant to fragrance your home. However, you will find that this candle will fill a small area with an aroma. "}
