Part 1 presents an overview of KT and discusses some of the common barriers to successful KT within the chiropractic profession. Part 2 will suggest strategies to mitigate these barriers and reduce the evidence-practice gap for both the profession at large and for practicing clinicians. | || |[ ] [ Part 2: Narrowing the Evidence-Practice Can Chiropr Assoc. 2014 (Sep); 58 (3): 206-214 ~ FULL TEXT This two-part commentary aims to provide clinicians with a basic understanding of knowledge translation (KT), a term that is often used interchangeably with phrases such as knowledge transfer, translational research, knowledge mobilization, and knowledge exchange. [1] Knowledge translation, also known as the science of implementation, is increasingly recognized as a critical element in improving healthcare delivery and aligning the use of research knowledge with clinical practice. [2] The focus of our commentary relates to how these KT processes link with evidence-based chiropractic care. | || |[ ] [ Developing Clinical Practice Guidelines: Reviewing, Reporting,](../Graphics_Box_LINKS/ABSTRACTS/Developing_Clinical_Practice_Guidelines.shtml) and Publishing Guidelines; Updating Guidelines; and the Emerging Issues of Enhancing Guideline Implementability and Accounting for Comorbid Conditions in Guideline Development Implementation Science 2012 (Jul 4); 7: 62 ~ FULL TEXT Clinical practice guidelines are one of the foundations of efforts to improve health care. In 1999, we authored a paper about methods to develop guidelines. Since it was published, the methods of guideline development have progressed both in terms of methods and necessary procedures and the context for guideline development has changed with the emergence of guideline clearing houses and large scale guideline production organisations (such as the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence). It therefore seems timely to, in a series of three articles, update and extend our earlier paper. In this third paper we discuss the issues of: reviewing, reporting, and publishing guidelines; updating guidelines; and the two emerging issues of enhancing guideline implementability and how guideline developers should approach dealing with the issue of patients who will be the subject of guidelines having co-morbid conditions. | || |[ ] [ An Updated Overview of Clinical Guidelines for the Management](../Low_Back_Pain/Updated_Overview_of_Clinical_Guidelines.shtml) of Non-specific Low Back Pain in Primary Care European Spine Journal 2010 (Dec); 19 (12): 2075-2094 ~ FULL TEXT This updated review includes national clinical guidelines from 13 countries and 2 international clinical guidelines from Europe published from 2000 until 2008. The content of the guidelines appeared to be quite similar regarding the diagnostic classification (diagnostic triage) and the use of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Consistent features for acute low back pain were the early and gradual activation of patients, the discouragement of prescribed bed rest and the recognition of psychosocial factors as risk factors for chronicity. | || |[ ] [ Rigorous Development Does Not Ensure That Guidelines](../LINKS/ABSTRACTS/Rigorous_Development.shtml) are Acceptable to a Panel of Knowledgeable Providers J Gen Intern Med. 2008 (Jan); 23 (1): 37-44 Despite very rigorous development methods compared with guidelines assessed in prior studies, experts felt that these guidelines omitted common clinical situations and contained much content of uncertain validity. Guideline acceptability should be independently and formally evaluated before dissemination. | || |[ ] [ Chiropractic Clinical Practice Guideline:](https://chiro.org/Chronic_Neck/Chiropractic_Clinical_Practice_Guideline.shtml) Evidence-based Treatment of Adult Neck Pain Not Due to Whiplash J Canadian Chiro Assoc 2005 (Sep); 49 (3): 158-209 ~ FULL TEXT Researchers worked with the Canadian Chiropractic Association, the Canadian Federation of Chiropractic Regulatory Boards, the Clinical Practice Guidelines Development Initiative, and the Guidelines Development Committee (GDC) to provide an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the chiropractic cervical treatment of adults with acute or chronic neck pain not due to whiplash. | || |[ ] [ Evidence-Based Guidelines for the Chiropractic Treatment](../Headache/Evidence-Based_Guidelines_For.shtml) of Adults With Headache J Manipulative Physiol Ther. 2011 (Jun); 34 (5): 274-289 ~ FULL TEXT Evidence suggests that chiropractic care, including spinal manipulation, improves migraine and cervicogenic headaches. The type, frequency, dosage, and duration of treatment(s) should be based on guideline recommendations, clinical experience, and findings. Evidence for the use of spinal manipulation as an isolated intervention for patients with tension-type headache remains equivocal. | || |[ ] [ GRADE: An Emerging Consensus on Rating Quality of](../Graphics_Box_LINKS/ABSTRACTS/GRADE_An_Emerging_Consensus.shtml) Evidence and Strength of Recommendations British Medical Journal 2008 (Apr 26); 336 (7650): 924-926 ~ FULL TEXT Guidelines are inconsistent in how they rate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. This article explores the advantages of the GRADE system, which is increasingly being adopted by organisations worldwide | || | [ Evaluation of Clinical Practice Guidelines in Chiropractic](ABSTRACTS/Evaluation_of_Clinical_Practice.shtml) Care: A Comparison of North American Guideline Reports Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Assoc 2001 (Sep); 45 (3): 141-153 ~ FULL TEXT In the past two decades, clinical guidelines have become practical tools that assist clinicians, policy makers and insurers make informed decisions about the clinical and administrative management of patients. The popularity of these tools has increased so rapidly that clinicians now face the dilemma of having to choose from a plethora of documents of varying quality that were developed by various scientific, professional, political and commercial parties. In this context, a key challenge for the users of clinical practice guidelines is to determine whether their recommendations are valid, useful, based on the best available evidence and developed with sound scientific methodology. | || | [ Evidence-based Clinical Guidelines Submitted to the](https://www.jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(01)82862-1/fulltext) Australian National Health and Medical Research Council for the Management of Acute Low Back Pain: A Critical Review J Manipulative Physiol Ther 2001 (Feb); 24 (2): 131-139 ~ FULL TEXT Moves are afoot in Australia to publish Evidence-Based Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Acute Low Back Pain.1 A draft has been prepared by Professor Nikolai Bogduk of the University of Newcastle and the Newcastle Bone and Joint Institute, New South Wales. Bogduk has made a gallant attempt to address the issue of acute low back pain, but the document is seriously flawed in many respects. This is surprising and alarming, given the author's prominence in the international spine community. You will also enjoy this response from [Anthony L.

This article presents a combination of the literature about guideline development and the results of our combined experience in guideline development in North America and Britain. It considers the five steps in the initial development of an evidence based guideline | || |[ ] [ Chiropractic Care for Common Industrial Low Back Conditions](../Graphics_Box_LOW_BACK/Mootz_Guidelines.shtml) Chiropractic Technique 1993 (Aug); 5 (3): 119-125 ~ FULL TEXT This is the first guideline I have seen which actually states the number of visits which may be appropriate for a variety of common low back conditions. I have used these \"care plans\" for years, presenting them to third party's as a \"working diagnosis\" care plan, which need ongoing \"fine tuning\" during patient care. Check out this Chiropractic Technique article, and the attached care plans, which have been released exclusively to Chiro.Org by the National College of Chiropractic. Thanks, Dana!
