Active immunity can be acquired in two ways, either by contracting the disease or through vaccination. Active immunity is usually permanent, meaning an individual is protected from the disease for the duration of their lives. - Acute - A short-term, intense health effect. - Adjuvant - A substance (e.g. aluminum salt) that is added during production to increase the body's immune response to a vaccine. - Adverse events - Undesirable experiences occurring after immunization that may or may not be related to the vaccine. - Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) - A panel of 10 experts who make recommendations on the use of vaccines in the United States. The panel is advised on current issues by representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Medical Association and others. The recommendations of the ACIP guide immunization practice at the federal, state and local level. - - A condition in which the body has an exaggerated response to a substance (e.g. food or drug). Also known as [hypersensitivity](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#hyper). - Anaphylaxis - An immediate and severe allergic reaction to a substance (e.g. food or drugs). Symptoms of anaphylaxis include breathing difficulties, loss of consciousness and a drop in blood pressure. This condition can be fatal and requires immediate medical attention. - Antibody - A protein found in the blood that is produced in response to foreign substances (e.g. bacteria or viruses) invading the body. Antibodies protect the body from disease by binding to these organisms and destroying them. - - Foreign substances (e.g. bacteria or viruses) in the body that are capable of causing disease. The presence of antigens in the body triggers an immune response, usually the production of antibodies. - Antitoxin - Antibodies capable of destroying microorganisms including viruses and bacteria. - Arthralgia - Joint pain. - Arthritis - A medical condition characterized by inflammation of the joints which results in pain and difficulty moving. - Association - The degree to which the occurrence of two variables or events is linked. Association describes a situation where the likelihood of one event occurring depends on the presence of another event or variable. However, an association between two variables does not necessarily imply a cause and effect relationship. The term association and relationship are often used interchangeably. See [causal](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#causal)and [temporal](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#temporal)association. - - The presence of an infection without symptoms.

Attenuated vaccines currently licensed in the United States include measles, mumps, rubella, polio, yellow fever and varicella. Also known as a [live vaccine](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#live_vaccine). - Autism - A chronic developmental disorder usually diagnosed between 18 and 30 months of age. Symptoms include problems with social interaction and communication as well as repetitive interests and activities. At this time, the cause of autism is not known although many experts believe it to be a genetically based disorder that occurs before birth. - - Small white blood cells that help the body defend itself against infection. These cells are produced in bone marrow and develop into plasma cells which produce antibodies. Also known as B [lymphocytes.](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#lymphocytes) - Bacteria - Tiny one-celled organisms present throughout the environment that require a microscope to be seen.

Examples of bacterial disease include [diphtheria](/immunize/dict_vpd.shtm#diptheria), [pertussis](/immunize/dict_vpd.shtm#pertussis), [tetanus](/immunize/dict_vpd.shtm#tetanus), [Haemophilus influenzae](/immunize/dict_vpd.shtm#hib)and pneumococcus (pneumonia). - Bias - Flaws in the collection, analysis or interpretation of research data that lead to incorrect conclusions. - Biological plausibility- - A causal association (or relationship between two factors) is consistent with existing medical knowledge. - Bone marrow - Soft tissue located within bones that produce all blood cells, including the ones that fight infection. - Booster shots - Additional doses of a vaccine needed periodically to \"boost\" the immune system. For example, the tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine which is recommended for adults every ten years. [Causal association] - The presence or absence of a variable (e.g. smoking) is responsible for an increase or decrease in another variable (e.g. cancer). A change in exposure leads to a change in the outcome of interest. - Chronic health condition - A health related state that lasts for a long period of time (e.g. cancer, asthma). - Combination vaccine - Two or more vaccines administered at once in order to reduce the number of shots given. For example, the [MMR](/immunize/dictionary.shtm#mmr)(measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. - - Capable of spreading disease. Also known as [infectious](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#infectious). - - Having a large percentage of the population vaccinated in order to prevent the spread of certain infectious diseases. Even individuals not vaccinated (such as newborns and those with chronic illnesses) are offered some protection because the disease has little opportunity to spread within the community. Also known as [herd immunity](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#herd). - Complement A complex series of blood proteins whose action \"complements\" the work of antibodies. Complement destroys antibody-coated cells, produces inflammation, and regulates immune response. - Conjugate vaccine - The joining together of two compounds (usually a protein and polysaccharide) to increase a vaccine's effectiveness. - Conjunctivitis - Inflammation of the mucous membranes surrounding the eye causing the area to become red and irritated. The membranes may be irritated because of exposure to heat, cold or chemicals. This condition is also caused by viruses, bacteria or allergies. - Contraindication - A condition in a recipient which is likely to result in a life-threatening problem if a vaccine were given. - - See [Seizure](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#seizure). [Demyelinating disorders] - A medical condition where the myelin sheath is damaged. The myelin sheath surrounds nerves and is responsible for the transmission of impulses to the brain.

Erthema Multiforme has been reported following infection. Symptoms persist anywhere from 2 days to 4 weeks and include skin lesions, blisters, itching, fatigue, joint pain and fever. - Etiology - The cause of. - Exposure - Contact with infectious agents (bacteria or viruses) in a manner that promotes transmission and increases the likelihood of disease. - Febrile - Relating to fever; feverish. - - A rare neurological disease characterized by loss of reflexes and temporary paralysis. Symptoms include weakness, numbness, tingling and increased sensitivity that spreads over the body. Muscle paralysis starts in the feet and legs and moves upwards to the arms and hands. Sometimes paralysis can result in the respiratory muscles causing breathing difficulties. Symptoms usually appear over the course of one day and may continue to progress for 3 or 4 days up to 3 or 4 weeks. Recovery begins within 2-4 weeks after the progression stops. While most patients recover, approximately 15%-20% experience persistent symptoms. GBS is fatal in 5% of cases. - HBsAg - Hepatitis B surface [antigen](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#antigen). - - See [community immunity](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#community). - - A disease characterized by painful skin lesions that occur mainly on the trunk (back and stomach) of the body but which can also develop on the face and in the mouth. Complications include headache, vomiting, fever and meningitis. Recovery may take up to 5 weeks. Herpes Zoster is caused by the same virus that is responsible for chickenpox. Most people are exposed to this virus during childhood. After the primary infection (chickenpox), the virus becomes dormant, or inactivated. In some people the virus reactivates years, or even decades, later and causes herpes zoster. Also known as the [shingles](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#shingles). - - The eruption of red marks on the skin that are usually accompanied by itching.

Also known as gamma globulin. - Immune system - The complex system in the body responsible for fighting disease. Its primary function is to identify foreign substances in the body (bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites) and develop a defense against them. This defense is known as the immune response. It involves production of protein molecules called antibodies to eliminate foreign organisms that invade the body. - Immunity - Protection against a disease. There are two types of immunity, passive and active. Immunity is indicated by the presence of antibodies in the blood and can usually be determined with a laboratory test. See [active](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#activeimm)and [passive](/immunize/dict_terms.shtm#passiveimm)immunity. - Immunization - The process by which a person or animal becomes protected against a disease.

Eventually, in most patients, remissions do not reach baseline levels and permanent disability and sometimes death occurs. The cause of MS is unknown. The most widely held hypothesis is that MS occurs in patients with a genetic susceptibility and that some environmental factors \"trigger\" exacerbations. MS is 3 times more common in women than men, with diagnosis usually made as young adults.
