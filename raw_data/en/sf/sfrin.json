Discard the biological samples and any extra media according to SOPs . 5. Interpretation of the Test Results 5.1 If Mycoplasma colony growth appears on any of the positive control plates and does not appear on any of the negative control plates, the test is valid. 5.2 If no Mycoplasma colonies are detected on any of the sample agar plates, the sample is determined to be negative for Mycoplasma contamination and is satisfactory (SAT). 5.3 If Mycoplasma colony growth is found on any of the sample agar plates , the sample is positive for Mycoplasma contamination and is unsatisfactory (UNSAT). 5.4 If mold or bacteria is detected on the agar plates at any time during the test and the sample cannot be ruled out as the source of the contamination, a sterility test will be performed according to the appropriate SAM. This will add a 3-week delay before the test results are reported for the serial . If the sterility test indicates that the serial is contaminated , the Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) will report a No Test (NT) for the Mycoplasma test and an UNSAT for the sterility test . The final serial disposition will be reported as UNSAT. 6. Report of Test Results Report the test results as described by SOPs . 7.

The following procedures are used for the Oxoid AnaeroJar 3.5 L System : 1. Remove the clamp, lid with O -ring seal , and the plate rack from the anaerobic jar. Invert the agar plates and stack them in the plate rack. Be sure to use an even number of plates to keep them from tipping over inside the jar. An uninoculated agar plate may be used as an extra plate. 2. Place a small stack of 4 x 4 gauze pads moistened with water on the bottom of the jar to provide humidity during incubation . Place the plate rack with stacked plates back into the anaerobic jar. Place the lid with O -ring seal onto the anaerobic jar and attach the clamp . Turn the knob on the clamp until it is hand - tight. 3. Attach the rubber hose to the vacuum port of the pu mp. Attach the end of the hose fitted with the Schrader valve chuck to the Schrader valve labeled \"vacuum\" on the lid of the anaerobic jar. The gage on the lid measures both vacuum and pressure. Vacuum is measured in inches of mercury ( inHg ) and are indicated by red numbers . Pressure is measured in pounds per square inch ( psi) and is indicated by black numbers . The gauge should read zero (0). 4. Start the vacuum pump and allow the vacuum in the jar to reach 20 to 25 inHg . Detach the Schrade r valve from the jar lid and then turn off the vacuum pump. 5. Detach the hose from the vacuum pump port and attach it to the N 2/CO 2 gas regulator port. Turn on the N 2/CO 2 gas regulator valve and allow gas to start flowing, and then attach the Schrader v alve chuck to the unmarked Schrader valve on the lid of the anaerobic jar. Center for Veterinary Biologics SAM 910. 04 Testing Protocol Page 13 of 13 Supplemental Assay Method for Detection of Mycoplasma Contamination UNCONTROLLED COPY 6. Allow the pressure of the anaerobic jar to return to 0 . Detach the Schrader valve from the jar lid and then turn off the flow of gas. 7. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 twice. 8. Incubate the anaerobic jar in a 33\u00b0- 37\u00b0C incubator for 10 to 14 days. 9. After use, disinfect the jar and its components. Liberally spray the inside of the an aerobic jar lid with fresh 1% Virkon solution. Allow the disinfectant t o soak for 10 minutes. Rinse the lid with deionized water and air dry. 10. Fill the anaerobic jar with water and deposit two Virkon tablets in the water . Place the plate rack rubber and O -ring seal in the jar . Allow the disinfectant to soak for 30 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with hot water , rinse with deionized water, and air dry. "}
