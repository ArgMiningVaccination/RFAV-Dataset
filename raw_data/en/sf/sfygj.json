Recent studies have demonstrated antioxidant, antimutagenic, antiviral, anticancer, anti-allergic, immune enhancing, hepato-protective, blood vessel and blood lipid-lowering effects of spirulina extracts [2, 3]. The aim of the study is to identify and characterize wound healing effects of compound (c-phycocyanin) isolated from Spirulina platensis. Effects of cell viability and proliferation of spirulina crude extract and c-phycocyanin were evaluated by the MTT assay on primary human skin epithelium cells. The wound healing activity was studied by using the in vitro wound healing method, which is cell layer in a circular zone of 5mm diameter, making use of a sterile teflon bar that removes cells, a wound was formed by scratching carefully [4]. Compared to the positive control EGF (0.5\u00b5g/ml), spirulina crude extract and c-phycocyanin showed stronger wound healing activity at 33.5\u00b5g/ml concentration. In order to see in vivo efficiency of the spirulina crude extract and c-phycocyanin, an animal study with Sprague-Dawley male rats at the age of 12 weeks was carried out, and then the main histological outcomes were investigated to observe reepithelization, neovascularization, presence of inflammatory cells, granulation tissue amount and maturation. It is observed that c-phycocyanin 1.25% has a better effect on the 7th day compared to other preparations. References: [1] Muhammed, F. S. Arikan, F. et "}
