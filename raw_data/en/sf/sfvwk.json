Immune System Components White blood cells Lymphoid Tissues: Bone marrow - site of B cell development Thymus -site of T cell maturation Spleen, lymph nodes, Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue, adenoids, appendix, tonsils Organisation of the Immune System u Source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunological_memory Innate Immunity (Natural ) 1st line of defence. Non specific host defences Initial and immediate response to pathogen invasion Physical barriers - skin and mucous membranes Chemical barriers - gastric and digestive enzymes Cellular and Protein secretions -complement, phagocytes , macrophages, mast cells, white blood cells. Defining characteristic: No memory persists afterwards Adaptive Immunity (acquired) 2nd line of defence. Develops as a response to infection. Adaptive means immune system adapts to previously unseen molecules. Slow, can take days or weeks. The foreign agent is recognised in a specific manner and the immune system develops a memory of it. The response increases in strength and effectiveness with each encounter. Cell mediated (T cells) and Humoral mediated (B cells) Passive immunity - adaptive mechanisms Natural maternal transfer of antibodies to infant via placenta Artificial administration of pre - formed substance to provide immediate but short -term protection (antitoxin, immunoglobulin ) Protection within 48 hours but is temporary and wanes with time (usually few months) Active immunity - adaptive mechanisms Natural following contact with organism Artificial administration of agent to stimulate immune response (immunisation) Induction of immunity by infection or vaccination is active immunity Protection produced by individual's own immune system Protection often life -long but may need boosting How does adaptive (acquired) immunity work The invading organism has antigens on the exterior of its cells. Antigen is a live or inactivated substance capable of producing an immune response. Antibodies are proteins on cells in the immune system which react with antigens forming an antigen -antibody complex. The immune system is activated making more specific antibodies marking the antigen for destruction. The concept of the immune response to a specific antigen is central to development of vaccines Active Immunity Macrophages digest most of the micro - organism except the antigens. They 'regurgitate' the antigens displaying them on their surface so that white cells called lymphocytes can take over the attack (T cells and B cells) Humoral Immunity B cells (antibodies) Cell mediated Immunity T cells activate immune response Killer cells destroy infected cells and micro -organisms Helper cells stimulate and direct activity of other immune cells e.g. T and B cells.. Antibodies www.immunisation.ie -Different types IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, IgE made by B cells Functions -Neutralise toxins -Block adhesion/cell entry of the antigen -Neutralise and prevent organisms replication Signals macrophages etc to come Kills organism via complement -lysis Antigen specific -Cannot cross -protect different type of micro - organism Memory cells After the body has eliminated the infection, some B cells and T cells become memory cells. These retain memory of the pathogen On re -exposure to the antigen, the different B and T cell clones will increase to form a polyclonal response and mount a powerful immune response. This ability of the immune system to have a memory for previous antigens is the basis for vaccination. Takes 4 -7 days to generate immune response. >7 days get Primary immune response Mainly IgM Primary response turned off after about 3 weeks. Memory B cells made. Secondary /subsequent immune response More powerful and faster Mainly IgG. Occurs as memory cells secrete Ab when agent reencountered. Takes 2 weeks to get optimum immune response after vaccination 18 With kind permission from Nick Holmes es Source: HPA Vaccine is a suspension of live attenuated or inactivated micro -organisms or fractions thereof given to induce immunity and prevent infectious disease. Vaccination is the administration of any vaccine or toxin. Immunisation means receiving a vaccine and also becoming immune because of being vaccinated. How vaccines work Induce active immunity artificially Immunity and immunological memory similar to natural infection but without the risk of disease Immunological memory allows Rapid recognition and response to the antigens of the micro -organism Prevents or modifies effect of the disease 1. Live attenuated 2. Inactivated Whole cell Fractionated Protein based Subunit Toxoid Polysaccharide Pure Conjugate Weakened viruses / bacteria 17 Achieved by growing numerous generations in lab Causes immune response closest to that which the natural infection would - has cellular (T -cell) and humoral(B -cell) components. Produces long lasting immunity after 1 or 2 doses Can cause mild version of the disease e.g. mini measles which is not transmissible Can cause active disease in immunocompromised persons E.g. BCG / MMR / Varicella / Yellow Fever/Rotavirus Non live vaccines Cannot cause disease they are designed to protect against Cannot replicate Immune response mostly antibody based. Antibody titre falls with time. Often need adjuvant or conjugation to stimulate the immune response. Doses -3-5 doses usually required Classified as -Inactivated -Conjugate -Recombinant -Sub unit Inactivated vaccine and toxoids contains killed bacteria or viruses, or a portion thereof e.g. inactivated polio vaccine toxoids e.g. tetanus, diphtheria Conjugate vaccine where a protein or polysaccharide antigen is linked to a carrier protein e.g. meningococcal C conjugate vaccine Recombinant vaccine produced through recombinant DNA technology e.g. hepatitis B and HPV vaccine Sub unit vaccine contains only specific antigenic proteins of an infectious agent e.g. acellular pertussis and some influenza vaccines Vaccine Components Conjugating agents Some bacteria have an outer polysaccharide coat to disguise the antigens -encapsulated organisms - making it difficult for the immune system to respond to the bacterium inside. So -Carrier proteins are used which combine with antigens to improve immunogenicity . -Men C, PCV, amounts used to stabilise vaccine -May cause allergic reaction Vaccine Components Adjuvants Aluminum salts used to increase immunogenicity of vaccines containing inactivated micro -organisms or their products . e.g. Hepatitis B vaccine Tetanus toxoid Diphtheria toxoid Mercury containing compound used as a preservative in some multidose vaccines to prevent bacterial and fungal growth Also used as inactivating agent in early stage production of some killed vaccines In 1999 E.U. and U.S. manufacturer's decided to decrease thiomersal levels in vaccines as a precaution and to retain trust in vaccine supply WHO state that there is no evidence of toxicity in infants, children or adults exposed to thiomersal other than hypersensitivity r eactio ns. All vaccines used in the routine infant immunisation programme are thiomersal free. Some vaccines used in older children and adults contain trace amounts including some formulations of the influenza vaccine *Also known as thimerosal Time intervals between vaccine doses www.immunisation.ie Antigen combination Recommended minimal interval between doses 2 killed antigens No minimum interval Killed and live antigens No minimum interval 2 live antigens Four-week minimum interval if not administered simultaneously Diminishes immune interference If another live vaccine is given while the immune system is making a primary immune response, the activation of the innate immune system may neutralise the second live vaccine so that it does not work. Hence we wait 4 weeks to allow the immune system to recover Human normal immunoglobulin contains antibodies to many infections including measles. These antibodies will neutralise any live vaccine. Hence we wait 3 months for the antibody level to fall Allows each immune response to develop - e.g. primary immunisation (1 month) This allows the next response to be a true secondary response - i.e. faster and bigger and with higher affinity IgG Maternal IgG is transferred across the placenta Passively acquired IgG from mother can suppress response to DTP , Polio, Men C and Hib vaccine for about 2 months Maternal antibody to measles may interfere for up to a year Source HPA Influenza & PCV In those aged 12 -23 months these should be separated by at least 1 week due to slight increased risk of fever if given together Rotavirus No interval needed between it and other live vaccines Yellow Fever and MMR Ideally separate by 1 month as may be suboptimal response if given together Vaccine overload www.immunisation.ie The human body is composed of 10 trillion cells and contains 100 trillion bacteria On average there are 1000 bacteria on each cm2 of skin 1,000,000 bacteria on each cm2 of the scalp 100,000,000 bacteria per gram of saliva The maximum number of antigens in a vaccine is about 3000 With the new vaccines this number is much lower still No evidence that vaccines can overload the immune system http://www.schoolscience.co.uk/content/4/biology/abpi/immune/immune3 Adverse events www.immunisation.ie Live vaccines : -frequency of adverse events falls with number of doses -If antibody is made -> neutralises small amount of vaccine virus in any subsequent vaccine dose -E.g. MMR Inactivated vaccines -frequency of adverse events increases with number of doses -Good antibody levels ->greater secondary immune response So m ay be inflammatory effects (i.e. produce a sore arm) -E.g. tetanus, pertussis Primary failure Individual fails to make an adequate immune response to the initial vaccination (e.g. in about 10% of measles and mumps vaccine recipients) Infection possible any time post vaccination Secondary failure Individual makes an adequate immune response initially but then immunity wanes over time A feature of most inactivated vaccines, hence the need for boosters Herd immunity www.immunisation.ie Only applies to diseases which are passed from person to person For each disease -a certain level of immunity in the population which protects the whole population because the disease stops spreading in the community Provides indirect protection of unvaccinated as well as vaccinated individuals. Some cannot receive live vaccines eg immunocomprised. No vaccine is 100% effective. May be the most important aspect of how vaccines work -MMR given to infants protects pregnant women from rubella. -Can eradicate disease even if some people remain susceptible http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/About_Immunisation/Science/How_immunisation_wor ks_-_animation Resources A Practical Guide to Immunisation HSE http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/hcpinfo/trainingmanual/ Immunity and how vaccines work.
