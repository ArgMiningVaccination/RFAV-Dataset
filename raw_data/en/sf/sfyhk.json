During this time with Dr. Elkon at the Hospital for Special Surgery, the fields of autoimmune disease and lupus were first introduced to her. Dr. Kim was fascinated by how the immune system was balanced by cytokines produced by innate immune cells, especially macrophage and dendritic cells. Her knowledge about cytokine regulation was further extended by studying with Dr. Ma during her thesis study. She and Dr. Ma identified a novel transcription factor, which is directly regulated by phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and inhibits Diamond's](http://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/betty-diamond-md) laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University, Dr. Kim studied disease-related research and focused on how dendritic cells contribute immune homeostasis and development of lupus in mouse models. At the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, she continued to work with Dr. Diamond along with a new collaborator, [Dr. Peter K. Gregersen](http://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/peter-k-gregersen-md) [,](http://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/peter-k-gregersen-md) studying human lupus risk SNP in dendritic cells and follicular helper T cells. The focus of Dr. Kim's laboratory research is to identify the regulatory mechanism of inflammatory function of dendritic cells under both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying inhibition of development of autoimmune diseases, particularly in systemic lupus and inflammatory bowel diseases, we are using an animal model of SLE which has a dendritic specific deletion of transcription factor, Blimp-1. Dr. Kim recently expanded her research to the area of PRDM1 (human gene encoding Blimp-1) susceptibility loci to lupus and alteration of metabolism in follicular helper T cells and autoreactive B cells, which will further enhance the understanding of the mechanism in human diseases. Specific focuses are: Kyungwoo Lee Postdoctoral Fellow Research: Repertoire of helper T cells in mouse model of lupus and DC metabolism Vera Kim Postdoctoral Fellow Research: Functional alteration of follicular lupus Ivan Ramirez De Oleo Rheumatology Fellow Research: Pathogenic function of age-associated B cells (ABCs) in animal model of lupus Hong Tian Laboratory Technician General Lab Manager Seoul Women's University; Seoul, Korea Degree: BS 1994 Seoul Women's University; Seoul, Korea Degree: MS 1996 Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences Degree: PhD 2004 Field of study: Immunology Columbia University Degree: Postdoctoral fellow 2006 The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY Degree: Postdoctoral fellow 2010 "}
