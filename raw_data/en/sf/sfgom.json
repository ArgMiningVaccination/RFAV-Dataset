What is a Cleanse? Why is Cleansing Helpful? Who Should Cleanse? Group Cleanses Individualized Cleanses What is a Cleanse? There are many different cleanses out there.The most extreme forms are juicing, water fasting and the Master Cleanse. Although these can be beneficial ways to cleanse, they are not appropriate for everyone or necessary for most people due to the extreme nature of the cleanses.Dr. Enos' cleanse philosophy is based on the teaching of sustainable habits rather than extreme measures.Her seasonal cleanses are based on eating whole foods, following an anti-inflammatory diet, eliminating common food sensitivities and using key detox nutrients and herbs along with lifestyle recommendations to increase your body's natural ability to clean and detox. Basically, cleanses give your body a break from food substances that commonly compromise health and will help your body to eliminate toxins that may be accumulating from environmental and lifestyle exposure.Wondering if your environment is toxic?Keep reading! Why is Cleansing Helpful? Your body has natural routes of detoxification and built in mechanisms for cleansing itself.These are often overwhelmed by the modern environment because they evolved in a much simpler world.These routes include your emunctories: liver, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, kidneys/bladder, and skin.Detoxification also happens at a cellular, biochemical level. Think about an average day.First thing in the morning you take a shower.What does your shampoo and soap have in it?Your cosmetics?Do you recognize all the ingredients?Most personal care products contain chemicals that our bodies do not need and have to eliminate through one or more of the above routes.Think about the strong smells of new cars, new furniture, paint, detergents and cleaning products.Most of these are also laden with toxins your body has to deal with.Are you eating foods grown with pesticides and artificial fertilizers?Do they have preservatives in them?Rancid oils?Are you eating a food you are sensitive to?What about the water you are drinking and air you are breathing?These can all be sources of toxins.Stress and our general mental emotional state can also contribute to the toxic burden in our bodies and the suboptimal functioning of your body's normal routes of elimination. When the routes of elimination and detoxificaiton become over burderned, the toxins accumulate in your body and cause problems for the normal function of your cells, tissues, organs and whole body.Sometimes this overwhelm of the emunctories results in a variety of frank diseases and other times it results in the slow decrease of function we often attribute simply to aging.The effects can be insidious.You might be used to how you feel but when was the last time you felt awesome?Or maybe you do feel awesome but want some tools to make sure you continue to feel that way. Who Should Cleanse? A gentle seasonal cleanse is appropriate for most people and practically everyone benefits from them?Dr. Enos has seen chronic health conditions such as arthritis, diabetes, endometriosis, high blood pressure, many autoimmune conditions and depression,just to name a few, improve due to cleanses.Cleanses are even beneficial for those of you that are basically healthy but want to optimize your health and practice preventive medicine. Group Cleanses: Dr. Enos offers three group, seasonal cleanses each year in both Colorado and California.These are the Winter Renewal Cleanse, Spring/Summer Invigoration Cleanse and Fall Preparation Cleanse.These Cleanses all involve nutrient dense, whole foods based, anti-inflammatory eating plans (no fasting or going hungry) designed to help each participant feel his/her best and to identify common food sensitivities which may be compromising optimal health.Unique to each Seasonal Cleanse are food and lifestyle recommendations as well as supplements specific to the time of year and theme for that cleanse.Various health topics are addressed and discussed during each season; there is always something to learn for experienced as well as new cleansers. Each cleanse begins with a pre-cleanse meeting.An in-depth discussion of an anti-inflammatory, season appropriate eating plan takes place.This is a fantastic opportunity to ask any nutrition questions you might have whether or not they are directly related to the current Cleanse.You will also be walked through the components of the Cleanse, including seasonal hydrotherapy, supplements and other lifestyle recommendations.Dr. Enos enjoys using these pre-cleanse meetings as teaching opportunities to share a variety of health information with participants.Past topics have included inflammation, blood sugar, aging and anti-aging, cancer and weight loss.On the last day of the Cleanse, participants will meet again to learn how to reintroduce foods in a manner that will allow them to identify food sensitivities and clearly experience how different foods affect their mood and energy level.The closing meeting is also an opportunity to share experiences, ask questions, and set post-cleanse goals.During the Cleanse, participants are supported by Dr. Enos and by each other through Google Groups. Individualized Cleanses: Dr. Enos frequently designs cleanses for the needs of individual patients as well.Please contact her directly for more information. "}
