What is integrative medicine? According to the Cleveland Clinic, integrative medicine uses a combination of therapies and lifestyle changes to treat and heal the whole person. It focuses on your complete mind, body and soul and uses an evidence-based approach to improve your health and wellness. With integrative medicine, the relationships between you and your healthcare providers are very important. Always remember, you are an equal partner in your healing process. Maintain open communication with all of your providers to help you get the most out of treatment. What's the difference between integrative medicine and functional medicine? Integrative medicine and functional medicine are similar, but they approach healing in slightly different ways. Integrative medicine seeks to understand you as a whole person. It uses many different types of therapy to heal your mind, body and spirit. Functional medicine seeks to identify and treat the underlying cause of your condition. It centers on the idea that one condition may have many causes or one cause can have many conditions. How can integrative medicine help me?

A Unicorn in the Healthcare Industry All too common in women's healthcare, we are bascially told our health issues are all in our head. Dr. Saguil, you are a unicorn in the healthcare industry for your compassion and willingness to think outside the box. Lisa M. Complete Lyme Recovery After being sent around to several \"specialists\" for a chronic co-infection of Lyme Disease, I was only prescribed drugs for menopause and anxiety. I refused to take the drugs, so a friend referred me to Dr. Ric. Because he listened so attunely, the myriad of complaints and symptoms I was experiencing (some of which were even bizarre to me!) disappeared and I am now fully recovered. I was dealing with brain fog, vision problems, paralysis and a long list of symptoms. Dr. Ric is unique in spirit and in his approach to treating the individual rather than isolated symptoms. I am forever grateful for his healing attitude and compassionate care. ~ Tania P. "}
