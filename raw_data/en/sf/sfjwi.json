Flu vaccinations are not a safe, viable or even effective solution to cold and flu prevention. Using homeopathics and other substances to stimulate the body's defenses in these trying months is the ideal scenario. The Unda Homeopathic Laboratory of Belgium designed a remedy to help prevent seasonal ailments such as the influenza virus and the common cold. This product is called 'Mucococcinum' (MEW-KO-KOX-EYE-NUM) and is a preparation of two homeopathic bacterial fractions and one viral fraction. 'Homeopathic' remedies are made in a very special way, resulting in a minute dose of a given substance, and will not cause illness as can occur with flu vaccine. Historically, a homeopathic form of a bacteria or virus was used to prevent illness as an original form of 'vaccination,' prior to the development of vaccines as we know them today. Homeopathic remedies are non-addictive, without side effects, and 100% safe. In my opinion, present day vaccinations are NOT 100% safe because they carry altered forms of the offending pathogen (bacteria or virus) or secretions from these organisms, and perhaps some form of preservative, many of which are untested for use in humans or even contain heavy metals. Flu vaccinations are not conducive to supporting the body's own defenses and, in fact, paralyze the immunity. 'Mucococcinum' is an alternate option to the yearly flu vaccine. INDICATIONS: Mucococcinum can be taken both for prevention and treatment of colds and flus. - - RECOMMENDED DOSE for 'PREVENTION' of COLDS and FLU 1 tablet every 10 days from October to February. - - RECOMMENDED DOSE for ONSET of an ACUTE COLD or FLU 1 tablet three times a day, until symptoms improve**** ****Additional support with Unda numbers, herbs and single remedies is ideal.
