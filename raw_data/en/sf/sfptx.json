The immunologic mech-anisms whereby zinc modulates increased susceptibility to infec-tion have been studied for several decades. It is clear that zincaffects multiple aspects of the immune system, from the barrierof the skin to gene regulation within lymphocytes. Zinc is crucialfor normal development and function of cells mediating nonspe-cific immunity such as neutrophils and natural killer cells. Zincdeficiency also affects development of acquired immunity bypreventing both the outgrowth and certain functions of T lym-phocytes such as activation,T h1 cytokine production,and anti-body production, particularly immunoglobulin G, is compro-mised. The macrophage, a pivotal cell in many immunologicfunctions, is adversely affected by zinc deficiency, which candysregulate intracellular killing, cytokine production, andphagocytosis. The effects of zinc on these key immunologicmediators is rooted in the myriad roles for zinc in basic cellularfunctions such as DNA replication, RNA transcription, cell divi-sion, and cell activation. Apoptosis is potentiated by zinc defi-ciency. Zinc also functions as an antioxidant and can stabilizemembranes. This review explores these aspects of zinc biologyof the immune system and attempts to provide a biological basisfor the altered host resistance to infections observed during zincdeficiency and supplementation.

Zinc, zinc deficiency, immunity, infection, micronutrients, ontogeny, apoptosis INTRODUCTION Animal studies in the 1930s first documented the essentiality of zinc for growth and survival of animals (1). Unfortunately, itwas not until the 1960s and the seminal work of Prasad (2) thatthe importance of zinc deficiency in human populations wasappreciated. Later, it became clear that zinc was also crucial forpatients maintained on parenteral nutrition (3). A central clinicalfeature of zinc deficiency in these latter 2 cases was theincreased susceptibility to infectious diseases. This ledresearchers to speculate that zinc must be important for hostimmunity. Indeed, the past 2 decades have witnessed a rapidgrowth in knowledge of the underlying mechanisms wherebyzinc exerts its ubiquitous effects on immune function, disease resistance, and general health. Analysis of animal and humanstudies examining the in vivo effects of nutritional zinc defi-ciency and supplementation on immune cells and their functionunderscores the essential role of zinc in normal development andfunction of many key tissues,cells,and effectors of immunity. Invitro studies have elucidated the role of zinc at the cellular level,and recent advances in molecular biology and cell biology havebegun to clarify the role of zinc in gene expression, mitosis, andapoptosis of lymphoid cells. From these studies, many of whichare reviewed herein, it is clear that even mild zinc deficiency canimpair multiple mediators of host immunity ranging from thephysical barrier of the skin to acquired cellular and humoralimmunity (4-10). This article represents a synthesis and expan-sion of 2 previous reviews examining the role of zinc on healthand immune function (9,10). Two figures are presented that inte-grate the concepts relating zinc to development and function ofimmune cells ( Figure 1 ) and the role of zinc in the cellular processes of activation and proliferation ( Figure 2). ZINC DEFICIENCY In persons suffering from marginal zinc deficiency, clinical signs are depressed immunity, impaired taste and smell, onset ofnight blindness, impairment of memory, and decreased sper-matogenesis in males (9, 10). Severe zinc deficiency is charac-terized by severely depressed immune function, frequent infec-tions, bullous pustular dermatitis, diarrhea, alopecia, and mentaldisturbances (3,9).

A rare genetic disorder, known as acrodermatitis enteropathica, occurs in cattleand humans,resulting in decreased zinc absorption accompaniedby characteristic hyperpigmented skin lesions, poor growth, andlow plasma zinc concentrations (12, 13). ZINC STATUS AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES Influence of zinc on experimental infections in animals Numerous animal and human studies indicate that zinc defi- ciency decreases resistance to infectious diseases. Zinc-deficientanimals have suppressed immune responses and are more sus-ceptible to a diverse range of infectious agents including Herpes simplexvirus (14) and Semliki forest virus (15); bacteria Francisella tularensis (16),Listeria (17, (31). A selective overview of these studies illustrates the broad role of zinc during infection. Zinc-deficient mice infected with T. musculiharbored >3 times as many parasites as control mice, and this was associated with delay in production of protectiveantibodies (22). Likewise, 40% of moderately zinc-deficientmice succumbed to P. yoelii 17XNL malaria, a normally non- lethal infection (24). Again, this was accompanied by delayedappearance of protective immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies.With respect to C. albicans , genetically susceptible strains of mice were rendered resistant when fed zinc-enriched diets orwhen zinc was administered intraperitoneally (15, 25), and nor-mally resistant mice became susceptible when maintained on alow-zinc diet (25). For the helminth infections, zinc-deficientanimals either harbored more worms or had prolonged expulsiontimes. For H. polygyrus ,marginal zinc deficiency had little effect (27), although severe zinc deficiency did increase worm burdens(26). In murine S. mansoni , zinc deficiency resulted in decreased pathology with no change in worm burdens (31). For Listeria, delayed hypersensitivity response, a measure of T lymphocyteactivation, was reduced but actual bacterial clearance did notchange substantially (17,18). In naturally occurring bovine acro-dermatitis enteropathica, calves had impaired resistance toviruses, fungi, and bacteria. This condition was corrected byincreased dietary zinc intakes (32). Influence of zinc on infectious diseases in human populations Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of zinc supple- mentation on infectious diseases in human populations. Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of daily zinc supplementationshowed that zinc reduces the incidence and duration of acute andchronic diarrhea by 25-30% (33-35) and can reduce the inci-dence of acute lower respiratory infections by 45% (36). Somestudies implied that zinc may reduce clinical disease caused byPlasmodium falciparum (37, 38), and it was recently shown in a controlled trial carried out in Papua New Guinea that zinc sup-plements could reduce malaria attributable to health center atten-dance by >35% (39). Zinc supplementation also reduced the fre- quency of recurrent boils in hospital patients (40). Furthermore,decreased S. mansoni egg counts were observed in children given zinc supplements compared with those given a placebo(41). Humans suffering from acrodermatitis enteropathica alsohad fewer infections when given supranormal concentrations ofzinc (42), and plasma zinc concentrations were substantiallylower in patients with diffuse lepromatous leprosy comparedwith those with the more limited bacillary form (43). Zinc supplements also have beneficial effects when adminis- tered during infection. Zinc lozenges were shown to decrease theduration of the common cold (44, 45), and studies in preschoolchildren showed that zinc supplementation during a diarrhealepisode reduced duration of sickness up to 30% (33). In patients with HIV, zinc deficiency is frequently seen and disease progression is accompanied by decreased serum zinc con-centrations and depressed phytohemagglutinin (PHA) mitogenicresponses (46, 47). These changes are partially reversible by zincsupplementation (48). Likewise,in the murine model of AIDS theamount of zinc in multiple tissues, including the spleen, wasdepressed (49). In contrast, recent dietary analysis of a largecohort of AIDS patients indicated that high zinc intake was asso-ciated with more rapid progression of the disease (50).The actualeffect of zinc supplementation on the progression of AIDS or thegeneral health of AIDS patients remains to be evaluated. Direct effects of zinc on infectious agents In general, it is not clear to what extent the availability of zinc affects in vivo growth of infectious agents themselves. Mostmicroorganisms require zinc in some amount for basic cellularprocesses. For example, yeast (51), P. falciparum (52), and HIV- 1 (53) require zinc for replication and other functions. Duringthe acute phase response zinc is redistributed from plasma to theliver and to lymphocytes (54). It has been suggested that this isan adaptive response intended to deprive invading pathogens ofzinc (54-56). However, lowered plasma zinc concentrationsresulting from the acute phase response are generally well abovethe concentrations at which the growth of most pathogens isaffected (51, 52, 55). Still, highly localized suppression of extra-cellular zinc to microbiostatic concentrations may be created bythe acute phase response in conjunction with calprotectin, a zincbinding protein produced by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (51,57). In contrast, it is also true that very high zinc concentrationscan be microbicidal. For example, the relatively low frequencyof urinary tract infections in men may be due, in part, to the veryhigh microbicidal zinc concentration in semen (58). Moreover,the effect of zinc on the common cold may be due to theincreased zinc concentrations in the nasal mucosa, which mayalter the conformation of the binding site between the virus andICAM-1 (59). The balance between zinc availability or deficiency for host immunity and the invading pathogen is affected by multiple fac-tors. It appears, however, that in most cases any benefit to thepathogen of zinc availability is well compensated for by the con-comitant improvement in host immune function. EFFECTS OF ZINC ON OVERALL IMMUNE FUNCTION Zinc is a potent mediator of host resistance to infection. Because susceptibility to a broad range of pathogenic agents isaffected by zinc, it is likely that multiple immunologic effectors448S SHANKAR AND PRASADDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/68/2/447S/4648668 by guest on 29 June 2020 are involved. The general effects of zinc on innate or nonspecific and adaptive or specific immunity are presented below as aframework for the more detailed discussions of zinc and specificimmunologic effectors presented later. Effects of zinc on barrier and nonspecific immunity Evaluation of the effects of zinc on host immunity must begin with the effect of zinc on components of innate immunity. Zincdeficiency damages epidermal cells, resulting in the characteris-tic skin lesions of acrodermatitis enteropathica or severe zincdeficiency (42, 60). Damage to the linings of the gastrointestinaland pulmonary tracts is also observed during zinc deficiency (9,61). As detailed below,zinc deficiency affects other mediators ofnonspecific immunity, such as polymorphonuclear leukocytefunction (6, 42, 62-64), natural killer cell function (6, 65-67),and complement activity (68). Overview of effects of zinc on specific immunity Lymphopenia is common in zinc-deficient humans and ani- mals and occurs in both the central and peripheral lymphoid tis-sues (9, 10, 69). Adult mice fed zinc-deficient diets for 2 wk hadreduced numbers of T and B lymphocytes in peripheral bloodand spleen tissue (69). Peripheral blood lymphocyte and macro-phage concentrations were eventually reduced by >50% (6, 69).Importantly, even marginal zinc deficiency substantially sup-pressed peripheral blood lymphoid cell concentrations in miceand humans (61, 69-71). Zinc deficiency results not only in decreased lymphocyte con- centrations, but in depressed T and B lymphocyte function (69,72-76). In general, murine T and B lymphocyte proliferativeresponses to mitogens were greatly in zinc-deficientcompared with pair-fed animals (77-79). Suppression rangedfrom 5% to 50% with a tendency for greater suppression in T lymphocytes. Some reports in rat and murine systems, however, docu- mented no effect of zinc deficiency on mitogenic responses oflymphocytes (80, 81). Indeed, some data suggest that the pri-mary effect of zinc deficiency is deletion of T and B lympho-cytes with little loss of function in the surviving cells. This isbased on plaque-forming cell (PFC) assays measuring antibodyproduction in vitro in which data were expressed as PFC perviable splenocytes rather than PFC per whole spleen (81). Thesefindings notwithstanding, it is difficult to explain the effects ofzinc on immunity solely on the grounds of changing cell num-bers. Given the ubiquitous involvement of zinc in cellular events,ranging from gene expression to membrane stability (9, 10, 82),one would expect multiple metabolic and structural defects inthe surviving lymphocytes in zinc-deficient hosts. Effects of high-dose zinc supplementation on immune function Elevated zinc intake has been shown in some cases to potenti- ate immune function above basal levels. In rats, PHA-inducedmitogen responses were increased in animals fed a rich 1000-ppm Zn diet for 14 d compared with a 40-ppm control diet (83).Likewise, mice fed a high-zinc diet had increased numbers ofsplenic PFC in response to T lymphocyte-dependent antigens(25). Additional murine studies confirmed increased T lympho-cyte and macrophage function with supplemental doses of zinc(15). Interestingly, the mice were more also more resistant toendotoxin shock (15). A high-zinc diet also diminished theamount of lipid peroxidation in the livers of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei (84). Studies in humans concerning excess zinc intake on the immune system are few. One study reported that 11 men receiv-ing 300 mg Zn/d, 20 times the recommended dietary allowance(RDA) (9), for 6 wk experienced decreased proliferativeresponses of lymphocytes to PHA and reductions in chemotaxisand phagocytosis of circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes(85). Additional studies suggest that very high zinc intakes inadults and children can result in copper deficiency, anemia,growth retardation, and immunodepression (86-88). One recentstudy of nutritional rehabilitation in marasmic children sug-gested that zinc down-regulated certain monocyte functions (89).Importantly, other larger and longer-term controlled trials ofhigh-dose zinc supplementation in adults did not induceimmunosuppression (90-92). Moreover, deleterious immuno-logic effects were not observed in trials in which clinicallyhealthy and otherwise normal children received daily zinc sup-plementation up to 2 times the RDA. Therefore, short-termintake of zinc several-fold above the RDA is generally consid-ered safe in preschool children and adults (82, 93, 94). It should,however, be mentioned that high-dose zinc supplements given tomouse pups during the perinatal period reduced PFC responses(95), and high doses may also have adverse health effects inhuman neonates (94). As for any nutritional supplement, cautionmust be exercised in taking excessive doses of zinc for prolongedperiods of time. EFFECTS OF FETAL ZINC DEFICIENCY ON IMMUNOLOGIC DEVELOPMENT Gestational zinc deciency in mice and nonhuman primates has short- and long-term deleterious effects on the offspring (96-100).Substantial reductions are seen in lymphoid organ size and gammaglobulin concentrations in pups born to marginally zinc-decientmice. In rhesus monkeys,prenatal zinc deciency led to hypogam-maglobulinemia, reductions in mitogenesis of peripheral bloodlymphocytes, and reduced neutrophil function (101). Additional murine studies showed that many of the immunod- eficiencies observed at birth persisted into adulthood eventhough the pups were fed a diet containing normal amounts ofzinc after weaning. At 6 wk of age, serum IgM concentrationswere only 1% of normal and IgG 2aand IgA concentrations remained 40-60% below normal (96-98). PFCresponse to T-dependent and T-independent antigens wasmarkedly reduced (96-98). Indirect evidence for such effects inhumans is also available. Intrauterine growth retardation, whichhas been linked to maternal zinc deficiency (102), results indepressed cellular immunity that can persist for years (103,104).Furthermore, nutritional deficiencies occurring up to 1 y of agehave resulted in permanent reductions in thymus size (105). The observation that prenatal zinc deficiency in mice results in long-term suppression of IgM, IgA, and IgG 2aconcentrations suggests that a transient prenatal window may exist for thedevelopment of cells producing these antibodies. Indeed, duringimmunologic ontogeny, groups of certain B lymphocytes emergein sequential waves, wave being idiotypically distinct,thereby recognizing specific predefined antigenic determinants(106, 107). Many of these cells produce antibodies of the IgMand IgA isotypes that recognize capsular polysaccharides of bacte-ria and other common pathogens (106). These so-called naturalZINC AND IMMUNE FUNCTION 449SDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/68/2/447S/4648668 by guest on 29 June 2020 antibodies are believed to provide an early line of defense for the immunologically naive neonate against invasive pathogens. Naturalantibodies also influence the developing antibody repertoire of theimmune system. Postnatally, the bone marrow undergoes develop-mental maturation and loses the potential to generate cells secret-ing these antibodies (108). Thus, if gestational zinc deciencyinfluences the development of cells producing such antibodies, theantibody repertoire to bacterial antigens would be permanentlyaltered in adults having experienced transient gestational zincdeprivation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the antibody responses to the common bacterial antigens a-1,3-dextran and phosphoryl- choline in adult mice whose mothers had been moderately deprivedof zinc during late gestation. Adult mice who had been subjected totransient fetal zinc deciency in utero had similar concentrations oftotal serum IgM, but more than 2-fold greater IgM responses tophosphorylcholine and up to 50% lower responses to a-1,3 dextran compared with control animals (AH Shankar, unpublished obser-vations, 1998). The data suggest that transient zinc deciency inutero permanently altered the response to certain bacterial antigens.Moreover, whereas total IgM concentrations were similar in bothsets of animals, the ndings indicate that antibody repertoire ismore sensitive to mild or transient zinc deciency in utero. The potential consequences of altered antibody diversity can be seen in immune responses to 2 common childhood respiratorypathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza . During infection with S. pneumoniae ,children often mount a potent antibody response. However, only certain antibodies are protective,and their absence can result in severe infection or death (107, 109).Likewise, in children it has been shown that among the antibodiesproduced against H. influenza , those of the Hib-id1 idiotype have the greatest antibacterial activity (110). Zinc status may also affect placental transport of antibodies from the mother to the fetus during the last trimester of pregnancy.In contrast with natural antibodies, these maternal antibodies rec-ognize a greater diversity of antigens with high specicity. How-ever,they are not replenished after birth and gradually decay to lowvalues by 6 mo of age. In addition to providing early protection,maternal antibodies also influence qualities of the emergingimmune system in the child (108). Because zinc is important fornormal placental development (111, 112), deciency may result inimpaired in utero acquisition of maternal antibodies by the child aswell. The actual effect of gestational or perinatal zinc deciency ontransfer of maternal antibodies to the child in utero or throughbreast milk in unknown. Perhaps the most remarkable effects of gestational zinc de- ciency is the demonstration in mice that some immunodeciencies,particularly suppressed IgM concentrations, persisted to the sec-ond- and third-generation offspring (96). This suggests that gesta-tional zinc deciency may have epigenetic effects (113). Given thepotential short- and long-term immunologic consequences of evenmoderate gestational zinc deciency, a better understanding of itsinfluence on public health is clearly needed. INFLUENCE OF ZINC ON IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE CONDITIONS Persons suffering from sickle cell anemia have depressed peripheral T lymphocyte numbers,decreased CD4 +-CD8+T lym- phocyte ratios, loss of delayed hypersensitivity, decreased nat-ural killer cell activity, decreased production of the T lympho-cyte cytokine interleukin (IL)-2, and suppressed activity of thy- mulin, a thymic hormone (4, 70, 114, 115). Zinc supplementa-tion restored these immunologic indexes to near normal (69,116). Likewise, in patients with Down syndrome, zinc supple-ments restored immediate hypersensitivity, normalized in vitroassays of lymphocyte function and neutrophil chemotaxis (117),and increased resistance to infection (118). Zinc supplementsalso restored delayed hypersensitivity in alcoholics (119) andstimulated cell-mediated and humoral immunity in humans andmice with hypogammaglobulinemia (25, 120). In elderly humans and animals, impairments in wound heal- ing and resistance to infection were corrected by zinc supple-mentation (121-124), suggesting that immunodeficiency in theelderly is due in part to zinc deficiency. Low plasma zinc con-centrations in elderly patients were associated with peripheralblood lymphopenia, although not with depressed serum IgAconcentrations or responses (125).Zinc supplementation restored normal lymphocyte and neu-trophil zinc concentrations, increased concentrations of circu-lating T lymphocytes, and improved delayed hypersensitivityand IgG antibody responses to tetanus toxoid. As might beexpected, increased resistance to infection was also observed(122, 126-130). EFFECTS OF ZINC ON SPECIFIC CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM As discussed above, zinc deficiency has multiple effects on the immune system. The reader is referred to Figure 1 as a guideto the various effects of zinc deficiency in the context of overallimmunologic development and function. T lymphocytes Development of T lymphocytes Studies of zinc deficiency in bovine (131, 132), porcine (133, 134), rat (135), and murine (5, 6, 73, 77, 136) systems, and inseverely zinc-deficient children (7, 137-140), describe substan-tial reductions in the size of the thymus, the central organ for Tlymphocyte development. Mice maintained on a zinc-deficientdiet for as little as 2 wk showed moderate thymic involution.After 4 wk the thymus retained only 25% of its original size, andat 6 wk only a few thymocytes remained in the thymic capsule(6). The percentage of thymic atrophy exceeded that of otherorgans and the percentage of overall weight loss. The reduction inthymic size and cellularity was observed mostly in the thymiccortex, where immature thymocytes develop. Such changes werenot observed in pair-fed animals, confirming that zinc wasresponsible for the effect (6, 73, 77). After only 1 wk of normalzinc intake, thymic size increased and the cortex was repopulatedwith cells (73). In contrast with the effects of severe zinc restric-tion on thymic size in adult mice, moderate zinc restriction hadminimal effects on thymic size (5). However, marginal zinc defi-ciency in the early postnatal period did result in substantial reduc-tions in thymic size (77). In the peripheral lymphoid organs, T lymphocytes were pro- gressively depleted from the spleen, lymph nodes, and peripheralblood in zinc-deficient animals (6, 69, 73). Zinc-deficient chil-dren with acrodermatitis enteropathica or patients receiving totalparenteral nutrition have reduced numbers of lymphocytes, par-ticularly T lymphocytes in the blood and peripheral lymphoid tis-450S SHANKAR AND PRASADDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/68/2/447S/4648668 by guest on 29 June 2020 sues. Decreased CD4+:CD8+cell ratios are also seen. Recent studies in an experimental human model showed that the per-centage of CD8 +CD73+T lymphocytes, precursors to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, was decreased in zinc deficiency (141). Thepresence of the CD73 molecule on cytotoxic T lymphocytes isrequired for antigen recognition, proliferation, and cytolysis(141). These and the previously mentioned changes are reversedwith zinc supplementation (7, 32, 65, 138, 141-144). T lymphocyte function T lymphocyte responses such as delayed hypersensitivity and cytotoxic activity are suppressed during zinc deficiency andreversed by zinc supplementation (6, 7, 32, 137, 142, 144, 145).Suppressed delayed hypersensitivity responses in malnourishedchildren are also restored after zinc supplementation (139, 140,146, 147). In one study in children, synergism between zinc andvitamin A tended to potentiate the T-lymphocyte proliferativeresponse to tuberculin (145). Patients receiving total parenteralnutrition devoid of zinc had reduced T lymphocyte PHAresponses (65, 142, 143), which returned to normal after 20 d ofzinc supplementation. The influence of zinc on T-dependent anti-body production and T lymphocyte cytokine production patternsare discussed below in the sections titled B lymphocytes andcytokines, respectively. In vitro effects of zinc on T lymphocytes Several in vitro studies showed that zinc is required for T lym- phocyte proliferation in response to IL-1 (148), PHA, con-canavalin A, or IL-2 (149-152). Proliferation of human T lym-phocytes was enhanced by zinc when stimulated with mitogenicconcentrations of PHA, concanavalin A, or phorbol ester (153).Moreover, the mitogen response of cells from zinc-deficientpatients could be improved by addition of 10 mmol ZnCl 2/L in vitro. Zinc also restored proliferative T lymphocyte responses inthe presence of high concanavalin A concentrations, 20 mg/mL, which are known to be suppressive. One murine study found noeffect when zinc chloride was added to spleen cell cultures con-taining subactivating concentrations of PHA or concanavalin A(154). In contrast, zinc potentiated the suppression of mitogenesis caused by phorbol ester pretreatment (155). Inanother experimental system, zinc suppressed the allogeneic pro-liferative response of human T lymphocytes to HeLa cells (153). It was also shown that zinc can potentiate the response to some bacterial superantigens by facilitating binding between the superanti-gen and class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (156,157). Theclinical signicance of this phenomenon,including the role of zinc inthe development of toxic shock during sepsis, requires further study. Lastly, there is also evidence that zinc addition in vitro alters the expression, function, or both, of lymphocyte surface molecules gov-erning cell-cell interactions. The addition of zinc chloride at mmol/L levels enhanced the rosetting of peripheral blood T lymphocytes withsheep erythrocytes. This effect was mediated at the T because pretreatment of the lymphocytes themselves,but not thesheep erythrocytes,had the same effect (158). It was also reported thatzinc enhanced the transcription and expression of the adhesion mole-cule ICAM-1 on the surface of lymphoid cells, but not on broblasts(159). The in vitro studies make apparent the many roles played by zinc in T lymphocyte activation and proliferation. The effects of zincon T lymphocytes are modulated by factors such as the antigenpresenting cell type, adhesion molecules, co-stimulatory mole-cules, antigen type, and the overall milieu in which T lympho- cyte activation occurs. B lymphocytes Development of B lymphocytes B lymphocyte development in bone marrow is adversely affected by zinc deficiency (160-162). When mice were fed amarginally zinc-deficient diet for just 30 d, nucleated bone mar-row cells were reduced by one third with preferential reductionin small nongranular cells. Total B lymphocytes and their pre-cursors were reduced nearly 75%. Losses were predominantly inpre-B and immature B lymphocytes, which declined by <50% and 25%,respectively. Mature B lymphocytes were less affected.This finding is consistent with the previously mentioned studywherein spleen cells remaining in zinc-deficient mice appearedfunctionally normal (81) with typical markers of T and B lym-phocyte maturation (163). Thus, zinc deficiency blocks develop-ment of B lymphocytes in the marrow, resulting in fewer B lym-phocytes in the spleen. B lymphocyte function B lymphocyte antibody responses are inhibited by zinc defi- ciency (5, 73, 164, 165). As previously mentioned, gross effectsof zinc deficiency on B lymphocyte mitogen and plaque-form-ing responses have been observed. Zinc is required for the B lymphocyte mitogenic and cytokine response to lipopolysac-charide (156, 166). In vitro antibody production, determined byPFC assay, was strongly inhibited in splenic B lymphocytesfrom zinc-deficient mice (72). Interestingly, T-dependent antibody responses are more affected by zinc deficiency than are T-independent ones. ThePFC responses to the T-dependent antigen sheep red bloodcells and T-independent antigen dextran were reduced by 90%(72, 73) and 50% (69, 79, 167), respectively, in zinc-deficientmice. Similar differences in effects were seen in moderatelyzinc-deficient animals (72, 73). In 1 study, mild zinc defi-ciency affected antibody responses to T-dependent antigensbut not T-independent antigens (71). When zinc-deficient micewere returned a normal diet, IgM PFC activity recoveredwithin 1 wk, although restoration of IgG PFC activity required1 mo, suggesting that greater perturbations in B or T lympho-cyte functions are required for isotype switching (73, 164). T lymphocyte-mediated effects of zinc deficiency on B lym-phocyte activity were also shown by restoration of PFCresponses after infusion of normal thymocytes into zinc-defi-cient mice (72). In zinc-deficient mice infected with P. yoelii, antiparasite IgM concentrations were not affected,although IgGconcentrations were suppressed nearly 10-fold (AH Shankar,unpublished observations, 1998). These findings are consistentwith the idea that T-dependent B lymphocyte functions are moreaffected than T-independent ones. This is further supported bythe observation that B lymphocytes are less dependent on zincfor proliferation than are T lymphocytes (168, 169). It is also important to note that zinc-deficient mice had reduced antibody recall responses to T-dependent and T-inde-pendent antigens for which they had previously been immu-nized (69, 164, 165, 170), implying that immunologic mem-ory is affected by zinc status. The potentially importanteffect of this for maintenance of vaccine efficacy in humans remains unexplored.ZINC AND IMMUNE FUNCTION 451SDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/68/2/447S/4648668 by guest on 29 June 2020 In vitro effects of zinc on B lymphocytes As for T lymphocytes, in vitro zinc-induced polyclonal of human B lymphocytes from blood,spleen,and lymph nodeswas reported (171). These effects may, however, be secondary tozinc activation of helper T lymphocytes. In contrast with the effectson T lymphocytes, rosette formation between murine B lymphocytes and erythrocytes was inhibited when B lympho-cytes were precultured with zinc in the presence of zinc ionophore,indicating that receptor down-regulation had occurred (172). Natural killer cells Studies in humans and animals describe decreased natural killer cell activity in zinc deficient states (6, 65), although 1study reported increased natural killer cell activity (66). Naturalkiller cell function was depressed after in vivo treatment of cellswith 1,10-phenanthroline, a zinc chelator, and the depression wasreversed by the readdition of zinc, but not of calcium or magne-sium (65). Exogenous zinc also stimulated production of inter-feron g by human peripheral blood natural killer cells (67, 173).However, exposure of natural killer cells to high concentrations of zinc in vitro inhibited cytotoxicity by rendering target cellsmore resistant to damage (66, 174). This and other reports ofzinc-mediated inhibition (66) of natural killer cell activity maybe partially explained by the recent demonstration that the killercell inhibitory receptor requires zinc (175). The zinc-induceddown-regulation of CD16, one of the Fc g antibody receptor sub- types on natural killer cells, may also be due to a zinc-dependentmetalloprotease (176). Overall, the in vitro data are consistentwith the decreased natural killer cell activity seen in zinc-defi-cient animals and humans (6, 61, 65). Neutrophils Polymorphonuclear leukocyte function is altered in zinc-defi- cient animals and patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica andother types of zinc deficiency.

Unfortunately, the effects ofzinc deficiency on microbicidal functions such as total oxygenproduction, phagocytosis, and extravasation remain to be ade-quately evaluated. Monocytes and macrophages Effects on monocyte and macrophage function have been observed during zinc deciency In humans,the chemo-tactic response of monocytes from acrodermatitis enteropathicapatients is suppressed and can be restored after addition of zinc invitro (42, 62). Monocytes from zinc-decient mice have impairedkilling of intracellular parasites, which is rapidly corrected in vitroby addition of zinc (178). Reduced macrophage phagocytosis ofCandidahas also been observed in zinc-decient animals (15, 25). In other studies, however, the ability of macrophages from zinc-decient rodents to phagocytose particles was either enhanced(179, 182) and accompanied by greater numbers of cells bearingFcg and complement receptors (179), or remained unchanged (183). High concentrations of zinc in vitro inhibited macrophageactivation, mobility, phagocytosis, and oxygen consumption (65,184,185). When marasmic children were rehabilitated with a zinc-containing regimen, monocyte phagocytic and fungicidal activitywas suppressed (89). Because elevated zinc concentrations caninhibit complement activation (68), complement-mediated phago-cytosis may be adversely affected by high zinc concentrations.Additional studies are clearly needed for a better understanding ofthe conditions under which zinc affects monocyte and macrophagephagocytosis. There is much speculation regarding the role of zinc in the killing of pathogens by oxygen radicals produced by macrophages. With theexception of 1 report (186), available data do not provide evidencelinking zinc status with macrophage production of oxygen radicals(21,165,180). Unfortunately,data regarding the effects of zinc on theproduction of other microbicidal radicals,ie,nitric oxide,are lacking.It was proposed that the product of the Nramp gene in mice, respon- sible monella typhimurium nitric oxide-mediated microbicidal activity b, IL-6, interferon a (IFN- a) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF- a), were stimulated by addition of zinc in vitro (188-190). However, zinc deciencyenhanced human monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity against target cells,which returned to normal after zinc supplementation (65). Zinc deciency suppressed macrophage support of mitogen- induced T lymphocyte proliferation (181). Although inhibition ofmitogenesis was due to effects on both macrophages and T lym-phocytes, suppression of macrophage function occurred earlier inthe onset of zinc deciency. Moreover, macrophage activity wascorrected within 30 min of incubation with zinc salts in vitro. Therapid restoration of certain macrophage functions after zinc additionsuggests that rapid therapeutic effects of zinc supplementation ondiarrhea or the common cold may involve some aspects of macro-phage function. Moreover, there may be greater benet of zinc sup-plementation for infections in which specic macrophage functionsare central to resistance. Unfortunately, there is limited informa- tion concerning the effects of zinc on microbicidal or immuno-logic functions of macrophages in humans,including phagocyto-sis, free radical production, antigen processing, antigen presen- tation, and cytokine production. EFFECTS OF ZINC STATUS ON SOLUBLE MEDIATORS OF IMMUNITY Glucocorticoids The release of glucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal glands can result in certain physiologic changes, such as thymic atrophy,that are reminiscent of Because zincdeciency raises blood glucocorticoid concentrations (194-196),thymic atrophy may be mediated, in part, by glucocorticoids.Indeed, when adrenalectomized mice were fed a zinc-decientdiet for up to 6 wk,changes in thymic weight were small or absent(196). In addition,when adult mice were given a slow-release cor-ticosteroid implant, thymus size was reduced >than 80% (161).Steroid-implanted also showed large reductions in pre-B andimmature B lymphocytes in bone marrow (161, 197), suggestingthat the effects of zinc deciency on early B lymphocyte develop-ment may also involve glucocorticoids. The contribution of glucocorticoids to the effects of zinc de- ciency must,however,be interpreted with caution. Zinc deciencyhas profound effects on human thymocytes, which are relativelyresistant to glucocorticoids (196). In addition, although thy-mus of zinc-decient adrenalectomized mice remained normal insize, medullary areastill occurred in adrenalectomized mice, zincdeciency reduced IgM and IgG PFC responses to sheep red bloodcells, 50% of the loss in T lymphocyte helper function in controlanimals occurred before detectable increases in plasma corticos-terone (196). Last, in marginally zinc-decient mice, loss of lym-phocytes in the spleen, depressed immunity, and decreased IL-2production were observed despite the absence of thymic shrinkageor increased glucocorticoid concentrations (69, cells. Thymulin tohigh-affinity on T lymphocytes and promotes T lym-phocyte maturation, cytotoxicity, and IL-2 production (198).Zinc is bound to in a 1:1 stoichiometry via the sidechains of asparagine the hydroxyl groups of the 2 serines(199). Thymulin activity,in vitro and in vivo in both animals andhumans, is dependent on plasma zinc concentrations such thatmarginal changes in zinc intake or availability affect thymulinactivity (32,70,120,200-203). Thymulin is readily detectable inthe serum of zinc-deficient patients, but is not active (70). Thebinding of zinc results in a conformational change that pro-duces the active form of thymulin (200). The overall role ofthymulin on the immunologic lesions caused by zinc defi-ciency has not been well studied. The use of thymulin as anindicator of zinc deficiency has been suggested, although thy-mulin concentration is also modulated by zinc-independentfactors. Assays regarding zinc status and thymulin zinc satura-tion may prove more useful, much as the index of transferrinsaturation provides useful information regarding iron status. Cytokines Cytokines, also known as interleukins, are key messengers of immunologic cells that regulate multiple aspects of leukocyte ZINC AND IMMUNE FUNCTION 453SDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/68/2/447S/4648668 by guest on 29 June 2020 biology. Their effects are mediated through corresponding receptors on target cells. Production or biological activity ofmultiple cytokines migration inhibitory factor) influencing the devel- opment and function of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, macro-phages, and natural killer cells is affected by zinc deficiency.The cytokines IL-1 (204), IL-2 (71, 76, 204), IL-4 (26, 188),and IFN- g (67) have been reported to be suppressed during zinc deficiency. A decline in IL-2 receptor expression has beenobserved in some (76, 152), but not all (71), studies. The aminoacid sequence of IL-3 contains an active zinc binding site that isimportant for activity (205). Further studies are needed to deter-mine the in vivo role of zinc in modulating IL-3 activity. Zincalso plays a critical role in the dimerization of IFN- anecessary for its activity (206). Confirming the general inhibitory effectsof zinc deficiency on cytokine production in vivo, in vitro addi-tion of 1,10-phenanthroline reversibly inhibited antigen-stimu-lated production of migration inhibitory factor from lympho-cytes (20, 25, 207). As previously mentioned, monocyteproduction of cytokines IL-1 b, IL-6, IFN- a, and TNF- awas stimulated by the addition of zinc in vitro (188-190, 204). T helper cells can be categorized as Th1 and Th2 cells,accord- ing to their functions in cell-mediated (Th1) and antibody-medi-ated (Th2) immunity. These subsets are well characterized in themurine immune system, where IL-2, IFN- g, IL-4,IL-5,IL-6,IL-10,and IL-13 are products of Th2 cells (208). Although not as clear cut inhumans, segregated T lymphocyte production of cytokines cell-associated tend to suppress macro-phage while promoting pro-duction of the noncytophilic IgG isotypes and IgE (208). In an experimental human model, we showed recently that the production of IFN- g was decreased whereas the production of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 was not affected during zinc deciency (209). Ear-lier studies in experimental human model subjects and in patientswith sickle cell disease and head and neck cancer showed a signi-cant effect of zinc deciency on IL-2 activity (70,210). In summary,the studies showed that even mild zinc deciency in humans may beaccompanied by an imbalance of Th1 cell and Th2 cell function,resulting in dysregulated resistance to infection. CELL BIOLOGY OF ZINC IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM General cell biology of zinc Zinc is present in the body almost exclusively as Zn 2+bound to cellular proteins. Zinc has a high affinity for electrons,enabling interactions with several amino acid side chains. Inter-actions, especially with sulfur and nitrogen atoms in the aminoacids cysteine and histidine, respectively, enable zinc to cross-link remote regions within and between polypeptides to modifytertiary protein structure and function. Given this ability, its rel-ative nontoxicity, and the fact that it does not engage in damag-ing redox reactions, zinc is ideally suited to play a central role inintracellular metabolism. The zinc content within lymphocytes, 150 pmol/10 6periph- eral blood lymphocytes (211), is typical of most cells in thebody. It is thought that activated lymphocytes take up zinc viamultiple mechanisms, including receptors for zinc-transferrin, albumin, a2-macroglobulin, and metallothionein, the major zinc binding protein of the body (9, 149, 212-214) Zinc uptake also involves other less well characterized mecha- nisms such as anionic channels or transporters (215). Recently,zinc transporters and channels mediating both the inward and out-ward movement of zinc were isolated from mammalian cells(216, 217). The continued study of these transporters and chan-nels will help elucidate the mechanisms of zinc homeostasiswithin cells. In rats,a system for transport of zinc into the nucleusis suggested by the rapid appearance of 65Zn in the nucleus of spleen cells within 2 h of intragastric feeding with 65Zn (218). Role of zinc in the cell cycle of lymphocytes When lymphocytes were treated with PHA or concanavalin A, within several hours there was a rapid increase in cellular zinc(10, 219-221). These findings are consistent with studies indi-cating a requirement for zinc during mid to late G1 phase in pro-motion of thymidine kinase expression (222),and in another lesswell defined step involved in cell transition to S phase (223). Thezinc-dependent activity of DNA polymerase may account in partfor the influence of zinc during S phase (224). Zinc may alsoplay a role in transition to the G2 and M phases. A greater pro-portion of S compared with G2 phase cells were observed inPHA-stimulated lymphocytes from mildly zinc-deficient patientssuffering from sickle cell anemia (116). The ratio returned tonormal after a period of zinc supplementation (116). The Mphase of the cell cycle may also be affected by zinc deficiencybecause defective tubulin polymerization is seen in tissues fromzinc-deficient animals (225, 226), and zinc is known to bind theamino-terminal of tubulin, thereby stabilizing microtubule for-mation (225, 226). Mechanisms underlying the effect of zinc on cell replication Zinc influences the activity of multiple enzymes at the basic levels of replication and transcription, as shown in Figure 2.These include DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase, DNA-depen-dent synthetase (220,222,227-231),andthe family of transcriptional regulators known as zinc finger DNAbinding proteins (232, 233). In addition, zinc forms the activeenzymatic sites of many metalloproteases (232, 233). The activity of the major enzyme regulating DNA replication, DNA polymerase, is zinc dependent. It is inhibited by zinc defi-ciency and zinc chelators and is enhanced by addition of lowconcentrations of zinc in vitro (229). Thymidine kinase, crucialfor phosphorylated pyrimidines, is CMYC(219, 234, 235). such as NF k-B (236), met- allothionein transcription factor 1 (237), and RING (238), con-tain zinc finger-like domains that are influenced by changes inintracellular pools of zinc. In addition, zinc deprivation affectsthe activity of RNA polymerase (230) needed for transcription. Role of zinc in lymphocyte activation Zinc also plays a role in multiple aspects of T lymphocyte activation and signal transduction (239) as detailed in Figure 2.Zinc is implicated in the noncovalent interaction of the cytoplas-454S SHANKAR AND PRASADDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/68/2/447S/4648668 by guest on 29 June 2020 mic tails of CD4 and CD8 with the tyrosine kinase p56lck,a n essential protein in the early steps of T lymphocyte activation.Through this and possibly other pathways, zinc stimulatesautophosphorylation of tyrosine residues by p56 lckand subsequent phosphorylation of the T lymphocyte receptor complex involvingCD45 (240, 241). Zinc is then involved in the activity of phos-pholipase C to give rise to inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol(242). In addition, zinc affects the phosphorylation of proteinsmediated by protein kinase C (243). Subsequent changes throughprotein phosphorylation regulate activation and cell proliferation. Influence of zinc on apoptosis The major mechanism of cell death in the body and in culture is apoptosis,a form of cell suicide characterized by a decrease incell volume, dramatic condensation of the chromatin and cyto-plasm, and fragmentation of nuclear DNA (244). Apoptosis is a normal physiologic process enabling a variety of importantprocesses from epithelial turnover to T and B lymphocyte devel-opment (245). The dysregulation of such a basic process would,therefore, have important health consequences. Zinc-deficient animals exhibit enhanced spontaneous and toxin-induced apoptosis in multiple cell types (243, 246-249).As previously discussed, zinc thymic atrophy is a central featureof zinc deficiency. It is now known that this atrophy is accompa-nied by apoptotic cell death of thymocytes (160). Several studiesshowed that zinc is a regulator apoptosis supplementation decreased mycotoxin-induced lymphocytes in mice (250). In addition,zinc administration to mice 48 h before intraperitoneal injectionof lipopolysaccharide greatly abrogated subsequent apoptoticZINC AND IMMUNE FUNCTION 455S FIGURE2.

In vitro, greater numbers of lymphocytes and thymocytes undergoapoptosis when cultured with a zinc-free medium or withzinc chelators (253-255). Conversely, apoptosis of T lympho-cytes induced by in vitro exposure to toxins (250) and otheragents (243) is prevented by the addition of high concentrationsof zinc salts. Cells can also be rescued from apoptosis with phys-iologic concentrations of zinc salts (5-25 mmol/L) if uptake is facilitated by the zinc ionophore pyrithione (253). It has beensuggested that zinc is a major intracellular regulator of apoptosisbecause lymphocytes maintain intracellular zinc at concentra-tions slightly above those needed to suppress apoptosis (256). Inaddition, a dose-responsive relation is seen between intracellularzinc concentrations and the degree of susceptibility to apoptosis(10, 256). The subcellular mechanisms whereby zinc affects apoptosis are not well understood, but it is likely that zinc acts at multiplelevels. There was a good correlation between inhibition ofCa 2+/Mg2+DNA activity and Although in vivo apoptosis by preventing the of (126, 259, 260). Likewise, poly (ADP-ribose) poly-merase, the enzyme, interacts phocytes undergoing apoptosis, cytoplasmic zinc increasessignificantly, possibly originating from release of zinc fromnuclear proteins (263). Role of zinc as an antioxidant Zinc has other properties that could contribute to its role in lymphocyte function. It is an antioxidant, protecting cells fromthe damaging effects of oxygen radicals generated duringimmune activation (264, 265). Zinc also regulates the expressionin lymphocytes of metallothionein and metallothionein-like pro-teins with antioxidant activity (213, 266). Membrane zinc con-centrations are strongly influenced by dietary zinc deficiencyand supplementation (267, 268). Zinc concentrations in cellmembranes appear to be important in preserving their integritythrough poorly defined mechanisms involving binding to thiolategroups (265). It is noteworthy that zinc release from thiolatebonds can prevent lipid peroxidation (269). In addition, nitricoxide induces zinc release from metallothionein, the primaryzinc binding and transport protein in the body, which may limitfree radical membrane damage during inflammation. Indeed,zinc supplementation has been shown to prevent pulmonarypathology due to hyperoxia in rats (270). DISCUSSION The studies presented herein represent the scope of zinc-medi- ated effects on infectious disease and immune function.Although the effects of zinc deficiency on immunity are pro-found and ubiquitous, it is remarkable that greater effects onhealth are not observed in marginally zinc-deficient populations.This may be partially explained by the redundancy of immuno-logic effectors compensating for suboptimal function of any oneeffector. However,it is also clear that not all aspects of immunityor infections are affected equally by zinc deficiency. For exam-ple,in vitro intracellular killing by macrophages is very sensitiveto zinc deficiency and is restored rapidly after supplementation. T lymphocyte-macrophage interactions are less sensitive to zincdeficiency and macrophage phagocytosis is the least sensitive.Thus, infections in which macrophage killing is a central effec-tor, such as malaria or tuberculosis, may be more sensitive tozinc deficiency. Likewise, zinc deficiency may have greatereffects on infections requiring T lymphocyte-dependent anti-body responses and those in which IgG is crucial for protection.Infections for which T lymphocyte-independent responses aresufficient may be less affected. In the case of T lymphocytes,infections for which Th1 cytokines, eg, IFN- g, are needed for resistance, may be more affected by zinc deficiency. It is alsoclear that development of immunologic cells is most sensitive tozinc deficiency during the perinatal period, indicating that this isa crucial window of intervention. Future directions Continued understanding of how zinc influences the immune sys- tem and alters host resistance to infection will depend on greaterintegration of modern immunology, molecular biology, and cellularbiochemistry into laboratory and eld-based studies. A few specicareas are detailed below that represent only a small fraction of theimmunologic processes for which major gaps remain in the knowl-edge of zinc immunobiology. Although adhesion molecules play a major role in cell-to-cell interaction, the influence of zinc on their function remains mostlyunexplored. Given the role of zinc in the tertiary structure of proteins,it is likely that zinc deciency may affect adhesion molecule func-tion. Likewise,we know very little about how zinc might affect lym-phocyte trafcking in the body. With regard to macrophage function, it is still not clear how zinc influences the ability of the cell to engulf and kill organisms.Additional studies examining the effects of zinc on nitric oxideand oxygen radical production would, therefore, be useful. Therole of zinc in antigen digestion and presentation to T lympho-cytes is unknown. With respect to B lymphocyte function, the processes of isotype switching and afnity maturation are crucial to optimal antibody-mediated resistance to infection. Knowledge of the influence of zincon antibody afnity would also provide information relevant to vac-cine efcacy. For both T and B lymphocytes, the role of zinc in thedevelopment of memory cells is potentially important for vaccineefcacy and needs to be further explored. As indicated for macro-phages, the role of zinc in the antigen processing and presentationfunctions of B lymphocytes is completely unknown. It is clear that zinc plays a major role in immunologic ontogeny and development of the antigen-recognition repertoire. In addi-tion, subsets of T and B lymphocytes as and CD5 B lymphocytes limited antigenic than theirconventional polyclonal T and B lymphocyte to the pleural and peritoneal cavities and intestinalepithelium provides a rapid response against invading organisms.The effects of zinc on development of these cells and their func-tion remains unknown. As detailed elsewhere in this supplement(271), the health effects of gestational zinc deprivation are poten-tially far-reaching and need to be fully explored given the possiblelong term or even generational effects on populations. Concerning cytokines and T lymphocyte regulation, the semi- nal work by Prasad et al (209, 210) concerning the influence of456S SHANKAR AND PRASADDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/68/2/447S/4648668 by guest on 29 June 2020 zinc on Th1 and Th2 regulation provides a foundation on which to build. Little is known regarding effects of zinc on cytokineactivation of cells because most studies have focused on cytokinesecretion. Moreover, most of the studies of T and B lymphocyteshave used mitogens for cell activation. Studies are needed thatexamine lymphocyte activation in response to the more physio-logic antigen driven responses involving all aspects of cell adhe-sion, co-stimulation, and cytokine activation. It will be important to apply knowledge of the immunologic mechanisms modulated by zinc deficiency to the design of ther-apies and public health interventions involving targeted zinc sup-plementation for certain diseases or high-risk groups. By exten-sion, it would be useful to identify the specific immunologiclesions caused by zinc deficiency responsible for altered hostresistance in natural infections and in experimental infectiousdisease models. The role of zinc in immunity and the biologicalbasis of altered resistance to infection will no doubt be fruitfullyexplored as researchers continue to integrate knowledge andtechniques from diverse disciplines to examine the effects onzinc on immunity, health, and disease.
