Dizziness and balance problems or vestibular problems are the third most common complaint to primary physicians after headaches and back pain. Over 90 million Americans have experienced a balance problem.

These injuries often result in severely reduced physical activity and loss of strength and flexibility. This leads to a heightened risk of injury. Even if people with balance problems don't injure themselves, they often seriously limit their activities simply because they are afraid of falling or becoming dizzy. If you are one of these people, it's time to take action and return to a full, active lifestyle.
