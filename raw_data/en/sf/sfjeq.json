State law requires providers to notify Public Health of any suspected measles cases. Providers collect specimens and coordinate with Public Health to arrange testing at Washington or Oregon public health labs. Public Health staff interview the case/parents of the case to gather information about illness onset and where the case had been the previous 21 days. Used to identify where the case may have been exposed and where they may have been while contagious. Case and contact investigation 2/27/19 Public Health measles response 61Case at a large public setting while contagious: Notify public through news releases, website and social media Case at school while contagious: Identify susceptible students and staff Exclude from school and other public settings for 21 days Actively monitor for 21 days (daily calls) Case at a health care facility while contagious: Obtain list and contact information of exposed patients and contact them Identify those who are susceptible and actively monitor for 21 days (home quarantine, daily calls) If < 72 hours after exposure provide, MMR for exposed susceptible children and susceptible non -pregnant adults If < six days after exposure provide IG for infants, susceptible pregnant women and immunocompromised Identify whether anyone else was present/exposed and contact themTaliSharot Correct approach is to assess the new information in light of what you already know about the world. Four factors that determine whether we are going to change our beliefs: 1.Old belief 2.Confidence in that belief 3.New data 4.Confidence in that data On average, not a bad approach.
