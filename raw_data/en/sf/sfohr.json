Its Greek roots are obvious: logos means thought , particularly rational thought, and phobos means fear of . Logophobia is defined as \"a doctrine about rationality . . . [where] rationality can- not be an objective constraint on us but is just whatever we make it, and what we make it depends on what we value.\" Moreover, the definition continues, \"Opponents are held to disguise their self-interested construction of rational- ity behind a metaphysically inflated view of rationality in which Reason with a capital R is supposed to transcend the merely empirical selves of rational beings.\" Do you know of any logopho- bics among your acquaintances? The term was introduced\u2014obviouslyin jest\u2014by philosopher Nicholas Shackel in (pub- lished April 2005, pp. 295-320). Shackel's paper is actually a serious, and at times rather technical, critique of the modus operandi of postmodernist (and decon- structionist and anti-rationalist feminist) authors as Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Francois Lyotard, David Bloor, Richard Rorty, and Stanley Fish, to mention a few of the major offenders. But the list might as well include names perhaps more relevant to readers of thispublication, for instance creationist/- IDers Kent Hovind, Ken Ham, Duane Behe, \"gurus\" like Deepak Chopra, paranor- malists like Uri Geller, psychics like Sylvia Browne, or vaccination-deniers such as Jenny McCarthy (and her new unconscionable sponsor, OprahWinfrey). According to Shackel, logophobics have developed an arsenal of strategies to obfuscate clear thinking, which they deploy whenever pressed by a skeptic. For instance, consider Foucault's classic thesis that there is no such thing as sci- entific truth because truth is a reflectionLogophobia Logophobics have developed an arsenal of strategies to obfuscate clear thinking, which they deploy whenever pressed by a skeptic. Massimo Pigliucci is professor of philoso- phy at the City University of New York- Lehman College, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Sci- ence, and author of Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism and the Nature of Science .

This is apparently strong stuff, but it becomes a much milder statement when Foucault later tells us what he means by truth : \"'T ruth' is to be under- stood as a system of ordered procedures for the production, regulation, distribu- tion, circulation and operation of state- ments.\" Really? And here I was thinking all along that truth means an accurate description of an observer-independent reality. Silly me. Shackel calls this sort of move a \"troll truism,\" \"a mildly ambiguous statement by which an exciting falsehood may trade on a trivial truth.\" It is a particular form of Humpty-Dumptying, a term derived from the character in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass who\u2014after Alice points out that he is arbitrarily switching word meanings in the middle of their discussion\u2014fa- mously tells her: \"When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean\u2014 neither more nor less.'' Examples of Humpty-Dumptyinglitter the pseudoscientific landscape, for instance in discussions of the ever more vacuous concept of \"irreducible com- plexity,\" a supposed intellectual corner- stone of the modern intelligent design movement, alleged proof that evolution cannot occur by natural processes. Michael Behe's original definition went something like this: \"A single system composed of several well-matched, inter- acting parts that contribute to the basic function of the system, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning\" (Darwin's Black Box , p. 39). The problem with this, as philosopher Niall Shanks and biologist Karl Joplin immediately pointed out, is that a currently \"irreducible\" struc- ture can easily result from a natural and gradual historical process, the alleged irre- ducibility appearing later on as a byprod- uct of said historical process. Not to worry, Behe simply changed his definition to overcome the problem: \"An irreducibly complex evolutionary pathway is one that contains one or more unselected steps (that is, one or more necessary-but-unselected muta- tions)\" (\"A Response to Critics of Darwin's Black Box \" by Michael Behe, Progress in Complexity, Information and Design , Volume 1.1, January-March, 2002). Notice that Behe switched from defining a property applicable to cur-rently existing biological systems to the property of a historical pathway , i.e., of a chain of events that has already occurred. This moves the target into rather unas- sailable territory because it turns irre- ducible complexity into an argument from ignorance (Behe's in particular). Logophobia, I maintain, is a broad condition that can strike adult human beings of all ages, genders, and cultural backgrounds, especially when they have never been seriously exposed to the basics of critical thinking or when they have grown up in the thrall of a powerful ideo- logical system. The disease is preventable by early education, though this requires painful effort on the part of teachers and students alike. Once the subject is past middle school it becomes increasingly dif- ficult, and in most cases essentially impos- sible, to provide a cure, and huge amounts of financial resources and time are wasted as a result. Occasionally, lives are lost as a direct outcome of logophobia, especially when the logophobic is a politician with the power to start a war or a celebrity pushing an anti-medical health agenda. Needless to say, fighting the spread of logophobia is a primary responsibil- ity of every critically thinking person despite the unfavorable odds, which is why thorough knowledge of the disease and of its symptoms is so crucial.
