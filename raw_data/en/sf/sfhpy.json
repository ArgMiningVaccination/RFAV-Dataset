In the beginning most of our wares consisted of handwoven Mexican baskets and handicrafts, as well as Grateful Dead merchandise. The name was suggested by our founder Pete Erskine's brother, as inspired by the Grateful Dead song (Mexicali Blues). Since then, Mexicali Blues has become more than just a name, it is a brand, an identity, and a lifestyle. We now responsibly import clothing, jewelry, and home decor from eight different countries, not just Mexico, but our name stuck and hey, we like it that way.
