Albert Einstein '(L)aws are not abstract propositions. They are expressions of policy arising out of specific situations and addressed to the attainment of particular ends.' Justice Felix Frankfurter 'The main aim of communication is clarity and simplicity. Usually they go together\u2014 but not always. 'Communication is always understood in the context and experience of the receiver\u2014- no matter what was intended. 'If unnecessary things add to clarity or simplicity they should be retained.' Edward De Bono 'Legislation should be written so that it is feasible for the ordinary person of ordinary intelligence and ordinary education to have a reasonable expectation of understanding and comprehending legislation and of getting the answers to the questions he or she has. 'We need to balance two important principles. The first is that clarity of language should be an aim in itself, so that the ordinary person can have a reasonable expectation of being able to comprehend legislation. The second is that the clarity of the language should enhance and not detract from the legal policy and the substance of the legislation. In the end result, clarity of language should assist with the development and formulation of legislative policy.' Dennis Murphy QC Words and Phrases: A Guide to Pl ain Legal Language February 2023 v How to use this guide The entries Words and phrases are listed in alphabetical order and cross- referenced to other entries if appropriate. How entries are arranged Entries are listed in alphabetical order, arranged on a letter-by-letter basis. In a letter-by-letter arrangement, spaces are ignored in entries consisting of 2 or more words. For example: all allay (ie allay) allege (ie alle...) all ... not (ie alln...) allocate (ie alloc...) all of (ie allof) allowed (ie allow...). If a phrase contains 2 or more alternative words, only the first alternative is taken into account in working out the order of entries. For example, in the following phrases the second alternative 'are' is disregarded: is/are not to (ie isn...) is/or (ie iso...) is/are required to (ie isr...). What each entry consists of usage try extra information examples of no change examples of change further reading Each main entry contains a usage recommendation and suggested alternatives. Suggested alternative words and phrases appear in italic type. Some suggested alternatives have an arrow before them (eg remove as a suggested alternative for abate). This means there is an entry for the suggested alternative. Check this entry before using the alternative. Not all alternatives are synonyms for the main entry. There may be other words that may work in the context or suggestions to recast or omit. Recasting may involve changing the narrative in the provision. How to use this guide Words and Phrases: A Gu ide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 vi Extra information, examples of change and no change and references to relevant texts (under the heading 'further reading') are also included in many entries. In an entry containing an example of change, the changed words are struck through (eg abated ) and the alternative words are underlined (eg reduced). Macquarie Dictionary Though it is not listed under 'further reading', the Macquarie Dictionary is the primary source to be used when drafting ACT legislation. Model laws The following usage recommendations are not intended to apply to ACT legislation that adopts or is based on model law. Usage recommendations There are 3 recommendations for usage: never use avoid using consider alternatives never use Practice The word or phrase must never be used. Example construe usage \u2014never use try\u2014interpret / omitting / recasting example of change 1 in a proceeding to construe inte rpret a will, evidence of the testator's intention further reading Fowler's English Usage pp 175- 6 (construct /construe ) How to use this guide Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 vii avoid using Practice If possible, avoid using the word or phrase. Example forward [as a verb ] usage \u2014avoid using try\u2014send / give extra information 1 Except to mean send on, prefer send or give . example of no change 1 For this Act, sell means send, forward or deliver for sale. example of change 1 forward give a copy of the claim to the fund manager further reading Gowers' Plain Word s p 230 Howard's Guide p 174 Howard's Handbook p 175 Longman English Usage p 294 consider alternatives Practice Before using the word or phrase, consider the alternatives. The alternatives are generally preferred, but always consider whether they are appropriate. Some entries include the option of omitting the word in question. Prefer brevity and omit the word or phrase if the meaning remains the same. 'No change' may be given as an option, but do this only if the alternative words are inappropriate. Example get usage \u2014consider alternatives try\u2014recasting (using more specific words, eg become / buy / obtain / receive / take) / omitting extra information 1 Get is generally more appropriate in informal spoken English. example of no change 1 adjourn the pr oceeding so the party can get representation example of change 1 get acquire or use an assumed identity further reading Cambridge Guide pp 328- 9 (get, got and gotten ) Working Words p 240 Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Langua ge February 2023 viii Classification of entries Many entries are classified in the 'extra information' section of the entry into broad groups, eg formal words and archaisms. This part of the guide gives an explanation of the classifications and examples. Archaisms Rule Avoid using archaisms. Prefer a modern alternative. Explanation Archaisms are old-fashioned words and expressions that are no longer used in ordinary speech and writing. Archaisms are often used to achieve a legalistic and formal style. However, they are not necessary and can always be readily replaced. Examples Archaism Try aforementioned recasting / omitting aforesaid recasting / omitting amongst among / between albeit recasting / omitting beforementioned the [item] mentioned in / omitting / recasting belowmentioned / belowlisted / belowquoted the [item] mentioned in / omitting / recasting forth out / recasting henceforth from now on / recasting (using eg on and after ) / omitting henceforward from now on / recasting (using eg on and after ) / omitting hereafter after [X] / from now on / recasting hereby then / by [X] / because of [X] / omitting / recasting (supplying any necessary details) herein in [X] / recasting hereinafter after [X] / recasting omitting before [X] recasting omitting hereof of [X] / recasting hereto to [X] / recasting heretofore before [X] / recasting / omitting hereunder under [X] / recasting (using, eg follows / below ) hereunto to [X] / recasting Classification of Entries Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 ix Archaism Try herewith attached / with [X] / here is / recasting hitherto before [X] / previously / recasting howsoever no matt er how / however / recasting in lieu of instead of / in place of / in substitution for pertaining to about / of / in relation to / on relict surviving spouse / spouse / domestic partner thence from that place / from there / from that source / recast ing / from that direction / for that reason / therefore thenceforth / thenceforward from that time on(wards) / since then / from then / omitting / recasting thereabout(s) recasting thereafter afterwards / after [X] / then / omitting thereat recasting ( using, eg at it / there ) thereby by [X] / by way of [X] / recasting therefor for [X] / recasting / omitting therefrom from [X] / recasting therein in [X] / recasting thereinto in [X] / recasting thereof of [X] / from / out of /recasting thereo n on / then / recasting thereout out of [X] / from [X] / recasting thereto / theretofore to [X] / recasting thereunder under [X] / recasting thereunto recasting thereupon recasting therewith with [X] / recasting touching [ as a preposition ] for / about / in relation to to wit omitting / recasting / for example / that is under the hand of signed by undermentioned the [item mentioned in section x] / omitting / recasting unto to / omitting / recasting verily omitting whatsoever of any kind / whatever / recasting whence from where / from which place / recasting whensoever when / whenever / omitting whereabout about that / about which / whereabouts / recasting whereat at which / recasting whereby under which / by which / according to which / Classification of Entries Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 x Archaism Try recasting wherefor(e) for that / for which / why / for what purpose / therefore / recasting wherefrom from that / from which / recasting wherein in which / where / recasting whereof of which / recasting whereon on which / where / on what / reca sting wheresoever wherever / recasting whereto to which / recasting wheretofor recasting whereunder recasting whereupon at / after which / and then / recasting wherewith with which / recasting whichsoever omitting / recasting / whichever whilst while / although / and / but / when whither to where / to which place / where / in which direction whosoever / whomsoever whoever / whomever / omitting withal in addition to / also / as well / nevertheless / with / omitting / recasting within / w ithin-named [ as an adjective ] omitting / enclosed / recasting Further reading Cambridge Style Guide p 57 Cutts pp 22, 77- 8 Fowler's English Usage pp Dictionary p 74 Legal 6 Commercialese Rule Avoid using commercialese. Prefer plain language. Explanation Commercialese is the complex style of writing often found in older business documents, particularly correspondence. It sounds stilted and old-fashioned because it often uses many words and Latin abbreviations. Replace it with polite, but plain language. Examples advise as per Classification of Entries Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 xi Further reading Cambridge Style Guide p 149 Fowler's English Usage p 163 Gowers' Working Words p 122 Compound prepositions Rule Use the simplest, appropriate preposition. Explanation A compound preposition is a preposition consisting of 1 or more elements, eg because of and in the event of. A simple preposition consists of only 1 element, eg about, above, after, as, at, between, by, for, from, in, into, of, off, on, over, since, than, to, under, up, with and without. Some compound prepositions have simpler alternatives (either a simple preposition or a shorter compou nd preposition) and can be readily replaced. Use of these compounds is rarely justified. Other compound prepositions are entirely satisfactory (eg because of) or have useful roles in some contexts. Because of their lack of precision, compound prepositions can be especially useful in drafting to describe a relationship between concepts in the widest terms. However, frequently compound prepositions are unnecessary and are only clumsy devices applied mechanically without thought. Before using a compound preposition, always consider whether a simpler preposition would do. Examples of compound prepositions that have ready alternatives as a consequence of as regards as to by means of by virtue of for the purpose/purposes of for the reason that for which (there is) in accordance with in addition to in association with in case of in conjunction with in connection with in excess of in favour of in order that/to in regard to in respect of in terms of in the absence of in the affirmative in the case of in the context of in the course of in the event that/of in the nature of Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Langua ge February 2023 xii Example of compound preposition to be used with care in relation to Further reading Fowler's English Usage p 167 Gowers' Plain Words pp 54-7 Dogmatic words Rule Avoid the unjustified use of dogmatic words. Explanation Legal writing suffers from two contradictory vices. On the one hand, lawyers overqualify, and sound timid and doubtful or even evasive (see Timid phrases). On the other hand, lawyers overuse dogmatic words such as clearly, obviously and undoubtedly. Used properly, dogmatic words are intensifiers. They reinforce the impact of other words by emphasising the writer's conviction about them. They are, however, often used unnecessarily or inappropriately. Dogmatic words should be reserved for cases where their use is necessary and beyond contention. For example, clearly should be reserved for what is truly clear. If a dogmatic word is used to prop up an argument (especially a weak one), the word becomes a weasel wor d (see Weasel words). Rather than supporting the argument, the would-be intensifier destroys its force by obvious exaggeration. Examples actually / actual certain / certainly clearly / clear manifest / manifestly mere / merely necessarily obviously Further reading Garner's Legal Style pp Avoid using doublets, triplets and longer synonym strings. Prefer the most specific suitable word. Explanation A doublet or triplet is a collection of 2 or 3 synonyms that express what can be said by 1 word. Doublets and triplets reflect the diverse sources of the English language and Classification of Entries Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 xiii the resulting availability of synonyms (and near synonyms), drawn from different sources, for many ideas. During the medieval period, lawyers used a mixture of Latin, French and English. So that the meaning would be understood by all, and to avoid ambiguity, lawyers often used pairs of words from different languages. Examples of these kind of doublets include rest and residue (English/French), lands and tenements (English/French) and will and testament (English/Latin). According to Garner, there are several reasons why doublets and triplets have become part of legal language: the language of the law originated in the more leisurely prose of past times English oral tradition led to the use of repetition to allow listeners time to understand the speaker's point unfamiliar words could be given meaning by using them with 1 or more synonyms lawyers seem to have a natural distrust of their ability to fully convey the intended meaning using just a single word, and so often use a number of synonyms in the hope of avoiding unintended meanings and potential misinterpretation. (A verbal scattergun instead of a rifle shot.) Doublets and triplets detract from precise, concise and specific meaning. In most cases, a single word from a doublet or triplet will be enough to express the meaning given by each word of the group. Occasionally, it may be necessary to use a doublet or triplet as a term of art, eg aid and abet. However, these occasions are rare. Examples Doublet or triplet Try all and every all / a / each / the / omitting all and singular all / each / the / omitting any and all all / any / each / 1 or more of / (2 or more of) / recasting as and from from / after / on and after / recasting (using eg 6 month s beginning on ) as and when when / if / recasting authorise and empower recasting (using may) / authorise / allow by and under under / recasting by and with recasting due and payable see entry for 'due' each and all each / all / a / an / the / recasting each and every each / every / a / an / the / all / recasting entirely and completely completely fair and equitable fair / equitable Classification of Entries Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 xiv Doublet or triplet Try final and conclusive final / recasting finish and complete finish / complete / recasting fit and proper appropriate / suitable / recasting fit and suitable appropriate / suitable / recasting fitting and proper appropriate / suitable / reca sting for and during while / during / for for and in connection with / for or in connection with in / in connection with / in relation to / about / for / to / of for and on behalf of / for or on behalf of for / on behalf of force and effect / force or effect recasting (using has effect / force ) from and after from / after / on and after / recasting (using eg 6 months beginning on ) full and complete complete / recasting full force and effect effect good and sufficient adequate / enough / sufficient / suitable / appropriate / satisfactory give, devise and bequeath give / give by will hear and decide hear / decide / deal with / no change hear and determine hear and decide / hear / decide / deal with if and when if / when / whenever / recasting in and / or in connection with about / for / in / of / over / to / with / in relation to / in connection with / recasting jointly and severally [also joint and several] recasting (using together / alone / individually / each of them ) just and reasonable just / fair / reasonable / impartial means and includes means no force or effect no effect null and void void / invalid / recasting (using of no (legal) effect ) pay, satisfy and discharge satisfy / discharge / comply with perform a nd discharge perform / discharge / recasting possession, custody and control possession / ownership power and / or authority power / omitting relieve and discharge discharge / recasting rest, residue and remainder all other property / all remaining pr operty / all the rest of the property / the balance of the property / all property left over / rest / balance / residuary estate (in a will) right, title and interest interest / recasting save and except except / other than / subject to / unless / recasting separate and apart separate / apart Classification of Entries Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 xv Doublet or triplet Try separate and distinct separate / distinct signed, sealed and delivered recasting sole and exclusive exclusive / only / recasting terms and conditions terms / conditions terms and provisions terms / provisio ns to and / or in relation to to / about / for / of / in relation to to and / or in respect of about / for / to / of / in relation to transfer and assign transfer / give / sell / recasting (using more precise words) true and correct correct / accurat e / true type and kind omitting / kind / type uncontroverted and uncontradicted not disputed / not denied / not opposed under and subject to under / recasting understood and agreed recasting (using agreed ) / omitting undertake and agree agree unless and until unless / when / if /until / recasting void and of no effect / void and unenforceable void / of no (legal) effect / has no (legal) effect / invalid when and as when / whenever / as / recasting Further reading Garner's Dictionary pp 292-5 Garner's Legal Style pp 187-8 Euphemisms Rule Avoid the unnecessary use of euphemisms. Use the most direct word if appropriate. Explanation The word euphemism comes from 2 Greek words meaning speaking nicely. A euphemism is a vague, indirect word or phrase used to say something unpleasant in a less direct or confronting way. Euphemisms are used in 3 ways: to disguise harsh or disagreeable facts (eg correctional facility for prison) to dress things up or add status to something ( hair consultant for hairdresser) as genteel substitutes for words considered to be indelicate (lavatory for toilet) Euphemisms are generally not appropriate for legislation because of their tendency to become dated. Examples ablution facilities decease / deceased Classification of Entries Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 xvi demise (for death) imbibe inebriated intoxicated permanent layoff predecease revenue enhancement Further reading Cambridge Style Guide pp 256- 7 Fowler's Howa rd's Longman English Usage 254 Partridge pp 108- 10 Right Words pp 143- 4 Working Words p 212 Foreign words and phrases Rule Avoid using foreign words. Write in English, not in Latin, Norman French or any other foreign language. Explanation Foreign words that have not been fully absorbed into English are obscure and irritating to readers who do not know the word or its meaning. They can be a sign of the writer's disregard for readers. Technical legal expressions in Latin or Norman French are especially objectionable (see Technical words ). Their obscurity can prevent non-lawyers from arriving at even a minimal understanding of the law. Foreign words are sometimes used as a substitute for proper reasoning and to cloak an unjustified assumption with figleaf respectability. Their misuse can lead to the embarrassment of the pretentious blunder. Foreign words usually have an English equivalent that can be readily substituted. If possible, use the English equivalent. Examples Foreign word Try ab initio see\u2014ab initio see\u2014inter alia / recasting force majeure see\u2014force majeure Classification of Entries Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Langu age February 2023 xvii Foreign word Try in camera or re omitting / about / regarding / on / concerning / recasting in rem against the thing / against the world at large / in the matter of / recasting in situ on site / on- the-spot / in [its] usual place / in [its] original place / undisturb ed in toto completely / as a whole / entirely / fully / totally / wholly / without exception / total / in all / recasting ipso facto by that very fact / recasting per annum a year / by the year / for each year / per year / annually per diem a day / by the day / for each day / per day / daily per procurationem / per proc. / per pro. / p.p for / on behalf of per se by itself / in itself / as such / essentially / for its own sake / standing alone / as a matter of law per stirpes recasting (adding a n explanation of the phrase) precis summary primus inter pares first among equals / having precedence but no greater authority pro forma as a matter of form / for the sake of form / as a gesture / recasting pro tanto in part / to that extent / as far as it goes / so much / recasting pro tem(pore) for the time being / temporarily / recasting (using interim arrangement / informal arrangement ) proximo mense or prox. recasting (using next month or the name of next month eg February ) qua as / in the ca pacity of / recasting (using eg as such ) quantum amount / share / portion rata see\u2014pro rata re omitting / about / regarding / on / concerning / recasting seriatim in a series / in turn / one after another / in sequence / successively / serially / one at a time / in the same order Classification of Entries Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 xviii Foreign word Try simpliciter taken alone / taken by itself / summarily / unconditionally / absolutely / on its own sine die indefinitely / without fixing a day sine qua non recasting (using essential / indispensable / necessary / necessi ty) sui generis unique / one of a kind sui juris of full legal capacity uberrima fidei of the utmost good faith / recasting (adding an explanation of the phrase) ultimo mense or ult. recasting (using last month or the name of the last month eg July) videlicet or viz namely / that is to say / recasting (using the following ) / omitting vires power / authority vis-\u00e0-vis face to face / opposite / in relation to / about / as regards / regarding / on / for / in / of / over / to / with / recasting (u sing more precise words) viva voce orally / spoken oral examination vivos see\u2014intervivos Further reading (Latinisms) Longman 9, 405 (Latinisms) Right words pp 160- 1 Legalese Rule Avoid using legalese. Prefer plain language. Explanation Legalese is the complicated, technical language and complex style of writing used in older legal documents. The reason for using legalese seems to be that it is believed to result in certainty. However, this is not always the case. Using legalese often makes documents incomprehensible\u2014not only to non-lawyers, but often to lawyers as well. Examples as appropriate as the case may be / as the cas e requires / as the case may require Classification of Entries Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Langu age February 2023 xix but for call in question derogate except as otherwise provided pursuant to semble several show cause subject of time is of the essence unless the contrary intention appears wherever occurring without limiting t he generality of Further reading Cutts pp 140- 7 (lucid legal language) Fowler's English Usage Dictionary p Words pp 6-7, 71-4 Howard's Guide p 242 (legal English) Padding Rule Do not use throat-clearing phrases, flotsam phrases or other padding. Write simply and directly. Explanation Padding is using woolly words, phrases and even sentences that contribute nothing to the reader's understanding of the writer's meaning. Much padding is the oral equivalent of throat-clearing\u2014an opening flourish before the writer gets down to saying what he or she wants to say. Other padding consists of the standard flotsam phrases (eg the fact that) that float idly in a sentence without carrying any meaning. Often using padding comes partly from an exaggerated feeling that wordiness is an ingredient of politeness, and that a blunt statement is crude, if not rude. Padding can usually be left out or replaced by simpler words. Eliminating padding helps develop a si mpler, more direct writing style. Examples in terms of on a ... basis (see basis ) the fact that Further reading Garner's Legal Style pp 55-7 Gowers' Plain words pp 65-9 Technical words Rule Avoid using technical words. Explain any technical words that are necessary. Classification of Entries Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Langua ge February 2023 xx Explanation Legal and other technical words are obscure and irritating to readers who do not know the words or their meaning. They can be a sign of the writer's disregard for the reader. Technical legal expressions in Latin or Norman French are especially objectionable (see Foreign words and phrases). Some legal expressions have no special legal meaning. They are either pomposities that have a non-technical, English equivalent, or expressions of imprecise meaning whose use merely provides a delusion of certainty. Before using a legal expression, decide whether it is either of these kinds. Substitution of a non-technical equivalent for a legal or other expression may not, of itself, provide an appropriate solution. Your readers may be misled into believing that they understand the non-technical equivalent. If a technical expression is necessary, consider providing a brief, plain English explanation of its meaning using a textual note, footnote or explanatory provision.

Explanation A vogue w ord or phrase is a word or phrase that goes in and out of fashion; that has a relatively short life. Garner (in Garner's Legal Style, at p 32) states: Whenever you write a word or phrase that is on the tip of everyone's tongue, strike it out. Vogue words cheapen prose, partly because their fashionableness wears down their meaning to the blandest generality, and partly because they make you sound like an unthinking writer of ready-made phrases.

Explanation Webster's Third New International Dictionary (Vol. III, p 2590) defines 'weasel word' in the following way: weasel word n [ weasel = word; fr. the weasel's reputed habit of sucking the contents out of an egg [while] leaving the shell superficially intact]: a word that destroys the force of a statement by equivocal qualification ... : a word used in order to evade or retreat from a direct or forthright statement or position weasel words are the adman's way of crossing his fingers behind his back when he makes a somewhat elastic statement - Robert Littell. Classification of Entries Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Langua ge February 2023 xxii The Reader's Digest Reverse Dictionary (pp 764-765) defines 'weasel words' as ... unreliable words or expressions, as in We will use our best endeavours, suggesting yet evading a promise or commitment [referring to eggs that when sucked dry by weasels keep their shape but are drained of their content]. Lawyers are notorious for qualifying every statement they make with weasel words. Weasel words are also dealt with under Dogmatic words and Timid phrases.

Less relates to degree, quantity or extent. 2 A good rule of thumb is to use fewer with plural nouns (eg fewer people, worries etc) and less with singular nouns (eg less land, boredom etc). The same rule of thumb applies to fewer than and less than. 3 Measurements (eg money, time, distance and weight), although expressed in the plural, are thought of as single units and require less than (eg to pay less than $100 and weigh less than 30g). 4 Alternatively, less applies to mass nouns (ie nouns almost always used in the singular because they refer to concepts, substances or quantities with no clear- cut boundaries, eg salt, butter, honesty and education) and fewer applies to count nouns (ie nouns that refer to things that can be counted and so can be pluralised, eg cars, books, people and offices). 5 However, less is gradually replacing fewer in most contexts and the issue of using fewer rather than less is now more a matter of style than grammar. Using fewer is more formal than using less . 6 Note that it is necessary to write a smaller number or fewer rather than a fewer number . Garner (Garner's Redbook) states that it is redundant to say a fewer number because th e sense of a number is included in the meaning of fewer . 7 See also not fewer than. examples of no change 1 the premises have fewer than 12 rooms 2 A container must be fixed to the floor with no fewer than 2 anchor bolts. example of change 1 The appointment must be for the term stated in the appointment, which must be no fewer less than 7 years. further reading Cambri dge Guide pp 292- 3 (fewer or less) Garner's Legal Style pp 123 -4 Gowers' Plain Words p 241 Howard's Handbook 167 ( fewer /less) Working Words pp 223 -4 field usage \u2014consider alternatives try\u2014recasting (using more precise words) / omitting extra information 1 Avoid using field as an omnibus word.

An exception is towards which is used as a preposition. 2 In Australian (and British) English, the adverb form of these directional words has traditionally ended with an 's', and the adjective and noun forms have not. In American English adjectives, nouns and adverbs are treated in the same way and do not usually end in an 's'. There is an increasing trend in Australian English not to end adverb forms with an 's'. The trend is more advanced with some directional words than others. 3 The trend is perhaps most advanced in relation to forward(s) . There have been various attempts to rationalise the cases in which forwards should nevertheless continue to be used as an adverb, eg for moving straight ahead (Longman English Usage), for a physical movement, or for movement towards a place (Working Words). However, the rationalisations are not persuasive. 4 It is now too late to say that the adverb form of forward(s) always ends with an 's'. However, as an adverb, prefer forwards if appropriate. 5 Use forward as an adjective. 6 See also afterward / afterwards ; backward / backwards ; easterly (direction) / eastwardly /eastward(s) ; onward / onwards ; toward / towards. examples of no change 1 the driver's forward view (ad jective) 2 if the company carries the losses forward to the next year (adverb) example of change 1 must be able to be driven both backwards and forward forwards (adverb) further reading Fowler's English Usage Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 F-14 Howard's Handbook p 175 Longman English Usage a usage \u2014avoid using try\u2014send / give extra informatio n 1 Except t o mean send on, prefer send or give . example of no change 1 For this Act, sell means send, forward or deliver for sale. example of change 1 forward give a copy of the claim to the fund manager further reading Gowers' Plain W ords p 230 Howard's Guide p 174 Howard's Handbook p 175 Longman English Usage p 294 for which there is usage \u2014avoid using try\u2014with / recasting extra information 1 compound preposition examples of no change 1 uninsured motor vehicle means a motor vehicle for which there is no CTP policy in force 2 A document for use in relation to a proceeding, and for which there is an approved form, example of change 1 participating jurisdiction means a State for which there is that has in force an Act of its Parliament that refers to the Parliament of the Commonwealth . frame [as a verb ] usage \u2014never use try\u2014 develop / make / prepare extra information 1 vogue, vague word examples of change 1 frame develop a budget 2 a shareholder may frame prepare a question F Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Langua ge February 2023 F-15 frequently usage \u2014consider alternatives try\u2014often / regularly extra information 1 Prefer often if appropriate. example of no change 1 If the court is satisfied that a person has frequently commenced vexatious proceedings, the court may declare the person to be a vexatious litigant. exam ple of change 1 provision for the financial statements of the cooperative to be audited annually or more frequently often fresh usage \u2014consider alternatives try\u2014new / recasting (using again) extra information 1 overused word examples of no change 1 the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person 2 the fresh or dried parts of a cannabis plant examples of change 1 the availability of fresh new evidence or information relevant to the granting of bail 2 t he p lanning and land authority may invite fresh applications for the lease to be made again further reading Gowers' Plain Words p 230 Howard's Handbook p /renewed ) alternatives try\u2014 on and after / afte r / recasting (using eg 6 months beginning on / inclusive ) extra information 1 Be careful using from .

Give is the more general and less formal word. Grant has certain technical meanings in real pr operty law, eg a grant of freehold title. In other contexts, grant implies that a person gives something out of generosity, mercy or a sense of justice. It points strongly to the giver's discretion to do as the giver pleases, and the would- be receiver as depending on that discretion. Applied to the giving of licences and other forms of permission, it has overtones inconsistent with modern administrative law concepts. 3 See Drafting Practice Guide, ch 14, 'grant / issue'. examples of no change 1 if a lease i s surrendered for renewal and a new lease is granted 2 The Magistrates Court may grant an injunction restraining a person from contravening this Act. examples of change 1 The authority may grant issue a licence. 2 The authority may grant agree to the requ est. further reading Fowler's English Usage p 341 ( than usag e\u2014consider alternatives try\u2014 more than / heavier than / larger than / longer than / older than / taller than / higher than / over / recasting (using, eg at least / or more ) extra information 1 Prefer more than when using numbers to count something or me asurements, unless a more specific term is appropriate, for example 'higher than 7m'. 2 Conside r whether it is more accurate to use at least. 3 See also not greater than. example of no change 1 the latest CPI number is greater than the earlier CPI number examples of change 1 a motor vehicle with a gross vehicle mass greater heavier than 4.5t 2 if the wall is greater than higher than 4m 3 the runway must be greater longer than 500m in length 4 if a factor worked out under subsection (4) is greater more than 4 G Words and P hrases: A Guide to Plain Legal La nguage February 2023 G-5 greatest see\u2014the greatest number of ground see\u2014on the ground / grounds of / that group usage \u2014consider alternatives try\u2014 kind / omitting extra information 1 Most legal drafting is expressed in the singular, and it is usually unnecessary to distinguish between a class (using, eg group) and its members (see LA, s 48 and s 145 (b)).

Delusion suggests that the misa pprehension is subjective and results from distorted thinking or a disordered mind.

See also LA, dict, pt 1, def by regulation. 3 Prescr ibe should continue to be used, as appropriate, in provisions giving power to make statutory instruments. In other contexts, pr efer set or fix . 4 As prescribe is not a well understood concept, in provisions giving power to make statutory instruments prefer an alternative phrase (eg declared by regulation) or recasting. If it is necessary to use prescribed , prefer pre scribed by regulation (or another kind of legislative instrument) rather than just prescribed . 5 Avoid using prescribe in the sense of prescrib ed by the Act (or provision of the Act). 6 If an authorising provision states that something may be prescribed in a statutory instrument, in prescribing the thing, it is usually unnecessary to use the word prescribe . In prescribing things in a statutory instrument, avoid using prescribe , especially in provision headings. 7 Prescribe and proscribe are sometimes confus ed. To prescri be is to lay down rules to be followed. To proscribe is to condemn or prohibit something (see proscribe ). example of no change 1 A person may apply for a benefit in the way prescribed by regulation. examples of change 1 The education board pr escribed set the syllabus for subject. 2 Section X of an Act states: 'The fee for a licence is as prescribed by regulation.'.

When used to mean 'to suppose', the words are interchangeable. Otherwise, the choice of word depends on usage and the degree of tentativeness behind the presumption or assumption. 2 In Australian English, assume is more common than presume . Presume is, however, invariably used in certain legal contexts, eg the presumption of innocence and evidentiary presumptions. 3 Outside these legal contexts, a presumption expre sses what the writer really believes. By contrast, an assumption can be made for the sake of argument and without implying belief in its truth. 4 Because of it depersonalised nature, assume slips readily into a discussion and draws less attention to itself and more to t he particular point the writer wants to highlight. Presume , by contrast, seems to draw attention to itself and to the presumptive act by the writer. It has the faint suggestion of presumptuousness. further reading Cambridge Guide pp 62- 3 (assume or presume ) Fowler's English Usage 74 ( assume , presume ; ), ( presumption) Working Words p 50 presumptive usage \u2014consider alternatives try\u2014presumptuous extra information 1 formal word 2 Presumptive and presumptuous are sometimes confused.

Cancel originally pointed specifically to the crossing out of something, eg cancelling an en try by drawing a line through it. It is also particularly apt to deal with the physical marking or alteration of something to render it invalid for further use, eg cancelling a postage stamp by overmarking it, cancelling a cheque by writing cancelled acros s it or cancelling a bus ticket by perforating it. It is, therefore, the appropriate word to use for bringing instruments to an end in a way that involves (or usually involves) physical marking or alteration, eg cancelling a licence. For bringing instr umen ts to an end in other ways or for bringing rights not necessarily embodied in an instrument to an end, prefer revoke if appropriate, eg revoke an appointment, approval, decision, decree, exemption, permission, promise or right of access. 3 See LA, dict , pt 1, def repeal . example of no change 1 The appointer may amend a delegation or revoke it completely or partly. example of change 1 The power to make an appointment includes the power to revoke end the appointment. further reading Garner's D ictionary p 771 (revoke; retract ) Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 S-1 S sanction [as a verb ] usage \u2014avoid using try\u2014approve / permit / allow / authorise / recasting (using may) / impose a penalty / penalise / confirm extra information 1 formal word that can be ambiguous example of chang e 1 The Mini ster must sanction approve the transfer. further reading Fowler's English Usage p 688 Garner's Dictionary p 780 Garner's Legal Style p 139 Working Words p 482 satisfy usage \u2014consider alternatives try\u2014comply with / complete / fill in / carry on / out / perform / fulfil / answer / meet / make certain extra information 1 vague word 2 See Drafting Practice Guide, ch 14, 'satisfied and believes'. example of no change 1 if the Minister is satisfied examples of change 1 The notice may state how it must be satisfi ed complied with . 2 An applicant must satisfy meet the requirements of the section.

State should be used for the initial declaration of somethin g. To avoid the problem of elegant variation, prefer state for this purpose to alternatives such as specify or stipulate if appropriate. In less formal contexts, however, prefer a simpler alternative, eg tell. 2 Mention should be used for c ross-references, eg 'a person mentioned in section X'. The use of mention for cross -referencing purposes is supported by the comments of Dixon CJ in Tooheys Limited v Commissioner for Stamp Duties (1960) 105 CLR 602 at 612. 3 Use set out if a document, map, diagram or oth er item is being incorporated into, and reproduced in, an instrument, eg 'the map set out in the schedule', or simply say 'the map in the schedule'.

T Words and Phrases: A G uide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 T-4 4 That is frequently overused in drafting. This can m ake writing seem formal and even stilted. Used more sparingly, that helps to make writing more lively and more in line with everyday speech. Generally, use that only if it is grammatically or stylistically neces sary, or necessary to avoid ambiguity (including momentary ambiguity). 5 It is difficult to lay down precise rules for when that is stylistically necessary. However, that is more likely to be necessary as a conjunction after the following verbs: answer , agree, announce , argue , request , state , suggest . On the other hand, that is unusual with the following verbs: ask , believe, presume , suppose , think . The use of that is optional with the following verbs: be t old, confess , cons ider, declare, grant , hear , know , perceive, propose , say, see, understand. Generally, do not use that if its use is stylistically optional (or unusual). If a less formal writing style is used, that is less likely to be stylistically nece ssary even with verbs usually accompanied by that in more formal writing. If in doubt, leave that out. 6 The use of that as a conjunction can lead to unduly long or complex sentences and structural mistakes. 7 Do not use that if since, if or so would be appropriate. 8 For t he use of who and that , see who. 9 For the use of which and that, see which . 10 See also the fact that . examples of no change 1 The authorised officer must warn the person that it is an offence to fail to state the person's name. 2 in a way that preserves its confidentiality 3 The court must assume that the exercise of power 4 The application [to set aside a bankruptcy notice] must be accompanied by a copy of any application to set aside the judgment for which the bankruptcy notice was issued and any materi al in support of that application. examples of change 1 in detail that is sufficient in sufficient detail 2 at the times and places that the chairperson determines decided by the chairperson 3 the date and time that when the magistrate signed 4 is satisfie d that it is necessary 5 a State that corresponds corresponding 6 proposed performance targets for that the year 7 If there are any conditions that do not comply with this section, 8 any salary that is paid 9 a voyage that begins or ends beginning or ending in Australian waters 10 on a day that is not other than a Saturday or Sunday further reading Cambridge Guide pp 746-7 Fowler's English Usage (2nd ed) pp 622- 30 (tentative list of verbs that p refer that expressed/omitted/used or not according to context on p 624) T Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Lang uage February 2023 suppressed unnecessarily repeated) Gowers' Plain Words pp 121- 4, 189- 90 Longman English Grammar p 14 (useful discussion on the use of th at) Partridge p 348 Working Words pp 517-8 the course of see\u2014during the course of ; in the course of the effect that see\u2014to the effect that the equivalent to see\u2014equivalent the expression [in definitional sense ] usage \u2014never use try\u2014omitting extra informa tion 1 redundancy 2 formal phrase example of change 1 A reference to the expression relevant law is a reference to the law of the State where the person lives. relevant law means the law of the State where the person lives. the fact that usage \u2014consider alternatives try\u2014omitting / recasting (using eg because / although / that) extra information 1 The expression the fact that can be useful and appropriate, but it is sometimes a clumsy way of sa ying what might be said more simply.

Although it is now often used more loosely, unique should be reserved for things that are one of a kind.

However, whether is ge nerally preferable to express an alternative or possibility rather than a conditional idea.

In using if , take care to avoid ambiguity (see example 1, examples of no change). W Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Lang uage February 2023 W-5 2 In the phras e whether or not the words or not are usually superfluous, since whether implies or not .

With a defining clause, either which or that is grammatically permissible. 2 Gowers' Plain Words (p 158) explains defining and commenting clauses in this way: If you say, 'The man who was here this morning told me that', the relative clause is a defining one, it completes the subject 'the man', which conveys no definite meaning without it. But if you say, 'Jones, who was here this morning, told me that', the relative clause is commenting; the subject 'Jones' is already complete and the relative cl ause only adds a bit of information about him which may or may not be important but is not essential to the definition of the subject. 3 A useful test for distinguishing between commenting and defining clauses is given by Garner (Legal Style p 141). If put ting the clause in brackets leaves the basic meaning of the sentence intact, the clause is a commenting clause (properly introduced by which ). If the sentence is rendered nonsensical or its meaning is changed, the clause is a defining clause (properly introduced by that). W Words and Phrases: A G uide to Plain Legal Language February 2023 W-6 4 Commenting clauses should be used infrequently in legislative drafting. 5 Although that as a relative pronoun may not be preceded by a preposition, it is permissible for which to be preceded by a preposition. 6 Do not use which to refer to people, other than people in a body (see that ). 7 Do not use which without a proper antecedent. Which should only be used to refer to a specific antecedent, and not to a general idea or whole statement. 8 For the use of whose instead of of which for ina nimate objects, se e whose . 9 If which is needed as the subject of a subclause, try res tructuring as a new provision. 10 See also and (and which/ or which) ; during which; for which (there is) ; in which; on which; to which this [provision] applies . examples o f no change 1 the salary or wage to which the officer is entitled 2 the claim relates to abuse to which the person was subjected 3 a program by which stated objectives are to be achieved 4 The consequences of entering into the agreement are stated in secti on Y, which has ef fect despite anything in the agreement.

However, that can also be used to refer to people or words that might be thought of as people-substitutes, eg anyone, everyone and someone (although who comes more n aturally in most cases). 2 Either who or that may be used to refer to groups of people described using a collective noun (eg a committee), but that should be preferred. 3 Use that to refer to both humans and animals or humans and things. 4 The traditional distinction betwee n who and whom is that who acts as the subject of a verb (eg 'the person who is talking') and whom as the object of a verb or preposition (eg 'the person of whom we spoke'). However, whom is increasingly rarely used (except after preposit ions) and often sounds unnatural and even exces sively pedantic. If possible, avoid both infringing the traditional distinction and the use of whom by using that , omitting whom , or otherwise recasting. 5 See also and (and who) ; as to whether /who/ what / how /etc. W Words and Phrases: A Guide to Plain Legal Lang uage February 2023 W-9 examples of ch ange 1 The corporation who that made the decision no longer exists. 2 a person who this section applies to to whom this section applies further reading Cambridge Guide pp 809- 10 (whom ) Fowler's English Garne 145 whom ), 202 (to avoid sexist language) Gowers' Plain English pp 122, 189 -90 (who or that ) 124 -5 (who or whom (who/whom ) whose usage \u2014consi der alternatives try\u2014recasting / of which extra information 1 Although whose is increasingly being used to refer to animals and things as well as people, it should not generally be used in this way in formal writing. 2 Prefer recasting if practicable.
