Sending documents to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad Following your interview, if you need to send us any documents, please DO NOT mail them to us directly. Instead, follow the instructions the consular officer gives you during your interview. Rescheduling or cancelling your interview If you are unable to attend your appointment, please notify us through our online go to [US Travel docs](http://www.ustraveldocs.com/pk/index.html?firstTime=No) to select a new appointment date [.](https://pk.usembassy.gov/visas/immigrant-visa-inquiries/) There may be a significant wait before the next available appointment, so please attempt to attend the date already assigned.

All fees may be paid in either U.S. dollars or the Pakistani Rupee equivalent. We accept cash and credit cards only. Please note that if you are found ineligible to receive a visa, the application fee cannot be refunded. A complete list of fees can be found on our [Fees for Visa Services webpage](/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/fees-visa-services.html). Do not make travel plans outside of Pakistan prior to visa issuance If your visa is approved, we will keep your passport at the embassy while we prepare your immigration packet and print a visa for your passport. We will return your passport to you later via courier services only. If you have to travel within Pakistan while your passport is still with us, please make sure you have a valid picture ID other than your passport. A consular officer can make a decision on a visa application only after reviewing the formal application and interviewing the applicant. There is no guarantee that you will receive a visa. Do not sell your house, car or property, resign from your job or make non-refundable flight or other travel arrangements until you have received your immigrant visa. If more information is needed Sometimes a consular officer is unable to make a decision on a visa application because he/she needs to review additional documents or the case requires further administrative processing. When additional documents are requested, the consular officer will give you a refusal letter that asks you to submit additional documents. The letter will include instructions on how to send those documents to the embassy. Administrative processing takes additional time after the interview. Most administrative processing is resolved within 60 days. However, the timing varies based on the circumstances of each case. Before inquiring about the status of administrative processing, please wait at least 60 days after your interview. What happens after visa approval? Passport, Visa, and Sealed Immigrant Packet - We will place your immigrant visa on a page in your passport. Please review your visa to make sure there are no spelling errors. We will also give you a sealed envelope containing documents that you must give it to the U.S. immigration authorities when you arrive at the port of entry in the United States for the first time. Do not open this envelope. You must carry it with you; do not put it in your checked luggage. If you receive X-rays during your medical examination, carry those with you and give them to the U.S. immigration authorities. USCIS Immigrant Fee - All individuals who are issued immigrant visas overseas must pay an [Immigrant Fee](https://www.uscis.gov/file-online/uscis-immigrant-fee) to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) prior to traveling to the United States. This fee is for processing your residency status and printing your Permanent Resident Card. The only people exempt from paying this fee are: children entering the United States under the Hague Process, returning residents, and people traveling on a fianc\u00e9(e) (K) visa. When You Should Travel - You must enter the United States before the expiration date on your issued visa. Your visa cannot be extended and all fees are nonrefundable. The principal applicant must enter before or at the same time as all accompanying family members with visas. Unless they are eligible for benefits under the Child Status Protection Act, children who are issued a visa before turning 21 years of age must enter the United States before their 21st birthday to avoid losing their immigrant status. USCIS Immigrant Fee - All individuals who are issued immigrant visas overseas must pay an [Immigrant Fee](https://uscis.gov/file-online/uscis-immigrant-fee) to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) prior to traveling to the United States. This fee is for processing your residency status and printing your Permanent Resident Card. The only people exempt from paying this fee are: children entering the United States under the Hague Process, returning residents, and people traveling on a fianc\u00e9(fianc\u00e9 (e) (K) visa. Getting a Green Card - Your Form I-551 Permanent Resident Card, also known as a green card, will be automatically mailed to the address in the United States that you write in your visa application form. This is a very important document that proves you have permission to reside in the United States. If you plan to travel outside the U.S. before your green card arrives: Please consult [USCIS's](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/temporary-i-551-stamps-and-mrivs) and [CBP's](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/your-trip) websites for rules about what documents you need to re-enter the country. We also recommend you check with the airline to ensure you are in compliance with their rules. Once your card is issued, you should not stay outside of the United States for more than one year. If you do, you may lose your status as a Lawful Permanent Resident. Children's Issues - Children are required to have certain vaccinations before they can enroll in school in the United States. Therefore, we recommend that you bring your child's complete vaccination records with you to the United States. Additionally, if your child is adopted, you have full custody as a result of a divorce, or you share custody with the child's other parent, we recommend that you bring a copy of all applicable adoption or custodial papers from the authoritative court in your home country. You will likely need these papers (translated into English) in the United States for issues such as school enrollment, medical care, and eventual citizenship.
