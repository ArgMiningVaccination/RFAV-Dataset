The research [is published](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00308-0/fulltext) in EBioMedicine. German scientists tested immune response and ipsilateral versus contralateral vaccination by looking at data from 303 people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID mRNA vaccine. None participants had not contracted COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Antibody levels were measured 2 weeks after the second dose in 147 participants who received the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine in the same arm as the first, and 156 who got the second shot in the opposite arm. A subgroup of 143 individuals (64 ipsilateral, 79 contralateral) was analyzed for spike-specific CD4 and CD8 using flow cytometry, the authors said. Median spike-specific immunoglobulin levels did not differ between the two groups, but neutralizing activity was significantly lower after contralateral vaccination. The number of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, known as killer T cells, were detected in 67% of same-arm participants, compared to just 43% of the contralaterally vaccinated subjects. Our study indicates that ipsilateral vaccinations generate a stronger immune response than contralateral vaccinations. \"Our study indicates that ipsilateral vaccinations generate a stronger immune response than contralateral vaccinations,\" said researcher Laura Ziegler in a Saarland University [press release](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/998474). More research needs to be done to confirm these findings, the authors said, but they suggest the effect might be due booster vaccination drainage by the same lymph nodes used "}
