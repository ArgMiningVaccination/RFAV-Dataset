These findings are a critical supp lement to the Waukesha County Community Health Survey conducted through a partners hip between Ascension Wisconsin, Aurora Health Care, Children's Wisconsi n, Froedtert Health, ProHealth Care, and the Waukesha County Public Health Division . The Community Health Needs Assessment incorporates input from persons representing the broad interests of the community served, and from those who possess special knowledge of or expertise in public health. Key informants in Waukesha County were identified by Ascension Wis consin, Aurora Health Care, Children's Wisconsin, Froedtert Health, and ProHealth Care in partnership with the Waukesha County Public Health Division . The se organizations also invited the informants to participate and conducted the interviews from June to September 2020. The interviewers used a standard interview script that included the following elements: Ranking of up to five public health issues, based on the focus areas presented in Wisconsin's State Health Plan, that are the most important issues for the County; For those five public health issues: o Existing strategies to address the issue o Barriers and challenges to addressing the issue o Additional stra tegies needed o Key groups in the community that hospitals should partner with to improve community hea lth o Identification of subgroups or subpopulations where efforts could be targeted o Ways efforts can be targeted toward each subgroup or subpopulation ; and To be responsive to the current conditions during the COVID -19 pandemic, the following additional ques tions were added to the interview guide: o What community needs or gaps have developed since the coronavirus pandemic began? o How can health care organizations support the community during this pandemic? o What methods of communication and outreach have been su ccessful to reach partners and community members during the pandemic? o How would you suggest health care organizations outreach to community partners and members to implement health initiatives ? 2 All informants were made aware that participation was voluntary and that responses would be shared with the Center for Urban Popula tion Health for analysis and reporting. Based on the summaries provided to the Center for Urban Population Health, this report presents the results of the 2020 key informant interviews f or Waukesha County. The report first presents a summary of the health issue rankings, including a list of the five issues which were ranked most frequently by respondents. The next section describes the themes that presented themselves across the top rank ed health topics. Finally, summaries of the strategies, barriers, par tners, and potential targeted subpopulations described by participants are provided as well. Limitations : Forty -one key informant interviews were conducted with 47 respondents in Waukesh a County . Some interviews incorporated the views of more than one person from an organization. This report relies on the opinions and experiences of a limited number of experts identified as having the community's pulse. However, responses may not be representative of the overall perception of community strengths and needs. It is possible that the results would have been substantially different if a different set of informants had been interviewed. Results should be interpreted with caution and in conjuncti on with o ther Waukesha County data (e.g., community health survey and secondary data). A. COVID -19 Community needs or gaps that have developed since the coronavirus pandemic: The key themes that emer ged from the res ponses have to do with gaps in informat ion about what t o do , lack of access to needed care and services during the pandemic, problems with te chnology and telehealth services, isolati on, loneliness , and related cop ing methods , gaps in test ing, lack of PPE and other supplies, families not havin g their basic needs met, issues related to employment and job loss , and lack of space. Information about what to do: Key informant s indicated they need information about COVID -19, information about job support, guidance for what precautions to take, info rmation about testing, factual information from trus ted sources , and guidance abou t what the most important messages are to get out to the community , as well as the problems genera ted by the s pread of misinformation and lack of consensus on messages coming from government agencies. This resulted in a loss of trust in public health and government communications that has become a large challenge. Lack of access to care and services : When everything had first shut down, there was a gap in services before organizations could figure out a process for getting back to providing support and services , some organizations have had to limit the number of patients seen, haven 't been able to have volun teers working, have started te lehealth appointments , and moved to curbside operations. Several key informants mentioned gaps and losses in mental health s upports / support groups , coun seling, and access to care that is necessa ry at this time. People with chronic conditions have not been tracked and moni tored as closely as they normal ly would have because that wasn 't a priority. People have been waiting un til things become a crisis to seek care . There are inconsistencies with appointments and rescheduling. Seniors in particular may be experienc ing a lack of access to care due to trou ble with 3 virtual appointments and fear or anxiety about in -person appointments . The pandemic has exacerbated issues that already existed accessing care for people who are un - or un der-insured or have low income. Technology and tele health : Though i t has been important to try to return to care virtually for safety reasons, it isn 't accessible to everyone. Patients don 't have the training or necessary technology to participate in these appointments and some have lost access to car e or are waiting for face -to-face services to resu me. Lack of access to broad band or the devices needed made it difficult for some students to con nect to school and for schools to support students with other health and mental health needs to the level they would have at school in person. For people who are unhoused and do not have steady access to electricity or a variety of devices, it is not access ible. Isolation and loneliness : In addition to the isolation and loneliness people may be feeling from staying home and having fewer daily interactions, key informants noted this is leading to depression, a nxiety, other mental health concern s, su bstance use, and in some cases, more stress on family relationships that can lead to violence and abu se. Key info rmants suggest ed caregive rs are feeling unsup ported at this time and it is hard for families who have a loved one in a ssisted living or skilled nu rsing facilities that they are not able to visit. Gaps in te sting : It was very difficult to get tested for COVID at f irst, there is a lack of information about testing, there are still some issues with availability, it can take some time to get results back, which can make operations difficult in certain contexts, such as homeless shel ters where it can be difficult to figure out who to isolate/quarantine . One key informant mentioned that F roedtert had done a good job of ensuring first res ponders had a ccess to testing. Lack of PPE : A couple key i nformants indicated they did not have enough PPE at some point since the pandemic began. Families not having basic needs met : Several key informants mentioned there is an increase in people and families experiencing food insecurity , transportation difficulties, lack of money for gas , and needing more economic supports in general. There have been a reduction in food pantry donations, volunteers can't work with the public when they are concerned about t he pandemic, and it is harder to meet needs for specific food ite ms (e.g. for people with allergies or on specific diets related to chronic disease). FoodShare can help families get food, but not other necessities like paper products , shampoo, etc. Issues related t o employment : A lot of people have lost jobs, had hours reduced , had furloughs, or had to take other jobs that pay less or do not provide the level of pro tection from the pandemic that some jobs have. For caregive rs who als o continue to be employed, there is a gap in childcare while children cannot go to schools or childcare providers. For families who have ne wly had job loss or reductions of income , there is a gap in knowledge about h ow to access support services and resources available to them . People have lost their health in surance coverage that is tied to employment, and don 't know where to turn for care. Businesses are also exp eriencing some gaps in information about what protocols they should be putting in place for safety. 4 Lack of space : Three key informants named lack of space as a n issue during the pan demic, particularly for sheltering pe ople experiencing homelessness, but also for social services programming to continue when operations have to be in person , but there isn 't enough room to safely p hysically distance. Other : Some of the gaps ke y informants mentioned did not fit in with these themes, s uch as the politics at the state and national levels have made conditions more difficult, people are on edge dealing with social issues, the pandemic has created conditions where they are seeing elder fi nancial abuse, long- term care is lacking super vision on a state level and visitation, and care coordination for vulnerable populations is an emerging need that is putting more pressure on free clinics . Ways healt h care organizations can support the community during this pandemic: Key informant s' responses discussed how health care organizations can be a hub for re sources, trusted information , and messaging about the pandemic, they can share equi pment and supplies, continue offering telehealth services, increase access to care and take on new patients, collaborate with other sectors, and work on testing . One suggestion that is cross -cutting across all these ideas is focusing on racial equity. Shar ing trusted i nformation and messaging: Key informants suggested health care organizations are trusted in the community and people look to them for information . As such, it could be helpful for them to serve as a hub for resources and access, have one number to call to get an swer s, share knowledge about what i s available, sharing messaging and education about the pandemic as well as wellness checks and immunizations i n general, help people understand testing and where they can go to get it, provide vetted information and facts from reliable sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), work with schools on guidelines to follow and mitigation strategies when students don 't follow through with guidelines, promote resources available at free clinics, bring more solutions to the public , and communicate about what exists. There were a few key info rman ts who empha sized the need for health care organizations to mitigate the misinformation that is being spread about COVID and be the experts giving instructions, provid ing experti se, collaborat ing with public health to be on the same page in te rms of messages and data and not work in silos , encouragi ng best practices in the community, and advis ing businesses and employers on what to do to keep their employees and customers safe . Consistent messaging is important, so when there are n ew recommendations based on emerging data, communicate about it transparently to patients and the public. Share equipment and supplies : Key informants suggested they might need help getting PPE and cleaning supplies for their organizations and if larger health care org anizations can help financially, or with donations or assistance o btaining supplies , or sharing spaces that aren 't being used with community organizations, that can be very helpful in keeping smaller organizations operation al. Telehealth services : Health care organizations can help by using telehealth visits and assisting with access to these services . Increasing access to health services : It would be helpful for health care org anizations to increase access to care , especially for families w ho have lost services since the pandemic b egan, continue to provide access to preventive care, offer services at co mmunity -based facilities, and provide nurses to help in the 5 commun ity. The most frequent ly requested service is helping people access mental health and substance abuse services during this time when needs are high, and people already had trou ble accessing th is kind of care prior to the pandemic. There might be a particular need for behavioral health access among children. Collaboration : Some key informants shared that it is important for health care organ izatio ns to collaborate with other organ izations in the community , specifically on sharing data about the pandemic with public health , finding ways to increase services to vulnerable populations, meeting with other organization s to improve community partnerships and connection s, work ing on community issues, and being a consistent presence to follow through on plans, and partner ing with school districts ' leadership to benefit the health of the community. Testing : Key informants believe there is a great need for community COVID testing , especially for low income residents , seniors, and in more rural areas . The county needs more consisten cy in how testing is done, drive through testing sites , testing at pla ces like food pantries, and s chools need faster access to COVID test results. Methods of communication and outreach that have been successful to reach partners and community members during the pandemic: Key i nformants reported communica ting electronically through email, social media, texting, and messaging apps, telehealth platforms, phone calls and voice messages, wor d of mouth and face -to-face in teractions, more traditional communications like mailings, flyers, newsletters, and traditional mass media such as TV and newspapers . Most reported using a variety of these methods . Across all of these type s of communication , they mentioned the importa nce of timely and accura te messages. Electronic and web -based communications : Key informants reported communicating with their patients , client s, and community members through Facebook Messenger, their own Facebook page, other so cial media, emails, texting, online newsletters, virtual conferences, advertising on phones (ads in games on phones) , posting resources on their websites, standing meetings on Zoom, we b-based calling, Canvas for online learning, webinars, and Constant Contact newsletters . Some mentioned virtual meetings have made it ea sier to get together than before. Thou gh several key informants mentioned using social media and finding it effective at reaching people, some cau tioned against i t because pe ople who are not as connected to technology may miss out on the message. Telehealth : Telehealth and telephonic appointments are av ailab le for medical and be havioral health visits, but it is important to remember tha t patients ma y not have access or may need support to access these appointments. Phone cal ls: The phone is commonly used to stay connected. Phone outreach to clien ts, members , participan ts, and patients keep people connected and helps with feelings of isolation for some people , weekly calls, voice mes sages, following up over the phone, having a hotline , sending people messages and giving them a number to call back , voice mail reminders, and conti nuing to call and leave messages 6 with persistence to connect people to the resources they need are ex amples of how organizations are using phone communication during the pandemic. Mailings, flyers, ne wsletters : Printed ma terials are helpful to disseminate information to staff and then they can pass it along to patients, clients , and community members . Key informants mentioned using printed materials, monthly or qu arterly newsletters that are sent out, printa ble guidance or flow charts from CDC and other trusted sources, pictures and visuals and hum or are helpful for people, flyers advertising resources such as 211 or the food pantries ' phone numbers and hours, materials to hand out to people during curbs ide pick up services, mailings with Medicaid HMOs, and printed resources that can be picked up in the community are examples of how this method is used . Wor d of mouth and face -to-face : Key informants mentione d wor d of mouth being an effective communication tool, as well as board me eting s, face -to-face meetings, personal contact from schools to students and families, committees working on outreach at the food pantry, updates that come from prof essionals set an example for the community, encouraging people to check in with their own employees, families , neighbors, and friends, Aurora Health Care 's steering committee municipal update s, live Q & A sessions, and provi ding a case manager role to support families and be a presence in the community where ever people are (schools, community centers, etc.) in case they are not ready to reach out on their own are commu nication strategies that have been helpful. TV, newspapers, mass media: Key informants reported using mass media strategies such as TV screens that have scrolling announcements and provide information about community resources, public service announcements, television statem ents, news broadcasts, newspapers, and radio to communicat e messages. Accura te and timely information : Across all of these strategies , key informants noted it is important for messages to come from a trusted source and to have standard messag ing that r eaches the entire community. It has to be timely, factual, and non -threatening. Other : Other ways key informants mentioned they reach out to the community are through surveys of families and through their registration process es. Two people suggested that articles coming from health care organizations to t he community coul d be helpful and reference d articles coming from the Medical C ollege. State level daily briefings have been helpful for coordination between emergency medical systems and health care. One respondent suggested an impact team collaboration for health systems, the county, and other stakeholders to manage the pandemic moving forward . Suggestions for how health care organizations can reach out to community partners and members to implement health initiatives: Some key informants provided specific metho ds that could be used, some focused on meeting with people to build partnership and the importance of co llaborating, some focused on helping with access to care, sharing information and being a truste d source, and some suggestions were about testing. 7 Methods of outreach : Key informants sug gested outreach through social media (Facebook) , first responders, messages in bus shelters, electronic communication , TV messages, Menomonee Falls village newsletter, cable access, Zoom meetings, phone calls, Google Meet, short vid eo messages, information that people can look up on their smart phone, letters, and home visits. Some emphasized the importance of tailoring the method to you r audience because virtual and online communications are fast and acc essible, but only for people who are online . It misses those without electricity, internet, access to technology, or barriers to using technology. One respondent suggested making online communications easier to understand for those who are newer to the interne t. Partnerships and collaboration : Health care organizations should meet face -to-face ( or through vir tual meetings ) with community organizations , hear the voices of smaller providers, hear what is happening in the community, have small groups meetings to network and talk through issues, reach out to the appropriate staff or leaders in an agency that are empowered to make things happen, partner with school districts to b ring services onsite, reach out to non -profit organizations , include more people to get more ideas, have public events when it is safe to do so again, work with the chambers of commerce to provide education to businesses, create partnerships with commu nity-based organizations so the y can spread yo ur message to the pe ople they work with in the community , per sonally meet with key stakeholders outside of large events, partner with community health centers to bring testing , technology , education, PPE, and bulk supply buying options or price sharing to meet the higher patient demands at this time, be consistent and show transparency and follow through in collaboration with partners , be ex plicit about roles and designate peop le to be a point of contact and make connections in partnership s, organize Zoom meetings to bring leaders together, continue to partne r with public health , coordinate efforts, clarify ex pect ations, and participate in collaborative groups that are already meeting like the Mental Health Advisory Co mmittee, the local Continuum of Care, Crisis Intervention Training, Community Collaborative, and the Heroin Task F orce. It was noted that Pro Health is involved, but others could also be to all ow for more resource sharing and improved access. Access to care : Key informants suggested health care org anizations can hel p with access to care by having Zoom meetings with community partners to explain what services are a vailable through the community that can meet the mental health ne eds of the community, offering mental health services to help the underserved, work on stigma reduction around mental health, expand urgent care hours, go to where people are, increase transportation options to services, address dayca re options for patients, have broader hours and a \" help line ,\" hire a liaison who is in the clinic area that is connected to resource s, community health navigators are needed, offer services like flu shot clinics to organizations, reduce d uplication of services , and look into outreach strategies . Sharing information : Keep information up to date , give organizations suggestions, information packe ts, advise organizations what they can do safely within the current restrictions, continue to provide information on safety precautions, and make assessments for what patients can do to address COVID concerns . 8 Testing : It was suggested health care organizations should continue to offer more C OVID te sting, support organizations doin g testing, offer drive up testing, and be part of an impact team to manag e testing and vaccines as we move forward. B. Focus Area Ranking In 41 interviews, a total of 47 key informants were asked to rank up to 5 of the major health -related issues in their county from a list of 15 focus areas identified in the State Health Plan. (See Appendix A for the full list of informants ). The ta ble below presents the results, including a summary of the number of times an issue was mentioned as a top five health issue, and the number of times informant s ranked the issue as the most important health issue. Importantly, not every informant ranked five issues and not every informant provided rankings within their top selections . In int erviews with more than one participant, only one set of rankings was provided. The results in the table below reflect the 41 rankings . In addition to these rankings, ke y informants were able to write in and rank other issues they perceived as top -five health issues for the county. One informant included skilled nursing beds, one included housing, one included dementia, and one included \"resiliency of youth.\" More detail s about these topics are included in the Issue Summaries section of this report. Key Informant Rankings Health Focus Area Top 5 Number 1 Mental Health 37 18 Substance Use and Abuse 24 2 Access to Health Care 18 8 Chronic Disease 17 1 Nutrition 11 3 Adverse Childhood Experiences 9 3 Communicable Disease 9 2 Alcohol Abuse 9 1 Physical Activity 9 1 Healthy Growth and Development 4 0 Injury and Violence 3 0 Oral Health 3 0 Environmental and Occupational Health 1 0 Tobacco Use and Exposure 0 0 Reproductive and Sexual Health 0 0 9 C. Top Five Health Issues The five health issu es ranked most consistently as top five health issue s for the County were: 1. Mental Health 2. Substance Use and Abuse 3. Access to Health Care 4. Chronic Disease 5. Nutrition Summaries of themes for each issue are presented below in the order listed in the table above . As a guide, issues ranked as the top five priorities for Waukesha County a re marked with this thermometer symbol: D. General Themes Since the last release of this report in 2017, the health focus areas have changed slightly. Alcohol Abuse has been separated from Substance Use and Abuse, whereas they used to be ranked as one category. Adverse Childhood Experiences has been added as a focus area to be ranked. Fina lly, key informants are now able to write in and rank other health issues that are salient to them, but not present in the State Health Plan. In 2017, 47 key informant interviews were conducted with 71 total key informants contributing to those interview s, which i s slightly more sets of rankings than in 2020 . The top five health issues for the county have remained very similar from 2017 to 2020. Mental Health was the top issue in 201 7 and remains such in 2020. Alcohol and Other Drug Use was ranked seco nd in 201 7, and Substance Use and Abuse remains the number two issue for 2020, though Alcohol Abuse is ranked eighth in 2020 . Chronic Disease Prevention and Management was ranked third in 201 7 and is ranked fourth in 2020. Access to Health Services was ranked fourth in 2017 and the comparable category, Access to Health Care, is ranked third in 2020. Nutrition was ranked fifth in 2017 and holds the same ranking in 2020. Among health issue areas not ranked in the top 5, Injury and Violence wa s ranked less highly in 2020, moving from the sixth ranked issue in 2017 to the number 11 issue in 2020. Communicable Disease Prevention and Control was ranked 11 in 2017 and has risen to number 7 in 2020. In 2020, the COVID -19 pandem ic informed h ow key informants though t about the health focus areas. The pandemi c exacer bated issues like mental health concerns , substance use and abuse, and lack of access to health care , which had already been top issue s for the county prior to 2020. Across issues, main the mes were improving access to care , services, and support, working together across sectors to better serve people in the community , and thinking about how to best serve the most vulnera ble people in the county \u2014seniors and other s living in isolation, people experiencing homelessness or food 10 insecur ity, adults with multiple health conditions , and community members who are more vulnerable due to d iscrimination and racism. E. Issue Summaries Mental Health Thirty -seven key informants ' interview rankings included Mental Health as a top five health issue , and eighteen ranked it number one. Existing Strategies: Agencies that deal with mental health and substance abuse have been collaborating, Impact 211 access, access to mental health medications through Direct Relief, substanc e abuse waiver to prescribe, meeting with clients in environments where they feel comfortable, National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Waukesha works on client referrals, follow through, and trainings for family members, free coun seling at James Place, peer support programming, Friendship House, telehealth appointments expand access and can help people open up by doing the appointment where they are comfortable, app -based exercises to reinforce elements of support outside of clinic al time, school- based services are helpful to meet the most vulnerable kids, resources in the schools and support for social and emotional wellness, schools proactively addressing trauma with students, social workers in medical settings, increased awarenes s of this issue, mental health navigators through a grant from the state, internal processes that include depression screening, Menomonee Falls Collective Impact Mental Health Workgroup, Criminal Justice Collaboration Committee, Crisis Intervention Trainin g for law enforcement officers, local approaches to issues such as police department at the farmers market to talk about suicide prevention, trauma -informed care, Sixteenth Street Community Health Centers provides bilingual services for mental health , effo rts to support caregive rs, the Aging and Disability Resource Center works to provide resources and referrals, coalitions focused on suicide awareness, and QPR suicide prevention trainings in the community are examples of strategies in place to address ment al health in the county . Barriers and Challenges: The pandemic has increased isolation, stress, depression, and suicide and losing jobs and family members has been a challenge for everyone, there are not enough providers and waiting lists for appointments, especially for psychiatry and inpatient beds for children , lack of insurance coverage or services for people who lack insurance, the high cost of medications and medication management, telehealth can expand access, but there are barriers to using it if pe ople do not have the technology and internet access they need to engage in it, there still needs to be a face to face component, though it is improving, there is still stigma associated with mental illness and seeking help , social media worsens mental health conditions and conce rns, there are still silos across systems, people have some trouble accessing appointments due to challenges with transportation and child care, patients with unmet basic needs like food and shelter can struggle with treatment adherence, people 11 are unsure of where to start or how to access care, and co -occurring problems with chronic disease or substance use are barriers and challenges to improving mental health. Needed Strategies: More providers, more psychiatry extenders, shorter wa iting periods, better access with and without insurance, small group support and counseling, peer support, telehealth appointments, virtual appointments, \"drop in\" phone calls and doing more to reach people, health care systems need to be the hubs of services, expand social and emotional wellness supports, more community partnership and collaboration, continued public messaging to decrease stigma around mental illness and better understanding of the issues with less judgement, work with NAMI to identify addit ional strategies, inp atient facilities in Waukesha County for protective custody, more beds for uninsured mental health patients, more work against bullying in schools, especially related to social media, strategies to address substance use and mental heal th together, increasi ng access for businesses to get help from health care organizations on trainings and education, partner with business chambers to get the message out, people need more information and proactive messaging about mental health, more suppo rts for homelessness and joblessness, more community resources for housing, more case management or social services, stronger suicide prevention efforts, better recruitment and retention into behavioral health careers, supports for practitioners to prevent burn out, and being proactive about what we can do to address gaps and be better prepared for a situation like the pandemic in the future are suggestions for strategies that could potentially improve mental health in Waukesha County. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Health systems, health care providers, non -profit organizations, county programs, NAMI Waukesha, Waukesha County, Aging and Disability Resource Center, public health, school districts, funders, churches and faith -based organizations, YMCA's afterschool pro grams, law enforcement, Homeless Engagement and Resource Team, homeless shelters and outreach programs, school groups, social service agencies, senior centers, chambers of commerce, criminal justice, public safety, la w enforcement, municipalities, food pa ntries, local colleges and universities who have psychology and mental health or behavioral health -oriented programs, Suicide Awareness Task Force, Children and Family Services Advisory Committee, Hispanic Community Ce nter, The Women's Center, James Place, Salvation Army, Community Action Coalition, La Casa de Esperanza, LSS Clubhouse, Hebron House, and community members with lived experience should work on improving mental health. Subgroups/populations where efforts co uld be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Seniors and people with disabilities, especially those who have lost their jobs and cannot afford COBRA , can be reached through social media, mailings, and at places where they already go like senior center s, recreation centers, food pantries, meal programs, medical appointments, and their care givers. There could also be partnerships with assisted living facilities to do education on site. Medically underserved populations can be reached through free clini cs and Federally Qualified Health Cent ers and there should be a focus on changing policies so more people can be covered by insurance. 12 People experiencing homelessness may need extra support and can be reached where they are at, by outreach programs that a lready exist or in shelters. Youth can be reached through schools, afterschool programs, sports, and other places they spend their time. There is a need to focus on stressors and how they deal with stress to cope and prevent mental health issues. A curri culum taught by mental health professi onals would be helpful. Men who are experiencing chronic homelessness and mental illness can be reached by working with the Salvation Army and Hebron House as these organizations have the closest contact. There are also street outreach resources. It woul d be good to have a physical space or walk -in clinic where they could go for help. Some key informants suggested it is important to be there for Black people and other people of color to support mental health and addre ss trauma. It is also important to hire staff and mental health professionals who reflect the community served. For the Hispanic community it is important to address the stigma around counseling and treatment and address the cultural challenges around ment al health. It is also important for organizations to hire more bilingual staff. Some key informants mentioned that it affects everyone and there should be community -wide strategies like media messaging to reach everyone with information. Substance Use a nd Abuse Twenty -four key informants ranked Substance Use and Abuse as a top-five health p riority for th e county, with two of them ranking it as their first health priority area. Existing Strategies: Naloxone training offered by the county, prevention education, Your Choice presentations, good collaborations like the Waukesha County Heroin Task Force, medication assisted treatment (MAT), support groups and other supportive transitions out of rehab, dru g testing of athletes in schools, FACT - tobacco and vaping outreach to students, partnerships b etween schools and law enforcement, drug collection programs, responsive services after students have gotten in trouble, individual, family, and group therapy fo r substance use disorders (SUD), outreach through the Aging and Disability Resource Center, drug treatment courts and referrals to treatment services rather than jails , the county and law enforcement work well together, support for mothers with SUD, attention is being given to the opioid crisis, and intensive outpatient treatments are the s trategies in place to address substance use and abuse in the county. Barriers and Challenges: Key informants na med a number of challen ges to addressing this issue , including a lack of crisis services or any services outside of 9am -5pm business hours, inpatient care is limited, services and treatment are expensive, it can be hard for people with Medicaid or without health insurance to find treatment options, COVID -19 has made it difficult for people to access services in person and l oss of jobs has meant loss of insurance so people may no longer have access to services they need, lack of transportation, lack of follow up after leaving a rehab setting, peer pressure, cultural 13 norms, ease of access to substances , and the social acceptability of alco hol abuse, vaping, and use of other drugs, and on the other hand, the stigma of addiction and u se of certain drugs and some perceptions that it is a moral failing , the use of alcohol and drugs to relieve or cope with stress, co - occurring unmanaged mental h ealth issues are masked with substance use, when people are isolated the issue can be hidden, some parents are unaware of the issue and challenges in the county, competing services in the community rather than collaboration or a cohesive approach, and ther e are siloed approaches in different sectors without anyone \"owning\" the problem, though the co unty is a leader there is not enough funding. Needed Strategies : Some examples of strategies that could potentially address this issue are crisis services and treatment or support services available outside of 9am -5pm business hours, walk -in services with open door services beyond scheduled appointments, more collaboration among those doing prevention and treatment work, universal health care or treatment options for people who are uninsured and cannot pay out of pocket, broader offerings for MAT so it is accessible everyone who needs it , more counseling services, more funding for programs, continuous outreach to patients leaving rehab and support across various st ages of recovery, better integration of the justice system with treatment, better strategies to address vaping through education, vape detectors, making products harder for young people to obtain, address vaping at pediatric and primary care appointments, better public messaging about the dangers of vaping any substances, education for parents to se e signs their children are using substances and support for those parents and families, more resources for addressing root causes upstream, more peer support and case management models for SUD so people don't encounter gaps, outreach to the business commun ity and to employees, messaging to address stigma of addiction and seeking help, and resources to support people seeking help. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Case workers, hospitals and health systems, non -profit organizations, county resources, public health, health care providers, law enforcement, emergency services, the justice system, legislators, school districts, churches, shelters, mental health care providers, liquor stores, bars, libraries, parks and recreation departments, Sixteenth Street Community Health Centers, Rogers, Waukesha Memorial, Narcotics Anonymous, NAMI Waukesha, The Women's Center, American Lung Association, Your Choice to Live, Waukesha County Heroin Task Force, Substance Use Advisory Committee, Intoxicated Driver Committee, WisHope Recovery, Waukesha Comprehensive Treatment Center, Addiction Resource Council, Hope Center, Elevate, and Lutheran Social Services were named as the k ey partners in the community to work on this issue. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Some key informants believed children and teens need education through schools, social media, sports, therapy, and collaboration with experts. Parents also need education and support about signs to look for and remaining engaged in their children's lives and understanding that families may need help if parents are using as well. 14 People experiencing homelessness can be reached through HEART, the Homeless Engagement And Response Team subgroup of the collaborativ e with NAMI Waukesha, health care organizations, emergency services, and housing services. The elderly and people with disabilities can be reached through existing programs developed to work with these populations. One key in formant named a few differen t key groups: integrated SUD treatment and MAT , SUD groups for women, SUD groups for clients who have behavioral health and co -occurring disorders, and SUD services for teens. These would require adequate staffing of providers a nd improved marketing of the programs. The Hispanic population may need specialized outreach because there can be fear about seeking treatment, especially if they are not legal residents. It was suggested they could be reached in health care settings. Materials should be available in multiple languages and be culturally appropriate. Another idea is targeted marketing in Spanish communicating the idea that it is okay to talk about this issue. Some key informants emphasized that this is a community wide issue and there needs to be a community effort to address it. There could be a better review of data to determine where there may be disparities and realign the taskforce to review the data and determine what the targets should be. Access to Health Car e Eighteen informants includ ed Access to Health Care in their top -five health issues for the c ounty and eight ranked it as their number one issue. Existing Strategies: Health systems are creating more satellite locations, there are options for care for people who have health insuran ce and money, organizations that have a \"medical home\" model, there are some safety net options for people who have Medicaid or are un - and under -insured, such as Sixteenth Street Community Health Centers, Lake Area Free Clinic, Community Outreach Health C linic, telehealth/telemedicine appointments, transportation to appointments for the elderly and disabled, school nurses on staff in school districts, community resources are shared with families from the schools, after hours care is expanding for those who work during normative office hours, there are discharge planners at emergency departments and urgent care centers, some senior housing and assisted living offer skilled nursing and consulting doctors onsite, apps that help people save money on prescriptio ns, so cial workers that help connect families to appropriate resources, care coordination and focus on meeting wraparound needs beyond medical care, communication and collaboration between organizations that serve vulnerable patients, and strong partnerships bet ween schools, public health, and health care are examples of strategies in place to increase access to health care. Barriers and Challenges: One challenge often mentioned was lack of access to care for uninsured patients, lack of insurance coverage, especi ally as people have been losing employment in the 15 pandemic, and lack of coverage for mental health services. Other major barriers seem to be lack of transportation to appointments, lack of appointments outside of traditional business hours, lack of capacit y to care for everyone, trouble navigating the insurance marketplace, Medicaid paperwork, Medicare enrollment without navigators to provide support, language barriers at appointments, especially for Spanish -speaking patients, and obstacles to using t echnol ogy for appointments including the hardware needs, internet access, and literacy about how to use these systems. Other barriers and challenges named by key informants are staff turnover, medical racism and discrimination, people being unsure of wher e to g o for help, lack of basic resources like food, housing, and other social determinants of health -related needs, lack of understanding of signs of trauma from some providers, and fear of seeking services during COVID -19. Needed Strategies: Political and syst emic changes that allow more people access to health care, financial assistance, partnerships to provide more care in schools, increasing access to transportation for appointments, navigators to help people with insurance, appointments, finding trans portat ion, more bilingual staff in health care and community organizations, more opportunities for virtual visits, better communication between primary and specialty care, health care organizations need to be less siloed, community health nurses, better ut ilizat ion of the Family Medicine Residency Program, care coordination, focus on connecting people to basic needs like food and housing, meeting patients where they are at, taking care of patients without exposing clinic providers and staff to COVID -19, and commu nity-focused collaborative efforts/collective impact are potential strategies to improve access to health care. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Health systems, health care providers, Sixteenth Street Community Health Centers and other F ederally Qualified Health Centers, free clinics , Wisconsin Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, National Association of Free Clinics, Family Medicine Residency Program, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, transportation agencies, Ag ing an d Disability Resource Center, Eras, National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Waukesha, school districts, faith -based groups and churches, Sussex Area Outreach Services, community health workers, food pantries, law enforcement, Sussex Community Summ it, no n-profit organizations, Waukesha County Health and Human Services, public health, United Way of Greater Milwaukee and Waukesha County, business community, chambers of commerce, library systems, La Causa, 211, the Salvation Army, Hispanic Resource Cen ter, H ope enter, James Place, The Women's Center, and La Casa de Esperanza were named as the important partners to include in efforts to improve access to health care. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Key inf ormants named several subpopulations where efforts to improve access could be targeted. People experiencing homelessness could be helped with outreach nurses to provide one -on-one help and with organizations who are already serving this population, like sh elters. Seniors and people who may be isolated should be reached through partnerships with organizations who are already serving seniors like recreation departments and senior centers to help identify what 16 needs they are seeing . It may also be helpful to do targeted outreach at churches and in medical settings, and conduct focus groups to better understand their needs. Low-income people need to be linked to appropriate information and resources and may be reached through apartment managers and school s. The Latinx community can be served through Sixteenth Street Community Health Centers and other organizations that support this community and are trusted partners. It is important to deliver linguistically and culturally appropriate messages. People who recently lost their jobs and insurance during the pandemic and do not know how to access care could be helped by working with the community organizations who already offer services to help identify what their needs are and what kinds of assistance they mig ht qualify for. Chronic Disease Seventeen respondents' rankings included Chronic Disease as a top health issue for the c ounty. One of these ranked it as their top health priority area for the county. One respondent focused on obesity, one on cancer, one on hypertension and diabetes, and one focused on the importance of addressing physical activity, nutrition, chronic disease prevention, and mental health at the same time. Other respondents provided general examples of strategies, barriers, partners, and potential interventions for subpopulations. Existing Strategies : Medical treatment, telehealth appointments and nurse follow up, health care providers working with patients on healthy lifestyles, diet, and medication management, clinic programs for chroni c disease patients, free clinics, Waukesha County Public Health, evidence -based programs, the prescription outreach program helps people get medications for free, direct relief program provides access to donated medications and supplies, school health room s and staff, discharge planners from medical care, warm handoffs to follow up appointments after a patient is discharged, partnerships with community -based wellness programs, Fit in the Parks through Waukesha County, employer sponsored health as sessment an d wellness programs with rewards for healthy living, early education and outreach programs in the community, the Live Well group for obesity, the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program's Family Fit program, nutrition education through UW -Extension, Liv e Well Waukesha County, and a Hispanic Wellness Program were examples of health care, public health, and community health strategies to prevent and manage chronic disease in the county. Barriers and Challenges: People need more time and educatio n, there is a need for medication, supplies, and medical care, there are a lack of providers at free clinics, volunteer providers are unable to help during COVID -19, lack of transportation to get to appointments, patients need more support and guidance aft er diagnosis, health care settings can be stressful and patients are often given a lot of information in a short period of time, there is some uncertainty about root causes of disease and why certain groups are able to manage their health better than other s (e.g. gender differences), medical care and prescriptions are very expensive, there is a lack of general awareness and education about chronic 17 disease, culturally there is a lot of confusing information about fad diets, outdated nutrition guidelines , body image iss ues, and a cultural acceptance of alcohol and unhealthy food consumption, lack of investment of time in preventive measures for wellness, incompatible medial records between health systems, lack of case management and patient outreach, lack of a strong ref erral network for Medicaid and uninsured patients, and not connecting patients with resources in the community are examples of barriers and challenges to improving health. Needed Strategies: There is a need for cost- effective and easily accessi ble health services and supports such as medications, healthy meals, and physical activity opportunities, as well as education about why these are importa nt. Community education and outreach programs, community screenings, upstream solutions, awareness of what works and how to access it, better connections to the services and programs that already exist, streamlined referral processes between systems, outreach staff or community health navigators, more telehealth services, and assistance with transportatio n to get to appointments are examples of strategies that could help prevent and manage chronic disease. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Health care providers, health care systems, hospital outreach programs, insurance companies, state and nation al free clinic associations, free clinics, Federally Qualified Health Centers, Waukesha County Public Health, Department of Health and Human Services, the Aging and Disability Resource Center, municipalities, libraries, school districts, faith organization s, UW -Exten sion, food pantries, senior centers and other groups for elders, the business community, Live Well, parks and recreation departments, Carroll University's student clinic for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and exercise physiology, fitnes s clubs, an d non-profit organizations in the community were named as the key partners to work on this issue. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Key informants offered quite a few suggestions for tailoring outreach r elated to chronic disease. Working parents could be reached at doctors' appointments is providers start conversations at primary care appointments. They can also be reached through social media. The age group of 45 -65 years with chronic disease need mo re support than a free clinic can offer, so there should be better connections to case workers. Related to congestive heart failure patients, physicians and the medical community need to deliver a comprehensive message from the physi cian to the scheduler and deliver the message at multiple touchpoints within the care of the patient. Diabetic patients, especially men who seem less likely to receive help. People who chronically experience homelessness may benefit from bringing medical c are to the shelters where they are already. Comorbidities should be addressed together. Low income families or those with Medicaid may need support accessing health services and county -level help. Seniors who may have trouble leaving home, or in assisted o r skilled nursing livin g situations may need more support and can be reached by working with organizations that support seniors or places seniors are going, such as food pantries. 18 Adolescents should receive this health care and education to address it earl y. They can be reached at schools. Cancer support groups. Undocumented Hispanic immigrants can use services at Sixteenth Street Community Health Centers as well as screenings in partnership with health systems. Adults and the community in general need more education and can be r eached with mainstream messaging about healthy lifestyle, a county -wide campaign, outreach nurses, print and video educational materials, parish nurses, and community organizations. Nutrition Nutrition was ranked as a top -five issue by eleven key informants and the number one issue by three of them. Existing Strategies: Food pantries and food banks, Hunger Task Force, farmers markets and winter markets, incentivizing shopping for produce at markets thr ough doubling FoodShare, local farms, community garde ns, and gardeners, farm to table boxes, nutrition education from hospitals, information about how to prepare food, FoodWise Nutrition Education program, Teen Cuisine cooking and nutrition education, Wauk esha County Nutrition Coalition, senior meal program and other community meal programs, public health and ADRC programs, and public education campaigns are strategies in place to address nutrition. Barriers and Challenges : The financial and time costs of purchasing, growing, and preparing fresh produce and o ther healthy foods make them inaccessible to some people, lack of transportation and social isolation make it hard for some people to get to healthy food options, a lack of community level nutrition edu cation and health promotion, COVID -19 related constrai nts and stress, food insecurity and food deserts in the county, challenges related to behavior change among adults, lack of funding for programs, and eligibility criteria for some programs are barriers and challenges to improving nutrition. Needed Strategi es: Key informants' suggestions are to f ocus on food insecurity and reaching the most vulnerable , expand mobile food pantries , expand public education on nutrition and cooking and how to do it efficien tly/quickly , partner with local rest aurants on nutriti on education , provide v ouchers for farmers markets, provide social opportunities to get people eating together, especially for elderly , deliver nutrition education to the families of young children to c reate good habits and engage families, have retired nu rses as volunteers at the food pantry help with nutrition education, do more outreach with evidenced -based and research -based program s, and develop m ore community garden concepts or school gardens . Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Feeding America, Hunger Task Force, food pantries, senior centers , Meals on Wheels, farmers markets, grocery stores, churches and faith groups , school districts, ADRC , UW -Extension, Waukesha County Nutrition Coalition, Waukesha County Public Health, health 19 care systems, n on-profits and community groups focused on this area, and the business community were the key partners identified by respondents. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: The subpopulations most frequently nam ed as being higher risk for poor nutrition are youth and families, women as influencers in the home, low income people and families, people experiencing homelessness, Latino families, and seniors and ot her adults who are isolated and have difficulty leavin g home. Youth and families can be reached at schools, non -profits where they receive other services, and food pantries and may need help learning how to prepare foods and what kind of foods make health y meals. Women should be reached at health care appoin tments and given information without judgement. People who have low income or are experiencing homelessness can be reached with social media messaging and meeting them with resources and education where they are at already. Latino families can be reached at St. Joseph's Church in Waukesha, which has a large Latino membership and works with Latino families and businesses. They have hired bilingual educators. Seniors and other isolated adults can be reached through senior housing, partnering with Eras Senior Network, partnering with the Aging and Disability Resource Center's Senior Wellness Programs, providing handouts with information and recipe ideas, provid e education about what to do with ingredients that may be unfamiliar, and find out what the Nutrition Coalition has done and what type of programs need more funding or advocacy. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Nine key informants' rankings included A dverse Childhood Experiences as a top health issue, with three of them rating it the top health issue for the county. Existing Strategies: School systems are identifying this earlier and referring students, more staff have training in ACEs as part of their professional development and are interested in helping students with trauma, there is more trauma- informed care education for school teachers and staff and schools are integrating social emotional learning into the curricula, there are specific organizat ions and programs like The Women's Center, St. Vincent de Paul, and Safe Babies, eye movement desensi tization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy and brain -spotting, ongoing face to face contact with mothers of children at risk for ACEs, and an increased interest in ACEs and trauma with pockets of implementation in businesses and communities becoming trauma -informed and trauma -responsive are strategies key informants shared for addressing ACEs. Barriers and Challenges: There are waiting lists to see providers, trauma is cyclical, it can be hard to treat ACEs because there isn't one distinct approach that works for everyone, the health care community has not fully embraced screening for ACEs as part of a patient's health history, and there is some stigma to talking about these issues. Needed Strategies: Increased training in trauma- informed care because it need s to be embedded in the work people do every day , help parents without judgement, access to transportation, financial education, more education to understa nd what ACEs are and the long- term health outcomes, school partnerships, education for parents and ca regivers, expanded maternity and paternity leave, more 20 resources for safety nets for families, focus on healthy relationships, parenting classes and suppor t, prenatal care, more support for pregnant women, youth mental health first aid training, addressing ACEs in primary health care appointments, and focus on identifying relevant trauma histories at mental health and substance use treatment appointments are suggestions to address ACEs in the county. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: County -based behavioral health programs, social service progr ams and non -profit organizations , peer support groups , law enforcement , teachers and school staff, faith communities, health care providers and systems, experts in treating trauma, g roups that focus on birth to school age children, including child are prov iders, The Women's Center of Waukesha, Hamilton Connects, The Care Center, NAMI, and Parents Place are the partners identified to work on this issue. In a ddition, it was suggested ACEs screening and trauma treatment could be better integrated into health care through stronger partnerships to address these issues. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Most key informants responded that this issue affects all groups and demographics. The specific subgroups identified are: youth, especially young children; pregnant women, new or young parents, and grandparents who are doing caregiving again; and Medicaid beneficiaries who have more than three chronic diseases. The suggestions for how to address this issue is ov erlapping across subgroups and includes these ideas: broadly provide education about ACEs and that is a problem everywhere and requires broad solutions, work with young adults and families to encourage parent engagement and support for young families, supp ort for new working parents, and broad understanding about early childhood development an d learning and encouraging the importance of reading; integrate ACEs screening into health care settings and have a process in place to follow up with higher scoring p atients; make connections among organizations who can provide trainin g, education, suppor t and programming, including faith communities, non -profits, Children's Wisconsin, and the Parents as Teachers program ; and one informant noted it is best to address t he most vulnerable and most affected subpopulations and the whole community will benefit. Communicable Disease Nine key informants' rankings included Communicable Disease as a top health issue for the county , with two of them rating it as the top health is sue. Existing Strategies: Local news and health care facilities help to get the word out about COVID -19, strategies targeting African American communities regarding COVID -19 testing and safety as they may be more vulnerable, health care organizations have COVID -19 hotlines, county nurse meetings, team work throughout the district to address COVID -19, awareness of the importance of hand hygiene, physically distancing, and posting signs to remind people to practice these behaviors, mask requirements, disinfe cting practices, working wi th schools and health care providers, contact tracing, data sharing among health systems and public health, keeping patients with COVID -19 out of clinics to avoid exposing providers, staff, and other patients, delivering positive patients COVID -19 kits wit h PPE and cleaning supplies, medication, food, electrolyte supplements, a thermometer, pulse oximeter, multi -21 lingual educational materials, and a journal to log symptoms, and (non -COVID) vaccine clinics at the Expo are strategies in place to address commun icable diseases. Barriers and Challenges : There are challenges to testing and contact tracing, there is a disconnect between providers and public health regarding the length of quarantine, difficulty addressing students' needs wh en they are learning virtually, the pandemic is stressful on families and parents might need support and education about what they can do to support their kids, politics are getting in the way and there is mistrust of experts, children learn non -compliance with mask wearing from the ir families, people need help discerning what information is valid and trustworthy, there is a lot of misinformation and the climate is hard to navigate, there is mistrust of the government and public health, there are challenges with data availability fro m health systems, there are challenges to telehealth appointments if patients have technology barriers, and lack of PPE are challenges and barriers to addressing communicable diseases. Needed Strategies: Faster testing and results, especially for the best contact tracing protocols, everyone needs to know and follow the rules, people need to come together and do what is necessary to stop the spread, there needs to be an identified strategy and communicate it effectively, there is a role for media in the mes saging, gaining back the public's trust, share data between partners, create an action/impact team, and efforts to work on preparedness for future disasters, epidemics, or pandemics were suggestions for addressing this issue. Key Community Partners to Impr ove Health: All levels of government, health care systems, Department of Health Services, Department of Public Instruction, school districts, social workers, CDC, Health and Human Services, business community, and emergency prepa redness and response teams are key partners to engage around this issue. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Seniors, people with preexisting conditions, African Americans, and Latinos are most impacted by COVID -19 and could receive outreach from health care organizations and the state with targeted mailings. Single parents and low-income families might need extra support with childcare and what to do if children are learning virtually from home. They sho uld receive information on state support systems and information about where to go for resources and help. There can be stigma around asking for help so information should be shared readily with everyone at this time. The pandemic affects everyone, and peo ple should do what they can to control the spread of misinformation. Public health needs to do damage control and physicians should support the field because their patients trust them. People experiencing homelessness can be reached through the HEART grou p at the Housing Coalition. Underserved minority communities can be reached with the free clinics or Sixteenth Street Community Health Centers. Alcohol Abuse Nine respondents' rankings included Alcohol Abuse as a top health issue for the c ounty . One of them rated it as the top health issue . 22 Existing Strategies: Support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Celebrate Recovery , treatment options, halfway and sober living houses, and continuing awareness -building efforts were named as strategies in place to address alcohol abu se in the county. Barriers and Challenges: Some barriers named are related to lack access to treatment or support, such as lack of health insurance, treatment programs that are only available during business hours, lack of resource s for Medicaid patients, limited inpatient care options, lack of transportation to get to meetings, and lack of enough sober housing options. Another set of barriers are related to COVID -19, such as meetings only being virtual at this time and people are d rinking more at home to m anage stress. Another barrier to addressing this issue is the social acceptance of alcohol abuse in Wisconsin culture , and the political power the Tavern League has here. Finally, the nature of alcohol abuse overlapping with mental health issues can make addressing the causes of abuse complex. Needed Strategies: Some ways to improve this issue are to increase access to treatment and support are to offer services outside of conventional business hours, including crisis services, addr essing barriers for the u n- or under -insured, offering services or support groups in multiple languages and in culturally relevant ways, having peer support specialists and case managers for people with substance use disorders to support people with treatm ent and wraparound servic es like meeting employment and housing needs, focusing on addressing root causes rather than criminal punishment, offering more continuing education about available resources and often co -occurring mental health issues for first responders, making connecti ons easier by meeting people where they are rather than expecting them to seek out treatment or support, collaboration between organizations who work on this issue, and hospital systems sharing building space with nonprofit organiz ations to provide more sp aces for programming to occur. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Healthcare organizations, n on-profit organizations like NAMI, Parents Place, White Stone Warrior, Misfits for Jesus, Community Advocates, AA, peer mentors , school districts , counselor s, law enforcement, athletic programs, youth programs/activities , Waukesha County Department of Health and Human Services , Waukesha County Heroin Task Force, Substance Use Advisory Committee, Intoxicated Driver Program Committee, W isHope Recovery, and Addiction Resource Council . Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: The Hispanic population may need specialized outreach because there can be fear about seeking treatment, especially if they are not legal residents. It was suggested they could be reached in health care settings. Materials should be available in multiple languages and be culturally appropriate. Another idea is targeted marketing in Spanish communicating the idea that it is o kay to talk about this issue. Another population who may need targeted outreach are people experiencing homelessness and they can be reached by meeting them where they already are and partnering with outreach organizations doing this work . Youth sho uld re ceive early education in schools. One key informant named a few different key groups: integrated substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and medication assisted treatment (MAT) services, SUD groups for women, SUD groups for clients who have behavioral heal th and co -occurring 23 disorders, and SUD services for teens. These would require adequate staffing of providers and improved marketing of the programs. Physical Activity Nine key informants' rankings included Physical Activity as a top health issue fo r the county . One of them rated it the top issue. Existing Strategies: Key informants emphasized the natural resources of the county as an important part of promoting physical activity, such as the county parks, local parks and recreation departments, Fit in the Parks through Waukesha County's Community Health Improvement Plan and Process, opportunities to access lakes and trails around lakes for recreation, outdoor work out classes, and community gardens provide an opportunity for some outside activity. One ke y informant mentioned elements of the built environment that encourage physical activity, such as dog parks and revitalized downtown areas that include sidewalks. A messaging strategy in place that seems to be working is framing physical activity as a stre ss-reduction measure. One key informant mentioned the variety of activities as being important to engaging people: meeting people where they are at in terms of interest, offering virtual classes for people who prefer to work out at home, and having groups available for specific age groups. One key informant mentioned education as a strategy that is working, by focusing on the population age 60 and older because data show 70 percent of adults in the county have a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater. Barri ers and Challenges: Physical activities may not be accessible to everyone because of costs and fees associated with participation and programs may not have enough funding to reach everyone affordably. Another barrier is time and busy schedules. A co ncern for some people is safety and how to work out safely during the pandemic without exposing oneself to risk. Another barrier for some people is lack of motivation, confidence, and/or accountability and lack of support or feelings of judgement from othe rs. Needed Strategies: To address financial costs, key informants suggested more funding for education about the importance of physical activity and programs to engage people. Another suggestion is emphasizing that physical activity can be free and done in dependently at home or in parks, or with others through walking clubs or other activities outdoors. Another suggestion is better community messaging about the importance of physical activity as well as messaging about goal setting, what a healthy lifestyle is, what a healthy community is , and how being physically active can have benefits for mental health and stress reduction. Other ideas are engaging young people early in their lives through sports clubs, youth sports, and family activities, engaging people in activities virtually during the pandemic, and partnering with organizations who are already doing a good job either with community engagement or with physical activity and expanding upon what is already working well. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Municipalities, school districts , fitness clubs , YMCA, health and wellness oriented businesses , grocery stores, food pantries, health care systems, Oconomowoc Area Foundation, Silver Circle Sports Events, parks and recreation departments, early learning programs, health care providers and systems, Sixteenth Street Community Health Centers, UW Extension health 24 and well -being programs, and Waukesha County Public Health Division were iden tified as the key partners who can work together to improve this issue. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Several key informants believed this is an issue for everyone/ the whole community, but some emph asized the importance of engaging people early in life, seniors w ho may need certain kinds of messaging or programming, and people with lower incomes who may have particular constraints in terms of time and finances. It was suggested that youth could be re ached through schools and clubs and that this is an important dem ographic because their participation can influence the entire family. Seniors should be engaged in a group or social setting to bring people together and prevent isolation and promote continu ed engagement in the social aspect. Lower income people could be engaged with accessible activities and perhaps at locations where they are already receiving services or going to programming, such as non -profit organizations. Healthy Growth and Developme nt Four key informants' rankings included Healthy Growth and Deve lopment as a top health issue for the county. Existing Strategies: The Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program is a great resource and provides good education. Schools teach a healthy gro wth and development curriculum in schools. Some schools also inte grate teaching outside and incorporating the environment into education. There are more opportunities for young people to get exposed to potential careers and opportunities for learning in t he trades and school partnerships with the County Business Allian ce. There is an element of this topic in recovery, within their programming and transitioning to employment that provides self- worth and is critical to the recovery process. Barriers and Chal lenges: Some of the main barriers named are related to parental k nowledge, experience, and access to programming and education to support their children's growth and development. This includes new or first -time parents' lack of experience or knowledge of child development , language barriers, lack of access to childcare , lack of transportation, and financial challenges. Some of these are compounded during the pandemic, and there are additional barriers to attending appointments or programmi ng like difficulty using technology for virtual appointments or lessons, fear of u sing public transportation or going places without proper PPE, less money due to job loss or furlough, and more difficulty for providers and staff to observe children or pare nt-child interactions or to do developmental screening in a virtual encounter. WIC requires well- visits separate from medical well- visits and there are also barriers to accessing those visits. Needed Strategies : To help parents connect with the necessary support, education, and programming, there need to be more social service agencies and community partners able to start important conversations about necessary referrals, more and different types of media used to share information about child development, and more primary care providers referring to WIC if they collect information abou t economic status to know a family qualifies for the program. For career development, there needs 25 to be a broader discussion about career opportunities for people and how to retain talent. This could include more intergenerational volunteer opportunities , more internships for high school level students, and building pathways for people into trades and health care careers. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: County programs, local programs and non -profits , peer to peer groups , families, childcare pro viders, physicians, schools, health systems, mental health care providers, WIC program, vaccine clinics, early childhood programs , the Birth to 3 program , and trades or manuf acturing companies were named as the key partners to work on this issue. Subgroups /populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be target ed: Key informants suggested information could best benefit parents, all ages of children, high scho ol students, and a focus on the un - or under -insured. It was suggested that paren ts and children can be reached through all types of media, parents can be reached where they are out in the community, and high school students can be reached through interns hips and career development education. Injury and Violence Three rankings included Injury and Violence among their top three health issues for the county. Existing Strategies: Some key organizations, programs, and positions currently in place to prevent and address injuries and violence include local Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE ) responders, threat assessment teams (regarding prevention of mass shootings), The Women's Center generally, and specifically their assessment protocols in partnership with the Sheriff's Department and municipalities across Waukesha County, Lad Lake, Family Service of Waukesha, crisis intervention and emergency services, domestic and sexual violence advocates, and the Duluth Model and other violence intervention programs. More generally, access to ongoing counseling and support for families of survivors to unlearn patterns of unhealthy relationships are other strategies in place in the county. Barriers and Challenges: Key informants named a variety of barriers and challenges to addressing this issue. Isolation, stress (financial and emotional), other mental health concerns, and cultural tension in this polarized political climate are social- or community -level barriers. The widespread nature of problems like elder abuse, domestic violence, sex trafficking make them hard to address, but especially at this ti me when people are staying at home-- where abuse or violence may be occurring , learning virtually, and more isolated, it may be difficult to notice the signs of ab use, especially for mandatory reporters, such as in a virtual learning school setting. Anothe r set of barriers are workforce issues: there are not enough trained SANE examiners, on smaller law enforcement teams there aren't as many resources to dedicate to this. Other barriers are issues of access, such as lack of insurance to get the help that i s needed or to manage medications appropriately for underlying mental health issues, and in a geographically diverse county, there can be difficulty accessing serv ices. Needed Strategies: Regarding elders' injuries and abuse, hospitals should follow up if they have not seen a patient regularly to target what issues might be going on but are not diagnosed yet to prevent injuries from falls or dementia- related issue s. There should also be more training for physicians in this 26 area. There should be nurses w ho consult with clients and review medications, trainings for how community organizations and health care workers should be trained, implementing best practices, l ong- term tracking and connection to clients or patients, and more connectivity, partnership, and commitment from health care organizations to support work being done by community -based organizations. One key informant believes the strategies are already t here, but they need additional support. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: The Women' s Center, domestic violence and sexual assault Coordinated Community Response, anti -human trafficking task force, law enforcement, churches, financial institutions , Waukesha County ADRC, and organizations who are already doing this work are the key communi ty partners named by key informants. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: One key informant named school- aged ch ildren and teens as a group to focus efforts toward by providing programs and education about domestic violence, abuse, and assault. Another key informant thought undocumented individuals and families, minority groups, kids aging out of the foster care sy stem, and people who identify as part of the LGBTQ community might be particularly vulnerable to these issues and suggested a broad sweep of the community, such as the school systems, higher education systems, and non -profit social services systems and a c onnection to United Way because they fund agencies in multiple communities and are involved w ith a lot of different subgroups and populations. They also named Waukesha County Health and Human Services and ADRC as ways to reach these groups. Another key inf ormant did not believe this issue affects specific groups, but that there should be increased awareness in general, use of infographics on social media, ensuring providers are trained to see the signs, and utilizing health care providers to spread awarenes s of resources that do exist to their patients. Oral Health Three informants' rankings inclu ded Oral Health as a top five health issue for the c ounty . A main theme across responses is lack of access to dental providers/ services. Existing Strategies: Key informants named referral and oral health services offered by Sixteenth Street Community Heal th Centers, the Marquette University School of Dentistry clinic, free clinics, an oral and medical pilot program through Froedtert Health, and 211 as examples of strategies in place to help serve more people, especially the uninsured or those who cannot af ford care. One key informant mentioned messaging about the importance of oral health to overall health is becoming more u nderstood as health care providers are having those conversations with patients. Barriers and Challenges : Key informants mentioned issu es related to lack of access and lack of knowledge of available resources, including lack of providers to meet demand, lo w reimbursement through Medicaid, lack of providers who accept Medicaid, ineligibility for appointments, trouble connecting to services and making appointments, lack of transportation to appointments, language barriers, and a lack of widespread knowledge among social service agencies and health systems about 27 what resources do exist for patients. One key informant mentioned a lack of under standing of the importance of oral health is a barrier to getting people to seek care. Needed Strategies: There is a need for more funding to pay for more providers and more services for people who cannot afford care, funding for transportation strategies to get people to appointments, connections to dental providers throughout the county, and up -to-date information about wh ere to refer patients for dental care. More health care providers need to be having conversations with patients about the importance o f oral health. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Health systems, local dentists, social service agencies, Marquet te University School of Dentistry, community and free clinics that provide dental services, transportation companies, county government , local and state legislators, 211, and the ADRC's booklet of community resources should be working together to make impr ovements related to oral health. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: The adult Medic aid population can be reached through health systems, dentists, food pantries, shelters, and other social service agencie s. Adults, especially the elderly can be reached through posters, brochures, flyers, and handouts that can be distributed because not e veryone has internet access. Environmental and Occupational Health One key informant included Environmental and Occupatio nal Health as a top health issue for the c ounty , particularly related to job loss and working conditions during the pandemic . Existing Strategies : When there is job loss, additional unemployment funds and FoodShare benefits are beneficial. Barriers and Challenges: COVID -19 is the main barrier. Additionally, fear and people's fear of leaving their houses is a barrier, especially older pop ulations. Businesses being closed and people unable to work is another challenge. Needed Strategies: It seems that there is nothing anyone can do to fix it, and people are waiting it out. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: The state and community officials need to set the rules and regulations to support the issue. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be ta rgeted and how efforts can be targeted: Those people particularly impacted by the virus, such as seniors, people with pre -existing conditio ns, African Americans, and Latinos may benefit from targeted mailings with information. Other Health Issues Four key informants wrote -in and ranked issues beyond those included in the State Health Plan. Summaries of these issues are included, along with c urrent and suggested strategies to address these issues, barriers and challenges to addressing these issues, partners in the county that could work 28 together on these issues, and subpopulations to whom efforts to work on these issues could be targeted. Hous ing: One key informant ranked housing as the top health issue for the county. They indicated there are not many exis ting strategies in place to address this issue. Some barriers include the community's resistance to people who are low income or unhoused living there, the high cost of new housing units, and few housing options and waiting lists for elderly low -income re sidents. They suggested the medical community could put some of their influence and money behind this issue by supporting affordable housin g developments and hearing about what is happening on the ground. They indicated there are churches interested in he lping with this issue. Other key partners to engage around this issue are non - profit organizations. They believe this issue particularly effects the senior population and young, low - income families. One suggestion to address this issue for low -income pe ople is to champion a project to use a piece of land in Mukwonago for low -income housing, but they need financing and support of churches i n the area. Resiliency of youth : One key informant ranked youth resiliency, particularly their ability to function in a fast-paced life, as the top health issue for the county. They identified the Y partnering with the school district to provide leadership volunteer programs, life skills classes , internship experience, family - strengthening programs, and emergency childc are for children of health care workers during the pandemic as examples of strategies in place to address this issue. Barriers to addressing this issue include busy families, challenges reaching children and families virtually, and the length of the progr amming. Virtual programming is becoming more prevalent, but it is hard to have families slow down and commit to it. Additional strategies needed to address the issue are expanded virtual offerings and other opportunities for families to slow down, be in nature, and develop new skills. They key partners to work in this issue are the YMCA, school districts, and churches and religious institu tions. They key population to focus on are youth, but also their families, which requires good communication, focus o n parents and how to work with them as they decide what their children do or don't participate in. A good connection with parents and caregive rs is important. Skilled Nursing Beds : One key informant ranked this as the number three issue for the county. Currently there are partnerships between health systems , health care providers , and skilled nursing organizations. Some barriers to addressing t his issue are the lack of funding, lack of Medicaid reimbursement, the survey process because it takes a lot of time and energy to focus on the \"hot button\" of the day and it gives doubt toward high -performing nursing homes. The system needs to change a l ittle bit, but there is no incentive to take that on. Some suggestions are to raise awareness of this from a fundraising perspective, rebrand skilled nursing, come up with a different regulatory structure, and allow for more decision -making at the local level. The key partners to engage in this are health care systems and providers. A vulnerable population are Medicaid patients because the nursing homes that are doing well have few beds available for these patients, so they end up going to lower level fac ilities. This could be addressed by reducing the financial criteria to allow for more diversity among their resident population s. 29 Dementia : One key informant ranked dementia among their top five health priority issues for the county (a specific ranking wa s not assigned). Existing strategies include the Purple Tube Program and a referral program. A challenge to addressing this issue is the growth of aging populations. Better screening processes and referrals are needed to figure out how to address issues with the growing aging population. A Challenging Behaviors Response Initiative and legislation are also needed. The key informant believed this issue mainly impacts elders and did not provide su ggestions for targeted outreach to this group. Tobacco Use and Exposure Tobacco Use and Exposure was not ranked as a top five health issue by key informants. Examples of existing strategies, barriers and challenges, needed strategies, key partners, and affected subpopulations were not provided. See the \"Substance U se and Abuse\" topic for some discussion of vaping. Reproductive and Sexual Health Reproductive and Sexual Health was not ranked as a top five health issue by key informants. Examples of existing strategies, barriers and challenges, needed strategies, key partners, and affected subpopulations were not provided. 30 Appendix A.
