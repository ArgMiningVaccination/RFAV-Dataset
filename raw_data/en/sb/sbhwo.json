Lot of research is being conducted at different levels as above in the field of AYUSH adopting different guidelines, methods and protocols and ending up research outcomes with low or poor translational value. Only few of them have led to clinical trial and marketing level. This may be attributed to lack of awareness regarding AYUSH strategies for R&D and provisions of Drug & Cosmetic Act related to AYUSH. In spite of availability of several guidelines such as GCP guidelines for ASU drugs, ICMR Guidelines for Bio medical Research for Human Participants, GCP Guidelines published by CDSCO Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, WHO guidelines for traditional medical research and GCP guidelines for ASU drugs published by Ministry of AYUSH, there is no single comprehensive directive to conduct research in AYUSH sector is available. This might be one among the major reasons that has led to Research and Development in AYUSH sector with diverse approaches with low translational value. In view of this, it becomes imperative to develop directives on research practices for various components of AYUSH research sectors for uniform adoption across all stake holders such as research councils, academic institutes, funding agencies engaged in AYUSH research. Considering this, efforts have been made by CCRAS and developed three comprehensive and concise Guidelines focusing on drug development (Standardization and quality assurance), safety and toxicity and clinical evaluation for ready reference of stakeholders. These Guidelines encompassed with research practices may be suitably adopted and followed by investigators in the field of Ayurveda system such as Research organizations, academic institutions and Investigators seeking grant from schemes of different agencies funding for research on AYUSH system, would certainly help the investigators while designing and formulating the proposals and also planning academic industrial research in the field of AYUSH systems. The users may refer other two documents for having an overall idea concerning drug development and R & D in this field. i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l GLOSSARY S.No. Terms with definitions 1.

Ayurveda-the science of life, evolved as a comprehensive system of healthcare systematically through scientific experimentations of high order backed by sound and reproducible evidence base and stood the test of the time. Several strategies and road maps are being drawn to carry forward merits of this science so as to meet the current day health needs and mainstream its core strengths alongside through research & development in this country and across the globe. The fundamental aspects of holistic systems need adequate positioning, while designing clinical trials to examine the safety and efficacy of Ayurveda approaches. Furthermore, the other challenges and issues related to quality and safety viz. dosage forms/delivery system, diverse concepts and complex approaches in trial design, diagnosis and therapy, outcomes of clinical efficacy and drug interactions also pose certain limitations in research. A holistic approach may be adopted to validate the therapies and approaches with integration of principles of Ayurveda and bio-medicine without losing the vital fundamentals of both systems. Such an approach with well designed research plans could possibly facilitate to generate tangible evidence. The areas of clinical research broadly comprise validation of the fundamental principles of Ayurveda; Validation and development of diagnostic/assessment tools ; standardization and validation of the therapy/ procedures; to establish dosage form, dose, duration, indication of any given drug as per the classics and to develop new regimen. The expertise and experience of the investigators, all the equipments and infrastructure, trial drugs, necessary diagnostic methods and availability of participants according to the requirements of research question should be examined carefully and thoroughly to achieve the outcomes ( Upaya). A critical review of Ayurvedic literature reveals the reflection of epistemology of Ayurveda and its robust approach towards Research & Development. The methodical approaches adopted from Darshanas (Doctrines of Philosophy) form the basis of research tools for generation of evidence and development of classical Ayurvedic texts i.e. Samhitas. They comprise the following- iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll Aptopadesa (Evidence base inference) Upamana (Analogy: Comparative /Control design) Yukti (Reproducible Experimental Evidence) The two way approach of experimentation and drug trials as mentioned in Samhitas forms the roots of clinical trial. As such, Sushruta Samhita narrated the methods and approaches viz. feasibility of test intervention (Tatlingatwat), observational design (Dristaphalatwat), System validation ( Agamaatsya ), for testing an intervention and interpretation of observations in the context of Kriyakala (stages of etiopathogenesis of a disease) which reflect the reverse pharmacology or reverse renovation approach of contemporary period. This could be well utilized as fast screening method of test interventions. Further, Maharshi Charak's approach emphasizes on meticulous design and reproducibility. This comprise the issues such as Feasible ideology / Hypothesis (Budhipashyati-ya-bhavaan), multi dimensional approach in planning and assessment (Bahukaranayogajaari), appropriate design ( Yukti-Yojna) perpetually valid outcome and reproducibility ( Yuktihtrikalah ). The concepts and methods are developed in course of time adding several new drugs, interventions and approaches right from Vedic period, Samhita period, medieval period and current era enriching the Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia and pharmaco-therapeutics.The evolution of Ayurvedic Pharmacopeia is depicted in Table 1.

Potential Risks The relevant literature or other sources of information with reference may be reviewed for any potential risks of the study/interventions to human participants and should be provided in the background. Any risk reported in the pre-clinical study must also be provided .Further, if the Principal Investigator (PI) predicts any other risks to human participants should be addressed in the background.1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 2.3.2.5. Potential Benefits The potential benefits in terms of physical, psychological, social, legal, economic, or any other benefits (payment to the participant if any, is not considered) to the human participants Should be mentioned. Further, if Investigator predicts any other benefit that may also be recorded. 2.4. Study Objective An objective is the reason for performing the study i.e. to find answer of the research question by the analysis of data collected during the study. The objectives of a study should be clearly specified from the beginning as it forms the basis for study design. These typically include: Statement of purpose, e.g., to assess, to determine, to compare, to evaluate General purpose, e.g., efficacy, safety, health seeking trends, epidemiological studies Specific purpose, e.g., dose-response, superiority to placebo, non-inferiority to current standard of care. Name(s) of intervention (e.g., procedure, drug, behavioral intervention) being evaluated, specification of doses or dose ranges to be studied, dose regimens etc. A clinical study mainly has a primary or core objective. Other additional objectives, if any, are called secondary objectives. For example- If in a study, the effect of Medohara Guggulu on Sthaulya (obesity) is to be assessed then the primary objective may be written as \"To assess the effect of Medohara Guggulu on weight loss/ Sthaulya (obesity) and if the clinical safety/improvement in the quality of life or increase in work efficiency, etc. have to be assessed, then these maybe treated as secondary objectives. 2.5. Study Outcomes An outcome is an observation variable or changes recorded in the study at one or more time points from the baseline after enrollment of the participant in the study. It is the end point or measurements required in line o f the objectives. 2.5.1. Primary Outcome Measures The end point of the primary objective is called primary outcome measure. Generally, there should be just one primary variable, with evidence that it will provide a clinically relevant, valid, and reliable measure of the primary objective (e.g., laboratory procedures, changes in the signs & symptoms, safety assays, etc). General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 2.5.2. Secondary Outcome Measures The endpoints of additional or secondary objectives are called secondary outcome measures. But any other results found at the time of data analysis and interpretation of study results are also the secondary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures should be included, whether or not they add information about the primary objective or address secondary objectives. Discuss their importance and role in the analysis and interpretation of study results. For example- I f in a study, the effect o f Medohara Guggulu on Sthaulya (obesity) is to be assessed and the primary objective is weight loss, then \"To see the changes in the weight from the baseline at the end o f 1st or 2nd or 3rd months o f the treatment\" [according to the interval (continuous, binary, event times) when the expected changes by the effect o f the intervention to be observed] \"will be the primary outcome measure. Changes in the lipid profile, changes in the quality o f life, etc. may be considered as the secondary outcome measure. 2.6. Study Design The scientific integrity of the study and the credibility of the data from the study depend substantially on the study design. A description of the study design should include: A description of the type/design of study to be conducted (e.g., placebo-controlled, double\u00ad mask, parallel design, open-label, dose-escalation, dose-ranging) A description of the study population (e.g., healthy/sick, in-patient/out-patient) A discussion of the rationale for design features Phase of trial Single or multicenter The number of study groups/arms Prospective or Retrospective or Cross-sectional study Description of study groups/arms including sample size (including a table, if appropriate) Approximate time to complete study enrollment The expected duration of participant participation Identification of the test agent and specifics of administration of other agents (e.g., placebo) A description of the sequence and duration of all trial periods, including follow-up (specify individual participants vs. entire trial) Changes in scheduling, such as dose escalation Any stratifications1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions Methods for collecting data for assessment of study objectives Other protocol-specific details, such as centralization of evaluations (e.g., central laboratory or central reading center for clinical scans) Interim analysis plans 2.6.1. Phases of clinical trial for Ayurvedic drug / Patent or Proprietary Medicines A systematic study of Ayurvedic drug / Patent or Proprietary Medicines on human participants - (Whether participants or non-participant volunteers) - in order to discover or verify the clinical, pharmacological (including pharmacodynamics / pharmacokinetics), and / or adverse effects, with the object of determining their safety and / or efficacy. 2.6.1.1. Human Pharmacology (Phase I) i. The objective of studies in this Phase is the estimation of safety and tolerability with the initial administration of an Ayurvedic Drugs / Patent or Proprietary Medicines into human(s). Studies in this Phase of development usually have non-therapeutic objectives and may be conducted in healthy volunteers or certain types of participants. Ayurvedic drug / Patent or Proprietary Medicines with probable toxicity e.g. Ayurvedic drug / Patent or Proprietary Medicines with Schedule E-I ingredients are to be studied in participants. Phase I trials should preferably be carried out with access to the necessary facilities to closely observe and monitor the Participants. ii. Studies conducted in Phase I, usually intended to involve one or both of the following objectives:- a. Maximum tolerated dose: To determine the tolerability of the dose range expected to be needed for later clinical studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These studies include both single and multiple dose administration. b. Early measurement of Drug activity: Preliminary studies of activity or potential therapeutic benefit may be conducted in Phase I as a secondary objective. Such studies are generally performed in later Phases but may be appropriate when drug activity is readily measurable with a short duration of drug exposure in participants at this early stage. 2.6.1.2. Therapeutic exploratory trials (Phase II) i. The primary objective of Phase II trials is to evaluate the effectiveness of an Ayurvedic drug / Patent or Proprietary Medicines for a particular indication or indications in General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions participants with the condition under study and to determine the common short term side-effects and risks associated with the drug. Studies in Phase II should be conducted in a group of participants who are selected by relatively narrow criteria leading to a relatively homogeneous population. These studies should be closely monitored. An important goal for this Phase is to determine the dose(s) and regimen for Phase III trials. Doses used in Phase II are usually (but not always) less than the highest doses used in Phase I. These studies should be intended to provide an adequate basis for marketing approval for Ayurvedic drug / Patent or Proprietary Medicines. ii. Additional objectives of Phase II studies can include evaluation of potential study endpoints, therapeutic regimens (including concomitant medications) and target populations (e.g. mild versus severe disease) for further studies in Phase II or III. iii. These objectives may be served by exploratory analyses, examining subsets of data and by including multiple endpoints in trials. 2.6.I.3. Therapeutic confirmatory trials (Phase III) i. Phase III studies have primary objective of demonstration or confirmation of therapeutic benefits(s). Studies in Phase III are designed to confirm the preliminary evidence accumulated in Phase II that a drug is safe and effective for use in the intended indication and recipient population. Studies in Phase III may also further explore the dose-response relationships (relationships among dose, and clinical response), use of the drug in wider populations in different stages of disease, or the safety and efficacy of the drug in combination with other drug(s). ii. For Ayurvedic drug / Patent or Proprietary Medicines intended to be administered for long periods, trials involving extended exposure to the drug are ordinarily conducted in Phase III, although they may be initiated in Phase II. These studies carried out in Phase III complete the information needed to support adequate instructions for use of the drug (prescribing information). iii. For Ayuvedic drug / Patent or Proprietary Medicines approved outside India, Phase III studies needs to be carried out primarily to generate evidence of efficacy and safety of the Ayurvedic drug / Patent or Proprietary Medicines in Indian participants when used as recommended in the prescribing information. Prior to conduct of Phase III studies in Indian participants. iv. If the application is for the conduct of clinical trials as a part of multi-national clinical development of the drug, the number of sites and participants as well as the justification1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions for undertaking such trials in India should be provided to the Licensing Authority along with the application. 2.6.I.4. Post Marketing Trials (Phase IV) Post Marketing trials are studies (other than routine surveillance) performed after drug approval and related to the approved indication(s). These trials go beyond the prior demonstration of the drug's safety, efficacy and dose definition. These trials may not be considered necessary at the time of new drug approval of Ayurvedic drug / Patent or Proprietary Medicines but may be required by the Licensing Authority for optimizing the drug's use. They may be of any type but should have valid scientific objectives. Phase IV trials include additional drug-drug interaction(s), dose-response or safety studies and trials designed to support use under the approved indication(s), e.g. mortality/morbidity studies, epidemiological studies etc. NOTE: For classical Ayurvedic drugs with same textual indications, directly phase III/IV trial may be conducted. For classical Ayurvedic drug with new indications/Patent or Proprietary Medicines, directly phase II trial may be conducted. Patent or Proprietary Medicines with Schedule E-I ingredients, Phase I trials may be conducted as appropriate. 2.6.2. Types of the clinical study A clinical study involves research using human volunteers (also called participants) that is intended to add to medical knowledge. There are mainly two types of clinical studies: experimental studies and observational studies. 'Brief descriptions o f these studies are as under: 10 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l Figure 5: Types of clinical studies 2.6.2.I. Observational Study An observationalstudy is one which tries to explore the cause-and-effect relationships. Like experimental study the Investigators is not able to control the participants by allocating in groups or assigning any particular treatment. The Investigators only observe the participants involved and their responses by asking questions, or taking some measurements, or looking at clinical records. A sample survey is an example of an observational study. Followings are observational studies: General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 11 Case series studies: Case-series is a descriptive study design wherein a series of cases of any particular disease that one might observe in one's clinical practice, hospital and so on is presented. There is no control group in this type of study. In terms of evidence, this is a weak study design but it can help provide leads in designing research studies. Case reports: Documentation of reports on a single participant constitutes case reports. They do not use control groups and hence do not have high statistical validity or cannot provide conclusion about the causality but can provide leads to formulation o f a hypothesis for potentially high impact research studies. Case control studies: When a correlation is drawn between factors or exposures as causal in participants who have a specific health condition. These studies are retrospective when the history and reports of the participant is analyzed and a correlation is drawn if they might have been causal. This is compared with the history and reports of participants who do not have the health condition. This level of evidence in such studies is low when compared to randomized controlled trials or cohort studies because just a statistical association do not necessarily conclude cause and effect relationship. For example- tobacco and cancer. Cohort studies: A 'cohort' meaning is a population who are exposed to similar environmental conditions. This is a kind of observational study where one group of a cohort with exposure to a particular causative agent or a treatment is compared with a similar group who are not exposed. They are followed up prospectively. The level of evidence here is lower when compared to randomized controlled trials. For example, tobacco use among working and none working adolescents. Cross sectional studies: A cross sectional study is an observational study that aims at determining the exposure and prevalence of disease at the same point in time in a given population for e.g., prevalence of post traumatic stress disorders in people after Tsunami. It can also be used in determining the sensitivity and specificity of new diagnostic tests. 2.6.2.2. Experimental Study In a clinical trial, participants receive specific interventions according to the research plan or protocol created by the Investigators. These interventions may be medical products, such as drugs or devices; procedures; or changes to participants' behavior, such as diet. Clinical trials may compare a new medical approach to a standard one that is already available, to a placebo that contains no active ingredients, or to no intervention. Some clinical trials compare 12 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions interventions that are already available to each other. When a new product or approach is being studied, it is not usually known whether it will be helpful, harmful, or no different than available alternatives (including no intervention). The investigators try to determine the safety and efficacy of the intervention by measuring certain outcomes in the participants. The scientific integrity o f the trial and the credibility o f the data from the trial depend substantially on the trial design. Single arm trials: Single arm trial is the simplest trial design. A sample of participants with a particular disease is administered an intervention and the effect is measured after a decided period of time to observe the response. This design is adopted where placebo effect is minimal or there is no scope for incorporating or it is unethical to include a placebo arm. The level of evidence is low in this design usually. However, it is apt for validation o f Panchakarma procedures, application o f leech, Agnikarma, Ksharasutra, etc. Cross over trials: In a cross over design, the objective is to compare the effect of therapies. The trial participant is randomly allocated to one treatment protocol for a period of time and then later after a wash out period, the same participant is randomly allocated to another treatment protocol and the effects of treatments are compared. Factorial Trials: Factorial designs are considered when the objective of the study is to compare effects of a minimum of two treatment protocols either alone or in combination. For example, if there are two interventions A and B then group-1 is given intervention A, group- 2 is given B, group- 3 is administered both A and B and group- 4 is given neither. Factorial designs are considered when the effects o f more than two interventions are to be evaluated. Non inferiority trials (Active Controlled trials): This type of trial design consists of testing the effect of a particular treatment in comparison with an available standard treatment. Non inferiority trials are designed to effectively evaluate the effect of a particular intervention where incorporation of a placebo group is unethical. Parallel design: Placebo controlled trials: A placebo is an agent that produces an effect on the disease through a psychological mechanism i.e., through a non specific effect which does not comply with a definable, physiological mechanism. Therefore, placebo effect needs to be nullified to prove that drug /therapy /formulation intended to produce an effect on the disease occurs genuinely through a definable bio - physiological mechanism. Placebo controlled design with randomization and blinding produces highest evidence. They require large sample sizes.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 13 Three arms trial: Placebo & active control: This design involves inclusion of a placebo as well as an active control group and provides good internal evidence of sensitivity. Add on Study: An add on study is a placebo-controlled trial wherein a new agent is concomitantly administered in participants in addition to receiving a standard treatment. These kind of studies are useful when the existing treatment is not fully effective and there is evidence that another treatment in addition can bring about better outcomes and if there are no adverse drug reactions or interactions. Replacement study: In this design a new drug or placebo is randomly added to the conventional treatment and the conventional treatment is then slowly withdrawn usually by tapering. This design can effectively evaluate the ability of the participant to maintain the baseline status after withdrawal of the conventional treatment. Early escape rescue treatment: If in a trial, administration of a treatment protocol is either ineffective or if it results in worsening of the disease and who otherwise would require a rescue treatment like in seizures or angina then the trial treatment is withdrawn. Here the need to change the treatment becomes the study end point. This design evaluates short term effectiveness of a treatment protocol. Limited placebo period: In situations where it is not possible to continue the participants for long duration of placebo administration the placebo group is maintained for a short duration and then the trial would go on with an active control group without the placebo group. This design evaluates short term effectiveness of a treatment protocol. Additional doses design: This design involves randomizing participants into parallel groups of different fixed doses of a certain treatment protocol. This design evaluates dose based response. Randomized withdrawal: In this design participants getting a test treatment for a particular period of time are randomly assigned to continued test treatment and placebo. Difference between those receiving continued treatment and those on placebo reveals the effect of active treatment and evaluates the status of remission or aggravation of a particular disease and long term efficacy. No-treatment concurrent control: No treatment concurrent control design involves randomization of participants into test treatment and no treatment. This design can be used when it is not possible to use double blinding. 14 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions External control (including historical control): This is a comparative trial where participants receiving an active treatment is compared with a control from another study at another setting at the same point of time (External control) or if it is taken from a study conducted at an earlier point of time (historical control) it is known as external control. Designs Amenable to test Ayurvedic Therapies Black-box design Generally Ayurvedic treatments are not just isolated administration of a therapeutic molecule or a single drug but, are a combination of drugs/procedures that constitute a therapy for a particular health condition for a particular individual. Therefore, a traditional treatment that may consist of a set of therapeutic procedures should be considered as one single module which is studied in comparison with either placebo or a standard treatment. This allows the Ayurvedic treatments to be determined within its theoretical framework and not compromising with the fundamental principles of traditional medicine. Reverse Pharmacology Design In the realm of traditional medicines, many herb based medicinal formulations have known to have healing effects on many health conditions but such results have not been pursued rigorously through research studies to know the effect of such medications in various complex biological systems. Therefore the concept of reverse pharmacology (RP) helps in addressing the issue where the effect of the Ayurvedic formulation on a health condition is known but the mechanism of action is not known. In this approach the drug candidate travels a reverse path from 'clinics to laboratory' rather than classical 'laboratory to clinics. This concept has three phases as follows RP-Phase I: This involves an experiential phase where comprehensive documentation of clinical observations of the effect of standardized Ayurvedic drug on the biological systems is done. RP-Phase II: The purpose of this phase is to evaluate the target activity of the Ayurvedic formulation/drug/Therapy under in-vitro and in-vivo models tolerability, drug-interactions and dose-range. RP-Phase III: The purpose of this phase is to carry out basic and clinical studies at several levels of biological organization and to identify and correlates of drug safety and efficacy. Studies in this phase should be able to decipher mechanisms of action at multiple biological systems and to optimize safety, efficacy and acceptability of the leads in natural products based on relevant science.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 15 Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll Ethnographic design for folk claims Ethnographic design is one that is used in validation of traditional medical practices. There might be claim of a healing practice from a traditional socio cultural setting in a particular locality. This claim might not have scientific evidence or other documentation. This can become basis from which hypotheses may be generated, and can lead to further research. Designing a placebo in most of the Ayurvedic interventions is not possible as principles of Ayurveda follow the system biology approach where the response to a therapy is evaluated in terms of the body as a whole and not confined individual system. Most of the drugs are also poly formulations consisting of ingredients from plant, mineral and animal origins and not an active molecule as in case of the modem system of medicine. It is very difficult to have the trial drug and placebo are prepared in a way that they are similar in colour, taste, size, weight, same smell and same consistency. Therapy in Ayurvedic system of medicine also involves procedural interventions like Panchakarma in Ayurveda and so on for which designing placebo becomes impossible. In such cases, appropriate control groups can be incorporated like active controls or no interventions etc. Different controls can be used in clinical trials to answer different questions. The use of a placebo, when possible, is desirable, because it generates evidence of better quality. Placebo- controlled trials are intended to establish whether treatment is valuable over and above what might be achieved by a control treatment, and not whether treatment is valuable at all. Thus, it allows Investigators to distinguish specific from non-specific effects of treatment in order to determine whether the additional cost, risk and effort of a specific treatment are worthwhile. It is also important for understanding the mechanism of a treatment. This is true for the evaluation of all drugs. It is not only of academic interest, but is also practical value, especially for developing new treatments from traditional ones. However, in some cases, placebo controlled trials may not be possible. 2.6.2.3. Data Based Studies Systematic reviews: These are studies based on already published studies. A certain review criteria is decided and with a sound methodology, the results of the published studies are scrutinized and summarized for e.g., Effect of herbal medicines with significant effect on Hamilton depression rating scale in participants suffering from depression. 16 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions Meta Analysis: These studies are also based on already published studies. The study compiles and examines the results of number of valid studies on a particular topic and consolidated results are presented for example Meta-analysis of RCTs on the anxiolytic effect of Ashwagandha. Data based studies on Ayurvedic drugs can provide much needed evidence to recommend use o f Ayurvedic interventions among scientific community. Conventionally, the level of evidence is ranked in order of risk of bias and from top to bottom ranked as Meta-analyses, Systematic reviews, Interventional studies, Observational studies and experts' opinions. (See Annexure III- Level of evidence) However, due to classical textual evidence, long history of use and vast clinical experience, this hierarchical ranking of level of evidence may not be completely apt for Ayurveda and its approaches. 2.7. Randomization Randomization is used to develop comparable groups to assess therapeutic interventions. It is essential to control various known, and even unknown, biases. Nevertheless, there are many situations where randomization can be impossible or unethical. The best way to solve this problem is probably by the proper selection of control treatments. 2.7.1. Randomization method and procedure (wherever applicable) Simple random samples: This is a procedure where each individual of a population has equal probability of being selected. A simple random sample is representative of a population and gives external validity. The results obtained have good generalize ability of results. Random number generators are available online. It can also be generated using excel sheet. Random allocation: Random allocation is a procedure of randomly allocating an identified sample to different groups. Each participant has the same probability of being assigned to a particular group. Block randomization: This randomization procedure helps in achieving same sample size in two or more groups. Block randomization is done by generating random permuted blocks (blocking). For e.g., in a block size of six consecutively enrolled participants three can be allocated to one treatment group and three to another. The ratio of allocation can also change. This method helps in interim analysis.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 17 Stratified randomization To avoid imbalances among baseline characteristics, pre-randomization stratification is done based on requirement like Age, Gender, prognostic factors etc. 2.7.2. Methods of blinding Blinding is a process of ensuring that the people involved in a research study (participants or investigators) do not know about what treatment they are receiving. This procedure is incorporated to minimize the biases that arise due to differences in treatment, management, investigator who is carrying out the study, rather who assesses the participants or one who interprets the results. These biases arise because participants who know about the active treatment might report more favorable outcomes. The Raters or Investigators who know about the treatment may over enthusiastically rate the response to a treatment or they might undermine the response to placebo or no treatment. Knowledge of treatment might influence the people to use favorable statistical tests. Open: The participants, investigators, and data analyst know about what treatment they are receiving. Single blind: Here either the participant or investigator does not know about the treatment. Double blind: Here neither the participant nor the investigator knows about the treatment. Triple blind: This is a blinding procedure in which the participant, the investigator and the data analyst does not know about the treatment. 2.7.3. Randomization Codes and Procedures for Breaking the Code Breaking the codes/Un-blinding in case of emergency Randomization codes are computer generated. Requirement for unblinding arises out of an emergency. The Investigator gets the primary information about the emergency and therefore he should have a developed mechanism for breaking the codes. The investigator should access to sealed envelopes 24 hours a day. He can also delegate a suitable person to carry out the code break. The sponsor should be notified about the code break within 24 hours. In a non emergency situation the code- break cannot be done without the approval of the sponsor. Breaking the codes/Un-blinding at the end of the trial Breaking the codes/un-blinding is done by a formal request to the Sponsor and head of the Institute but should not be done until the following events have been completed Completion of last follow up of the participant All data has been entered and validated and there is no scope for further changes 18 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions It is better that the statistician is also blinded until the analysis is complete. information on establishment o f study code, where it will be kept and when, how, and by whom it can be broken in the event o f an emergency. Allocation concealment Allocation concealment is a procedure that ensures that either participants or investigators does not know what is being received by the participant. Ideally, the procedure is done as follows: The trial drug and placebo are prepared in a way that they are similar in colour, taste, size, weight and smell. In double blind study a random sequence of codes is generated centrally and assigned to the prospective participants. Sequentially numbered sealed opaque coded envelopes with aluminium foils to prevent revealing against bright light are assigned to each trial participant with details of the treatment inside. After obtaining the consent, the random code is assigned to the participant. The envelopes are generally stored in the pharmacy and the pharmacist gives the containing drug or placebo to the participant. In single blind studies where the investigator knows about what the participant is going to receive, the centrally generated random sequence of numbers is assigned to the prospective participants in terms of who is going to receive drug or placebo. The sequentially numbered sealed envelopes are coded for drug or placebo. The codes should not be in such a way that if the un-blinding is done for one participant in case of emergency then, it should not reveal the codes for all the participants. For example, if '0' is used to code placebo and '1' to drug, then if an emergency situation necessitates, un-blinding the information about all the participants is automatically revealed. The codes could be generated and kept by the sponsor / central funding agency and will be broken by them in case of emergency. Documentation of decoding during the study Following information needs to be documented before code break- The identity of the person requesting code break Reason for requesting the code break Bottle or box number of the trial medication Participant number Name of the person authorizing the code break procedure *This information should be documented and preserved along with the case record form1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 19 Blind assessment Blind assessment is a critical component of conventional evaluation of therapeutic interventions. However, in the evaluation of efficacy of procedure-based therapies (such as Panchakarma therapy, Ksharasutra, Agnikarma, Jalauka therapy, etc) and Multi drug regime it may be difficult, impractical or impossible for the Investigator to be kept ignorant of what treatment the participants are receiving. Treatment blinding in the evaluation of Ayurvedic medicines should adopt the approach of conventional medicines, e.g. using active and control formulations with similar appearance, taste and weight. However, if the Ayurvedic medicine cannot be administered in a predetermined standardized formulation, it will be impossible to keep the treatment blinded. 2.8. Study period 2.8.1. Total duration of the study Mention the total duration of the study from preparatory phase to analysis of the data. 2.8.2. Timelines with deliverables A timeline is a way of displaying a list of events in chronological order to be happened in the project. Project timeline outline the deliverables (important milestones and task) of a project in chronological sequence. This helps all project resources and stakeholders see what deliverables need to be accomplished next and by what date. Having a visual project timeline that clearly communicates the important milestones and tasks is an essential tool for successful planning or project management. An example is given below- Deliverables Time Lines Pre-trial preparations: Procurement of drugs and equipment, engagement of staff, preparation of CRFs, Institution ethical clearance, arrangement for laboratory investigations, publicity, registration in the CTRI wherever applicable1-3 months Recruitment and data collection 4-18 months Data compilation and analysis 19-24 months Duration of the Treatment :Duration of the participant participation and a description of the sequence of all study periods including follow-up, if any should be recorded. 20 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 2.9. Sample Size considerations The number of participants in a study needs to be adequate, in order to be able to determine any clinically important differences (outcome measures) between the study groups. For this purpose provide all information needed to validate the calculations for sample size, and also to judge the feasibility of enrolling and following the necessary numbers of participants. In particular, specify all of the following: Outcome measure used for calculations (almost always the primary variable) Test statistic Null and alternate hypotheses Type I error rate Type II error rate Assumed event rate for dichotomous outcome (or mean or variance of continuous outcome) for each study arm, justified and referenced by historical data as much as possible Assumed dropout rates, withdrawal, cross-over to other study arms, missing data, etc., also justified Approach to handling withdrawals and protocol violations, i.e., whether participants will be included in the \"intent-to-treat\" population Statistical method used to calculate the sample size, with a reference for it and for any software utilized 2.10. Participant enrollment and withdrawal 2.10.1. Participant Inclusion Criteria Provide a statement that participant must meet all the inclusion criteria in order to be eligible to participate in the study and then list each criterion. Example: Willing to participate and comply with all study procedures for prescribed trial period. Willing for giving the written consent Age and gender Clinical Signs and symptoms fit for the diagnostic criteria of the specific disease condition of the trial Laboratory parameters within a specific range 2.10.2. Participant Exclusion Criteria Provide a statement that any participant meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from study participation and then list each criterion.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 21 Example: Medical condition, laboratory finding, or physical exam finding (e.g., vital signs outside of specific range) that precludes participation Use of disallowed concomitant medications (specify) Pregnancy or lactation Known allergic reactions to components of the study product(s) Treatment with another investigational drug or other intervention (within a specified time frame) History of drug/alcohol abuse Characteristics of household or close contacts (e.g., household contacts who are immune- compromised, residence in same household as a participant already participating in study, if blinding or compliance could potentially be compromised) Anything that, in the opinion of the investigator, would place the participant at increased risk or preclude the participant's full compliance with or completion of the study. 2.10.3. Withdrawal criteria Reasons for Withdrawal and handling of withdrawals Provide a list of reasons participants may be discontinued from the study. It may be appropriate to provide distinct discontinuation criteria for participants. Also note that participants may withdraw voluntarily from participation in the study at any time. Participants may also withdraw voluntarily from receiving the study intervention for any reason. Example: Any clinical adverse events (AE), laboratory abnormalities, inter current illness, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant. The participant meets any exclusion criteria (either newly developed or not previously recognized). Handling of Withdrawals Describe the efforts to follow participants who withdraw from the study. It is vital to collect safety data of any participant discontinued because of an AE or SAE. In any case, every effort must be made to undertake protocol-specified safety follow-up procedures and be given appropriate care under medical supervision until the symptoms of any AE resolve or the 22 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions participant's condition becomes stable. If voluntary withdrawal occurs, the participant should be convinced by the Investigator to complete an end-of-study evaluation. 2.11. Study Procedures 2.11.1. Screening Screening is the procedure to evaluate the eligibility of participant to include /exclude in the study. The investigator / Institution shall also maintain a Participants' screening register to document identification of Participants who are screened for the research study. 2.11.2. Enrollment/Baseline visit A Participant's enrolment register apart from the screening register shall also be maintained to document chronological enrolment of Participants in a particular Study. The baseline visit will be the first day for initiation of the therapy/treatment of enrolled participants/participants. 2.11.3. Follow-up Visit The follow up visits are the subsequent visits attended by the participant in prescribed time period as per the study protocol. 2.11.4. Final Study Visit The final visit is the day of completion of the treatment/study period (follow up period without therapy/treatment, if any) as per the study protocol. 2.11.5. Re-scheduled V isit-if any Re-scheduled visit is the case where the appointment on the scheduled day is not feasible due to certain reasons e.g. either the participant or investigator is not available, etc. 2.11.6. Early Termination Visit-if any Early termination visit is the case where the participant develops either any serious ADR/ADE or non-compliance of the treatment regimen / termination of the study, etc. The same needs to be informed to the Sponsor and the Ethics Committee within two working days. 2.11.7. Laboratory Evaluations The investigations should be done preferably from NABL accredited laboratories. In case of multi-centre studies, the sponsors will take necessary step for selection of a central laboratory taking into consideration that the branches of such laboratories exist at the vicinity of all participating centers and selected laboratory will not further outsource any of the investigations.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 23 Methodology, chemicals/kits, equipments and/ or the reference value of the investigations should be uniform at all centers. 2.11.8. Efficacy evaluation(Assessment criteria) Efficacy of trial drug/therapy /procedure is to be assessed on following parameters. 1. Sign and symptoms of concerned disease 2. Laboratory parameters 3. Samyak Lakshana of therapy/procedures 2.11.9. Assessment of safety Specifications of safety parameters (both laboratory parameters and signs & symptoms) Methods/ Procedures and periodicity for assessment and analysis of safety parameters Designing a specific format for reporting and recording adverse drug events/effect or inter-current illnesses. 2.11.9.1. Adverse Reactions (ADR) / Adverse Events (AE) An unexpected ADR requires expedited review by the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC). Unexpected AE/ADRs and all SAE (serious adverse event) should be reported to the sponsor by the investigator within 24 hours and to the IEC that accorded approval to the study protocol within seven days. At the end of the trial, all adverse events whether related to trial or not are to be listed, evaluated and discussed in detail in the final report. The medical management of the adverse event is the responsibility of the investigator, and the protocol for adverse event management with allocation of responsibilities must be pre-defined in the protocol and submitted to the Institutional Ethics Committee. The Sponsor should provide ADR/AE reporting forms to the Investigator(s) / Institution(s). The Sponsor should expedite the reporting to all concerned (including the Ethics Committee and the regulatory authorities) of all serious and/or unexpected adverse drug reactions. 2.11.9.2. Serious Adverse Events Any unexpected SAE as defined in the Indian GCP (Good Clinical Practice) Guidelines occurring during a clinical trial should be communicated promptly within 14 calendar days by the Sponsor to the Licensing Authority and to the Investigator(s) of other trial sites participating in the study. The reporting of the SAE to the regulatory authority immediately is to enable it to stop the clinical trials of unapproved drugs or withdraw from market approved drugs based on report of Phase IV studies. All other serious unexpected reactions (ADRs) that are not fatal or 24 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions life threatening must be filed as soon as possible but not later than 14 calendar days. In the event of death the EC should also be informed within 24 hours. * Collection o f laboratory data should be limited to those laboratory parameters that are relevant to safety, study outcome measures, and/or clinical outcome. The toxicity tables will define what values or findings are considered abnormal. Reporting will be dependent on the abnormality, the study intervention, and the study population and should be stated specifically. Consider the context o f the trial and adjust reporting procedures appropriately fo r the study population and agent being studied. 2.12. Rescue Medication A medication intended to relieve symptoms of the investigated disease immediately. To alleviate any emergency, the use of rescue medication is permitted as per the wisdom/discretion of the Investigator. This is in contrast to preventive medications, which are taken over a long period of time to prevent or manage symptoms (for example: Use of NSAIDs for relief of severe pain in case of trial participants of Vatarakta (Gouty Arthritis) is the rescue medication in contrast to uricosuric agent such as Allopurinol, etc.). *The details o f the given rescue medication should be recorded with the details o f the name, dosage form, dose, duration, etc. in the Case Report Form. 2.13. Concomitant Medication A concomitant medication (con-med) is a drug or biological product, other than a study drug, taken by a participant during a clinical trial for any other medical condition (for example: Simultaneous use of anti-hypertensive drug in a known case of hypertension enrolled in the trial of any other disease conditions). *The details o f concomitant medications prescribed to the participants should be properly recoded with the details o f the name, dosage form, dose, duration, etc. in the Case Report Form. The participants will be instructed to avoid the use o f any other drugs on their own fo r any ailment and will be clearly instructed to consult the treating Investigator fo r any symptom or complaint, or if they feel anything unusual. 2.14. Statistical Analysis The type(s) of Statistical Analysis to be used must be clearly identified and should form basis of the statistical model for the Study. Any subsequent deviation(s) should be described and justified in the Final Report. The need and extent of an interim analysis must be specified in the Protocol. The results of the statistical analyses should be presented in a manner that is likely to facilitate1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 25 the interpretation of their clinical importance, e.g. by estimates of the magnitude of the treatment effect / difference and confidence intervals rather than sole reliance on significance testing. Missing, unused and spurious data should be accounted for during the statistical analyses. All such omissions must be documented to enable review. 2.15. Criteria for the Discontinuation of the Study (Partial Or Whole)/ Termination of study Study Discontinuation is the case where the participant develops either any serious ADR/ADE or non-compliance of the treatment regimen / termination of the study, etc. The same needs to be informed to the Sponsor and the Ethics Committee within two working days. Further, the discontinuation of a trial should be ordered if the IEC finds that the goals of the trial have already been achieved midway or unequivocal results are obtained. The study may be prematurely terminated if, in the opinion of thelnvestigator or the Sponsor or the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study termination, will be provided by the terminating party. Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants. Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements. Data that is not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable. Plans to modify, suspend or discontinue the development of the study drug. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, Sponsor will promptly inform the investigators/institutions, and the regulatory authority (ies) about the termination or suspension and the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. The Independent Review Board (IRB)/ Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) will also be informed promptly and provided the reason(s) for the termination or suspension by the sponsor or by the Investigator /Institution, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s).\" * All studies that are still analyzing data or samples (even if accrual has stopped) are submitted to the IRB/IEC fo r continuing review as per IRB policies. The IRB does not review the consent form, although under the IRB continuing review rules the consent form must be resubmitted with continuing review. 26 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 2.16. Monitoring, Auditing and Data & Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) It is mandatory that all research proposals on involving human participants should be cleared by an appropriately constituted Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC), also referred to as Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Review Board (ERB). The Ethics Committees are entrusted not only with the initial review of the proposed research protocols prior to initiation of the study but also have a continuing responsibility of regular monitoring of the approved programs to foresee the compliance of the ethics during the period of the study. Local Monitoring The Head of the Institute/Center would ensure periodic review and monitoring of the projects at Institute/Center level and the same needs to be reflected in the progress report of the institute that is being communicated to the Sponsor. Central Monitoring In case of multicentre studies a Central Monitoring Committee should be constituted to monitor the activities as and when required. *Template for Monitoring is annexed at Annexure -IV. Auditing Sponsor should perform an audit as a part of QA system. This audit should be conducted with the purpose of being independent and separate from routine monitoring or quality control functions. Audit should evaluate the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, SoPs, GCPs and applicable regulatory requirements. For the purpose of carryingout the audit - the sponsor may appoint individuals qualified by training and experienceto conduct audits. The Auditors should be independent of the parties involved in thestudy and their qualifications should be documented. The Sponsor should ensure that the auditing is conducted in accordance with the Sponsor'sSOPs on what to audit, how to audit, the frequency of audit and the form & content of audit reports. Auditors should document their observations which should be archived by the Sponsors and made available to the Regulatory Authorities when called for. Sponsor should initiate prompt action in case it is discovered that any party involved hasnot entirely complied with the GCP, SOPs, Protocol and / or any applicable regulatory requirements. If monitoring / auditing identifies serious and / or persistent noncompliance- the Sponsor should terminate the defaulting party's participation in the study and promptly notify to the regulatory authority.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 27 Data & Safety Monitoring Board The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is a board, charged with monitoring the accumulating datafrom a pharmaco-therapeutic clinical trial to detect and report early evidence of pre-specified orunanticipated benefit or harm to trial participants that may be attributable to one of the treatmentsunder evaluation. The DSMB will conduct an independent, objective review of all accumulated datafrom both blinded and unblinded clinical trials in such a manner as to maximize benefit to the trial participants and to the research effort. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) may be established to carefully monitor the data and side effects during the period of the study and put in a place where by prompt reporting of adverse event occur. The data should be reviewed at regular intervals. The Research team should report immediately to the Investigators) and Data and Safety Monitoring Board regarding any life threatening condition, whether they are pursued to be study related or not. (Please see the DSMB guidelines at Annexure-V) 3. Ethics and Safety Consideration 3.1. Ethical Principles All researches involving human participants should be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles and should respect four basic principles namely justice, respect for persons (autonomy), beneficence (to maximize benefits and to minimize harms and wrongs) and non malaficence (to do no harm) for dignity, safety, right and wellbeing of the study participants as defined in revised \" National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research Involving Human Participants \" issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research and any other laws and regulations of the country. The following principles are to be followed for conducting a research: Principles of essentiality: The principle says that after thorough consideration of all alternatives in the proposed area of research, the participation of human being for a research is considered to be essential. This should be duly vetted by an Ethics committee independent of the proposed research. Principles of voluntariness: To agree or not to agree to participate in research, or to withdraw from research at any time, the decision of the participant is supreme as per the principle. The informed consent process ensures that participants' rights are safeguarded. Principles of non-exploitation: As per this principle, the selection of the participants in aresearch and thebenefits and burdens of the research should be distributed fairly without any 28 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions discrimination irrespective of their social and economic condition or status, or literacy or educational levels. Sufficient safeguards to protect vulnerable groups should be ensured. Principle of social responsibility: The research should be planned and conducted meticulously to avoid the creation or deepening of social and historic divisions or in any way disturb social harmony in community relationships. Principles of privacy and confidentiality: The principle says the privacy of the participant, her/his identity and records are kept confidential and access is limited to only those authorized. However, under certain circumstances (suicidal ideation, homicidal tendency, HIV positive status, when required by court of law etc.) privacy of the information can be breached in consultation with the IEC for valid scientific or legal reasons as the right to life of an individual supersedes the right to privacy of the research participant. Principles of risk minimization: As per this principledue care is taken by all stakeholders (including but not limited to researchers, IECs, sponsors, regulators) at all stages of the research to ensure that the risks are minimized and appropriate care and compensation is given if any harm occurs. Principles of professional competence: The principle says that the person/Researcher involved in planning, execution, evaluation and monitoring of a research should be competent and having the appropriate and relevant qualification, experience and/or training. Principles of accountability and transparency: As per this principle, the research plan and outcomes emanating from the research should be brought into the public domain through registries, reports and scientific and other publications while safeguarding the right to privacy of the participants. Stakeholders involved in research should disclose any existing conflict of interest and manage it appropriately. The research should be conducted in a fair/,honest, impartial and transparent manner to guarantee accountability. Related records, data and notes should be retained for the required period for possible external scrutiny/ audit. Principles of the maximization of benefits: Due care should be taken to design and conduct the research in such a way that the research participants and/or the society directly or indirectly will get maximum benefits from the research. Principles of institutional arrangements: The institutions responsible for conducting the research should have policies for appropriate research governance, and take the responsibility to facilitate research by providing required infrastructure, manpower, funds and training opportunities.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 29 Principles of totality of responsibility: All stakeholders involved in research are responsible for their actions. The professional, social and moral responsibilities compliant with ethical guidelines and related regulations are binding on all stakeholders directly or indirectly. Principle of environmental protection: There searchers in compliance with existing guidelines and regulations are accountable for ensuring protection of the environment and resources at all stages of the research. 3.2. Ethics Committee The Sponsor and / or Investigator should seek the opinion of an Institutional Ethics Committee regarding suitability of the Protocol, methods and documents to be used in recruitment of Participants and obtaining their Informed Consent including adequacy of the information being provided to the Participants. The Ethics Committees are entrusted not only with the initial view of the proposed research protocols prior to initiation of the projects but also have a continuing responsibility of regular monitoring for the compliance of the Ethics of the approved programs till the same are completed. Such an ongoing review is in accordance with the \"Ethical guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human participants\" 2006, as amended from time to time by Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi. 3.2.1. Basic Responsibilities The basic responsibility of an IEC is to ensure a competent review of all ethical aspects of the project proposals received and execute the same free from any bias and influence that could affect their objectivity. The IECs should specify in writing the authority under which the committee is established, membership requirements, the terms of reference, the conditions of appointment, the offices and the quorum requirements. 3.2.2. Composition of IEC a. IEC should be multidisciplinary and multi-sectorial in composition. Independence and competence are the two hallmarks of an IEC. b. The number of persons in an Ethics Committee to be kept fairly small (5-7 members). It is generally accepted that a minimum of five persons is required to compose a quorum. There is no specific recommendation for a widely acceptable maximum number of persons but it should be kept in mind that too large a committee will make it difficult in reaching consensus opinion. 12 to 15 is the maximum recommended number c. The Chairperson of the committee should preferably be from outside the Institution and not head of the same Institution to maintain the independence of the committee. The Member 30 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions Secretary who generally belongs to the same Institution should conduct the functioning of the Committee. Other members should be a combination of medical/non-medical, scientific and non-scientific persons including lay person to reflect the differed viewpoints. The composition may be as follows:- 1. Chairperson- A technical person with research background 2. Member secretary 3. Clinicians -1-2 Ayurvedic practitioners/ clinicians from different Institutes 4. Basic medical scientists- 1-2 basic medical scientists (one pharmacologist and one preferably from Dravyaguna / Rasa shastra / Bhaishajya Kalpana). 5. Legal Expert- One Legal expert or retired Judge 6. One Social Scientist / philosopher / ethicist / theologian / representative of Non- Governmental Voluntary Agency 7. One lay person from the community The Ethics Committee at any Institution can have as its members, individuals from other Institutions or Communities if required. There should be adequate representation of age, gender, community; etc. in the Committee to safeguard the interests and welfare of all sections of the community/Society. Members should be aware of local, social and cultural norms, as this is the most important social control mechanism. If required concerned subject experts could be invited to offer their views. *In case where the IEC approval will be obtained is non AYUSH organization, two experts from Ayurveda should be kept as IEC members. 3.2.3. Terms of Reference for IECs The IEC members should be made aware of their role and responsibilities as committee members. Any change in the regulatory requirements should be brought to their attention and they should be kept abreast of all national and international developments in this regard. The Terms of References should also include a statement on Terms of Appointment with reference to the duration of the term of membership, the policy for removal, replacement and resignation procedure etc. Each committee should have its own operating procedures available with each member. The TOR for the IEC and its members should be clearly specified by the institution in the IEC SoPs (Please refer Annex VI for the List o f SoPs/ Every IEC should have written SoPs according to which the committee should function. The IEC can refer to ICMR guidelines in preparing the SoPs for all biomedical and health research and to CDSCO guidelines for drug and device trials under the purview of the1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 31 licensing authority. The SOPs should be updated periodically to reflect changing requirements. A copy of the latest version of SOPs should be made available to each member and they should be trained on the SOPs. The SOPs must be available in the secretariat of the IEC as both hard and soft copies. The scope, tenure and renewal policy of the IEC should be stated. Members of the IEC should not have any known record of misconduct. 3.2.4. Review Procedures The Ethics Committee should review every research proposal on human participants within reasonable period of time. It should ensure that a scientific evaluation has been completed before ethical review is taken up. The Committee should evaluate the possible risks to the participants with proper justification, the expected benefits and adequacy of documentation for ensuring privacy, confidentiality and justice issues. The ethical review should be done through formal meetings and should not resort to decisions through circulation of proposals. 3.2.5. Submission of Application The Investigator should submit an appropriate application to the IEC in a prescribed format along with the study protocol at least three weeks in advance. The application should include the following: Clear research objectives and rationale for undertaking the investigation in human participants in the light of existing knowledge. Recent curriculum vitae of the Investigators indicating qualification and experience. Participant recruitment procedures. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for entry of participants in the study. Precise description of methodology of the proposed research, including intended dosages and routes of administration of drugs, planned duration of treatment and details of invasive procedures if any. A description of plans to withdraw or withhold standard therapies in the course of research. The plans for statistical analysis of the study. Procedure for seeking and obtaining informed consent with sample of participant information sheet and informed consent forms in English and vernacular languages. Safety of proposed intervention and any drug to be tested, including results of relevant laboratory and animal research. 32 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions For research carrying more than minimal risk, an account of plans to provide medical therapy for such risk or injury or toxicity due to over-dosage should be included. Proposed compensation and reimbursement of incidental expenses. Storage and maintenance of all data collected during the trial. Plans for publication of results - positive or negative - while maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of the study participants. A statement on probable ethical issues and steps taken to tackle the same. All other relevant documents related to the study protocol including regulatory clearances. Agreement to comply with national and international GCP protocols for clinical trials. Details of Funding agency / Sponsors and fund allocation for the proposed work. 3.2.6. Decision Making Process The IEC should be able to provide complete and adequate review of the research proposals submitted to them (at least 1 week) to review the proposal and related documents, except in the case of expedited review. It should meet periodically at frequent intervals to review new proposals, evaluate annual progress of ongoing ones and assess final reports of all research activities involving human beings through a previously scheduled agenda, amended wherever appropriate. The decision must be taken by a broad consensus after the quorum requirements are fulfilled to recommend / reject / suggest modification for a repeat review or advice appropriate steps. The Member Secretary should communicate the decision in writing. Types of the decision bv the TEC- An IEC can give one of the following decisions: approved - with or without suggestions or comments; revision with minor modifications/amendments \u2014 approval is given after examination by the Member Secretary or expedited review, as the case may be; revision with major modifications for resubmission - this will be placed before the full committee for reconsideration for approval; or Not approved (or termination/revoking o f permission if applicable) - clearly defined reasons must be given for not approving/terminating/revoking o f permission. A member must voluntarily withdraw from the IEC while making a decision on an application which evokes a conflict of interest which should be indicated in writing to the chairperson prior to the review and should be recorded so in the minutes.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 33 If one of the members has her/his own proposal for review, then the member should not participate when the project is discussed. A negative decision should always be supported by clearly defined reasons. An IEC may decide to reverse its positive decision on a study in the event of receiving information that may adversely affect the benefit/risk ratio. The discontinuation of a trial should be ordered if the IEC finds that the goals of the trial have already been achieved midway or unequivocal results are obtained. In case of premature termination of study, notification should include the reasons for termination along with the summary of results conducted till date. The following circumstances require the matter to be brought to the attention of IEC: Any amendment to the protocol from the originally approved protocol with proper justification; Serious and unexpected adverse events and remedial steps taken to tackle them; Any new information that may influence the conduct of the study. If necessary, the Applicant/Investigator may be invited to present the protocol or offer clarifications in the meeting. Representative of the participant groups or interest groups can be invited during deliberations to offer their viewpoint. Subject Experts may be invited to offer their views, but should not take part in the decision making process. However, her/his opinion must be recorded. Meetings are to be Minutes which should be approved and signed by the Chairperson. 3.2.7. Interim Review The IEC should decide and record the special circumstances and the mechanism when an interim review can be resorted-to instead of waiting for the scheduled time of the meeting. This can be done for the following reasons: i) Re-examination of a proposal already examined by the IEC; ii) Research study of a minor nature such as examination of case records etc.; iii) An urgent proposal of national interest. 3.2.8. Record Keeping All documentation and communication of an IEC should be dated, filed and preserved according to written procedures. Confidentiality should be maintained during access and retrieval procedures by designated persons. 34 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions All active and inactive (closed) files should be appropriately labelled and archived separately in designated areas. Records can be maintained in hard copies as well as soft copies. All records must be archived for a period of at least 3 years after the completion/ termination of the study. Documents related to regulatory clinical trials must be archived for 5 years after the completion/termination of the study or as per regulations. Records may be archived for a longer period, if required by the sponsors/regulatory Bodies IEC should describe archival and retrieval mechanisms in SOPs. IEC records should be accessible for inspection by authorized representatives of regulatory agencies. 3.2.9. Special Considerations While all the above requirements are applicable to Ayurvedic Medicine research as a whole irrespective of the specialty of research, there are certain specific concerns pertaining to specialized areas of research which require additional safeguards / protection and specific considerations for the IEC to take note of. Examples of such instances are research involving children, pregnant and lactating women, vulnerable participants and those with diminished autonomy besides issues pertaining to commercialization of research and international collaboration. The observations and suggestions of IEC should be given in writing in unambiguous terms in such instances. 3.3. Informed Consent Process The information should be given to the Participants and / or their legal representatives or guardians in a language and at a level of complexity that is understandable to the Participant(s) in both written and oral form, whenever possible. The ICD has two parts - (i) patient/participant information sheet (PIS) and (ii) the informed consent form (ICF). Information on known facts about the research, which has relevance to participation, is included in the PIS. This is followed by the ICF in which the participant acknowledges that she/he has understood the information given in the PIS and is volunteering to be included in that research.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 35 3.3.1. Patient /Participant Information Sheet (PIS) Before requesting an individual's consent to participate in research, the investigator must provide the individual with the following information in the language he or she is able to understand which should not only be scientifically accurate but should also be sensitive to their social and cultural context: The aims and methods of the research; The expected duration of the participant participation; The benefits that might reasonably be expected as an outcome of research to the participant or to others; Any alternative procedures or courses of treatment that might be as advantageous to the participant as the procedure or treatment to which she/he is being subjected; Any foreseeable risk or discomfort to the participant resulting from participation in the study; The extent to which confidentiality of records could be able to safeguard, confidentiality and the anticipated consequences of breach of confidentiality; Free treatment for research related injury by the investigator / institution; Compensation of participants for disability or death resulting from such injury; Freedom of individual / family to participate and to withdraw from research any time without penalty or loss of benefits which the participant would otherwise be entitled to; The identity of the research teams and contact persons with address and phone numbers; Foreseeable extent of information on possible current and future uses of the biological material and of the data to be generated from the research and if the material is likely to be used for secondary purposes or would be shared with others, clear mention of the same; Risk of discovery of biologically sensitive information; Publication, if any, including photographs and pedigree charts. Information on standard of care (including modem medicine) The quality of the consent of certain social groups requires careful consideration as their agreement to volunteer may be unduly influenced by the Investigator. 3.3.2. Informed Consent form 3.3.2.I. Informed Consent of Participant Prior to the beginning of the Study the Investigators) must obtain the Ethics Committee's approval for the written informed consent form and all information being provided to the 36 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions Participants and / or their legal representatives or guardians or an impartial witness in case participant /Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) is illiterate. None of the oral and written information concerning the Study, including the written informed consent form, should contain any language that causes the Participant(s) or their legal representatives or guardians to waive or to appear to waive their legal rights, or that releases or appears to release the Investigator, the Institution, the Sponsor or their representatives from their liabilities for any negligence. This requirement is based on the principle that competent individuals are entitled to choose freely whether or not to participate or continue to participate in the research. Informed consent is a continuous process involving three main components - providing relevant information to potential participants, ensuring competence of the individual, ensuring the information is easily comprehended by the participants and assuring voluntariness of participation. Informed voluntary consent protects the individual's freedom of choice and respects the individual's autonomy. Requisites The participant must have the capacity to understand the proposed research, be able to make an informed decision on whether or not to be enrolled and convey her/his decision to the researcher in order to give consent. The consent should be given voluntarily and not be obtained under duress or coercion of any sort or by offering any undue inducements. In the case of an individual who is not capable of giving voluntary informed consent, the consent of LAR must be obtained. It is necessary to maintain privacy and confidentiality of participants at all stages 3.3.2.2. Informed Consent in Non-Therapeutic Study In case of a Non-Therapeutic study the consent must always be given by the participant. Non Therapeutic Studies may be conducted in participants with consent of a legal representative or guardian provided all of the following conditions are fulfilled: The objective of the study cannot be met by means of a trial in Participants) who can personally give the informed consent The foreseeable risks to the Participant(s) are low Ethics Committee's written approval is expressly sought on the inclusion of such Participant(s)1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 37 3.3.2.3. Community consent In certain populations, the community plays an important role in the consent process. Some participants may not participate in the research unless the community's consent is available. There may be situations when individual consent cannot be obtained as it will change the behaviour of the individual. In such situations community consent is required. When permission is obtained from an organization that represents the community, the quorum required for such a committee must be met. For example, in a village panchayat the number of members ordinarily required to conduct a meeting must be present while giving consent. Individual consent is important and required even if the community gives permission. 3.3.2.4. Documentation of Informed Consent process Each prospective participant should sign the informed consent form after going through the informed consent process of receiving information, understanding it and voluntarily agreeing to participate in the research. In case the participant is incompetent (medically or legally) to give consent, the LAR's consent must be documented. The process of consent for an illiterate participant/LAR should be witnessed by an impartial literate witness who is not a relative of the participant and is in no way connected to the conduct of research, such as other patients in the ward who are not in the study, staff from the social service department and counsellors. The witness should be a literate person who can read the participant information sheet and consent form and understand the language of the participant. If the participant cannot sign then a thumb impression must be obtained. The researcher who administers the consent must also sign and date the consent form. In the case of institutionalized individuals, in addition to individual/LAR consent, permission for conducting the research should be obtained from the head of that institution. In some types of research, the partner/spouse may be required to give additional consent. In genetic research, other member of a family may become involved as secondary participants if their details are recorded as a part of the family history. If information about the secondary participants is identifiable then their informed consent will also be required. Online consent may be obtained, for example, in research involving sensitive data such as unsafe sex, high risk behaviour, use of contraceptives (condoms, oral pills), or emergency 38 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions contraceptive pills among unmarried females in India etc. Investigators must ensure that privacy of the participant and confidentiality of related data is maintained. 3.3.2.5. Procedures after the consent process After consent is obtained, the participant should be given a copy of the PIS and signed ICF unless the participant is unwilling to take these documents. Such reluctance should be recorded. The researcher has an obligation to convey details of how confidentiality will be maintained to the participant. The original PIS and ICF should be archived as per the requirements given in the guidelines and regulations. 3.4. Waiver of consent The researcher can apply to the IEC for a waiver of consent if the research involves less than minimal risk to participants and the waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants. Conditions for granting waiver of consent The IEC may grant consent waiver in the following situations: research cannot practically be carried out without the waiver and the waiver is scientifically justified; retrospective studies, where the participants are de-identified or cannot be contacted; research on anonymized biological samples/data; certain types of public health studies/surveillance programmes/programme evaluation studies; research on data available in the public domain; or research during humanitarian emergencies and disasters, when the participant may not be in a position to give consent. Attempt should be made to obtain the participant's consent at the earliest. 3.5. Responsibilities of the Researcher The researcher should only use the IEC approved version of the consent form, including its local translations. Adequate information necessary for informed consent should be communicated in a language and manner easily understood by prospective participants.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 39 In case of differently abled participants, such as individuals with physical, neurologicalor mental disabilities, appropriate methods should be used to enhance the participants'understanding, for example, braille for the visually impaired. There should be no restriction on the participant's right to ask questions related to the study or to discuss with family and friends or take time before coming to a decision. The researcher should not give any unjustifiable assurances or influence or intimidatea prospective participant to enroll in the study. The researcher must ensure that the participant is competent and has understood all aspects of the study and that the consent is given voluntarily. Where the participant and/or the LAR are illiterate, an impartial literate person, not connected to the research, should be present throughout the consent process as witness. The researcher should administer a test of understanding whenever possible for sensitive studies. If need be, the test may be repeated until the participant has really understood the contents. When a participant is willing to participate but not willing to sign or give a thumb impression or cannot do so, then verbal/oral consent may be taken on approval by the IEC, in the presence of an impartial witness who should sign and date the consen document. This process can be documented through audio or video recording of the participant, the PI and the impartial witness, all of whom should be seen in the frame.However, verbal/oral consent should only be taken in exceptional circumstances andfor specific, justifiable reasons with the approval of the IEC. It should not to be practiced routinely. The researcher must assure prospective participants that their decision whether or notto participate in the research will not affect their rights, the patient-clinician relations hipor any other benefits to which they are entitled. Reimbursement may be given for travel and incidental expenses/participation in research after approval by the IEC . The researcher should ensure free treatment for research related injury (disability,chronic life-threatening disease and congenital anomaly or birth defect) and if required, payment o compensation over and above medical management by the investigator and/institution and sponsor(s), as the case may be. The researcher should ensure that the participant can continue to access routine care even in the event of withdrawal of the participant. 40 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 3.6. Responsibilities of the Institution for conducting a research in alliance with industries/commercial companies Academic institutions conducting research in alliance with industries/commercial companies require a strong review to probe possible conflicts of interest between scientific responsibilities of Investigators and business interests (e.g. ownership or part ownership of a company developing a new product). In cases where the review board/committee determines that a conflict of interest may damage the scientific integrity of a study or cause harm to research participants, the board should advise accordingly. Institutions need self-regulatory processes to monitor, prevent and resolve such conflicts of interest. Prospective participants in research should also be informed of the sponsorship of research, so that they can be aware of the potential for conflicts of interest and commercial aspects of the research. Undue inducement through compensation for individual participants, families and populations should be prohibited. This prohibition however, does not include agreements with individuals, families, groups, communities or populations that foresee technology transfer, local training, joint ventures, provision of health care reimbursement, costs of travel and loss of wages and the possible use of a percentage of any royalties for humanitarian purposes. 3.7. Selection of Vulnerable groups as Research Participant The word vulnerability is derived from the Latin word vulnarere which means 'to wound'. Vulnerable persons are those individuals who are relatively or absolutely incapable of protecting their own interests because of personal disability; environmental burdens; social injustice; lack of power, understanding or ability to communicate or are in a situation that prevents them from doing so. Vulnerable populations have an equal right to be included in research so that benefits accruing from the research apply to them as well. These vulnerable persons have some common characteristics which are listed below- socially, economically or politically disadvantaged and therefore susceptible to being exploited; incapable of making a voluntary informed decision for themselves or whose autonomy is compromised temporarily or permanently, for example people who are unconscious, differently abled; able to give consent, but whose voluntariness or understanding is compromised due to their situational conditions; or unduly influenced either by the expectation of benefits or fear of retaliation in case of refusal to participate which may lead them to give consent.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 41 Following are some examples of vulnerable populations or groups: economically and socially disadvantaged (unemployed individuals, orphans, abandoned individuals, persons below the poverty line, ethnic minorities, sexual minorities - lesbian/ gay/bisexual and transgender (LGBT), etc.); unduly influenced either by the expectation of benefits or fear of retaliation in case of refusal to participate which may lead them to give consent; children (up to 18 years); women in special situations (pregnant or lactating women, or those who have poor decision\u00ad making powers/poor access to healthcare); tribals and marginalized communities; refugees, migrants, homeless, persons or populations in conflict zones, riot areas or disaster situations; afflicted with mental illness and cognitively impaired individuals, differently abled - mentally and physically disabled; terminally ill or are in search of new interventions having exhausted all therapies; suffering from stigmatizing or rare diseases; or have diminished autonomy due to dependency or being under a hierarchical system (students, employees, subordinates, defence services personnel, healthcare workers, institutionalized individuals, under trials and prisoners). 3.7.1. Pregnant or nursing women Pregnant or nursing women should in no circumstances be the participant of any research unless the research carries no more than minimal risk to the fetus or nursing infant and the object of the research is to obtain new knowledge about the foetus, pregnancy and lactation. As a general rule, pregnant or nursing women should not be participants of any clinical trial except such trials as are designed to protect or advance the health of pregnant or nursing women or foetuses or nursing infants, and for which women who are not pregnant or nursing would not be suitable participants. The justification of participation of these women in clinical trials would be that they should not be deprived arbitrarily of the opportunity to benefit from investigations, drugs, vaccines or other agents that promise therapeutic or preventive benefits. Example of such trials are- a. Test the efficacy and safety of a drug for reducing peri-natal transmission of HIV infection from mother to child 42 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions The trials for detecting fetal abnormalities and for conditions associated with or aggravated by pregnancy, etc. Women should not be encouraged to discontinue nursing for the sake of participation in research and in case she decides to do so, harm of cessation of breast feeding to the nursing child should be properly assessed except in those studies where breast feeding is harmful to the infant. b. Research related to termination of pregnancy Pregnant women who desire to undergo Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) could be made participants for such research as per the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, Government of India, 1971. c. Research related to pre-natal diagnostic techniques In pregnant women such research should be limited to detect the foetal abnormalities or genetic disorders as per the Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, GOI, 1994 and not for sex determination of the foetus. 3.7.2. Children Before undertaking trial in children below the age of 18 years the Investigator must ensure that - a. Children will not be involved in research that could be carried out equally well with adults; b. The purpose of the research is to obtain knowledge relevant to health needs of children. For clinical evaluation of a new Ayurvedic drug / Patent or Proprietary Medicines the study in children should always be carried out after the phase III clinical trials in adults. It can be studied earlier only if the Ayurvedic drug / Patent or Proprietary Medicines have a therapeutic value in a primary disease of the children; c. A parent or legal guardian of each child has given proxy consent; d. The Assent of the child should be obtained to the extent of the child's capabilities such as in the case of mature minors, adolescents etc. Considerations for assent There is no need to document assent for children below 7 years of age. For children between 7 and 12 years, verbal/oral assent must be obtained in the presence of the parents/LAR and should be recorded. For children between 12 and 18 years, written assent must be obtained. This assent form also has to be signed by the parents/LAR. Adolescents may have the capacity to give consent like adults. However, as they have not attained the legal age to provide consent, it is termed as assent and the consent of the parents/LAR should be obtained. If the latter will affect the validity of the study,1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 43 waiver of consent from the relevant adult should be taken and recorded with the approval of the IEC, for example, in behavioural studies in IV drug users where parental consent may not be possible. e. Research should be conducted in settings in which the child and parent can obtain adequate medical and psychological support; f. Interventions intended to provide direct diagnostic, therapeutic or preventive benefit for the individual child participant must be justified in relation to anticipated risks involved in the study and anticipated benefits to society; g. The child's refusal to participate in research must always be respected unless there is no medically acceptable alternative to the therapy provided/tested. The consent has to be obtained from parents/guardian; h. Interventions that are intended to provide therapeutic benefit are likely to be at least as advantageous to the individual child participant as any available alternative interventions; i. The risk presented by interventions not intended to benefit the individual child participant is low when compared to the importance of the knowledge that is to be gained. 4. Registration of clinical trial Clinical trials hold enormous potential for benefiting participants, improving therapeutic regimens and ensuring advancement in medical practice that is evidence based. Registration of trials will ensure transparency, accountability and accessibility of clinical trials. The Clinical Trials Registry- India (CTRI) hosted at the ICMR's National Institute of Medical Statistics (NIMS), is a free and online (www.ctri.nic.in) public record system for registration of clinical trials being conducted in India Today, any Investigator who plans to conduct a trial involving human participants of any intervention such as drugs, surgical procedures, preventive measures, lifestyle modifications, devices, educational or behavioral treatment, rehabilitation strategies as well as trials being conducted in the purview of the Ministry of AYUSH (http://indianmedicine.nic.in/) is expected to register the trial in the CTRI before enrollment of the first participant. Trial registration involves public declaration and identification of trial Investigators, Sponsors, Interventions, Participant population, Trial site, etc. before the enrollment of the first participant. Submission of Ethics approval and Ministry of AYUSH approval (if applicable) is essential for trial registration in the CTRI. Multi-country trials, where India is a participating country, which have been registered in an international registry, are also expected to be registered in the CTRI. 44 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions In the CTRI, details of Indian investigators, trial sites, Indian target sample size and date of enrollment are captured. After a trial is registered, investigators are expected to regularly update the trial status or other aspects as the case may be. After a trial is registered, all updates and changes will be recorded and available for public display. Being a Primary Register of the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/), registered trials are freely searchable both from the WHO's search portal, the ICTRP as well as from the CTRI (www.ctri.nic.in). 5. Record Keeping and Data Handling The basic concept of record-keeping and handling of data is to record, store, transfer, and where necessary convert efficiently and accurately the information collected on the trial participant(s) into data that can be used to compile the Study Report. 5.1. Documentation All steps involved in data management should be documented in order to allow step-by step retrospective assessment of data quality and study performance for the purpose of audit following the SoPs facilitates documentation. Documentation of SoPs should include details of checklists and forms giving details of actions taken, dates and the individuals responsible, etc. 5.2. Corrections All corrections in the CRFs or any other study related documents should be made in a way that does not obscure the original entry. The correct data should be inserted with the reason for the correction if such a reason is not obvious. The corrections should carry the date and initials of the Investigator or the authorized person. 5.3. Electronic Data Processing For electronic data processing only authorized person should be allowed to enter or modify the data in the computer and there should be a recorded trail of the changes and deletions made. A security system should be set-up to prevent un-authorized access to the data. If data is altered during processing the alteration must be documented and the system should be validated. The systems should be designed to permit data changes in such a way that the data changes are documented and there is no deletion of data once it has been entered. A list of authorized persons who can make changes in the computer system should be maintained. Adequate backup of the data should be maintained.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 45 5.4. Validation of Electronic Data Processing Systems If trial data are entered directly into the computer there must always be an adequate safeguard to ensure validation including a signed and dated printout and backup records. Computerized systems - hardware as well as software - should be validated and a detailed description of their use be produced and kept up-to-date. 5.5. Language All written documents, information and other material used in the Study should be in a language that is clearly understood by all concerned (i.e. the Participants, paramedical staff, Monitors etc.) 5.6. Responsibilities of the Investigator Investigator should ensure that the observations and findings are recorded correctly and completely in the CRFs and signed by the responsible person(s) designated in the Protocol. Laboratory values with normal reference ranges should always be recorded on a CRF or enclosed with the CRF. Values outside the clinically accepted reference range or values that differ importantly from previous values must be evaluated and commented upon by the Investigator. Data other than that requested by the Protocol may appear on the CRF clearly marked as the additional findings and their significance described by the investigator. Units of measurement must always be stated and transformation of units must always be indicated and documented. In the medical records of the participant(s) it should be clearly indicated that the individual is participating in a clinical trial. The immediate transport facility should be provided to the study personnel to nearby hospital for medical referral. 5.7. Responsibilities of the Sponsor and the Monitor The sponsor must ensure that electronic data processing system conforms to the certain documented requirements for completeness, accuracy, reliability and consistent intended performance (i.e. validation). The Sponsor must maintain SoPs for using these systems. The Monitor should take adequate measures to ensure that no data is overlooked. If the computer system automatically assigns any missing values - the fact should be clearly documented. Sponsor should safeguard the blinding, if any, particularly during data entry and processing. The Sponsor should use an explicit Participant identification code that allows identification of all the data reported for each Participant. Ownership of the data and any transfer of the ownership of data should be documented and intimated to the concerned party (ies). 46 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 6. Publication Policy A publication policy, if not addressed in a separate agreement, should be described in theprotocol. 7. Common Problems in Research Protocols Some of the common mistakes are: Inadequate literature review or conducting a quick survey when a systematic review is needed. Vague research question, this means the question is too broad or unanswerable, and needs to be focused. Flawed research design: Do not select a study type that will not answer the question. Much time and effort will be wasted. Most research failures can be traced to the early planning stages. A project is too ambitious than the research skills of Investigator or the institutional resources is not sufficient in the institution responsible for. Too many research questions: lacks focus and not achievable in time Inadequate number of participants to answer the question: Do not count on the IEC to alert the researcher about this problem, which poses no risk to participants, even though it wastes the time of willing volunteers. Inappropriate plan for statistical analysis: The statistician is planning to use the wrong tests to look at the data. Poorly written consent form: The IEC will send the consent form back for rewriting if not comprehensive and legally sound. A budget inadequate for the project, or even too high. Failure to reach consensus on all aspects of the protocol. 8. Final steps After the Research Protocol is written (and re written a few times), it should be reviewed by a \"Critical Reader\" may be colleague or peer. This will help to identify the problems with organization or in the grammar that may detract from the merits of the idea. If the \"critical- reader\" colleague is not research-sawy, especially in your area of investigation, it may be reviewed by an experienced investigator.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions 47 I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l 9.

For eg., Ia is considered to be highest level of evidence. Level Type of evidence Ia Evidence obtained from meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials lb Evidence obtained from at least one randomized controlled trial Ha Evidence obtained from at least one well-designed controlled study without randomization lib Evidence obtained from at least one other type of well-designed quasi-experimental study III Evidence obtained from well-designed non-experimental descriptive studies, such as comparative studies, correlation studies and case control studies IV Evidence obtained from expert committee reports or opinions and/or clinical experience of respected authorities Grading of recommendations: available criteria for recommendation of AYUSH intervention based on the level of evidences is given below. For e.g., availability of requirements as listed in Grade A gives a highest recommendation for the use of AYUH intervention. Grade Recommendation A (Evidence levels quality Ia, lb) Requires at least one randomized controlled trial as part of the body of literature of overall good and consistency addressing the specific recommendation. B (Evidence levels Ha, lib, III) Requires availability of well-conducted clinical studies but no randomized clinical trials on the topic of recommendation. C (Evidence level IV) Requires evidence from expert committee reports or opinions and/or clinical experience of respected authorities. Indicates absence of directly applicable studies of good quality.

Roles and Responsibilities The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is an independent group of experts that advises NIDCR and the study investigators. The members of the DSMB serve in an individual capacity and provide their expertise and recommendations. The primary responsibilities of the DSMB are to 1) periodically review and evaluate the accumulated study data for participant safety, study conduct and progress, and, when appropriate, efficacy, and 2) make recommendations to NIDCR concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the trial. The DSMB considers study-specific data as well as relevant background knowledge about the disease, test agent, or patient population under study. The DSMB is responsible for defining its deliberative processes, including event triggers that would call for an unscheduled review, stopping guidelines, unmasking (unblinding) and voting procedures prior to initiating any data review. The DSMB is also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of its internal discussions and activities as well as the contents of reports provided to it. The DSMB should review each protocol for any major concern prior to implementation. During the trial, the DSMB should review cumulative study data to evaluate safety, study conduct, and scientific validity and integrity of the trial. As part of this responsibility, DSMB members must be satisfied that the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of the data submitted to them for review are sufficient for evaluation of the safety and welfare of study participants. The DSMB should also assess the performance of overall study operations and any other relevant issues, as necessary. Items reviewed by the DSMB include: Interim/cumulative data for evidence of study-related adverse events; Interim/cumulative data for evidence of efficacy according to pre-established statistical guidelines, if appropriate; Data quality, completeness, and timeliness; Performance of individual centers; Adequacy of compliance with goals for recruitment and retention, including those related to theparticipation of women and minorities; Adherence to the protocol; Factors that might affect the study outcome or compromise the confidentiality of the trial data (such asprotocol violations, unmasking, etc.); and, Factors external to the study such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may impact participantsafety or the ethics of the study. The DSMB should conclude each review with their recommendations to NIDCR as to whether the study should continue without change, be modified, or terminated. Recommendations regarding modification of the design and conduct of the study could include: Modifications of the study protocol based upon the review of the safety data; Suspension or early termination of the study or of one or more study arms because of serious concemsabout subjects' safety, inadequate performance or rate of enrollment; Suspension or early termination of the study or of one or more study arms because study objectiveshave been obtained according to pre-established statistical guidelines; Optional approaches for NIDCR and investigators to consider when the DSMB determines that the incidence of primary study outcomes is substantially less than 6 8 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l expected such as recommendations toincrease the number of trial centers or extend the recruitment period; and, Corrective actions regarding a study center whose performance appears unsatisfactory or suspicious. Confidentiality must always be maintained during all phases of DSMB review and deliberations. Usually, only voting members of the DSMB should have access to interim analyses of outcome data by treatment group. Exceptions may be made when the DSMB deems it appropriate. The reason and to whom the exceptions for access to interim analyses is granted will be documented in the Closed Session Report. DSMB members must maintain strict confidentiality concerning all privileged trial results ever provided to them. The DSMB should review data only by masked study group (such as X vs. Y rather than experimental vs. control) unless or until the DSMB determines that the identities of the groups are necessary for their decision-making. Whenever masked data are presented to the DSMB, the key to the group coding must be available for immediate unmasking. II. Membership The membership of the DSMB should reflect the disciplines and medical and dental specialties necessary to interpret the data from the clinical trial and to fully evaluate participant safety. The number of DSMB members depends on the phase of the trial, range of medical issues, complexity in design and analysis, and potential level of risk but generally consists of three to seven members including, at a minimum: Expert(s) in the clinical aspects of the disease/patient population being studied; One or more biostatisticians; and, Investigators with expertise in current clinical trials conduct and methodology. Ad hoc specialists may be invited to participate as non-voting members at any time if additional expertise is desired. Some trials, depending on the population and nature of the intervention, may well be served by inclusion of a bioethicist on the DSMB, Steering Committee, or Advisory Panel. NIDCR staff without direct involvement in study implementation and who meet other membership criteria may participate as ex officio, non-voting members. NIDCR staff serving in these positions must have a current confidential financial disclosure report on file with the Deputy Ethics Counselor, NIDCR. Representatives of the manufacturer (industrial collaborator) of the test substance(s) or any other individual with vested interests in the outcome of the study are not eligible to serve on the DSMB although they may attend open sessions of the DSMB meetings. Conflict o f Interest No member of the D SMB should have direct involvement in the conduct of the study. Furthermore, no member should have financial, proprietary, professional, or other interests that may affect impartial, independent decision-making by the DSMB. Letters of invitation to prospective DSMB and ad hoc members should include the following: \"Acceptance of this invitation to serve on the xxx DSMB confirms that I do not have any financial or other interest with any of the collaborating or competing pharmaceutical firms or other organizations involved in the study that constitute a potential conflict of interest.\" In addition, all DSMB and ad hoc members will sign a Conflict of Interest certification to that effect at the time they are asked to participate . At the beginning of every DSMB meeting, NIDCR program staff or the DSMB Chair will reconfirm that no conflict of interest exists for DSMB members. Interests that may create a potential conflict of interest should be disclosed to the DSMB prior to any discussion. The DSMB will determine how to handle such potential conflict. The DSMB can require that a member with a potential conflict not vote or take other means deemed appropriate.

Selection and Invitation to Participate The Program Official (PO) holds prima ry responsibility for the formation of the DSMB unless the Clinical Terms of Award for a grant or the Roles and Responsibilities negotiated for a protocol specifically identify this as the responsibility of the grantee. The PO (or grantee as specified) is responsible for developing the roster of potential DSMB members. Recommendations for proposed members are solicited from many sources. Study investigators and the industrial collaborators should have the opportunity to review the list of proposed members before the candidate's interest and availability are confirmed by the PO (or grantee as specified). The proposed roster of members must be submitted to the Director, Office of Clinical Trials. When is a DSMB Needed? A DSMB is indicated, from a practical perspective in the following circumstances: If the trial is intended to provide definitive information about effectiveness and/or safety of a medical or biobehavioral intervention If there are prior data to suggest that the intervention being studied has the potential to induce potentially unacceptable toxicity If the trial is evaluating mortality or another major endpoint, such that inferiority of one treatment arm has safety as well as effectiveness implications If it would ethically be important for the trial to stop early if the primary question addressed has been definitively answered, even if secondary questions or complete safety information were not yet fully addressed. It is generally expected that a DSMB will be utilized in the following situations: All Phase III studies require a DSMB, with the exception of low-risk behavioral and nutritional studies. o For this discussion, \"low-risk\" refers to trials where subjects are expected to experience only minor sideeffects, and interim analyses are not crucial for the protection of the subjects o The involvement of a DSMB may still be requested for low-risk studies if the studies are exceptionally large,long term, and/or involve vulnerable subjects Phase II clinical trials which are multicenter and randomized require a DSMB, with the exception of low-riskbehavioral and nutritional studies Phase II studies which are \"high risk\" require a DSMB o For this discussion, \"high-risk\" refers to trials of interventions associated with substantial side effects tosubjects (e.g., side effects that could result in serious morbidity or death, or are irreversible), trials ofdiseases associated with high mortality or morbidity, and trials of highly experimental therapies (e.g., genetherapy) o As a general guideline, DSMBs are needed for clinical trials of diseases with high mortality or morbidity, forclinical trials involving high risks, and for large, multicenter clinical trials For some studies involving particularly vulnerable study participants (e.g., children or persons with impairedability to consent), it may be beneficially to utilize a DSMB as an additional measure of subject protection A DSMB is NOT generally expected in the following situations: 70 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions Ill I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I Single-center open-label Phase I and II clinical trials generally do not need a DSMB since the local investigatorwill have access to all data. In these types of trials, the investigator could appoint an independent medicalmonitor to evaluate adverse events and make recommendations for continuing or stopping a trial A multicenter, high-risk Phase I clinical trial should not require a DSMB if there are very clear rules for stoppingthe trial. For example, a DSMB is generally not required for a classic open-label dose escalation trial with clearand objective criteria for halting the dose escalation when unacceptable side effects are observed.A DSMB is likely to be requested if the DSMP lacks objective criteria for continuing or halting the trial A DSMB may not be feasible for clinical trials that are expected to accrue too quickly to allow for a DSMB to be constituted and complete data and safety monitoring NIH or other Federal Grants If you are considering utilizing the NC TraCS DSMB to monitor a clinical trial included in an NIH or federal grant,please submit a copy of your grant to the DSMB for review in advance of submitting the grant to the agency.The DSMB prefers to review research proposals prior to submission to a funding agency in order to determinewhether the NC TraCS DSMB is the appropriate body to monitor the study The NC TraCS DSMB will provide guidance to the investigator regarding study stopping rules, appropriate studydesign, and the safety monitoring plan. If the TraCS DSMB agrees to provide oversight for the clinical trial, aletter of support will be written that describes the DSMB and their role in monitoring the study A copy of the NC TraCS DSMB Charter to be included with the grant application will be provided upon request.

Audio Visual Recording of the Informed Consent Process 72 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions ANNEXURE-VII ESSENTIAL DOCUMENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF A CLINICAL TRIAL Introduction Essential Documents are those documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data produced. These documents serve to demonstrate the compliance of the investigator, sponsor, and monitor with the standards of GCP and with all applicable regulatory requirements. Essential Documents also serve a number of other important purposes. Filing essential documents at the investigator/institution and sponsor sites in a timely manner can greatly assist in the successful management of a trial by the investigator, sponsor, and monitor. These documents are also the ones that are usually audited by the sponsor's independent audit function and inspected by the regulatory authority(ies) as part of the process to confirm the validity of the trial conduct and the integrity of data collected. The minimum list of essential documents that has been developed follows. The various documents are grouped in three sections according to the stage of the trial during which they will normally be generated (1) before the clinical phase of the trial commences, (2) during the clinical conduct of the trial, and (3) after completion or termination of the trial. A description is given of the purpose of each document, and whether it should be filed in either the investigator/institution or sponsor files, or both. It is acceptable to combine some of the documents, provided the individual elements are readily identifiable. Trial master files should be established at the beginning of the trial, both at the investigator/institution's site and at the sponsor's office. A final close-out of a trial can only be done when the monitor has reviewed both investigator/institution and sponsor files and confirmed that all necessary documents are in the appropriate files. Any or all of the documents addressed in this guidance may be subject to, and should be available for, audit by the sponsor's auditor and inspection by the regulatory authority(ies). A. Before the Clinical Phase of the Trial Commences During this planning stage the following documents should be generated and should be on file before the trial formally starts.1 IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I I IN I I IN I I III I IN I SI.

In this way, the investigator can be provided with the most informative interpretation of the available data and with an assessment of the implications of the information for future clinical trials. Where appropriate, the published reports on related products should be discussed. This could help the investigator to anticipate adverse drug reactions or other problems in clinical trials. The overall aim of this section is to provide the investigator with a clear understanding of the possible risks and adverse reactions, and of the specific tests, observations, and precautions that may be needed for a clinical trial. This understanding should be based on the available physical, chemical, pharmaceutical, pharmacological, toxicological, and clinical information on the investigational product(s). Guidance should also be provided to the clinical investigator on the recognition and treatment of possible overdose and adverse drug reactions that are based on previous human experience and on the pharmacology of the investigational product.

It should be mentioned with the duration. Associated complaints ( 3 I < H 4 < T 4 J C I 4 < H I ) Groups of related symptoms provide diagnostic clues about pathologic processes and involved description provides the framework for characterizing the course of an illness. The physician should obtain a chronological report by asking when the problem first started and facilitate a continuing flow of information with questions such as \"And then what happened? ... and then? Bodily location', for pain /skin lesions/ Swelling etc. The bodily location of pain or other discomfort should be defined as accurately as possible..Patient may have more than one pain and that multiple pains may indicate multiple disease processes. Ask the patient to characterize and differentiate each. Character: In patients own words for pain/ itching/cough/skin lesions/ discharges etc.Most patients use analogies to describe the quality of a sensation. Spread/ radiation : The patient may be encouraged to indicate the location and spread of symptom using hand gestures, which also indicate how large an area is involved Severity : The severity can be measured by the quantity or intensity of the symptom.The intensity of pain can be estimated on a scale of 1 to 10 or compared to another pain the patient has experienced. Other examples of quantity include volume (for example, the quantity of sputum expectorated in a day), number (for example, the number of times the patient has lost consciousness), and the degree of impairment the patient suffers. Impairment or disability is best characterized in terms of the patient's usual daily activities, such as breathlessness with climbing stairs at home or chest pain while sweeping the floor. The patient's exact words are important.\" Try to use the patient's own vocabulary if possible. Also can assess whether the daily routine/ Sleep/ job/ family life/ Social life (for mental disorders) etc are affected. Eg: Khalli is a similar disease as viswachi and gridhrasi but with a greater severity.

An analysis of the previoustreatment responses of the patients gives important cluesregarding the personal featuresof the patient such as prakriti etc and state of the disease. Personal History (cl'Ufadctxjdkrl:) It includes the daily activities of an individual which should be recorded in detail to rule out the the various faulty life styles as the nidana of the disease and to know how far the individual is deviated from healthy life style. In ayurveda , faulty life style and dietetics (mithya ahar vihar) 84 General Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Ayurvedic Interventions are important etiological factors for most of the diseases and theindividual can be interrogated for their daily activities in a sequence they are to be observed/ pracitised daily.

For example getting up late in the morning around 8pm ie Sleshma kala would not facilitate the routine malapravritti which is a function of vata that can easily happen in vata kala before 6 am. Sukhena pratibodhanam ie easy waking up is a charachterstics of a healthy individual. If it does not happen , it may indicate the disease condition in the patient.

It cause itching and skin diseases. Hot water is advised for body bath and if done with cold water it can result in vata/ kapha vridhi especially in vata/kapha prakriti individuals and patients with vata vyadhi.
