Insulin Everyone with [type 1 diabetes](/type-1-diabetes), and some people with [type 2 diabetes,](/type-2-diabetes) need to take [insulin](/guide-to-diabetes/managing-your-diabetes/treating-your-diabetes/insulin) to manage their blood glucose (sugar) levels. If you have type 2 diabetes and your healthcare team recommends that you need to start insulin, it doesn't mean that you now have type 1 diabetes. You still have type 2, but your treatment has changed. Many people with type 2 need insulin treatment at some point and it doesn't mean you haven't managed your diabetes well. Insulin is simply another medication that can help to keep you as healthy as possible. Managing blood sugars effectively is really important in reducing your risk of future diabetes complications and insulin may be the most appropriate treatment choice for you.

Insulin If you have type 2 diabetes, you may not need to use insulin straight away. But some people have very high blood sugar levels when they are first diagnosed. Insulin can be used as a short-term treatment to help quickly bring down your blood sugar levels. Some people may need to take insulin for a particular reason, like during pregnancy, a severe illness, or after surgery. But you may also need to start insulin as a treatment if other medications haven't helped managed your blood sugar levels or aren't appropriate for you. Many people with type 2 diabetes need to use insulin as treatment at some point. If you need to start insulin treatment, remember that this isn't your fault. It's still important to keep going to your appointments and manage your condition with healthy lifestyle choices. Staying active and eating a healthy diet will reduce the risk of complications from your diabetes. When you start taking insulin, you may notice that you start to put on weight. There are lots of reasons for this, like how much insulin you take, your diet and the type of insulin you're taking.
