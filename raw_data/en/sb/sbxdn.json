CEP focuses on the relationship between thoughts, emotions, sensations, behaviors, and known bioenergy systems (such as meridians and the biofield). These systems and processes exist and interact within individuals and between people. They also are influenced by cultural and environmental factors. [Watch our video explaining Comprehensive Energy Psychology](/services/energy-psychology/#watch). Within a Comprehensive Energy Psychology framework, emotional and physical issues are seen and treated as bio-energetic patterns within a mind-body-energy system. The mind and body are thought to be interwoven and interactive within this mind-body-energy system. CEP applications incorporate natural energetic components into the treatment process that include, but are not limited to, meridians, chakras, biofields, and bio-electrical and electromagnetic activity of the body, the nervous system, and the heart. In therapy, Comprehensive Energy Psychology can help assess and treat trauma, anxiety, depression, pain, stress, psychophysiological issues, and self-sabotaging behaviors. CEP can have rapid and long-lasting results with little to no adverse effects, making our clients feel self-empowered. Although CEP is viewed as a relatively young approach, the evidence supporting it continues to develop. According to the [Association for Comprehensive Energy Psychology](https://www.energypsych.org), \"As of August 2021, 70 randomized control trials, over 55 pre-post outcome studies, 5 meta-analyses, and 17 systematic reviews have been published on CEP methods in English-speaking, peer-reviewed journals. In addition, over 80 research studies have been published in non-English journals. More than 200 investigators have researched these modalities in over 12 countries.\" More than 400 forms of psychotherapy have been identified, most of which have little or no research to validate them. Comprehensive Energy Psychology is both evidence-based and in the top 10% in terms of research for psychotherapy modalities. OptimalLife Wellness is excited and pleased to be able to offer this innovative and user-friendly mind body therapy approach to both our English and Spanish-speaking clients. "}
