Elections -Poll Workers ~ Support legislation that will assist in providing adequate staffing at polling places, including designation of public employees as Election Service Workers. 11. Telecommunications Act Rewrite ~ Support rewriting provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, to include protecting existing authorities and revenues. 12. Veteran's SelVices \u00bb Support funding to assist veterans and their dependents and/or survivors with job training and placement, mental and physical health care, educational opportunities, housing, benefits and other quality of life services. 3 Legislative Proposa Is 4 Legislative Proposals 12012 The following are legislative proposals for which Alameda County seeks sponsorship during the 2012 legislative session. Additional proposals may be developed throughout the year. 1. Occupational licensing Boards Alameda County supports a model program at Camp Sweeney, Bay EMT. This program allows juveniles at Camp Sweeney to be trained as Emergency Medical Technicians while they are in custody. While we are very proud of this partnership and youth who graduate from this program, we have found that many of the youth are unable to be licensed as EMTs due to their records of delinquency. Upon further research, we have found that many participants in incarceration based technical and vocational training programs face the same barriers. These barriers also exist for formerly incarcerated individuals that pursue education and training as part of their re-entry program. Supervisor Carson's office proposes that the County seek sponsorship of legislation during the 2012 legislative session to that addresse sthese barriers. 2. Safe Needle Disposal While in previous legislative sessions, Alameda County has successfully sponsored five pieces of safe needle disposal legislation; current law does not regulate the mass generators of these needles: the pharmaceutical industry. Every year more than 2 billion needles and syringes are used nationwide outside of health care settings (i.e. at home). These \"at-home\" injectors are people with diabetes and patients receiving home health treatment for allergies, infertility, multiple sclerosis, HIV, Hepatitis 8 & C, arthritis, etc. An estimated one million Californians must self-inject prescription medications annually to treat a broad range of serious health problems. It is estimated that 1 million Californians generate more than 389 million sharps per year. Many of these self-injectors are unaware of safe disposal methods avaifable to them and simply throw their used needles in the trash posing a risk of injury and potential infection from diseases such as Hepatitis B or C and HIV to children, workers, and the general public. Due to recent legislative efforts, throwing these needles in the trash is now illegal. However, better disposal methods are necessary for persons who must use needles at home. The use of needles is an effective method of prescription drug delivery and is expected to increase significantly in the future. The increased use of sharps, however, will generate more risk of infection to the general public each year absent a solution. Supervisor Carson's office proposes that the County seek sponsorship of legislation during the 2012 legislative session that amends the Health & Safety Code so that pharmaceutical manufacturers whose product is dispensed in California via any injection device be responsible for providing their patients with safe needle disposal methods. 3. Allow the State of California to eliminate the signature requirement for the renewal of Medi-Cal. Alameda County supports making health coverage accessible and breaking down barriers that make it difficult to renew or maintain Medi-Cal coverage. Other states have secured approval from CMS for simplified redetermination procedures for Medicaid. Supervisor Chan's office supports legislative efforts that would simplify the renewal process for Medi-Cal recipients. 4. Develop an Adult Day Health Care transition/restoration plan as a result of Disability Rights Advocates settlement with the State of California. 5 Legislative Proposals 12012 Alameda County supports guaranteeing Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) services to the residents of Alameda County and is in support of any transitional framework that provides sufficient funding to ADHC Service providers. Supervisor Chan's office supports legislative efforts that would guarantee adult day health services to all eligible recipients. 5. Request the State of California adopt a resolution for the Sebelius Challenge. Secretary Sebelius issued the Connecting Kids to Coverage Challenge, calling upon leaders at all levels of government and the private sector to find and enroll the nearly five million uninsured children eligible for Medicaid and CHIP and keep them covered for as long as they qualify. The Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act provides the support needed for this work to be successful, by providing the tools to modernize and build consumer-friendly, data\u00ad driven enrollment systems, and by supporting outreach and enrollment efforts at the state and community levels. Alameda County was the first county in the nation to accept the challenge to actively recruit and enroll uninsured children eligible for publicly funded health insurance. Supervisor Chan's office supports legislative efforts that would guarantee adult day health services to all eligible recipients. 6. Require the California State Department of Health Care Services and the California State Department of Public Health to collect and tabulate data for each major Asian group. In 2011, Assembly Bill 1088 was authored by Assemblymember Mike Eng and was signed into law. AB 1088 requires the Department of Industrial Relations and the Department of Fair Employment and Housing to collect and tabulate data for each major Asian group. Senate amendments altered the bill before final passage, which deleted the State Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) and the State Department of Public Health (DPH) from the provisions of the bill. Supervisor Chan's office supports efforts to have DHCS and DPH collect and tabulate this data. 7. Require the Board of Pharmacy to standardize translation of prescription drug labels. In 2010, Senator Ellen Corbett authored Senate Bill 1390 and the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network sponsored the bill. SB 1390 attempted to repeal the requirement that the Board of Pharmacy (BOP) promulgate regulations requiring a standardized, patient-centered, prescription drug label on all prescription medications dispensed to patients in California on or before January 1, 2011, and establishes requirements for standardized, patient centered prescription drug labels. The California Alliance for Retired Americans supported the bill stating that \"this bill establishes meaningful patient-centered prescription labeling in California. Patient-centered prescription labeling protects consumers from the serious consequences of medical errors when they don't have the ability to read or understand prescription drug labels. Seniors, who represent over 48% of the prescription drug users in California, and (LEP consumers], are especially vulnerable to this problem. We look forward to the day when seniors and (LEP consumers] are provided these simple protections that will save lives and save our state money by avoiding costly trips to the doctor or emergency room to remedy a medical error.\" The bill failed to pass in the Assembly Business, Professions and Consumer Protection Committee. 6 Legislative Proposals 12012 Supervisor Chan's office supports efforts to standardize the translation of prescription drug labels. 8. Change redetermination scheduling for Title 19 programs (amend the California Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14000-14029.8). The Medicaid State Plan is based on the requirements set forth in Title XIX of the Social Security Act and is a comprehensive written document created by the State of California that describes the nature and scope of its Medicaid (Medi-Cal) program. It serves as a contractual agreement between the State of California and the federal government and must be administered in conformity with specific requirements of Title XIX of the Social Security Act and regulations outlined in Chapter IV of the Code of federal Regulations. The State Plan contains all information necessary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (eMS) to determine if the State can receive Federal Financial Participation (FFP). Currently, redetermination is conducted only once a year, which is required by federal statute. Supervisor Chan's office supports efforts to streamline and improve the redetermination process for Title 19 programs. 9. Create presumptive Medi-Cal eligibility for every foster child (including ages 21-24). The California Legislature responded to the federal Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 by extending no-cost Medi-Cal eligibility to former foster youth aged 18 through 20 years as of October 1, 2000. Alameda County supports the development of a new aid code extending uninterrupted Medi-Cal eligibility to foster youth through the age of 24. Alameda County would use the state's existing presumptive eligibility framework, which requires legislation and negotiation with CMS through a Medicaid State Plan Amendment or new federal waiver. Supervisor Chan's office supports efforts that would create presumptive Medi-Cal eligibility for foster youth through the age of 24. 10. Get adequate cost-based mechanism for mental health parity law by changing funding formula from a capped rate to a capitated rate. Behavioral health benefits under California's Medi-Cal Managed Care Program are carved out from the physical health rates that the state negotiates with public and private managed care plans. Funding for the behavioral health carve out has effectively been capped since 1996, and it is both an outdated and dramatically underfunded allocation that was realigned to counties in FYll-12. Supervisor Chan's office supports legislation that would direct the Department of Health Care Services to develop a true capitation system for local health authorities that accurately reflects the risks and managed care opportunities for all Medi-Cal recipients. This is often referred to as a case rate, or per member per month payment. 11. Define healthcare portals (including school-based health centers) as essential medical services that health plans are required to reimburse. The State can require that managed care plans reimburse certain levels of service even if they are not directly contracted to the plan. These services are often referred to as essential health services, and they can be written into the contracts between DHCS and public and private health plans that offer coverage through Medi-Cal. Supervisor Chan's office supports efforts that would define healthcare portals as essential medical services, making them eligible for managed care plan reimbursement. 7 Legislative Proposals 12012 12. Eliminate the exclusion for arranging or providing emergency transportation under the Medi-Cal Administrative Activity (MAA) manual. The California Medi-Cal Administrative currently reads: transportation of enrolled Medi-Cal beneficiaries to Medi-Cal covered services provided by an enrolled Medi-Cal provider. When medically necessary, this activity may include the cost of accompanying Medi-Cal beneficiaries to Medi-Cal services. Supervisor Chan's office supports amending this section to allow MAA claiming for arranging or providing emergency medical transportation, which would be at no cost to the State. Alameda County could use local assessment revenues that fire departments already have as the Certified Public Expenditure -the State would act as a pass-through, the same way the State cu rrently does under the 111t wa iver and SB 695. 13. Request the State to develop guidelines for pediatricians and early dental education. Alameda County supports increasing utilization and availability of oral health care services and education in locations frequented by pregnant women, teens, children and their caregivers. According to the Alameda County Strategic Plan for Oral Health 2012-2017, as early as 9-15 months of age, 20% of children at WIC had evidence of early childhood dental decay; that percentage rises to 70% for those age 16 months to 5 years. Additionally, children from low-income families suffer twice as much untreated decay as children from higher-income families, and children in Alameda County have twice the level of urgent dental care needs as comparable children surveyed statewide. Also 52% of pregnant women in Ca Iifornia reported dental problems during pregna ncy; of those, 62% did not get ca re and the most freq uently cited reason was lack of perceived need by patient or provider. Studies have shown that dental decay infection in pregnant women raises the risk of dental decay infection in their children. Supervisor Chan's office supports guidelines that are aligned with Alameda County's guiding principles that: Every child has the right to a dental home. Prevention (as far upstream as possible, e.g. pre-natal) should take precedence over cure but urgent needs met. Dental services should begin by the 1st birthday. Oral health is integral to overall health. Services should be best practices including education, nutritional counseling, assessment as well as treatment and be available where people can easily access them such as WIC or schools. Oral health education should be required. Local solutions should be reflective of the communities they are intended to serve. Dental health care providers should be representative of the diversity of the communities they serve. Outreach and case management are integral to enabling families to access and enjoy the dental health care and health care system. Oral health surveillance and dissemination are essential to achieving the goals of the strategic plan. Programs should be regularly evaluated. 14. Increase the number of ambulatory provider visits per day for patients. Supervisor Chan's office supports removing the same day visit exclusion under California's Medi-Cal program to promote the integration of behavioral health services and improve the patient experience. 8 State Legislative Policies 9 State Legislative Policies 12012 Realignment Included in the Governor's 2010-11 Budget was a major shift of state program responsibilities to local governments. These responsibilities include oversight of various criminal justice and health and human services programs. Alameda County recognizes the intent of Realignment -that local delivery of these services can result in more efficiencies and cost effectiveness, and provide for rehabilitation of offenders who live in our community. However, there are a number of concerns regarding implementation. Alameda County supports the following: Constitutional protection guaranteeing adequate funding for programs realigned from the State Identification of permanent and stable revenue sources to fund county costs, with property taxes representing our top priority Funding formulas that do not disproportionately impact the County, or financial mitigation to address the disproportionate impacts if they occur An increase the Alcohol Tax to fund realigned health programs Maximum local control and flexibility in managing realigned programs, including the flexibility to reallocate funding am0 ng reaIigned prog rams, faiIs tocove rcosts Health & Human Services The 2010-11 State Budget included significant cuts to health and human services programs, affecting some of our most vulnerable residents, including seniors and people with disabilities who rely on systems of care that has been underfunded for years and has been severely compromised by cuts due to our current State budget crisis. These cuts include reductions to Adult Day Health Care, In Home Support Services (IHSS), SSl/SSP, Regional Center services, and Medi-Cal. Community-Based Systems of Care: Adult Day Health Care. When Governor Brown eliminated the Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) program, his administration designated the state's Medi-Cal managed care plans as the entity to ensure the care of the program's 35,000 seniors. Managed care plans will be responsible for health care only, however, which means the 880 seniors and people with disabilities living in Alameda County who receive ADHC services will lose day\u00ad to-day supervision, socia lization, thera pies and mea Is. The loss of these services will th reaten their ability to remain safely and successfully in the community. In-Home Support Services. In Alameda County, over 17,600 people receive the in-home care that enables them to live safely in the community and avoid serious medical complications, including nursing home placement. The 2011 budget cuts include a continuation of reduced hours and services cuts. SSI/SSP. In July 2011 the maximum monthly SSI/SSP grant for individuals dropped to the federal minimum of $830 a month, or $9,960 a year, which is $930 below the federal poverty line. In Alameda County, about 53,000 people rely on SSljSSP to meet their basic needs as their sole source of income. 10 State Legislative Policies 12012 Medi-Cal. There was $1.4 billion in state cuts this year to Medi-Cal funding. In Alameda County, 34,000 low\u00ad income seniors rely on Medi-Cal to cover all or part of their healthcare costs. Proposed reductions include limiting physician/clinic visits to seven per year; eliminating over-the-counter medications and nutritional supplements; introduction of patient co-payments; and a 10 percent reduction in reimbursement rates to providers. Regional Centers. Reductions include a continued 4.25 percent cut to service providers and Regional Center operations. Regional Center of the East Bay will receive a cut of $1.8 million to operations and an $18 million cut to service providers while planning to serve an additional 600 consumers. These cuts will result in higher case manager case loads, reduction in quality assurance, and limitations or reductions in direct services. These massive cuts to community-based programs threaten their sustainability and leave consumers with the untenable option of homelessness or government-funded institutional living. Institutional Jiving reduces one's quality of life, shortens longevity and is a much more costly alternative. Current public policy provides institutional living as an entitlement and community living as a second-place alternative. The Healthcare Services Agency supports; Both legislation and public policy that adequately funds community support systems and incorporates the four goals of disability policy; equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living and economic self sufficiency. Promotion of employment-first principles through public policy to increase employment among people with disabilities, including strategies that lead to integrated employment for persons with the most significant disabilities. These strategies will include statutes, regulations and operational procedures that will guide employment policy that leads to an increased employment rate for individuals with disabilities. Healthcare Services 1. Reducing Inequities in HIV HIVjAIOS impacts many communities in Alameda County. During the period of 1980-2008, a total of 9,698 HIV/AIDS cases were reported to the Alameda County Public Health Department (ACPHD) epidemiology surveillance unit. Of this total, 5,439 (56%) are people currently living with HIVjAIDS. The annual incidence rate of new HIV infections has not fallen in nearly two decades. The impact of this trend on behavior risk groups and minority populations is significant. Recent cuts to prevention and testing programs from the California State Department of Health will have devastating consequences for some of our most vulnerable populations. Alameda County supports the following items that promote and allow programs for comprehensive reproductive health education in school settings, provide health education and risk reduction strategies for individuals engaging in risky behavior, and increase funding for services for HIV positive individuals. Needle Exchange Programs: Injection drug use is the second leading cause of HIV transmission and the leading cause of Hepatitis C infection in California. The link between injection drug use and HIV in California is particularly strong for women and people of color. In Alameda County, injection drug use accounts for 24% of all AIDS cases among African Americans and 35% of all AIDS cases among women. Studies of needle exchange 11 State Legislative Policies 12012 programs have repeatedly shown that these efforts are successful in reducing the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C while showing no increase in the use of injection drugs. Current law requires that a county, through their Board of Supervisors, authorize the exchange of clean hypodermic needles and syringes as part of a network of comprehensive services, including treatment services. Alameda County first authorized needle exchange program services in December 1999. The ACPHD also supports pharmacies that have enrolled in the Pharmacy Syringe Sale and Disease Prevention Project. This program has been proven highly effective in providing increased access to clean syringes when someone is not able to get to a syringe exchange site. Currently in Alameda County, more than seventy pharmacies have enrolled in this program. Comprehensive Reproductive and Sexual Health Programs for Teens: National and statewide teen birth rates (births per 1,000 females ages 15 -19) were on the decline since 1991. In 2006 U.S. teen birth rates increased for the first time since 1991. Our county rate has increased over 9% from 2005 -2007. In 2008 the Latina teen birth rate (50.1 or 714 births) was over seven times higher than the Asian rate (7.1 or 73 births) and over five times higher than rates among Whites (9.0 or 122 births). The African American rate for teen births (34.3 or 328 births) is five times higher than the Asian rate (6.9) and over four times higher than rates among Whites (8.3). The highest rates of teen births are in areas of Oakland that include Fruitvale, East, and West, and among foreign-born teens. The number of some Sexually Transmitted Infections (STls) in young women under the age of 20 is almost equivalent to the numbers reported for all other women over the age of 20. This illustrates the high levels of unprotected sexual activity occurring in this population, creating greater opportunities for HIV transmission. Current AIDS data reflects that young people, age 13 -19 represent .4% of the cases. It is important to fund comprehensive reproductive and sexual health programs which stress abstinence, while also educating young people about contraception, family communication, responsible negotiating and decision making skills. Condom Distribution and HIV Testing in Jails and Prisons: At present, the distribution of condoms is prohibited within the County jail and State and federal prisons. Rates of many diseases are higher for the incarcerated than for the total US population. Among the incarcerated, rates of HIV are 8-10 times higher. Given the prolonged rates of incarceration and the cyclical nature of the system, many inmates are not equipped to access health services when released. When HIV and other STls are not prevented during incarceration, nor diagnosed in a timely manner, a greater transmission risk is incurred for their community partners. Condom distribution and routine, non-mandatory, HIV testing should be allowed in jails and prisons in order to prevent the spread of these diseases within the inmate population and among their partners in the community. An increase in successful demonstration projects will inform future policies of criminal justice systems and will further address the need to reduce HIV incidence. Medi-Cal Coverage for Formerly Incarcerated Individuals: In order to assist HIV positive individuals with the transition of their HIV treatment during reentry from State prison and County jail, we support any legislation that will automatically re-enroll released inmates into Medi-Cal. 12 State Legislative Policies 12012 HIV Testing: Support routine offering of HIV testing in all medical settings so that HIV testing would be administered in the same manner as diabetes and tuberculosis screenings. Support simplification and streamlining of the billing process for HIV testing with private insurance and Medi\u00ad Cal. Although it is legal for a person, ages 13 to 18, to confidentially test for HIV, current Medi-Cal billing practices inform pa rents of the test. Ease restrictions on who can perform HIV Rapid Testing. Currently, only licensed medical practitioners and State\u00ad Trained HIV test counselors are allowed to administer the HIV Rapid Test, specifically under state-funded programs. This restriction does not exist in most other states and is severely limiting California's state-wide HIV testing efforts. AIDS Drug Assistance Program: The AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) pays for prescription drugs for people who have limited or no coverage for medications and can't otherwise afford them. The program is managed by states, and most of them also contribute to the funding. The benefits and eligibility requirements vary widely state-by-state. The programs are in a funding crisis across the country. The ADAP Eligibility Criteria requires clients to be uninsured or under-insured for the cost of medications and have an annual Federal Adjusted Gross Income of less than $50,000 (clients with incomes greater than 400% of the Federal Poverty level might have a \"share of cost\" co-payment). More than 1,759 People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLW HIV/AIDS) throughout Alameda County received more than 43,000 prescriptions in FY 2009-2010, at an approximate cost per client of $7,675 and a total cost of more than $13.5M. At Santa Rita Jail (SRJ), approximately 200 incarcerated PLW HIV/AIDS per year receive almost 2,000 prescriptions at an approximate cost per inmate of $3,000 and a total cost of approximately $600,000. As of July 1,2010, these SRJ costs have been assumed by the Alameda County Sherriffs Department because the State de\u00ad funded ADAP coverage for city and county jail inmates to save approximately $9 million statewide per year. California ADAP funding sources for FY 2010 are: Federal Ryan White Part B funds (approximately 592 million), State General Funds (approximately $126 million), and rebate funds paid to ADAP by pharmaceutical companies for drugs that have been purchased by the program (approximately $207 million). Rebates generated by the program are kept in the ADAP \"Special Fund\". As the number of people living with HIV continues to increase, more State and federal funding will be required to maintain ADAP services in the community and to restore ADAP services for PLW HIV/AIDS when incarcerated at Sa nta Rita Jail. The average lifetime cost of healthcare for a person living with AIDS is over $600,000, or $24,200 per year. Programs such as needle exchanges, comprehensive reproductive health training for teens, condom distribution in jails and prisons, HIV testing and ADAP are cost-effective methods to limit these exorbitant healthcare costs. 2. Economic Well-being as a Social Determinant of Health Econom ic well-being and econom ic stability are powerful predictors of individua I and com munity health. Research shows that each step up the socioeconomic ladder correlates with increasingly favorable health, as referenced by the Alameda County Public Health Department's report \"Life and Death from Unnatural Causes.\" Those with higher socioeconomic status tend to live longer and experience fewer health problems across the life course, including adverse birth outcomes (e.g., low birth weight), disease risk factors (e.g., unhealthful diet, hypertension), chronic and infectious l3 State Legislative Policies 12012 diseases (e.g., diabetes, HIVjAIDS), and mental illnesses. Higher socioeconomic status (SES) is a \"fundamental cause\" of heaIth outcomes 'beca use it provides access to important heaIth-ena bling resources, including proper nutrition, good medical care, stable health insurance, and favorable housing -all of which can be leveraged to avoid risks and protect health. With each step down the SES ladder, resources and opportunities for health diminish. Additionally, children living in poverty are seven times more likely to have poor health than children living in high-income households. Childhood poverty has detrimental and long-lasting effects that adversely impact adult health. Diminished physical and emotional health affects academic success, which influences earning potential, and thereby poses the risk of passing on poverty and associated problems to the next generation. The U.S. government provides a regularly updated estimate of the poverty threshold -the point below which a household of a given size has insufficient cash income that is needed to meet minimal food and other basic needs. However, the official federal poverty level (FPl) is an imprecise measure of today's cost of living and dramatically underestimates the number of people struggling to make ends meet, as it fails to account for the rapid rise of, and geographic variance in, the cost of living.} The Census Bureau's American Community Survey 2010 estimates indicate that 200,498 individuals in Alameda County (13.5%) live in poverty using this very low threshold. The Self-Sufficiency Standard calculator, a fairer estimate of solvency hosted by the Insight Center for Community Economic Development, indicates that on average two adults with a preschooler and a school-age child in Alameda County need to earn $69,529 a year to meet basic housing, food, transportation, healthcare and childcare costs in 2011. This amount is more than triple the most recent Federal Poverty Guidelines of $22,350 for a 4-person family. Solutions that begin to address economic well-being include: Enact a Living Wage: Require that employers pay adequate wages (and benefits). California's minimum wage has been raised to $8.00 per hour, but this is still far from the wages needed to cover basic living expenses in Alameda County. A further increase in the state minimum wage would help close the affordability gap for low\u00ad income workers. Support Small Businesses / Microenterprise: Small business creation has been a path to America's middle class -particularly for people of color, immigrants, and the economically disadvantaged. Microentrepreneurs face disadvantages in establishing and operating their small businesses that larger businesses do not. According to the Aspen Institute, policies that support microenterprise include: supporting community-based non-profit microenterprise and financial organizations that support entrepreneurs, expanding access to private markets and sources of capital, and establishing supportive tax policies. Microenterprise could also be an eligible activity for recipients for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Social Security Disability Insurance, and could also be used as a prisoner re-entry strategy. Incentives for Employee Ownership: Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs) allow employees to own part of the company where they work. According to the Corporation for Enterprise Development, state policies aimed at promoting sound business conversion to employee ownership through tax incentives, state-mandated assistance, and employee ownership programs can all support owner-run businesses. 1 The U.S. Census Bureau is expected to reveal its own \"supplemental\" poverty estimates sometime thiS month based on benefits and expenses not included in the traditional computation. 14 State Legislative Policies 12012 Help Low-income People to Accumulate Assets Through Increased Savings and Investments: A variety of savings accounts and incentive programs are designed to help build assets and opportunities among low-income people, including individual development accounts (IDAs), children's savings accounts (CSAs), and tax-time education savings programs. According to the Corporation for Enterprise Development (CFED), IDAs are special savings accounts that match the deposits of low- and moderate-income savers, provided that they participate in financial literacy training and use the savings for targeted purposes -usually education, homeownership, or capitalizing a small business. CSAs are similar matched savings accounts established for children as early as birth and allowed to grow over a lifetime. CSAs can help low-income parents and students see college as an attainable goal. There is evidence that people who own assets are likely to have higher expectations for their futures and the futures of their children, which in turn results in higher GPAs and graduation rates. Many of the communities that would benefit most from the aforementioned programs lack the most basic financial tool: a bank account. One solution, Banking Development Districts (BODs), would provide incentives to banks that locate in underserved communities and help connect lower-income Californians with the financial products and services they need to enter the financial mainstream and begin to build savings and assets. BODs have proven successful in New York and similar efforts to bank the unbanked in California should be strongly supported. Retirement Saving Accounts for All Workers: Retirement accounts are another vehicle by which low-and moderate-income families can build assets. According to the New America Foundation, a disproportionate number of people of color rely on Social Security as a significant percentage of (sometimes entirely) their income after retirement, leaving them financially unprepared for life after leaving the workforce. Access to retirement savings vehicles for those who do not have access to a retirement savings plan at their workplace could supplement Social Security benefits through a voluntary, universal, portable savings account. Supporting universal access to Retirement Savings Plans would affect nearly 70 million Californians that are without an institutionally supported retirement savings account, and would help prepare disadvantaged populations for the economic realities of retirement. Homeownership: According to the Corporation for Enterprise Development, the home represents the single largest component of household wealth and is a fundamental asset for millions of Americans. Many low-income renters are subject to substandard living conditions. Homeownership provides physical and financial security. Policies to support homeownership include providing additional assistance to first-time homebuyers (down\u00ad payment assistance, competitively priced mortgage lending products, homebuyer education), curbing predatory mortgage lending and ensuring sound underwriting standards, establishing housing trust funds, and banning prepayment penalties. Financial Education: Financial literacy provides the knowledge and skills necessary for individuals to take control of their financial destiny. Unfortunately, a lack of access to such financial education impedes the ability of already disadvantaged populations from making the types of decisions that promote entrance to the financial mainstream and instead lead to financial mistakes. Programs and measures that seek to educate on a variety of personal finance topics, especially those that pair information with access, should be strongly supported. Some of these programs would include financial planning in the workplace, integration of financial literacy into high school curriculum, and a Financial Services Corps, made up of financial experts, planners, and advisers, that would deliver financial advice and resources to lower-income individuals and families. Eliminate Asset Tests in Public Benefit Programs: Many public benefit programs limit eligibility to those with few or no assets. If a family has assets over the State's limit, it must reduce longer-term savings in order to receive what is often short-term public assistance. According to the Corporation for Enterprise Development, personal savings and assets are necessary resources that families need to move off of public benefit programs and become self-sufficient. The eligibility rules currently penalize low-income families for saving with a 15 State Legislative Policies 12012 reduction or loss of benefits, thereby discouraging families from building the personal safety net they so desperately need to climb out of poverty and become self-sufficient. Similar policies could be applied to remove asset tests from Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), Medi-Cal, and Supplemental Security Income (S51). Restrictions on Payday lending: According to the Corporation for Enterprise Development, predatory payday lending is the practice of repeatedly making small short-term loans at annual interest rates averaging about 400%, tra pping borrowers in a cycle of debt. Payday lenders are disproportionately concentrated among communities of color. Predatory loans should either be banned or imposed with rate caps of 36% Annual Percentage Rate (APR) or less. Safer small-dollar loan products should be promoted as an alternative to payday lending. Enact State Earned Income Tal( Credit: The income of the working poor can be raised through earned income tax credits (EITC). The federal EITC is a refundable credit that low-income workers can receive as a tax refund. The EITC encourages low-income people to work and is credited with lihing millions of people out of poverty across the nation. California should emulate other states by implementing a state EITC, which would help working families to better make ends meet. In addition, more could be done to ensure that families are able to access the federa I EfTC. Reform Tal( Code: Close loopholes that allow individuals and corporations to avoid paying their share of taxes. 3. Reducing Inequities in Chronic Disease In Alameda County there are racial and ethnic disparities in premature deaths, incidence of disease, and health care access and utilization. Communities of color and low-income communities continue to fare poorest on most key indicators tracked over time by the Alameda County Public Health Department. African Americans are more likely to report fair/poor health status compared to Whites and low-income adults are over four times as likely to have fair or poor self\u00b7rated health as those from high-income households. Nutrition and Physical Activity: The three leading causes of death overall in Alameda County are heart disease, cancer, and stroke. This is consistent across all racial and ethnic groups with the exception of Native Americans. However, African Americans die from stroke and cancer at a significantly higher rate than all other racial and ethnic groups; the heart disease mortality rate is highest among Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders. The overall trends and health inequities for each of these three diseases are in decline. African American and Pacific Islander diabetes mortality rates were substantially higher than other racial/ethnic groups as well. Individual factors such as unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity and broader social and environmental factors that determine individual behavior choice are major causes of all of these diseases as well as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and osteoporosis. Physical activity is important in preventing obesity and other chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis and some types of cancer. A growing body of literature suggests that features of the built environment influence physical activity including neighborhoods with amenities within walking distance to work, school or home and perceived access to and safety of places to be physically active. In Alameda County, 38.5% of adults reported being physically active, with Whites being 1.5 times more likely to be physically active as African Americans. Tobacco: Tobacco-related illness remains the number one preventable cause of death in California and the U.S. It is responsible for an estimated 36,684 deaths in California each year. The California Air Resources Board 16 I State Legislative Policies 2012 declared in January 2006 that secondhand smoke is a toxic air contaminant, and the U.S. Surgeon General declared in June 2006 that there is no safe level of secondhand smoke. Almost 500,000 California children 18 years of age or younger are projected to die from smoking related disease. Additionally, regular exposure greatly increases a child's chances of premature births, low birth weight, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, asthma, ear infections, lung infections and damage to lung function. Over 95% of adults addicted to tobacco began smoking as teenagers. Tobacco companies utilize a variety of advertising techniques including point of sale ads, direct mailing and social media targeted at attracting young persons to become future addicts. Tobacco ads and price discounting are disproportionately targeted to low-income neighborhoods and communities of color. Asthma is a chronic disease that causes inflammation in the airways. It is the leading cause of hospitalizations for children under age 5. Alameda County has the second highest rate of asthma in the State. Environmental factors such as secondhand smoke and other sources of air pollution are significant triggers for asthma attacks. Unless the rapidly increasing problem of unhealthy eating and physical inactivity is addressed, the costs and consequences associated with the obesity epidemic will also continue to increase at an alarming rate. legislative solutions that could begin to address this problem include: Require and enforce mandatory physical education in schools K-12: Daily participation in P.E. classes is down from 42 percent in 1991 to 28 percent in 2003, among U.S. high school students. In California, more than 15 percent of teens reported that their school either does not require or offer P.E. classes. Many children do not participate in physical activity during out of school hours because it is not accessible or affordable. Currently, physical education is only reqUired for two of the four years of high school. Increased physical education time in moderate to vigorous physical activity will also impact the quality of movement that children and youth receive during the school day. Promote the initiation and prolonged duration of breastfeeding: Breastfeeding has been proven to provide a broad range of health benefits to both baby and mother including reducing a child's chance of becoming overweight or obese. Efforts to encourage and support breastfeeding are necessary to develop a foundation of good health. Limit the marketing of junk food to children: The Institute of Medicine recently issued a comprehensive list of recommendations to combat the obesity crisis, including the creation of guidelines to limit the marketing of junk food to children. In recent years junk food marketing has exploded adding fuel to the growing obesity epidemic. Expand the availability of healthful foods and decrease the availability of unhealthful foods: Healthful and nutritious foods must be made more easily available in low-income neighborhoods paired with a decrease in access to non-nutritious foods and beverages. Greater accessibility to healthful food will facilitate efforts to reduce obesity and related diseases. The State's pilot program to increase access to healthful foods should be expanded and greater financial incentives and/or assistance should be provided to retailers to implement the needed changes. Decrease the availability of unhealthful beverages through a statewide soda tax or fee: Approximately 60% of adolescents and 31% of children consume one or more sodas per day in Alameda County, according to a 2009 study by the California Center for Public Health Advocacy. Greater consumption of sweetened beverages is associated with weight gain and obesity among both adults and children. Reducing that consumption of soda and other sweetened drinks results in the reduction of weight gain and obesity. Efforts to impose industry fees and/or taxes on sodas and other sugar-sweetened beverages could have a significant impact on lowering rates of obesity and diabetes. The resultant increase in revenue should be held in a separate fund for the promotion, 17 State Legislative Policies 12012 initiation, and support of increasing fresh fruit and vegetable availability in low income neighborhoods affected by the obesity epidemic. Such a tax or fee could raise as much as $1.5 billion for chronic disease prevention. Improve utilization of food assistance programs: The complexity of applying for and maintaining eligibility for food assistance programs is frequently a barrier to low-income families. Streamlining the application for nutrition programs would greatly impact the numbers of children served. Efforts to simplify these procedures to increase enrollment in the Food Stamp Program, Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and School Meals Program (Breakfast/Lunch) are being actively pursued in Alameda County. The Alameda County Community Nutrition Action Partners (CNAP) has worked in partnership with Assembly Member Skinner and Senator Hancock to amend the State Education Code to allow for the sharing of application data across other USDA food/nutrition program lines. This action will allow \"well\" utilized USDA Programs such as the WIC Program to share client application data with the \"under\" utilized USDA food/nutrition programs of Food Stamps and School Meals. AB 402, chaptered in 2011, will enable local school districts to apply for a waiver to the California Department of Education to share information and use a multi-program streamlined application for the Cal Fresh program. Only 51% of eligible people received Food Stamps in Alameda County in 2008. The California Food Policy Advocates and America's Second Harvest outlined the problem in their studies \"Knocking Down Barriers\" and \"The Red Tape Divide: State-by-State Review of Food Stamp Applications\" respectively. Alameda County supports all efforts at the State legislative level to simplify the Food Stamp application and eligibility process (specifically eliminating finger imaging). These changes are thought to increase participation in the Food Stamp Program. Reduce smoking and limit secondhand smoke exposure and decrease youth access to tobacco' products and marketing: The Public Health Department supports provisions that 1) protect individuals from secondhand smoke exposure, 2) strengthen laws to reduce youth access to tobacco products, 3) counter pro-tobacco influences including advertising and media images or content, 4) reduce or eliminate the retailing of new tobacco or nicotine products, and 4) promote tobacco cessation. Create \"Asthma-Friendly\" communities: ACPHD supports policies that create \"Asthma-Friendly\" communities, especially those that eliminate the disproportionate burden of asthma for people living in poverty and communities of color. This goal can be achieved through optimizing the diagnosis, treatment and management of asthma by adherence to the current National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's asthma guidelines; expanding the reach of proven case management programs for serving persons with asthma; utilizing community health workers and trained professionals; improving air quality and reducing diesel emissions in our communities. 4. Early Intervention Services The budget cuts of 2009 changed the eligibility criteria for the California Early Intervention Program, by increasing the level of developmental delay a child must have to be eligible for services. Prevention Programs were established for children under 36 months of age otherwise not eligible for the Early Intervention Program but whose genetic, medical, developmental, or environmental history was predictive of greater risk for developmental disability. Prevention programs were created by the State of California at each regional center for infants who had medical risk factors (such as prematurity or low birth weight) or toddlers with delays in only one developmental domain. Each child was assigned a Prevention Coordinator to provide case management, developmental screening and monitoring, information on community resources, and referrals to workshops and trainings. Effective July I, 2011, the State of California mandated the transfer of a reduced scope Prevention Program to the Family Resource Centers. This version of the Prevention Program will provide intake, assessment, case management and referral to generic agencies only with significantly reduced funding. 18 State Legislative Policies 12012 Early intervention includes developmental and therapeutic services provided to infants and toddlers, from birth to age three, and their families through Part C of IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. High risk children, particularly those at risk due to parental developmental disability, are in danger of developing a range of disabilities, including speech and language delay, cognitive/intellectual delay, behavioral and social-emotional involvement. Early intervention services are extremely important to child ren who face developmental challenges. Nea rly half of the children who received early intervention services no longer needed special education services by the end of their kindergarten year according to the National Early Intervention Longitudinal Study (NEILS). The Healthcare Services Agency supports the following: Legislation that restores funding and services to pre-2009 levels and secures new funding to enlarge the capacity of early intervention services. Increasing federal support for this program, putting policies in place to ensure high quality services and funding additional research on early intervention. 5. Disaster Preparedness and Public Health Infrastructure Several hurricanes in the Midwest and Southwest, an earthquake in Washington, DC and wildfires in Texas and Southern California this year clearly demonstrate the need to ensure that we have systems in place in Alameda County to respond in a timely manner to a disaster. The H1Nl influenza virus put tremendous pressure on the public health and health care system infrastructure as well. In 2010 and 2011 the system responded to pertussis cases (whooping cough). The Mehserle verdict and resulting events in Oakland also required coordinated planning and response from the public health and health care system to ensure hospitals, clinics and ambulance providers were prepared to treat the injured, if the situation escalated. The Public Health Department continues to work in collaboration with other County, State and Federal agencies, local hospitals and clinics, and other institutions to strengthen our communications and responsiveness. However, without a reinforced Public Health infrastructure, an adequate long-term health response to future disasters will become increasingly more difficult. This is at a time when some of the funding for disaster preparedness is being reduced. Improve the County's preparedness for any form of disaster or event, by addressing and prioritizing the following systems to enhance skills and capacity in these functional service areas: Surveillance and epidemiology Public health la boratories Communications systems (interoperable systems) Pharmacy needs Emergency medical services Training and coordination of disaster service workers Training and coordination of health care personnel and volunteers Credentialing system Emergency medication/vaccination dispensing sites Municipal and utility service operations, i.e.; water, wastewater, electricity Solutions that begin to address disaster preparedness include: 19 State Legislative Policies 2012 Promote public health workforce development: A qualified public health workforce is needed to staff our frontline response to natural disasters and to potential biological threats. However, an estimated 43% of the State's public health workforce could be lost in the next couple of years due to retirements and other factors. Legislation to promote the recruitment and retention of new public health professionals to replace our aging workforce should be supported. Priority should be given to recruit members of underseNed and under\u00ad represented populations into the public health and emergency response workforce. Improve communication between disparate organizations and levels of government: Clear leadership at the State level provided by the State Department of Public Health should promote this kind of communication. In addition, regional planning must take place to create communications systems that will be functional in a mutual aid response situation. Additional funding may be needed to support such systems. Develop systems to ensure that services can be delivered in a timely and efficient manner to vulnerable populations. Special consideration needs to be given to serving vulnerable populations, including: children and adults with disabilities requiring functional or access support services2, low income populations, seniors, children and individuals with language barriers, in a manner that will be accessible and inclusive. Pre-planning for disaster response must be focused on those who will be least able to help themselves in the event of a large\u00ad scale public health emergency. Support legislation which promotes funding opportunities for pre-disaster mitigation: Pre-disaster mitigation is especially important to protect first responders, the safety net and public health infrastructure, so that California can respond to all disasters without being vulnerable. For example, retrofitting fire stations and hospitals is needed so that the buildings will not be damaged in earthquakes. Prioritize no cost or low cost training opportunities that promote skill development: The State should promote a system to ensure all government, first responder, first receiver staff and other professionals are adequately trained in preparedness and response systems, communication and specialized targeted skills, where appropriate. Support legislation which promotes the improvement of Municipal Service Utilities to help ensure service delivery before, during and after an event: California's aging infrastructure is widely held as a priority to its overall health and well-being. However, if and when confronted with major service interruptions due to catastrophic events, whether natural or manmade, public health impacts could be immediate and costly (e.g. spread of disease due to contaminated water sources and/or improper disposal of waste materia lsi. Support Public Education and Awareness to the reality of a disaster or emergency event: Institute outreach activities and promote resources to educate the general public about the importance of general sanitation practices during an event to help minimize the spread of disease as a result of an event. 6. Alcohol Policy Principles Current law and regulation provide valuable tools that can be used to develop strategies for changing many high-risk environments in which alcohol and other drugs (AOD) are used. This \"environmental\" approach to AOD prevention focuses on changes in laws, public policies and social norms to reduce and prevent problems related to the use of alcohol and other drugs. The principles noted below, when applied through actual legislative changes, will enhance the ability of concerned community and neighborhood groups to reduce and prevent alcohol and other drug related problems. 1 Children and Adults with disabilities requiring functional or access support services have physical, sensory, mental health and cognitive and/or intellectual disabilities affecting their ability to function independently without assistance. 20 State Legislative Policies 12012 The ACPHD proposes the adoption of the seven principles discussed below in order to reduce alcohol-related problems and foster the development of healthy communities. The ACPHD anticipates the introduction of related state legislation in the future, to which the department will respond based on these stated principles. 1. Reduce the social availability of alcohol to youth: The availability of alcohol to youth through social sources, including parents, older siblings, or teen parties, must be reduced or eliminated. Social host liability laws, which subject adults providing alcohol to persons under the age of 21 to civil action and hold them accountable for injuries that occur as a result of underage drinking, represent a means of achieving this goal. 2. Stop the targeting of youth for alcohol advertising: It is currently very difficult for parents and other adults to control a youth's exposure to alcohol advertising, marketing, and promotions, which frequently associate alcohol use with success, attractiveness and popularity. Strategies for addressing this problem may include: Limiting the sponsorship of community events by the alcohol industry, tightening section 25664, the advertising to minors section of the Alcohol Beverage Control code and supporting enforcement of existing local advertising regulations that control the placement and display of advertising. 3. Reduce the availability of alcohol products targeted to youth market: Alcohol products such as flavored malt beverages (alcopops), with their colorful packaging and fruity sweet flavors, are targeted to underage youth, particularly young girls. Marketing the products as \"malt\" beverages (beer), despite their being primarily distilled spirits, has allowed them to be taxed at a significantly lower rate, advertised on lV, and sold in convenience stores, small markets and other \"beer and wine\" stores. Taxing alcopops as distilled spirits and limiting sales to Type 21 off-sale licensees will significantly reduce the access and availability of this product to underage youth. Other products that are targeted to youth are Alcohol Energy Drinks, which are prepackaged beverages that combine alcohol with caffeine. The Marin Institute researched these beverages and found that youth aged 14-20 who combined energy drinks with alcohol reported doing so in order to hide the flavor of alcohol, to be able to drink more and to stay awake longer, among other reasons. Youth who drank alcohol mixed with energy drinks were at higher risk of negative consequences such as violence and driving while intoxicated, compared to youth who drank alcohol without caffeine. S8 39, chaptered in 2011, addressed the concern of Alcohol Energy Drinks by prohibiting their sale in California. 4. Stop the \"Bundling\" and \"Pre-approval\" of alcohol permit applicatIons to developers: In order to skirt the issue of over-concentration, applications for alcohol permits are often bundled together and/or pre-approved without any identification of a specific reta iler(s). This is contra ry to Cal ifornia Alcoholic Beverage Control practice, which requires the identification of a specific applicant before consideration for approval. However, this practice by local municipalities gives tacit land use approval to an ABC license applicant without local review of the worthiness of the applicant or the needs of the community. A requirement that any alcohol permit application must identify a specific ABC license applicant would rectify this problem. 5. Renew efforts to deter alcohol-impaired driving: Between 1999 and 2008, California experienced 8,338 alcohol involved fatal collisions which resulted in 9,657 persons killed. Nationally there has been a 37% increase in alcohol-impaired driving from 1997 to 1999, where it has remained since 2002, despite safer cars and highways. Policies to deter alcohol-impaired driving include: lowering the legal blood-alcohol levels, prompt suspension of a driver's license for people arrested for driving under the influence, expanded sobriety checkpoints, alcohol\u00ad ignition interlock programs and sustained health education that includes efforts to reduce binge drinking. 6. Reduce the overconcentration of alcohol sales establishments in neighborhoods: A high concentration of retail alcohol licenses in communities is considered a risk factor for youth growing up in that environment. There is a 21 State Legislative Policies 12012 correlation in Alameda County of health inequities in neighborhoods with a high concentration of alcohol establishments. Public health research has consistently linked high crime and violence rates to high concentrations of alcohol licenses. Policies that can reduce the current number of licenses, or number of problem Iicenses, and/or lim it new licenses from being placed in neighborhoods al ready over-concentrated should be supported. Reducing over-concentration will reduce health inequities and improve the health, safety and quality of life in our communities. This can be accomplished by (1) the systematic and sustained enforcement of regulations that includes outreach, education, monitoring and an enforcement program funded by an annual fee paid by alcohol retailers to reduce over-concentration through attrition; and (2) limiting the active status of new alcohol permits to 10 years, at which time the permit will have to be reviewed prior to renewal. The goal is to promote a balanced environment of retail sales activities in neighborhoods, and reduce the dependence on alcohol sales for revenue. 7. Support alcohol taxes to pay for public health and safety costs, reduce alcohol harm and underage drinking: Alcohol taxes have not been raised in California since 1992 when the tax was increased by a penny per drink. Since that time, the real value of alcohol taxes in California has decreased 45 percent due to rising inflation. Raising alcohol taxes has been shown to be a highly effective tool in reducing a wide range of harm and consequences among all age groups. Such harms include alcohol dependence, liver cirrhosis, and risky sexual behaviors leading to STDs, traffic fatalities, and especially underage drinking. For example, adjusting the federal beer tax for the inflation rate since 1951 would have reduced automobile fatalities among 18-to 20-year-old youths by 15%. A report issued by the Institute of Medicine specifically recommended raising taxes on alcohol as the most comprehensive and effective method of reducing underage drinking. The total economic cost of alcohol in California is $38.4 billion annually. This translates to roughly $1,000 per California resident each year. An alcohol tax would help to reduce the use of alcohol and mitigate its negative consequences. 7, Promote a Healthier Built Environment The \"built environment\" refers to the human-made surroundings that provide the setting for human activity, such as roads, buildings, sidewalks, farms or parks. Public health professionals understand the powerful impact the built environment has upon health choices and outcomes, and planners comprehend the strong correlations between what makes a well-designed community for design's sake and what makes a well-designed community for health's sake. With the passage of AS 32 and 58 375 that require the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) and the integration of transportation, land use and housing planning, California is on the forefront of built environment policies. The implementation of these two bills at the regional and local level can have an impact on planning decisions in toeaI communities to reduce GHG and improve health. The Healthcare Services Agency supports policies and legislation that would: Require a health element in or health language throughout all general and regional plans. Require inclusionary housing policies, which require mixed-income housing development. Prevent the negative consequences of vacant and blighted property. Increase access to grocery stores, farmers' markets, and other sources of fruits and vegetables throughout communities. Limit access to liquor, tobacco, and unhealthy food outlets. Locate higher density housing near rail and bus lines, while setting standards to protect for mitigating risks associated with density. Reduce toxic emissions and chemical exposures. Increase funding for parks, trails, and recreation centers. 22 State Legislative Policies 12012 Support access to and affordability of public transit. Develop programs that increase pedestrian and cycling mobility, reduce car trips, and calm traffic. Promote the use of universal design to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities. 8. Universal Developmental Screening Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are a group of developmental disabilities that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges. The CDC estimates that an average of 1 in 110 children in the U.S. has an Autism Spectrum Disorder. The practice of developmental screening is widely endorsed but minimally utilized in the busy practice of the average pediatrician. Pediatricians identify developmental delays through developmental surveillance, a continuous procedure in which the health professional observes the infant, takes a developmental history, and elicits parental concerns. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly believes in the importance of early and continuous surveillance and screening for ASD to ensure that children are identified and receive access to services as early as possible. ACPHD supports the screening of all children for developmental delays and disabilities during regular well child visits at 9, 18 and 24 or 30 months. In addition, the ACPHD endorses the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendations that children should be screened specifically for ASDs during regular well child visits at 18 and 24 months. Additional screening should be used for those children at high risk for ASDs. 9. Violence Prevention Alameda County supports legislation that funds and addresses root causes of all forms of violence. We consider violence to include intimate partner violence, family violence, gun violence, gang violence, suicide and homicide, police and prison guard violence, commercial sexual exploitation of minors, youth violence, hate violence, sexual assault, child and elder abuse. Gun violence has been a particularly difficult problem in Alameda County. Between 2006 and 2008, 83.5% of homicide victims were killed by firearms. Alameda County's homicide rate from 2006-2008, in addition to exceeding the statewide rate, was almost three times higher than the national Healthy People 2020 objective of 5.5 or fewer homicides per 100,000 population. Moreover, Africa n America ns and Latino men are disproportionately affected by violence. For example, from 2006 to 2008 the homicide mortality rate for African American men was 79.2 per 100,000 and for Latino men it was 15.9, whereas for white men it was 4.0. Given the complexity of issues, policies and systems that promote or prevent violence, success requires an action plan that coordinates, supports, and strengthens a range of efforts. Solutions that address violence prevention include: Promote positive child and youth development: Young people need skills and supports that will enable them to negotiate potentially volatile situations, form strong attachments and relationships, participate in their schools and communities in a meaningful way and have hope for the future. Providing these supports and opportunities is vital for both short-term and long-term reductions in violence. To this end, all young people should have access to violence prevention skills development, menta ring, positive environments, meani ngful activities, career path opportunities, and trauma reduction assistance. Ensure supported and functioning families: Families are a cornerstone in the community and it is through family interaction that values, beliefs, and norms are instilled into our society. All families in Alameda County should have access to interdisciplinary programs that help maximize effective parenting and decrease family violence. 23 State Legislative Policies 12012 Foster safe and vibrant neighborhoods: Recommendations for achieving safe and vibrant neighborhoods include the following: Firearms: Reduce the availability and usage oJ firearms. Conflict resolution: Create pro-active dispute resolution structures and support at the neighborhood and school level. Gang prevention: Reduce gang violence through appropriate services, programs and outreach to those at risk of gang participation and to those already involved. The focus should be on ameliorating the root causes and risk factors of gang violence and not focused solely on suppression strategies. Alcohol availability: Decrease the density of alcohol outlets and advertising. Restorative justice: Implement remedial rather than punitive justice programs with community organizations and the justice system. Reentry: Create more via ble connections between comm unities and detention faci Iities, through A) preventing discrimination in hiring and housing assistance, B) incentives for hiring formerly incarcerated persons, C) supporting transition from detention to the community through physical and mental health services, substance abuse treatment, housing, job training and employment services, and 0) supports for family members. Employment: Promote job training and placement programs as well as the creation of living wage jobs. Physical environment: Improve the physical appearance of neighborhoods by fostering arts programs and community gardens, improving park, school, and neighborhood maintenance, improving lighting and removing graffiti and blight. Community Development Alameda County's Housing and Community Development Department is concerned about the long-term resources that Redevelopment Agencies provide to affordable housing statewide. Redevelopment tax increment provides $1 billion for affordable housing each year in communities across the State \u00ad easily the largest source of fundi ng for these types of developme nt. Should Redevelopment Age ncies be elim inated, the Legislature has yet to identify any alternate funding streams for the provision of affordable housing. Housing and Community Development supports: PoliCIes that increase the availability of funding for affordable and supportive housing for those most at risk in communities. Public Works The Alameda Public Works Agency depends on local, state, and federal funding sources to deliver all of its services to the community. Significant economic, regulatory and legislative trends affect the Agency's capacity to implements its programs. With increasing fuel efficiency and the introduction of hybrid and electric vehicles, revenues from the Gas Tax, the primary source for transportation infrastructure maintenance and project delivery, are expected to continue to decline. Clearly, the current economic environment is contributing to declines in other revenue sources, making it difficult to fund critical infrastructure projects. Furthermore, regulatory inefficiencies continue to hamper the effective and timely delivery of flood control and transportation projects. To this end, the Agency seeks legislative remedies in streamlining regulatory burdens while advocating for any and all funding opportunities at all levels of government. 24 State Legislative Policies 12012 The Alameda County Public Works Agency supports any methods to increase the gas tax and alternative methods of financing. Without the ability to increase the gas tax purchasing power, and in the absence of other funding methods, transportation funding will continue to decline. The Public Works Agency supports legislation that will: Increase and/or require the gas tax to be adjusted regularly to support its \"buying power\" Protect and provide increased funding for operating, maintaining, rehabilitating, and improving transportation infrastructure including local streets and roads, bicycle and pedestrian facilities Improve the ability of the Public Works Agency to deliver, enhance, or augment Alameda County Public Works Agency projects and programs Encourage regional cooperation and coordination to develop, promote and fund solutions to regional problems. Child Care Planning Council The Alameda County Child Care Planning Council advises and makes recommendations to policymakers to ensure that all children and families have access to quality child care that educates children and enriches their lives. This Council is comprised of 35 member; half are appointed by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors and half by the Superintendent of Schools. PUBLIC POLICY AGENDA: 1. Support increased revenue-generating options and efficiency measures to close local, state, and federal budget shortfalls, including efforts to modify the state's 2/3 vote requirement to raise revenue. 2. Promote efforts to protect, stabilize, and increase local, state, and federal funding, and attain new resources for Early Care and Education IECE) and ECE professional development. 3. Monitor and take positions on federal, state and local issues, legislation and initiatives that significantly impact ECE quality, access and affordability. 4. Advocate for family centered, developmentally and culturally*'\" appropriate practices for all children in care as well as those in tranSitional kindergarten. 25 Federal Legislative Policies 26 Community Development Alameda County, like many other communities, is experiencing a severe housing crisis. Alameda County residents are facing record levels of pre-foreclosure and default, foreclosure, Action/Trust sales, and Bank Repossession and homeIessness. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs that fund affordable housing development are critical to cover a portion of the costs associated with pre-development, acquisition, new construction and rehabilitation, as well as to leverage private funding such as community banks acting in accord with Community Reinvestment ACT (CRA) requirements. FY 2012 funding reductions for these HUD programs substantially limits the development of new affordable housing in Alameda County. Further reductions and failure to restore funding to levels at or above FY 2011 may jeopardize the County's ability to develop even limited new projects for which there is a demonstrated need. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) was authorized by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA). Under the NSP, Alameda County has acquired and redeveloped foreclosed properties that might otherwise be aba ndoned and eventua lIy become blighted. These efforts may sta bilize neigh borhoods, encourage community investment, stem the decline of values of neighboring homes and will increase the affordable housing stock in Alameda County. Federal programs and funding are critically needed to provide support for local governments to keep families housed, and to end homeless ness. Housing and Community Development supports: Support an increase in overall HUD funding FY 2013, and in particular Affordable Housing and related programs Support increased funding for HUD Homeless Assistance Support robust funding for the HOME Program Support robust funding for the Community Development Block Grant Program and oppose any efforts to decrease the cap on administrative costs for the program Support full implementation of the HEARTH Act, including the Emergency Shelter Program/Emergency Services Program Emergency Solutions Grant Support robust funding for the Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS Extension or reauthorization of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) Increased funding for HUD Homeless Assistance Programs Support the continuation of and increased funding for SAMHSA Homeless Services. Support increased funding to assist homeless veterans and their families obtain and maintain affordable housing o Fund HUD-VASH Vouchers to provide housing and services, to homeless veterans o Fund new Supportive Services for Veterans Families (SSVF) projects. Support efforts to protect homeowners from foreclosure and tenants living in foreclosed properties Public Works The Public Work Agency supports the California Consensus Principles, a set of principles developed by a variety of stakeholders including transportation agencies, Caltrans, the Business Transportation and Housing Agency, and then\u00ad Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2008. These Principles are intended to provide a uniform, statewide position on transportation issues to Congress and the President, and consist of the following: Ensure the financial integrity of the Highway and Transit Trust Fund Rebuild and maintain transportation infrastructure in a good state of repair 27 Establish goods movement, as a national economic priority Enhance mobility through congestion relief within and between metropolitan areas Strengthen the federal commitment to safety and security, particularly with respect to rural roads and access Strengthen com prehensive environmental stewardship Streamline Project Delivery In November 2011, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously passed Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP~21), a two-year, $109 billion surface transportation reauthorization bill. This bill, if passed by Congress, will replace the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA-lU) when it expires on March 31, 2012. Federal legislation for transportation is at a critical juncture. SAFETEA-lU was passed in 2005 and was set to expire in September 2009, although it has been extended and is now in effect until March 2012. Federal transportation funds provide between 13-20% of transportation and transit project costs, so it is an important resource for local transportation and transit projects. The new surface transportation legislation will direct the priorities for allocation of these funds. To pay for these projects, federal gas taxes are collected and placed in two accounts, the Highway Trust Fund and the Mass Transit Account. Gas tax revenues have declined and the Highway Trust Fund will reach insolvency in 2013, per Congressional Budget Office projections. There has been talk by legislators of cutting the federal transportation funding by 30%, which would have a serious ripple effect on the economy, road repairs and transit operations at the local level. In California with the passage of AS 32 and SB 375, requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) and the integration of transportation, land use and housing planning, the federal transportation legislation that will be passed will provide funding for these efforts. The Alameda County Board of Supervisors has been proactive in addressing climate change by passing policies and ordinances to address sustainability. Some of these include a County Climate Action Plan that addresses reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) and Alameda County is one of the initial signatories to the us Cool Counties Initiative. The new federal surface transportation bill should take into account the changing environment we live in and address America's dependence on cars and trucks as the major form of transportation. The current allocation for federal transportation funding is 80% for highways and 20% for transit. In addition, transit operating expenses are not an allowable expense. As local public transit service routes are being reduced, and costs to maintain the system are increasing, fares have increased. At the same time that there is a focus on reducing GHG, public transit is tess able to efficiently transport populations. This has an effect on the users of these systems, most impacted are the individuals that have the least financial resources. As an example, AC Transit has reduced routes and changed route times. At the same time, they have proposed an increase in the cost of youth bus passes, passes for seniors and disabled populations. These are populations that are on fixed incomes or families that have seen their incomes decline by 8.1%. Without adequate funding for transit, there is risk of increased truancy, reduced participation in school breakfast/lunch programs, and reduced access to after-school activities, to jobs and basic needs -such as medical care and grocery stores. Recommendations for the surface transportation bill are: At a minimum, maintain transportation funding at the current level. The impact on the economy, jobs and access to services would be devastating if funding was reduced. Ensure healthy communities and active living, by increasing allocations for walking and biking infrastructures, public transit and housing near transit and jobs, to provide for increased physical activity. 28 Provide a larger percentage of the allocation to improve and expand public transit systems, specifically targeted to operators who serve communities that do not have financial resources to own a car, so these communities can get to school, to jobs and to needed services. Expand funding for public transit operations to allow for reasonable pricing for low income, youth, disabled and senior populations to be able to afford the use of public transit systems. Require and fund \"Complete Streets\" that allow individuals to get to where they need to go in a safe and efficient manner. Complete streets policies ensure that roadways are designed to safely accommodate all users, including bicyclists, pedestrians, transit riders, children, older people, and disabled people, as well as motorists. California passed AB 1358 into law in 2008 requiring that city and county general plans incorporate complete streets policies. Include funding allocations to improve air quality, reduce GHG and improve the health of communities near ports and trucking routes that are unequally impacted by freight transport. Include metrics for determining that transportation funds are expended in a manner that increases the efficiency of transportation systems, reduces GHG and improves community and individual health and safety. Ensure that no transportation projects violate Title IV of the Civil Rights Act. It is recommended that Alameda County continue to monitor the MAP-21 legislation to determine its impact on the County' S transportationand infra structure prog rams. It is further recommended that Alameda County support continued funding to ensure the County's transportation and infrastructure programs are maintained. Support Project Delivery Streamlining Delivery of projects is often bogged down by the multiple and mostly redundant approval processes and long timeframes, including environmental clearance and mitigation, design approval, right of way certification, and project financing. The Public Works Agency supports: Legislation that improves environmental streamlining, including requiring specific time frames for state and federal reviews and approvals, to expedite project delivery while ensuring appropriate environmental protection and mitigation; Legislation that improves the ability to deliver projects and programs in a timely and cost-effective manner; and, Innovative project delivery methods including design-build and design-sequencing methods of contracting for flood control and transportation projects, and public/private partnerships. Health Care Services 1. Healthcare Access and Affordabilitv Although the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act (PPACA) continues to grant major health reforms to Americans, confusion reigns about the laws. As recently as late February 2011, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that nearly half of Americans thought that health reform had been repealed or said they didn't know whether that was the case. The Health Care Services Agency supports the following healthcare access and affordability proposals: a) Single payer health coverage, and federal and state proposals aimed at streamlining the complicated health care financing system -with employers paying multiple insurers, who then pay providers -into one single-payer (e.g. the State of California) 29 b) Increase Medi-Cal provider rates: Medi-Cal provider rates continue to erode and fail to reflect true medical costs. Declining reimbursement rates are compromising the health care safety net that many poorer residents depend upon. Certain specialties have limited or no new access (e.g. dental, orthopedics). Although the Affordable Care Act will raise Medicaid payment rate for primary care physicians, including pediatricians, to 100% of Medicare rates in 2013-14, it is unclear whether the rate increase will apply to pediatric specialists. Provider rates must be increased to stem the number of providers opting out of Medi-Cal participation. cl Streamline public health insurance enrollment: This, plus enhanced assistance with application and system navigation with attention to language and cultural competencies, will help consumers better understand, access and use appropriate health services. d) Eliminate mid-year eligibility review an.d provide one year of extended continuous coverage for health insu ranee enrollment. e) Support State funding of undocumented health care: Ensure the provision of preventive health and health care services to undocumented individuals to protect their health, the health of the public at large, and to prevent more costly health care costs that may ensue if these individuals do not get appropriate and prompt care. f) Maintain health coverage during budget gaps: In 2010, it took 100 days to adopt the California state budget. During that delay, seniors, physically disabled children and adults were left without services as providers dealt with insufficient or zero funding. Improve/enforce statutes governing California's budget process to eliminate devastating impacts on vulnerable populations. This would ensure consistent financial support to persons dependent on health and social services. g) Expand employer coverage of dependents; insure single adults: The Affordable Care Act offers some relief to young adults who will be able to remain insured through their parents' health plan until age 26. State-based health insurance exchanges, designed to give more citizens access to affordable health care, also will help but will not be operational until 2014. Support affordable health care options (private or employer based) for young and/or single adult. h} Expand access through innovations in health care service delivery: Work with providers to develop new, lower cost and more accessible treatment alternatives (Hea lth Ca re Porta Is) in schools, comm unity colleges, faith based settings, and fire stations. 2. Reducing Inequities in HIV The re-evaluation of HIV incidence data at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently revealed that 56,300 new cases occurred in 2006 alone, which is 40% higher than previous estimates of 40,000 new HIV cases annually, in the United States. The annual incidence rate of new HIV infections has not fallen in nearly two decades. The impact of this trend on behavior risk groups and minority populations cannot be overstated. Needle Exchange Programs: In December 2009, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, which modified the ban on use of Federal funds for needle exchange programs (also known as syringe exchange programs [SEPs]) for many health and human services programs. However, authorizations for some health and human services programs may still contain partial or complete bans on the use of funds for needle exchange programs. The modified provision prohibits the use of funds for SEPs in any location that local public health or law enforcement agencies determine to be inappropriate. 30 The Healthcare Services Agency supports: Federal legislation that promotes and allows programs for comprehensive reproductive health education in school settings, provides health education and risk reduction strategies for individuals engaging in risky behavior, and increases funding for services for HIV positive individuals. Federal legislation that would permit a county receiving federal awards for HIV prevention to use those funds to support needle exchange programs, authorized by the county, to purchase sterile hypodermic needles and syringes. Federal legislation that would permit condom distribution and HIV testing in prisons. Federal legislation that would permit Medicaid coverage for formerly incarcerated individuals. Increased federal funding for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. 3. Reducing Inequities in Chronic Disease Federally-funded child nutrition programs that serve low-income children in Alameda County include the school meals program (breakfast and lunch), child care meals, afterschool snacks, summer foods, the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. These programs were reauthorized by Congress in FY 2011 as part of the Healthy, and the Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Increasing access to these programs will improve the health of low-income children in California and across the country. Changes in the National School Breakfast Lunch Program -As this program is sorely underutilized, recommendations to reallocate resources in this program would be in order. The amount allocated per student for meal reimbursement should be increased to adequately cover food, supplies, labor, utilities, and other costs that will allow school districts to better meet the needs of students so that they are ready to learn. Congress should also change the meal reimbursement process to ensure that the program will continue to be funded even if participation exceeds initial estimates. Additional strategies to be pursued include using Farm-to-School Programs to help bolster salad bars and allocating funding for fresh produce for the after school snack menu. Women, Infants, and Children Program -Support the 2010 funding recommendations of the National WIC Association and the California WIC Association including fully funding the WJC food and nutrition services and administration (NSA), replenishing the Contingency fund (in the case of unpredictable caseload or food cost spikes), ensuring that State WIC programs can fully expend federal WIC funds, increasing funding for breastfeeding peer counseling, and supporting WI( evaluation and outcomes research related to the implementation of the new WIC food packages. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act) became law on June 22, 2009. It gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products to protect public health. Alameda County recognizes the public health benefits of this Act, and supports efforts to reduce youth access, increase cessation services, and reduce tobacco consumption. The Healthcare Services Agency does not support legislation that would interfere or limit the FDA's ability to regulate tobacco products; these regulation authorities include; 1) Restricting cigarettes and smokeless tobacco retail sales to youth, 2) Restricting tobacco product advertising and marketing to youth, 3) Prohibiting reduced harm claims including \"light\", \"low,\" or \"mid\", 4) Implementing bigger, bolder warning labels for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products,S) Regulate flavored cigarettes (except menthol and tobacco flavorings), 6) 31 Requiring manufacturers who wish to market a new tobacco product to obtain a marketing order from FDA prior to marketing that new product, and 7) Overseeing registration and inspection oftobacco companies. 4. Economic Well Being As A Social Determinant of Health In addition to their focus on reducing unemployment, federal policymakers should consider the following policies to help create good jobs, build assets, and reduce inequities. The American Jobs Act: In the throes of an economic climate where joblessness persists and the costs of living are increasing, the current presidential administration has put forth a collection of policies that are intended to create much needed jobs and protect the income and assets of those currently working. The package of policies that make up the jobs act include measures that will provide: tax credits for hiring vets and long-term unemployed workers; tax cuts for business that expand their payroll by hiring new workers; extension of unemployment insurance and reform to the unemployment insurance program; a new I/Bridge to Work\" program expanding job opportunities for low-income youth and adults; direct job creation thorough infrastructure improvements and construction; and measures that will protect the jobs of America's teachers The Expansion of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TAN F): Discussion: a federally funded block grant program that allows states to create and administer their own assistance programs. TANF replaces the federal programs previously known as \"welfare,\" and enables states to offer a wide variety of social services. States can use TANF dollars in ways designed to meet any of the four purposes set out in federal law, which are to: 1/(1) provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives; (2) end the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage; (3) prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for preventing and reducing the incidence of these pregnancies; and (4) encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.\" TANF, which scheduled for reauthorization in 2010, was extended by Congress though September 30, 2011, and then once again extended (HR 2943) through December 31, 2011. We support its reauthorization and expansion of TANF, and that of any policy at the federal level, which increases the capacity of states to provide social services for low-income, working families. Quality jobs and worker mlsclassification: Rough economic times and with limited resources, employers have turned to ways that make the employment relationship more flexible, and both are increasingly relying on the rples of \"independent contractors\", as weI! as arranging part-time, temporary, and seasonal work. While increased employment opportunities can be seen as a healthy development, some of these arrangements can be a serious cause for concern. This is because tax, labor and employment law gives employers and employees incentives to create contingent relationships. The employer is relieved of having to make contributions to Social Security, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, health insurance, and can even use the misclassification as away to avoid paying minimum wage or overtime. All too often, however workers will accept these terms because it gives him or her opportunity for immediate income. Many low-wage workers have no practical choice in the matter, and the federal government loses out on what would be billions of dollars because of underpayment of taxes through the intentional misclassification of workers. The labor Department is currently working to coordinate efforts with law enforcement and the IRS, and leaders from 7 states recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the department's Wage and Hour Division as a coordinated step to increase accountability across sectors and jurisdiction for the misclassification of workers. California is not one of those states. Therefore, any effort by the state to involve themselves in this coordinated effort, or any measure to step beyond an MOU to codify and regulate such abuse should be strongly supported for its economic, health, and healthcare benefits. 32 Policies that support asset-building: Financial security today depends not just on job security but increasingly on one's ability to accumulate assets, both personal and financial. Broadening savings and asset ownership opportunities has the potential to improve the health of Alameda County's residents. Help low-income people to accumulate assets through increased savings and investments: The federal government should engage in the same sort of policy making at the national level as described for the state level. For instance, IDAs are matched savings accounts that help people with modest means to save towards the purchase of a lifelong asset. Typically, IDA savings and match money can be used to buy a house, pay for education or job training, or start a small business. Federal policies that fund IDAs have helped create accounts for thousands of low-income families across the country and many more could benefit from such an opportunity if additional resources were made available. The Department of Health and Human Services currently funds the majority of IDAs through Assets for Independence (AFIJ. a competitive grant program administered by the Office of Community Services (OCS). Increase affordability of post-secondary education and provide debt management assistance: Education is a strong predictor of one's ability to accumulate income and wealth, and is thereby strongly correlated to health. Because student aid and family incomes have not risen at the same rates as tuition, the dream of education has become more of a challenge in recent years. Policies at the federal level that remove barriers to educational opportunities should be supported, especially those that reduce the burden of debt felt by many residents who pursue such opportunities but are then encumbered by debt in a way that negates the positive wealth potential provided by continuing education. Some policy solutions include permanently instating The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTe) which provides a credit of up to $2,500 per year for tuition, fees, books and supplies, and is partially refundable so students and families with low-incomes can benefit, as well as increasing access to Income-Based Repayment for federal student loans, encouraging community colleges to participate in the federal loan program, expanding loan forgiveness programs, and strengthening consumer protections for private student loan borrowers. Foreclosure prevention and loan modification assistance: As referenced in an ever-growing body of literature, which includes ACPHD's own \"Rebuilding Neighborhoods, Restoring Health: A Report on the Impact of Foreclosures on Health\", the ongoing foreclosure crisis has inflicted long-term damage to the economic well\u00ad being and health of communities across the nation. In light of this large-scale distress, the current presidential administration has enacted a number of programs, as part of the larger \"Making Home Affordable\" program, with the intention of providing homeowners some relief from the perils of unsustainable loan terms and helping families avoid foreclosure. These include: Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) -designed to help homeowne rsand service rsavoidfareelosurebymod long-term; Home Afforda ble Refina nee Progra m (HARP), a rate-lowering initiative intended for borrowers whose loans were backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and who were cu rrent on their payments, but did n't have enough eq uity to refinance; Home Afforda ble Foreclosures Alternative program (HAFA), which provides alternatives to costly foreclosures and offers options and incentives to borrowers, servieers and investors who utilize a short sale or deed-in-Iieu (OIL) to avoid foreclosures; and the \"Emergency Homeowners' loan Program\" --specifically aimed at underemployed Americans --those who are struggling to keep their homes because they lost their jobs or are forced to work part time. However, despite these attempts to provide solutions and alternatives for qualifying homeowners facing foreclosure, each of these programs has only reached a small portion of its goals; one program left about half of its allotment ($1 billion) unspent before its sunset, and two other programs listed above have currently reached less than a quarter of the homeowners it had originally set as a target. Therefore, any measure to improve upon the programs listed and capture more of those homeowners in need of assistance should be fully supported. This may be accomplished through programmatic changes that remove barriers to participation, make the 33 process by which these resources are accessed less complicated, expand qualification criteria to include more homeowners, and better equip participating agencies to handle the intake and approval process. Policies to ensure equitable taxation: According to the Corporation for Enterprise Development, in FY2009, $384 billion was spent to help Americans save and invest. However, they report that at least 90 percent of related policies operate as tax expenditures, which are regressive, invisible and unregulated, and as such are of little help to low- and moderate\u00ad income households trying to become more financially secure. The CED also cited in a recent report that more than half the benefits went to the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers in fiscal year 2009, and largely missed the asset-poor majority in this country. Meaningful incentives to save for residents of all income groups should be provided, and the tax system should benefit all residents equally. Reduce tax burden on lowest income earners: Increasing federal budget deficits and skyrocketing debt has made it necessary for federal level reform in order to close the gap or suffer the consequences of increasing national economic instability. Tax cuts implemented in our previous president's administration are set to end in 2012 and the proposed reform to tax codes is one way to address inequitable income tax payment. The American Jobs Act of 2011 proposes to help reduce unemployment, and would temporarily cut individual and business taxes to promote job growth. However, it would also permanently raise taxes on high-income individuals, limit deductions for wealthier filers, target tax loopholes, end some corporate tax breaks and subsidies used by large corporations, and would spare retirees from any changes in Social Security while directing most of the cuts in Medicare spending to health care providers instead of beneficiaries. Reform the tal( code: Close loopholes that allow individuals and corporations to avoid paying their share of taxes. 34 Priority Projects \\2012 Priority Projects 35 Priority Projects 2012 Although earmarks have been eliminated in the nih Congress, the Public Works Agency (PWA) continues to support funding requests for specific flood control and transportation priorities. PWA will work with the Department of Transportation and Army Corps of Engineers for competitive grant opportunities, and formula funding for the following projects: 1. Estudillo Canal Flood Control (Feasibility Study) Project -San leandro ($1,100,000) The United States Army Corps Engineer's (USACE) Reconnaissance Study phase was completed in October 2004. The project is currently in the beginning of the seventh fiscal year (2011-12) of the Feasibility Study phase. The primary objective of the Feasibility Study is to determine the extent of Federal interest in providing flood damage reduction in the study area. USACE received a $750,000 federal appropriation for fiscal year 2005-06; $600,000 for fiscal year 2006-07; $392,000 for fiscal year 2007-08; $96,000 for fiscal year 2008-09; $250,000 for fiscal year and $0 for fiscal year 2010-11. USACE requires $1,100,000 more in federal funds to complete the Study. Benefit of Study and Construction of Improvements; Minimize property damages in the community and disruption to daily lives of the residents; Provide increased flood protection to approximately 1,800 residential properties in City of San Leandro; and, Enable the Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District to submit to FEMA a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) application to remove the FEMA 100-year flood plain designation in the study area. 2. WRDA Authorization for the San lorenzo Creek Flood Damage Reduction and Restoration Project ($500,000) The Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (District) is making an initial request for $500,000 to begin preliminary engineering for San Lorenzo Creek improvements to provide flood protection when Congress reauthorizes the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). The WRDA funding request for $500,000 will begin preliminary engineering for a project to implement improvements which will provide increased flood protection to contain the updated lOO-year design flow within San Lorenzo Creek, reduce potential for future flooding, enable the District to apply to FEMA with a Letter of Map Revision to remove the 100-year floodplain designation, and eliminate the mandatory requirement to purchase flood insurance for affected residents. There are approximately 2500 parcels that are located in the new FEMA high hazard flood zone. Proposed improvements include: raising the Don Castro Dam 5 feet, modifying the outfall structure, de-silting at Don Castro Reservoir at the upstream end, and constructing floodwalls along the downstream of San Lorenzo Creek. The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a Resolution to initiate a re-study of this area through the USACE. The Resolution was adopted on September 24, 2008 by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the United States House of Representatives. The resolution recommended that the Secretary of the Army review the report of the Chief Engineers on San Lorenzo Creek, California and other pertinent reports to determine whether any modifications of the recommendations are advisable at the present time in the interest of flood damage reduction and other allied purposes in San Lorenzo Creek, Alameda County, California. The USACE has indicated that jf federal funding was available, the Corps could conduct an assessment of the problems and prepare a Project Management Plan and Feasibility Cost Sharing Agreement. An initial funding request of $500,000 could begin the preliminary studies discussed by the USACE, above. 36 _________________ Priority Projects 12012 3, Crow canyon Road Safety Improvement Project ($11.8M) Crow Canyon Road is a two-lane major regional route between Contra Costa County and Alameda County and carries approximately 25,000 vehicles per day. Because there is a significant travel time savings by using Crow Canyon Road instead of 1-680 and 1-580 during commute hours when the freeways are congested, many commuters choose Crow Canyon Road as their commute alternative. Crow Canyon Road was not designed to carry this high volume of traffic at freeway speeds. As a result, there have been numerous collisions on the roadway. There is one location on Crow Canyon Road which the County has targeted for realignment due to the number of collisions related to the sharp curvature of the roadway. Major engineering improvements are required to address long-term safety issues on this roadway for both commuters and residents along Crow Canyon Road between Castro Valley and San Ramon. The estimated total cost to realign this curve to improve traffic safety is $ 15,400,000. The total federal revenue needed for completion of this project is $11,800/000. The County continues to seek State STIP funding for this project but state STIP funds are likely to be extremely scarce for several years. The County is advancing the design of the project using local funds and will be seeking federal monies for construction. This funding strategy will allow the County to advance the project and have it ready for construction when revenues become available. The County has completed a corridor study and preliminary environmental studies and is proceeding with, preliminary engineering. Implementing safety changes along Crow Canyon Road will help small and big businesses thrive because they rely on this route as a link between Castro Valley and San Ramon for goods and commercial products. Safety measures would provide a safer route for trucks and commercial motorists by providing the quality of driving necessary to deliver on time, saving money for the company, allowing for expansion and growth. Funding and implementation of this project will contribute to improving the economic vitality of the Bay Area by providing employment in construction jobs, and improving access and encouraging businesses to expand in the Bay Area. Additionally, the improved roadway will relieve traffic congestion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions resulting from idling cars. 4. East lewelling Boulevard Circulation and Streetscape Improvement Project Phase II ($10.2 M) East Lewelling Boulevard is an arterial roadway that connects major com mercial corridors on both Hesperia n Boulevard and Mission Boulevard. This roadway has significant traffiC congestion/ a lack of sidewalks, and requires safety improvements for pedestrians/ bicyclists/ and motorists. Phase I of the project between Hesperian Boulevard and Meekland Avenue is currently under construction, Alameda County wants to proceed with the Design, Environmental clearance, and right-of-way acquisition for Phase II (estimated project costs: $lM Design/Environmental and $3.5M for right-of-way) to be ready for construction when funds become available. The East Lewelling Boulevard Safety and Streetscape Improvement Project (Phase II) is located along East Lewelling Boulevard between East 14th Street and Meekland Avenue. This project extends the improvements currently being implemented along East Lewelling Boulevard corridor. Phase II of this project will install new sidewalks, bicycle lanes, street lighting, and landscaping along the remaining length of the project. Once funding is secured/ the project can be advertised in 36 to 42 months. Funding and implementation of this phase of the project will contribute to imprOVing the economic vitality of the Bay Area by providing employment in construction jobs, improving access for goods movement. The revitalized roadway and aesthetics encourage businesses to expand into the Lewelling Boulevard area. Additionally, the 37 Priority Projects 2012 improved sidewalks will promote walkable communities and encourage pedestrians and bicyclists to use the new facilities as tra nsportation alternatives. 5. School Area Sidewalk and Safety Projects ($14.1M) The unincorporated areas of Alameda County have over $400 million in needed sidewalk improvements to address community and pedestrian safety, especially near schools. Using factors such as school proximity, high pedestrian generators, and accident history with the ultimate goal of improving safety conditions for pedestrians and children surrounding school areas, the County's prioritized list of sidewalk projects currently includes Hillside Elementary School, Ashland; Castro Valley Elementary, Castro Valley; Fairview Elementary School, Fairview; Grant Elementary, San Lorenzo; and Sunol Glen Elementary School, Sunol. The County has initiated sidewalk projects immediately adjacent to schools that have been constructed or are under design. While these projects have provided sidewalks so that school children do not have to walk in the street, there are still many routes without sidewalks where children must walk in the street to avoid parked cars or puddles. Sidewalk projects may be divided into smaller segments, and designed and constructed as funding is made available. The County's priority remains providing safe and walkable access for children on the way to and from school, access to transit to encourage use of public transportation alternatives, and walkable neighborhoods for seniors. These sidewalk projects are supported by U.s. Congresswoman Barbara Lee, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, the Alameda County Public Health Department, the Safe Routes to School Program, the Alameda County Sheriffs Department, the California Highway Patrol (CHP), numerous schools districts and PTA's, and the Alameda County Transportation Commission (Alameda CTC). These sidewalk projects will continue to contribute to improving the economic vitality of the Bay Area by providing employment in construction jobs while improving access for pedestrians and bicyclists in the areas surrounding the schools. 6. Vasco Road Project -Phase 11 ($20M) Vasco Road is a regional arterial roadway that has become the primary access between residences in the southern portion of eastern Contra Costa County and eastern Alameda County. Vasco Road is a major commute corridor, connecting affordable housing in eastern Contra Costa County to employment centers in Alameda County, Contra Costa County, Santa Clara County, San Joaquin County, and the Bay Area as a whole. Alameda County has made a strong effort to reduce the number of collisions on Vasco Road, but there remains a need for increased safety improvements. Phase I of the Vasco Road Safety Improvements Project was completed in 2010 and included roadway realignment, median barrier construction, and the addition of climbing lanes and bicycle lanes. Contra Costa County is currently implementing similar roadway improvements on portions of Vasco Road within Contra Costa County. This project will extend Phase I improvements to the urban interface at the City of Livermore. Phase II of the Vasco Road Safety Improvement Project will improve safety and prevent severe collisions by realigning the roadway and installing a concrete median barrier for an approximate project length of 1.9 miles to further protect motorists from crossover head-on collisions on the remaining portions of Vasco Road. Funding for this phase will facilitate completing the overall project. The Vasco Road Safety Improvement Project, Phase II, contributes to improving the economic vitality of the Bay Area by providing employment in construction jobs, improving access and encouraging tourism to the 38 Priority Projects 12012 livermore/Pleasanton area, and improving access and encouraging businesses to expand in the Bay Area. The project provides connection to several wineries in the City of Livermore. The project also provides access to Pacific Gas and Electric Wind Power Energy along Vasco Road. Safety improvements along Vasco Road continue to be supported by Contra Costa County, the California Highway Patrol (CHP), the Alameda County Transportation Commission (ALAMEDA CTC), the Cities of Livermore and Brentwood, the Tri-Valley Transportation Council, and the Vasco Road Safety Committee. Funding and implementation of this project will contribute to improving the economic vitality of the Bay Area by providing employment in construction jobs, improving access and encouraging tourism to the livermore/Pleasanton area, and improving access and encouraging businesses to expand in the Bay Area. The project will also promote green energy, agriculture, and green jobs. Vasco Road provides access to many agricultural farms and Pacific Gas and Electric wind power. The roadway improvements will provide infrastructure for future expansion of green energy production and job creation. 7. Castro Valley Boulevard Pedestrian Enhancement Project ($lOM) The Castro Valley Downtown Area Strategic Plan identifies roadway, sidewalk, and streetscape improvements are necessary to transform the Castro Valley downtown area into a safe pedestrian oriented retail area. Castro Valley Boulevard is a major arterial roadway serving the primary commercial district in Castro Valley. Implementation of the needed transportation and streetscape improvements will allow Castro Valley Boulevard to carry the traffic loads it was meant to facilitate while also creating a safe, walkable, pedestrian-oriented environment. This project would include sidewalk improvements, bulb-out and crosswalk improvements, median island improvements, landscaping, streetscaping, street lighting, and roadway and drainage improvements. With funding, another phase of the project design could be advanced and ready for construction as early as 2014. This project is part of the Castro Va lIey Downtown Streetscape Master Plan and is a high priority for the Castro Valley community for revitalizing the downtown commercial business district. Funding and implementation of this project will contribute to improving the economic vitality of Castro Valley by providing a variety of employment opportunities and encouraging businesses to expand in the area. 8. East 14th/Mission Boulevard Revitalization Project Phase III (SUM) East 14th Street/Mission Boulevard is a high priority redevelopment project for the Ashland and Cherryland areas of unincorporated Alameda County. The Ashland and Cherryland areas are economically challenged communities served by the retail corridor of East 14th Street/Mission Boulevard. Revitalization of this retail corridor will stimulate the area by attracting new businesses and lead the way to regeneration of the entire area. Phase one of three has been constructed and has made a significant area improvement. Phase II is currently under design. However, design and construction funding for Phase III is lacking. The Public Works Agency will continue to work with the Alameda County Redevelopment Agency and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to advance this project. 39 Priority Projects 12012 Funding and implementation of this project will contribute to improving the economic vitality of Castro Valley by providing a variety of employment opportunities and encouraging businesses to expand in the area. 9. Fruitvale Bridge Lifeline Seismic Retrofit Project ($40M) As an island, the City of Alameda depends upon four bridges and two tubes for access. In the event of a catastrophic seismic event, one facility needs to be upgraded to a lifeline status so that supplies and services can be provided to the City of Alameda in case all other bridges are significantly damaged. The County wants to proceed with the Design and Environmental clearance (estimate: $3M) so that this project is construction-ready when funds become available. The County conducted a study of the estuary bridges between the Cities of Alameda and Oakland to identify the most feasible bridge for lifeline seismic retrofitting. The best candidate and most cost-effective bridge for lifeline retrofitting is the Fruitvale Avenue Bridge. The estimated cost of the project is $40M. While the feasibility study has been completed, monies for design and construction of the lifeline improvements are still required. The County will seek both (State) STiP and HBP funding for this project although the high cost of the project will make it difficult to obtain complete funding. Federal funding for this important regional project would help leverage limited local area monies for the project. With funding, the design of the project could be completed in 24 to 30 months. Funding and impiementation of this project will generate positive economic actions and growth includ ing the creation of over 1,500 job opportunities from the design and environmental phases through project completion. 10. 1-580 Corridor Improvement Projects The 1-580 corridor in the Tri-Valley is one of the most traffic congested in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area region. It serves as a key inter-regional gateway between the Bay Area and the Central Valley for goods movement and commute workforce travel. This chronic condition has resulted in 1-580's designation in the top five most congested Bay Area corridors identified in the annual report jointly published by Caltrans and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). This congestion will worsen as traffic volumes in this corridor are projected to increase 90 percent by 2030. To respond to the existing and projected congestion, the Alameda County Transportation Commission (Alameda CTC) has identified a series of planned improvements for this corridor. Over the past two years, completed improvements within the 1-580 corridor included the implementation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in 2009, and the completion of eastbound HOV lanes in December, 2010. Remaining planned 1-580 corridor improvements include building a new interchange at Isabel Avenue, reconstruction of the existing 1-580/1-680 interchange, HOT (express) lane conversions in both eastbound and westbound directions, auxiliary lane construction with HOV/HOT (express) lanes and interchange projects, and eastbound truck climbing lanes. Complementing the highway projects is right-of-way preservation for BART's adopted alignment with a two-station extension in the Livermore downtown area and Vasco Road with a cost estimate of $3.8 billion. The Public Works Agency continues its support of the ongoing funding for the 1-580 Corridor improvement projects. 40 Priority Proj=.cts 12012 11. Union Pacific (Oakland Subdivision) Railroad Corridor Improvement Plan ($36,550,000) A Union Pacific (Oakland Subdivision) Railroad Corridor Improvement Study was recently completed to develop and examine future transportation alternatives along the Union Pacific Railroad Corridor between the Fruitvale BART station in Oakland and the Union City BART station in Union City. The Corridor is approximately 15 miles long. The Union Pacific (Oakland Subdivision) Railroad Corridor Improvement Project will provide future transportation alternatives (pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and rail) along the Corridor between the Fruitvale BART station in Oakland and the Union City BART station in Union City. This project provides opportunity to convert the railway corridor into a multi-use access that benefits area residents and enhances transportation options for local communities. The estimated total project cost is $102.SM. By maximizing existing funding opportunities, a shortfall of $36.55M remains to complete the funding plan and leverage other available funding sources. The Alameda County Public Works Agency, Alameda County Transportation Commission (Alameda CTC), San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) and the Cities of Oakland, San Leandro, Hayward, and Union City are closely working in consortium to improve transportation access along this Corridor.
