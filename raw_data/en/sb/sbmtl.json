Through this partnership, Healthier Middlesex is able to provide its community with the best programs and policies available. Healthier Middlesex constantly strives to develop more effective strategies to positively impact the health of the community. The Consortium i s focused on identifying the strengths and opportunities within the community, aligning the efforts and resources of its partners, while developing structure and sustainable strategies that integrate health and wellness into all aspects of its community. Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH ) and Saint Peter's University Hospital (SPUH) are founding members of the Consortium and provide sponsorship for the development of the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) . The CHNA is designed to ensure that the Hospitals and other community stakeholders continue to effectively and efficiently serve the health needs of its service area. The CHNA was developed in accordance with all federal rules and statues, specifically, PL 111 -148 (the Affordable Care Act) which added Section 501(r) to the Internal Revenue Code , and in accordance with New Jersey regulations 8:52 -10.1 -10.3 governing local boards of health . The Middlesex County Needs Assessment was undertaken in this context and developed for the purpose of enhancing health and quality of life throughout the community. This assessment builds upon the CHNA completed in 2016. The 2016 Implementation Plan results are reviewed in Appendix A . The CHNA uses detailed secondary public health data at state, count y, and community levels, a community health survey, and focus groups with other community stakeholders. Healthier Middlesex convenes a multi -disciplinary, multi -facility Steering Committee that provides additional support and leadership to identify health assets, gaps, disparities, trends, and priorities. The Methodology section details the data collection process and analysis. ES-2 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex Service Area The CHNA focuses primarily on the health needs of Middlesex County residents. Much of the secondary data is provided at the county level, but where available, city or zip code level data are provided to enhance the understanding of specific regions or pop ulations. RWJUH and SPUH are both located in New Brunswick. They are two of five hospitals serving residents of Middlesex County. The RWJUH/SPUH Primary Service Area (PSA) consist of the zip codes to the right. The service area is determined by conside ring three factors: patient origin, reliance on the Hospital (market share ), and geographic continuity and proximity. Zip codes representing approximately 50% of the RWJUH/SPUH patient origin form the initial primary service area (PSA); any zip code in wh ich the Hospital s have a high market share presence is also included. Zip codes with low er market share are deleted from the PSA definition and included in the secondary service area (SSA). Geographic proximity is used to create a contiguous area and compl etes the service area determination. RWJUH/SPUH 's PSA is predominantly located in t he western half of Middlesex County. For purposes of this assessment, Middlesex County was selected to best represent communities they serve in reviewing secondary data sour ces presented at the county level . Middlesex County encompasses a land mass of 323 square miles comprised of 2 5 urban and suburban municipalities. The county's municipalities are diverse, encompassing inner -city communities, such as New Brunswick and Perth Amboy , and the suburban communities of Plainsboro, Cranbury and Monroe Township . Economic wealth is not uniformly distributed across municipalities ; urban areas include a high number of poor and minority populations. RWJUH and SPUH , located in New Br unswick , are two of five acute care hospitals operating in Middlesex County. Middlesex County has a larger proportion of African -American and Hispanic/Latino residents than New Jersey.2 o Middlesex County's population is 9.6% African -American, compared to 12.8 % statewide. o Middlesex County's population is 2 1.3% Hispanic/Latino, compared to 20.7 % statewide . o Middlesex County's population is 41.8% White, compared to 54.4 % statewide. In 201 6, 8.9% of people and 6.5% of Middlesex County families were living in poverty compared to 10.9% of people and 8.1% of families statewide. o In 201 6, 36.0 % of people and 28.9 % of families were living in poverty in New Brunswick . o In 201 6, 8.4% of families were living in poverty in the Highland P ark zip code. In 2016, 4.6% of Middlesex County residents were unemployed, lowe r than the State ( 5.2%). o The unemployment rate in New Brunswick (5.4%) exceeded the county rate ( 4.6%) and was higher than the State rate (5.2%). o The Monroe unemployment rate was 3.4%, the lowest in the service area and lower than the Middlesex County rate of 4.6%. 2 United States Census Bureau American Community Survey 2014 RWJUH /SPUH Primary Service Area ZIP Code ZIP Name 08816 East Brunswick 08817 Edison 08831 Monroe Township 08854 Piscataway 08873 Somerset 08901 New Brunswick 08902 North Brunswick 08904 Highland Park ES-3 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex In 2016, the Middlesex County median household income was $ 80,716 , more than $ 7,000 above the State average.3 o The 2016 median household income of New Brunswick residents ($ 40,428 ) was a little more than half the statewide figure ($73,702).4 o East Brunswick had the highest median household income in the RWJUH /SPUH Service Area at $ 101,245 . o Between 2014 -2016, income levels across the county and the RWJUH /SPUH Service Area showed little increase or decline. TOP HEALTH ISSUES Healthier Middlesex determined issues to be within the RWJBH/SPUH's purview, competency and resources to impact in a meaningful manner . These issues include: Access to Care and Services Transportation, Insurance , Availability of Services Behavioral/Mental Health/Substance Abuse Use o Trauma Informed Care Youth Services Preventative Care and Vaccination Use Chronic Diseases prevention and management (various, heart disease, diabetes, cancer) STI prevention/screening Vaccination Use Maternal Child Health/Prenatal Care and Well Baby Nutrition and Physical Activity Food Security Obesity The CHNA uses detailed secondary public health data at s tate, county, and community levels , from various sources including Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Census Bureau, Healthy People 2020 , the County Health Rankings, and hospital discharge data, to name a few. Healthy People 2020 is a 10 -year agenda to improve the nation's health that encompasses the entire continuum of prevention and care. For over three decades Healthy People has established benchmarks and monitored progress over time to measure the impa ct of prevention activities. Healthy People 2020 benchmarks are used throughout the report to assess the health status of residents. The County Health Rankings, published by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johns on Foundation, rank the health of nearly all counties in the United States. The rankings look at a variety of measures that affect health such as high school graduation rates, air pollution levels, income, rates of obesity and smoking, etc. These ranking s are also used throughout the report to measure the overall health of Middlesex County residents. County rates are also compared to statewide rates. 3 United States Census Bureau 2014 4 United States Census Bureau American Community Survey 2014 ES-4 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex The Healthier Middlesex needs assessment was developed for the purpose of enhancing the health and quality of life throughout the community. To this end, both internal and external data were used to understand recent health indicators and opportunities to provide a positive impact on health and wellness. Other significant needs determined by this CHNA in clude: Heart Disease Cancer High Crime Rates/Safety Cost/Insurance Limited English Proficiency Community Outreach (Awareness of Services) Cultural Awareness 1. Access to Healthcare Costs, culture and education are three main barriers to healthcare access. The Office of Minority Health's \"National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health Care\" (CLAS), defines full access as care that \"recognizes and responds to health -related beliefs and cultural values, disease incidence an d prevalence, and treatment efficacy.\"5 In order to achieve optimal access, effective patient communication is essential. Language differences, diverse cultures, and low health literacy are barriers to high quality care. Linguistic skill, cultural norms an d health literacy strategies are integral to ensure a quality patient care plan. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation identified five barriers to healthcare access including: affordability (patients do not have enough money to get care), accommodation (pat ients are too busy to get care), availability (patients could not get an appointment soon enough), accessibility (patients took too long to get to the doctor's office or clinic), and acceptability (doctor or hospital wouldn't accept patient's health insura nce).6 Healthier Middlesex is sensitive to these barriers and strives to ensure patient access to quality care by addressing low health literacy, cultural differences, and limited English proficiency. Other barriers include lack of transportation or resou rces to pay transportation costs. In addition, barriers to specific types of services including mental health and substance abuse services were often mentioned in surveys and in focus groups. Barriers to the receipt of these services include provider sho rtages, insurance coverage and costs, stigma, and the availability and use of trauma -informed care. While adolescents are generally healthy, the teen years do present a variety of health challenges, mostly due to risk taking behaviors of teens related to vaping, alcohol, drug use, sex, violence, bullying, suicide and motor vehicle use. In an increasing ly complex and social media -oriented society , giving teens the skills they need to navigate these challenges is critically important. In 201 6, 11.0 % of Middlesex County residents did not graduate high school, 0.1 percentage points lower than New Jersey.7 5 Office of Minority Health Nat ional Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health Care http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/assets/pdf/checked/finalreport.pdf 6 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: Barriers to Access http://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2012/02/spe -to-care -for-us-adults.html 7 United States Census Bureau American Community Survey 2016 ES-5 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex o In 201 6, 39.4 % of New Brunswick residents did not complete high school, more than the county (11.0%) and higher than state rate (11.1%). o In 201 6, 4.2% of Highland Park residents did not complete high school, lowest in the region. In 201 6, the percentage of Limited English Proficiency (LEP) households in New Brunswick (36.7%) was higher than New Jersey ( 12.2%) and Middlesex County ( 16.4 %). In 201 6, 27.2 % of Somerset 's population was African -American, higher than 9.6% in Middlesex County. o In 201 8, 41.1 % of the Edison 's population was Asian , higher than the 9.9% in New Jersey. o In 201 8, 54.2% of the New Brunswick population was Hispanic/Latino, higher than 21.3% in Middlesex County. 2. Prevention/Screening and Vaccine Use Clinical preventive services occupy an important position within the realm of interventions designed to prevent, forestall or mitigate illness. In the U.S., recommendations for clinicians regarding delivery of clinical preventive services are issued by two indepen dent groups of experts: The Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). These entities are charged with rigorously evaluating the merits of preventive health services including immunizations an d screening tests, counseling and chemoprophylaxis. The Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF), a national independent body of public health and prevention experts, makes recommendations about public health interventions and policies to improve health and promote safety. Between them, the USPSTF and CPSTF evaluated evidence of how health can be improved by prevention in both clinical and community settings. Volumes and disease -screening services occupy an important position within the constella tion of interventions designed to prevent, forestall or mitigate illness. With the rapid increase in the number of U.S. residents 65+, this issue grows in even greater importance. With aging, the immune system can get suppressed so annual vaccinations su ch as a flu shot are a must. Other diseases such as cancer and heart disease tend to onset as people age, screenings can help to identify and treat such diseases. Disease prevention has never been more important to the health of older Americans and to th e health of the U.S. economy as it is today. A recent economic analysis concludes that the rise in health care expenditure would be moderated by significantly broadening the provision of 20 proven clinical preventive services, including screenings and vac cinations. Farley et al estimate that 50,000 - 100,000 deaths among persons aged 80 and younger could be prevented through optimal use of 9 clinical preventive services.8 However, current U.S. spending on prevention accounts for only 2 -3% of health care expenditures; with the overwhelming portion of financial outlays covering hospitals, physician services, pharmaceutical services and administrative costs.9 Improving the health and well -being of pregnant women, infants and children is an important public health goal for our county. Their well -being determines the health of the next generation and can help predict the future public health challenges for families, communities and the health care system. Pregnancy can provide an opportunity for early identi fication of existing health risks in women and prevent future health problems for women and their children. 8 Farley T.

ES-6 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex Environmental and social factors such as access to health care and early intervention of services, educational, employment, economic opportunities, social support and availability of resources are the key social determinants that influence health behaviors and status. In 2016, a lower percentage of Middlesex County adults over age 50 ( 62.4%) participated in colo -rectal screening than adults statewid e (65.1%). 84.5 % of Middlesex County 's 1st grade students received all required immunizations, comp ared to the statewide percentage (9 2.7%). In 2016, the percent of Middlesex County adults who received a flu shot ( 67.0%) was lower than the Healthy People 2020 target of 90%. The percent of Middlesex County adults ( 74.7 %) who had a pneumonia vaccine is higher than the statewide rate (66.5%). 3. Nutrition and Food Security Good nutrition, physical activity and a healthy body weight are essential to overall health and well -being. Food security and the environmental factors that are involved in safe, healthy communities play an important part in ensuring that basic needs are available to support healthy nutrition and physical activity. Poor nutrition and a lack of a healthy diet pattern, and regular physical activity, are health behaviors that contribute to obesity. A healthy diet pattern is one that emphasizes eating whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, low fat and fat -free dairy products, and drinking water. Healthy activity patterns include 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity or a combination of both, along with two day s of weight training per week. Being overweight or obese can have a serious impact on health. Overweight and obesity are risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including: cardiovascular disease (mainly heart disease and stroke), Type 2 diabetes, m usculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis, and some cancers (endometrial, breast and colon). These conditions cause premature death and disability. Onset of increased risk begins when someone is only slightly overweight, and the risk increases as weight rises. Many conditions cause long - term consequences for individuals and families. In addition, the costs of care are high. Prevention and wellness programs are necessary to address the insidious effects of excess weight. Approximately 39.8% of the U.S. p opulation, or 93.3 million adults, are affected by obesity according to the 2015 -2016 National Center for Health Statistics data brief. But some groups are disproportionately impacted. For example, Hispanics (47%), non -Hispanic Blacks (46.85) had the hig hest age -adjusted prevalence of obesity followed by non -Hispanic Whites (37.9%) and non -Hispanic Asians (12.7%). The association between obesity and income or education level is complex and differs by age, sex and ethnicity. Overall, men and women with c ollege degrees had lower obesity prevalence compared to those with less education. By race/ethnicity, the same obesity and education pattern was seen among non -Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic women, and also among non -Hispanic White men, a lthough the differences were not all statistically significant. Although the difference was not statistically significant among non -Hispanic Black men, obesity prevalence increased with educational attainment. Among non -Hispanic Asian women and men, and Hispanic men there were no differences in obesity prevalence by education level. ES-7 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex Among men, obesity prevalence was lower in the lowest and highest income groups compared with the middle -income group. This pattern was seen among non -Hispanic White and Hisp anic men. Obesity prevalence was higher in the highest income group than in the lowest income group among non -Hispanic Black men. Among women, obesity prevalence was lower in the highest income group than in the middle - and lowest -income groups. This pat tern was observed among non -Hispanic White, non -Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic women. Among non -Hispanic Black women, there was no difference in obesity prevalence by income.10 Obesity can occur at any age, even among young children. Hormonal changes and ph ysical inactivity in older individuals also increase risk. The amount of body muscle decreases with age, leading to a decrease in metabolism. Quitting smoking is also associated with weight gain, sometimes resulting in obesity. Structured smoking cessation programs can help mitigate the effects of weight gain associated with quitting. Not getting enough sleep or conversely getting too much sleep can cause changes in the hormones that increase appetite and contribute to weight gain. Nearly 2 8% of Middlesex residents reported a BMI >=30 in 2016. 11.3/1,000 patients who used a hospital service in Middlesex County had a diagnosis of obesity compared to 14.1/1,000 New Jersey residents. Obesity rates among hospitalized patients were found to be amongst the highe st in Monroe and Somerset (13.55 /1,000) . Between 2014 -2016 the percent of Middlesex County residents reporting no leisure time activity trended upwards from 26.2 % in 2014 to 2 9.5% in 2016. Nearly half of all survey respondents claimed to have or to have a family member with hypertension, high cholesterol or a weight problem. Obesity was the number 1 concern among survey respondents from Middlesex County. 46% of survey residents indicating obesity said they or a family member were under a physician's care for the issue, while 3 0% were monitoring it on their own. 10 https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html 1 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex 1.

METHODOLOGY/SERVICE AREA A. METHODOLOGY Healthier Middlesex developed an evidenced -based process to determine the health needs of Middlesex County residents. CHNA data sources include both primary and secondary data to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the communities. Data from these sources were reviewed the Steering Committee to identify and prioritize the top issues facing residents in the service area (see Top Health Issues section). The flow chart below identifies the CHNA and implementation planning process employed. Prioritization Process Following the Steering Committee's review of quantitative and qualitative data on July 31, 2019, a list of 17 issues were identified by consultants as common themes of the research. These included: Access to Care Heart Disease Cancer Behavioral/Mental Health Behavioral health in Youth an d Adolescents Diabetes Substance Abuse/Opioid Crisis Physical Activity/Obesity Food Security/Nutrition Cost/Insurance CommunityHealthier Middlesex Steering Committee Review of Secondary Source Data Primary Research Priority Setting and Plan DevelopmentCommunication Plan - All ConstituentsImplementationEvaluationCHNA and IMPLEMENTATION PLAN PROCESS 4 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex Limited English Proficiency Transportation Maternal and Child Health High Crime Rate/Safety Coordination and Communication Community Outre ach (Awareness) Cultural Awareness A ballot was developed, and a survey presented at a Healthier Middlesex meeting asking them to rank each issue based on the following criteria.

Interviews were conducted online and by telephone. A link to the online survey was displayed on hospital web pages and social media sites. Additionally, postcards were handed out at area businesses and libraries, directing residents to the online survey link. A telephone augment was conducted to capture additional interviews in specifi c areas and among specific ethnic groups. 5 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex Focus Group Discussions Two focus groups were undertaken to uncover additional information from key community groups and individuals with respect to health needs, challenges and barriers, and suggestions for improving access to health care services. One focus group was made up of youth counsellors, individuals, and community organizations providing services to youth and adolescents . This group was designed to uncover major issues about concerns faci ng middle and high school aged adolescents. Another group was made up of undocumented Hispanic/Latina women to discuss their health needs and the barriers they faced in accessing care, and in leading healthy lifestyles. The f ocus group report s are found in Section 4. (See Section 4) Focus group meetings were conducted on August 27th and 30th , 2019 by New Solutions, Inc . Secondary Data Sources Over 100 secondary data sources are compiled in this CHNA, presenting data by indicator by county and state. Sources include: The United States Census Bureau, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH), and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

In addition, hospital tumor registry data is utilized to understand stage of cancer at time of diagnosis. Health Profile Section 5 provides a comprehensive presentation of health outcomes as well as the social determinants of health and other health factors that contribute to the health and well -being of Middlesex County residents. Color Indicator Tables Throughout the Health Profile Section of this CHNA, the color indicator tables compare county level data to Healthy People 2020 targets, County Health Rankings benchmarks, and New Jersey State data. Data by race/ethnicity are compared to data for all race s in the county, unless otherwise indicated. Middlesex County was the midpoint value compared to a range 20% higher than the value for New Jersey, Healthy People 2020 , or County Health Rankings Benchmarks, or 20% lower than the value for New Jersey, Healt hy People 2020 , or County Health Rankings Benchmarks. If the county value was within the range 20% lower or 20% higher than the comparison indicator, or considered within reasonable range, the indicator will be yellow. The table will be red if the Middlese x County value is more than 20% worse or lower than the indicator value. If the Middlesex County value is 20% better or higher than the indicator value, the table will be green. Comparative counties are also presented providing additional context for selec t health indicators. Assets and Gaps Section 6, Assets and Gaps, summarizes the preceding components of the CHNA. Assets highlight county information indicating improvement over time, in comparison to other counties and the State, or in comparison to ot her races or genders. Gaps focus on disparities in Middlesex County or the RWJUH /SPUH 6 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex Service Area that have a negative trend, in comparison to other counties in the State or to other races or genders. Resource Inventory A service area -specific resource inventory is included as Appendix D, which details health and social service resources available to residents in Middlesex County. Providers' names, addresses, and phone numbers and type of services provided are contained in the inventory. B. SERVICE AREA The CHNA focuses primarily on the health needs of Middlesex County residents. Much of the data is provided at the county level, but where available city or zip code level data are provided to enhance understanding of sp ecific regions or populations. The county consists of the New Brunswick 08903 New Brunswick 08906 New Brunswick 08933 New Brunswick 08989 New Brunswick 08902 Spotswood 07095 Woodbridge 7 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Saint Peter's University Hospital are located in New Brunswick , New Jersey. They are two of five hospitals serving residents in Middlesex County. The RWJUH/SPUH primary service area (PSA) consists of the following zip codes: RWJUH /SPUH Service Area Map The RWJUH/SPUH Service Area is determined by taking into consideration three factors: patient origin, reliance on the Hospitals (market share ), and geographic continuity/proximity. Typically, the combined service area represents 75 - 80% of the Hospital s' patients. Zips codes represe nting approximately 50% of the RWJUH /SPUH patient origin form the initial PSA. Added to this list is any zip code in which the Hospital has a high market share presence , any zip code with low er market share is deleted from the PSA definition and becomes p art of the secondary service area (SSA) . The next range of zip codes comprise the SSA. Geographic proximity is used to create a contiguous area completes the service area determination. RWJUH /SPUH 's PSA is predominantly located in t he western portion of Middlesex County. The SSA is comprised of a number of Middlesex County zip codes and portions of Hudson and Morris Counties . For purposes of this assessment, Middlesex County was selected to best represent communities it serves in reviewing secondary data sources presented at the county level. Most of the secondary data in this report is based on county level data. City or zip code level data is provided wherever possible to enhance the understanding of the specific needs of service area residents. Data obtained from the qualitative analys es provide further insight into health issues facing the communities served by the Hospital .

FOCUS GROUP REPORTS A. YOUTH AND ADOLESCENTS On August 27, 2019, a focus group with 12 individuals representing school -aged youth and adolescents came together to discuss issues impacting their needs, barriers to care, and ideas to improve services to this group. MOST PRESSING HEALTH , BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OR SOCIAL ISSUES FACING PRE -TEENS & ADOLESCENTS There was general agreement among participants that the most pressing issues facing youth and pre - teens were mental health, social adjustment and substance use. There was an awareness that young people today were facing a different reality and were having a difficult time adjusting to the range of inputs and messaging they receive via social media on a regular basis. Another issue was the lack of coping skills displayed by youth in dealing with negative situations and their need to have tools to navigate the world they live in. Others spoke about poverty and the differences with what kids see on -line vs their own situation s. B ullying and the fact that some kid s feel that no one cares about them - that they have no value were also among the issues discussed . Others expressed the perspective that youth from other cultures have a hard time accepting their identity in an American culture . Participants also discussed social media's 24/7 influence and the inability young people have to disconnect from negative events. They also spoke of the lack of opportunities for physical activity among young people. Lastly, participants were concerned about the level of services provided in the schools to deal with students' behavioral health issues in a trauma -informed manner and the availability of social and emotional learning programs . According to most, th is seemed to be issue that w as not being addressed because of funding. \"I think social isolation, mental health . . . play a key role in children. \" \"Lack of connectedness and social media. I think it's really hard to navigate especially where brains are not fully developed .\" \"I think it's too much connectedness an d not enough. Because I think the human relationship is suffering because of social media, and I think that is something that is a game changer for the human race.\" \"We have to give them the tools they need to navigate the world they are in. Because we'r e not going to change the world . . .\" \"Well, that's over -connectedness . . . cause, in the past all of this happened before . . . the abducting, the killings, the murders. But now we're all connected. Every incident, everywhere you have the news within 20 minutes .\" \". . . the distance between what they see on screen . . . this life of abundance and everybody's so happy and the dichotomy of what I have in front of me . . .\" \". . . being considered American means that I can go further, and I can do things . I won't be judged for who I am. So, you have that lack of accepting themselves for who they are .\" \"They need a household that nurtures who they are as an individual and supports them.\" \". . . one of the things I see . . . is we don't teach them it's ok ay if you fail because you learn from that .\" 53 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex \"We need to teach kids it's okay to be sad or angry. (The issue is) how are you going to handle that and move on? \" \"The Social and Emotional piece is the buzz all over, you know, physical activity -based social and emotional wellness programs. But I think that Middlesex County is pretty diverse in a lot of ways. And there's some communities that we go into that are getting it still, I think it's not across -the- board .\" \"Teaching something like ACES (Adverse Chil dhood Education) experiences and trauma -informed care are easy and not cost -prohibitive .\" MANIFESTATIONS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES Participants were asked how the behavioral health issues they just spoke about were manifested in youth be it at school, home or in the ED. This elicited a range of behaviors including substance use (including alcohol, pills, vaping and marijuana), suicidal thoughts and actions, promiscuity, self -harming, anxiety and depression. Partic ipants were also asked if services were available to deal with adolescent mental health and substance use needs. The overwhelming response was that there were not enough services, services were often extremely expensive, and that many times kids were eval uated and then sent back to school with no or little follow -up care recommended for the student. \"Substance abuse, absolutely . . . 11 . . . they're just turning to that to numb themselves from what they are seeing and experien cing.\" \"The whole recreational legalization of marijuana, I think gives a message it's okay .\" \". . . I'm seeing a lot more girls and boys self -harming and attempting or completing suicide.\" \"I could just say in the last three years (the number of completed suicides) has dramatically increased.\" \"I think the alarming part is the behavioral health issues in elementary school. You see kids coming in and most of our referrals, 30 or 40%, are for suicidal thoughts - and we refer them out. And by the t ime they take him to the psychiatrist the behavior does not qualify for him to be admitted for treatment. Then they put him back in the school district .\" \". . . we've had some programs working with parents of children with mental health issues , what to as k, how to question. That's your child, you have every right. If you have a gut feeling, . . . you know what, go to another doctor, and don't be afraid to. \" \"We do a Pride survey every year. Middle school and high school. Last time we did it, it was vaping, marijuana, pills. Middle school reported more pill use than high school .\" \"Alcohol is number 1 .\" \"Also, you learn if you want to socialize, you want to relax, you have a drink; and you see your friends or adults drinking all the time. \" \"Well, that's the other thing, sexual promiscuity, right? So, we're finding a lot more STDs coming up in that population than there used to be .\" \"Our young boys, our young girls, it doesn't matter. They're being asked to share (naked) photos.\" \"The majority of young p eople may say it's vaping. Starting with nicotine and then transition to THC or not really knowing what they're vaping.\" \"There are 36 contracted providers (for substance abuse) under the Children's System of Care whether it's outpatient, residential or i npatient, and none are in Middlesex County.\" \"Some providers don't take Medica id, but they might take private insurance. They might do a sliding scale.\" \"So, they might do mental health and not do substance abuse.\" 54 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex AWARENESS OF THE HEALTH AFFECTS OF VAPI NG Most felt that kids even if they knew vaping contains nicotine believe d that vaping was a safe alternative to smoking and were highly influenced by advertising and marketing. \"Some of them know it's nicotine . . . if they think it's flavoring and water, it's not harmful. It's safer than cigarettes .\" \"I have parents who come to my presentation who say, 'I buy it for my kid. I thought it was flavoring. I go to vape shops.' \" \"JUUL had a prevention program . . . they were telling them (students) tha t it's safe , that nicotine levels are low. I compared marketing back from the '80s to vape. It's the same. The only difference is it's more colorful and the models are skinnier.\" DO ADOLESCENTS ENGAGE IN HEALTHY LIVING PRACTICES? Many felt that the extent to which young people make healthy choices about eating and exercise had a lot to do with income levels, where they lived, their access to healthy foods , and to neighborhoods that were safe and provided outside spaces for exercise . \"Exercise I found . . . in certain communities is not part of the culture. They look at us like we have two heads. Why would we want to run and what's that going to get us? \" \"You know you buy fresh fruits and vegetables, if you don't eat it, it goes b ad. And, so, I think too it's about education on buying. If you buy rice and beans, you can still prepare it in a healthy way .\" \"They've (schools) been changing and getting better in that area (offering healthy choices). What's healthy to a kid though?\" \"I was in a school . . . and they had Mountain Dew Kickstarter in their vending machine. Red Bull in the vending machine in the cafeteria.\" WHAT CAN BE DONE TO COUNTERACT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES FACING YOUNG PEOPLE? Participants agreed that the b ehaviors exhibited by young people were outcomes of deeper -rooted issues, some of which were impacted by social determinants of health and that the response had to fit the community . Participants agreed that messaging needed to be directed to and specific to the various communities in the county. It was suggested that within the urban areas the focus might be a more family - centered approach while in suburban areas an approach based on empowerment might be more successful. Participants also believe that sc hools have a vital part to play in ensuring children feel safe, cared for, and had the tools and developmental skills they need to deal with and navigate their environment. Many felt that the school s lack a sufficient number of social workers or clinical therapists to deal with the mental health issues facing students and their parents. \"I think it goes back to having more social workers in the schools .\" \"Unfortunately, there is no one right way to do it. Every neighborhood is going to be different .\" \"I think it's a comprehensive approach between school, home and community, round tables like this. Everybody getting on the same page and saying, I think the first thing is identifying the issues 55 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex and problems and then figuring out what are the best practic es and the best way to deal with these problems. \" \"We need to take away the stigma .\" \"Normalize it (mental health). Create what we'll call a mental health call that you have in every school .\" \"There are a lot of physicians in my area that are adding socia l workers to work collaboratively .\" B. HISPANICS/LATINAS UNDOCUMENTED On August 30, 2019, a focus group was held at RWJ Fitness & Wellness Center with 10 community members representing the undocumented community. Participants were asked about issues imp acting their health, barriers to care, health and mental health needs and suggestions for improving access to care. The group was conducted in Spanish and made use of an on -site translator. This ensured that respondents felt comfortable and were able to sp eak in a language most familiar to them. MOST PRESSING HEALTH & MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES When asked about the most pressing health or mental health issues facing the community, most comments were about the insufficiency of current services and the fact that there were not enough services to meet the demand. Services were also deemed to be very expensive for people who were undocumented or had no health insurance. Commenters felt that if care was delivered in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner and in line with the educational level of patients, patients would present at an earli er stage of disease, would use the ED to a lesser degree and the community would be healthier. Participants related stories of their and other's experiences in which they felt intimidated, didn't get to ask questions or felt dismissed and left the clini c feeling they did not have adequate information. In some cases, respondents said they would not go back. Others were humiliated in front of other patients, had their concerns dismissed or believed they were being given unnecessary treatment but felt at a loss to complain or question. \"Even though we have some services at the local clinic, it's not enough; it's very expensive for people who are undocumented or have no insurance.\" \"Sometime s the diagnosis is not on time or appropriate, so the treatment is not appropriate.\" \"...Something that would promote better health or at leas t be more compassionate care , is having staff that are friendly, because some staff (at centers) are intimidating for a lot of very humble people that don't have a lot of education a nd they're very intimidated...they (staff) come off very aggressive to patients.\" \"You feel bad; you need to go; you go but then the treatment that you get; you don't want to come back. Especially the men they're not going to go because...there's no explanatio n...\" \"The environment is that they let you go (leave) and make you feel like you don't deserve to know.\" \"So many times, we see that the relationship with the medical field (breaks down) that families prefer to do a \"tea\" rather than go to the doctors.\" \"They don't take the time to explain in detail what's happening. They just give you the tests and say it's fine.\" \"Many of the government insurances their kids have doesn't include or doesn't pay the co -pay. The Co -pays are high, so they limit themselves to taking kids to the doctors. So, families opt for 56 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex other resources. People use other options like the church has a social worker who they can talk to; they go to health fairs....\" \"Postpartum depression is something we see a lot...and no one is paying attention, and nobody is giving it importance. So, as community health promoters they...invite them (women with postpartum depression) to church groups or to see the social worker because they know there are very limited resources.\" \"The cost of medications is one the biggest issues. So, they don't use the appropriate amounts so that it will last longer, they skip days, or they take half the pill, they reuse syringes because they don't have resources for the medication.\" \"So many t imes they go to the ER for something that could be taken care of in a clinic, but the clinic takes too long to get an appointment - 15 days; a whole month to get an appointment; and if they're sick and they end up in the ER and then get a $800 bill just for a prescription for vertigo.\" \"They now have this new rule that you can be seen the same day, but you have to be there by 8:00AM, so people start lining up at 6:00AM.\" MENTAL AND BEHOVORAL HEALTH ISSUES Participants discussed behavioral issues they face raising their children, the lack of services to deal with mental health and substance abuse issues, the reliance on medication and the need to educate and train patients to help them raise healthy children. Respondents also talked of the fear and anxiety that plagues most families due to the t hreat faced by parents or older siblings who could be deported at any time. \"We have a lot of issues with raising young people. She knows a lot of friends that are struggling to raise their kids here. Behavioral issues...they don't want to follow the rules at home, we need more activities for youth so they can learn to deal with and communicate with parents...\" \"There are a lot of issues with anger. She used to see it in older youth but now she sees it a lot also in younger people.\" \"...Parents should feel comfortable telling the pediatrician they have behavioral issues with their children and they (pediatricians) should offer some kind of program or resources.\" \"...And then sometimes they will give you a referral and it's in another town, we don't even know how to get there.\" \"With EMRs they don't even give you a written referral anymore , they say no just go there, and they will have it there. They get there and there is no referral.\" \"Many times, no one is detecting the kids; the kids are walking around with a mental health issue or anxiety and it's gets detected very late.\" \"In this cou ntry if a kid runs around too much, he's hyperactive. He already has a label. And th en they give you medication to give to your kid. And, if he gets older and he has anxiety , there's another pill.\" \"There has been a big difference before and after this new pollical environment started. The children woke up to this new reality that they couldn't control. And it causes tension in the whole family. If somebody comes home late , then everybody is worried. Everybody is at the door waiting. It has created instabi lity in the house. My daughter has fears.\" \"I had to prepare my daughter that if something happens to me...I have to sit and prepare documents (guardianship).\" \"The day that...they changed administration, the kids were so upset in school the teacher had to take time with them to calm them down, to tell them it would be okay .\" 57 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex SERVICES THAT ARE MOST DIFFICULT TO ACCESS Mental health/substance abuse, dental services, primary care, referrals for screening and prevention and education services were services that were either lacking or services most often mentioned as needed by the community. Participant also felt that while most people were aware of where to get services (the clinic) it's a place where things break down. People feel mistreated or information is not given or explained in a way they understand making it difficult for patients to follow through. The lack of sufficient bilingual employees or translation services only adds to these difficulties especially with regard to mental health services. \"The services at the clinic for dental care are very limited; if you need more than taking care of your cavities and prevention work, you need to find someone else.\" \"So, if you don't have a primary care doctor; it's going to be very hard for you to get a refer ral for your mammogram, to get your pap smear.\" \"If things are not explained in a way you understand - that is what your need to do...you are not going to follow through - these people ( practitioners ) are in a rush, they don't have the time...\" \"We have a lot of services but the bridge to connect to those - to know the importance of reaching out to them is not there.\" \"Stress and anxiety are not addressed when they go to the doctor.\" \"I think that bilingual services are very limited.\" \"The language issue, when it comes to mental health, is so important - to be able to express your opinions to someone who understands your culture and the dynamics in the home...and it's impossible sometimes to have that relationship with the mental health provider, if there is a language barrier.\" CHALLENGES TO MAINTAINING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE The largest barriers to healthy lifestyles were money, access to healthy food, and safe places for physical activity. Other barriers include d the fear of deportation. Which often times keeps residents from seeking services or going to venues where they think they might be targeted. \"Healthy food sometimes is not affordable and then your option is less healthy foods.\" \"The big supermarkets are not close ; they are not here and they all expensiv e.\" \"We want to be healthy, but we don't have the elements we need to do that.\" \"One thing I like in this city is that we do have a lot of vegetable gardens; and we need to work on promoting them.\" \"People know the current political environment and they ar e afraid to go and access services.\" \"If you are undocumented the only thing you can get is charity care and you get the run around, or you are told no that's not going to be covered by charity care.\" \"We've seen a decline in people participating in programs...there was a rumor that ICE was patrolling the farmer's market and no one went to the farmer's market.\" \"In her neighborhood she is trying to get people to go out and exercise and do things outside with the children \u2014 we can't afford to have fear t ake over....\" 58 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex SUGGESTION S FOR MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE UNDOCUMENTED LATINO POPULATIONS A common theme throughout the focus group was the need for early intervention, education and prevention services to help empower the community to lead healthier lives. Another was the need for culturally and linguistically appropriate and compassionate care, case management /navigation services, and a need for patient advocates. \"We need to start earlier with young people; mental health, drug counseling and awareness.\" \"We need more comprehensive educational programs on many of the health issues facing the community e .g.: Across the board prevention workshops.\" \"Educational programs for parents on how you can raise a healthy child without resor ting to medications (hypera ctive).\" \"Make sure providers know resources available for generic medications and whatever resources are available for follow -up.\" \"Provide educational programs while people are waiting.\" \"Places in the community where people could go for basic screening and blood pressure, diabetes so they don't have to go to the clinic.\" \"We need people who speak Spanish, who can explain in their language in simple terms.\" \"We need to be educated as a community - that is going to empower us; so, the information will be o ur security, and that information will also help us empower others who need it.\" \"There is a need for health education and awareness and prevention for children and adults.\" \"Offer services when people are available - evenings.\" 59 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex 5. MIDDLESEX COUNTY /SERVICE AREA HEALTH PROFILE The Middlesex County Health Profile provides a discussion of health outcomes and factors , including social determinants of health, that are used in determining health status. Middlesex County data are compared to local, State and national measures. A. MIDDLESEX COUNTY OVERVIEW Middlesex County is located in north central New Jersey.

Middlesex County's municipalities are diverse and include large urban communities, such as New Brunswick and Newark, and Perth Amboy , as well as the suburban communities of Plainsboro, Cranbury, Monroe Township and Jamesburg . In 2018, the Census reported the count y's population at nearly 830,000 residents, making it the second most populous counties in the State. Middlesex County hosts an extensive park system totaling 6,300 acres and 22 parks. The county is also home to six major colleges and universities includ ing Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. There are five medical centers located on six campuses in Middlesex County which serve as major employers for the county.

SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH Social determinants of health include socioeconomic and environmental factors which influence health outcomes, disparities in health, equity in health care, and are important tools to assess health at the local level. Healthy People 2020 provides a framew ork for assessing social determinants of health across five topic areas: economic stability; education; social and community context; health and health care; and, neighborhood and built environment. While a relatively affluent county, there are residents of Middlesex County that face many socioeconomic challenges that may have consequences for health and health care in the region.11 1. Socioeconomic Status Socioeconomic status is the aggregate of several social, economic, and demographic measures. In this analysis, these measures include: household Income and poverty, unemployment, education, ethnic and racial makeup, age, and Divinity Health's Health Need Index by service area. According to Healthy People 2020 , socioeconomic factors contribute to disparities in disease incidence and mortality among racial, ethnic and underserved groups. Studies indicate that income and socio economic status (SES) is a better predictor of the likelihood of an individual's or group's access to education, health insurance, and safe and healthy living and working conditions than race or ethnicity. SES also impacts the prevalence of behavioral risk factors (tobacco smoking, physica l inactivity, obesity, excessive alcohol use) and rates of preventive screenings (lower SES, fewer screenings). Income, Poverty, and Unemployment Income influences the way people invest in their health and provides options for healthy lifestyle choices . In low income circumstances, preventive care expenses are more often neglected in favor of immediate living expenses. The longer people live in poverty, the more abject their income disadvantage and the more likely they are to suffer from a range of health problems. Circumstances that lead to poverty also may lead to social exclusion, discrimination, racism, stigmatization, and unemployment. Thus, the following measures of income and poverty may be evidence of these problems. Unemployment puts health at risk, starting when people first feel their jobs are threatened, before they become unemployed. Job insecurity increases mental health issues, p articularly anxiety and depression. Populations with higher unemployment rates have collective increased risk of premature death. Those who are unemployed face greater challenges to health and well -being, including lost income and health insurance. Unemployed individuals are 54% more likely to be in poor or fair health as compared to employed individuals. Accord ing to CHR, racial and ethnic minorities and those with less education, often already at -risk for poor health outcomes, are most likely to be unemployed. Labor statistics indicate unemployment rates peaked at the height of the recession in 2010 and began t o show some improvement beginning in 2014. Most areas of the State have shown continued improvement. 11 https://ww w.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics -objectives/topic/social -determinants -of-health 62 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex Middlesex County Although Middlesex County has affluent areas, pockets of poverty in New Brunswick, Highland Park and Monroe Township exist.

To ascertain the number of households that may be struggling due to the high cost of living in New Jersey we turned to the United Way's ALICE (Asset Limited Income Constrained Employed project)18 to get a better idea of the number of households that earn more than the Federal Poverty Level but less than the basic cost of living in Middlesex County.

Education People with higher levels of educational attainment tend to have lower morbidity rates from acute and chronic diseases, independent of demographic and labor market factors. Life expectancy is increasing in the United States, yet differences have become more pronounced between those with and without a college education. The mechanisms by which education influences health are complex and likely include interrelationships between demographic and family background indicators, effects of poor health in childhood, greater resources associated with higher levels of education, a learned appreciation for the importance of good health behaviors, and one's social networks.22 The ability to communicate in English is also a key part of education al competence. The lack of English proficiency can negatively impact one's ability to understand and follow medical directions.

Health and Health Care Access to affordable quality health care is important to physical, social, and mental health. Health insurance helps individuals and families access needed primary care, specialists, and emergency care, but does not ensure access. It is also necessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients and be near patients.27 27 http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/our 2014 2015New Jersey Middlesex County Union County Somerset County Monmouth County National Benchmark: 22.1 Middlesex County 2015: 6.7 Indicator Healthy People 2020 Target County Health Rankings Benchmark New Jersey Membership Organizations N.A. 79 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex Health Insurance The expansion of Medicaid coverage and the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) coverage provisions , which began taking effect in 2010, helped decrease the nation's uninsured rate by 7.2 percentage points, from 16 percent in 2016 . That translates into 20.4 million fewer people who lacked health insurance in 2016 compared to 2010. The uninsured rate is estimated to have increased to 15.5% in the first quarter of 2018, meaning another 4 million lost coverage since 2016 due to changes in health policy and insurance offerings. The uninsured are less likely to have primary care providers than the insured; they also receive less preventive care , dental care, chronic disease management, and behavioral health counseling. Those without insurance are often diagnosed at later, less treatable disease stages than those with insurance and, overall, have worse health outcomes, lower quality of life, and higher mortality rates. Neighborhoods with low health insurance rates often have fewer providers, hospital beds and emergency resources than areas with higher rates. Even the insured have more difficulty getting care in these areas. Cost can be a barrier to care even for those who have insurance. Lack of insurance creates barriers to timely access to care for patients and financial burdens to the providers who care for them. Since 2013, the non -elderly population without health insurance in Middl esex County has trended downward, decreasing from 14.4 % in 2013 to 9.7% in 2015. From 2013 through 2015, Middlesex County had consistently lower rates of non -elderly population without health insurance than statewide . In 201 5, Middlesex County 's uninsured rate (9.7%) was higher than the ambitious Healthy People 2020 target of no person without health coverage .

Health insurance assists individuals and families to obtain primary care, specialists, and emergency care, but does not ensure access. Access to care goes beyond just insurance, it is also necessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients and be near patients.28 Primary Care Physicians Nationally, many areas lack sufficient providers to meet patient needs; as of June 2014, there are about 7,200 primary care, 5,000 mental health and 5,900 dental federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas in the US. Having a usual primary care provider is associated with a higher likelihood of appropriate care and better outcomes. In 2017, 88% of Americans had a usual source of care, but those with low incomes are less likely to than those with higher incomes, and the uninsured are twice as likely as the insured to lack a usual care source.29,30 Between 2013 and 2015, the ratio of population to physicians in Middlesex County increased from 1,052:1 to 1,064:1 . In 201 5, the Middlesex County rat io for primary care providers wa s worse than the CHR national benchmark (1,030:1).

Based on a wide array of demogra phic and economic statistics, the CNI provides a score for every populated ZIP Code in the United States. A score of 1.0 indicates a ZIP Code with the least need and a score of 5.0 represents a ZIP Code with the most need. The CNI is useful as part of a la rger community health needs assessment to pinpoint specific areas with greater need than others. The CNI score is an average of five barrier scores that measure socio -economic indicators of each community using 2017 source data. The five barriers are: 1. Income Barrier Percentage of households below poverty line, with head of household age 65 or older Percentage of families with children under 18 below poverty line Percentage of single female -headed families with children under 18 below poverty line 2. Cultural Barrier Percentage of population that is minority (including Hispanic ethnicity) Percentage of population over age 5 that speaks English poorly or not at all 31 Truven Health Analytics, 2017; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2017; Claritas, IndicatorHealthy People 2020 Primary Care Physicians Rate/ 100000 PopulationN.A Health Care Access/ Coverage Do You Have Any Kind of Coverage % No RED: Poorest Performing Quartile Yellow: Middle Quartiles Green: Best Performing Quartile 82 Community Health Needs Assessment Healthier Middlesex 3.

Housing Barrier Percentage of households renting their home A comparison of CNI scores and hospital utilization reveals a strong correlation between need and use. Communities with low CNI scores can be expected to have high hospital utilization. There is a causal relationship between CNI scores and preventable hospitalizations and ED visits for manageable conditions. Comm unities with high CNI scores may have more hospitalization and ED visits that could have been avoided with improved healthy community structures and appropriate outpatient and primary care.

Conversely, Helmetta (1.6) and Milltown (1.8) represent ed the lowest CNI score s in the Service Area.

Young children can be exposed by swallowing lead dust or soil that gets on their hands or objects they put into their mouths such as toys; swallowing leaded paint chips; breathing leaded dust or lead contaminated air and eating food or drinking water that is contaminated with lead. Very high levels of lead can cause seizures, brain damage, developmental or intellectual disabilities, coma and even death. Exposure to lead, even at low level s, has been associated with decrease hearing, lower intelligence, hyperactivity, attention deficit, and developmental problems.35 County level analysis cannot reveal individual town disparities in blood lead levels particularly in towns with housing stock built before 1950.

Health Behaviors Maternal / Fetal Health Prenatal Care The medical care a woman receives during pregnancy monitors her health and the developing fetus. Low - risk pregnancies should visit a prenatal provider every four or six weeks through 28 weeks, then every two or thre e weeks from weeks 28 -36, and finally every week in the ninth month until delivery. A high -risk pregnancy requires additional visits.40 Pregnant women who do not receive adequate prenatal care risk undetected complications and an increased possibility of adverse outcomes. Early and regular prenatal care is a strategy to improve health outcomes for mothers and infants. Two significant benefits are improved birth weight and decreased preterm delivery. Infants born to mothers who receive no prenatal care hav e an infant mortality rate five times higher than mothers who receive appropriate prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy. Enrollment in care during the first trimester of pregnancy reflects timely initiation of prenatal care.41 In 2016, 74.6 % of Middlesex County women entered prenatal care in the first trimester compared to 72.1% in New Jersey. As compared to other New Jersey counties, Middlesex County ranks in the middle performing quartile.

People who engage in all of these behaviors are 66 percent less likely to die early from cancer , 65 percent less likely to die early from cardiovascular disease and 57 percent less likely to die early from other causes compared to those who d o not engage in any of the se behaviors.45 Tobacco Use Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking leads to disease and disability, and harms nearly every organ in the body, and causes cancer , heart disease, stroke, diabetes , and lung diseases such as emphysema, bronchitis, and chronic airway obstruction . Exposure to secondhand smoke can lead to lung cancer and heart disease. Each year, smoking kills approximately 480,000 Americans, including 4 1,000 from secondhand smoke. On average, smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers. About 1 5% of U.S. adults smoke. Each day, nearly 3,200 youth smoke thei r first cigarette, and 2,100 people transition from occasional to daily smokers. Smokeless tobacco also lead s to various cancer s, gum and teeth problems, and nicotine addiction. Almost 6% of young adults use smokeless tobacco and half of new users are yo unger than 18.46, 47 NJBRFS did not separate out use of nicotine vaping devices in the question regarding smoking. We are aware through information obtained from primary research conducted for this CHNA, that a majority of adolescents and young adults are choosing vaping products over the use of cigarettes and that some adolescents may not even be aware of the fact that vaping devices are just another form of nicotine delivery. Vaping among adolescents has been a major concern of community stakeholders and current news articles and reports of deaths and lung disease associated with vaping has become a major issue of concern. Between 2012 and 2016, smoking rates have fluctuated in Middlesex County with an overall decrease of 1.7 percentage points. In 2016, there were 10.7 % less smokers in Middlesex County ( 12.5%) than New Jersey (14. 0%). Middlesex County had more adult smokers than neighboring Somerset County ( 8.50%) .

Over time, excessive alcohol consumption is a risk factor for hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, fetal alcohol syndrome, liver disease and certain cancer s.48 Binge drinkers, those men t hat consume more than 5 drinks and women that consume more than 4 drinks in one occasion, increased from 16.1 % in 2014 , to 17.6 % in 2016.

As of 201 6, 41 million Americans struggled with hunger in the U.S. A household that is food insecure has limited or uncertain access to enough food to support a healthy life. Obesity among food insecure people, as well as low income ind ividuals, occurs in part because they are often subject to the same challenges as other Americans (more sedentary lifestyles, increased portion size) and because they face unique challenges in adopting and maintaining healthy behaviors, including limited r esources and lack of access to affordable healthy food, cycles of food deprivation and overeating, high levels of stress and anxiety, fewer opportunities for physical activity, greater exposure to marketing of obesity promoting products, and limited access to health care.49 The percent of Middlesex County residents with a Body Mass Index (BMI) >=30 trended upward from 21.3 % in 2011, to 27.6 % in 2016.

Cancer Screening Breast Cancer (mammography) According to the American Cancer Association, women ages 40 to 44 should have the choice to start annual breast cancer screening with mammograms (x -rays of the breast) if they wish to do so. Women age 45 to 54 should get mammograms every year. Women 55 and older should switch to mammograms every 2 years or can continue yearly screening. Screening should continue as long as a woman is in good health and is expected to live 10 more years or longer. Women should also know how their breasts normally look and fe el and report any breast changes to a health care provider right away. Some women - because of their family history, a genetic tendency, or certain other factors - should be screened with MRIs along with mammograms. The number of women who fall into this c ategory is very small. In 2016, 75.1 % of Middlesex County women over age 40 had a mammography within the past two years, up 20.5 percentage points since 2012.

Premature Deaths An alternate method to reviewing crude or age -adjusted death rates as a measure of premature mortality is assessing Y ears of Potential Life Lost (YPLL). YPLL calculate the number of years of potential life lost for each death occurring before a predetermined end point, in this case, age 75 per 100,000 population. Premature deaths are reviewed to highlight potentially preventable adverse outcomes.

Low and Very Low Birth Weight Infants Birth weight is the most important factor affecting neonatal mortality and a significant determinant of post neonatal mortality . Low birth weight infants (less than 2,500 grams) are at an increased risk for health problems ranging from neurodevelopmental disabilities to respiratory disorders.60 Racial disparities in low birth weight babies persist; nationally, non -Hispanic Black infants continue to die at nearly twice the rate of non -Hispanic Whites. Low Birth Weight In 2016, Middlesex County had a higher percentage of low birth weight babies ( 8.0%) than its comparison counties. The 201 6 percent of Middlesex County low birth weight babies was more than the Healthy People 2020 target of 7.8% .

Very low birth weight babies (less than 1,500 grams ) are at greater risk of adverse outcomes than low birth weight babies. Very Low Birth Weight In 2016, 1.3% of Middlesex County babies are very low birth weight as compared to 1.4% statewide . The 201 6 percent of very low birth weight babies in Middlesex County was higher than the rates in Somerset (1.20%) and Monmouth (1.00%) Counties .

Health Status and Behavioral Health Status Health status and behavioral health status are broad multidimensional concepts including self -report measures of physical and mental health. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the nation's premier system of he alth-related telephone surveys, collects data about U.S. residents regarding health -related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions and use of preventive services. In 1984 , the survey began collecting data in 15 states and is currently conducted in all state s includ ing Washington D.C. and three United States territories. The most recent data available are for the year 201 6. General Health Status Between 2012 and 201 6, BRFSS data report ed an increase in the percent of Middlesex County residents who indi cate their health as \" fair or poor ,\" from 13.3% to 17. 8%. In 2016, 17.5% of New Jersey respondents report that their health is \"fair or poor,\" lower than the rate among Middlesex County and Union County residents. As compared to all New Jersey counties, Middlesex County residents with \" fair or poor \" health rank in the middle performing quartile.

The three most common t ypes of diabetes are Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational. Individuals with diabetes may develop serious health complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, amputation and premature death. Type 1 develops when insulin producing cells located in the pancreas are destroyed. There is no known way to prevent Type 1 diabetes. In order t o survive, Type 1 diabet ics must have insulin delivered by injection or pump. Type 2 primarily onsets with insulin resistance disorder in which cells within the muscles, liver, and fat tissue are unable to properly use insulin. Higher risk for developing Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age, obesity, family history of diabetes , history of gestational diabetes , impaired glucose metabolism, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity. African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians, some Asians, and Native Hawaiians or other Pacif ic Islanders are at particularly high risk for Type 2. Gestational diabetes is a form of glucose intolerance diagnosed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The risk factors for gestational diabetes are similar to those for t ype 2 diabetes.63 Diabetes is decreasing among Middlesex County residents. Between 2014 ( 11.8 %) and 2016 (10.1%), the rate decreased by 1.7 percentage points.
