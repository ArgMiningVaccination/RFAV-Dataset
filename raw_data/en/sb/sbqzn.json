Filippone, Chief Practitioner Licensing and Investigations Section Department of Public Health From: Abby Beale, Homeopathy for Connecticut Date: August 3, 2012 Subject: Scope of Practice Request ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Homeopathy for Connecticut is propos ing to expand the practice of homeopathy in Connecticut to nationally certified homeopaths . Accordingly, we are submittingthe attached scope of practice request, as described in Public Act 11-209. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact me. Thank you in advance for your consideration. Contact information: Abby Beale 5 Dogwood Lane Wallingford, CT 06492 Phone: 203-530-3367 Email: abbylearn@gmail.com 1 HOMEOPATHY for CONNECTICUT Scope of Practice Request Submitted to the Connecticut Department of Public Health August 3, 2012 1. A plain language descri ption of the request. Expand the practice of homeopathy in C onnecticut to include board certified homeopaths - individuals who have successfully completed the educational requirements, passed the national certi fication exam and earned the designation of Certified Classical Homeopath (CCH). This proposal wi ll increase consumer access to qualified homeopaths and allow we ll-trained professional homeopaths to provide homeopathic care in t he state. Applicant s will be required to have passed the certification exam offered by the national Council for Homeopathic Certification, a national organization that sets standards for the profession, examines and certifies professional homeopaths, and monitors compliance for continuing education. The current scope of practice law in Conn ecticut regarding homeopat hy, which limits the practice of homeopathy to physicians, is unnecessarily restrictive. The law was established in 1893 - over 100 years ago - and does not serve the public well. Nationally certified homeopaths should be a llow to practice in CT as they meet the highest standards of the profession. Certified homeopaths do not practice medi cine, do not diagnose or treat illness or disease, do not perform invasive proc edures and do not represent themselves as medical professionals. Homeopathy considers the entire individual and works to improve vitality and decrease susceptibility to illness. Homeopathic re medies are highly dilute and work on an energetic level, not a chemical level. As such, remedies do not interfere with the action of pharmaceuticals or other medicines. This proposal can be implemented at little or no cost to the State. A medical examining board is not needed since certified homeopath s are non-medical practitioners. The Council for Homeopathic Certification has agr eed to work with Connecticut to verify certification of practitioners as well as monitor compliance with continuing education requirements. In addition, revenue for t he State of Connecticut could be generated through annual registration fees. 2 2. Public health and safety benefits th at the requestor believes will be achieved should the request be implemented and, if applicable, a description of any harm to public health and safety shoul d the request not be implemented. Expanding the practice of hom eopathy in Connecticut to nat ionally certified homeopaths provides the following benefits: Assures the availability of highly competent homeopaths. Allows greater freedom of choice. Provides greater access to homeopathy , a holistic form of health care that addresses the whole person as an indi vidual in order to strengthen the constitution and thereby rais e the general level of health. Provides greater access to well-chosen homeopathic remedies t hat stimulate the body's immune system to heal itself in a wa y that is safe, natural and non-toxic. The national Council for Homeopathic Certificat ion (CHC) sets the proficiency standards in the U.S. for professional homeopaths. The requirement s for CHC certification are rigorous, requiring significantly more hours of homeopathic study and practice than is required for either licensed medical doctor homeopaths or naturopaths in Connecticut (see attached CHC certificat ion requirements). Professional competence is fostered by t he continuing education requirements set by the CHC. The CHC monitors compliance with the continuing education requirements among Certified Classical Homeopaths and is willing to provide notification of compliance to the State of C onnecticut (see attached letter). The risk of harm to the public is negligible. Homeopathy is not a medical practice, homeopaths do not diagnose or treat diseas e nor perform invasive procedures, and homeopathic remedies are available to t he public over the counter. A homeopathic remedy works on an energetic level by stimul ating the body to heal itself. There are rarely consumer complaints, malpractice clai ms or investigations regarding any type of homeopathic provider. In Connecticut, there have been no malpractice decisions made against homeopaths. 3. The impact that the request wi ll have on public access to health care. This scope of practice change w ill expand the current limited av ailability of homeopathy throughout the state while assuring the highe st level of profe ssional competence. Homeopathy offers a holistic approach to su pport wellness and well being that is safe, cost effective and environmentally responsible. 3 Currently, access to homeopathic care is very restricted in Connecticut - more than any other state. There are only 10 licensed medi cal doctor homeopaths in the state (few of which practice homeopathy), and a limited number of naturopaths offer homeopathy. This has severely limited the availability of homeopaths in the st ate and the guidance they offer to the public. According to the 2007 National Health Interview Survey, which included a comprehensive survey of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use by Americans, an estimated 3.9 million U.S. adults and approximately 900,000 children used homeopathy in the previous year. 4. A brief summary of state or federal laws that govern the health care profession making the request. The Connecticut General Statute establis hing the Homeopathic Medical Examining Board (CGA 20-8) was codified in 1893 - we ll over a century ago. CGA 20-12n defines homeopathic physicians and sets out requirem ents for licensure and oversight by the Connecticut Homeopathic Medical Examining Board. This law restricts the practice of homeopathy to medical doctors, which is undul y restrictive since homeopathy does not involve the practice of medicine. Homeopathy is a distinct discipline and does not require training in other professions. Although some medical doctors do practi ce homeopathy, they represent a small minority of homeopathic prac titioners in the U.S. It's important to note that hom eopathic remedies are sold over the counter and anyone is free to purchase and use them for self -care at home. Homeopathic remedies are regulated by the Federal Food and Drug Ad ministration (FDA) and listed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States. There are no federal laws governi ng the practice of homeopathy. 5. The state's current re gulatory oversight of the health care profession making the request. The Connecticut Homeopathic Medical Examin ing Board oversees the practice of homeopathic physicians. 6. All current education, training and examination requirements and any relevant certification requirements applicable to the health care profession making the request. 4 The national Council on Homeo pathic Certification provides rigorous standards and a national exam that assesses competency in t he skills required for professional practice of homeopathy. To qualify as a nationa lly certified homeopath the Council for Homeopathic Certification requi res that a person have: (1) 500 hours of homeopathic theoretical training, (2) College level courses in anat omy, physiology and pathology, (3) 390 hours of clinical experienc e including 10 supervised cases, (4) Passed the 6 hour nati onal certification exam, (5) Presented five written cases taken without supervision, and (6) Passed the personal interview process. To maintain this certification, practitioner s must complete a minimum of 20 hours of continuing education eac h calendar year. Homeopathy is a discipline unto itself, alt hough some homeopaths also have training in other health professions such as acupunc ture, chiropractic, massage therapy, naturopathy, nursing and medicine. Each ce rtified homeopath is required to follow a clearly stated professional code of ethics and to meet annual requirements for continuing education. There are a number of trai ning programs for homeopaths throughout the U.S. that prepare individuals for certification as a classical homeopath. No such program currently exists in Connecticut. The standards for homeopathic education a dopted by the Accreditation Commission for Homeopathic Education in North America, are described in \" Standards and Competencies for the Profe ssional Practice of Hom eopathy in North America \" (www.achena.org/Docs/2001_CHE _Standards_revised_1106.pdf 7. A summary of known scope of practi ce changes either requested or enacted concerning the health care profession in the five-year period preceding the date. There has been no scope of practice changes regarding homeopaths in the last five years (2007 - 2012). This current proposal to expand the practice of homeopathy in Connecticut to nationally certified hom eopaths was pursued in the 2011 and 2012 legislative sessions. 5 8. The extent to which the request direct ly impacts existing relationships within the health care delivery system. This proposal does not infringe on the scope of pr actice of any other profession. It also does not impact existing relationships within the health care delivery system. Certified homeopaths are a part of a la rger community of alte rnative and complementary practitioners serving the public. They do not conflict with medical practice but provide complementary support. 9. The anticipated economic impact of the request on the health care delivery system. Since there are very few homeopaths practicing in Connecticut due to the restrictiveness of current law, many individu als go out of state to find a well-qualified homeopath. Also, well trained and board cert ified homeopaths leave the state to practice their profession. By allowing nationally certified homeopaths to practice in Connecticut, the general public is provided increased access to a low cost and alternative approach to health and wellness. Homeopathic practitioners will benef it by the increased access to, knowledge of and visibility of homeopathy in the state. Ultimately, well-tra ined board certified homeopaths will come to this state to practi ce. They will benefit from a community of well-qualified peers. This in turn will provide greater choice for consumers and create more visibility and demand for qualifi ed practitioners of these services. 10. Regional and national trends concerning licensure of the health care profession making the request and a summa ry of relevant scope of practice provisions enacted in other states. Throughout the U.S. homeopathy is a largely an unregulated profession. This is due to the fact that homeopaths do not practi ce medicine and that homeopathy has been shown to be very safe, working on an ener getic rather than a chemical level. Only three (3) states license medical doc tors to practice homeopathy (CT, AZ, and NV) - Connecticut's law is from 1893. Of these, only Connec ticut restricts the practice of homeopathy to medical doctors. Eight (8) states have Health Freedom laws allowing non-licensed, non-medical alternative and complementary care provid ers, including homeopaths, to provide their services: AZ, CA, R I, Idaho, MN, NM, and OK. (http://www.nationalhealthfreedom. org/InfoCenter/laws_passed.html ) 6 Homeopathic remedies are sold over the c ounter without a prescription in all states and are regulated by the FDA (U.S. Homeopathic Pharmacopeia) 11. Identification of any health car e professions that can reasonably be anticipated to be directly impacted by the request, the natu re of the impact and efforts made by the requestor to discuss the request with such health care professions. No health care professions are directly impacted by this request, including licensed homeopathic medical doctors and naturopaths. 12. A description of how the request relat es to the health care profession's ability to practice to the full extent of th e profession's educat ion and training. The current licensing law in Connecticut unduly restricts the practice of homeopathy. Only medical doctors are currently eligible for licensure as homeop aths and naturopaths may practice homeopathy but may not call themselves homeopaths. As a result, well- trained and qualified certified homeopaths are not allowed to provide homeopathy in Connecticut. This does not reflect the situat ion in much of the rest of the U.S. Much has changed in homeopathy (as well as medicine) since 1893 when the current licensing law for homeopathic physicians was enacted in Connecticut. At that time, Homeopathic Medical Colleges were popular ( 20 on the East coast alone) and therefore well-trained homeopaths were medical docto rs. This is no longer the case, as homeopathic training no longer exists in medical schools in this country. Extending the practice of homeopathy to certified home opaths would bring Connecticut into the 21 st century as well as bring it the distin ction of having the most progressive and high standards in the country . It is important to note that homeopaths and doctors are two distinct professions with very different educations and training requi rements. Homeopathy is a discipline unto itself. Regardless of whether a homeopath al so has a degree in medicine, nursing, chiropractic, acupuncture or other profe ssion, a homeopath recommends homeopathic remedies and monitors the care and progress of i ndividuals through follow-up visits. This valuable guidance is all a homeopath does. Unlike a medical doctor, a homeopath does not diagnose diseases, administer or dispense legend drugs or controlled substances, engage in surgery or in any pr actices that invade the human body by puncture of the skin, or set fractures. Recognition of certified hom eopaths assures the public of a high level of competence among practitioners. Allowi ng more homeopaths to practice in Connecticut allows growth of a system of natural health care that is safe, effective and environmentally sustainable and is recognize d throughout the world. 7 Attachments: Letter of Support, Council for Homeopathic Certification Council for Homeopathic Certification - Requirements for Certification Submitted by Homeopathy for Connecticut August 2012 Comparison of Homeopathic Educational Requirements Nationally Certified Homeopaths (CCH) CT Homeopathic Medical Doctors (MD) Naturopathic Physicians (ND)* Number of Required Classroom Hours 500 30 144 Number of Required Clinical Hours 390 90 72 if in homeopathic specialty clinic; plus other exposure in naturopathic clinic ad hoc Number of Required Supervised Cases 10 none none Number of Independent Cases 5 none none Required Medical Education Medical Terminology, Anatomy and Physiology, Pathology Medical Doctor; Requirements of Section 2010 of the General Statutes Doctor of Naturopathy; Requirements of Section 2034 to 42 of the General Statutes Exam contents Section I: Philosophy Section II: Human Health Sciences Section III: Materia Medica Section IV: Repertory Section V: Case Taking Section I: Foundations of Homeopathy Section II: Practice of Homeopathy Comprehensive Board Exam that incorporates Health Sciences and Homeopathy: ~Philosophy ~Materia Medica ~Repertory ~Cases Oral Interview YES NO NO Continuing Education Requirements 20 hours per year in homeopathy (CHC requirement) 50 hours every two years in their area(s) of practice (though not specific to homeopathy) (State of CT Requirement) 15 every year (though not specific to homeopathy) (State of CT requirement) *per University of Bridgeport Naturopathic School requirements HOMEOPATHY for CONNECTICUT National Certification Requirements To become certified as a Certif ied Classical Homeopath (CCH), the Council for Homeopathic Certificatio n (CHC) following: 1.

PMB 187 Toll free Fax 18153667622 Covington, WA 98042 www.homeopathicdirectory.com March 2, 2010 Dear Ms. Wolf and Ms. Beale: The CHC understands that a group of homeopat hs and consumers are working together in Connecticut to change the laws to a llow the practice of homeopathy by highly qualified homeopaths, specifically those with the CCH designation. We understand that this model of certification relies on the Council for Homeopathic Certification to set the prer equisite requirements for certif ication, administer the exam, and communicate with the Connecticut Depar tment of Public Health when needed to verify certification in place of the St ate of Connecticut setting the standard for professional homeopaths (which costs money and resources they don't have). The CHC supports Ms. Beale's and Wolf's statement that th e standards for the profession of homeopathy \"are best set and ma intained by the profession itself rather than by state government.\" As Ms. Beale and Ms. Wolf have noted \"this approach has two strong advantages. It allows the standards of practice to evolve with the profession and remain relevant. It also offers a model of regulation for the state that does not require establishing a mechanism for se tting standards and administering an exam. Succeeding in this effort would be breaking new ground in the practice of homeopathy in the United States.\" While the CHC is solely a certifying body, and does not engage in either PAC or legislative issues, the CHC supports Ms. Be ale and Wolf's efforts and proposal to change the Connecticut state law to allow homeopaths who have achieved the distinction of Certified Class ical Homeopath (CCH) to fully practice homeopathy and call themselves Homeopaths. Sincerely, Jacki Fox Executive Director "}
