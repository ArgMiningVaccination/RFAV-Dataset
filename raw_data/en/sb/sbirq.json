Many women require support for PMS, perimenopause, and post-menopause. You aren't alone. If you feel like you are losing your mind and your quality of life isn't what you want it to be, hormone imbalance may be the culprit. The Healing Collective offers hormone balancing and bioidentical hormone replacement therapies customized to address your hormone-related issues. With holistic medicine treatments designed to optimize your hormone levels safely, we alleviate symptoms so you can live a healthier life. Turn to The Healing Collective to regain control of your hormone health. As women age, hormone levels tend to drop or become unbalanced, leading to myriad unpleasant symptoms. While some women produce enough of their own natural hormones, about half of women struggle with hormone imbalance and require menopause treatment. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a natural alternative medicine approach, using plant-derived compounds with the same molecular and chemical structure as the hormones the body produces. HRT comes in different forms, including creams, pills, and patches, and is tailored to meet your unique hormone needs. At The Healing Collective, we understand that some clients are concerned about the risk of breast cancer with HRT. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation about the treatment and how it relates to cancer risk. We ensure you have all the information to make an informed choice about your treatment options. When HRT is handled correctly, monitoring levels every three to six months, and using bioidentical hormone replacement like we do at our clinic, you can experience safe, life-changing results. We've never had a single HRT client develop breast cancer. You may have a hunch that your hormones are unbalanced. A general feeling of unwellness, along with several other symptoms, are indicators of over or under-production of hormones. However, proper testing from a reputable hormone specialist can help you identify your specific imbalance so you can get customized HRT. Here are some of the most common symptoms of hormone imbalance: Because hormones inhibit or stimulate your body's biochemical pathways, they help your body regulate functions and ensure all components work together harmoniously. When they are unbalanced, you may experience minor or major symptoms. It's important to keep in mind that hormone replacement therapy is not a one-size-fits-all solution, which is why proper testing is crucial to your optimal outcome. Tailored HRT is a powerful treatment to slow down the effects of aging, rejuvenate your body, and achieve a greater overall sense of well-being. Working with an experienced functional medicine practitioner at The Healing Collective will give you the information and support you need to confidently move forward in your hormone treatment. Natural bioidentical hormone replacement therapy combined with a functional medicine approach has proven to be a winning combination for women in all stages of life-from perimenopause to post-menopause. Our goal is to use HRT to relieve your symptoms and enhance your quality of life while decreasing your risk for diseases like cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. We've found the accessibility and customization we can achieve with bioidentical hormones make them an incredibly effective tool in our functional medicine tool kit. Choosing a hormone specialist who is also a functional medicine practitioner gives you the best of both worlds\u2014an expert in hormone balancing and a holistic medicine approach to help your whole body achieve a higher level of health than ever before. There's no need to live with minor or major symptoms of hormone imbalance. At The Healing Collective, we are dedicated to your health education and empowerment to help you heal and sustain a life of optimum wellness. "}
