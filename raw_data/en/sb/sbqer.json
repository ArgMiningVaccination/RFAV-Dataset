{"title": "Pakistan Ranks Third Globally With the Most Unvaccinated Children: Is the Impact of Parental Perception and Attitude on Immunization an Essential Contributing Factor to an Unsuccessful Vaccination Coverage?", "author": "Rabail Saeed; Irtiza Hashmi", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Introduction Having the third-highest burden of child mortality and ranking third globally for the most under-vaccinated children, Pakistan contains 15% of its population under the age of five, which accounts for 50% of the mortality rate in this country. Every year, almost three million children miss out on an entire course of the most readily available vaccines, leaving them vulnerable to life-threatening diseases. The Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) was launched in 1978 to protect children from vaccine-preventable childhood diseases. It is the main program through which routine immunization is provided to the public. However, since its inception within Pakistan, it has encountered many problems, including a lack of parental awareness and education. Low literacy rate, socio-economic disparities, cultural and religious beliefs have made parents doubtful about vaccinations. This term is known as vaccine hesitancy. Belief in conspiracy theories has also led to reduced vaccination coverage in Pakistan. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 300 parents with children under five, chosen from Karachi, Pakistan, through a convenience sampling technique. The data was collected via 300 self-administered or researcher administered questionnaires. Associations were evaluated using the chi-square test with the level of significance taken as p < 0.05 and Cramer's V to determine the strength of these associations. Data analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Results Strong associations were found between parental knowledge of immunization, vaccines, and willingness to get their children immunized. Associations were greater and significant in parents with a higher level of education compared to lower. However, lack of knowledge about certain essential vaccines like Pentavalent, Pneumococcal, and IPV was an important aspect to consider. Also, it was noted that their inability to access these free vaccines was due to their own firm beliefs. It was also about the lack of awareness and facilities for a better and beneficial program. 22.3% of parents said that administering multiple vaccines at a time would be harmful to their child, and 21.7% believed it would cause the disease it's supposed to prevent. However, the majority of the parents said they would strongly recommend others to get vaccinated. In this study, religions included and investigated mostly encouraged vaccination to their relatives (p value= 0.079). Occupation and Monthly income had little to no effect on the immunization regime of young children. Conclusion An impact of higher levels of education on the perceptions and attitudes of parents regarding the immunization of children was noted. Consequently, as religion, gender, occupation, and monthly income do not affect parents' perceptions regarding immunizations, the problem lies within their knowledge and understanding of basic medical science and easily communicable diseases. Oblivious to the consequences of contracting a lethal disease, it has developed a laid-back attitude amongst parents. Hence, awareness and education of parents regarding vaccine-preventable diseases by the healthcare system and the governing bodies can lead to a higher successful immunization rate.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2021-11-19", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
