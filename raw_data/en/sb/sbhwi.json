Veterinary: Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) We encourage you to stay motivated, persevere with hard work, and strive for alpha letter grade, especially for BCPM courses. This is an opportunity to demonstrate your adaptability and resiliency as aspiring healthcare providers, clinicians, and scientists. As of May 5, 2020, AAMC declared that alternative grades such as CR/NR are considered as supplemental hours. Supplemental hours will not be included in the AMCAS GPA calculation. Medical schools are well aware of the unique challenges that students are facing now, so courses taken in Spring 2020/Summer 2020 will be reviewed in context. That said, Bs are fine grades and you shouldn't select CR/NC just because you are worried you may get one or more Bs this semester. Also, a \"C\" by itself won't keep you out of medical or other health professions schools. Consider opting to CR/NR for non-science classes if that helps you focus on doing well on the prerequisites, and be sure to reach out to your faculty and OXY's [Academic Support](/academics/academic-support) team for personalized support. Ultimately, one course/one semester is a small part of your academic performance and it should not impact the big picture. For first-year and sophomore students, be sure to demonstrate an upward GPA trend. For juniors and seniors, focus on doing well on MCAT and securing strong letters of recommendation. For any course in which a student has received an Incomplete, and then a letter grade after completing the course, students will list the grade as I/A (or I/B, I/C, depending on the student's grade) in AMCAS. Students should click the \"Incomplete\" box for this course. During the AMCAS verification process, the alpha letter grade will be confirmed and calculated appropriately into the GPA. You may take courses over the summer, but with limitations. Students can transfer coursework from an accredited institution to Oxy for credit. However, students currently registered at Oxy must obtain prior approval to take courses at another institution. All transfer courses require prior approval by the department offering similar courses at Oxy, and by the student's adviser. Transfer courses used for Core requirements also require prior approval by the Core Director. The [\"Transfer Credit & Course Substitution Form\"](/sites/default/files/assets/Registrar/transfer_credit_course_substitution_web1_0.pdf) is available through the Office of the Registrar. Refer to the [Transfer Credit](http://oxy.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2019-2020/Catalog/Academic-Information-and-Policies/Transfer-Credit) section of the catalog for complete information. If the summer course is not needed to fulfill Occidental College graduation requirements but is a prerequisite for medical or health profession school applications, you do not need to obtain prior approval from any department or adviser, nor do you need to transfer the credits to Oxy. For online courses, refer to the Official Updates section above. Each program's COVID-19 pass/fail policies might also include information about online courses and labs. However, be sure to visit each school's admissions website for the most current policy regarding online courses. When you are ready to apply to medical or health profession schools, you must submit official transcripts from Occidental College and all other accredited institutions, regardless of the type of courses completed. With various restrictions, it may be challenging to accumulate clinical or volunteering hours. We cannot predict when opportunities will become available. Remember, such change is universal, so you are not at a disadvantage. We encourage you to stay engaged in positive activities, to get creative, and to find alternate ways to give back with limited contact. After all, it is extremely important to stay healthy and safe during this time. The AAMC article, \" [Highlighting Non-Medical Related Experiences](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/highlighting-non-medical-related-experiences/?utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=navigator&utm_content=newsletter),\" reminds applicants that experiences outside of clinical settings are valuable.

Princeton University offers some [ideas on journaling](https://hpa.princeton.edu/news/question-week-journaling-pre-health-student). Also, use the [AAMC Anatomy of an Applicant Self Assessment Guide](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/preparing-med-school/anatomy-applicant/)and [AACOM's Qualities of a Successful Medical Student](https://choosedo.org/qualities-successful-osteopathic-medical-student/)to consider your preparation for medical school and the medical profession. In applications and during interviews, be prepared to describe how COVID-19 has impacted your decision to apply. In addition, you may be asked to address any academic, personal, financial or professional barriers. - Develop a working list of schools: We provide an extensive list of [online resources](/academics/academic-support/pre-health-advising/useful-links)for pre-med and pre-health students. [Medical School Admission Requirements](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/applying-medical-school-process/medical-school-admission-requirements/)(MSAR) will allow you to see specifics required by US and Canadian medical schools. Other online directories of accredited schools are also available for other professions. Create a list of schools where you'd like to apply. A spreadsheet might help you track and consider important factors aside from pre-requisite coursework and test scores, e.g., mission statement, state residency, tuition and costs of living, and admitted student profile/demographics. As of April 6, [Pearson VUE has closed U.S.-based test centers for the safety of employees and examinees](https://home.pearsonvue.com/Standalone-pages/Coronavirus-update.aspx). Please follow the guidance provided by Pearson to reschedule your exam. If you are applying to the 2021 matriculation cycle without an MCAT score, you can submit your AMCAS with a single school selected. This will put you in the queue for application verification, and you can opt for adding more schools or withdraw from the current cycle depending on your test result. We strongly encourage submitting your AMCAS by mid-June for fast processing, which allows for earlier access to secondary applications and earlier file completion at schools, and your application verification is not dependent on MCAT results. When rescheduling your MCAT, ideal dates will be before August, so that your test score will arrive in time to complete your application file. Medical school admissions is rolling-based, be sure to be proactive about the timeline. Emotional distress is common and normal in the context of uncertainty. Stress can present itself in different ways, including physical, emotional, or cognitive ways. Some may experience aches and pains, and appetite change; some may feel sadness, anxiety, and fear; some may respond with decreased concentration or memory issues. All reactions can be normal. The important thing is to pay attention to how you are feeling, and if your symptoms become too severe, reach out for help.
