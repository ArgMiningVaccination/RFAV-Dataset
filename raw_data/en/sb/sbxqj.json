Online Herbalism & Wellness Coaching Appointments OVERVIEW Herbalism & Wellness Coaching appointments with Erika Galentin, MNIMH, RH (AHG) take place through our HIPAA compliant telehealth platform. After your initial meet & greet session, Erika will ask that you choose from either of the herbs & wellness coaching packages outlined below. Once your choice is confirmed, an invoice will be sent for payment. Upon receipt of payment towards your package, Erika will send you a link to her clinical forms as well as schedule you in for your first session. Please note that we do not accept insurance plans. Payment for consultations will be out-of-pocket and is due at the time of invoicing. You will be sent a link to a PayPal invoice which you can pay with a credit or debit card or through your PayPal account if you have one. Please note that payment plans are available. Alternatively, if you are unable to afford the cost of private consultations, we also offer a [monthly free herbal clinic](https://www.sovereigntyherbs.com/freeclinic). INITIAL CONSULTATIONS Your first appointment will last approximately 90 minutes during which time we will go through your full history including any previous or current wellness concerns and challenges as well as dietary/nutritional and lifestyle practices. During this time we will also begin the process of setting health and wellness goals and developing an integrated herbal, nutritional, and lifestyle protocol to support you in achieving those goals. After the consultation you will receive written guidance, via email, regarding any nutritional, lifestyle, and herbal suggestions discussed. Ongoing Support APPOINTMENTS & check-ins Your first return appointment is usually scheduled within 2-4 weeks of your first consultation. These 60 minute sessions provide an opportunity to cover anything about your health and wellness challenges and goals that was not covered during your first session. This is also when an initial integrated wellness plan will be finalized Subsequent 60-minute sessions will be spent reviewing your progress, discussing any questions you may have about your personalized herbal protocol, and/or making any adjustments to your wellness goals and plan. Check-ins are 30 minute sessions which are typically scheduled towards the end of a package but can also be used in between return appointments to discuss challenges that come up along the way. CUSTOM BLENDED TEAS & HerBAL Extracts Please note that suggested herbs and supplements are not included in the cost of the consultation. You will have the option of purchasing herbs in the form of custom blended teas and tinctures from us directly at an additional cost to our consultation fee (see FAQ's below for more information about cost of herbs and supplements). If you locally, you will have the option of picking your herbs up from Sovereignty Herbs to avoid shipping costs. If you live within the United States, we can ship tea and tincture blends to you at an additional cost. At this time, we are unable to ship tea and tincture blends internationally.

Erika has over 15 years of clinical experience working with all sorts of people. You can read more about her background [here](/erika-and-brooke). + What are the benefits of seeing a clinical herbalist? In simple terms, one of the benefits of seeing a clinical herbalist is guidance and education. Working with someone who has been trained in medical sciences and herbalism can be incredibly enlightening and empowering. It can also ensure that you are making the safest and most educated decisions possible about using herbs to support your health and wellbeing. Clinical herbalists, like Erika Galentin, have extensive knowledge and experience working with herbs in a clinical setting; they know the herbs well and the best form to take them in. They are able to interpret scientific research and assess potential for herb-drug interactions. They are also able to provide an objective perspective on the 'bigger picture' of your wellness journey that you may not be able to cultivate on your own. In addition to specializing in the clinical application of herbs, clinical herbalists appreciate their clients as individuals with sometimes very complex stories to tell. There is a built-in understanding that our life experiences can shape and craft our physical wellbeing. You will have the opportunity to share your concerns, your joys, your sadness, your stress, in a safe and supportive environment. Many people believe that part of healing comes with sharing your story and being heard. Clinical herbalists are able to provide this safe space, when many other healthcare practitioners cannot. Please also see our [FAQs about Clinical Herbalism](/frequently-asked-questions). + How do I prepare for my first appointment? Upon booking your first appointment, you will be emailed a private link on our website to 'Clinical Documents' that need to be filled out and sent back to our office via mail or email at least 5 days prior to your first appointment. Please also send in advance any pathology reports, scan reports, and pertinent blood work reports. Please ensure that all reports are in chronological order. It is also of utmost importance to include any and all pharmaceutical medications and dietary supplements on your client intake form. These forms, although extensive, are designed to provide Erika Galentin with as much information about your health history and wellness status prior to your first appointment so that your time together in consultation is as productive as possible. These forms also give you, the client, and opportunity to 'take stock' of your health and wellness goals. Knowing what you would like to achieve through seeing a clinical herbalist is the first step to reclaiming your own health sovereignty. Again, it is important that all forms and reports are sent to our office prior to your first appointment so that consultation time is not used up by going through them and that Erika Galentin is prepared and able to focus on your story. + If I email or leave a phone message when can I expect a reply? Phone calls and emails are generally received and responded to Monday through Friday, from 9:00am - 5:00pm. Please note there can be a 24-48 hour response time during the week. We will respond to emails and phone calls received over the weekend beginning Monday morning. Our clinical package fees for new clients also includes a 15 minute phone or telehealth call, if required, within 2 weeks of your first appointment to address any questions or concerns that come up as you get started. This is not a follow up appointment and we will not discuss new aspects or findings from your case - it is purely for clarifying and coaching you on the protocol you have recently received. Outside of this time, Erika Galentin MNIMH, RH (AHG) may have to charge for time accrued speaking by phone or answering your emails. If you are having concerns regarding your herbal protocol, you may be asked to consider booking another appointment (30-60 minute session) so that all of your concerns can be addressed appropriately. If you feel you need to speak with Erika Galentin immediately, please call our office and leave a message. She will return your call as soon as she is able. If you are having an emergency, stop all herbs and supplements, and head to your nearest Urgent Care facility. + What is the cost for herbs? The cost of herbs is NOT included in the consultation price. Although you are not expected or required to purchase herbal supplements from us, our prices reflect our desire to keep herbalism accessible and affordable for our clients. If you prefer to purchase herbal supplements elsewhere, we can recommend other sources, but can not guarantee pricing or quality of those products. As each person is unique, so will be the herbs we suggest for you. These may be alcoholic extracts or dried herbs for tea, or a combination of both. We will discuss herbal recommendations in consultation to figure out what will work best for you and your budget. On average, pricing can range from $40 - $120 / month. If you are an online client living within the United States, personalized herbal blends can be shipped to you for an additional cost of $12.00 - $20.00 + tax which will be added to the total cost of your herbs. Please note that payment must be received prior to us shipping your custom herbal blends. + Where do I purchase supplements?
