[[5]](#cite_note-5) [[6]](#cite_note-auto-6) He also founded the Good News Doctor Foundation, which aimed to combine [Christian](/wiki/Christianity) beliefs with his medical practice. [[7]](#cite_note-7) Education and career[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Jeff_Bradstreet&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] Bradstreet obtained a [Florida](/wiki/Florida) [medical license](/wiki/Medical_license) in 1984. He received a [Bachelor of Science](/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science) degree from the [University of South Florida](/wiki/University_of_South_Florida) in 1976, where he also went to medical school beginning three years later. His postgraduate research focused on aerospace medicine, and he received his training in this field from [Wilford Hall Medical Center](/wiki/Wilford_Hall_Medical_Center). He was an adjunct professor of child development and neuroscience at the [Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine](/wiki/Southwest_College_of_Naturopathic_Medicine) in [Tempe](/wiki/Tempe,_Arizona), [[8]](#cite_note-8) Autism claims and treatments[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Jeff_Bradstreet&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Bradstreet published [autism](/wiki/Autism) research, which he claimed indicated [vaccines as a cause](/wiki/Vaccine_controversies#Autism_controversies), in the fringe partizan [Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons](/wiki/Journal_of_American_Physicians_and_Surgeons), which is not indexed by [PubMed](/wiki/PubMed). This research claimed that autistic children had a higher body burden of [mercury](/wiki/Mercury_(element)), [[9]](#cite_note-9) and that three autistic children had [measles](/wiki/Measles) their [cerebrospinal fluid](/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid). [[10]](#cite_note-10) The [Institute of Medicine](/wiki/Institute_of_Medicine) has rejected any relationship between vaccines and autism. [[11]](#cite_note-IOM-11) Bradstreet treated Colten Benevento a child diagnosed with autism (one of the test cases in the [autism omnibus trial](/wiki/Autism_omnibus_trial)) with [chelation therapy](/wiki/Chelation_therapy) on the premise of removing mercury from his body, in spite of the fact that hair, blood, and urine tests had failed to show he exhibited abnormal levels of mercury. [[12]](#cite_note-Quackwatch-12) Over an eight-year period, Colten visited Bradstreet's office 160 times. [[13]](#cite_note-13) [Stephen Barrett](/wiki/Stephen_Barrett) has stated, \"It appears to me that Bradstreet decides which of his nonstandard theories to apply and records diagnoses that embody them,\" and describes Bradstreet's mercury provoked tests as \"phony\". [[12]](#cite_note-Quackwatch-12) [Peter Hotez](/wiki/Peter_Hotez) characterized Bradstreet's proposal to treat autism with chelation therapy as \"dangerous.\" [[6]](#cite_note-auto-6) In an interview with the [Chicago Tribune](/wiki/Chicago_Tribune), Bradstreet defended the use of [intravenous immunoglobulin](/wiki/Intravenous_immunoglobulin) (IVIG) as an autism treatment, saying, \"Every kid with autism should have a trial of IVIG if money was not an option and IVIG was abundant.\" [[14]](#cite_note-14) Bradstreet also published research regarding the use of [hyperbaric oxygen therapy](/wiki/Hyperbaric_oxygen_therapy) for autism, [[15]](#cite_note-15) some of which concluded it was ineffective, [[16]](#cite_note-16) as well as a paper arguing that autistic children have an increased vulnerability to [oxidative stress](/wiki/Oxidative_stress). [[17]](#cite_note-17) Further treatments Bradstreet used on autistic children included the controversial protein [GcMAF](/wiki/GcMAF), with which he claimed to have treated 600 children. [[18]](#cite_note-18) In an article for an anti-vaccine magazine, Bradstreet endorsed [stem cell therapy](/wiki/Stem_cell_therapy) as an autism treatment. [[19]](#cite_note-19) Personal life and death[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Jeff_Bradstreet&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] Bradstreet was found dead from a gunshot wound to the chest in the Broad River in [Rutherford County](/wiki/Rutherford_County,_North_Carolina), [North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina) in June 2015, after his [Buford](/wiki/Buford,_Georgia), [Georgia](/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)) medical office was raided by the [FDA](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) in connection with an investigation into GcMAF treatments. [[4]](#cite_note-alastairjamieson-4) [[20]](#cite_note-20) [[21]](#cite_note-21) At the time of his death, he lived in [Braselton](/wiki/Braselton,_Georgia) and ran his medical practice in Buford. [[4]](#cite_note-alastairjamieson-4) While the police declared Bradstreet's death a [suicide](/wiki/Suicide), a [theory](/wiki/Theory) has spread holding that Bradstreet was murdered for his use of a \"holistic\" therapy. [[22]](#cite_note-cansoc-22) Bradstreet's son has been diagnosed with autism, which Bradstreet attributed to a vaccination his son received at age 15 months. [[23]](#cite_note-23) N.
