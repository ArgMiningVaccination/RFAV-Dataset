It greatly cheers the drooping spirit, clears the face from clouds, smooths the wrinkled brow, checks moroseness, promotes hilarity; of all the most pleasant things in the world, nothing more delights and enlivens the human heart. ~ Giraldus Cambrensis The use of sound healing therapy is not just a [new age phenomenon](https://lonerwolf.com/new-age-movement/) but extends back thousands of years into the ancient times where [mystical](https://lonerwolf.com/what-is-a-mystic/) instruments of all kinds were used to remedy illnesses and revive the spirit. From the Aboriginal use of the yidaki (or didgeridoo) to heal physical ailments, to the ancient oriental use of the gong for spiritual attunement, music therapy has been used in many cultures and traditions for thousands of years. So how can the use of sound healing therapy help you? Well, sound is a vibration, and as we already know all of life exists at its core as vibrating atoms. Depending on the instrument, we can be influenced on a cellular level by the vibrations transmitted. Some instruments in particular - (those that we will be exploring today) - help us to move from what are known as \"Beta Brain Wave Patterns\", or those associated with concentration, anxiety and flight or fight reflexes, to calmer frequencies known as \"Alpha\", \"Theta\" and even \"Delta\" brain waves. These brain waves are associated with relaxation (Alpha), meditation (Theta) and trance-like states (Delta). So what does this mean? This means that you can access more reviving, rejuvenating and serene states of mind simply by listening to, or learning to play, certain musical instruments. This in turn promotes: - More mental, emotional and physical balance. - Reduced stress and anxiety. - Improved concentration and memory. - Improved sleep. - Enhanced immunity. - Greater creativity. - Heightened [spirituality](https://lonerwolf.com/what-is-spirituality/). In truth, sound healing is one of the most easily accessible and inexpensive forms of therapy and healing - something you can easily gift yourself with, or even learn to play.
