I specialise in natural anti-aging skincare methods, alternatives to Botox and surgery that are effective and non toxic. Combining the wisdom of the ancients with modern research and knowledge I bring you the optimal treatment. I have studied complementary medicine for over 20 years, gradually adding new modalities that reach deeper and are more efficient. I have studied with the Association of Reflexologists, the International Federation of Professional Aromatherapists, ITEC and most recently with the College of Naturopathic Medicine. I am a licensed acupuncturist and a member of the AFPA, IRI, and I comply with Best Practice and Codes of Ethics. Treatments can be claimed back from your health insurer; contact your provider for further details. I continue to develop my skills and knowledge through further training. I love to empower and educate my clients to manage their particular health issues in the best way possible for them. Reviews from satisfied clients \"I'm still walking on clouds after an amazing zone facelift treatment with Una. For more than 12 years I have treated myself with an hour for myself with Una. Whether I needed a full body massage, reflexology, acupuncture and now facial reflexology. You might say I'm addicted, I think I just need to listen to my body as our life is so very busy all the time. I can't recommend Una enough, her knowledge, her touch and the tools she gives you to use are amazing. Thanks Una for being a part of my life\" LB \"I have had rosacea for 28 years and nothing was helping the flare ups. The treatments allowed me some much needed me time which is always a plus. I found my breakouts less frequent, my skin calmer and smoother and my jowls almost non-existent. Although I had to stop my sessions due to family illness 12 months ago I've found the positive results to be permanent. I would definitely recommend such a relaxing, positive journey with a full holistic body, mind and soul experience.\" GK \"I had stress related problems. After the treatment I felt and looked relaxed, more rested, healthier. I loved the result I got. I would recommend a treatment to anyone, Una is very professional, knowledgeable, considerate and gentle.\" AB "}
