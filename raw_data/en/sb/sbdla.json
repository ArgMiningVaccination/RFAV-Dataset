There are different types of Medicare health plans. Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) is a Medicare Advantage HMO Plan (HMO stands for Health Maintenance Organization). Like all Medicare health plans, this Me dicare HMO is approved by Medicare and run by a private company. What is the Evidence of Coverage booklet about? This Evidence of Coverage booklet tells you how to get you r Medicare medical care and prescription drugs covered through our pla n. This booklet explains your rights and responsibilities, what is covered, and what you pay as a member of the plan. This plan, Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO), is offered by Health Net of California, Inc. (When this Evidence of Coverage says \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our,\" it means Health Net of California, Inc . When it says \"plan\" or \"our plan,\" it means Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) .) The words \"coverage\" and \"covered services \" refer to the medical care and services and the prescription drugs available to you as a member of H ealth Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO). What does this section tell you? Look through this section of your Evidence of Coverage to learn: What makes you eligible to be a plan member? What is your plan's service area? What materials will you get from us? What is your plan premium and how can you pay it? How do you keep the information in your membership record up to date? 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Getting started as a member 2 What if you are new to our plan? If you are a new member, then it's important for you to learn what the plan's rules are and what services are available to you. We encourage you to set aside some time to look through this Evidence of Coverage booklet. If you are confused or concerned or just have a question, please contact our plan's Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). Legal information about the Evidence of Coverage It's part of our contract with you This Evidence of Coverage is part of our contract with your employer or retiree group about how we cover your care. Other parts of this c ontract include your enrollment form, the List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) , and any notices you receive from us about changes to your coverage or conditions th at affect your coverage. These notic es are sometimes called \"riders\" or \"amendments.\" The contract is in effect for months in whic h you are enrolled in Hea lth Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO). Each plan year, Medicare allows us to make cha nges to the plans that we offer. This means we can change the costs and benefits of Health Ne t Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) at the end of each plan year. We can also choose to stop offering the plan, or to offer it in a different service area at the end of each plan year. Medicare must approve our plan each year Medicare (the Centers for Medica re & Medicaid Services) must a pprove our plan each year. You can continue to get Medicare coverage as a member of our plan as long as we choose to continue to offer the plan and Medicare re news its approval of the plan. What makes you eligible to be a plan member? Your eligibility requirements You are eligible for membership in our plan as long as: You live in our geographic service area (see th e \"Here is the plan service area for our plan\" portion below for the desc ription of our service area) -- and -- you have both Medicare Pa rt A and Medicare Part B 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Getting started as a member 3 -- and -- you do not have End-Stage Renal Dise ase (ESRD), with limited exceptions, such as if you develop ESRD when you are alre ady a member of a plan that we offer, or you were a member of a differe nt plan that was terminated -- and - you meet any additional eligibility requir ements of your employer's or union's benefit administrator. If you currently pay a premium for Medicare Part A and/or Medicare Part B, you must continue to pay your premium in order to keep your Medicare Part A and/or Medicare Part B and to remain a member of this plan. For additional information, see: \"University of California - Eligibility, Enrollment, Termination and Plan Administrati on Provisions\" section What are Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B? When you first signed up for Medicare, you rece ived information about what services are covered under Medicare Part A a nd Medicare Part B. Remember: Medicare Part A generally helps cover serv ices provided by hospitals (for inpatient services, skilled nursing facilitie s or home health agencies). Medicare Part B is for most other medical services (such as physician's services and other outpatient services) and certain items (such as durable medical equipment and supplies). Here is the plan service area for our plan Although Medicare is a Federal prog ram, our plan is available only to individuals who live in our plan service area. To remain a member of our plan, you must continue to reside in the plan service area. The service ar ea is described below. Our service area includes thes e counties in California: Alameda County Contra Costa County Fresno County Kern County Los Angeles County Orange County Placer County, the following Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Getting started as a member 4 Riverside County Sacramento County San Bernardino County San Diego County San Francisco County San Joaquin County San Mateo County Santa Barbara, the following ZIP Solano County Sonoma County Stanislaus County Tulare County Yolo County If you plan to move out of the service area, pl ease contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). Wh en you move, you will have a Special Enrollment Period that will allow you to switch to Original Me dicare or enroll in a Medicare health or drug plan that is available in your new location. It is also important that you call Social Securi ty if you move or change your mailing address. You can find phone numbers and contact information for Social Security in the \"Important phone numbers and resources\" section of this booklet. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Getting started as a member 5 What other materials will you get from us? Your plan membership card - Use it to get all covered care and prescription drugs While you are a member of our plan, you must use your membership card for our plan whenever you get any services covered by this plan a nd for prescription drugs you get at network pharmacies. Here's a sample membership ca rd to show you what yours will look like: As long as you are a member of our plan, you must not use your red, white, and blue Medicare card to get covered medical serv ices (with the exception of routine clinical research studies and hospice services). Keep your red, white , and blue Medicare card in a safe place in case you need it later. Here's why this is so important: If you get covered services using your red, white, and blue Medicare card instead of using your plan me mbership card while you are a plan member, you may have to pay the full cost yourself. If your plan membership card is damaged, lost, or stolen, call Me mber Services right away and we will send you a new card. (Phone numbers for Me mber Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) The Provider Directory : Your guide to all provid ers in the plan's network The Provider Directory lists our network providers. What are \"network providers\"? Network providers are the doctors and other health care professionals, medical groups, hospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement with us to accept our payment and any plan cost-sharing as payment in full. We have arranged for these providers to deliver covered services to members in our plan. Why do you need to know which pr oviders are part of our network? It is important to know which providers are part of our network because, with limited exceptions, while you are a member of our plan, you must us e network providers to get your medical care 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Getting started as a member 6 and services. In addition, you ma y be limited to providers within your Primary Care Provider's (PCP's) and/or Medical Group's network. This m eans that the PCP and/or Medical Group that you choose may determine the specialists and hosp itals you can use. See the \"Using the plan's coverage for your medical services\" section of this booklet for more information about choosing a PCP. The only exceptions are emergencies, ur gently needed care when the network is not available (generally, when you are out of the area), out-of-area di alysis services, and cases in which our plan authorizes use of out-of-network providers . See the \"Using the plan's coverage for your medical services\" section of this booklet for more specific information about emergency, out-of-network, a nd out-of-area coverage. If you don't have your copy of the Provider Directory , you can request a copy from Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). You may ask Member Services for more information about our netw ork providers, including th eir qualifications. You can also see the Provider Directory at www.healthnet.com/uc, or download it from this website. Both Member Services and the website can gi ve you the most up-to-date information about changes in our network providers. The Pharmacy Directory : Your guide to pharmacies in our network What are \"network pharmacies\"? Our Pharmacy Directory gives you a complete list of our netw ork pharmacies - that means all of the pharmacies that have agreed to fill c overed prescriptions for our plan members. Why do you need to know about network pharmacies? You can use the Pharmacy Directory to find the network pharmacy you want to use. This is important because, with few exceptions, you must get your prescriptions filled at one of our network pharmacies if you want our pl an to cover (help you pay for) them. If you don't have the Pharmacy Directory , you can get a copy from Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). At any tim e, you can call Member Services to get up-to-date information about cha nges in the pharmacy network. You can also find this information on our website at www.healthnet.com/uc. The plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) The plan has a List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) . We call it the \"Drug List\" for short. It tells which prescription drugs are covered by our plan. Th e drugs on this list are selected by the plan with the help of a team of doctors and pharmacists. The list must meet requirements set by Medicare. Medicare has approved the Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Drug List. The Drug List also tells you if there are any rules that rest rict coverage for your drugs. We will send you a copy of the Drug List each year. To get the most complete and current information about which drugs are cove red, you can visit th e plan's website 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Getting started as a member 7 (www.healthnet.com/uc) or call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). The Part D Explanation of Benefits (the \"PART D EOB\"): Reports with a summary of payments made for your Part D prescription drugs When you use your Part D prescrip tion drug benefits, we will send you a summary report to help you understand and keep track of payments for your Part D prescripti on drugs. This summary report is called the Part D Explanati on of Benefits (or the \"PART D EOB\"). The Part D Explanation of Benefits tells you the total amount you, or others on your behalf, have spent on your Part D prescription drugs and the to tal amount we have paid for each of your Part D prescription drugs during the month. See th e \"What you pay for your prescription drugs\" section of this booklet, which gi ves more information about the Part D Explanation of Benefits and how it can help you keep track of your Part D drug coverage. An Part D Explanation of Benefits summary is also available upon request. To get a copy, please contact Member Services (phone numbers are pr inted on the back cover of this booklet). Your monthly premium for your plan How much is your plan premium? Your coverage is provided through contract w ith your current employer or former employer or union. Please contact the employer's or union's bene fits administrator for information about your plan premium. In addition, you must continue to pay your Medicare Part B premium (unless your Part B premium is paid for you by Me dicaid or another third party). In some situations, your plan premium could be less The \"Extra Help\" program helps people with li mited resources pay for their drugs. See the \"Important phone numbers and resources\" section of this booklet, which tells more about this program. If you qualify, enrolling in the program might lower your monthly plan premium. If you are already enrolled and ge tting help from this program, the information about premiums in this Evidence of Coverage may not apply to you . We send you a separate insert, called the \"Evidence of Coverage Rider for Pe ople Who Get \"Extra Help\" Paying for Part D Prescription Drugs\" (also known as the \"Low Income Subsidy Rider\" or the \"LIS Rider\"), which tells you about your drug coverage. If you don't receive this document, please call Member Services and ask for the LIS Rider. Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet. In some situations, your plan premium could be more In some situations, your plan premium could be more than the amount communicated to you by your employer or retiree group. This situation is described below. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Getting started as a member 8 Some members are required to pay a late enrollment penalty because they did not join a Medicare drug plan when they first became eligible or because they had a continuous period of 63 days or more when they didn' t have \"creditable\" pres cription drug coverage. (\"Creditable\" means the drug coverage is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare's standard prescripti on drug coverage.). For these members, the late enrollment penalty is billed separately from the plan's monthly premium. o If you are required to pay th e late enrollment penalty, the amount of your penalty depends on how long you waited before you enrolled in drug coverage or how many months you were without drug covera ge after you became eligible. See the \"Do you have to pay the Part D 'late en rollment penalty\" portion of the \"What you pay for your prescription drugs\" secti on of this booklet, which explains the late enrollment penalty. Many members are required to pay other Medicare premiums Many members are required to pay other Medicar e premiums. As explained in the \"What makes you eligible to be a plan member ?\" portion above, in order to be eligible for our plan, you must maintain your eligibility for Medicare Parts A an d B. For that reason, some plan members (those who aren't eligible for premium-free Part A) pay a premium for Medicare Part A. And most plan members pay a premium for Medicare Part B. You must continue paying your Medicare premiums to remain a member of the plan. Some people pay an extra amount for Part D beca use of their yearly income. This is known as Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts, also known as IRMAA. If your income is greater than $85,000 for an individual (or married i ndividuals filing separate ly) or greater than $170,000 for married couples, you must pay an extr a amount directly to the government (not the Medicare plan) for your Me dicare Part D coverage. If you are required to pay the extra amount and you do not pay it, you will be disenrolled from the plan and lo se prescription drug coverage. If you have to pay an extra amount, Social Security, not your Medicare plan, will send you a letter telling you what that extra amount will be. For more information about Part D premiums based on income, go to the \"Do you have to pay an extra Part D amount because of your income?\" portion of the \"What you pay for your prescription drugs\" secti on in this booklet. You can also visit http://www.medicare.gov on the Web or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY user s should call 1-877-486-2048. Or you may call Social Security at 1-800-772-12 13. TTY users should call 1-800-325-0778. Your copy of Medicare & You 2015 tells about the Medicare pr emiums in the section called \"2015 Medicare Costs.\" This explains how the Medi care Part B and Part D premiums differ for people with different incomes. Everyone with Medicare receives a copy of Medicare & You each year in the fall. Those new to Medicare receive it within a month after first signing up. You can also download a copy of Medicare & You 2015 from the Medicare website 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Getting started as a member 9 (http://www.medicare.gov). Or, you can order a printed copy by phone at 1-800-MEDICARE (1- 800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users call 1-877-486-2048. Can your monthly plan prem ium change during the year? In some cases, the part of the premium that you have to pay can change during the year. This happens if you become eligible for the \"Extra He lp\" program or if you lose your eligibility for the \"Extra Help\" program during the year. If a member qualifies for \"Extra Help\" with their prescription drug costs, the \"Extra Help\" progra m will pay part of the member's monthly plan premium. So a member who becomes eligible fo r \"Extra Help\" during th e year would begin to pay less towards their monthly premium. And a member who loses their eligibility during the year will need to start paying their full mont hly premium. You can find out more about the \"Extra Help\" program in the \"Important phone numbers and resources\" section under the \"Information about programs to help people pay for their Part D prescription drugs\" portion of this booklet. In addition, in some cases, you may need to start paying or may be able to stop paying a late enrollment penalty. (The late enrollment penalty may apply if you had a continuous period of 63 days or more when you didn't have \"creditable\" prescription drug coverage.) This could happen if you become eligible for the \"Extra Help\" progra m or if you lose your eligibility for the \"Extra Help\" program during the year: If you currently pay the late enrollment pena lty and become eligible for \"Extra Help\" during the year, you would be able to stop paying your penalty. If the \"Extra Help\" program is currently pa ying your late enrollment penalty and you lose your eligibility during the year, you would need to st art paying your penalty. You can find out more about the \"Extra Help\" program in the \"Important phone numbers and resources,\" section under the \"I nformation about programs to help people pay for their Part D prescription drugs\" portion of this booklet. Please keep your plan member ship record up to date How to help make sure that we have accurate information about you Your membership record has information from your enrollment form, including your address and telephone number.

(For more information about how our coverage works when you have other insurance, see the \"How ot her insurance works with our plan\" portion of this section.) Once each year, we will send you a letter that list s any other medical or drug insurance coverage that we know about. Please read over this informa tion carefully. If it is co rrect, you don't need to do anything. If the information is incorrect, or if you have other cove rage that is not listed, please call Member Services (phone numbers are pr inted on the back cove r of this booklet). 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Getting started as a member 11 We protect the privacy of your personal health information We make sure that your health information is protected Federal and State laws protect the privacy of your medical records and personal health information. We protect your personal health information as required by these laws. For more information about how we protect your personal health information, please go to the \"We must protect the privacy of your personal hea lth information\" portio n in the \"Your rights and responsibilities\" sect ion of this booklet. How other insurance works with our plan Which plan pays first when you have other insurance? When you have other insurance (like employer gr oup health coverage), there are rules set by Medicare that decide whether our plan or your othe r insurance pays first. The insurance that pays first is called the \"primary paye r\" and pays up to the limits of its coverage. The one that pays second, called the \"secondary payer,\" only pays if there are costs left uncovered by the primary coverage. The secondary payer may not pay all of the uncovered costs. These rules apply for employer or union group health plan coverage: If you have retiree coverage, Medicare pays first. If your group health plan coverage is ba sed on your or a family member's current employment, who pays first depends on your age, the number of people employed by your employer, and whether you have Medicare based on age, disability, or End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): o If you're under 65 and disabled and you or your family member is still working, your plan pays first if the employer has 100 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 100 employees. o If you're over 65 and you or your spouse is still working, the plan pays first if the employer has 20 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 20 employees. o If you have Medicare because of ESRD, your group health plan will pay first for the first 30 months after you b ecome eligible for Medicare. These types of coverage usually pay fi rst for services related to each type: No-fault insurance (includi ng automobile insurance) Liability (including automobile insurance) 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Getting started as a member 12 Black lung benefits Workers' compensation Medicaid and TRICARE never pay first for Me dicare-covered services . They only pay after Medicare, employer group health pl ans, and/or Medigap have paid. If you have other insurance, tell your doctor, hospital, and pharma cy. If you have questions about who pays first, or you need to update your othe r insurance information, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). You may need to give your plan member ID number to your other insurers (once you have confirmed their identity) so your bills are paid correctly and on time. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Important phone numbers and resources 13 IMPORTANT PHONE NU MBERS AND RESOURCES Our plan contacts (how to contact us, including how to reach Member Services at the plan) How to contact our pl an's Member Services For assistance with claims, billing or member car d questions, please call or write to our plan's Member Services.

It gives definitions of terms and explains the rules you will need to follow to get the medical treatments, services, and other medi cal care that are c overed by the plan. For the details on what medical care is covered by our plan and how much you pay when you get this care, use the Medical Benefits Chart in the next section, \"Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay).\" What are \"network providers\" and \"covered services\"? Here are some definitions that can help you und erstand how you get the care and services that are covered for you as a member of our plan: \"Providers\" are doctors and other health care pr ofessionals licensed by the state to provide medical services and care. The term \"providers\" also include s hospitals and other health care facilities. \"Network providers\" are the doctors and other hea lth care professionals, medical groups, hospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement with us to accept our payment and your cost-sharing amount as payment in full. We have arranged for these providers to deliver cove red services to members in our plan. The providers in our network generally bill us directly for care they give you. When you see a network provider, you usually pay only your shar e of the cost for their services. \"Covered services\" include all the medical care, h ealth care services, supplies, and equipment that are covered by our plan. Your covered services for medical care are listed in the Medical Benefits Chart in the \"Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section of this booklet. Basic rules for getting your medical care covered by the plan As a Medicare health plan, we must cover all services covered by Original Medicare and must follow Original Medicare's coverage rules. We will generally cover your medical care as long as: The care you receive is included in th e plan's Medical Benefits Chart (this chart is in the \"Medical Benefits Chart (w hat is covered and what you pa y)\" section of this booklet). The care you receive is considered medically necessary . \"Medically necessary\" means that the services, supp lies, or drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of your medical condition and meet accep ted standards of medical practice. You have a network primary care provi der (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. As a member of our plan, you must choose a network PCP (for 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 32 more information about this, see the \"You must choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP) to provide and oversee your medical ca re\" portion of this section). o In most situations, our plan or your Me dical Group must give you approval in advance before you can use other provide rs in the plan's network, such as specialists, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities , or home health care agencies. This is called giving you a \"referral.\" For more info rmation about this, see the \"How to get care from specialists and other network providers,\" portion of this section. o Referrals from your PCP are not required for emergency care or urgently needed care. There are also some other kinds of care you can get without having approval in advance from your PCP (for more inform ation about this, see the \"What kinds of medical care can you get without getting approval in advance from your PCP?\" portion of this section). You must receive your care from a network provider (for more information about this, see the \"Use providers in the plan's ne twork to get your medical care\" portion in this section). In most cases, care you receive fr om an out-of-network provider (a provider who is not part of our plan's network) will not be covered. Here are three exceptions: o The plan covers emergency care or urgent ly needed care that you get from an out- of-network provider. For more informati on about this, and to see what emergency or urgently needed care means, see th e \"How to get covered services when you have an emergency or urgent need for care\" portion of this section. o If you need medical care that Medicare requ ires our plan to cover and the providers in our network cannot provide this care , you can get this care from an out-of- network provider. The plan or your Medi cal Group must give you approval in advance before you can use an out-of-netw ork provider. In th is situation, you will pay the same as you would pay if you got the care from a network provider.

You will get most of your routine or basic ca re from your PCP. Your PCP will also help you arrange or coordinate the rest of the covered servi ces you get as a member of our Plan. This includes: your x-rays, laboratory tests, therapies, care from doctors who are specialists, hospital admissions, and follow-up care. \"Coordinating\" your covered services includes check ing or consulting with other plan providers about your care and how it is going. If you need cer tain types of covered services or supplies, you must get approval in advance from your PCP (such as giving you a referral to see a specialist). For certain services, your PCP will n eed to get prior authorization (approval in advance). If the service you need requires prior authorization, your PCP will request the authorization from our plan or your Medical Gr oup. Since your PCP will provide and coordinate your medical care, you should have all of your pa st medical records sent to your PCP's office. As we explained above, you will usually see your PCP first for most of your routine health care needs. When your PCP thinks that you need specia lized treatment, he or she will need to give you a referral (approval in advance) to see a plan specialist or certai n other providers. There are only a few types of covered services you may get withou t getting approval from your PCP first, as we explain below. Please refer to the \"How to get ca re from specialists and other network providers\" and \"What kinds of medical care can you get w ithout getting approval in advance from your PCP?\" portions in this section for more information. How do you choose your PCP? When you enroll in our plan, you will choose a c ontracting Medical Gro up from our network. You will also choose a PCP from this contrac ting Medical Group. The PCP you choose must be with a Medical Group located w ithin 30 miles or 30 minutes from where you live or work. Medical Groups (and their affiliated PC Ps and hospitals) can be found in the Provider Directory or you may visit our website at www .healthnet.com/uc. To confirm th e availability of a provider, or to ask about a specific PCP, please contact Member Services at the phone number printed on the back cover of this booklet. Each Medical Group and PCP make s referrals to certain plan specialists and uses certain hospitals within their network. If th ere is a particular plan speciali st or hospital that you want to use, check first to be sure that the specialists and/or hospitals are in the Medical Group's and 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 34 PCP's network. The name and office telephone number of your PCP are printed on your membership card. If you do not choose a Medical Group or PCP or if you chose a Medical Group or PCP that is not available with this plan, we will automatically assign you to a Medical Group and PCP near your home. For information on how to change your PC P, please see \"Changing your PCP\" below. Changing your PCP You may change your PCP for any reason, at any time. Also, it's possible that your PCP might leave our plan's network of providers and you would have to find a new PCP. Your request will be effective on the first day of the month following the date our plan receives your request. To change your PCP, call Memb er Services or visit our website at www.healthnet.com/uc to make your request. When you contact us, be sure to let us know if you are seeing specialists or getting other covered services that needed your PCP' s approval (such as home health services and durable medical equipment). Member Services will let you know how you can continue with the specialty care and other services you have been getting when you change your PCP. Member Services will also check to be sure the PCP you want to switch to is accepting new patients. Your membership record will be changed to show the name of your new PCP, and Member Services will tell you when the change to your new PCP will take effect. They will also send you a new membership card that shows the name and phone number of your new PCP. What kinds of medical care can you ge t without getting approval in advance from your PCP? You can get services such as those listed be low without getting approval in advance from your PCP. Routine women's health care, which include s breast exams, screening mammograms (x- rays of the breast), Pap tests, and pelvic exams, as long as you get them from a network provider. Flu shots and pneumonia vaccinations, as long as you get them from a network provider. Emergency services from network provide rs or from out-of-network providers. Urgently needed care from in-network provide rs or from out-of-ne twork providers when network providers are temporarily unavai lable or inaccessible, e.g., when you are temporarily outside of th e plan's service area. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 35 Kidney dialysis services that you get at a Medi care-certified dialysis facility when you are temporarily outside the plan's service ar ea. (If possible, please call Member Services before you leave the service area so we can help arrange for you to have maintenance dialysis while you are away. Phone numbers fo r Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) When possible, please let us know before you leave the service area where you are going to be so we can help arrange for you to have maintenance dialysis while outside the service area. How to get care from specialists and other network providers A specialist is a doctor who provide s health care services for a specific disease or part of the body. There are many kinds of specia lists. Here are a few examples: Oncologists care for pa tients with cancer. Cardiologists care for patient s with heart conditions. Orthopedists care for patients with certa in bone, joint, or muscle conditions. In order for you to see a specia list, you need to get your PCP' s approval first (this is called getting a \"referral\" to a specialist). It is very important to get a referral (approval in advance) from your PCP before you see a plan specialist or certain other provide rs (there are a few exceptions, including routine women's health care, as explained in the \"What kinds of medical care can you get without ge tting approval in advance from your PCP?\" portion in this section). If you don't have a referral (approval in advance) before you get services from a specialist, you may have to pay for these services yourself. If the specialist wants you to come back for a dditional care, check first to be sure that the referral (approval in advance) you got from you r PCP for the first visi t covers additional visits to the specialist. Each Medical Group and PCP make s referrals to certain plan specialists and uses certain hospitals within their network. This means that the Medical Group and PCP you choose may determine the specialists and hospitals you may use. If there are specific sp ecialists or hospitals you want to use, find out if your Medical Group or PCP uses thes e specialists or hospitals. You may generally change your PCP at any time if yo u want to see a plan specialist or go to a hospital that your current PCP can 't refer you to. Earlier in this section, under \"Changing your PCP,\" we tell you how to change your PCP. Some types of services will require getting appr oval in advance from our plan or your Medical Group (this is called getting \"prior authorization\"). Prior authorization is an approval process that happens before you get certain se rvices. If the service you need requires prior au thorization, your PCP or other network provider will request the authorization from our plan or your Medical Group. The request will be reviewed and a decision (organization determination) will be sent to you and your provider. Please refer to the \"Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section in this booklet for specific benefits that require prior au thorization. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 36 What if a specialist or another network provider leaves our plan? We may make changes to the hospi tals, doctors, and speci alists (providers) that are part of your plan during the year. There are a number of r easons why your provider might leave your plan, but if your doctor or specialist does leave your plan you have cer tain rights and protections that are summarized below: Even though our network of providers may change during the year, Medicare requires that we furnish you with uninterrupted access to qualified doctors and specialists. When possible we will provide you with at least 30 days' notice that your provider is leaving our plan so that you have time to select a new provider. We will assist you in selecti ng a new qualified provider to continue managing your health care needs. If you are undergoing medical treatment, you have the right to request, and we will work with you to ensure, that the medically n ecessary treatment you are receiving is not interrupted. If you believe we have not furnished you w ith a qualified provider to replace your previous provider or that your care is not being appropriately managed, you have the right to file an app eal of our decision. If you find out your doctor or specialist is le aving your plan, please contact us so we can assist you in finding a new pr ovider and managing your care. If you need assistance because a specialist or a ne twork provider is leavi ng our plan, please call Member Services at the number liste d on the back cover of this booklet. How to get care from out-of-network providers If there is a certain type of se rvice that you need, and that servi ce is not available in our plan's network, you will need to get prior authorizati on (approval in advance) first. Your PCP will request prior authorization from our plan or your Medical Group. It is very important to get approval in advance before you s ee an out-of-network provider or receive services outside of our network (with the exception of emergency and urgently needed care, as explained in the \"How to get covere d services when you have an emergency or urgent need for care\" portion be low). If you don't get approval in advance, you may have to pay for these services yourself. For information on coverage of out-of-network em ergency and urgently needed care, please see the \"How to get covered services when you have an emergency or urgent need for care\" portion below. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 37 How to get covered services when you have an emergency or urgent need for care Getting care if you have a medical emergency What is a \"medical emergency\" a nd what should you do if you have one? A \"medical emergency\" is when you, or any other prudent layperson with an average knowledge of health and medicine, believe th at you have medical symptoms that require immediate medical attention to prevent loss of lif e, loss of a limb, or loss of function of a limb. The medical symptoms may be an illness, injury , severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly getting worse. If you have a medical emergency: Get help as quickly as possible. Call 911 for help or go to the nearest emergency room or hospital. Call for an ambulance if you need it. You do not need to get approval or a referral first from your PCP. As soon as possible, make sure that our plan has been told about your emergency. We need to follow up on your emergency care. You or someone else should call to tell us about your emergency care, usually within 48 hours. The phone number for Member Services is printed on the back cover of this booklet. It is also located on your membership card. What is covered if you have a medical emergency? You may get covered emergency medical care when ever you need it, anywhere in the United States or its territories. Our plan covers ambul ance services in situations where getting to the emergency room in any other way could endang er your health. For more information, see the Medical Benefits Chart in the \"Medical Benef its Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section of this booklet. You may get covered emergency medical care outs ide the United States. For more information, see \"Worldwide Emergency Coverage\" in the \"Medic al Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section in this Evidence of Coverage , or call Member Services at the phone number printed on the back cover of this booklet. If you have an emergency, we will talk with th e doctors who are giving you emergency care to help manage and follow up on your care. The doc tors who are giving you emergency care will decide when your condition is stable and the medical emergency is over. After the emergency is over, you ar e entitled to follow-up care to be sure your condition continues to be stable. Your follow-up care will be covered by our plan. If your emergency care is provided by out-of-network providers, we will arrange for network providers to take over your care as soon as your medical condition and the circumstances allow. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 38 What if it wasn't a medical emergency? Sometimes it can be hard to know if you have a medical emergency. For example, you might go in for emergency care - thinking that your health is in serious danger - and the doctor may say that it wasn't a medical emergency after all. If it turns out that it was not an emergency, as long as you reasonably thought your health was in se rious danger, we will cover your care. However, after the doctor has said that it was not an emergency, we will cover additional care only if you get the additional care in one of these two ways: You go to a network provider to get the additional care. - or - the additional care you get is considered \"urgently needed care\" and you follow the rules for getting this urgent care (for more information about this, see the \"Getting care when you have an urgent need for care\" portion of this section below). Getting care when you have an urgent need for care What is \"urgently needed care\"? \"Urgently needed care\" is a non-emergency, unfores een medical illness, injury, or condition that requires immediate medical care. Urgently needed care may be furnished by in-network providers or by out-of-network providers when network providers are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible. The unforeseen condition could, for ex ample, be an unforeseen flare-up of a known condition that you have. What if you are in the plan's service area when you have an urgent need for care? In most situations, if you are in the plan's servic e area, we will cover urgently needed care only if you get this care from a network provider and foll ow the other rules desc ribed earlier in this section. However, if the circumstances are unusua l or extraordinary, and network providers are temporarily unavailable or inacces sible, we will cover urgently needed care that you get from an out-of-network provider. What to do when you need medical care immediately In serious emergency situations: Call \"911\" or go to the nearest hospital. If your situation is not so se vere: Call your PCP or Medical Gr oup or, if you cannot call them or you need medical care right away, go to the near est medical center, urgent care center, or hospital. If you are unsure of whether an emergency medical condition exists, you may call your Medical Group or PCP for help. Your Medical Group is availabl e 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to respond to your phone calls regarding medical care that you believe is needed immediately. They will evaluate your situation and give you direction abou t where to go for the care you need. If you are not sure whether you have an emerge ncy or require urgent care, please contact a clinician by calling Decision Power\u00ae toll free at 1-800-893-55 97 (TTY/TDD: 1-800-276-3821) 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 39 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This phone number is also located on your member ID card. As a Health Net Member, you have access to triage or screening services, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What if you are outside the plan's service area when you have an urgent need for care? When you are outside the service area and cannot ge t care from a network provider, our plan will cover urgently needed care that you get from any provider. Urgently needed care received outside of the Un ited States may be considered an emergency under the worldwide emergency coverage benefit. For more information, see \"Worldwide Emergency Coverage\" in the \"Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section in this Evidence of Coverage , or call Member Services at the phone number printed on the back cover of this booklet. What if you are billed directly for the full cost of your covered services? You can ask us to pay our share of the cost of covered services If you have paid more than your share for covered services, or if you have received a bill for the full cost of covered medical services, see the \"Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical serv ices or drugs\" section in this booklet for information about what to do. If services are not covered by our plan, you must pay the full cost Our plan covers all medical services that are medi cally necessary, are listed in the plan's Medical Benefits Chart (this chart is in the \"Medical Be nefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section of this booklet), and are obtained consistent with plan rules. You are responsible for paying the full cost of services th at aren't covered by our plan, e ither because they are not plan covered services, or they were obtained out-of-network and were not authorized. If you have any questions about whether we will pa y for any medical service or care that you are considering, you have the right to ask us whether we will cover it before you get it. If we say we will not cover your services, you ha ve the right to appeal our d ecision not to cover your care. The \"What to do if you have a problem or compla int (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)\" section in this booklet has more information a bout what to do if you want a coverage decision from us or want to appeal a decision we have already made. You may also call Member Services to get more information about how to do this (ph one numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). For covered services that have a benefit limitation, you pay the full cost of any services you get after you have used up your benefit for that type of covered service. The amount you pay for the costs once a benefit limit has been reached will not count toward the out-of-pocket maximum. You can call Member Services when you want to know how much of you r benefit limit you have already used. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 40 How are your medical services co vered when you are in a \"clinical research study\"? What is a \"clinical research study\"? A clinical research study (also call ed a \"clinical trial\") is a way that doctors and scientists test new types of medical care, like how well a new can cer drug works. They test new medical care procedures or drugs by asking for volunteers to help with the st udy. This kind of study is one of the final stages of a research process that helps doctors and scientists see if a new approach works and if it is safe. Not all clinical research studies are open to me mbers of our plan. Medicar e first needs to approve the research study. If you pa rticipate in a study that Medicare has not approved, you will be responsible for paying all costs fo r your participation in the study. Once Medicare approves the study, someone who works on the study wi ll contact you to explain more about the study and see if you meet the requirements set by the scientists who are running the study. You can participate in the study as long as you meet the requirements for the study and you have a full understanding and acceptance of what is involved if you part icipate in the study. If you participate in a Medicare-a pproved study, Original Medicare pa ys most of the costs for the covered services you receive as part of the st udy. When you are in a c linical research study, you may stay enrolled in our plan and co ntinue to get the rest of your care (the care that is not related to the study) through our plan. If you want to participate in a Medica re-approved clinical research study, you do not need to get approval from our plan or your PCP. The providers that deliver your care as part of the clinical research study do not need to be part of our pl an's network of providers. Although you do not need to get our plan's permi ssion to be in a clinical research study, you do need to tell us before you start part icipating in a clinical research study. Here is why you need to tell us: 1. We can let you know whether the clini cal research study is Medicare-approved. 2. We can tell you what services you will get from clinical research study providers instead of from our plan. If you plan on participating in a clinical research study, cont act Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). When you participate in a clinical research stud y, who pays for what? Once you join a Medicare-approved clinical research study, you ar e covered for routine items and services you receive as part of the study, including: Room and board for a hospital stay that Medi care would pay for even if you weren't in a study. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 41 An operation or other medical procedure if it is part of the research study. Treatment of side effects and complications of the new care. Original Medicare pays most of the cost of the covered services you receiv e as part of the study. After Medicare has paid its share of the cost for these services, our plan will also pay for part of the costs. We will pay the difference between th e cost-sharing in Original Medicare and your cost-sharing as a member of our plan. This m eans you will pay the same amount for the services you receive as part of the study as you would if you received these services from our plan. Here's an example of how the cost sharing works: Let's say that you have a lab test that costs $100 as part of the research study. Let's also say th at your share of the costs for this test is $20 under Original Medicare, but the test would be $10 under our plan's benefits. In this case, Original Medicare would pay $80 fo r the test and we would pay a nother $10. This means that you would pay $10, which is the same amount you would pay under our plan's benefits. In order for us to pay for our share of the costs, you will need to submit a request for payment. With your request, you will need to send us a copy of your Medicare Summary Notices or other documentation that shows what services you rece ived as part of th e study and how much you owe. Please see the \"Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs\" section of this Evidence of Coverage for more information about submitting requests for payment. When you are part of a clinical research study, neither Medicare nor our plan will pay for any of the following : Generally, Medicare will not pay for the new item or serv ice that the study is testing unless Medicare would cover the ite m or service even if you were not in a study. Items and services the study gives you or any participant for free. Items or services provided only to collect da ta, and not used in your direct health care. For example, Medicare would not pay for mont hly CT scans done as part of the study if your medical condition would norma lly require only one CT scan. Do you want to know more? You can get more information about joining a c linical research study by reading the publication \"Medicare and Clinical Research Studies\" on the Medicare website (http://www.medicare.gov). You can also call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-63 3-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 42 Rules for getting care covered in a \"religious non-medical health care institution\" What is a religious non-medical health care institution? A religious non-medical health care institution is a facility that provides care for a condition that would ordinarily be treated in a hospital or skille d nursing facility. If getting care in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility is against a member's religious beliefs, we will instead provide coverage for care in a religious non-medical health care institution. You may choose to pursue medical care at any time for any reason. This benefit is pr ovided only for Part A inpatient services (non- medical health care services). Medicare will only pay for non-medical health care services provided by religious non-medical health care institutions. What care from a religious non-medical heal th care institution is covered by our plan? To get care from a religious non-medical health care institution, you must sign a legal document that says you are conscientiously opposed to getting medical trea tment that is \"non-excepted.\" \"Non-excepted\" medical care or treatment is any medical care or treatment that is voluntary and not required by any federal, state, or local law. \"Excepted\" medical treatment is medical care or treatment that you get that is not voluntary or is required under federal, stat e, or local law. To be covered by our plan, the care you get from a religious non-medical health care institution must meet the following conditions: The facility providing the care must be certified by Medicare. Our plan's coverage of servic es you receive is limited to non-religious aspects of care. If you get services from this institution that are provided to you in your home, our plan will cover these services only if your conditi on would ordinarily meet the conditions for coverage of services given by home health agencies that are not religious non-medical health care institutions. If you get services from this institution th at are provided to you in a facility, the following conditions apply: o You must have a medical condition that would allow you to receive covered services for inpatient hospital care or skilled nursi ng facility care. o - and - you must get approval in advance from our plan before you are admitted to the facility or your stay will not be covered. Coverage limits for Inpatient Hospital Care a pply. For more information on Inpatient Hospital Care coverage limits, see the Medical Benefits Ch art in the \"Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section of this booklet. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 43 Rules for ownership of durable medical equipment Will you own the durable medical equi pment after making a certain number of payments under our plan? Durable medical equipment includes items such as oxygen equipment and supplies, wheelchairs, walkers, and hospital beds ordered by a provider for use in the home. Certain items, such as prosthetics, are always owned by the member. In this section, we discuss other types of durable medical equipment that must be rented. In Original Medicare, people w ho rent certain types of durab le medical equipment own the equipment after paying copayments for the item for 13 months. As a member of our plan, there are also certain types of durable medical equipment you will own after paying copayments for the item for a sp ecified number of months. We follow Medicare guidelines for ownership of durable medical e quipment. Your previous payments towards a durable medical equipment item when you ha d Original Medicare do not count towards payments you make while a member of our plan. If you acquire ownership of a durable medical equipment item while you are a member of our pl an, the provider may bill you a maintenance fee every six months. There are also certain types of durable medical equipment of which you will not acquire ownership no matte r how many copayments you make for the item while a member of our plan. Call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) to find out about the rental or ownership requ irements of durable medical equipment and the documentation you need to provide. What happens to payments you have ma de for durable medical equipment if you switch to Original Medicare? If you switch to Original Medica re after being a member of ou r plan: If you did not acquire ownership of the durable medical equipment ite m while in our plan, you will have to make 13 new consecutive payments for the item while in Original Medicare in order to acquire ownership of the item. Your previous payments while in our plan do not count toward these 13 consecutive payments. If you made payments for the durable medical equipment item under Original Medicare before you joined our plan, these previous Original Me dicare payments also do not count toward the 13 consecutive payments. You will have to make 13 consecutive payments for the item under Original Medicare in order to acquire ownership. There are no exceptions to this case when you return to Original Medicare. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) 44 MEDICAL BENEFITS CHART (WHAT IS COVERED AND WHAT YOU PAY ) Understanding your out-of-pocket costs for covered services This section focuses on your covered services and what you pay for your medical benefits. It includes a Medical Benefits Char t that lists your cove red services and show s how much you will pay for each covered service as a member of our plan. Later in this section, you can find information about medical services that are not cove red. It also explains limits on certain services. Information about how much you pay for your Pres cription Drug Benefits is in the \"What you pay for your prescription drugs\" secti on of this Evidence of Coverage. Further exclusions can also be found in this section for members who have additional benefits. Types of out-of-pocket costs you ma y pay for your covered services To understand the payment information we give you in this section, you need to know about the types of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services. A \"copayment\" is the fixed amount you pay each time you receive certain medical services. You pay a copayment at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in this section te lls you more about your copayments.) \"Coinsurance\" means that you pay a percent of the to tal cost of a medi cal service. You pay a coinsurance at the time you get the medical service. (The \"Medical Benefits Chart\" in this section tells you mo re about your coinsurance.) Some people qualify for State Medicaid programs to help them pay their out-of-pocket costs for Medicare. (These \"Medicare Savings Programs\" include the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB), Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB), Qualifying Individual (QI), and Qualified Disabled & Working Individuals (QDWI) programs.) If you are enrolled in one of these programs, you may still have to pay a copa yment for the service, depending on the rules in your state. What is the most you will pay for covered medical services? Because you are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, there is a limit to how much you have to pay out-of-pocket each year for in-network medical services that are covered by our plan (see the Medical Benefits Chart in the \"Use this Medical Benefits Chart to find out what is covered for you and how much you will pay\" portion of this s ection below). This limit is called the maximum out-of-pocket amount for medical services. As a member of our plan, the most you will have to pay out-of-pocket for in-network covered services in 2015 is $1500. The amou nts you pay for the deductibles (i f applicable to your plan), copayments, and coinsurance for in-network cove red services count towa rd this maximum out-of-2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) 45 pocket amount. (The amounts you pay for any plan pr emiums (if applicable to your plan) and/or prescription drugs do not count toward your maximum out-of-pocket amount. In addition, amounts you pay for some services do not count toward your maximum out-of-pocket amount. These services are marked with a diamond () in the Medical Benefits Chart.) If you reach the maximum out-of-pocket amount of $1500, you will no t have to pay any out-of-pocket costs for the rest of the year for covere d services. However, you must con tinue to pay your plan premium (if applicable) and the Medicare Part B premium (unl ess your Part B premium is paid for you by Medicaid or another third party). Our plan does not allow providers to \"balance bill\" you As a member of our plan, an important protection for you is that, after you meet any applicable deductibles, you only have to pa y your cost-sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow providers to add additional separate ch arges called \"balance billing.\" This protection (that you never pay more than you r cost-sharing amount) applies even if we pay the provider less than the provide r charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don't pay certain provider charges. Here is how this protection works: If your cost sharing is a copayment (a se t amount of dollars, for example, $15.00), then you pay only that amount for any covered services from a network provider. If your cost sharing is a coin surance (a percentage of the total charges), then you never pay more than that percentage. However, your cost depends on which type of provider you see: o If you receive the covered services from a network provider, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the plan's reimbursement rate (as determined in the contract betw een the provider and the plan). o If you receive the covered services from an out-of-network provider who participates with Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for participating providers.

The \"Extra Help\" program helps people with limited resources pay for their drugs. For more information, see the por tion on Information about programs to help people pay for their prescription drugs in the \"Important phone numbers and resources\" section. Are you currently getting help to pay for your drugs? If you are in a program that helps pay for your drugs, some information in this Evidence of Coverage about the costs for Part D prescription drugs may not apply to you. We send you a separate insert, cal led the \"Evidence of Coverage Rider for People Who Get Extra Help Paying for Prescription Drugs\" (also known as the \"Low Income Subsidy Rider\" or the \"LIS Rider\"), which tells you about your drug coverage.

Introduction This section describes your coverage for drugs This section explains rules for using your coverage for drugs. Th e next section in this booklet, \"What you pay for your prescription dr ugs,\" tells what you pay for drugs . In addition to your coverage for Part D drugs, our plan covers so me drugs not covered by Part D. These drugs are included on our Drug List. The amount you pay when you fill a prescription for these drugs does not count towards qualifying yo u for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. The plan covers drugs you are given during covered stays in the hospital or in a skilled nursing facility. The \"Medical Benefits Chart (wha t is covered and what you pay)\" section in this booklet tells about the bene fits and costs for drugs during a covered hospital or skilled nursing facility stay. Medicare Part B also provides benefits fo r some drugs. Part B drugs include certain chemotherapy drugs, certain drug injections you are given during an office visit, and drugs you are given at a dialysis facility. Th e \"Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section of this booklet tell s about your benefits and costs for Part B drugs. In addition to the plan's prescription drug and medical benefits covera ge, your drugs may be covered by Original Medicare if you are in Me dicare hospice. For more information, see the \"What if you're in Medicare-certifie d hospice\" section in this booklet. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 119 Basic rules for the plan's drug coverage The plan will generally cover your drugs as long as you follow these basic rules: You must have a provider (a doctor or other prescriber) wr ite your prescription. Effective June 1, 2015, your prescriber must ei ther accept Medicare or file documentation with CMS showing that he or she is qualifie d to write prescriptions . You should ask your prescribers the next time you call or visit if they meet this condition. You generally must use a network pharmacy to fill your prescription. (See the \"Fill your prescription at a network pharmacy or th rough the plan's mail-order services\" portion of this section.) Your drug must be on the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) (we call it the \"Drug List\" for short). (See the \"Your dr ugs need to be on the plan's 'Drug List'\" portion of this section.) Your drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. A \"medically accepted indication\" is a use of the drug th at is either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or supported by cer tain reference books. (See the \"Your drugs need to be on the plan's 'Drug Li st'\" portion of this section for more information about a medically accepted indication.) Fill your prescription at a network pharmacy or through the plan's mail-order services To have your prescription covered, use a network pharmacy In most cases, your prescriptions are covered only if they are filled at the plan's network pharmacies. (See the \"When can you use a pharmacy that is not in the plan's network?\" portion of this section for information about wh en we would cover prescriptions filled at out- of-network pharmacies.) A network pharmacy is a pharmacy that has a cont ract with the plan to provide your covered prescription drugs. The term \"covered drugs\" means all of the prescription drugs that are covered on the plan's Drug List. Finding network pharmacies How do you find a network pharmacy in your area? To find a network pharmacy, you can look in your Pharmacy Directory , visit our website (www.healthnet.com/uc), or call Member Serv ices (phone numbers ar e printed on the back cover of this booklet). Choose whatever is easiest for you. You may go to any of our network pharmacies . If you switch from one network pharmacy to another, and you need a refill of a drug you have been taking, you can ask either to have a new 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 120 prescription written by a provider or to have your prescription tr ansferred to your new network pharmacy. What if the pharmacy you have been using leaves the network? If the pharmacy you have been using leaves th e plan's network, you will have to find a new pharmacy that is in the network. To find anot her network pharmacy in your area, you can get help from Member Services (phone numbers are on the back cover of th is booklet) or use the Pharmacy Directory . You can also find information on our website at www.healthnet.com/uc . What if you need a specialized pharmacy? Sometimes prescriptions must be filled at a specialized pharmacy. Specialized pharmacies include: Pharmacies that supply drugs for home infusion therapy. Pharmacies that supply drugs for reside nts of a long-term care (LTC) facility. Usually, a long-term care (LTC) facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy. Residents may get prescription dr ugs through the facility's pharmacy as long as it is part of our network. If your long-term care (LTC) pharmacy is not in our network, please contact Member Services. Pharmacies that serve the Indian Health Service / Tribal / Urban Indian Health Program. Except in emergencies, only Na tive Americans or Alaska Natives have access to these pharmacies in our network. Pharmacies that dispense drugs that are re stricted by the FDA to certain locations or that require special extraordinary handli ng, provider coordina tion, or education on their use. (Note: This scen ario should ha ppen rarely.) To locate a specialized pharmacy, look in your Pharmacy Directory or call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). Using the plan's mail-order services For certain kinds of drugs, you can use the plan 's network mail-order se rvices. Generally, the drugs provided through mail order are maintenance drugs that you ta ke on a regular basis, for a chronic or long-term medical condition. The dr ugs available through our plan's mail-order service are marked as \" mail-order\" drugs in our Drug List. Our plan's mail-order serv ice requires you to order at least a 30-day supply of the drug and no more than a 90-day supply .

After the pharmacy receives a prescription from a health care provider, it will contact you to see if you want the medication filled immediately or at a later time. This will give you an opportunity to make sure that the pharmacy is delivering the correct drug (including strength, amount, and form) and, if needed, allow you to stop or delay the order before you are billed and it is shipped. It is important that you respond each time you are contacted by the pharmacy, to let them know what to do with th e new prescription and to prev ent any delays in shipping.

How can you get a long-term supply of drugs? When you get a long-term supply of drugs, your cost sharing may be lower. The plan offers two ways to get a long-term supply of \"maintenan ce\" drugs on our plan's Drug List. (Maintenance drugs are drugs that you take on a regular basis, for a chronic or long-term medical condition.) 1. Some retail pharmacies in our network allow you to get a long-term supply of maintenance drugs. Your Pharmacy Directory tells you which pharmacies in our network can give you a long-term supply of main tenance drugs. You can also call Member Services for more information (phone number s are printed on the back cover of this booklet). 2. For certain kinds of drugs, you can use the plan's network mail-order services. The drugs available through our plan's ma il-order service are marked as \" mail-order\" drugs in our Drug List. Our plan's mail- order service requires you to order at least a 30-day supply of the drug and no more than a 90-day supply. See the \"Using the plan's mail- order services\" portion above for more inform ation about using our mail-order services. When can you use a pharmacy that is not in the plan's network? Your prescription may be cove red in certain situations 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 122 We have network pharmacies outside of our se rvice area where you can get your prescriptions filled as a member of our plan. Gene rally, we cover drugs filled at an out-of-network pharmacy only when you are not able to use a network pha rmacy. Here are the circumstances when we would cover prescriptions filled at an out-of-network pharmacy: There is no network pharmacy th at is close to you and open. You need a drug that you can't get at a network pharmacy close to you. You need a drug for emergency or urgent medical care. You must leave your home due to a federal disaster or other public health emergency In these situations, please check first with Member Services to see if there is a network pharmacy nearby. (Phone numbers for Member Servi ces are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) How do you ask for reimbursement from the plan? If you must use an out-of-network pharmacy, you will generally have to pay the full cost (rather than your normal share of the cost) at the ti me you fill your prescription. You can ask us to reimburse you for our share of the cost. See the \"How to ask us to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received\" portion of the \"Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs \" section of this booklet, which e xplains how to ask the plan to pay you back. Your drugs need to be on the plan's \"Drug List\" The \"Drug List\" tells which drugs are covered The plan has a List of Covered Drugs (Formulary). In this Evidence of Coverage , we call it the \"Drug List\" for short. The drugs on this list are selected by the plan w ith the help of a team of doctors and pharmacists. The list must meet requirements set by Medicare . Medicare has approved the plan's Drug List. We will generally cover a drug on the plan's Drug List as long as you follow the other coverage rules explained in this section and the use of the drug is a medically accepted indication. A \"medically accepted indication\" is a use of the drug that is either : approved by the Food and Drug Admini stration. (That is, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the drug for th e diagnosis or treatment of your medical condition and it meets the accepted standards of medical practice for which it is being prescribed.) -- or -- supported by certain reference books. (These reference books are the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Informati on, the DRUGDEX Information System, and the USPDI or its successor.) The Drug List includes both brand name and generic drugs 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 123 A generic drug is a prescription drug that has the same active ingredients as the brand name drug. Generally, it works just as well as the brand name drug, and usually it costs less. There are generic drug substitutes availa ble for many brand name drugs. What is not on the Drug List? The plan does not cover all prescription drugs. In some cases, the law does not allow any Medicare plan to cover certain types of drugs (for more information about th is, see the \"What types of drugs are not covered by the plan?\" porti on later in this section). In other cases, we have decided not to in clude a particular dr ug on the Drug List. There are different \"cost-sharing tiers\" for drugs on the Drug List Every drug on the plan's Drug List is on one of th e cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher the cost-sharing tier, the higher your cost for the dr ug. To find out what type of drugs are covered on each drug tier and your cost-sharing for each tier, refer to the \"What you pay for your prescription drugs\" sect ion later in this Evidence of Coverage. Tier 1 includes preferred generic drugs. Tier 2 includes preferred brand drugs. Drugs on this tier are not eligible for exceptions for payment at a lower tier. Tier 3 includes non-pr eferred brand drugs. Tier 4 (Injectable Drugs) includes injectable drugs that do not meet the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) minimum cost threshold required to be placed on the Specialty Tier (Tier 5). Tier 5 (Specialty Drugs) includes high cost drugs. Specialty drugs are not eligible for exceptions for payment at a lower tier. To find out which cost-sharing tier your drug is on, look it up in the plan's Drug List. The amount you pay for drugs in each cost-shari ng tier is shown in the \"What you pay for your prescription drugs\" section of this booklet. How can you find out if a speci fic drug is on the Drug List? You have three ways to find out: 1. Check the most recent Drug Li st we sent you in the mail. 2. Visit the plan's website (www.healthnet.co m/uc). The Drug List on the website is always the most current. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 124 3. Call Member Services to find out if a partic ular drug is on the plan's Drug List or to ask for a copy of the list. (Phone numb ers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) There are restrictions on coverage for some drugs Why do some drugs have restrictions? For certain prescription drugs, special rules restri ct how and when the plan covers them. A team of doctors and pharmacists devel oped these rules to help our me mbers use drugs in the most effective ways. These special rules also help co ntrol overall drug costs, which keeps your drug coverage more affordable. In general, our rules encourage you to get a dr ug that works for your medical condition and is safe and effective. Whenever a safe, lower-cost drug will work just as well medically as a higher-cost drug, the plan's rules are de signed to encourage you and your pr ovider to use that lower-cost option. We also need to comply with Medicare's rules and regulations for drug coverage and cost sharing. If there is a restriction for your drug, it usua lly means that you or your provider will have to take extra steps in ord er for us to cover the drug. If you want us to wa ive the restriction for you, you will need to use the coverage decision process and ask us to make an exception. We may or may not agree to waive the restriction for you. (See the \"What is an exception?\" portion of the \"What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)\" section of this booklet for information about asking for exceptions.) Please note that sometimes a drug may appear more than once in our drug list. This is because different restrictions or cost-s haring may apply based on factors su ch as the strength, amount, or form of the drug prescribed by your health care provider (for instance, 10 mg versus 100 mg; one per day versus two per day; tablet versus liquid). What kinds of restrictions? Our plan uses different types of restrictions to help our members use drugs in the most effective ways. The information below tells you more about the types of restrictio ns we use for certain drugs. Restricting brand name drugs when a generic version is available Generally, a \"generic\" drug works the same as a brand name drug and usually costs less. In most cases, when a generic version of a brand name drug is available, our network pharmacies will usually provide you the generic version. We usually will not cover the brand name drug when a generic version is available. However, if your provider has told us the medical reason that the generic drug will not work for you or ha s told us the medical reason that neither the generic drug nor other covered drugs that trea t the same condition will work for you, then we will cover the brand name drug. (Your share of th e cost may be greater for the brand name drug than for the generic drug.) 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 125 Getting plan approval in advance For certain drugs, you or your provider need to get a pproval from the plan before we will agree to cover the drug for you. This is called \"prior authorization.\" Sometimes the requirement for getting approval in advance help s guide appropriate us e of certain drugs. If you do not get this approval, your drug might not be covered by the plan. Trying a different drug first This requirement encourages you to try less costly but just as effective drugs before the plan covers another drug. For example, if Drug A a nd Drug B treat the same medical condition, the plan may require you to try Drug A first. If Drug A does not work for you, the plan will then cover Drug B. This requirement to try a different drug first is called \"step therapy .\" Quantity limits For certain drugs, we limit the amount of the dr ug that you can have. For example, the plan might limit how many refills you can get, or ho w much of a drug you ca n get each time you fill your prescription. For example, if it is normally cons idered safe to take only one pill per day for a certain drug, we may limit coverage for your pr escription to no more th an one pill per day. Do any of these restricti ons apply to your drugs? The plan's Drug List includes info rmation about the restrictions described above. To find out if any of these restrictions apply to a drug you take or want to ta ke, check the Drug List. For the most up-to-date information, call Member Serv ices (phone numbers ar e printed on the back cover of this booklet) or check our website (www.healthnet.com/uc). If there is a restriction for your drug, it usua lly means that you or your provider will have to take extra steps in ord er for us to cover the drug. If there is a restriction on the drug you want to take, you should contact Member Servic es to learn what you or your provider would need to do to get coverage for the drug. If you wa nt us to waive the restriction for you, you will need to use the coverage decision process and as k us to make an exception. We may or may not agree to waive the restriction for you. (See the \"W hat is an exception?\" portion of the \"What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage d ecisions, appeals, complain ts)\" section of this booklet for information about asking for exceptions.) What if one of your drugs is not cover ed in the way you'd like it to be covered? There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way you'd like it to be covered Suppose there is a prescription drug you are currently taking, or one that you and your provider think you should be taking. We hope that your dr ug coverage will work well for you, but it's possible that you might have a problem. For example: 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 126 What if the drug you want to ta ke is not covered by the plan? For example, the drug might not be covered at all. Or maybe a ge neric version of the drug is covered but the brand name version you want to take is not covered. What if the drug is covered, but there are ex tra rules or restrictio ns on coverage for that drug? As explained in the \"There are rest rictions on coverage for some drugs\" portion of this section, some of the drugs cove red by the plan have extra rules to restrict their use. For example, you might be required to try a different drug first, to see if it will work, before the drug you want to take will be covered for you. Or there might be limits on what amount of the drug (number of pills, etc.) is covered during a particular time period. In some cases, you may want us to waive the restriction for you. For example, you might want us to cover a certain drug for you without havi ng to try other drugs first. Or you may want us to cover more of a drug (number of pills, etc.) than we normally will cover. What if the Part D drug is covered, but it is in a cost-sharing tier that makes your cost sharing more expensive th an you think it should be? The plan puts each covered drug on one of the different cost-sharing tier s. How much you pay for your prescription depends in part on which cost-sharing tier your drug is on. There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way that you'd like it to be covered. Your options depend on what type of problem you have: If your drug is not on the Drug List or if your drug is restricted, see the \"What can you do if your Part D drug is not on the Drug List or if the drug is restri cted in some way?\" portion of this section to learn what you can do. If your Part D drug is on a cost-sharing tier that makes your cost more expensive than you think it should be, see the \"What can you do if your Part D drug is on a cost-sharing tier you think is too high?\" portion of th is section to learn what you can do. What can you do if your Part D drug is not on the Drug List or if the drug is restricted in some way? If your drug is not on the Drug List or is restricted, here are things you can do: You may be able to get a temporary supply of the Part D drug (only members in certain situations can get a temporar y supply). This will give you and your provider time to change to another drug or to file a request to have the drug covered. You can change to another drug. You can request an exception and ask the plan to cover the drug or remove restrictions from the drug. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 127 You may be able to get a temporary supply Under certain circumstances, the plan can offer a temporary supply of a Part D drug to you when your Part D drug is not on the Dr ug List or when it is restricted in some way. Doing this gives you time to talk with your provide r about the change in coverage and figure out what to do. To be eligible for a temporary supply of a Part D drug, you must meet the two requirements below: 1. The change to your Part D drug coverage must be one of the followi ng types of changes: The Part D drug you have been taking is no longer on the plan's Drug List . -- or -- the Part D drug y ou have been taking is now restricted in some way (the \"There are restrictions on coverage for some drugs\" portion of this section tells about restrictions). 2. You must be in one of the situations described below: For those members who were in the plan last year and aren't in a long-term care (LTC) facility: We will cover a temporary supply of your Part D drug during the first 90 days after the implementation of a new formulary at th e beginning of each year (January 1) . This temporary supply will be for a maximum of 30 da ys, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days and we will allow multiple f ills to provide up to a maximum of a 30-day supply of medication. The pr escription must be filled at a network pharmacy. For those members who are new to the plan and aren't in a long-term care (LTC) facility: We will cover a temporary supply of your Part D drug during the first 90 days of your membership in the plan. This temporary supply will be for a maximum of 30 days, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days and we will allow multiple fills to provide up to a maximum of a 30-day supply of medication. The prescription must be filled at a network pharmacy. For those members who were in the plan last year and reside in a long-term care (LTC) facility: We will cover a temporary supply of your drug during the first 90 days of the calendar year . The total supply will be for a maximum of a 102-day supply . If your prescription is written for fewer days, we will allow multiple fills to provide up to a maximum of a 102- day supply of medication. (Please note that the long-t erm care pharmacy may provide the drug in smaller amounts at a time to prevent waste.) For those members who are new to the plan and reside in a long-term care (LTC) facility: We will cover a temporary supply of your drug during the first 90 days of your membership in the plan. The total supply will be for a maximum of a 102-day supply. If your prescription is written for fewer days, we will allow multiple fills to provide up to a 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 128 maximum of a 102-day supply of medication. (Please note that the long-term care pharmacy may provide the drug in smaller am ounts at a time to prevent waste.). For those members who have been in the plan for more than 90 days and reside in a long-term care (LTC) facility and need a supply right away: We will cover one 34-day supply of your Part D drug, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days. This is in addition to the above long-term care (LTC) transition supply. For current members of the plan who are moving from a long-term care (LTC) facility or a hospital stay to home a nd need a transition supply right away: We will cover one 30-day supply of your Part D drug, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days (in which case we will allow multiple fills to provide up to a total of a 30-day supply of medication). For current members of the plan who are moving from home or a hospital stay to a long-term care (LTC) facility and need a transition supply right away: We will cover one 34-day supply of your Part D drug, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days (in which case we will allow multiple fills to provide up to a total of a 34-day supply of medication). To ask for a temporary supply of your Part D drug, call Member Servi ces (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). During the time when you are getting a temporary supply of a Part D drug, you should talk with your provider to decide what to do when your temporary supply runs out. You can either switch to a different Part D drug covered by the plan or ask the plan to make an exception for you and cover your current Part D dr ug. The sections below tell you more about these options. You can change to another drug Start by talking with your provider. Perhaps there is a different Part D drug covered by the plan that might work just as well for you. You can call Member Services to ask for a list of covered Part D drugs that treat the same medical cond ition. This list can help your provider to find a covered drug that might work for you. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) You can ask for an exception You and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception for you and cover the Part D drug in the way you would like it to be covered. If your provider says that you have medical reasons that justify asking us for an exception, your provider can help you request an exception to the rule. For example, you can ask the pl an to cover a Part D drug even though it is not on the plan's Drug List. Or you can ask the plan to make an exception and cover th e Part D drug without restrictions. If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, the \"Step-by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision, including an ex ception\" portion of the \"What to do if you have a problem or 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 129 complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints )\" section of this booklet tells what to do. It explains the procedures and dead lines that have been set by Medi care to make sure your request is handled promptly and fairly. What can you do if your Part D drug is on a cost-sharing tier you think is too high? If your Part D drug is on a cost-sharing tier you think is too high, here are things you can do: You can change to another Part D drug If your drug is on a cost-sharing tier you think is too high, start by talking with your provider. Perhaps there is a different Part D drug on a lowe r cost-sharing tier that mi ght work just as well for you. You can call Member Services to ask for a list of covered Part D drugs that treat the same medical condition. This list can he lp your provider find a covered Part D drug that might work for you.(Phone numbers for Member Services ar e printed on the back cover of this booklet.) You can ask for an exception For Part D drugs on Tier 3 (Non-preferred bra nd name) and Tier 4 (Inj ectable Drugs), you and your provider can ask the plan to make an excepti on in the cost-sharing ti er for the Part D drug so that you pay less for it. If your provider says that you have medical reasons that justify asking us for an exception, your provider can help you request an exception to the rule. If you and your provider want to ask for an ex ception see the \"Step-by-st ep: How to ask for a coverage decision, including an ex ception\" portion of the \"What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, co mplaints)\" section of this booklet, as it tells what to do. It explains the procedures and deadlines that have been set by Medicare to make sure your request is handled promptly and fairly. Drugs on some of our cost-sharing tiers are not eligible for this type of exception. We do not lower the cost-sharing amount for drugs on Tier 2 (Preferred brand drugs), Tier 5 (Specialty Tier), or non-Part D drugs on any of the tiers of the Drug List. What if your coverage chang es for one of your drugs? The Drug List can change during the year Most of the changes in drug coverage happen at the beginning of each year (January 1). However, during the year, the plan might make many kinds of changes to the Drug List. For example, the plan might: Add or remove drugs from the Drug List . New drugs become ava ilable, including new generic drugs. Perhaps the government has gi ven approval to a new use for an existing 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 130 drug. Sometimes, a drug gets recalled or we deci de not to cover it. Or we might remove a drug from the list because it has b een found to be ineffective. Move a drug to a higher or lower cost-sharing tier . Add or remove a restriction on coverage for a drug (for more information about restrictions to coverage, see the \"What if one of your drugs is not covered in the way you'd like it to be covered\" portion in this section). Replace a brand name drug with a generic drug . In almost all cases, we must get approval from Medicare for changes we make to the Part D drugs on the plan's Drug List. What happens if coverage changes for a Part D drug you are taking? How will you find out if your Part D drug's coverage has been changed? If there is a negative change to coverage for a Part D drug you are taking , the plan will send you a notice to tell you. Normally, we will let you know at le ast 60 days ahead of time . Once in a while, a drug is suddenly recalled because it's been found to be unsafe or for other reasons. If this happens, the plan will immediat ely remove the drug from the Drug List. We will let you know of this change right away. Your pr ovider will also know about this change, and can work with you to find another drug for your condition. Do changes to your Part D drug coverage affect you right away? If any of the following types of changes affect a Part D drug you are taking, the change will not affect you until January 1 of the next year if you stay in the plan: If we move your Part D drug in to a higher cost-sharing tier. If we put a new restriction on your use of the Part D drug. If we remove your Part D drug from the Drug List, but not because of a sudden recall or because a new generic drug has replaced it. If any of these changes happen for a Part D dr ug you are taking, then the change won't affect your use or what you pay as your share of the cost until January 1 of the next year. Until that date, you probably won't see any in crease in your payments or any added restriction to your use of the drug. However, on January 1 of th e next year, the changes will affect you. In some cases, you will be affected by th e coverage change before January 1: If a Part D brand name drug you are taking is replaced by a new generic drug , the plan must give you at least 60 days' notice or give you a 60-day refill of your Part D brand name drug at a network pharmacy. o During this 60-day period, you should be wo rking with your provider to switch to the generic or to a different Part D drug that we cover. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 131 o Or you and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception and continue to cover the Part D brand name drug for you. For information on how to ask for an exception, see the \"What to do if you ha ve a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints )\" section of this booklet. Again, if a drug is suddenly recalled because it's been found to be unsafe or for other reasons, the plan will immediately remove the drug from the Drug List. We will let you know of this change right away. o Your provider will also know about this change, and can work with you to find another drug for your condition. What types of drugs are not covered by the plan? Types of drugs we do not cover This portion of the section tells you what kinds of prescription drugs are \"excluded.\" If you get drugs that are exclude d, you must pay for them yourself. We won't pay for the drugs that are listed below. The only exception is if the requested Part D dr ug is found upon appeal to be a drug that is not excluded under Part D and we should have paid for or covered it because of your specific situation. (For inform ation about appealing a decision we have made to not cover a drug, go to the \"What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints\" section of this booklet.) Here are three general rules about dr ugs that our plan will not cover: Our plan's Part D drug coverage cannot cover a drug that would be covered under Medicare Part A or Part B. Our plan will not cover a drug purchased out side the United States and its territories. Our plan usually will not cover off-label use. \"Off-label use\" is any use of the drug other than those indicated on a dr ug's label as approved by the Food and Drug Administration. o Generally, coverage for \"off-label use\" is allowed only when the use is supported by certain reference books. These reference books are the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information, th e DRUGDEX Information System, and the USPDI or its successor. If the use is not supported by any of these reference books, then our plan cannot cover its \"off-label use.\" Also, the following categories of drugs are not covered or are rest ricted by our plan: Non-prescription drugs (also ca lled over-the-counter drugs) Drugs when used to promote fertility Drugs when used for cosmetic purposes or to promote hair growth 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 132 Prescription vitamins, mineral products, except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations Drugs when used for treatment of anor exia, weight loss, or weight gain Outpatient drugs for which the manufacturer se eks to require that associated tests or monitoring services be purcha sed exclusively from the manu facturer as a condition of sale Drugs when used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction may be subject to quantity limits. We offer additional coverage of some prescription drugs not normally covered in a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (enhanced drug coverage). Refer to the Drug List ( Formulary) to determine which drugs are covered under our en hanced drug coverage and for any applicable restrictions. The amount you pay when you fill a prescription for these drugs does not count towards qualifying you for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. (The Catastrophic Coverage Stage is described in the \"What you pay for your pr escription drugs\" section of this booklet.) In addition, if you are receiving \"Extra Help\" from Medicare to pay for your Part D prescriptions, the \"Extra Help\" program will not pay for the drugs not normally covered. (Please refer to the plan's Drug List or call Member Services for more information. Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cove r of this booklet.) However, if you have drug coverage through Medicaid, your state Medicaid program may cove r some prescription drugs not normally covered in a Medicare drug plan. Pl ease contact your stat e Medicaid program to determine what drug coverage may be avai lable to you. (You can find phone numbers and contact information for Medicaid in the \"Importa nt phone numbers and resources\" section of this booklet.) Show your plan membership card when you fill a prescription Show your membership card To fill your prescription, show your plan member ship card at the network pharmacy you choose. When you show your plan membership card, the network pharmacy will automatically bill the plan for our share of your covered prescription drug co st. You will need to pay the pharmacy your share of the cost when you pick up your prescription. What if you don't have your membership card with you? If you don't have your plan membership card w ith you when you fill your prescription, ask the pharmacy to call the plan to get the necessary information. If the pharmacy is not able to get the necessary information, you may have to pay the full cost of the prescription when you pick it up . (You can then ask us to reimburse you for our share. See, the \"How to ask us to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received\" portion of the \"Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs\" section of this booklet for information about how to ask the plan for reimbursement.) 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 133 Drug coverage in special situations What if you're in a hospital or a skilled nu rsing facility for a stay that is covered by the plan? If you are admitted to a hospital or to a skilled nursing facility for a stay covered by the plan, we will generally cover the cost of your prescription drugs durin g your stay. Once you leave the hospital or skilled nursing facility, the plan will cover your drugs as long as the drugs meet all of our rules for coverage. See the previous parts of this section that tell about the rules for getting drug coverage. The \"What you pay for your prescr iption drugs\" section of this booklet gives more information about drug coverage and what you pay. Please Note: When you enter, live in, or leave a skil led nursing facility, you are entitled to a Special Enrollment Period. During this time pe riod, you can switch plans or change your coverage. The \"Ending your membership in the pl an\" section of this booklet, tells when you can leave our plan and join a different Medicare plan. What if you're a resident in a long-term care (LTC) facility? Usually, a long-term care (LTC) facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy, or a pharmacy that supplies drugs for all of its reside nts. If you are a reside nt of a long-term care (LTC) facility, you may get your pr escription drugs through the facility's pharmacy as long as it is part of our network. Check your Pharmacy Directory to find out if your long-term car e (LTC) facility's pharmacy is part of our network. If it isn't, or if you need more informati on, please contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet. What if you're a resident in a long-te rm care (LTC) facility and become a new member of the plan? If you need a Part D drug that is not on our Drug List or is restricted in so me way, the plan will cover a temporary supply of your Part D drug du ring the first 90 days of your membership. The total supply will be for a maximum of a 102-day s upply, or less if your pres cription is written for fewer days. (Please note that the long-term car e (LTC) pharmacy may provide the Part D drug in smaller amounts at a time to prevent waste.) If you have been a member of the plan for more than 90 days and need a Part D drug that is not on our Drug List or if the plan has any restric tion on the drug's coverage, we will cover one 34- day supply, or less if your prescrip tion is written for fewer days. During the time when you are getting a temporary supply of a Part D drug, you should talk with your provider to decide what to do when your temporary supply r uns out. Perhaps there is a different Part D drug covered by the plan that might work just as well for you. Or you and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception for you and cover the Part D drug in the way you would like it to be covered. If you and your provi der want to ask for an exception, see the \"Step-2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 134 by-step: How to ask for a coverage decisi on, including an exception\" portion of the \"What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage deci sions, appeals, complain ts)\" section of this booklet as it tells what to do. Special note about \"creditable coverage \": Each year your employer or retiree group should send you a notice that tell s if your prescription drug coverage for the next plan year is \"creditab le\" and the choices you have for drug coverage. If the coverage from the group plan is \"creditable,\" it means that the plan has drug coverage that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare's st andard prescription drug coverage. Keep these notices about creditable coverage because you may need them later. If you enroll in a Medicare plan that includes Part D drug cove rage, you may need these notices to show that you have maintained creditable coverage. If you didn't get a notice about creditable coverage from your employer or retiree group plan, you ca n get a copy from your employer or retiree plan's benefits administrato r or the employer or union. What if you're in Me dicare-certified hospice? Drugs are never covered by both hos pice and our plan at the same time. If you ar e enrolled in Medicare hospice and requi re an anti-nausea, laxative, pain me dication or antianxiety drug that is not covered by your hospice because it is unre lated to your terminal illness and related conditions, our plan must receive notification from eith er the prescriber or your hospice provider that the drug is unrelated befo re our plan can cover the drug. To prevent delays in receiving any unrelated drugs that should be covered by our plan, you can ask your hospice provider or prescriber to make sure we ha ve the notification that the drug is unrelated before you ask a pharmacy to fill your prescription. In the event you either revoke your hospice electi on or are discharged from hospice our plan should cover all your drugs. To prevent any dela ys at a pharmacy when your Medicare hospice benefit ends, you should bring documentation to the pharmacy to verify your revocation or discharge. See the previous parts of this section that tell about th e rules for getting drug coverage under our plan's prescription drug coverage. For mo re information about drug coverage and what you pay, see the \"What you pay for your pres cription drugs\" secti on in this booklet. Programs on drug safety and managing medications Programs to help members use drugs safely We conduct drug use reviews for our members to he lp make sure that they are getting safe and appropriate care. These reviews are especially important for members who have more than one provider who prescribes their drugs. We do a review each time you fill a prescription. We also review our records on a regular basis. During these reviews, we look for potential problems such as: 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs 135 Possible medication errors. Drugs that may not be necessary because you are taking another drug to treat the same medical condition. Drugs that may not be safe or approp riate because of your age or gender. Certain combinations of drugs that coul d harm you if taken at the same time. Prescriptions written for drugs that have ingredients you are allergic to. Possible errors in the amount (dos age) of a drug you are taking. If we see a possible problem in your use of me dications, we will work with your provider to correct the problem. Medication Therapy Management (MTM) pr ogram to help members manage their medications We have a program that can help our members with special situations. For example, some members have several complex me dical conditions or they may n eed to take many drugs at the same time, or they could have very high drug costs. This program is voluntary and free to members. A team of pharmacists and doctors developed the program for us. This program can help make sure that our members are using the drugs that work best to treat their medical conditions and help us identify possible medication errors. Our program is called a Medication Therapy Ma nagement (MTM) program. Some members who take several medications for different medical conditions may qualify. A pharmacist or other health professional will give you a comprehensive review of all your medi cations. You can talk about how best to take your medications, your costs, or any problems you're having. You'll get a written summary of this discussion. The summary has a medication action plan that recommends what you can do to make the best use of your me dications, with space for you to take notes or write down any follow-up questions. You'll also ge t a personal medication list that will include all the medications you're taking and why you take them. It's a good idea to schedule your medication review before your yearly \"Wellness\" visit, so you can talk to your doctor about your action plan and me dication list. Bring your action plan and medication list with you to your visit or anytime you talk wi th your doctors, pharmacists, and other health care providers. Als o, take your medication list with you if you go to the hospital or emergency room. If we have a program that fits your needs, we will automatically enroll you in the program and send you information. If you decide not to particip ate, please notify us and we will withdraw you from the program. If you have any questions about these programs, please contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 136 WHAT YOU PAY FOR YOUR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Did you know there are programs to help people pay for their drugs? The \"Extra Help\" program helps peopl e with limited resources pay for their drugs. For more information, see the portion on Information about programs to help people pay for their pr escription drugs in the \"Important phone numbers and resources\" section. Are you currently getting help to pay for your drugs? If you are in a program that helps pay for your drugs, some information in this Evidence of Coverage about the costs for Part D prescription drugs may not apply to you. We send you a separate insert, called the \"Evidence of Coverage Rider for Pe ople Who Get Extra Help Paying for Prescription Drugs\" (also known as the \"Low Income Subsidy Rider\" or the \"LIS Rider\"), which tells you ab out your drug coverage. If you don't have this insert, please call Member Se rvices and ask for the \"LIS Rider.\" (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) Introduction Use this section together with other ma terials that explain your drug coverage This section focuses on what you pay for your pres cription drugs. To keep things simple, we use \"drug\" in this section to mean a prescripti on drug. As explained in the \"Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs\" section of this Evidence of Coverage , not all drugs are Part D drugs - some drugs are covered under Medicare Part A or Part B and other drugs are excluded from Medicare coverage by law. Some non-Pa rt D drugs may be covered by our plan. To understand the payment information we give you in this section, you need to know the basics of what drugs are covered, where to fill your prescriptions, and what rules to follow when you get your covered drugs. Here are mate rials that explain these basics: The plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary). To keep things simple, we call this the \"Drug List.\" o This Drug List tells which drugs are covered for you. o It also tells which of the different \"cost- sharing tiers\" the drug is in and whether there are any restrictions on your coverage for the drug. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 137 o If you need a copy of the Drug List, ca ll Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). You can also find the Drug List on our website at www.healthnet.com/uc. The Drug Li st on the website is always the most current. The \"Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs\" section of this Evidence of Coverage. This section gives the details a bout your prescription drug coverage, including rules you need to follow when you get your covered drugs. This section also tells which types of prescription drugs are not covered by our plan. The plan's Pharmacy Directory. In most situations you must use a network pharmacy to get your covered drugs (see the \"Using the plan 's coverage for your prescription drugs\" section of this Evidence of Coverage for the details). The Pharmacy Directory has a list of pharmacies in the plan's network . It also tells you which pharmacies in our network can give you a long-term supply of a drug (such as filling a prescription for a three-month's supply). Types of out-of-pocket costs y ou may pay for covered drugs To understand the payment information we give you in this section, you need to know about the types of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services. The amount that you pay for a drug is called \"cost-sharing,\" and there are three ways you may be asked to pay. The \"deductible\" (if applicable to y our plan) is the amount you must pay for drugs before our plan begins to pay its share. \"Copayment\" means that you pay a fixed amount each time you fill a prescription. \"Coinsurance\" means that you pay a percent of the total cost of the drug each time you fill a prescription. What you pay for a Part D drug depends on which \"drug payment stage\" you are in when you get the Part D drug What are the drug payment stages for our members? There are different \"drug payment stages\" for your Part D prescrip tion drug coverage under our plan. How much you pay for a Part D drug depends on which of these stages you are in at the time you get a prescription filled or refille d. Keep in mind you are always responsible for the plan's monthly premium (if applicable ) regardless of the drug payment stage. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 138 Stage 1 Yearly Deductible Stage Stage 2 Initial Coverage Stage Stage 3 Coverage Gap StageStage 4 Catastrophic Coverage Stage Because there is no deductible for the plan, this payment stage does not apply to you. You begin in this payment stage. During this stage, the plan pays its share of the cost of your drugs and you pay your share of the cost. You stay in this stage until your total Part D drug costs reach the limit for the Initial Coverage Stage. During the Coverage Gap Stage, you will pay no more than your copayment or coinsurance for your covered drugs as stated in the Initial Coverage Stage. You stay in this stage until your total Part D \"out-of-pocket costs\" (your payments) reach the limit for the Coverage Gap stage.Most people do not reach the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. If you do reach this stage, we will pay most of the cost of your Part D drugs for the rest of the plan year. Please note: After your out-of-pocket costs (your payments) reach $2,000, you pay no copayments or coinsurance for all covered drugs (excluding Part B drugs and products) for the remainder of the year. Please see the \"Out-of-pocket maximum for outpatient prescription drugs\" portion of this section for more information. We send you reports that explain pa yments for your Part D drugs and which payment stage you are in We send you a monthly report called the \"Part D Explanation of Benefits\" (the \"PART D EOB\") Our plan keeps track of the costs of your Part D prescription drugs and the payments you have made when you get your Part D prescriptions filled or refilled at the pharmacy. This way, we can tell you when you have moved from one drug paymen t stage to the next. In particular, there are two types of costs we keep track of: 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 139 We keep track of how much you have paid. This is called your \" out-of-pocket \" cost. We keep track of your Part D \" total drug costs .\" This is the amount you pay out-of- pocket or others pay on your behalf pl us the amount paid by the plan. Our plan will prepare a written report called the Part D Explanation of Benefits (it is sometimes called the \"PART D EOB\") when you have had one or more Part D prescriptions filled through the plan during the previ ous month. It includes: Information for that month . This report gives the payment details about the Part D prescriptions you have filled during the previous month. It shows the total Part D drug costs, what the plan paid, and what you and others on your behalf paid. Totals for the year. This is called \"year-to-date\" inform ation. It shows you the total Part D drug costs and total Part D payments for your drugs since the year began. Help us keep our information about your Part D drug payments up to date To keep track of your Part D drug costs and th e payments you make for Part D drugs, we use records we get from pharmacies. Here is how you can help us keep your information correct and up to date: Show your membership card when you get a prescription filled. To make sure we know about the prescriptions you are filling and what you are paying, show your plan membership card every time you get a prescription filled. Make sure we have the information we need. There are times you may pay for Part D prescription drugs when we will not automatica lly get the information we need to keep track of your Part D out-of-pocket costs. To help us keep track of your Part D out-of- pocket costs, you may give us copies of receipts for Part D drugs that you have purchased. (If you are billed for a covered drug, you can ask our plan to pay our share of the cost. For instructions on how to do this, go to the \"How to ask us to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received\" portion of th e \"Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical se rvices or drugs\" section of this Evidence of Coverage .) Here are some types of situations wh en you may want to give us copies of your Part D drug receipts to be sure we have a complete record of what you have spent for your Part D drugs: o When you purchase a covered Part D dr ug at a network pharmacy at a special price or using a discount card that is not part of our plan's benefit. o When you pay a copayment for Part D drugs that are provided under a drug manufacturer patient assistance program. o Any time you have purchased covered Part D drugs at out-of-network pharmacies or other times you have paid the full pr ice for a covered Part D drug under special circumstances. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 140 Send us information about the payments for Part D drugs others have made for you. Payments made by certain other individuals a nd organizations for Part D drugs also count toward your out-of-pocket costs and help qualify you for catastrophic coverage. For example, payments made by an AIDS drug assistance program, the Indian Health Service, and most charities count toward your out-of-pocket costs. You should keep a record of these payments and send them to us so we can track your costs. Check the written report we send you. When you receive your Part B Explanation of Benefits (PART D EOB) in the mail, please look it over to be sure the information is complete and correct. If you think a Part D drug is missing from the report, or you have any questions, please call us at Member Serv ices (phone numbers ar e printed on the back cover of this booklet). Be sure to keep these reports. They are an important record of your drug expenses. There is no deductible for our plan You do not pay a deductible for your Part D drugs There is no deductible for our plan. You begin in the Initial Coverage Stage when you fill your first prescription of the year. See the \"During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays its share of your drug costs and you pay your share\" porti on of this section for information about your coverage in the Initial Coverage Stage. During the Initial Coverag e Stage, the plan pays its share of your drug costs and you pay your share What you pay for a drug depends on the drug and where you fill your prescription During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays its share of the cost of your covered prescription drugs, and you pay your share (your copayment or coinsurance amount). Your share of the cost will vary depending on the drug and where you fill your prescription. The plan's cost-sharing tiers Every drug on the plan's Drug List is on one of th e cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher the cost-sharing tier, the higher your cost for the drug: Tier 1 is the lowest tier and incl udes preferred generic drugs. Tier 2 includes preferred brand drugs. Drugs on this tier are not eligible for exceptions for payment at a lower tier. Tier 3 includes non-preferred brand drugs. Tier 4 (Injectable Drugs) includes injectable drugs that do not meet the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) minimum cost threshold required to be placed on the Specialty Tier (Tier 5). 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 141 Tier 5 (Specialty Drugs) includes high cost dr ugs. Specialty Drugs are not eligible for exceptions for payment at a lower tier. To find out which cost-sharing tier your drug is on, look it up on the plan's Drug List . Your pharmacy choices How much you pay for a drug depe nds on where you get the drug: A retail pharmacy that is in our plan's network A pharmacy that is not in the plan's network The plan's mail-order pharmacy UC Walk-Up Service For more information about these pharmacy c hoices and filling your prescriptions, see the \"Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs\" section in this booklet and the plan's Pharmacy Directory. A table that shows your costs for a one-month (30-day) supply of a drug During the Initial Coverage Stage, your share of the cost of a covered drug will be either a copayment or coinsurance. \"Copayment\" means that you pay a fixed amount each time you fill a prescription. \"Coinsurance\" means that you pay a percent of the total cost of the drug each time you fill a prescription. As shown in the table below, the amount of the copayment or coinsurance depends on which cost-sharing tier your drug is on. Please note: If your covered drug costs less than the c opayment amount listed in the chart, you will pay that lower price for the drug. You pay either the full price of the drug or the copayment amount, whichever is lower. We cover prescriptions filled at out-of-network pharmacies in only limited situations. Please see the \"When can you use a pharmacy that is not in the plan's network?\" portion of the \"Using the plan's coverage for your pr escription drugs\" section of this booklet for information about when we will cover a prescription filled at an out-of-network pharmacy. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 142 Your share of the cost when you get a one-month (30-day) supply of a covered prescription drug from: Standard retail cost-sharing (in-network) (up to a 30-day supply) Mail order cost-sharing (up to a 30- day supply) Long-term care (LTC) cost-sharing (up to a 34-day supply) Out-of-network cost-sharing (Coverage is limited to certain situations) (up to a 30-day supply) Tier 1 (Preferred generic drugs.) $5 $5 $5 $5 Tier 2 (Preferred brand drugs. Drugs on this tier are not eligible for exceptions for payment at a lower tier) $25 $25 $25 Tier 4 Injectable Drugs (Includes injectable drugs that do not meet the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) minimum cost threshold required to be placed on Tier 5 (Specialty Drugs).) 25% 25% 25% 25% 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 143 Standard retail cost-sharing (in-network) (up to a 30-day supply) Mail order cost-sharing (up to a 30- day supply) Long-term care (LTC) cost-sharing (up to a 34-day supply) Out-of-network cost-sharing (Coverage is limited to certain situations)(up to a 30-day supply) Tier 5 Specialty Drugs (High cost drugs. Specialty drugs are not eligible for exceptions for payment at a lower tier.) 25% used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction are limited to four doses per month. Drugs when used for the treatment of se xual or erectile dysfunction are limited to eight doses per month for Members who received eigh t doses per month prio r to being Medicare- eligible and enrolling in this plan. If your doctor prescribes less than a full month's supply, you may not have to pay the cost of the entire month's supply Typically, you pay a copay to cover a full m onth's supply of a covered drug. However your doctor can prescribe less than a month's supply of drugs. There may be times when you want to ask your doctor about prescribing less than a month's supply of a drug (for example, when you are trying a medication for the first time that is known to have serious side effects). If your doctor agrees, you will not have to pay for the full month's supply for certain drugs. The amount you pay when you get less than a full month's supply will depend on whether you are responsible for paying coinsurance (a percenta ge of the total cost) or a copayment (a flat dollar amount). If you are responsible fo r coinsurance, you pay a percentage of the total cost of the drug. You pay the same percentage regardless of whether the prescription is for a full month's supply or for fewer days. However, because th e entire drug cost will be lower if you get less than a full month's supply, the amount you pay will be less. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 144 If you are responsible for a copayment for the drug, your copay will be based on the number of days of the drug that you recei ve. We will calculate the amount you pay per day for your drug (the \"daily cost-sharing rate \") and multiply it by the number of days of the drug you receive. o Here's an example: Let's say the copay for your drug for a full month's supply (a 30-day supply) is $30. This means that th e amount you pay per day for your drug is $1. If you receive a 7-day supply of the drug, your payment will be $1 per day multiplied by 7 days, for a total payment of $7. o You should not have to pay more per day just because you begin with less than a month's supply. Let's go back to th e example above. Let's say you and your doctor agree that the drug is working we ll and that you should continue taking the drug after your 7-day supply r uns out. If you receive a se cond prescription for the rest of the month, or 23 days more of the drug, you will still pay $1 per day, or $23. Your total cost for the month will be $7 for your first prescription and $23 for your second prescription, for a total of $30 - the same as your copay would be for a full month's supply. Daily cost-sharing allows you to make sure a drug works for you before you have to pay for an entire month's supply. A table that shows your costs for a long-term (90-day) supply of a drug For some drugs, you can get a long-term supply (also called an \"extended supply\") when you fill your prescription. A long-term supply is up to a 90- day supply. (For details on where and how to get a long-term supply of a drug, see the \"Using th e plan's coverage for your prescription drugs\" section in this booklet.) The table below shows what you pay when you get a long-term (90-day supply) of a drug. Please note: If your covered drug costs less than the copayment amount listed in the chart, you will pay that lower price for the drug. You pay either the full price of the drug or the copayment amount, whichever is lower . Your share of the cost when you get a long-term supply of a covered prescription drug from: 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 145 Standard retail cost-sharing (in network) (up to a 90-day supply) UC Walk-Up service through UC Medical Center Pharmacies (a 90-day supply) Mail-order cost- sharing (up to a 90-day supply) Tier 1 (Preferred generic drugs.) $15 $10 $10 Tier 2 (Preferred brand drugs.

Your total Part D drug cost is based on adding to gether what you have paid and what any Part D plan has paid: What you have paid for all the covered Part D drugs you have gotten since you started with your first drug purchase of the year. (S ee the \"How Medicare calculates your out- of-pocket costs for Part D pr escription drugs\" portion of th is section for information about how Medicare counts your out-of -pocket costs.) This includes: o The Deductible (if applicable) you paid for Part D Drugs when you were in the Deductible Stage. o The total you paid as your share of th e cost for your Part D drugs during the Initial Coverage Stage. What the plan has paid as its share of the cost for Part D drugs during the Initial Coverage Stage. (If you were enrolled in a different Part D plan at any time during 2015, the amount that plan paid during the Initial Coverage Stage also counts toward your total drug costs.) We offer additional coverage on some prescription drugs that are not normally covered in a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan. Payments made for these drugs will not count towards your initial coverage limit. To find out which drugs our plan covers, refer to your formulary. The Part D Explanation of Benefits (PART D EOB) that we send to you will help you keep track of how much you and the plan have spent for yo ur Part D drugs during the year. Many people do not reach the : $2,960 limit in a year. We will let you know if you reach this $2,960 amount. If you do reach this amount, you will leave the Initial Coverage Stage and move on to the Coverage Gap Stage. During the Coverage Gap Stage, you receive a discount on Part D brand name drugs You stay in the Coverage Gap Stage until your out-of-pocket costs reach $4,700 In addition to the Medicare coverage gap di scounts described below, your Employer Group or Benefits Administrator also provi des additional coverage. This mean s that with this discount and the additional coverage, you will pay no more th an your copayment or coinsurance for your covered Part D drugs as stated in the Initial Coverage Stage. For all other covered Non Part D Drugs during the Coverage Gap Stage you continue to pay your copayment or coinsurance as stated in the Initial Coverage Stage. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 147 The Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program provides a manufacturer discount on Part D brand name drugs to Part D enrollees who have reached the coverage gap and are not already receiving \"Extra Help.\" A 50% discount on the negotiated price (excl uding the dispensing fee and vaccine administration fee, if any) is avai lable for those Part D brand name drugs from manufacturers that have agr eed to pay the discount. If you reach the coverage gap, we will automatically apply the discount when your pharmacy bills you for your prescription and your Part D Explanation of Benefits (PART D EOB) will show any discount provided. Both the amount you pay and the amount discounted by the manufacturer count toward your out-of-pocket costs as if you had paid them and move you through the coverage gap. If you have any questions about the availability of discounts for the drugs you are taking or about the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program in general, please contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). Please note: After your out-of-pocket cost s (your payments) reach $2,000, you pay no copayments or coinsurance for all covered drugs (excluding Part B drugs and products) for the remainder of the year. Please see the \"Out-of- pocket maximum for outpatient prescription drugs\" portion of this section for more information. How Medicare calculates your out-of-pocket costs for Part D prescription drugs Medicare has rules about what counts and what does not count as your out-of-pocket costs. When you reach an out-of-pocket limit of $4,700, you leave the Coverage Gap Stage and move on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. Here are Medicare's rules that we must follow when we keep track of your out-of-pocket costs for your Part D drugs. These payments are included in your out-of-pocket costs When you add up your out-of-pocket costs, you can include the payments listed below (as long as they are for Part D covered drugs and you followed the rules for drug coverage that are explained in the \" Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs\" section of this booklet): The amount you pay for drugs when you ar e in any of the following drug payment stages: o The Deductible Stage (if applicable). o The Initial Coverage Stage. o The Coverage Gap Stage. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 148 Any payments you made during this calendar year as a member of a different Medicare prescription drug plan before you joined our plan. It matters who pays: If you make these payments yourself , they are included in your out-of-pocket costs. These payments are also included if they are made on your behalf by certain other individuals or organizations. This includes payments for your drugs made by a friend or relative, by most charities, by AIDS drug assistance programs, or by the Indian Health Service. Payments made by Medicare's \"Extra Help\" Program are also included. Some of the payments made by the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program are included. The amount the manufacturer pays for your brand name drugs is included. But the amount the plan pays for your generic drugs is not included. Moving on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage: When you (or those paying on your behalf) have spent a total of $4,700 in out-of-pocket costs for Part D drugs within the year, you will move from the Coverage Gap Stage to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. These payments are not included in your out-of-pocket costs When you add up your out-of-pocket costs, you are not allowed to include any of these types of payments for prescription drugs: The amount you pay for your m onthly premium (if applicable). Drugs you buy outside the United States and its territories. Drugs that are not covered by our plan. Drugs you get at an out-of-network pharmacy that do not meet the plan's requirements for out-of-network coverage. Prescription drugs covered by Part A or Part B. Payments you make toward drugs covered under our additional coverage but not normally covered in a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan. Payments you make toward prescription drugs not normally covered in a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan. Payments made by the plan for your brand or generic drugs while in the Coverage Gap. Payments for your drugs that are made by group health plans, including employer health plans. Payments for your drugs that are made by certain insurance plans and government- funded health programs such as TRICARE and the Veteran's Administration. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 149 Payments for your drugs made by a third-party with a legal obligation to pay for prescription costs (for example, Worker's Compensation). Reminder: If any other organization such as the ones listed above pays part or all of your out-of-pocket costs for Part D drugs, you are required to tell our plan. Call Member Services to let us know (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). How can you keep track of your out-of-pocket total? We will help you . The Part D Explanation of Benefits (PART D EOB) report we send to you includes the current amount of your out-of-pocket costs (The \"We send you reports that explain payments for your Part D drugs and which payment stage you are in\" portion of this section tells about this report). When you reach a total of $4,700 in Part D out-of-pocket costs for the year, this report will tell you that you have left the Coverage Gap Stage and have moved on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. Make sure we have the information we need. The \"Help us keep our information about your Part D drug payments up to date\" portion of this sec tion tells what you can do to help make sure that our records of what you have spent are complete and up to date. Out-of-Pocket maximum for outpatient prescription drugs There is a yearly out-of-poc ket maximum of $2,000 for covere d outpatient prescription drugs. Once your out-of-pocket costs for covered outpatien t prescription drugs (e xcluding Part B drugs and products) reach $2,000 in the calendar year, you will not pay any more copayment/coinsurance for covered outpatient pr escription drugs for the rest of the year. All expenses that apply to the $2,000 out-of-pocket maximum will automatically be calculated by Health Net. During the Catastrophic Coverage Stag e, the plan pays most of the cost for your Part D drugs Once you are in the Catastrophic Coverage St age, you will stay in this stage for the rest of the year You qualify for the Catastrophic Coverage Stag e when your Part D out-of-pocket costs have reached the $4,700 limit for the plan year. Once you are in the Catastrophic Coverage Stage, you will stay in this payment stage until the end of the plan year. During this stage, the plan will pay most of the cost for your Part D drugs. Your share of the cost for a covered Part D drug will be either coinsurance or a copayment, whichever is the larger amount (not to exceed the applicable plan tier copayment as stated in the Initial Coverage State): 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 150 o -either - coinsurance of 5% of the cost of the drug o -or - $2.65 copayment for a generic drug or a drug that is treated like a generic. Or a $6.60 copayment for all other drugs. Our plan pays the rest of the cost. For all other covered non-Part D drugs you pay the applicable copayment or coinsurance as stated in the Initial Coverage Stage Please note: After your out-of-pocket cost s (your payments) reach $2,000, you pay no copayments or coinsurance for all covered drugs (excluding Part B drugs and products) for the remainder of the year. Please see the \"Out-of- pocket maximum for outpatient prescription drugs\" portion of this section for more information. What you pay for vaccinations cove red by Part D depends on how and where you get them Our plan has separate coverage for the Part D vaccine medicat ion itself and for the cost of giving you the vaccination shot Our plan provides coverage of a number of Part D vaccines. We also cover vaccines that are considered medical benefits. You can find out ab out coverage of these vaccines by going to the \"Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section ear lier in this booklet. There are two parts to our coverage of Part D vaccinations: The first part of coverage is the cost of the Part D vaccine medication itself . The vaccine is a prescription medication. The second part of coverage is for the cost of giving you the Part D vaccination shot . (This is sometimes called the \"administration\" of the vaccine.) What do you pay for a vaccination? What you pay for a vaccination depends on three things: 1. The type of vaccine (what you are being vaccinated for). o Some vaccines are considered medical benefits. You can find out about your coverage of these vaccines by going to th e \"Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section of this booklet. o Other vaccines are considered Part D dr ugs. You can find these vaccines listed in the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary). 2. Where you get the vaccine medication. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 151 3. Who gives you the vaccination. What you pay at the time you get the Part D vaccination can vary depending on the circumstances. For example: Sometimes when you get your Part D vaccinatio n, you will have to pay the entire cost for both the Part D vaccine medication and for th e administration of the Part D vaccination. You can ask our plan to pay you ba ck for our share of the cost. Other times, when you get the Part D vacci ne medication or get a Part D vaccination administered, you will pay only your share of the cost. To show how this works, here are three common ways you might get a Part D vaccination. Remember you are responsible for all of the cost s associated with vacc ines (including their administration) during the Deductible Stag e of your benefit (if applicable). Situation 1: You buy the Part D vaccine at the ph armacy and you get your vaccination shot at the network pharmacy. (Whether you have this choice depends on where you live. Some states do not allow pharm acies to administer a vaccination.) You will have to pay the pharmacy the amount of your copayment or coinsurance for the Part D vaccine and the cost of giving you the vaccination shot. Our plan will pay the remainder of the cost. Situation 2: You get the Part D vaccinati on at your doctor's office. When you get the Part D vaccination, you will pay for the entire cost of the Part D vaccine and its administration. You can then ask our plan to pay our share of the cost by using the procedures that are described in th e \"Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs\" section of this booklet. You will be reimbursed the amount you paid less your normal copayment or coinsurance for the Part D vaccine (including administration) less any differen ce between the amount the doctor charges and what we normally pay. (If you get \"Extra Help\", we will reimburse you for this difference.) Situation 3: You buy the Part D vaccine at your pharmacy, and then take it to your doctor's office where they give you the Part D vaccination. You will have to pay the pharmacy the amount of your copayment or coinsurance for the Part D vaccine itself. When your doctor gives you the Part D vaccination, you will pay the entire cost for this service. You can then ask our plan to pay our share of the cost by using the procedures described in the \"Asking us to pay 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 152 our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs\" section of this booklet. You will be reimbursed the amount charged by the doctor for administering the Part D vaccine less any difference between the amount the doctor charges and what we normally pay. (If you get \"Extra Help\", we will reimburse you for this difference.) You may want to call us at Member Services before you get a vaccination The rules for coverage of vaccinations are complicated. We are here to help. We recommend that you call us first at Member Services whenever you are planning to get a vaccination. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printe d on the back cover of this booklet.) We can tell you about how your vaccination is covered by our plan and explain your share of the cost. We can tell you how to keep your own cost down by using providers and pharmacies in our network. If you are not able to use a network provider or pharmacy, we can tell you what you need to do to get payment from us for our share of the cost. Do you have to pay the Part D \"late enrollment penalty\"? What is the Part D \"lat e enrollment penalty\"? Note: If you receive \"Extra Help\" from Medicare to pay for your prescription drugs, you will not pay a late enrollment penalty. The late enrollment penalty is an amount that is added to your Part D premium. You may owe a late enrollment penalty if at a ny time after your initial enrollment period is over, there is a period of 63 days or more in a row when you did not ha ve Part D or other cred itable prescription drug coverage. Creditable prescription drug coverage\" is coverage th at meets Medicare's minimum standards since it is expected to pay, on averag e, at least as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug coverage. The amount of the penalty depends on how long you waited to enroll in a creditable prescrip tion drug coverage plan any time afte r the end of your initial enrollment period or how many full calendar months you we nt without creditabl e prescription drug coverage. You will have to pay this penalty for as long as you have Part D coverage. The penalty is added to your monthl y premium. When you first enroll in our plan , we let you know the amount of the penalty. Your late enrollment penalty is c onsidered part of your plan prem ium. If you do not pay your late enrollment penalty, you could lose your prescription drug benefits for failure to pay your plan 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 153 premium. Please contact your empl oyer/union benefits administrator for more information about the premium payment for this plan. How much is the Part D late enrollment penalty? Medicare determines the amount of the penalty. Here is how it works: First count the number of full months that you delayed enrolling in a Medicare drug plan, after you were eligible to enroll. Or count the number of full months in which you did not have creditable prescription drug coverage, if the break in cove rage was 63 days or more. The penalty is 1% for every month that you didn't have creditabl e coverage. For our example, if you go 14 months without coverage, the penalty will be 14%. Then Medicare determines the amount of the average monthly premium for Medicare drug plans in the nation from the previous year. For 2015, this average premium amount is $33.13. To calculate your monthly penalty, you multiply the penalty percentage and the average monthly premium and then round it to the near est 10 cents. In the example here it would be 14% times $33.13, which equals $4.64 whic h rounds to $4.60. This amount would be added to the monthly premium for someon e with a late enrollment penalty . There are three important things to note a bout this monthly late enrollment penalty: First, the penalty may change each year , because the average monthly premium can change each year. If the national averag e premium (as determined by Medicare) increases, your penalty will increase. Second, you will continue to pay a penalty every month for as long as you are enrolled in a plan that has Medica re Part D drug benefits. Third, if you are under 65 and currently receivi ng Medicare benefits, the late enrollment penalty will reset when you tu rn 65. After age 65, your late enrollment penalty will be based only on the months that you don't ha ve coverage after your initial enrollment period for Medicare. In some situations, you can enroll late and not have to pay the penalty Even if you have delayed enrolling in a plan o ffering Medicare Part D coverage when you were first eligible, sometimes you do not have to pay the late enrollment penalty. You will not have to pay a penalty for late enro llment if you are in any of these situations: 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 154 If you already have prescripti on drug coverage that is exp ected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare's standard prescr iption drug coverage. Medicare calls this \"creditable drug coverage .\" Please note: o Creditable coverage could include drug coverage from a former employer or union, TRICARE, or the Department of Ve terans Affairs. Your insurer or your human resources department will tell you each year if your drug coverage is creditable coverage. This information may be sent to you in a letter or included in a newsletter from the plan. Keep this information, because you may need it if you join a Medicare drug plan later . Please note: If you receive a \"certific ate of creditable coverage\" when your health coverage ends, it may not mean the prescription drug coverage was creditable coverage. The notice must state that you had \"creditable\" prescription drug coverage that expect ed to pay as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug plan pays. o The following are not creditable prescription drug coverage: prescription drug discount cards, free clinics, and drug discount websites. o For additional information about cr editable coverage, please look in your Medicare & You 2015 handbook or call Medicare at 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800- 633-4227). TTY users call 1-877-486-2048. You can call these numbers for free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you were without creditable coverage, but you were without it for less than 63 days in a row. If you are receiving \"Extra Help\" from Medicare. What can you do if you disagree about your late enrollment penalty? If you disagree about your late enro llment penalty, you or your re presentative can ask for a review of the decision about your late enroll ment penalty. Generally, you must request this review within 60 days from the date on the letter you rece ive stating you have to pay a late enrollment penalty. Call Member Services to fi nd out more about how to do this (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). Important: Do not stop paying your late enrollment penalty while you' re waiting for a review of the decision about your late enro llment penalty. If you do, you could be disenrolled for failure to pay your plan premiums. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 155 Do you have to pay an extra Part D amount because of your income? Who pays an extra Part D amount because of income? Most people pay a standard monthly Part D pr emium. However, some people pay an extra amount because of their yearly income. If your income is greater than $85,000 for an individual (or married individuals filing se parately) or greater than $170, 000 for married couples, you must pay an extra amount directly to the govern ment for your Medicare Part D coverage. If you have to pay an extra amount, Social Se curity, not your Medicare plan, will send you a letter telling you what that extra amount will be and how to pay it. The extra amount will be withheld from your Social Security, Railroa d Retirement Board, or Office of Personnel Management benefit check, no matter how you us ually pay your plan premium, unless your monthly benefit isn't enough to cover the extr a amount owed. If your be nefit check isn't enough to cover the extra amount, you will get a bill from Medicare. You must pay the extra amount to the government. It cannot be paid with your monthly plan premium. How much is the extra Part D amount? If your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) as reported on your IRS ta x return is above a certain amount, you will pay an extra amount in addition to your monthly plan premium. The chart below shows the extra amount based on your income. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What you pay for your prescription drugs 156 If you filed an individual tax return and your income in 2013 was: If you were married but filed a separate tax return and your income in 2013 was: If you filed a joint tax return and your income in 2013 was: This is the monthly cost of your extra Part D amount (to be paid in addition to your plan premium) Equal to or less than $85,000 Equal to or less than $85,000 Equal to or less than $170,000 $0 Greater than $85,000 and less than or equal to $107,000 Greater than $170,000 and less than or equal to $214,000 $12.30 Greater than $107,000 and less than or equal to $160,000 Greater than $214,000 and less than or equal to $320,000 $31.80 Greater than $160,000 and less than or equal to $214,000 Greater than $85,000 and less than or equal to $129,000 Greater than $320,000 and less than or equal to $428,000 $51.30 Greater than $214,000 Greater than $129,000 Greater than $428,000 $70.80 What can you do if you disagree a bout paying an extra Part D amount? If you disagree about paying an extra amount becau se of your income, you can ask Social Security to review the decision. To find out more about how to do this, contact Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY: 1-800-325-0778). What happens if you do not pay the extra Part D amount? The extra amount is paid directly to the governme nt (not your Medicare plan) for your Medicare Part D coverage. If you are required to pay th e extra amount and you do not pay it, you will be disenrolled from the plan and lo se prescription drug coverage. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have re ceived for covered medical services or drugs 157 ASKING US TO PAY OUR SHARE OF A BILL YOU HAVE RECEIVED FOR COVERED MEDICAL SERVICES OR DRUGS Situations in which you should ask us to pay our share of the cost of your covered services or drugs If you pay our plan's share of the cost of your cover ed services or drugs, or if you receive a bill, you can ask us for payment Sometimes when you get medical care or a prescr iption drug, you may need to pay the full cost right away. Other times, you ma y find that you have paid more than you expected under the coverage rules of the plan. In either case, you can ask our plan to pay you back (paying you back is often called \"reimbursing\" you). It is your right to be paid back by our plan whenever you've paid more than your share of the cost for medical services or drugs that are covered by our plan. There may also be times when you get a bill from a provider for the full cost of medical care you have received. In many cases, you should send this bill to us instea d of paying it. We will look at the bill and decide whether the services should be covered. If we decide they should be covered, we will pay the provider directly. Here are examples of situations in which you may need to ask our plan to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received. 1. When you've received emergency or urgently needed medical care from a provider who is not in our plan's network You can receive emergency services from any pr ovider, whether or not the provider is a part of our network. When you receive emergency or urgently needed care from a provider who is not part of our network, you are only responsible for paying your sh are of the cost, not for the entire cost. You should ask the provider to bill the plan for our share of the cost. If you pay the entire amount yourself at the time you receive the ca re, you need to ask us to pay you back for our share of the co st. Send us the bill, along with documentation of any payments you have made. At times you may get a bill from the provi der asking for payment that you think you do not owe. Send us this bill, along with docum entation of any payments you have already made. o If the provider is owed anything, we will pay the provider directly. o If you have already paid more than your sh are of the cost of the service, we will determine how much you owed and pay you back for our share of the cost. 2. When a network provider sends y ou a bill you think you should not pay Network providers should always bill the pl an directly, and ask you only for your share of the cost. But sometimes they make mistakes, and ask you to pay more than your share. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have re ceived for covered medical services or drugs 158 You only have to pay your cost-sharing am ount when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow providers to add addi tional separate charges, called \"balance billing.\" This protection (that you never pay more than your cost-sharing amount) applies even if we pay the pr ovider less than the provider ch arges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don't pay certain provider charges. For more information about \"balance billing,\" go to the \"Our plan does not allow providers to 'balance bill' you\" portion of the \"Medical Benefits Ch art (what is covered and what you pay)\" section in this booklet. Whenever you get a bill from a network pr ovider that you think is more than you should pay, send us the bill. We will cont act the provider directly and resolve the billing problem. If you have already paid a bill to a networ k provider, but you feel that you paid too much, send us the bill along with documentation of any payment you have made and ask us to pay you back the difference betw een the amount you paid and the amount you owed under the plan. 3. If you are retroactively enrolled in our plan. Sometimes a person's enrollment in the plan is retroactive. (Retroactive means that the first day of their enrollment has already passed. The enrollment date may even have occurred last year.) If you were retroactively enrolled in our pl an and you paid out-of-pocket for any of your covered services or drugs after your enrollmen t date, you can ask us to pay you back for our share of the costs. You will n eed to submit paperwork for us to handle the reimbursement. Please call Member Services for additional information about how to ask us to pay you back and deadlines for making your request. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) 4. When you use an out-of-network pharmacy to get a prescription filled If you go to an out-of-network pharmacy and tr y to use your membership card to fill a prescription, the pharmacy may not be able to submit the claim directly to us. When that happens, you will have to pay the full cost of your prescription. (We cover prescriptions filled at out-of-network pharmacies only in a few special situations. Please go to the \"When can you use a pharmacy that is not in the plan 's network\" portion of the \"Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs\" sect ion of this booklet to learn more.) Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost. You can mail your payment request to the address listed below. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have re ceived for covered medical services or drugs 159 5. When you pay the full cost fo r a prescription because you don't have your plan membership card with you If you do not have your plan membership card with you, you can ask th e pharmacy to call the plan or to look up your plan enrollment info rmation. However, if the pharmacy cannot get the enrollment information they need right away, you may need to pay the full cost of the prescription yourself. Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost. You can mail your payment request to the address listed below. 6. When you pay the full cost for a prescription in other situations You may pay the full cost of the prescription because you find that the drug is not covered for some reason. For example, the drug may not be on the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) ; or it could have a requirement or restriction that you didn't know a bout or don't think should apply to you. If you decide to get th e drug immediately, you may need to pay the full cost for it. Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back. In some situations, we may need to get more inform ation from your doctor in order to pay you back for our share of the cost. You can mail your payment request to the address listed below. All of the examples above are types of covera ge decisions. This means that if we deny your request for payment, you can a ppeal our decision. The \"What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complain ts)\" section of this booklet has information about how to make an appeal. How to ask us to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received How and where to send us your request for payment Send us your request for payment, along with your bill and documentation of any payment you have made. It's a good idea to make a copy of your bill and receipts for your records. To make sure you are giving us all the informa tion we need to make a decision, you can fill out our claim form to make your request for payment. You don't have to use the form, but it will help us process the information faster. Either download a copy of the form from our website (www.healthnet.com/uc) or call Member Services and ask for the form.

You can also call if you want to give us more information about a request for pa yment you have already sent to us. We will consider your request for payment and say yes or no We check to see whether we should cover the service or drug and how much we owe When we receive your request for payment, we will let you know if we need any additional information from you. Otherwise, we will consider your request and decide whether to pay it and make a coverage decision. If we decide that the medical care or drug is covered and you followed all the rules for getting the care or drug, we will pay for our sh are of the cost. If you have already paid for the service or drug, we will mail your reimbursement of our share of the cost to you. If you have not paid for the service or drug yet, we will mail the payment directly to the provider. (The \"Using the plan 's coverage for your medical services\" section of this booklet explains the rules you need to follow for getting your medical services covered. The \"Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs\" section of this booklet explains the rules you need to follow for getting your prescription drugs covered.) If we decide that the medical care or drug is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, we will not reimburse you. Instead, we will send you a letter that explains the reasons why we are not sending the payment you have requested and your rights to appeal that decision. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have re ceived for covered medical services or drugs 161 If we tell you that we will not pay for all or part of th e medical care or drug, you can make an appeal If you think we have made a mistake in turn ing down your request for payment or you don't agree with the amount we are paying, you can make an appeal. If you make an appeal, it means you are asking us to change the decision we made when we turned down your request for payment. For the details on how to make this appeal, see the \"What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints )\" section of this bookl et. The appeals process is a formal process with detailed procedures and important deadlin es. If making an appeal is new to you, you will find it helpful to start by reading the \"A guide to 'the basics' of coverage decisions and appeals\" portion in this section. This introduct ion explains the process for coverage decisions and appeals a nd gives definitions of terms such as \"appeal.\" Then after you have read the \"A guide to 'the basics' of cove rage decisions and appeals\" portion, you can go to the section in \"What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) that tells what to do for your situation: If you want to make an appeal about getting paid back for a medica l service or drug, see the \"What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)\" section of this booklet. Other situations in which you should save your receipts and send copies to the plan In some cases, you should send copies of y our receipts to us to help us track your Part D out-of-pocket drug costs There are some situations when you should let us know about payments you have made for your Part D drugs. In these cases, you are not asking us for payment. Instead, you are telling us about your payments so that we can calculate your Part D out-of-pocket costs correctly. This may help you to qualify for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage more quickly. Here are two situations when you should send us copies of receipts to let us know about payments you have made for your drugs: 1. When you buy a Part D drug for a price that is lower than our price Sometimes you can buy your drug at a network pharmacy for a price that is lower than the plan's price. For example, a pharmacy might offer a special price on the drug. Or you may have a discount card that is out side our benefit that offers a lower price. Unless special conditions apply, you must use a network pharmacy in these situations and your drug must be on our Drug List. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have re ceived for covered medical services or drugs 162 Save your receipt and send a copy to us so th at we can have your Part D out-of-pocket expenses count toward qualifying you fo r the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. Please note: If you are in the Coverage Gap Stage , we may not pay for any share of these drug costs. But sending a copy of the r eceipt allows us to cal culate your Part D out-of-pocket costs correctly and may help you qualify for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage more quickly. 2. When you get a Part D drug through a patient assistance program offered by a drug manufacturer Some members are enrolled in a patient assi stance program offered by a drug manufacturer that is outside the plan benefits. If you get any Part D drugs through a program offered by a drug manufacturer, you may pay a copaymen t to the patient assistance program. Save your receipt and send a copy to us so th at we can have your Part D out-of-pocket expenses count toward qualifying you fo r the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. Please note: Because you are getting your drug through the patient assistance program and not through the plan's benefits, we will not pay for any share of these drug costs. But sending a copy of the receipt allows us to calculate your Part D out-of-pocket costs correctly and may help you qua lify for the Catastrophic Cove rage Stage more quickly. Since you are not asking for payment in the two cas es described above, these situations are not considered coverage decisions. Therefore, you ca nnot make an appeal if you disagree with our decision. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Your rights and responsibilities 163 YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES Our plan must honor your rights as a member of the plan We must provide information in a way th at works for you (in languages other than English, in audio, in large print, or othe r alternate formats, etc.) To get information from us in a way that wo rks for you, please call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).

The legal documents that you can use to give your directions in advance in these situations are called \" advance directives .\" There are different types of adva nce directives and different names for them. Documents called \" living will \" and \" power of attorney for health care \" are examples of advance directives. If you want to use an \"advance directive\" to gi ve your instructions, he re is what to do: Get the form. If you want to have an advance directive, you can get a form from your lawyer, from a social worker, from the Ca lifornia Medical Association by calling 1-800- 786-4262 (National Relay Service 711) or fr om some office supply stores. You can sometimes get advance directive forms from or ganizations that give people information about Medicare. Fill it out and sign it. Regardless of where you get this form, keep in mind that it is a legal document. You should consider having a la wyer help you prepare it. In California, the advance directive must be either acknowledged before a no tary public or signed by at least two witnesses who satis fy the requirements set forth in Ann. Cal. Prob. Code Sections 4674 and 4675. Give copies to appropriate people. You should give a copy of the form to your doctor and to the person you name on the form as the one to make decisions for you if you can't. You may want to give copies to close friends or family member s as well. Be sure to keep a copy at home. If you know ahead of time that you are going to be hospitalized, and you have signed an advance directive, take a copy with you to the hospital . If you are admitted to the hospital, they will ask you whether you have signed an advance directive form and whether you have it with you. If you have not signed an advance directive form, the hospital has forms available and will ask if you want to sign one. Remember, it is your choice whether you want to fill out an advance directive (including whether you want to sign one if you are in th e hospital). According to law, no one can deny you care or discriminate against you based on whether or not you have signed an advance directive.

It has the for ce of a physician's medical order and remains with you wherever you receive care.

Health Net, Inc. follows Medicare's Nationa l and Local Coverage Determinations when applicable. In the absence of a Medicare coverage determinati on, Health Net assesses technology through an established process for recognizing an d evaluating advances in new technologies and new applications of existing technologies which should be included in ap plicable benefit plans and to ensure members have access to safe and effective care. Health Net, Inc. may rely upon published evaluations and clinical recommendations of recognized experts (e.g., national medical associations, independent medical panels, t echnology assessment organizations, and practicing physicians). Such experts base their evaluations and findings on the scie ntific quality of the supporting evidence and rationale for the new tec hnologies or new applications. Health Net, Inc.'s Medical Advisory Council has the res ponsibility for assessing new technology and new applications and for me dical policy decisions.

For other types of probl ems you need to use the process for making complaints . Both of these processes have been approved by Medicare. To ensure fairness and prompt handling of your problems, each process has a set of rules, procedures, and deadlines that must be followed by us and by you. Which one do you use? That depends on the type of problem you are having. The guide in the \"To deal with your problem, which process s hould you use?\" portion will help you identify the right process to use. For information on Appeals procedures for your Employer-Sponsored Bene fits (benefits beyond the basic Medicare-covered bene fits), please refer to the \"Appeals Procedures for your Employer-Sponsored Benefits\" porti on later in th is section. What about the legal terms? There are technical legal terms for some of the rules, procedures, and types of deadlines explained in this section. Many of these terms are unfamiliar to most people and can be hard to understand. To keep things simple, this se ction explains the lega l rules and procedures using simpler words in place of certain legal terms. For example, this section generally says \"making a complaint\" rather than \"filing view Organization\" of \"Independent Review Entity.\" It also uses abbr eviations as little as possible. However, it can be helpful - and sometimes quite important - for you to know the correct legal terms for the situation you are in. Knowing wh ich terms to use will help you communicate more clearly and accurately when you are dealing wi th your problem and ge t the right help or information for your situation. To help you know which terms to use, we include legal terms when we give the details for hand ling specific types of situations. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 176 You can get help from government organizations that are not connected with us Where to get more information and personalized assistance Sometimes it can be confusing to start or follow through the process for dealing with a problem.

The guide that follows will help. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 177 To figure out which part of this section will help with your specific problem or concern, START HERE Is your problem or concern about your benefits or coverage? (This includes problems about whether partic ular medical care or prescription drugs are covered or not, the way in which they are covered, and problems related to payment for medical care or pres cription drugs.) Yes. My problem is about be nefits or coverage. Go on to the section \" A guide to 'the basics' of coverage decisions and appeals .\" No. My problem is not about benefits or coverage. Skip ahead to section: \"How to make a compla int about quality of care, waiting times, customer service, or other concerns.\" COVERAGE DECISIONS AND APPEALS A guide to 'the basics' of coverage decisions and appeals Asking for coverage decisions and making appeals: the big picture The process for coverage decisions and appeals deals with problems related to your benefits and coverage for medical services and pres cription drugs, including problems related to payment. This is the process you use for issues such as whether something is covered or not and the way in which something is covered. Asking for coverage decisions A coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits a nd coverage or about the amount we will pay for your medical services or drugs. For example, your plan network doctor makes a (favorable) coverage decision fo r you whenever you receive medical care from him or her or if your network doctor refers you to a medical special ist. You or your doctor can also contact us and ask for a coverage decision if your doctor is unsure whether we will cover a particular medical service or refuse to pr ovide medical care you think that you need. In other words, if you want to know if we will cover a medical service before you receive it, you can ask us to make a coverage decision for you. We are making a coverage decision for you whenev er we decide what is covered for you and how much we pay. In some cases we might deci de a service or drug is not covered or is no 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 178 longer covered by Medicare for you. If you disagr ee with this coverage decision, you can make an appeal. Making an appeal If we make a coverage decision and you are not satisfied with this decision, you can \"appeal\" the decision. An appeal is a formal way of asking us to review and change a coverage decision we have made. When you make an appeal, we review the coverage decision we have made to check to see if we were following all of the rules properly. Your app eal is handled by different reviewers than those who made the original unfavorable decision. When we have completed the review we give you our decision. If we say no to all or part of your Level 1 A ppeal, you can go on to a Level 2 Appeal. The Level 2 Appeal is conducted by an independent organi zation that is not conne cted to us. (In some situations, your case will be au tomatically sent to the independent organization for a Level 2 Appeal. If this happens, we w ill let you know. In other situations, you will need to ask for a Level 2 Appeal.) If you are not satisfied with the decision at the Level 2 Appeal, you may be able to continue through a dditional levels of appeal. How to get help when you are asking fo r a coverage decision or making an appeal Would you like some help? Here are resources you ma y wish to use if you decide to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision: You can call us at Member Services (phone numbers are printe d on the back cover of this booklet).

Your doctor or other provider can make a request for you. o For Part D prescription drugs, your doctor or other prescrib er can request a coverage decision or a Level 1 or 2 appeal on your behalf. To request any appeal after Level 2, your doctor or other pr escriber must be appointed as your representative. o For medical care, your doctor can request a coverage decision or a Level 1 appeal on your behalf. If your appeal is denied at Level 1, it will be automatically forwarded to Level 2.

Which portion of this section gives the details for your situation? There are four different types of situations that invol ve coverage decisions and appeals. Since each situation has different rules and deadlines, we give the details for each one separately. Please refer to the following portions of this section for more information: \"Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal\" \"Your prescription drugs: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal\" \"How to ask us to cover a longer inpatient hospital stay if you think the doctor is discharging you too soon\" \"How to ask us to keep covering cert ain medical services if you think your coverage is ending too soon\" (This portion of this section applies to these services only: home health care, skilled nursi ng facility care, and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services) If you're still not sure which portion of this sectio n you should be using, please call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). You can also get help or information from government organizations such as your SHIP (the \"Important phone numbers and resources\" section of this bookl et has the phone numbers for this program). 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 180 Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal Have you read the portion called \" A guide to 'the basics' of coverage decisions and appeals \"? If not, you may want to read it before you start this portion. This portion tells what to do if you ha ve problems getting coverage for medical care or if you want us to pay you back for our share of the cost of your care This portion is about your benefits for medical ca re and services. These benefits are described in the \"Medical Benefits Chart (w hat is covered and what you pay) \" section of this booklet. To keep things simple, we generally refer to \"medical care coverage\" or \"medical care\" in the rest of this section, instead of rep eating \"medical care or treatm ent or services\" every time. This portion tells what you can do if you ar e in any of the five following situations: 1. You are not getting certain medical care you want, and you believe that this care is covered by our plan. 2. Our plan will not approve the medical care your doctor or other medical provider wants to give you, and you believe that this care is covered by the plan. 3. You have received medical care or services that you believe should be covered by the plan, but we have said we will not pay for this care. 4. You have received and paid for medical care or services that you be lieve should be covered by the plan, and you want to ask our pl an to reimburse you for this care. 5. You are being told that coverage for certain medical care you have been getting that we previously approved will be reduced or stopped, and you believe that reducing or stopping this care could harm your health. NOTE: If the coverage that will be stopped is for hospital care, home health care, skilled nursing facility ca re, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services , you need to read a separate portion of this section because special ru les apply to these types of care. Here's what to read in those situations: o The \"How to ask us to cover a longer inpatient hospital stay if you think the doctor is discharging you too soon\" por tion of the \"What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)\"section of this booklet . o The \"How to ask us to keep covering certain medical services if you think your coverage is ending too soon\" portion of the \"What to do if you have a problem 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 181 or complaint (coverage decisions, appeal s, complaints)\" section of the booklet tells about three services only: home heal th care, skilled nursing facility care, and CORF services. For all other situations that involve being told that medical ca re you have been getting will be stopped, use this portion (\"Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal\") of this section as your guide for what to do. Which of these situations are you in? If you are in this situation: This is what you can do: Do you want to find out whether we will cover the medical care or services you want? You can ask us to make a coverage decision for you. Go to the next portion of this section, \"Step- by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision (how to ask our plan to authorize or provide the medical care coverage you want)\" . Have we already told you that we will not cover or pay fo r a medical service in the way that you want it to be covered or paid for? You can make an appeal . (This means you are asking us to reconsider.) Skip ahead to the \" Step-by-step: How to make a Level 1 Appeal (how to ask for a review of a medi cal care coverage decision made by our plan)\" portion of this section. Do you want to ask us to pay you back for medical care or services you have already received and paid for? You can send us the bill. Skip ahead to the \"What if you are asking us to pay you for our share of a bill you have received for medical care?\" portion of this section. Step-by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision (how to ask our plan to authorize or provide the medical care coverage you want) 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 182 Legal Terms When a coverage decision involves your medical care, it is called an \"organization determination.\" Step 1: You ask our plan to make a co verage decision on the medical care you are requesting. If your health requires a quick respons e, you should ask us to make a \"fast coverage decision.\" Legal Terms A \"fast coverage decision\" is called an \"expedited determination.\" How to request coverage for the medical care you want Start by calling, writing, or fa xing our plan to make your request for us to authorize or provide covera ge for the medical care you want. You, your doctor, or your representative can do this. For the details on how to contact us, see the \"Important phone numbers and resources\" section of this bookl et, and look for the portion called, How to contact us when you are asking for a coverag e decision about your medical care. Generally we use the standard deadlines for giving you our decision When we give you our decision, we will use the \"standard\" deadlines unless we have agreed to use the \"fast\" deadlines. A standard coverage decision means we will give you an answer within 14 days after we receive your request. However, we can take up to 14 more calendar days if you ask for more time, or if we need information (such as medical re cords from out-of-network providers) that may benefit you. If we decide to take extra days to make the decision, we will tell you in writing. If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to take extra days. When you file a fast complaint, we will give you an answer to your complaint within 24 hours. (The process for making a complaint is different from the process for coverage decisions and appeals. For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see the \"How to make a complaint about quality of care, waiting times, customer service, or other concerns\" portion of this section.) If your health requires it, ask us to give you a \"fast coverage decision\" 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 183 A fast coverage decision means we will answer within 72 hours. o However, we can take up to 14 more calendar days if we find that some information that may benefit you is missing (such as medical records from out-of-network providers), or if you need time to get information to us for the review. If we decide to take ex tra days, we will tell you in writing. o If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to take extra days . (For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see the \"How to make a complaint about quality of care, waiting times, customer service, or other concerns\" portion of this section.) We will call you as soon as we make the decision. To get a fast coverage decision , you must meet two requirements: o You can get a fast coverage decision only if you are asking for coverage for medical care you have not yet received . You cannot get a fast coverage decision if your request is about paym ent for medical care you have already received. o You can get a fast coverage decision only if using the standard deadlines could cause serious harm to your health or hurt your ability to function. If your doctor tells us that your health requires a \"fast coverage decision,\" we will automatically agree to give you a fast coverage decision. If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own, without your doctor's support, we will decide whether your health requi res that we give you a fast coverage decision. o If we decide that your medical conditi on does not meet the requirements for a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that says so (and we will use the standard deadlines instead). o This letter will tell you that if your doctor asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give a fast coverage decision. o The letter will also tell how you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to give you a standard coverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you requested. (For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see the \"How to make a complaint about quality of care, waiting times, customer service, or other concerns\" portion of this section.) Step 2: We consider your request for me dical care coverage and we give you our answer. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 184 Deadlines for a \"fast\" coverage decision Generally, for a fast coverage de cision, we will give you our answer within 72 hours . o As explained above, we can take up to 14 more calendar days under certain circumstances. If we decide to take ex tra days to make the coverage decision, we will tell you in writing. If we take extra days, it is called \"an extended time period.\" o If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to take extra days. Wh en you file a fast complaint, we will give you an answer to your complaint w ithin 24 hours. (For more information about the process for making complaints , including fast co mplaints, see the \"How to make a complaint about qua lity of care, waiting times, customer service, or other concerns\" portion of this section.). If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the medical care coverage we have agreed to provide within 72 hours after we received your request. If we extended the time needed to make our coverage decision, we will provide the coverage by the end of that extended period. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you a detailed written explanation as to why we said no. Deadlines for a \"standard\" coverage decision Generally, for a standard coverage decision, we will give you our answer within 14 days of receiving your request. o We can take up to 14 more calendar da ys (\"an extended time period\") under certain circumstances. If we decide to take extra days to make the coverage decision, we will tell you in writing. o If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to take extra days. Wh en you file a fast complaint, we will give you an answer to your complaint w ithin 24 hours. (For more information about the process for making complaints , including fast co mplaints, see the \"How to make a complaint about qua lity of care, waiting times, customer service, or other concerns \" portion of this section.) o If we do not give you our answer within 14 days (or if there is an extended time period, by the end of that period), you have the right to appeal. The \"Step-by- step: How to make a Level 1 Appeal (how to ask for a review of a medical care coverage decision made by our plan)\" portion below tells how to make an appeal. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 185 If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the coverage we have agreed to provide within 14 days after we received your request. If we extended the time needed to make our coverage decision, we will provide the coverage by the e nd of that extended period. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested , we will send you a written statement that explains why we said no. Step 3: If we say no to your request fo r coverage for medical care, you decide if you want to make an appeal. If we say no, you have the right to ask us to reconsider - and perhaps change - this decision by making an appeal. Making an app eal means making another try to get the medical care coverage you want. If you decide to make an appeal, it mean s you are going on to Level 1 of the appeals process (see the \"Step-by-step: Ho w to make a Level 1 Appeal (how to ask for a review of a medical care coverage decision made by our plan)\" portion below. Step-by-step: How to make a Level 1 Appeal (how to ask for a review of a medical care coverage decision made by our plan) Legal Terms An appeal to the plan about a medical care coverage decision is called a plan \"reconsideration.\" Step 1: You contact us and make your appeal. If your health requires a quick response, you must ask for a \"fast appeal.\" What to do To start an appeal you, your doctor or your representative, must contact our plan. For details on how to reach us for any purpose related to your appeal, see the \"Important phone numbers and reso urces\" section of this booklet. If you are asking for a standard appeal , make your standard appeal in writing by submitting a request. o If you have someone appealing our d ecision for you other than your doctor, your appeal must include an Appointment of Representative form authorizing 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 186 this person to represent you. (To get th e form, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) and ask for the \"Appointment of Representative\" form. It is also available on Medicare's website at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/cmsforms/downloads/cms1696.pdf or on our website at www.healthnet.com/uc.) While we can accept an appeal request without the form, we cannot comp lete our review until we receive it. If we do not receive the form within 44 days after receiving your appeal request (our deadline for making a deci sion on your appeal), your appeal request will be dismissed. If this happ ens, we will send you a written notice explaining your right to ask the Indepe ndent Review Organi zation to review our decision. If you are asking for a fast appeal, ma ke your appeal in writing or call us at the phone number shown in the \"Important phone numbers and resources\" section of this booklet. You must make your appeal request within 60 calendar days from the date on the written notice we sent to tell you our answer to your request for a coverage decision. If you miss this deadline and ha ve a good reason for missing it, we may give you more time to make your appeal. Examples of good cause for missing the deadline may include if you had a seri ous illness that prevented you from contacting us or if we provided you with in correct or incomplete information about the deadline for requesting an appeal. You can ask for a copy of the inform ation regarding your medical decision and add more information to support your appeal. o You have the right to ask us for a copy of the information regarding your appeal. o If you wish, you and your doctor may give us additional information to support your appeal. Legal Terms A \"fast appeal\" is also called an \"expedited reconsideration.\" If your health requires it, a sk for a \"fast appeal\" (you can make a request by calling us) If you are appealing a decision we made a bout coverage for care you have not yet received, you and/or your docto r will need to decide if you need a \"fast appeal.\" The requirements and procedures for getting a \"fast appeal\" are the same as those for getting a \"fast coverage decision.\" To ask fo r a fast appeal, follow the instructions for 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 187 asking for a fast coverage decision. (These instructions are given earlier in this section.) If your doctor tells us that your health requi res a \"fast appeal,\" we will give you a fast appeal. Step 2: We consider your appe al and we give you our answer. When our plan is reviewing your appeal, we take another careful look at all of the information about your request for coverage of medical care. We check to see if we were following all the rules when we said no to your request. We will gather more information if we need it. We may contact you or your doctor to get more information. Deadlines for a \"fast\" appeal When we are using the fast deadlin es, we must give you our answer within 72 hours after we receive your appeal . We will give you our answer sooner if your health requires us to do so. o However, if you ask for more time, or if we need to gather more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more calendar days. If we decide to take extra days to make the de cision, we will tell you in writing. o If we do not give you an answer within 72 hours (or by the end of the extended time period if we took extra days), we are required to auto matically send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals proce ss, where it will be reviewed by an independent organization. Later in th is section, we tell you about this organization and explain wh at happens at Level 2 of the appeals process. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the coverage we have agreed to provide within 72 hours after we receive your appeal. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you a written denial notice informing you that we have automatically sent your appeal to the Independent Review Organization for a Level 2 Appeal. Deadlines for a \"standard\" appeal If we are using the standard dead lines, we must give you our answer within 30 calendar days after we receive your appeal if your appeal is about coverage for services you have not yet received. We will give you our decision sooner if your health condition requires us to. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 188 o However, if you ask for more time, or if we need to gather more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more calendar days. o If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to take extra days. Wh en you file a fast complaint, we will give you an answer to your complaint w ithin 24 hours. (For more information about the process for making complaints , including fast co mplaints, see the \"How to make a complaint about qua lity of care, waiting times, customer service, or other concerns \" portion of this section.) o If we do not give you an answer by the deadline above (or by the end of the extended time period if we took extra days), we are required to send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals proce ss, where it will be reviewed by an independent outside organization. Later in th is section, we talk about this review organization and explain wh at happens at Level 2 of the appeals process. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the coverage we have agreed to provide within 30 days after we receive your appeal. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested , we will send you a written denial notice informing you that we have automatically sent your appeal to the Independent Review Organiza tion for a Level 2 Appeal. Step 3: If our plan says no to part or all of your appea l, your case will automatically be sent on to the next l evel of the appeals process. To make sure we were following all the rules when we said no to your appeal, we are required to send your appeal to the \"Independent Review Organization.\" When we do this, it means that your appeal is going on to the next le vel of the appeals process, which is Level 2. Step-by-step: How Level 2 Appeal is done If we say no to your Level 1 Appeal, your case will automatically be sent on to the next level of the appeals process. During the Level 2 Appeal, the Independent Review Organization reviews our decision for your first appeal. This orga nization decides whether the decision we made should be changed. Legal Terms The formal name for the \"Independent Review Organization\" is the \"Independent Review Entity.\" It is sometimes called the \"IRE.\" 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 189 Step 1: The Independent Review Organization reviews your appeal. The Independent Review Organization is an independent organization that is hired by Medicare . This organization is not conn ected with us and it is not a government agency. This organization is a company chosen by Medicare to handle the job of being the Independent Review Organization. Medicare oversees its work. We will send the information about your appe al to this organization. This information is called your \"case file.\" You have the right to ask us for a copy of your case file . You have a right to give the Independent Review Organization additional information to support your appeal. Reviewers at the Independent Review Organi zation will take a careful look at all of the information related to your appeal. If you had a \"fast\" appeal at Level 1, you will also have a \"fast\" appeal at Level 2 If you had a fast appeal to our plan at Le vel 1, you will automatically receive a fast appeal at Level 2. The review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal within 72 hours of when it receives your appeal. However, if the Independent Review Organi zation needs to gather more information that may benefit you, it can take up to 14 more calendar days . If you had a \"standard\" appeal at Lev el 1, you will also have a \"standard\" appeal at Level 2 If you had a standard appeal to our plan at Level 1, you will automatically receive a standard appeal at Level 2. The review or ganization must give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal within 30 calendar days of when it receives your appeal. However, if the Independent Review Organi zation needs to gather more information that may benefit you, it can take up to 14 more calendar days . Step 2: The Independent Review Or ganization gives you their answer. The Independent Review Organization will tell yo u its decision in writing and explain the reasons for it. If the review organization says yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize the medical care c overage within 72 hours or pr ovide the service within 14 calendar days after we receive the de cision from the review organization. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 190 If this organization says no to part or all of your appeal , it means they agree with us that your request (or part of your request ) for coverage for medical care should not be approved. (This is called \"upholding the de cision.\" It is also called \"turning down your appeal.\") o There is a certain dollar value that must be in dispute to continue with the appeals process. For example, to conti nue and make another appeal at Level 3, the dollar value of the me dical care coverage you ar e requesting must meet a certain minimum. If the dollar value of the coverage you are requesting is too low, you cannot make another appeal, wh ich means that the decision at Level 2 is final. The written notice you get from the Independent Review Organization will tell you how to find out the dollar amount to continue the appeals process. Step 3: If your case meets the requireme nts, you choose whether you want to take your appeal further. There are three additional levels in the app eals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal). If your Level 2 Appeal is turned down a nd you meet the requirements to continue with the appeals process, you must decide whether you wa nt to go on to Level 3 and make a third appeal. The details on how to do this are in the written notice you got after your Level 2 Appeal. The Level 3 Appeal is handled by an ad ministrative law judge. The \"Taking your appeal to Level 3 and beyond\" portion in this section tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. What if you are asking us to pay you for our share of a bill you have received for medical care? If you want to ask our plan for payment for medi cal care, start by reading the \"Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have rece ived for covered medical servic es or drugs\" section of this booklet. This section describes the situations in which you may need to ask for reimbursement or to pay a bill you have received from a provider. It also tells how to send us the paperwork that asks us for payment. Asking for reimbursement is asking for a coverage decision from us If you send us the paperwork that asks for reimbursement, you are asking us to make a coverage decision (for more information about covera ge decisions, see the \"Asking for coverage decisions and making appeals: the big picture\" portion of this sect ion). To make this coverage decision, we will check to see if the medical car e you paid for is a covered service (see the \"Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section of this booklet). We will also check to see if you followed all the rules fo r using your coverage for medical care (these 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 191 rules are given in the \"Using the plan's covera ge for your medical services\" section of this booklet). We will say yes or no to your request If the medical care you paid for is covere d and you followed all th e rules, we will send you the payment for our share of the cost of your medical care within 60 calendar days after we receive your request. Or, if you have n't paid for the serv ices, we will send the payment directly to the provider. (When we send the payment, it's the same as saying yes to your request for a coverage decision.) If the medical care is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, we will not send payment. Instead, we will send you a letter that says we will not pay for the services and the reasons why in detail. (When we turn dow n your request for payment, it's the same as saying no to your request for a coverage decision.) What if you ask for payment and we say that we will not pay? If you do not agree with our decision to turn you down, you can make an appeal . If you make an appeal, it means you are asking us to change th e coverage decision we made when we turned down your request for payment. To make this appeal, follow the process for appe als that we describe in the \"Step-by-step: How to make a Level 1 Appeal (how to ask for a review of a medical care coverage decision made by our plan)\" portion of this section . Go to this part for step -by-step instructions. When you are following these inst ructions, please note: If you make an appeal for reimbursement, we must give you our answer within 60 calendar days after we receive your appeal. (If you are asking us to pay you back for medical care you have already received and pa id for yourself, you are not allowed to ask for a fast appeal.) If the Independent Review Organization revers es our decision to deny payment, we must send the payment you have requested to you or to the provider within 30 calendar days. If the answer to your appeal is ye s at any stage of the appeals process after Level 2, we must send the payment you requested to you or to the provider within 60 calendar days. Your prescription drugs: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal Have you read the section \" A guide to 'the basics' of coverage decisions and appeals \"? If not, you may want to read it before you start this section. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 192 This section tells you what to do if y ou have problems getting a drug or you want us to pay you back for a drug Your benefits as a member of our plan incl ude coverage for many prescription drugs. Please refer to our plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary). To be covered, the drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. (A \"medically accepte d indication\" is a use of the drug that is either approved by the Food and Drug Administ ration or supported by certain reference books. See the \"Your drugs need to be on the plan's 'Drug List'\" portion of the \"Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs\" section of this booklet for more information about a medically accepted indication.) This section is about your Part D drugs only. To keep things simple, we generally say \"drug\" in the rest of this section, instead of repea ting \"covered outpatient prescription drug\" or \"Part D drug\" every time. For details about what we mean by Part D drugs, the List of Covered Drugs , (Formulary ) rules and restrictions on coverage, and co st information, see the \"Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs\" and \"What you pay for your prescription drugs\" sections of this booklet. Coverage decisions and appeals As discussed in the \"A guide to 'the basics' of coverage decisions and appeals\" portion of this section, a coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about the amount we will pay for your drugs. Legal Terms An initial coverage decision about your Part D drugs is called a \"coverage determination.\" Here are examples of coverage decisions you ask us to make about your drugs: You ask us to make an exception, including: o Asking us to cover a drug that is not on the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) o Asking us to waive a restri ction on the plan's coverage for a drug (such as limits on the amount of the drug you can get) o Asking to pay a lower cost-sharing amount for a covered Part D drug on Tier 3 (Non-preferred brand drugs) or Tier 4 (Injectable Drugs) You ask us whether a drug is covered for you and whether you satisfy any applicable coverage rules. (For example, when your drug is on the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) but we require you to get approval from us before we will cover it for you.) 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 193 o Please note: If your pharmacy tells you that you r prescription cannot be filled as written, you will get a written notice explaining how to contact us to ask for a coverage decision. You ask us to pay for a prescription drug you already bought. This is a request for a coverage decision about payment. If you disagree with a coverage decision we have made, you can appeal our decision. This section tells you both how to ask for coverage decisions and how to request an appeal. Use this chart below to help you determine which part has information for your situation: 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 194 Which of these situations are you in? Do you need a drug that isn't on our Drug List or need us to waive a rule or restriction on a drug we cover? Do you want us to cover a drug on our Drug List and you believe you meet any plan rules or restrictions (such as getting approval in advance) for the drug you need? Do you want to ask us to pay you back for a drug you have already received and paid for? Have we already told you that we will not cover or pay for a drug in the way that you want it to be covered or paid for? You can ask us to make an exception. (This is a type of coverage decision.) Start with the \"What is an exception?\" portion of this section. You can ask us for a coverage decision. Skip ahead to the \"Step-by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision, including an exception\" portion of this section. You can ask us to pay you back. (This is a type of coverage decision.)

Skip ahead to the \"Step-by-step: How to make a Level 1 Appeal (how to ask for a review of a coverage decision made by our plan) portion of this section. What is an exception? If a Part D drug is not covere d in the way you would like it to be covered, you can ask us to make an \"exception.\" An exception is a type of coverage decision. Simila r to other types of coverage decisions, if we turn down your request for an excep tion, you can appeal our decision. When you ask for an exception, your doctor or other prescriber will need to explain the medical reasons why you need the exception approved. We will then consider your request. Here are three examples of exceptions that you or your do ctor or other prescriber can ask us to make: 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 195 1. Covering a drug for you that is not on our List of Covered Drugs (Formulary). (We call it the \"Drug List\" for short.) Legal Terms Asking for coverage of a drug that is not on the Drug List is sometimes called asking for a \"formulary exception.\" If we agree to make an exception and cove r a drug that is not on the Drug List, you will need to pay the cost-sharing amount that applies to drugs in Tier 3 (Non- preferred brand drug) . If we agree to make an exception and c over a Part D drug, you cannot ask for an exception to the copayment or coinsurance amount we require you to pay for the Part D drug. 2. Removing a restriction on our coverage for a covered drug . There are extra rules or restrictions that apply to certain drugs on our List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) (for more information, go to the \"Using the plan's coverage for your prescription drugs\" section of this booklet). Legal Terms Asking for removal of a restriction on coverage for a drug is sometimes called asking for a \"formulary exception.\" The extra rules and restrictions on coverage for certain drugs include: o Being required to use the generic version of a drug instead of the brand name drug. o Getting plan approval in advance before we will agree to cover the drug for you. (This is sometimes called \"prior authorization.\") o Being required to try a different drug first before we will agree to cover the drug you are asking for. (This is sometimes called \"step therapy.\") o Quantity limits . For some drugs, there are rest rictions on the amount of the drug you can have. If we agree to make an exception and wa ive a restriction on a Part D drug for you, you can ask for an exception to the copaym ent or coinsurance amount we require you to pay for the drug. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 196 3. Changing coverage of a drug to a lower cos t-sharing tier (this type of exception only applies to Part D drugs). Every drug on our Drug List is in one of the cost-sharing tiers. In general, the lower the cost-shari ng tier number, the less you will pa y as your share of the cost of the drug. Legal Terms Asking to pay a lower preferred price for a covered non- preferred Part D drug is sometimes called asking for a \"tiering exception.\" If your Part D drug is in Ti er 3 (Non-preferred brand dr ugs) or Tier 4 (Injectable Drugs), you can ask us to cover it at the co st-sharing amount that applies to drugs in Tier 2 (Preferred brand drugs). This would lower your share of the cost for the drug. You cannot ask us to change the cost-shari ng tier for any drug in Tier 2 (Preferred brand drugs), Tier 5 (Specialty Drugs), or non-Part D drugs. Important things to know about asking for exceptions Your doctor must tell us the medical reasons Your doctor or other prescriber must give us a statement that explains the medical reasons for requesting an exception. For a fast er decision, include this medical information from your doctor or other prescriber when you ask for the exception. Typically, our Drug List includes more than one drug for treating a partic ular condition. These different possibilities ar e called \"alternative\" drugs. If an alternative drug would be just as effective as the drug you are requesting and would not cause more side effects or other health problems, we will generally not approve your request for an exception. We can say yes or no to your request If we approve your request for an exception, our approval usually is valid until the end of the year. This is true as long as your docto r continues to prescribe the drug for you and that drug continues to be safe and effective for trea ting your condition. If we say no to your request for an exception, you can ask for a review of our decision by making an appeal. The \"Step-by-step: How to make a Level 1 Appeal (how to ask for a review of a coverage decision made by our pl an)\" portion of this section tells how to make an appeal if we say no. The next section tells you how to ask for a coverage decision, in cluding an exception. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 197 Step-by-step: How to ask for a cover age decision, including an exception Step 1: You ask us to make a coverage decision about the drug(s) or payment you need . If your health requires a quick r esponse, you must ask us to make a \"fast coverage decision.\" Y ou cannot ask for a fast co verage decision if you are asking us to pay you back fo r a drug you already bought. What to do Request the type of cov erage decision you want. Start by calling, writing, or faxing us to make your request. You, your representative, or your doctor (or other prescriber) can do this. You can also acce ss the coverage decision process through our website. For the details, go to the \"I mportant phone numbers and resources\" section of this booklet and look for the portion called, \"How to contact us when you are asking for a coverage decision about your prescription drugs.\" Or if you are asking us to pay you back for a drug, go to the portion called, \"Where to send a request asking us to pay for our share of the cost for medical care or a drug you have received.\" You or your doctor or someone else who is acting on your behalf can ask for a coverage decision. The \"A guide to 'the ba sics' of coverage d ecisions and appeals\" portion of this section tells how you can gi ve written permission to someone else to act as your representati ve. You can also have a la wyer act on your behalf. If you want to ask us to pay you back for a drug, start by reading the \"Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have receive d for covered medical services or drugs\" section of this booklet. The \"Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs\" section of this booklet describes the situations in which you may need to ask for reimbursement. It also tells how to send us the paperwork that asks us to pa y you back for our share of the cost of a drug you have paid for. If you are requesting an exception, provide the \"supporting statement.\" Your doctor or other prescriber must give us the medical reasons for the drug exception you are requesting. (We call this the \"supporti ng statement.\") Your doctor or other prescriber can fax or mail the statement to us. Or your doctor or other prescriber can tell us on the phone and follow up by fa xing or mailing a written statement if necessary. See the \"What is an exception? \" and \"Important things to know about asking for exceptions\" portions of this section for more information about exception requests.

A standard coverage decision means we will give you an answer within 72 hours after we receive your doctor's statement. A fast coverage decision means we will answer within 24 hours. To get a fast coverage decision , you must meet two requirements: o You can get a fast coverage d ecision only if you are asking for a drug you have not yet received . (You cannot get a fast coverage decision if you are asking us to pay you back for a drug you have already bought.) o You can get a fast coverage decision only if using the standard deadlines could cause serious harm to your health or hurt your abili ty to function. If your doctor or other prescriber tells us that your health requires a \"fast coverage decision,\" we will automatically agree to give you a fast coverage decision. If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own (without your doctor's or other prescriber's support), we will decide whether your health re quires that we give you a fast coverage decision. o If we decide that your medical conditi on does not meet the requirements for a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that says so (and we will use the standard deadlines instead). o This letter will tell you that if your doctor or other pres criber asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give a fast coverage decision. o The letter will also tell how you can file a complaint about our decision to give you a standard coverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you requested. It tells how to file a \"fas t\" complaint, which means you would get our answer to your complaint within 24 hours. (The process for making a complaint is different from the process for coverage decisions and appeals.

If the dollar value of the cove rage you are requesting is too low, you cannot make another appeal and the decision at Level 2 is final. The notice you get from the Independent Review Organization will tell you the dollar value that must be in dispute to continue with the appeals process. Step 3: If the dollar value of the coverage you are requesting meets the requirement, you choose whether you wa nt to take your appeal further.

Legal Terms A \"fast review\" is also called an \"immediate review.\" 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 208 What is the Quality Improvement Organization? This organization is a group of doctors a nd other health care pr ofessionals who are paid by the Federal government. These e xperts are not part of our plan. This organization is paid by Medicare to check on and help improve the quality of care for people with Medicare. This includes revi ewing hospital discharge dates for people with Medicare. How can you contact this organization? The written notice you received ( An Important Message from Medicare about Your Rights ) tells you how to reach this organiza tion.

What happens during this review? Health professionals at the Quality Improve ment Organization (we will call them \"the reviewers\" for short) will ask you (or your representative) why you believe coverage for the services should continue. You don't have to prepare anything in writing, but you may do so if you wish. The reviewers will also look at your medical information, talk with your doctor, and review information that the hospi tal and we have given to them. By noon of the day after the reviewers informed our plan of your appeal, you will also get a written notice that gives your planned discharge date and explains in detail the reasons why your doctor, th e hospital, and we think it is right (medically appropriate) for you to be discharged on that date.

Step 4: If the answer to your Level 1 App eal is no, you decide if you want to make another appeal. If the Quality Improvement Organization has turned down your appeal, and you stay in the hospital after your planned discharg e date, then you can make another appeal. Making another appeal means you are going on to \"Level 2\" of the appeals process. Step-by-step: How to make a Level 2 App eal to change your hospital discharge date If the Quality Improvement Organization has turned down your appeal, and you stay in the hospital after your planned discha rge date, then you can make a Level 2 Appeal. During a Level 2 Appeal, you ask the Quality Improvement Organi zation to take anothe r look at the decision they made on your first appeal. If the Quality Improvement Organization turns down your Level 2 Appeal, you may have to pay the full cost for your stay after your planned discharge date. Here are the steps for Level 2 of the appeal process: Step 1: You contact the Quality Improvement Organization again and ask for another review. You must ask for this review within 60 calendar days after the day when the Quality Improvement Organization said no to your Level 1 Appeal. You can ask for this review only if you stayed in th e hospital after the date that your coverage for the care ended. Step 2: The Quality Improvement Orga nization does a second review of your situation. Reviewers at the Quality Improvement Orga nization will take anot her careful look at all of the information re lated to your appeal. Step 3: Within 14 calendar days, the Qu ality Improvement Organization reviewers will decide on your appeal and tell you their decision. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 211 If the review organization says yes: We must reimburse you for our share of the costs of hospital care you have received since noon on the day after the date your fi rst appeal was turned down by the Quality Improvement Organization. We must continue providing coverage for your inpatient hospital care for as lo ng as it is medically necessary . You must continue to pay your share of the costs and coverage limitations may apply. If the review organization says no: It means they agree with the decision they made on your Level 1 Appeal and will not change it. This is called \"upholding the decision.\" The notice you get will tell you in writing wh at you can do if you wish to continue with the review process. It will give you the details about how to go on to the next level of appeal, which is handled by a judge. Step 4: If the answer is no, you will need to decide whether you want to take your appeal further by going on to Level 3. There are three additional levels in the appeal s process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal). If the review organi zation turns down your Level 2 Appeal, you can choose whether to accept that decision or wh ether to go on to Level 3 and make another appeal. At Level 3, your appeal is reviewed by a judge. The \"Taking your appeal to Level 3 and beyond\" portion in this section tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. What if you miss the deadline fo r making your Level 1 Appeal? You can appeal to us instead As explained above in the \"Step-by-step: How to make a Level 1 Appeal to change your hospital discharge date\" portion, you must act quickly to contact the Qu ality Improvement Organization to start your first appeal of your hospital discharge. (\"Quickl y\" means before you leave the hospital and no later than your pl anned discharge date.) If you miss the deadline for contacting this organization, there is anothe r way to make your appeal. If you use this other way of making your appeal, the first two levels of appeal are different. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 212 Step-by-Step: How to make a Level 1 Alternate Appeal If you miss the deadline for contacting the Qual ity Improvement Organization, you can make an appeal to us, asking for a \"fast re view.\" A fast review is an appeal that uses the fast deadlines instead of the sta ndard deadlines. Legal Terms A \"fast review\" (or \"fast appeal\") is also called an \"expedited appeal .\" Step 1: Contact us and ask for a \"fast review.\" For details on how to contact us, see th e \"Important phone numbers and resources\" section of this booklet, and look for the portion called, \"How to contact us when you are making an appeal about your medical care.\" Be sure to ask for a \"fast review .\" This means you are asking us to give you an answer using the \"fast\" deadlines ra ther than the \"standard\" deadlines. Step 2: We do a \"fast\" review of your plan ned discharge date, checking to see if it was medically appropriate. During this review, we take a look at all of the informa tion about your hospital stay. We check to see if your planned discharg e date was medically appropriate. We will check to see if the decision about when you should leave the hospital was fair and followed all the rules. In this situation, we will use the \"fast\" dead lines rather than the standard deadlines for giving you the answer to this review. Step 3: We give you our decision within 72 hours after you ask for a \"fast review\" (\"fast appeal\"). If we say yes to your fast appeal, it means we have agreed with you that you still need to be in the hospita l after the discharge date, and will keep providing your covered inpatient hospital services for as long as it is medically necessary. It also means that we have agreed to reimburs e you for our share of the costs of care you have received since the date when we sa id your coverage would end. (You must pay your share of the costs and there may be coverage limitations that apply.) If we say no to your fast appeal, we are saying that your planned discharge date was medically appropriate. Our coverage for your in patient hospital servic es ends as of the day we said coverage would end. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 213 If you stayed in the hospital after your planned discharge date, then you may have to pay the full cost of hospital care you received after the planned discharge date. Step 4: If we say no to your fast appeal, your case will automatically be sent on to the next level of the appeals process. To make sure we were following all the rule s when we said no to your fast appeal, we are required to send your appeal to the \"Independent Review Organization.\" When we do this, it means that you are automatically going on to Level 2 of the appeals process. Step-by-Step: How to make a Level 2 Alternate Appeal If we say no to your Level 1 Appeal, your case will automatically be sent on to the next level of the appeals process. During the Level 2 Appeal, the Independent Review Organization reviews the decision we made when we said no to your \"fast appeal.\" This orga nization decides whether the decision we made should be changed. Legal Terms The formal name for the \"Independent Review Organization\" is the \"Independent Review Entity.\" It is sometimes called the \"IRE.\" Step 1: We will automatically forwar d your case to the Independent Review Organization. We are required to send the information fo r your Level 2 Appeal to the Independent Review Organization within 24 hours of when we tell you that we are saying no to your first appeal. (If you think we are not m eeting this deadline or other deadlines, you can make a complaint. The complaint process is different from the appeal process. The \"How to make a complain t about quality of care, waiting times, customer service, or other concerns\" porti on of this section tells how to make a complaint.). Step 2: The Independent Review Orga nization does a \"fast review\" of your appeal. The reviewers give you an answer within 72 hours. The Independent Review Organization is an independent organization that is hired by Medicare . This organization is not connected with our plan and it is not a government agency. This organization is a company chosen by Medicare to handle the job of being the Independent Review Organization.

If this organization says yes to your appeal, then we must reimburse you (pay you back) for our share of the costs of hospital care you have received since the date of your planned discharge. We must also conti nue the plan's coverage of your inpatient hospital services for as long as it is medi cally necessary. You must continue to pay your share of the costs. If there are covera ge limitations, these could limit how much we would reimburse or how long we woul d continue to cover your services. If this organization says no to your appeal, it means they agree with us that your planned hospital discharge date was medically appropriate. o The notice you get from the Independent Review Organization will tell you in writing what you can do if you wish to con tinue with the review process. It will give you the details about how to go on to a Level 3 Appeal, which is handled by a judge. Step 3: If the Independent Review Or ganization turns down your appeal, you choose whether you want to take your appeal further. There are three additional levels in the app eals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal). If reviewers say no to your Level 2 Appeal, you decide whether to accept their decision or go on to Level 3 and make a third appeal. The \"Taking your appeal to Level 3 and be yond\" portion in this section tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. How to ask us to keep covering certai n medical services if you think your coverage is ending too soon This section is about three services only: Home health care, skilled nursing facility care, and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services This section is about th e following types of care only: Home health care services you are getting. Skilled nursing care you are getting as a patient in a skilled nursing facility. (To learn about requirement s for being considered a \"skilled nursing facility,\" see the \"Definitions of important words\" section in this booklet.) 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 215 Rehabilitation care you are getting as an outpati ent at a Medicare-approved Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilita tion Facility (CORF). Usually, this means you are getting treatment for an illness or accident, or you are recovering from a major operation. (For mo re information about this type of facility, see the \"Definiti ons of important words\" section in this booklet.) When you are getting any of these types of care, you have the right to keep getting your covered services for that type of care for as long as the care is needed to diagnose and treat your illness or injury. For more information on your covered serv ices, including your share of the cost and any limitations to coverage that may apply, see the \"Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section in this booklet. When we decide it is time to stop covering any of the three types of car e for you, we are required to tell you in advance. When your coverage for that care ends, we will stop paying our share of the cost for your care. If you think we are ending the coverage of your care too soon, you can appeal our decision . This section tells you how to ask for an appeal. We will tell you in advance when your coverage will be ending 1. You receive a notice in writing. At least two days before our plan is going to stop covering your care, the agency or facility that is provi ding your care will give you a notice. The written notice tells you the date when we will stop covering the care for you. The written notice also tells what you can do if you want to ask our plan to change this decision about when to end your care, and keep covering it for a longer period of time. Legal Terms In telling you what you can do, the written notice is telling how you can request a \"fast- track appeal.\" Requesting a fast-track appeal is a form al, legal way to request a change to our coverage decision about when to stop your care. ((The \"Step-by-Step: How to make a Level 1 Alternate Appeal\" portion below tells how you can request a fast-track appeal.) The written notice is called the \" Notice of Medicare Non-Coverage.\" To get a sample copy, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) or 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048). Or see a copy online at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/BNI/ 2. You must sign the written notice to show that you received it. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 216 You or someone who is acting on your behalf must sign the notice. (The \"A guide to 'the basics' of coverage d ecisions and appeals\" portion of this section tells how you can give written permission to someone else to act as your representative.) Signing the notice shows only that you have received the information about when your coverage will stop. Signing it does not mean you agree with the plan that it's time to stop getting the care. Step-by-step: How to make a Level 1 Appeal to have our plan cover your care for a longer time If you want to ask us to cover your care for a longer period of time, you will need to use the appeals process to make this request. Before you start, understand what you need to do and what the deadlines are. Follow the process. Each step in the first two levels of the appeals process is explained below. Meet the deadlines. The deadlines are important. Be sure that you understand and follow the deadlines that apply to things you must do. There are also deadlines our plan must follow. (If you think we are not meeting our deadlines, you can file a complaint. The \"How to make a complain t about quality of care, waiting times, customer service, or other concerns\" porti on of this section te lls you how to file a complaint.) Ask for help if you need it . If you have questions or need help at any time, please call Member Services (phone numbers are pr inted on the back cover of this booklet). Or call your State Health Insurance Assi stance Program, a government organization that provides personalized assistance (see the \"You can get help from government organizations that are not connected with us\" portion of this section). During a Level 1 Appeal, the Quality Improv ement Organization reviews your appeal and decides whether to change the decision made by our plan. Step 1: Make your Level 1 Appeal: cont act the Quality Improvement Organization in your state and ask for a r eview. You must act quickly. What is the Quality Improvement Organization? This organization is a group of doctors and other health care expe rts who are paid by the Federal government. These experts are no t part of our plan. They check on the quality of care received by people with Medi care and review plan decisions about when it's time to stop covering certain kinds of medical care. How can you contact this organization? 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 217 The written notice you received tells you how to reach this organization. (Or find the name, address, and phone number of the Qu ality Improvement Organization for your state in the \"Important phone numbers a nd resources,\" sectio n of this booklet.) What should you ask for? Ask this organization to do an independe nt review of whether it is medically appropriate for us to end cove rage for your medical services. Your deadline for contacting this organization. You must contact the Quality Improveme nt Organization to start your appeal no later than noon of the day after you receive the wr itten notice telling you when we will stop covering your care . If you miss the deadline for contacting th e Quality Improvement Organization about your appeal, you can make your appeal directly to us instead. Fo r details about this other way to make your appeal, see the \"What if you miss the deadline for making your Level 1 Appeal?\" portion of this section. Step 2: The Quality Improvement Organization conducts an independent review of your case. What happens during this review? Health professionals at the Quality Improve ment Organization (we will call them \"the reviewers\" for short) will ask you (or your representative) why you believe coverage for the services should continue. You don't have to prepare anything in writing, but you may do so if you wish. The review organization will also look at your medical information, talk with your doctor, and review information th at our plan has given to them. By the end of the day that the reviewers inform us of your appeal, you will also get a written notice from us that explains in detail our reasons for wanting to end our coverage for your services. Legal Terms This notice of explan ation is called the \" Detailed Explanation of Non-Coverage.\" 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 218 Step 3: Within one full day after they have all the information they need, the reviewers will tell you their decision. What happens if the reviewers say yes to your appeal? If the reviewers say yes to your appeal, then we must keep providing your covered services for as long as it is medically necessary. You will have to keep paying your share of the costs (such as deductibles or copayments, if these apply). In additi on, there may be limitations on your covered services (see the \"M edical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\" section of this booklet). What happens if the reviewers say no to your appeal? If the reviewers say no to your appeal, then your coverage will end on the date we have told you. We will stop paying our share of the costs of this care. If you decide to keep getting the home heal th care, skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabili tation Facility (CORF) services after this date when your coverage ends, then you will have to pay the full cost of this care yourself. Step 4: If the answer to your Level 1 App eal is no, you decide if you want to make another appeal. This first appeal you make is \"Level 1\" of the appeals proces s. If reviewers say no to your Level 1 Appeal - and you choose to cont inue getting care after your coverage for the care has ended - then you can make another appeal. Making another appeal means you are going on to \"Level 2\" of the appeals process. Step-by-step: How to make a Level 2 Appeal to have our plan cover your care for a longer time If the Quality Improvement Organization ha s turned down your appeal and you choose to continue getting care after your coverage for th e care has ended, then you can make a Level 2 Appeal. During a Level 2 Appeal, you ask the Qual ity Improvement Organiza tion to take another look at the decision they made on your first appeal. If the Qu ality Improvement Organization turns down your Level 2 Appeal, you may have to pa y the full cost for your home health care, or skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensiv e Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services after the date when we said your coverage would end. Here are the steps for Level 2 of the appeal process: 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 219 Step 1: You contact the Quality Improvement Organization again and ask for another review. You must ask for this review within 60 days after the day when the Quality Improvement Organization said no to your Level 1 Appeal. You can ask for this review only if you continued gett ing care after the date that your coverage for the care ended. Step 2: The Quality Improvement Orga nization does a second review of your situation. Reviewers at the Quality Improvement Orga nization will take anot her careful look at all of the information re lated to your appeal. Step 3: Within 14 days, the Quality Im provement Organization reviewers will decide on your appeal and tell you their decision. What happens if the review orga nization says yes to your appeal? We must reimburse you for our share of the costs of care you have received since the date when we said your coverage would end. We must continue providing coverage for the care for as long as it is medically necessary. You must continue to pay your share of the costs and there may be coverage limitations that apply. What happens if the review organization says no? It means they agree with the decision we made to your Level 1 Appeal and will not change it. The notice you get will tell you in writing wh at you can do if you wish to continue with the review process. It will give you the details about how to go on to the next level of appeal, which is handled by a judge. Step 4: If the answer is no, you will need to decide whether you want to take your appeal further. There are three additional levels of appeal after Level 2, for a total of five levels of appeal. If reviewers turn down your Level 2 Appeal, you can choose whether to 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 220 accept that decision or to go on to Level 3 and make another appeal. At Level 3, your appeal is reviewed by a judge. The \"Taking your appeal to Level 3 and be yond\" portion of this section tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. What if you miss the deadline fo r making your Level 1 Appeal? You can appeal to us instead As explained above, you must act quickly to co ntact the Quality Improve ment Organization to start your first appeal (within a day or two, at the most). If you miss th e deadline for contacting this organization, there is anothe r way to make your appeal. If you use this other way of making your appeal, the first two levels of appeal are different. Step-by-Step: How to make a Level 1 Alternate Appeal If you miss the deadline for contacting the Qual ity Improvement Organization, you can make an appeal to our plan, asking for a \"fast review.\" A fast review is an appeal that uses the fast deadlines instead of the standard deadlines. Here are the steps for a Le vel 1 Alternate Appeal: Legal Terms A \"fast review\" (or \"fast appeal\") is also called an \"expedited appeal .\" Step 1: Contact us and ask for a \"fast review.\" For details on how to contact us, go to the \"How to contact our plan's Member Services\" portion of the section called \"Important phone numbers and resources.\" Be sure to ask for a \"fast review .\" This means you are asking us to give you an answer using the \"fast\" deadlines ra ther than the \"standard\" deadlines. Step 2: We do a \"fast\" review of the decision we made about when to end coverage for your services. During this review, we take another look at all of the information about your case. We check to see if we were following all the rules when we set the date for ending the plan's coverage for services you were receiving. We will use the \"fast\" deadlines rather th an the standard deadlines for giving you the answer to this review. (Usua lly, if you make an appeal to our plan and ask for a \"fast review,\" we are allowed to decide whethe r to agree to your request and give you a 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) What to do if you have a problem or complain t (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 221 \"fast review.\" But in this s ituation, the rules requ ire us to give you a fast response if you ask for it.) Step 3: We give you our decision within 72 hours after you ask for a \"fast review\" (\"fast appeal\"). If we say yes to your fast appeal, it means we have agreed with you that you need services longer, and will keep providing your covered services for as long as it is medically necessary. It also means that we have agreed to reimburse you for our share of the costs of care you have received sin ce the date when we said your coverage would end. (You must pay your share of the costs and there may be coverage limitations that apply.) If we say no to your fast appeal, then your coverage will end on the date we told you and we will not pay any share of the costs after this date. If you continued to get home health care, skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabili tation Facility (CORF) services after the date when we said your coverage would end, then you will have to pay the full cost of this care yourself. Step 4: If we say no to your fast appeal, your case will automatically go on to the next level of the appeals process.

Instead, you need to use the pr ocess for coverage decisions and appeals. Go to the section on \"A guide to 'the basics' of coverage decisions and appeals.\" What kinds of problems are handled by the complaint process? This section explains how to use the process for making complaints. The complaint process is used for certain types of problems only.

Sometimes disputes or disagreements may arise betw een you (including your en rolled Family Members, heirs or personal representatives) and Health Net regarding the cons truction, interpretation, performance or breach of this Evidence of Coverage or regarding other matters rela ting to or arising out of your Health Net membership. Typically such disputes are handled and resolved through the Health Net Grievance, Appeal and Independent Medical Review process describe d above. However, in the event that a dispute is not resolved in that process, Heal th Net uses binding arbitra tion as the final method for resolving all such disputes, whether st ated in tort, contract or otherwise, and whethe r or not other parties such as employer groups, health care providers, or their agents or employees , are also involved. In addition, disputes with Health Net involving alleged professional liabil ity or medical malpractice (that is, whether any medical services rendered were unnecessary or unauthori zed or were improperly, negligently or incompetently rendered) also must be submitted to binding arbitration. As a condition to becoming a Health Net Member, you agree to submit all disputes you may have with Health Net, except those described below, to final a nd binding arbitration. Like wise, Health Net agrees to arbitrate all such disputes. This mutual agr eement to arbitrate disputes means that both you and Health Net are bound to use binding arbi tration as the final means of resolving disputes that may arise between the parties, and thereby the pa rties agree to forego the constitutional right to a jury trial on such disputes. However, no remedies that otherwise would be available to either party in a court of law will be forfeited by virtue of this ag reement to use and be bound by Health Net's binding arbitration process. This agreement to arbitrate shall be enforced even if a party to the arbitration is also involved in another action or proceeding with a third party arising out of the same matter. Health Net's binding arbitration pr ocess is conducted by mutually accep table arbitrator(s) selected by the parties. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, et seq., will govern arbitrations under this process. In the event that the total amount of damages claimed is $200,000 or le ss, the parties shall, within 30 days of submission of the demand for Arbitration to Health Net, appoint a mutually acceptable single neutral arbitrator who shall hear and decide the ca se and who will not have jurisdiction to award more than $200,000. In the event that the total amount of damages is over $200,000, the parties shall, within 30 days of submission of the demand for Arbitration to Health Net, appoint a mutually acceptable panel of three neutral arbitrators (unles s the parties mutually agree to one arbitrator), who shall hear and decide the case. If the parties fail to reach an agreement during this tim e frame, then either party may apply to a Court of Competent Jurisdiction for appointment of the ar bitrator(s) to hear a nd decide the matter. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Legal Notices 255 Arbitration can be initiated by subm itting a demand for Arbitration to He alth Net at the address provided below. The demand must have a clear statement of the facts, the relief so ught and a dollar amount. Health Net of California Attention: Litigation Administrator PO Box 4504 Woodland Hills, CA 91365-4505 The arbitrator is required to follow applicable state and federal laws. The arbitrator may interpret this Evidence of Coverage , but will not have any power to change, modify or refuse to enforce any of its terms, nor will the arbitrator have the authority to ma ke any award that would not be available in a court of law. At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrat or will issue a written opinion and award setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law and th e reasons for the award. The award will be final and binding on all parties except to the ex tent that applicable state or fede ral law provide for judicial review of arbitration proceedings. The parties will share equally the arbitrator's fees and expenses of administration involved in the arbitration. Each party also will be responsible fo r their own attorneys' fees. In cases of extreme hardship to a Member, Health Net may assume all or a portion of a Member's share of the fees and expenses of the Arbitration. Upon written notice by the Member requesting a hardship application, Health Net will forward the request to an independent professional dispute resolution organization for a determination. Such request for hardship should be submitted to the Litigation Administrator at the address provided above. Effective July 1, 2002, Members who are enrolled in an employer's plan that is subject to ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq., a federal law regulating benef it plans, are not required to submit disputes about certain \"adverse benefit determinations\" made by Health Net to mandatory binding arbitration. Under ERISA, an \"adverse benefit determination\" means a decision by Health Net to deny, reduce, terminate or not pay for all or a part of a benefit. However, you and Health Net may voluntarily agree to arbitrate disputes about these \"adverse benefit determ inations\" at the time the dispute arises. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Definitions of important words 256 DEFINITIONS OF IMPORTANT WORDS Ambulatory Surgical Center - An Ambulatory Surgical Center is an entity that operates exclusively for the purpose of furnishing outpatient surgical se rvices to patients not re quiring hospitalization and whose expected stay in the cen ter does not exceed 24 hours.

Balance Billing - When a provider (such as a doctor or hospit al) bills a patient more than the plan's allowed cost-sharing amount for services. As a member of our plan you only have to pay the plan's cost- sharing amounts when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow provi ders to \"balance bill\" or otherwise charge you more than the amount of cost sharing your plan says you must pay. Benefit Period - The way that both our plan and Original Medicare measure your use of hospital and skilled nursing facility (SNF) services. A benefit peri od begins the day you go in to a hospital or skilled nursing facility. The benefit period ends when you haven't received any inpa tient hospital care (or skilled care in a SNF) for 60 days in a row. If you go into a hospital or a skilled nursing f acility after one benefit period has ended, a new benefit period begins . There is no limit to the num ber of benefit periods. Brand Name Drug - A prescription drug that is manufactured and sold by the pharmaceutical company that originally researched and de veloped the drug. Brand name drugs have the same active-ingredient formula as the generic version of the drug. However, generic drugs are manufact ured and sold by other drug manufacturers and are generall y not available until after the pa tent on the brand name drug has expired. Catastrophic Coverage Stage - The stage in the Part D Drug Be nefit where you pay a low copayment or coinsurance for your drugs afte r you or other qualifie d parties on your behalf have spent $4,700 in covered drugs during the covered year.

See the \"Important phone numbers and resources\" sect ion of this booklet as it explains how to contact CMS.

Copayment - An amount you may be required to pay as you r share of the cost fo r a medical service or supply, like a doctor's visit, hospital outpatient visit, or a prescription drug. A copayment is usually a set amount, rather than a percentage. For example, you might pay $10 or $20 for a doctor's visit or prescription drug. Cost-sharing - Cost-sharing refers to amounts that a memb er has to pay when services or drugs are received. (This is in addition to any applicable plan monthly pr emium.) Cost sharing includes any combination of the following three types of paym ents: (1) any deductible amount a plan may impose before services or drugs are cove red; (2) any fixed \"copayment\" am ount that a plan requires when a specific service or drug is received; or (3) any \"co insurance\" amount, a percenta ge of the total amount paid for a service or drug, that a plan requires when a specific service or drug is received. A \"daily cost- sharing rate\" may apply when your doctor prescribes le ss than a full month's supp ly of certain drugs for you and you are required to pay a copay. Cost-Sharing Tier - Every drug on the list of covered drugs is in one of the different cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher the cost-sharing tier, the higher your cost for the drug. Coverage Determination - A decision about whether a Part D dr ug prescribed for you is covered by the plan and the amount, if any, you are required to pa y for the prescription. In general, if you bring your prescription to a pharmacy and the pharmacy tell s you the prescription isn' t covered under your plan, that isn't a coverage dete rmination. You need to call or write to your plan to ask for a formal decision about the coverage. Coverage determinations are cal led \"coverage decisions\" in this booklet. The \"What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, compla ints)\" section of this booklet explains how to ask us for a coverage decision.

Creditable Prescription Drug Coverage - Prescription drug coverage (fo r example, from an employer or union) that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Me dicare's standard prescription drug coverage. People who have this kind of coverage when they become eligible for Medicare can generally keep that coverage without paying a penalty, if they decide to enro ll in Medicare prescription drug coverage later. Custodial Care - Custodial care is persona l care provided in a nursing home , hospice, or other facility setting when you do not need skilled medical care or sk illed nursing care. Custodi al care is personal care that can be provided by people who don't have professiona l skills or training, such as help with activities of daily living like bathing, dressi ng, eating, getting in or out of a bed or chair, moving around, and using the bathroom.

Daily cost-sharing rate - A \"daily cost-sharing rate\" may apply when your doctor prescribes less than a full month's supply of certain drugs for you and you ar e required to pay a copay. A daily cost-sharing 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Definitions of important words 258 rate is the copay divided by the num ber of days in a month's supply. He re is an example: If your copay for a one-month supply of a drug is $30, and a one-month' s supply in your plan is 30 days, then your \"daily cost-sharing rate\" is $1 per day. This means you pay $1 for each day's supply when you fill your prescription. Deductible - The amount you must pay (if applicable) for health care or prescriptions before our plan begins to pay. Disenroll or Disenrollment - The process of ending your membership in our plan. Disenrollment may be voluntary (your own choice) or in voluntary (not your own choice).

Emergency - A medical emergency is when you, or any other prudent layperson with an average knowledge of health and medicine, believe that you have medical sy mptoms that require immediate medical attention to prevent loss of life, loss of a limb, or loss of function of a limb. The medical symptoms may be an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly getting worse. Emergency Care - Covered services that are: 1) rendered by a provider qualified to furnish emergency services; and 2) needed to treat, evaluate, or stabilize an emergency medical condition.

You may also request an exception if your plan sponsor requires you to try another drug before receiving the drug you are requesting, or the plan limits the quantity or dos age of the drug you are requesting (a formulary exception). \"Extra Help\" - A Medicare program to help people with limited income and resources pay Medicare prescription drug program costs, such as premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance. Generic Drug - A prescription drug that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as having the same active ingredient(s ) as the brand name drug. Generally, a \"generic drug\" works the same as a brand name drug and usually costs less. Ge neric drugs are generally not available until after the patent on the brand name drug has expired. Grievance - A type of complaint you make about us or one of our network provi ders or pharmacies, including a complaint concerning th e quality of your care. This type of complaint does not involve coverage or payment disputes. 2015 Evidence of Coverage for Health Net Seniority Plus (Employer HMO) Definitions of important words 259 Home Health Aide - A home health aide provid es services that don't need the skills of a licensed nurse or therapist, such as help with personal care (e.g., bath ing, using the toile t, dressing, or carrying out the prescribed exercises).

We, your plan, must provide you with a list of hospices in your geogr aphic area. If you elect hos pice and continue to pay premiums you are still a member of our plan.

For example, individuals with income greater than $85,000 and married couples with income greater than $170,000 must pay a higher Medicare Part B (medical insurance) and Medicare prescription drug coverage premium amount. This additional amount is called the income-related monthly adjustment amount. Less than 5 percent of people with Medicare are affected, so most people will not pay a higher premium. Initial Coverage Stage - This is the stage before your tota l drug costs including amounts you have paid and what your plan has paid on your behalf for the year have reached $2,960 . Initial Enrollment Period - When you are first eligible for Medicare, the period of time when you can sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B. For example, if you're eligible for Medicare when you turn 65, your Initial Enrollment Period is the 7-month period th at begins 3 months before the month you turn 65, includes the month you turn 65, and ends 3 months after the month you turn 65. Late Enrollment Penalty - An amount added to your monthly pr emium for Medicare drug coverage if you go without creditable coverage (cove rage that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as standard Medicare prescription drug c overage) for a continuous period of 63 days or more. You pay this higher amount as long as you have a Medicare drug plan. There are so me exceptions. For example, if you receive \"Extra Help\" from Medicare to pay your pr escription drug plan costs, you will not pay a late enrollment penalty.
