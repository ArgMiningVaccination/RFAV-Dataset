Directions for Use: ADMINISTER ORALLY Nettle (Urtica dioica) Nettles have been used for centuries as a cheap and wholesome health supplement, they make a great spring tonic, and can be used as a wash for rinsing horses manes and tails. When fed to horses they encourage lovely dappling on their coats. Young tender nettle leaves can also be used to make a cheap and very tasty soup. Don't worry, they lose their sting when you cook them! Remember to wear gloves when collecting the nettles to protect your hands, and use only the young tender leaves. Why not try making some soup, its great fun, the nettles are free and fantastically healthy.

I was so delighted to find this product, I'd searched everywhere for a product containing this specific mix of herbs but couldn't fidn one anywhere until I found this. I have used it on its own as a general supplement and also alongside other specific supplements to add diversity to my horse's diet, epseically at times of year when the hedgerow isn't so plentiful for foraging! Clearly very palatable and smells lovely - Chloe, 28/10/2022 we have been using herb Power on our 4 horses for over 10 years now and the mix of herbs compliment there natural lifestyle perfectly ..The Quality of herbs is excellent . - Mark Antcliff, 24/02/2020 My name is Monet Ward. I purchased Herb Power for my 3 year old colt. He stopped eating the Vitamins I have been giving him the past 3 years. I was worried what to give him and saw Hilton Herbs and thought I would give them a try. When I opened up the box and saw how real and amazing these herbs were. Then I smelled them and wanted to eat them myself. Well my young horse ate them up very quickly. Now I feed them to all my horses. Amazing product well worth your money - Monet Ward, 07/09/2018 Can't complain I took my mare off hard feed and wanted something to compliment her chaff. This has been perfect, she's not fizzy and I'm keeping her weight down. Her coat is also beautiful! - Naomi Biggin, 02/05/2018 ..my retired Endurance horse Montana, who is 28 years young! Thanks to Hilton Herbs!! He has grown \"gracefully old\" on these great herbal products... I feel Hilton Herbs and Alternative Therapies truly complement each other and work great for our Equine friends! - Anne-Marie Pinter - Anne-Marie Pinter, 29/11/2017 This site uses cookies.
