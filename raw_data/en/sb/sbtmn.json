Health care is a partnership of knowledge and the quest to understand the complexities of each individual while developing long-term strategies that achieve and maintain wellness. Please feel free to stop by our office located in tranquil Shell Beach. We look forward to assisting you on your path to better health. Our philosophy is \"one patient at a time\" providing comprehensive individualized care. A better understanding of the cause to one's dis-ease while knowing the different treatment options help empower patients. PNMC works in partnership with patients and other practitioners to develop comprehensive strategies for a patient to achieve wellness. We are results driven, which seems to be a simple strategy that is lost in our insurance-driven, disease management \"health\" care system. We work for our patients, NOT insurance companies. Whether you are suffering from the common cold or multiple complex chronic infectious diseases, PNMC is dedicated to your success. As our patient, we are dedicated to you as an extension of our family. The greatest gift we can provide is health and wellness with compassion and integrity, while our greatest feed back is a \"Thank You\" and referrals. PNMC has never advertised, we have built and continue to build through referrals from patients and other practitioners, for which we are extremely grateful. Thank you, Pacific Naturopathic Medical Center, Inc. I, Dr. Todd Thoring, graduated in 1999 from the well respected John Bastyr University in Seattle, Washington. I am currently licensed in my native State of California to practice primary care as a Naturopathic Doctor. Since 2002, I have been committed to the integrative treatment of tick born infections and chronic degenerative disease. This specialty was not intended yet rather brought about by a single patient with the diagnosis of chronic Lyme Disease which in turn prompted me to reevaluate and test many other patients revealing a much greater problem than I was taught. This eye-opening pivotal patient changed my practice forever, as well as made me realize how little I knew about this complex, elusive and devastating disease. I then decided to embrace this calling and learn as much as I could through ILADS, CALDA, patients, conferences and preceptorships with the leading Lyme disease experts. Over the last several years, it has been my goal to make a positive contribution to the community through incorporating experience, Naturopathic theory, research and traditional use of herbal medicine from around the world to produce sophisticated and reliable formulations. The most important thing I have learned is that we, doctors and patients, need all the help we can get while using the best medicine for each individual patient for a given period of time whether that medicine is natural or not. It is my belief that we need to be dynamic and attentive in our treatments, focusing on the patient as well as the disease. When it comes to treating patients with prescription antibiotics, it is only one piece of a greater comprehensive treatment plan. I believe that antibiotics will not be the treatment modality that will take patients to the finish line of healing, but rather their innate healing response supported by a strong immune, endocrine / hormone, and detoxification system. I am dedicated to the principles of Naturopathic medicine in my clinical practice and product formulations. General & Family Practice with emphasis on comprehensive individualized care focused on educating the patient related to their obstacles to good health and empowering them with the tools to heal that can last a lifetime. SPECIALTIES Tick Born Disease including viral, parasitic, mycoplasma, & fungal infections Immune support including Naturopathic & complimentary care for Oncology/cancer, autoimmune disease, & allergies Comprehensive detoxification to address environmental toxins, heavy metals & biological toxins including mold related illness Functional endocrinology using customized hormone replacement therapy & nutritional Gastrointestinal disorders & dysfunction Common skin conditions that include acne, rosacea & dermatitis Neurological & cognitive support Mood support for anxiety & depression Our evaluation uses the latest and progressive cutting edge laboratory testing as well radiographic imaging and specialist referrals as needed for diagnosis. Dr. Thoring takes a detailed comprehensive history along with physical exam to establish the foundation for diagnosis and initiate working diagnoses that are then supported through testing along while evaluation of clinical response to specific treatments. Dr. Thoring uses many modalities in his treatment plan that include, but not limited to: clinical nutrition/diet/lifestyle changes, botanical/herbal medicine, orthomolecular medicine/specific vitamin and mineral supplementation, complex homeopathy, and prescription medications. Choosing the appropriate treatment is centered on the patient, condition and timing. Dr. Thoring frequently refers to Erika Eddy for acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, cranial sacral therapy, Reiki and Tui Na to compliment his care and patient healing. Whether its a common cold or complex chronic disease, Dr. Thoring provides patient center care with multifaceted treatments. What to Expect Prior to your appointment we recommend you download the new patient paperwork and policies. Please read & complete prior to your appointment and bring to your appointment. Please bring in copies of previous lab results and relevant records. We recommend that patients with complex and extensive histories compile a chronology of symptoms along with specialists seen, testing, medications with response to those treatments and any other relevant history. Please write down questions and expectations to be reviewed with Dr. Thoring. Also those patients with chronic or complex conditions, we recommend you come in with a friend or family member to help with taking notes, asking questions and support! PNMC is committed to your success and are always working to help you with all aspects of your care. First visits can be 45-60 min for general practice care and establishing primary care. We also will accommodate new patients for acute appointments that may only require 30 min, such as upper respiratory infections or recent tick bites requiring immediate care with less complexity. Complex first visits can be 75 min to 2 hrs. Your first visit will include an extensive review of your history and medical records. We will answer your questions and provide information related to establishing a working diagnosis to initiate laboratory work and develop treatment strategies.

[Please see our Communication Policies.](http://pacificnmc.com/home/download-the-forms-you-need-by-clicking-the-links-below/) Follow up appointments can range from 30-60 min depending on how many labs have to be reviewed or whether we need to obtain more objective and subjective information (reformulating the treatment plan and answer questions). Brief follow up visits can be 15-30 min. for less complex conditions. I graduated from Los Angeles College of Chiropractic and the College of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine at Southern California University of Health Sciences. I received a Doctorate degree in Chiropractic and a Master's degree in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. Prior to this, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Mount Saint Mary's University in Los Angeles. I was born in the Bay Area and raised in Hawaii. After completing my studies, I moved back to the island of Oahu and had the opportunity to practice at a thriving clinic. I now reside on the Central Coast and am licensed as both an acupuncturist and chiropractor in California. My treatments are unique as I can perform both acupuncture and chiropractic therapy in one integrated session. I treat a wide variety of conditions, but specialize in pain management, women's health, fertility, stress management, headaches/migraines, sports injuries, and preventative care. As each individual's needs and symptoms may differ, my goal is to work together to spark the innate healing potential of the human body. I am passionate about helping patients of all ages restore or maintain balance using various methods. Treatments may include: acupuncture needling, electro-acupuncture stimulation, cupping, chiropractic adjustments, soft tissue therapy, herbal remedies and nutritional supplementation or counseling. I am also a certified Reiki Level III practitioner. This allows me to further harmonize the mind, body, and spirit. Outside the office, I love being a new mom to a beautiful baby boy, spending time with my husband and our family, hiking with our goldendoodle Lulu, and sparking joy in my life. Acupuncture is a component of traditional Chinese medicine that originated in China over 3,000 years ago. Although there are records of acupuncture being used hundreds of years ago in Europe, it was during the second half of the twentieth century that it began to spread more rapidly in Western Europe, the United States and Canada. In 1997, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) documented and publicized acupuncture's safety and efficacy for treating a wide range of conditions. According to WHO (World Health Organization) acupuncture is effective for treating at least 28 conditions, while evidence indicates it may have an effective therapeutic value for many more. How Acupuncture Works Acupuncture points are areas of designated electrical sensitivity. Very fine needles are inserted at these points to stimulate various sensory receptors that, in turn, stimulate nerves which transmit impulses to the hypothalamic-pituitary system at the base of the brain. The hypothalamus-pituitary glands are responsible for releasing neurotransmitters and endorphins, the body's natural pain-killing hormones. It is estimated that endorphins are 200 times more potent than morphine. Endorphins also play a big role in the functioning of the hormonal system. This is why acupuncture works well for back pain and arthritis and also for PMS and infertility. Some of the physiological effects observed throughout the body include increased circulation, decreased inflammation, relief from pain, relief of muscle spasms and increased T-cell count, providing stimulation to the immune system. Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on an ancient philosophy that describes the universe, and the body, in terms of two opposing forces: yin and yang. When these forces are in balance, the body is healthy. Energy, called \"qi\" (pronounced \"chee\") flows along specific pathways, called meridians, throughout the body. This constant flow of energy keeps the yin and yang forces balanced. However, if the flow of energy gets blocked, like water getting stuck behind a dam, the disruption can lead to pain, lack of function, or illness. Acupuncture therapy can release blocked qi in the body and stimulate function, evoking the body's natural healing response through various physiological systems. Modern research has demonstrated acupuncture's effects on the nervous system, endocrine and immune systems, cardiovascular system, and digestive system. By stimulating the body's various systems, acupuncture can help to resolve pain, and improve sleep, digestive function, and improve one's sense of well-being. A mom of two beautiful girls, we love spending time outdoors at the beach boogie boarding or enjoying a family picnic. Being in the medical field as a Medical Assistant for 8+ years, I feel blessed to be a part of this community. At PNMC, I love helping our patients and I am happy to be a part of a balanced office with people who truly care about each other and the care of the patients. I moved to the beautiful Central Coast 20 years ago and enjoy playing golf. I love helping with the smooth flow of the office and managing our extensive in-house natural pharmacy. I thoroughly enjoy being a part of an office and staff that shares the same principles of health and wellness. "}
