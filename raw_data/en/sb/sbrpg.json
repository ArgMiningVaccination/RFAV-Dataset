You are filing a \"post -service claim \" when you ask us to pay for or cover Services that have already been received. You must follow our procedure for filing claims, and we must follow certain rules established by ERISA for responding to claims. As a Member, you must receive all covered Services from Participating Providers and Participating Facilities, except as otherwise specifically permitted in this EOC. We will not directly or indirectly prohibit you from freely contracting at any time to obtain health care Services from Non -Participating Providers and Non -Participating Facilities outside the Plan.

Using Your Identification Card We provide each Member with a Company identification (ID) card that contains the Member health record number. Have your health record number available when you call for advice, make an appointment, or seek Services. We use your health record number to iden tify your medical records, for billing purposes and for membership information. You should always have the same health record number. If we ever inadvertently issue you more than one health record number, please let us know by calling Member Services . If you need to replace your ID card, please call Member Services . Your ID card is for identification only, and it does not entitle you to Services. To receive covered Services, you must be a current Member. Anyone who is not a Member will be billed as a non -member for any Services they receive.

SAMPLE EOSGDEDSTD0122 40 OM About Our Drug Formulary Our drug formulary is a list of drugs that our Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Com mittee has reviewed and approved for our Members and includes drugs covered under this EOC . Drugs on the formulary have been approved by the FDA . Our Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Committee is made up of Participating Physicians, other Participating Providers, and administrative staff. The committee chooses drugs for the formulary based on several factors, including safety and effectiveness as determined from a review of the scientific literature. They may not approve a drug if there is not enough sci entific evidence that it is clinically effective . They may also exclude a drug if it does not have a clinical or cost advantage over comparable formulary drugs. The Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Committee meets to review new drugs and reconsider drug s currently on the market. After this review, they may add drugs to the formulary or remove drugs from it. If a drug is removed from the formulary, you will need to switch to another comparable drug that is on the drug formulary, unless your old drug meets exception criteria. Refer to the \"Drug Formulary Exception Process\" in this \"Outpatient Prescription Drugs and Supplies\" section for more information. If a formulary change affects a prescription drug you are taking, we encourage you to discuss any questi ons or concerns with your Participating Provider or another member of your health care team. Drugs on our formulary may move to a different drug tier during the Year. For example, a drug could move from the Non -Preferred Brand -Name Drug list to the Preferr ed Brand -Name Drug list.

This exclusion does not apply to Services that are covered under \" Preventive Care Services \" in the \"Benefits\" section. REDUCTIONS Coordination of Benefits The Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision applies when a person has health care coverage under more than one Plan. Plan is defined below. The order of benefit determination rules govern s the order in which each Plan will pay a claim for benefits. The Plan that pays first is called the Primary Plan. The Primary Plan must pay benefits in accordance with its policy terms without regard to the possibility that anoth er Plan may cover some expenses. The Plan that pays after the Primary Plan is the Secondary Plan . The Secondary Plan may reduce the benefits it pays so that payments from all Plans do not exceed 100 percent of the total Allowable expense . Definitions A. A Pla n is any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical or dental care or treatment. If separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered parts of the same Plan and th ere is no COB among those separate contracts . (1) Plan includes: group and individual health insurance contracts, health maintenance organization (HMO) contracts, group or individual closed panel Plans , other forms of group or group -type coverage (whether insu red or uninsured); medical care components of group long -term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; Medicare or any other federal governmental Plan, as permitted by law ; SAMPLE EOSGDEDSTD0122 54 OM and group and individual insurance contracts and subscriber contracts that pay or reimburse for the cost of dental care . (2) Plan does not include: independent, non -coordinated hospital indemnity coverage or other fixed indemnity coverage; accident only coverage; specified disease or specified accident coverage; school accident type coverage; benefits for non -medical components of group long -term care policies; Medicare supplement policies; Medicaid policies; or coverage under other federal governmental Plans, unless permitted by law . Each contract for coverage under (1) or (2) is a s eparate Plan. If a Plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Plan. B. This Plan means, in a COB provision, the part of the contract providing the health care benefits to which the COB provision a pplies and which may be reduced because of the benefits of other Plans. Any other part of the contract providing health care benefits is separate from This Plan. A contract may apply one COB provision to certain benefits, such as dental benefits, coordinat ing only with similar benefits, and may apply another COB provision to coordinate other benefits . C. The order of benefit determination rules determine s whether This Plan is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan when the person has health care coverage under more than one Plan . When This Plan is primary, it determines payment for its benefits first before those of any other Plan without considering any other P lan's benefits. When This Plan is secondary, it determines its benefits after those of another Plan and may reduce the benefits it pays so that all Plan benefits do not exceed 100 percent of the total Allowable expense . D. Allowable expense is a health ca re expense, including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments, that is covered at least in part by any Plan covering the person. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of Services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an Allowab le expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not covered by any Plan covering the person is not an Allowable expense. In addition, any expense that a provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is prohibited from charging a covered p erson is not an Allowable expense . The following are examples of expenses that are not Allowable expenses : (1) The difference between the cost of a semi -private hospital room and a private hospital room is not an Allowable expense, unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private hospital room expenses . (2) If a person is covered by two or more Plans that compute their benefit payments on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology or other similar reimbur sement methodology, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specific benefit is not an Allowable expense . (3) If a person is covered by two or more Plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees is not an Allowable expense . (4) If a person is covered by one Plan that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology or othe r similar reimbursement methodology and another Plan that provides its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the Primary Plan's payment arrangement shall be the Allowable expense for all Plans. However, if the provider has contracted with t he Secondary Plan to provide the benefit or service for a specific negotiated fee or payment amount that is different than the Primary Plan's payment arrangement and if the provider's contract permits, the negotiated fee or payment shall be the Allowable e xpense used by the Secondary Plan to determine its benefits . (5) The amount of any benefit reduction by the Primary Plan because a covered person has failed to comply with the Plan provisions is not an Allowable expense. Examples of these types of Plan SAMPLE EOSGDEDSTD0122 55 OM provisions include second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions, and preferred provider arrangements . E. Closed panel Plan is a Plan that provides health care benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of services through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Plan, and that excludes coverage for services provided by other providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel member . F. Custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year excluding any temporary visitation . Order of Benefit Determination Rules When a person is covered by two or more Plans, the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are as follows : A. The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits of under any other Plan. B. (1) Except as provided in Paragraph (2), a Pl an that does not contain a coordination of benefits provision that is consistent with this regulation is always primary unless the provisions of both Plans state that the complying Plan is primary. (2) Coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits and provides that this supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. Examples of these types of situations are major medica l coverages that are superimposed over base plan hospital and surgical benefits, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a Closed panel Plan to provide out-of-network benefits. C. A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in calculating payment of its benefits only when it is secondary to that other Plan . D. Each Plan determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply : (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that c overs the person other than as a dependent, for example as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covers the person as a dependent is the Secondary Plan. However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a r esult of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the Plan covering the person as a dependent; and primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a dependent (e.g. a retired employee); then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so tha t the Plan covering the person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Secondary Plan and the other Plan is the Primary plan . (2) Dependent child covered under more than one Plan. Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a depen dent child is covered by more than one Plan the order of benefits is determined as follows : (a) For a dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married: (i) The Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the Primary Plan; or (ii) If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Plan . (b) For a dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married : SAMPLE EOSGDEDSTD0122 56 OM (i) If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of thos e terms, that Plan is primary. This rule applies to plan years commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree ; (ii) If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care cove rage, the provisions of subparagraph (a) above shall determine the order of benefits ; (iii) If a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care cover age of the dependent child, the provisions of subparagraph (a) above shall determine the order of benefits; or (iv) If there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of b enefits for the child are as follows : 1. The Plan covering the Custodial parent ; 2. The Plan covering the spouse of the Custodial parent ; 3. The Plan covering the non -custodial parent ; and then 4. The Plan covering the spouse of the non -custodial parent . (c) For a dep endent child covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the provisions of subparagraph (a) or (b) above shall determine the order of benefits as if those individuals were the parents of the child . (d) For a dependent child: (i) Who has coverage under either or both parents' plans and also has coverage as a dependent under a spouse's plan, the rule in paragraph (5) applies. (ii) In the event the dependent child's coverage under the spouse's plan began on the s ame date as the dependent child's coverage under either or both parents' plans, the order of benefits shall be determined by applying the birthday rule in subparagraph (a) to the dependent child's parent and the dependent's spouse. (3) Active employee or retired or laid -off employee. The Plan that covers a person as an active employee, that is, an employee who is neither laid -off nor retired, is the Primary Plan. The Plan covering that same person as a retired or laid -off employee is the Secondary Plan. The same would hold true if a person is a dependent of an active employee and that same person is a dependent of a retired or laid - off employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule labeled D(1) can determine the order of benefits . (4) COBRA or state continuation coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided pursuant to COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by state or other federal law is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree or covering the person as a dependent of an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan and th e COBRA or state or other federal continuation coverage is the Secondary Plan. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule labeled D (1) can determine the order of benefits . (5) Longer or shorter length of coverage. The Plan that covered the person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree longer is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covered the person the shorter period of time is the Secondary Plan . SAMPLE EOSGDEDSTD0122 57 OM (6) If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits, the Allowable expenses shall be shared equally between the Plans meeting the definition of Plan. In addition, This Plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the Primary Plan . Effect on the Benefits of This Plan A. When This Plan is secondary, it may reduce its benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans during a Plan year are not more than the total Allowable expenses. In determini ng the amount to be paid for any claim, the Secondary Plan will calculate the benefits it would have paid in the absence of other health care coverage and apply that calculated amount to any Allowable expense under its Plan that is unpaid by the Primary Pl an. The Secondary Plan may then reduce its payment by the amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the Primary Plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans for the claim do not exceed the total Allowable expense for that claim. In ad dition, the Secondary Plan shall credit to its Plan deductible any amounts it would have credited to its deductible in the absence of other health care coverage . B. If a covered person is enrolled in two or more Closed panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non -panel provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed panel Plan, COB shall not apply between that Plan and other Closed panel Plans . Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Certain facts about health ca re coverage and services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under This P lan and other Plans. We may get the facts we need from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying these rules and det ermining benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans covering the person claiming benefits. We need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under This Plan must give us any facts we need to apply those rul es and determine benefits payable. Facility of Payment A payment made under another Plan may include an amount that should have been paid under This Plan. If it does, it may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under This Plan. This Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. Right of Recovery If the amount of the payments made by This P lan is more than it should have paid under this COB provision, This Plan may recover the excess from one or more of the persons it has paid or for whom it has paid; or any other person or organization that may be responsible for the benefits or services provided for the covered person. The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. Questions About Coordination of Benefits? Contact Your State Insurance Department Hospitalization on Your Effective Date If you are an inpatient in a hospital on your membership effective date but had other Group coverage on the day before your membership effective date, your other Group coverage will be responsible for covering the Services you receive until you are released from the hospital, or until you have exhausted your benefit with the other Group coverage and the benefits available under this Plan will be reduced accordingly. SAMPLE EOSGDEDSTD0122 58 OM Injuries or Illnesses Alleged to be Caused by Other Parties This \"Injuries or Illnesses Alleged to be Caused by Other Parties\" section applies if you receive covered Services for an injury or illness alleged to be any of the following: Caused by another party's act or omission. Received on the premises of another party. Subject to applicable law, i f you obtain a settlement , award, or judgment from or on behalf of another party or insurer , you must ensure we are reimbursed for covered Services that you receive for the injury or illness, except that : for injuries caused by a motor vehicle accident, we will not collect to the extent that the payment would leave you less than fully compensated for your injury or illness; and for in juries or illnesses that are not caused by a motor vehicle accident, we will not collect more than the amount you receive from or on behalf of the other party. This \"Injuries or Illnesses Alleged to be Caused by Other Parties\" section does not affect your obligation to pay any applicable Cost Share for these covered Services. The amount of reimbursement due to the Plan is not limited by or subject to the Out -of-Pocket Maximum. If you do not recover anything from or on b ehalf of the other party, then you are responsible only for any applicable Cost Share . To the extent permitted by law, we have the option of becoming subrogated to all claims, causes of action, and other rights you may have against another party or an insu rer, government program, or other source of coverage for monetary damages, compensation, or indemnification on account of the injury or illness allegedly caused by another party.

To secure our rights, we will have a lien on the proceeds of any judgment , award, or settlement you or we (when we subrogate) obtain against another party, regardless of how those proceeds may be characterized or designated.

We may assign our rights to enforce our liens and other rights.
