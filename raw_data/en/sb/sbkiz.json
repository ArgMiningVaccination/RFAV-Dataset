Service Inc. (Ship to Shore) is currently operating a commercial waste treatment facility on Gloria McCluskey Drive in the Burnside Industrial Park in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia (see Figure 1). The facility, which currently treats international waste, is operating under an approval from the Nova Scotia Department of the Environment and Labour (NSEL) (Appendix A). The treatment method consists of sterilization of the waste in a hydroclave unit. Once treated, the residual solid waste is transported to an approved landfill for final disposal. Bio-Medical Waste Disposal Service Inc., an affiliate of Ship to Shore, wishes to expand the treatment process and capacity of the existing facility on Gloria McCluskey Drive to allow for treatment of biomedical waste from a number of facilities such as hospitals, dentist offices, and veterinary hospitals. Depending on the volume of waste to be treated, the facility may expand to the adjacent property in order to accommodate construction and operation of two additional hydroclave units. It is understood that biomedical waste is considered a waste dangerous good under the Dangerous Goods Management Regulations; therefore, Bio-Medica l Waste Disposal Service Inc. is required to register this project as a Class I Undertaking pur suant to the Environmental Assessment Regulations under the Nova Scotia Environment Act . 1.1 Proponent I dentification Bio-Medical Waste Disposal Services was first registered in 1990 and was recently incorporated to provide services to the medical community offe ring a safe and environmentally sound approach to the collection, treatment and subsequent transfer of biomedical wastes for appropriate disposal. The proponent has operated a number of waste related companies over the past fifteen years with a firm focus on safe waste handling processes with par ticular emphasis on environmental issues. In that time, they have been active in providing advice and solutions on regional waste management issues such as the unforeseen closure of a waste incineration facility which required immediate action, prompting the need for the development of short and long term solutions. The company has also had experience handling large scale emergency clean up oper ations including oil spills and the aftermath of a collision and loss of cargo between two container ve ssels in Halifax Harbour. None of the proponent's companies have ever been cited by the Halifax Regi onal Municipality (HRM), NSEL or the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for any environmental infrac tions nor have there ever been any Workers' Compensation claims arising from their operations.

Depending on the volume of waste to be treated, the existing waste treatment facility on Gloria McCluskey Drive, Dartmouth, NS, may be expanded by construction of a new building to house two additional hydroclave units. The Project will include the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of biomedical waste. Refrigeration facilities will also be installed and empl oyed to temporarily store waste, as appropriate, prior to treatment or transfer. In accordance with the Guideline for the Management of Biomedical Waste in Canada (CCME 1992), waste that is not appropriate for treatment at the facility in Dartmouth, such as 'red bag' (human tissues, organs, body parts), cytotoxic, and pharmaceutical waste, will be properly stored and transferred for disposal at the existing approved incineration facility in Moncton, New Brunswick. Additional project details are provided in the following sections. 2.2 Project Background International Disposal Services Inc. (IDS) was established in 1990 to meet the needs of waste removal and disposal, including biomedical waste, for vessels and aircraft frequenting the Port of Halifax and the Halifax International Airport. Since that time, the Company has diversified but has continued to research various methods of disposal for biomedical waste with a view toward developing an environmentally sound alternative to in cineration. After an in-depth investigation of various technologies used in other jurisdictions, it was determined that hydroclaving, or steam-sterilization, of biomedical waste was, in the proponent's opinion, the safest possible method and provided an effective, efficient and environmentally sound method of waste management. A sister company, Ship to Shore, utilizes the same technology in the existing waste treatment facility on Gloria McCluskey Drive. This facility treats international waste from ships and aircraft prior to disposal to eliminate potential pathogens such as animal diseases or insect pests that may be present in waste from other countries. The hydroclave technology was developed for the treatment of biomedical waste and is used successfully in other jurisdictions in Canada and the US. Appendix B contains correspondence from various hydroclave facility operators and regulatory agencies with information on the effectiveness of the technology. These include the facilities in the Ottawa and Kingston General Hospitals in Ontario, Hospital Sterilization Serv ices in Port Coquitlam, BC, and BioMed Recovery & Disposal in Aberdeen, Saskatchewan. The proponent has recently incorporated Bio-Medical Waste Disposal Services Inc. and proposes to expand the treatment process and capacity at the existing facility on Gloria McCluskey Drive to allow for treatment of biomedical waste from a number of fac ilities such as hospitals, dentist offices, seniors' homes, extended care facilities, veterinary hospitals, laboratories and mortuaries. Depending on the volume of waste to be treated ( i.e., if a large contract were awarded), the facility may expand to the \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 5 adjacent property in order to accommodate construc tion and operation of two additional hydroclave units. 2.3 Geographic Location The proposed location for the Project (Figure 1) is the existing facility at 93 Gloria McCluskey Drive in the Burnside Industrial Park in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. The location proposed for expansion is lot 937 on Gloria McCluskey Drive (PID 41028176). This lot is bounded on the west side by the property occupied by Ship to Shore. The north side of the lot is bounded by Gloria McCluskey Drive and to the south and east by undeveloped lots 940 and 936 at 111 Colford Avenue and 77 Gloria McCluskey, respectively. Adjacent to the established roadway the lot is partia lly occupied by a small grove of birch trees. A small rock fill ridge intersects the front third of the lot. The back of the lot slopes down and to the south. Most of the lot comprises fill that was placed during development of the industrial park. The nearest occupied and active properties include the BFS Burnside Fleet Services Inc. and the Nova Scotia Correctional Institute, both located on Gloria McCluskey Drive. Other neighbours in the immediate area include the Miller Waste Composting Facility, Miller Tires, Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline Pressure Reduction and Odour Injection Station and the CAT Store. 2.4 Project Components 2.4.1 Equipment and Infrastructure The primary components required to carry out the wo rk include the H-65 hydroclave, steam producing boiler, condensation unit, conveyors and shredder/compac tor unit in operation at the existing facility in Burnside. For the proposed expansion, a 15 m by 30 m building will be erected to house the following: a boiler, two H-200 hydroclaves, condensation units, loading platforms, conveyor belts, waste shredder/compactors and waste bin, and control panels. Two steam condensers, sized to fully conden se all vented steam from the hydroclave with 2 - 16 \u00b0C municipal water, will be installed in the expansion facility. All steam water and vent lines will be fitted with electrically or pneumatically driven valves operated by the control system. To allow the existing facility to treat biomedical waste, the following equipment will be installed: scanning, tracking and computer software (see below), a refrigerated storage area for temporary storage of waste to be transferred for incineration, and a security fence around the property. Waste bins will be required to contain wastes prior to treatment, for temporary storage on site, and for transfer of wastes to appropriate disposal facilities. A back-up power supply ( i.e., generator) will also be installed. A computerized tracking system capable of scanning, weighing and tracking waste will also be installed in the facility and will include the computer, a bar code label printer for waste containers, customized proprietary tracking software, electronic weighing scale and accounting software. The new building will include a separate 4.2 x 4.2 m room for the boiler and a 3.6 x 5.5 m refrigerated storage room with the capacity to contain 18 tonnes or approximately 3 or 4 days worth of waste. In accordance with CCME guidelines, anatomical waste will be stored at 4 \u00b0C (or lower) as will all biomedical waste to be stored for more than 4 days. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 6 As the Project includes collection and transportation of waste to and from the facility, a variety of trucks will also be required to collect and transport the waste to the facility for treatment and to transport treated waste to an approved landfill for disposal. The transfer of waste that is not appropriate for treatment at the Dartmouth facility ( i.e., red bag waste, cytotoxics and pharmaceuticals) to the incineration facility in Moncton, New Brunswick will be undertaken by Mr. Shredding Waste Management Ltd., owner and operator of an approved incineration facility. The incineration facility has all of the required federal and provincial permits and approvals for operation of the facility for the treatment of bio-medical waste (including cytotoxics and pharmaceuticals) as well as for treating waste originating from outside the province (Appendix C). Further, the incineration facility has the appropriate permits and approvals to transport waste within and outside of the province of New Brunswick (Appendix C). Containment and vehicle specific requirements are determined by the federal Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations and re lated provincial regulations as summarized in Section 3.2. 2.4.2 Waste Description Sources of waste to be treated at the facility are varied and may include provincial and private facilities. Large quantities of waste may be generated by hospitals, laboratories and clinics, and teaching facilities for human and animal medicine. Smaller quantities may be generated by private care facilities such as seniors' homes and extended care facilities, dental offices, veterinary offices and hospitals, private laboratories and mortuaries. The types of waste proposed for treatment are described in this section. The Canadian Council of Ministers on the Environment (CCME 1992) defines biomedical waste as \"waste that is generated by human or animal health care facilities, medical or veterinary research and training establishments, health care teaching establishments, clinical testing or research laboratories, and facilities involved in the production or testing of vaccines.\" Further detail of individual waste types described by CCME is provided below. Wastes received from facilities under the direction of the Nova Scotia Department of Health are sorted and categorized as 'red bag' and 'yellow bag' waste as indicated below, where applicable, and may include the following (NSDH 2005) wastes defined by the CCME guideline: \u0083 Human Anatomical Waste consisting of human tissues, organs and body parts excluding hair and teeth (red bag); \u0083 Microbiology Laboratory Waste consisting of laboratory cultures, stocks or specimens of microorganisms, live or attenuated vaccines, human or animal cell cultures and laboratory material that may have come in contact with any of these (yellow bag); \u0083 Human Blood and Body Fluid Waste consisting of human fluid blood and blood products (excluding urine or feces), items saturated or dripping with blood, body fluids contaminated with blood, and body fluids removed for diagnosis during surgery, treatment or autopsy. This does not include urine or feces (yellow bag); and \u0083 Waste Sharps consisting of clinical and laboratory materials including needles, syringes, blades or laboratory glass (rigid container (yellow)). \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 7 While not defined as biomedical waste by the CCME guideline, the following types of waste may accompany the above noted wastes for treatment and disposal: \u0083 Cytotoxic Waste may consist of cytotoxics which are hazardous pharmaceuticals used in patient treatment or diagnosis. This commonly refers to pharmaceuticals used to treat cancer (red bag); \u0083 Pharmaceutical Waste including expired or non-useable medications (excluding cytotoxics and narcotics); and \u0083 Miscellaneous Waste (Non Hazardous) which may be inadvertently mixed in with biomedical wastes. This may consist of soiled dressings, sponges, surgery drapes, lavage tubes, casts, catheters, disposable pads, disposable gloves, specimen containers, lab coats and aprons, dialysis wastes such as tubing, tubing filters towels and disposable sheets. Other miscellaneous waste may include paper towels, coffee cups, packaging and other organic and inorganic waste which has inadvertently moved into the hazardous waste st ream, and cannot be separated out after exposure to biomedical waste (yellow bag). Waste from private facilities such as extended care facilities, dentist offices and laboratories are expected to contain similar components. Waste from animal hospitals may contain similar components (sharps, gloves, microbiology waste etc.) as well as animal waste which is defined as waste consisting of all animal tissues, organs, body parts, carca sses, bedding, fluid blood and blood products, items saturated or dripping with blood, body fluids contaminated with blood, and body fluids removed for diagnosis or removed during surgery, treatment, or autopsy, unless a trained person has certified that the waste does not contain viruses and agents as specified in the CCME Guidelines (CCME 1992). This excludes teeth, hair, nails hooves and feathers (orange bag/container). The existing waste treatment facility on Gloria McCluskey Drive treats waste from the Port of Halifax and the Halifax International Airport. These wastes include food and assorted wastes which may include pathogens and/or insect pests not indigenous to the region. NSEL has categorized this waste as non hazardous. In accordance with the CCME guideline (1992), \"Biomedical waste does not include waste that is: \u0083 From animal husbandry; \u0083 Household in origin; \u0083 Controlled in accordance with the Health of Animals Act (Canada); or \u0083 Generated in the food production, general building maintenance and office administration activities of those facilities to which the definition applies.\" The facility will not accept or process illegal drugs seized as part of a police investigation. 2.5 Waste Treatment Process The hydroclave technology was developed in Canada fo r the treatment of biomedical waste through a grant from the National Research Council. The technology was first tested at the Kingston General Hospital (KGH) in 1995. The University of O ttawa served as an independent testing facility. The technology is able to achieve an inactivation of a microbial load of greater than log 6 equivalent of Bacillus stearothermophilus (Springthorpe & Sattar, 1995) , the desired level of sterilization. The technology does not treat other parameters such as elevated metals. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 8 The waste treatment process begins at the waste generating facilities with primary waste sorting prior to collection. At provincial medical facilities the waste is sorted and bagged in coloured bags or containers ( e.g. red bag, yellow bag) to separate biomedical waste types. Other facilities will sort waste in a similar fashion. Waste is collected from the facilities as needed or by predetermined schedule, using the appropriately sized and equipped vehicle ( e.g., trucks with refrigerated compartments). Upon arrival at the facility on Gloria McCluskey Drive, waste will be weighed. Information will be recorded and entered into a computer waste management data program designed for the Project. Waste will be removed from the storage containers and bags deposited in the hydroclave for treatment. Each hydroclave unit will have two top loading doors. A raised loading platform at the level of the loading door will be installed to eliminate unnecessary handling of the waste while discharge conveyors will be installed for each hydroclave unit to carry the treated waste to the central shredding unit and receiving container. The hydroclave is a double walled, cylindrical vessel with the inner wall of the vessel providing containment for the waste and the outer wall (or jacket) forming a steam chamber surrounding the inner vessel (Figure 2). In the inner chamber, the waste is mixed by rotators which break it into small pieces. Steam then fills the outer chamber, heating the inner vessel and vaporizing the liquids in the waste. The heat from the steam raises the temperature inside the vessel and causes the liquids in the waste to vaporize. The pressure in the inner chamber is raised to a specified level. The combination of pressure, high temperature and steam result in the sterilization of the waste. When moisture content in the inner chamber is determined to be below desired levels to produce the steam necessary for sterilization, steam from the boiler is automatically added to the load. FIGURE 2 Hydroclave Schematic The operating temperature and pressure of the hydroclave are specific to the level of sterility to be achieved. Treatment temperatures may range from 121 C - 140 C with vessel pressure ranging from 103.4 to 206.84 kPa and treatment cycles varying from 15 to 30 minutes. To ensure adequate treatment of waste, it is proposed that, during commissioning of the facility and for a period of 30 consecutive days of successful operation ( i.e., 30 days of successful treatment results), each load be tested with live spore test strips ( i.e., 12.92 Rapid B.I. Steam). In the event testing indicates inadequate \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 9 or unsuccessful treatment, the load will be reprocessed. After 30 days of successful operation, it is proposed that the frequency of confirmatory testing be adjusted to once daily ( i.e., the first treated load each day). In the event testing indicated inadequat e treatment, all waste processed between since the last successful test will be reprocessed. The proponent will ensure that only waste that is adequately treated will be disposed of at an approved landfill facility. The vent is opened to depressurize the hydroclave through a condenser unit and mixing continues in the heated vessel until the waste is dry, reducing the volume by as much as 40%, depending upon the liquid content of the waste. Overall, the reduction in waste volume can be as much as 75-80%, including shredding and compaction. When the waste is ready to be removed from the hydroclave, the mixer rotates in the opposite direction pushing the dry, sterile waste out the loading door to the conveyor leading to the shredder. The waste is further fragmented in the shredder/compactor. Shredding of the waste not only reduces the volume, it minimizes the potential for injuries or exposure to employees. The waste bin is detached from the compactor and is transported to an approved disposal facility ( i.e., second generation landfill). Total processing time is approximately 90 minutes and includes loading and unloading of the hydroclave, depressurization, and shredding and compaction. The process is further illustrated in Figure 3. FIGURE 3 Process Flow Diagram \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 10 The internal material loading capacity of the H-65 hydroclave unit is 1.9 m3 with a treatment capacity of approximately 230 kg/hr. The internal material loadi ng capacity of the H-200 is approximately 5.7 m3 with a treatment capacity of 680 kg/hr. Processing times will vary with different loads as there will be variability in waste composition and moisture. Waste which is not appropriate for treatment in the hydroclave, specifically the red bag waste, cytotoxics and pharmaceuticals, will be temporarily and properly stored at the facility and subsequently transferred to the approved incineration facility in Moncton, New Brunswick. 2.6 Site Preparation/Construction Activities To prepare the existing facility for treatment of biom edical waste, a security fence would be erected around the property to ensure controlled access to the facility. A refrigeration unit and area will also be added as well as the waste scanning, tracking, and computer software package. Should an expansion be required to accommodate treatment of biomedical waste, some construction would be required at the site. The lot proposed for occ upation by the expansion facilities is immediately adjacent to the existing facility. This site would have to be cleared of a small grove of birch trees which currently occupies the street front of the lot (Figur e 4). If possible, clearing will be undertaken to avoid sensitive periods for most breeding birds ( i.e., outside of the mid-April to early August breeding season). If clearing during this sensitive period is necessary, a qualified biologist will conduct a survey of the site prior to clearing to identify and breeding or nesting activity. The Proponent will avoid disturbance of such activity to ensure compliance with the Migratory Bird Convention Act . FIGURE 4 Proposed Expansion Site \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 11 Construction related activities will include filling, compaction and grading to level the lot. Some minor trenching/excavation may be required to accommodate lines for water and sewer and natural gas, and to provide for installation of the building foundation and footings. The building to house the two new hydroclave units and associated equipment will be constructed as a Tilt-Up structure approximately 15 m x 30 m in size. This type of building reduces the amount of work required on site as the exterior walls and roofing system are cast and formed off site and are shipped to the location ready for installation by the time the foundation and slab are completed. In accordance with best practices and standard NSEL requirements, erosion and sedimentation controls will be in place to ensure that runoff generated during site construction is managed appropriately. This will include diversion of clean surface drainage away from disturbed areas, coordination of construction activities with seasonal constraints, to the extent possible, and minimization of the amount and duration of exposure of erodible soil at all times. Site drainage and surface runoff collection and controls will be in place prior to the commencement of construction of the expansion facility. Upon completion of construction, the site will be landscaped, minimizing the potential for sediment-laden runoff during operations. 2.7 Operations and Maintenance Operation of the biomedical waste treatment and transfer facility includes the following activities: \u0083 collection of waste from various facilities; \u0083 installation of a bar code label on all waste ( i.e., all waste that will be treated and all waste that will be subsequently transferred to the incineration facility) to ensure only waste that is appropriate for treatment is processed at the facility; \u0083 transport of the waste to the treatment facility on Gloria McCluskey Drive; \u0083 weighing, scanning and recording of the waste; \u0083 treatment (as described above) and/or temporary storage of the waste until it is treated or transferred for incineration; \u0083 transport of the treated waste to an approved landfill facility and transport of the red bag waste and other waste that is not approved for this method of treatment to the incineration facility in Moncton, New Brunswick; and \u0083 facility maintenance and repairs. 2.7.1 Facility Operations Upon obtaining all required approvals (and amendments) for the treatment and transfer of biomedical waste, and the successful negotiations between the Proponent and various biomedical waste generating facilities, as well as a few facility upgrades, as described above, the existing facility will begin the process for the collection and treatment of biomedical waste. The treatment of biomedical waste at the existing facility may occur on an 8-10 hour rotation or a 3-4 day rotation. That is, international waste will be treated for a period of 8-10 hours or 3-4 days (depending on the volumes of the various waste types to be treated) then biomedical waste will be treated. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 12 Expansion of the facility will not begin until such time as the volume of waste to be treated is increased such that the expansion is warranted and economically feasible. Once the facility is expanded, it is anticipated that the treatment of international waste will be undertaken at the existing facility while the treatment of biomedical waste will move to the expanded facility. The existing facility operates in accordance with an operations manual prepared for the hydroclave system/technology and modified for the facility. The manual will be further modified and updated, as appropriate, for the expanded facility. The operations manual contains information and detail related to waste collection, transportation, receiving and stor age as well as the treatment process, safety regulations and policies, emergency response procedur es, environmental monitoring, risk management and record keeping. 2.7.2 Waste Collection and Storage Waste will be collected from the various waste generating facilities on a regular basis according to an established schedule, or on an as needed basis depending upon the volume of waste to be collected and agreements in place with waste generators. The estimated number of trucks hauling waste to and from the facility is not known at this time as it will depend on the number and types of facilities who will us e this facility for their waste collection and treatment. In any case, the number of trucks will be sma ll relative to other local traffic. If a large contract were awarded, as many as 5 tru cks per day could be transporting wa ste to the facility. The approximate capacity for each truck is 2500 ft3 (71 m3). Given that waste could potentially be gathered from all across the province, it is difficult to clearly identify specific trucking routes. The location of the facility within the Burnside Industrial Park is easily accessed from several provincial highways ( i.e., Highway 107, Highway 118 and 111, and Highway 101 and 102). Within the Park, truck traffic will likely be limited to Burnside Drive, Akerley Boulevard, and Gloria McCluskey Drive. Transportation of waste from the waste generating facilities to the treatment facility is regulated federally through the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act and provincially through the Dangerous Goods Transportation Act . The Proponent will comply with all applicable legislation and will acquire necessary permits related to transportation of waste to the facility. The facility in Moncton, Mr. Shredding Waste Management, has all the appropriate approvals for transporting waste from Nova Scotia into New Brunswick (Appendix C). The biomedical waste will be received inside the building at the facility in a designated area. The waste will either be treated immediately or temporarily stored in accordance with CCME Guidelines (CCME 1992) and the operations manual. Prior to treatment or storage, the waste will be weighed, scanned and sorted (which will ensure only waste approved for treatment is processed) and the information will be entered into the waste data management system. A bar code system included with the tracking system will produce bar code labels to be scanned to ensure that waste types are properly coded and verified prior treatment, minimizing potential errors in waste identification. The bar code information will include waste category, name and location of the waste generator and identification number, method of treatment, waste receiver information, weight of waste and date of treatment and/or shipment. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 13 Treated waste will be stored in large containers, separate from untreated waste. Furthermore, international waste will be stored separately from biomedical waste. Red bag waste and cytotoxic and pharmaceutical waste will be stored in a refrigerated area, away from all other waste, and in accordance with CCME Guidelines. 2.7.3 Waste Volumes The existing facility treats approximately 800 tonnes of international waste annually by Ship to Shore. Treated waste is transported to the Otter Lake Landfill facility. The proposed expanded facility will have the capacity to treat approximately 3,500 tonnes of biomedical waste annually. This could include approximately 2,300 tonnes of waste from the public sector and another 1,200 tonnes of waste from various private sector facilities. 2.7.4 Maintenance Activities In accordance with standard maintenance practices, the equipment will undergo a full maintenance check ( i.e., oil changes) and cleaning on a monthly basis. Other minor maintenance activities are undertaken daily ( i.e., check of oil and grease levels in gear box, seal gaskets) and bi-weekly activities (i.e., top up oil on gear box, cleaning of gaskets). To minimize the duration of waste storage, the proponent will ensure that, prior to the scheduled maintenance, all stored waste is treated. 2.7.5 Project Employment It is anticipated that the Project will generate the following employment: \u0083 management and administration staff (3-4); \u0083 health and Safety Officer (1); \u0083 facility Operators (3-4); and \u0083 waste collection and delivery (8) All personnel working in the transportation, receiving, and processing areas of the facility will be properly trained for their respective roles ( e.g., TDG training for collection and delivery personnel). Training will include WHIMIS, safety and accident prevention procedures and all personnel will wear personal protective equipment as required. Additional in formation related to health as safety is provided in Section 2.10. 2.8 Emissions and Discharges Emissions and discharges associated with the propos ed waste treatment process include liquid, gaseous and solid wastes. Specifically these include: \u0083 sterile condensate from the steam/vapour generated from the waste; \u0083 wash from the container/bin washing and decontamination process; \u0083 vapour, which may include some VOCs, that may be released from the hood vent or when the hydroclave door is opened; \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 14 \u0083 residual solid waste which is (and will be) transported for disposal at an approved landfill facility; and \u0083 general domestic/office waste. 2.8.1 Liquid Waste A small amount of liquid waste will be generated by the treatment process. The liquid waste is made up of the moisture content of the waste as well as any liquids that may be present in the waste that have been sterilized. Generally, the volume of liquid wast e per load will be in the range of approximately 500 ml. In tests conducted on liquid effluent from a hydroclave operating in a hospital (MacLellan Water Technology, 2001), analysis indicated that formaldehyde, styrene and toluene were present in detectable concentrations. The latter two are likely attributable to the presence of plastics commonly found in the waste, and the former likely attributable to disinfectant materials in use at the hospital. The existing facility in Burnside has been treating internat ional waste. It is expected that liquid effluent from this treatment process would not be representative of the liquid effluent from the treatment of biomedical waste. A sampling port is located downstream of the condenser unit to allow for testing of effluent. Further, the current facility is equipped with two underground storage tanks with an approximate volume of 10,000 litres. The tanks have been installed for the collection (and possible treatment) of liquid waste prior to discharge. The proponent intends to discharge the liquid effluent generated from the process to the municipal sanitary sewer system. Bio-Medical Waste Disposal Services Inc. will work with HRM and NSEL to establish and confirm the suitability of the effluent for discharge into the municipal system and will develop an appropriate monitoring and reportin g program in consultation with HRM and NSEL. Unless otherwise specified by HRM or NSEL, monitoring will be undertaken for parameters identified in HRM Bylaw W101. Alternatives to discharge to the municipal system include incorporating the sterile liquid with the dry, shredded and compacted waste for disposal at the landfill or storage of liquid effluent in the holding tanks and subsequent removal and disposal by a qualified contractor to an approved facility. The hydroclave units, conveyors and shredder will be situated in a dyked area to contain any potential spills. A drain leading to the underground holding tanks will facilitate wash down and disinfection of the area. The holding tanks will be equipped with a sump pump to redirect any liquid resulting from a spill or leak and or any liquids resulting from wash down back into the hydroclave for treatment, as required, prior to release or disposal. Backflow preventers are in place at the existing facility on the hydroclave and boiler and will be in place at the expansion facility as well. A separate area of the building will be dedicated to washing and disinfection stations for the emptied waste bins. The area will be equipped with a large conveyor for washing and drying, as well as large steel tanks of disinfectant solution to receive the bins immediately after the contents are loaded into the hydroclave units. The wash station will consist of a 500 gallon tank equipped with automatic sodium hypochlorite injection to a maximum level of 150 ppm. The tank will require draining and replenishing once per week. It is intended that the tank contents be discharged to the municipal sanitary sewer system. As indicated above, the proponent will work with HRM and NSEL to ensure suitability of the liquid waste for discharge into the municipal system and will develop an appropriate monitoring and reporting program in consultation with HRM and N SEL. Unless otherwise specified by HRM or NSEL, monitoring will be undertaken for parameters identified in HRM Bylaw W101. Alternatives to discharge \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 15 to the municipal system include incorporating the sterile liquid with the dry, shredded and compacted waste for disposal at the landfill or storage of liquid effluent in the holding tanks and subsequent removal and disposal by a qualified contractor to an approved facility. 2.8.2 Air Emissions Emission testing has not been conducted on the existing plant. Due of the nature of the process, the emission gases are only those contained within the hydroclave upon opening, and it is not possible to apply conventional source testing processes (Canadian federal protocol is for steady state emissions). This is a distinct advantage of this technology. Testing will be carried out during commissioning to confirm that the scrubber system adequately captures the releases on opening of the system. These tests will focus on the volatile organic compounds before and after the air scrubber. Early tests conducted on VOC emissions from a hydroclave operating in a hospital (A.Lanfranco and Associates Inc., 1998) indicated that some compounds, in particular, carbon disulphide, benzene, styrene and vinylidene chloride were present in c oncentrations above Occupational Exposure Limits (OEL) at the post condenser exhaust, which was vented outside. Analysis of the same parameters at the hydroclave unloading door indicated that these compounds were well below OEL. It is noted that the use of carbon filters (not used in the above-noted project) significantly reduces air emissions should these be identified as a concern. The proposed facility will include carbon filters. The most representative test of atmospheric emissions was conducted in triplicate over a 40 minute period on the stack from a hydroclave operating at Hosp ital Sterilization Services of Port Coquitlam, BC (A. LanFranco, 2002). These tests indicated that no significant organic emissions were present in exhaust samples analyzed for chlorinated/brominated substances and volatile organic compounds, including mostly aliphatic hydrocarbons. With respect to potential emissions of odour compounds, the proposed process dries the waste during processing reducing potential for odours. To date, there have been no complaints regarding noise, odours or other emissions from the existing facility employing this technology. The technology available to address potential odours includes the installation of condensation units, HEPA filters, scrubbers and the use of additive treatments. For example, t he current international waste operation employs an autoclave deodorizer in gelatine capsule form to further reduce potential for odours in the hydroclave. Other air emissions associated with t he Project include vehicle emissions ( i.e., CO 2, SO 2, NO X) and dust. Waste delivery vehicles will be kept in good working order to maintain the positive company image. As part of the extensive training program for the drivers, they will be instructed on the ways in which environmental impacts may be minimized. This will include driving styles and behaviours, including the strict enforcement of no-idling policies. Upon arrival at the facility, all waste transport vehicles will back up to the loading/unloading bay and turn off the engine prior to opening the bay door. This will minimize vehicle exhaust from entering the work area. The impact of the vehicle emissions on the environment will not be significant. Minor dust emissions may result from construction activities. Water sprays will be used to control fugitive dust emissions. No dust emissions will result from the operation. The parking lot is paved, as are all access roads. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 16 2.8.3 Solid Wastes Following treatment in the hydroclave, solid wast es will be further fragmented and compacted by a shredder/compactor into a waste bin and transported to an approved second generation landfill for disposal. For the existing operation, treated waste is transported to the Otter Lake Waste Management Facility. In all other jurisdictions in Canada in which this technology is employed for the treatment of biomedical waste, residual wastes are disposed of at a landfill facility. The proponent is negotiating with several of the approved second generation landfill operators in the province regarding the acceptability of the treated waste (i.e., treated yellow bag waste). As part of the approval/amendment under Part V of the Environment Act , an approved facility for the disposal of the residual solid waste will be identified. Domestic and solid waste will be sorted for recycling on-site prior to disposal at an approved facility. Construction waste and debris will be managed by the construction contractor. Waste will be appropriately reused, recycled or disposed of at an appropriate and approved disposal facility. Given the type of building to be constructed (i.e., tilt -up structure), less construction waste is generated. Maintenance of construction equipment and vehicles used for the transport of waste will be conducted off-site at a licensed facility. 2.8.4 Hazardous Materials and Contingency Planning Other than the biomedical waste to be treated, the presence or use of hazardous materials on site will be limited and may include cleaning solutions for the waste bins and the hydroclave unit(s). The current facility uses natural gas from the local gas distribution system, eliminating the need for on site storage of petroleum products. Contingency plans are in place for the current operation and form part of the facilities operations and maintenance manual. As part of the application for amendments under Part V of the Environment Act , the proponent shall prepare additional plans to address issues associated with the treatment and transfer of biomedical waste. Plans will be developed in accordance with the provincial regulations and federal Transportation of Dangerous Goods regulations. The contingency plan will include, at a minimum, provision for training for all staff, as well as definition and dissemination of a reporting protocol to ensure rapid and accurate reporting of accidents to the appropriate authorities. The reporting system will address: a) what is to be repor ted and with what urgency; b) who is responsible for reporting; and c) to whom the incident is repor ted. Procedures will also address notification of municipal and provincial authorities where circum stances warrant; response procedures which will include chain of command notification; designated re sponsibilities; and location of equipment. The response plan will provide procedures for emergency response and post-emergency clean up. The local fire department will be invited to a briefing session and tour of the facility, so they may have an understanding of the procedures and plant operations in case of an emergency. With regards to transportation of waste, the plan may include but is not limited to a transportation protocol to be referenced including specific routing information, details of requisite safety, personal protective and load restraint equipment to be maintained in collection and transport vehicles at all times. Contingency plans are required for any business t hat relies on mechanical processing equipment. With any large mechanical processing plant it is expect ed that such a facility may from time to time experience operational disruptions. To this end, the proponent has developed a contingency plan to address any foreseeable circumstances with respect to maintenance and repair. For example, the \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 17 expanded facility will incorporate duplicate equipment su ch as two hydroclaves, two shredding units and two condensation units. Contingency measures for the installation of a portable boiler are in place, in the event of boiler malfunction. A natural gas fired generator will be on-site to ensure continued operation in the event of a power failure. A rrangements have been made to have a back-up portable generator on-site within one hour in the event of a malfunction of the on-site generator. During facility shutdown, untreated waste will be stored in the refrigeration room until the facility is up and running again. The refrigerated storage area will be capable of accommodating approximately 18 tonnes of biomedical waste, or three to four days of waste collected. The refrigeration area can store all waste until such time that Bio-Medical Waste Disposal Services and/or Ship to Shore Disposal Services are operational again. Facility shutdown will not impose an interruption in collection service to health- care facilities, and treatment will resume immediately upon recommencement of operations. If, for any reason, either of the above contingency plans cannot be executed, waste can be transported to the approved incinerator in Moncton, New Brunswick for treatment and disposal until such time as the equipment is repaired. In the event the facility in Moncton experiences a disruption in service, waste can be stored at the Moncton facility or transferred to the approved biomedical waste incinerator at the Dr. Everett Chalmers Hospital in Fredericton, New Brunswick ( i.e., the approved contingency/back-up for the Moncton facility). 2.9 Health and Safety Occupational Health and Safety is a key component of any workplace; the goal is to afford adequate protection to workers. Bio-Medical Waste Disposal Services Inc. is committed to ensuring the health safety of their employees and the public in all aspec ts of their operations through implementation of safe work procedures, exposure control plans and emergency procedures developed by the owners of the technology which are part of the facilities operations and maintenance manual. Upon approval of the EA, the manual will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the Nova Scotia Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations and conformance with the CCME Guidelines for the Management of Biomedical Waste in Canada. Equipment in place at the facility such as the conveyors helps to minimize waste handling by plant employees. A separate area of the building will be allo cated for personal requirements of facility staff such as a rest area and lunch room, washrooms complete with showers, storage lockers, and change rooms. These areas of the facility will be separated fr om the waste treatment area by two doors, with receptacles for soiled and/or disposable clothing or equipment placed between the two to minimize potential for cross contamination. Employees will be hired in advance of the commenc ement of operations to ensure adequate time is allocated for training. Staff to be trained includes staff responsible for plant operations, including the plant Safety Officer, hydroclave technicians, tran sport personnel and labourers. Training will address a number of issues ranging from Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) training to waste handling and tracking. Training will include first aid, safe work procedures and hazard identification, including use of personal protective equipment, and equipment and process training. Transportation of Dangerous Goods training will include specific requirements for packaging and labelling of wastes, waste manifests, transportation placards and routing, as well as spill response and reporting. Employees will be trained in emergency procedur es in the event of an injury or exposure to potentially pathogenic or infectious materials. Training records will be maintained on site and training \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 18 updated as required by regulations ( e.g. annual WHMIS update training) or by changes in process equipment or operations. 2.10 Decommissioning The hydroclave equipment has a life expectancy of 25 years which may be extended with implementation of appropriate maintenance and repai r program. With equipment replacement, it is intended that the facility operate for more than 25 years. There is no current plan or schedule for decommissioning and abandonment of the facility. Decommissioning and abandonment will be undertaken in accordance with the regulatory requirements applicable at the time of such activities. Removal of buildings or structures is expected to have similar effects and considerations as construction and will be conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements applicable at the time of removal. Disposal of related waste will be conducted in accordance with NSEL waste management regulations and guidelines. 2.11 Project Schedule The Project will commence once all necessary provincial and federal approvals are in place and the Proponent has modified the facility to handle the treatment of biomedical waste ( e.g., installed security fence, refrigeration unit/area). Expansion of the facility will occur once the agreements with waste generators are in place such that the capacity of the existing facility can no longer handle volume of waste to be treated. The typical hours of operation for the proposed facility is from Monday to Friday from 08:00 to 18:00 hours, excluding holidays. The Proponent wishes to have the flexibility to increase the operating hours to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, year round, depending on the volume of waste to be treated and the status of the expansion. Given the location of the facility (within an industrial park), the limited interaction with the receiving environment (i.e., minimal emissions and noise), and the low volume of trucks hauling to and from the facility, continuous operation of the facility will not likely result in significant environmental effects. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 19 3.0 SCOPE As it is the intent of Bio-Medical Waste Services Inc. to expand current operations at Gloria McCluskey Drive to accommodate transfer and treatment of biomedical waste, the Project must be registered for Environmental Assessment under the Nova Scotia Environment Act . This report fulfils the primary requirements for Project Registration under this legislation. 3.1 Scope of the Undertaking The proposed Project involves the collection, treatment and disposal of biomedical waste originating from various institutions throughout Nova Scotia includi ng provincial facilities such as hospitals, clinics and laboratories as well as private facilities such as seniors' homes, extended care facilities, veterinary offices and hospitals, private laboratories and mortuaries. A portion of the waste which is not considered appropriate for treatment in the hydroclave system, ( i.e., the red bag waste, cytotoxics and pharmaceuticals) will be transferred for incineration to the existing incinerator facility in Moncton, New Brunswick. This facility, in operation for ten years, currently accepts biomedical waste from facilities throughout the Atlantic and Quebec. 3.1.1 Purpose and Need for the Undertaking Currently, biomedical waste collected from the provin cial hospitals and affiliated facilities is collected and transported to the Cape Breton Regional Municipality waste incinerator. This facility is scheduled for closure on December 31, 2005. As such, an alternative treatment and disposal of biomedical waste is required. In addition to the need to replace the capacity provided by the Cape Breton incinerator, there is the need for additional capacity to service the demand from a variety of waste generators as noted above. 3.1.2 Project Alternatives Bio-Medical Waste Disposal Services Inc. has conducted in depth research of a variety of technologies to determine the treatment method of choice to provide the required level of sterilization with minimal environmental impacts. The following alternative bi omedical waste treatment technologies were investigated. Microwave/Macrowave Technology Microwaving or macrowaving biomedical waste is not a widely used technology. The process involves treating biomedical waste using micro/ macrowaving which must be followed by incineration, as micro/macrowaving alone is not considered effective in treating biomedical waste. Double processing of the waste is required to achieve desired levels of treatment. Plasma Arc Technology Plasma arc treatment is an experimental technology and also requires incineration of the biomedical waste following treatment. Given the experimental nature of the process and the need for double processing, this alternative was not favoured. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 20 Molten Salt Treatment Molten salt treatment of biomedical waste requires that the volume of salt be adjusted depending on the volume and contents of each load of waste to be treated. The time and calculations required to employ this technology were considered inefficient. Hammermill Treatment The hammermill method involves the shredding of biomedi cal waste prior to treatment by submersion in a chemical bath. Concerns related to the use of this technology included the potential risk to employees from handling waste to shred it prior to treatment, the risk of cross contamination from untreated waste, difficulties cited with the mechanical aspect of the shredders used in this process, the disposal of chemicals used to treat the waste, and the 1992 CCME guidelines which indicate that this technology is not appropriate for treatment of pathogenic or cytotoxic waste. Having reviewed the above technologies as well as the proposed technology, Bio-Medical Disposal Services Inc. determined that the hydroclave process presented the most effective treatment with the least environmental concern. 3.2 Scope of the Envi ronmental Assessment Part IV Section 31 of the provincial Environment Act stipulates that projects prescribed as undertakings by the Minister or under the Environmental Assessment Regulations are subject to Ministerial approval under the environmental assessment process. As stipulated in Section 3 and Schedule A of the regulations, a permanent commercial facility for the handling of waste dangerous goods is a Class I Undertaking. As per Section 3 (2), the regulations also apply to the modification, extension, abandonment demolition or rehabilitation of an undertaking. Given that biomedical waste is considered a waste dangerous good under the provincial Dangerous Goods Management Regulations, Bio-Medical Waste Disposal Service Inc. is required to register this project as a Class I Undertaking pursuant to the Environmental Assessment Regulations under the Nova Scotia Environment Act . The Project is subject to a number of provincial and federal statutes applicable to the management and transportation of dangerous goods. Provincially, management of waste dangerous goods is regulated under the Dangerous Goods Management Regulations under the Environment Act , while the transportation of dangerous goods in the province is regulated by the provincial Dangerous Goods Transportation Regulations under the Dangerous Goods Transportation Act . These regulations describe the requirements of waste management, storage and transportation. Federally, the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act and Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations stipulate the requirements of transportation of dangerous goods. These requirements include, but are not limited to, details of required waste manifest information, packaging, signage, contingency planning and compatibility of shipping groups for transportation. Permits and approvals required for the proposed Project under this legislation include a Permit for Equivalent Level of Safety and approval of an Emergency Response Assistance Program. Since a portion of the waste that is not appropriate for hydroclave treatment will be transported to Moncton for incineration, the federal Interprovincial Movement of Hazardous Waste Regulations (IMHWR 2002) under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 applies. These regulations are applicable to substances identified under the federal Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 21 and require that the manifest and relevant attachment s be sent to the appropriate provincial authorities in the province of origin and destination. Mr. Shredding Waste Management Ltd. will be responsible for the transportation of waste from the proposed facility in Burnside to the approved incineration facility in Moncton. One of Canada's strategies to protect biological diversity is to address species at risk. These are native species that are sensitive to human activity due to their rare occurrence, restricted range in Canada, dependence on specialized habitats or declining populat ion or distribution (Canadian Wildlife Service 2004). This has been achieved through, amongst other initiatives, the Species at Risk Act (SARA). SARA serves to protect listed species by prohibiting activities that may harm individuals or critical habitat. Specific prohibitions under SARA came into force on June 1, 2004; those relevant to the proposed Project include the following: \u0083 Section 32 (1): No person shall kill, harm, harass, capture or take an individual of a wildlife species that is listed as an extirpated species, an endangered species or a threatened species. \u0083 Section 33: No person shall damage or destroy the residence of one or more individuals of a wildlife species that is listed as an endangered species or a threatened species, or that is listed as an extirpated species if a recovery strategy has recommended the reintroduction of the species into the wild in Canada. \u0083 Section 58: Subject to this section of the Act, no person shall destroy any part of the critical habitat of any listed endangered species or of any listed threatened species - or of any listed extirpated species if a recovery strategy has recommended the reintroduction of the species into the wild in Canada - if (a) the critical habitat is on federal land, in the exclusive economic zone of Canada or on the continental shelf of Canada; (b) the listed species is an aquatic species; or (c) the listed species is a species of migratory birds protected by the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994. Additional legislation applicable to the Project includes the provincial Activities Designation Regulations which stipulates the requirement for an approval to operate the facility. Domestic and office waste generated at the facility, such as paper, cardboard, garbage etc, will be sorted and disposed of in accordance with provincial Solid Waste Resource Management Regulations. Municipal by laws outline the requirements of a variety of permits and regulations related to construction and operation of the facility such as building and occupancy permits, wastewater management and land use, among others. The scope of the environmental assessment in relation to the proposed Project has been determined by the Proponent and their consultant and is based upon the proposed Project elements and activities, the professional judgement and expert knowledge of the study team, consultations with stakeholders and regulatory authorities on this and similar projects. The proponent and their consultant met with representatives of Nova Scotia Environment and Labour on March 24, 2005 to discuss the location, proposed expansion, and elements and activities associated with the proposed Project, in an effort to focus the scope of the assessment. Some NSEL representatives are familiar with the existing opera tion as it is currently permitted by NSEL. Business owners/operators adjacent to the existing facility were also contacted (see Section 4.0) for the purpose of consultation and issue identification. In an effort to further identify potential issues associated with the proposed Project and confirm the effectiveness of the system, existing hydroclave operators were contacted. The Director of Plant Engineering and Maintenance Services at the Kingston \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 22 General Hospital confirmed that the system in operat ion in the hospital has achieved the required level of sterilization 100% of the time. Despite provincial requirements to test the loads once every six days, KGH tests every load treated on site and have confirm ed that they have not yet had any loads fail compliance testing (J. Carr-Braint, pers. comm. April 2005). Further information related to the effectiveness of the technology is provided in the table below. TABLE 3.1 Consultation with Hydroclave Systems Operations Site Equipment Contact Application Effectiveness Kingston, ON H-100 (340 kg/hr capacity) Joel Carr-Braint, Director of Plant Engineering and Maintenance Services In hospital biomedical waste treatment 100% Ottawa, ON Eight H-15 (54 kg/hr capacity each) Katherine Flemming, Manager Environmental Services In hospital biomedical waste treatment 100% Aberdeen, SK H-65 (230 kg/hr capacity) Victor DeFehr, President BioMed Recovery & Disposal Treatment of Biomedical Waste (SK and AB) 100% There are several facilities throughout Canada and the world employing this technology to treat biomedical waste. As the provinces are responsi ble for waste management, testing requirements are stipulated under approvals and operating permits. In addition to the above, contact with provincial regulators was made to further to confirm and identify the various treatment methods in use in other jurisdictions and, opportunistically, identify potential issues associated with the technology. This information is summarized in Table 3.2 below and 4.1.

Installation of the condensation unit, which captures and condenses much of the vapours and discharges them to the municipal sewer system, resulted in significant improvements. This environmental assessment evaluates the potent ial environmental effects of the proposed Project elements and activities, for all Project phases, with regard to each of the identified Valued Environmental Component (VEC) and Valued Soci o-economic Component (VSC). By assessing potential impacts on VECs/VSCs within the study boundaries, a meaningful evaluation of Project effects on relevant environmental parameters is achieved. Giv en the nature of the Project, the location of the \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 23 Project within the industrial park and the limited potential for interaction with the biophysical and socio- economic environment, components evaluated include: \u0083 air quality (as a result of concern related to potential process air emissions and odours); \u0083 land use (given the nature of the facility with an urban area); and \u0083 transportation infrastructure in consideration of the potential effect of increased traffic in the vicinity of the Project on traffic patterns. A description of the bio-physical and socio-economic environment is provided in Section 5.0. Based on professional judgement and existing informat ion, and given the size, nature and location of the proposed Project, the Proponent and its consultants are confident that the zones of influence and subsequent boundaries of the assessment for this Project are limited. The physical footprint of Project will only be expanding to the adjacent lot, which is approximately 40 m x 50 m. The solid and liquid emissions will be disposed/discharged to an approved facility ( i.e., approved landfill and municipal sewer). Therefore, assessment of the terrestrial environment ( i.e., flora, fauna) is not considered appropriate for this Project. Furthermore, there are no streams or wetlands or other potentially sensitive ecological areas in the vicinity of the Proj ect or could be impacted by Project emissions. Archaeological and heritage resources have not been sele cted as a VSC in this assessment since the area has been determined to have low archaeological potential (M&NP 1998). Archaeological deposits, if present, would likely have been disturbed during previous industrial/commercial development of the surrounding lands. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 24 4.0 STAKEHOLDER AND PUBLIC CONSULTATION 4.1 Methods of Involvement The Proponent and their consultant met with representatives of NSEL on March 24, 2005 to identify potential issues of concern associated with the proposed Project and to focus the scope of the assessment. On April, 19, 2005, a Project Information Bulletin was distributed to all business owner/operators in the vicinity of the Project, specifically those along Gloria McCluskey Drive as well as other retail stores along Akerley Boulevard. A copy of the bulletin is provided in Appendix D. The purpose of the bulletin was to inform the neighbours of the proposed Project and identify issues and concerns associated with the Project to ensure they are addressed directly or in this EA report. 4.2 Stakeholder Comments and Steps Taken to Address Issues Table 4.1 summarizes the comments received and issues raised as a result of the issues scoping and consultation efforts described above and in Section 3.2 as well as the Proponent's proposed response or resolution. The table also includes a summary of regulator comments on a draft submission of the EA. TABLE 4.1 Summary of Stakeholder Comments and Concerns Raised By: Issue/Concern Response/Resolution NSEL Use of ozone depleting substances (ODS) The Proponent has committed that the conde nsation unit/chiller will be free of ODS. NSEL Sorting of waste and potential for inadvertent treatment of red bag waste The Proponent will employ a scanning and tracking system ( i.e., bar code system) for all red bag waste as it is collected from the waste generating facilities and scan all waste as it enters the facility as further assurance that only waste that is appropriate for treatm ent in the hydroclave is processed. NSEL Lack of knowledge/ understanding (i.e., the technology is new to Nova Scotia The Proponent has provided (in Appendix B) copies of correspondence and test results from other facilities in ot her jurisdictions employing the technology to raise the level of comfort of re viewing agencies and stakeholders. NSEL Mercury in waste Section 6.1 of th is report considers the potential issue. NSEL Monitoring of liquid emissions The Proponent will monito r liquid emissions from the facility in accordance with HRM's sewer use by-law or as otherwise directed. Kingston General Hospital, and Aberdeen, SK Odour Odours are minimized with the im plementation of the condensation unit. Carbon filtration will remove the remainder of the mercury and organic vapours including those that potentially cause odours (see Section 6.1). Kingston General Hospital Health and safety related to sharps in landfill Landfill operators (in the Ontario region ) were concerned about the health and safety of employees and requested that waste be shredded prior to disposal. The Proponent has incorporated shre dding equipment into the process (Section 2.4.1). Burnside Fleet Services Processing of anatomical waste (i.e., body parts) The proponent assured that the facility would not process such waste (Section 2.5). Such waste will be temporarily a nd properly stored on-site and transferred to an approved incineration facility in New Brunswick. NSEL and Environment Canada EIA may be required for incinerator in Moncton to accept out of province hazardous waste. The facility in Moncton is already authorized by the New Brunswick Department of Environment and Local Government to accept and treat hazardous waste of this nature at their facility (see Section 2.4.1). Nova Scotia Department of Health and NSEL Efficiency of the process to fully treat the waste. Additional information has been provided in Section 2.5 regarding confirmatory testing to ensure complete treatment of the waste. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 25 TABLE 4.1 Summary of Stakeholder Comments and Concerns Raised By: Issue/Concern Response/Resolution Nova Scotia Department of Health, NSEL, and Environment Canada Liquid effluent monitoring and air emissions monitoring Additional information regarding liquid effl uent is provided in Section 2.8.1.

The nearest surface water body is Enchanted Lake, and associated inflow and outflow streams, located approximately 250 m west of the facility. There are three storm sewers located on Gloria McCluskey Drive adjacent to the facility. Two are located along the street immediately in front of the proposed expansion facility and a third is located downgradient, approximately 50 m west of the facility. The topography of the site is such that the much of the surface runoff would drain to the vacant vegetated lot, south of the facility on Colford Avenue. Sediment-laden surface runoff will be managed on-site prior to discharge off-site. Surface runoff will likely be captured by the municipal storm sewers along Gloria McCluskey Drive or Colford Avenue. Therefore, the potential for Project to interact with Enchanted Lake is very limited, given the distance from the lake and the limited potential for surface runoff from the site. 5.1.2 Groundwater Resources The proposed Project is located within Burnside Industrial Park which obtains its water from the municipal system which draws its water from a fres hwater lake located approximately eight kilometres to the east-northeast of the site. No potable wells are known to exist within a two kilometre radius of the proposed site and therefore impacts to potable drinking water supplies are not likely to occur within the study area. Groundwater in the vicinity of the site may provide recharge the baseflow of the inflow and outflow streams and Enchanted Lake located approximately 250 meters downgradient from the site. The potential for impacts to groundwater and subsequently to the streams and lake are associated with a potential malfunction or accidental event where the underground storage tanks (holding liquid effluent) were to leak or rupture. In the event the proponent utilizes the tanks for longer term storage of liquid effluent prior to disposal, and depending on the concentration of metals or other deleterious substances in the effluent, precautions such as installi ng monitor wells down-gradient of the underground tanks should be implemented. 5.1.3 Terrestrial Habitat The study area contains four plant communities including white birch dominated forest, white birch/white pine forest, sweet fern dominated shrub thicket, and coltsfoot dominated vacant lot. No listed species were observed within the study area during the field surveys. A brief description of each is provided below and illustrated in Figure REPORT July 7, 2005 28 White Birch Dominated Forest White birch dominated forest occurs in a narrow strip at the northern edge of the property and is approximately 0.081 hectares (ha) in size. This area is a remnant of forest habitat that was left after the lot was grubbed and levelled. The stand is dominated by white birch ( Betula papyrifera ) but also contains some ) and red oak ( Quercus rubra ). The shrub understory consists of a dense layer of low ericaceous shrubs, the most abundant of which are stand is estimated to be approximately 40 years old and probably originated as a result of forest fires that burned this area in the 1960s. Coltsfoot Dominated Vacant Lot This plant community is found in the center of t he property on the most heavily disturbed areas and is approximately 0.126 ha in size. This area contains a lot of crushed rock which provides poor habitat for plants. There are no tree sized plants and shrub cover consists of a few willows ( Salix sp. ), blackberries birch seedlings. The ground vegetation layer is sparse and composed largely of patches Canada goldenrod. Most of the plant species found here are introduced weed species characteristic of ditches and old fields. A few tree and shrub species characteristic of early successional forests are present in small numbers. White Birch/White Pine Forest This plant community occupies a narrow strip at the southern edge of the property at the base of an infill, covering approximately 0.039 ha. The stand is dominated by a mixture of white birch and white pine with lesser amounts of red maple, red oak, red spruce are also present. The tree canopy of this stand is characterized by the presence of two distinct layers. The upper layer consists of large white pine with an estimated age of 70 years. The lower layer is estimated to be approximately 40 years old and is composed of white birch, red maple, red oak, red spruce, and large-tooth aspen. The large white pines are probably trees that survived the fire in the 1960s. The shrub underst ory is moderately dense and similar in species composition to the white birch forest. The dominant shrub species are sheep laurel, black huckleberry and late lowbush blueberry. Some white birch and red spruce saplings are also present in the shrub layer. The ground vegetation layer consists of a mixture of mosses, ferns and forbs. The Dicranum sp .). Sweet Fern Dominated Shrub Thicket Sweet Fern dominated shrub thicket is found on the steep slope at the southern end of the property and near the crest of the slope and covers approximately 0.165 ha. This area has been heavily disturbed by infilling which has resulted in the displacement of all of the forest plant species that once occupied this area. This plant community is characterized by low to moderate plant cover that consists of patches of low shrub cover dominated by sweet fern ( with patches of ruderal forbs and grasses. The most abundant of these species 2005 2005 29 Canada goldenrod ( Solidago canadensis ). The species composition in this community consists of a mixture of native and introduced species. Most of the species present are typically associated with highly disturbed sites and are not associated with forest habitats. 5.1.4 Wildlife Given the time of the year of the site visit it was not possible to conduct a wildlife survey on the property. JW has conducted a number of bird, mammal and herpetile surveys in the general vicinity of the property and is familiar with the wildlife species that inhabit this area. The property has low value as wildlife habitat given the small size of the property and the small amount of forest habitat present. No listed species are believed to be present near the site. Birds Few if any birds are expected to nest on the property. The area most likely to be used as nesting habitat is the thin fringe of white birch/white pine forest found at the southern edge of the property. This habitat is part of a patch of a mixedwood and har dwood forest, extending beyond the proposed Project footprint, which forms an island of forest cover approximately 2 ha in size. Birds that could potentially nest in this area It is unlikely that more than one pair of birds would nest within the area of mixedwood forest located within the property. The fringe of white birch dominated forest located at the northern edge of the property may provide nesting habitat for Song Sparrow ( Melospiza trichas ). Again, no more than one pair of birds is likely to nest in this area. The heavily disturbed areas on the property provi de few nesting opportunities for birds since there is little cover available to hide nests. Killdeer ( Charadrius vociferous ) is the only species likely to nest in these habitats. One rare bird species, Whip-poor-will ( Caprimulgus vociferous ) has been recorded within one kilometre of the study area. This species had been recorded in the area south of the study area near the present intersection of Burnside Drive and Akerley Boulevard. It has not been recorded in this area since 1988. Various surveys conducted in suitable habitat surrounding the study area have not recorded this species suggesting that it no longer nests in the area. Whip-poor-wills typically nest on the forest floor in dry hardwood forest. The small patch of hardwood forest at the northern edge of the study area would not be large enough to prov ide suitable nesting habitat for this species. Mammals Three mammal species were recorded during the site visit including red squirrel ( Tamiasciurus hudsonicus lotor ). Other species that may be expected to use the property would include eastern chipmunk ( (Napaeozapus insignis ). The property does not provide valuable habitat for mammals. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 30 Herpetiles The property provides limited habitat for herpetile species. There is no open water habitat so there is limited breeding habitat for amphibians. The only am phibians that would be expected to be present on a regular basis would be eastern redback salamander ( Eastern redback salamanders nest in subterranean burrows under rocks or in rotting logs and do not require open water for larval or adult stages. Adult eastern American toads can live in relatively dry habitats, however, they mu st return to permanent water bodies to breed. This species nests in sphagnum moss hummocks adjacent to pools in swamps and bogs. There is no suitable habitat for this species on the property. R eptile species that could be expected to use the property include Maritime garter snake ( Hemidactylium scutatum ), has been recorded approximately 400 m south of the property in a wetland located near Enchanted Lake. No other rare or sensitive herpetile species have been recorded in the area. 5.2 Socio-economic Setting Burnside Industrial Park is eastern Canada's largest industrial park. It is approximately 1,400 hectares in area with 1,300 businesses and 17,000 people. Ninety percent of the businesses are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), employing between 2 and 50 people. It is a very diverse park with several dozen sectors represented and in which m any of the sectors are represented by similar businesses. By sector, 10% of the businesses are in the manufacturing sector, 48% in sales and service, 11% in the construction industry, 9% in distribution and warehousing, 8% in retail and 14% in professional, financial and other business services. There are a large number of companies in the same categories. For example, there are approximately 18 businesses in the printing sector, 25 vehicle maintenance facilities, 20 companies involved in computer assembly and distribution, 17 companies in electronics sales and service, 17 businesses involved in chemical processing and distribution, 21 companies in paints and coatings, 17 companies in the metal plating and finishing category and 36 trucking companies. The park is serviced by road and rail. Halifax Regional Municipality provides wa ter, sanitary and storm sewers while the private sector provides elec trical and advanced telecommunications services. HRM has strengthened its development standards over the 25 year period since the Park was first established. The objectives of the standards and co venants which apply to the Park's development are: \u0083 to protect property values and enhance the investment of businesses located in the Park by providing a well planned and maintained development; \u0083 to create an attractive and efficient business environment through sound land use, planning and environmental management standards; and \u0083 to ensure harmonious relationships among uses. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 31 The covenants are intended \"to ensure that the Park continues to be developed in a manner consistent with superior aesthetic and environmental protection standards and with the declared intention of creating a pleasant and harmonious environment for the Park's residents.\" These covenants apply to architecture, landscaping, signage, protection of natural areas particularly streams, lakes and wetlands and require buffer zones of undisturbed habitat or suitable areas of green space around all watercourses. Burnside is composed of old areas, which are now being redeveloped (brown field), sections which are relatively new and areas yet to be developed (green field). Companies come and go and in some years as many as 10% of the businesses in the park are undergoing some change; locating in new premises, closing, opening, and expanding. Therefore there are continuing opportunities to investigate the application of the strategies in the transformation of the park into an industrial ecosystem. Burnside Park has excellent highway, airport, seaport, rail and public transit access. Its position on Bedford Basin near the A. Murray MacKay Bridge allows enterprises at Burnside to conveniently access amenities on both sides of the Halifax Harbour. When travelling within Halifax and beyond, Burnside Industrial Park is: \u0083 directly accessible to Highways 111, 118 and 107 \u0083 6 mi. (10 km) to Downtown Halifax CBD \u0083 3 mi. (5 km) to Ceres Container Terminal \u0083 7 mi. (11 km) to Halterm Container Terminal \u0083 13 mi. (21 km) to Halifax International Airport \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 32 6.0 VALUED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC COMPONENTS AND EFFECTS ASSESSMENT Field studies were conducted by Jacques Whitford In March and April 2005 and consisted of a tour of the existing facility during operation as well as site reconnaissance surveys to describe the proposed expansion area and neighbouring businesses. Temporal and spatial boundaries encompass those periods during, and areas within which, the VECs are likely to interact with, or be influenced by, the Project. Both the temporal and spatial boundaries for the assessment vary according to the VEC, but are generally limited to the duration of, and for a period of time after, the activities and the immediate Project area unless otherwise noted. To assess the potential environmental effects of a project and determine the significance of an effect, it is important to consider the magnitude, frequency, duration, geographical extent and reversibility of the potential effect. The study team has considered these elements for each VEC/VSC, as well as the following: \u0083 negative effects on the health of biota; \u0083 loss of rare or endangered species; \u0083 biological diversity; \u0083 loss of critical/productive habitat; \u0083 fragmentation of habitat or interruption of movement corridors and migration routes; \u0083 transformation of natural landscapes; \u0083 discharge of persistent and/or toxic chemicals; \u0083 toxicity effects on human health; \u0083 reductions in the capacity of renewable resources to meet the needs of present and future generations; and \u0083 loss of current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes by Aboriginal persons. 6.1 Atmospheric Environment 6.1.1 Description of Existing Environment NSEL monitors air quality at ten stations across Nova Scotia susceptible to air quality problems. Common air pollutants monitored regularly are sulphur dioxide (SO 2), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), ground level ozone (O 3), nitrogen dioxide (N 2O), and hydrogen sulphide (H 2S). Exceedances for these contaminants are generally small and infrequent in Nova Scotia. The closest NSEL monitoring site is in downtown Halifax. Air quality in the region is generally good, with fe w exceedances noted from the downtown station. Occasional odours may be found in the vicinity of the Project originating from the nearby composting facility. Few other facilities in the immediate area of the proposed Project have a perceptible odour. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 33 6.1.2 Potential Effects, Mitigation, Monitoring and Follow-up The hydroclave process is a batch process, with an approximate 90 minute cycle time. During the heating phase of the cycle, the liquid in the waste is converted to vapour which pressurizes the inner chamber during the treatment period. When the pressure is released, it is done through a vent that directs the vapour to a chiller condenser unit. The water vapour and certain other materials including some volatile organic compounds are largely captured in the condensation phase in the chiller. Within the condenser, the water vapour is returned to the liquid phase which will be either directed to the municipal sanitary sewer system, underground holdi ng tanks for subsequent disposal at an approved facility, or mixed with the sterile dry waste and disposed of at an approved landfill facility. Quantities of condensate are likely to range from a few millilitres to a few hundred millilitres from each load. As no air is used to purge the treatment vessel, t he emission from the unit will consist largely of the release of air volume within it when the loading door is opened and processed material removed. Thus the actual volume of air released during the cycle is approximately equal to or less than the volume of the treatment cylinder. There is no purging of the sy stem before, during, or following the sterilization process. Hydroclave technology employed at t he Kingston General Hospital has been monitored for contaminants in these air releases. Their samples included an extensive list of target compounds, but only four were found at levels comparable to the criteria for Ontario occupational health and safety. These criteria are applicable to time-averages, whereas the release from opening the hydroclave is in the nature of a brief puff at the release point. Acetone, carbon disulphide, methyl ethyl ketone and styrene were detected at the unloading door of the hydroclave. Detectable levels of carbon disulphide, benzene, styrene and vinylidene chloride were detected in the exhaust from the condenser. It should be noted that due to the short cyclic nature of the emissions, the sampling was conducted on a \"grab\" basis from the maximum release at opening. Emissions from the Kingston facility were directed to a roof top vent. The proposed facility will direct ventilation exhaust to a scrubber. Tests conducted for the hydroclave facility in Port Coquitlam, BC (A. Lanfranco, 2002) showed that the stack emissions contained no significant organic compounds. It is anticipated that the results of testing for the proposed undertaking will be similar, and that there will be no significant impact on the environment. Testing during commissioning will be conducted to confirm that the capture efficiency at the opening of the hydroclave is protective of worker health and safety, and that the efficiency of the scrubber unit is protective of emissions to the environment. The scrubber inlet/outlet capture efficiency will be determined by real-time measurements using an ultra sensitive device for measuring volatile organic compounds ( e.g., ppbRAE). During the commissioning phase, a series of readings will be taken and the results will be used, in conjunction with the manufacturer's recommended practice, to determine an appropriate and safe replacement procedure for the scrubber filter elements. The results of work to date have indicated that the process emissions can meet the more rigorous air quality standards of Ontario where the specific volatile organic compounds are regulated. This work was directed at occupational health and safety compliance and not on emission testing. Accordingly, the proponent will conduct confirmation testing of the exhaust against the Ontario criteria and modify the scrubber system, if required, to meet the point of impingement criteria. In addition to the above, there will be exhaust emi ssions from trucks delivering waste material to and from the facility. The existing facility location was selected to help optimize the routing of traffic ( i.e., close proximity and easy access fr om many provincial highways ( e.g., Highway 107, 111, and 118) \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 34 thereby minimizing volume of traffic and associated emissions. To further minimize vehicle emissions, trucks will be maintained regularly and kept in good wo rking. As part of the extensive training program for the drivers, they will be instructed on the ways in which environmental impacts may be minimized. This will include driving styles and behaviours, and t he strict enforcement of no-idling policies. The impact of the vehicle emissions on the environment will not be significant. The facility will use test results from commissioning to ascertain the potential quantities of substances that are reportable through the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) and will determine the eligibility for reporting and take appropriate action. The results of the determination will be kept on file and updated as required. It is estimated that the process and vehicle emissions will have no significant effect on the environment. 6.2 Land Use 6.2.1 Description of Existing Environment As noted in Section 5.2, Burnside Industrial Park hosts commercial and industrial facilities of various sizes and sectors. Ship to Shore, an associate co mpany of Bio-medical Waste Disposal Services ( i.e., common ownership) currently operates a hydroclave fac ility at 93 Gloria McCluskey Drive (Lot 938 (PID 41028184)) which currently treats international waste. Northwest of the site is the Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility. Other nearby industrial/commercial land uses on Gloria McCluskey Avenue include: Tire; and \u0083 Atlantic Tractors and Equipment Ltd (sales/rental of CAT equipment). Other nearby land uses include a Pressure Regulating Station for the Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline (M&NP) Halifax Lateral Pipeline, and a water suppl y tower owned by HRM. These facilities are typically not permanently staffed. The proposed site for the expansion of the existing facilit y is a vacant site located immediately adjacent to (east) the existing facility operated by Ship to S hore. This property is currently owned by HRM. 6.2.2 Potential Effects, Mitigation, Monitoring and Follow-up The site for the proposed facility and possible expansion are located in Burnside Industrial Park in an area zoned for industrial and commercial purposes. The aesthetics of the facility and proposed operations would be compatible with existing infrastructure and land uses in this area. There will be some noise associated with construction of the new facility, however this noise will be temporary ( i.e., over a 20 week construction period) and will not exceed the NSEL Noise Guidelines. As noted in Section 5.2 and 6.2.1, the majority of land uses in the area are industrial/commercial in nature and would not be sensitive to this construction noise. While the Correctional Facility could be \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 35 considered a more sensitive receptor, the predicted sound levels associated with construction would likely be masked by existing ambient noise levels in that area ( e.g., existing traffic and processing facilities) and therefore not likely distinguishable at this source. There will be minimal noise emissions associated with operation of the expanded facility, with the largest contributor of noise being truck traffic entering and leaving the facility. This type of noise is consistent with existing land use activity of the existing and adjacent facilities and sound levels currently occurring in the immediate area. Transportation issues associated with the Project, including consideration of cumulative effects with existing traffic levels are addressed in Section 6.3. There are therefore no predicted significant adverse environmental effects on land use as a result of this Project. No monitoring or follow-up measures are proposed with respect to land use. 6.3 Transportation Infrastructure 6.3.1 Description of the Existing Environment The proposed Project is located on Gloria McCluskey Drive in the northwest end of the Burnside Industrial Park. This region of the Park is easily accessible from the major throughways in the Park ( i.e., Burnside Drive and Akerley Boulevard) and many prov incial highways such as Highway 107, 111, 118, 101 and 102 and Route 7. Akerley Boulevard is a four lane street with a curbed median. The street is a primary entrance point to Burnside Park, connecting to Highway 107 and Highway 118 just east of the intersection of Gloria McCluskey Ave. and John Savage Ave. Akerley Bl vd. also provides the primary connection between Gloria McCluskey Ave. / John Savage Ave. and Burnside Drive. Traffic data for Akerley Blvd, both east and west of the intersection with Gloria McCluskey Drive, was collected in support of this EA. The 2004 traffic volume data show an average weekday volume of 23,000 vehicles per day west of Gloria McCluskey Drive ( i.e., between Burnside Drive and Gloria McCluskey Drive). The peak hour traffic volumes were 2,300 in the morning and 2,200 in the afternoon/evening. On the east side of the intersec tion with Gloria McCluskey Drive, the average weekday volume is 18,000 vehicles per day with a morning peak of 2,000 vehicles per hour and an afternoon/evening peak of 1,900 vehicles per hour. For the existing operation, which treats international waste, approximately 1 vehicle per day transport untreated waste to the facility and an additional 1 vehicle per day haul treated waste from the facility to the Otter Lake Waste Management Facility. This level of traffic is not anticipated to change as a result of the Project. The level of traffic associated with the Project is presently not known at this time; however, once expanded, the potential level of traffic hauling waste to the facility could be 3-4 vehicles per day and that hauling treated waste from the facility could be 1 vehicle per day. These values are based on the treatment capacity of the proposed expanded facility. The volume of traffic hauling red bag and other waste not suitable for hydroclave treatment, could be 1 vehicle per week \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 36 6.3.2 Potential Effects, Mitigation, Monitoring and Follow-up As indicated in Section 2.7.2, truck traffic delivering waste to the facility will be originating from various locations around the province. Truck will also haul the treated waste to an approved landfill facility. Due to the nature of the material being hauled, vehicle operators will follow a predetermined route from the waste generating facilities directly to the treatment facility. Haul routes will be identified in advance and will be done so in consultation with the Emergency Response Assistance contractor for the Project. Given the location of the Project within an industrial park, its proximity to prov incial highways and major roads, and the anticipated volume of traffic associated with the Project compared to the existing traffic volumes on Akerley Blvd, there are no predicted significant adverse environmental effects on traffic infrastructure as a result of this Project. No monitoring or follow-up measures are proposed with respect to traffic. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 37 7.0 EFFECTS OF THE PROJ ECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT Activities associated with this proposed Project will be conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Environmental Assessment Appr oval and the amended Industrial Approval for the facility. Environmental effects of the Project will include minor air emissions and a slight increase in traffic. Terrestrial habitat within the expansion footprint indicates that this area does not include unique habitat or rare or sensitive species; therefore, these effects are not anticipated to be significant. Assuming the mitigative measures specified in this report are implemented, and the Project is operated according to municipal, provincial, and federal legislation, guidelines and approvals, no significant adverse residual environmental or socio-economic effects are likely. Positive effects associated with the Project include: \u0083 reduction in air emissions from incineration; \u0083 greener technology ( i.e., no chemical treatment); and \u0083 more central facility (as opposed to the existing incineration facility). With respect to employment, a positive effect for t he operation will be realized; however, this benefit to the operation may result in a decrease in employ ment at other similar waste handling and treatment facilities. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 38 8.0 EFFECTS OF THE ENVI RONMENT ON THE PROJECT The definition of an environmental effect often includes any change to the project that may be caused by the environment. Potential effects of the environment on the Project, in this instance, are predominantly related to extreme weather events. On a national basis, Canada shows a warming and cooling pattern with a higher overall warming trend of approximately 1.1 \u00baC since 1895. The Atlantic Region, however, shows a warming trend from 1895 which peaked in the mid 1950s, followed by a cooling trend in the 1990s. The overall warming trend of 0.4 \u00baC in Atlantic Canada since 1895 is not statistica lly significant. With respect to precipitation, the Atlantic Region shows an overall increasing trend in precipitation since 1948, with an increasing trend in the number of daily precipitation events above 20 mm and a slightly increasing trend in the number of daily snowfall events above 15 cm (Lewis 1997). These changes would not affect the project. The building and lot will be designed to accommodate extreme precipitation conditions. No flooding would occur on this property. Extreme weather events such as heavy snow fall or blizzard events, or heavy fog, wind, or rainfall have potential to affect the transportation of the waste during collection or transfer and/or could result in a loss of power at the facility. Treated waste is contained in bins which can provide storage until the processed waste can be transferred to the approved disposal facility. Contingencies are in place to provide for temporary storage of the untreated waste should extreme weather dictate the need to delay transfer of red bag, cytotoxic and pharmaceutical waste to Moncton. The refrigeration systems would provide adequate storage capacity for extended peri ods of weather-induced or maintenance-induced delays. Such events are anticipated to be of s hort duration and the provisional storage would provide for safe containment of the waste until the weather permits resumption of transportation. As an additional contingency measure in the event of ex tended power interruptions, waste can be transported to the incineration facility in Moncton, New Brunswick. There is potential for heavy rainfall to affect the Project during the construction phase. Grading and site preparation activities will be minimized conducted dur ing these periods. This will be a temporary effect and is not considered significant. In summary, climate and meteorological conditions, including climate change, are not anticipated to significantly effect the operation of the Project over its proposed lifetime. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 39 9.0 OTHER APPROVALS REQUIRED As noted in Section 3.2 a permanent commercial facility for the handling of waste dangerous goods is subject to environmental assessment as a Class I undertaking under the provincial Environment Act Environmental Assessment Regulations. Other provincial approvals required to operate the faci lity include an Approval pursuant to the Activities Designation Regulation, the approval of plans and specifications to construct and repair a steam plant (the boiler) under the Steam Boiler and Pressure Vessel Act Steam Boiler and Pressure Vessel Regulations. Federal approvals and permits required for the Project relate to the transportation of waste and include a Permit of Equivalent Level of Safety and approval of the Emergency Response Assistance Program. Compliance with federal, provincial and municipal regulations and by laws referenced in Section 3.2 is also required. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 40 10.0 FUNDING This Project will be 100% privately funded. \u00a9 2005 PROJECT NSD19482 FINAL REPORT July 7, 2005 41 11.0 REFERENCES 11.1 Literature A.

PROPOSED BIOMEDICAL WASTE TR EATMENT AND TRANSFER FACILITY BURNSIDE INDUSTRIAL PARK, DARTMOUTH, NS Introduction Ship to Shore Disposal Service Inc. (Ship to Shore) is currently operating a commercial waste treatment facility on Gl oria McCluskey Drive in the Burnside Industrial Pa rk in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia (see Figure 1). The facility, which treats international food wast e, is operating under an approval from the Nova Scotia Department of the Environment and Labour (NSDEL) (Approval No. 2004- 038723, issued on February 27, 2004). The treatment method consists of sterilization of the waste at a temperature between 121 and 132 \u00b0C (depending on the treatment time ) and 15 psi pressure in a hydroclave unit (see process descripti on below). Once treated, the residua l solid waste is transported to an approved landfill for final disposal. Bio-Medical Waste Disposal Service Inc., an affiliate of Ship to Shore, wishes to expand the treatment process and capacity at the existing facility on Glor ia McCluskey Drive to al low for treatment of bio- medical waste from a number of facilities such as hospitals, dentist offices, and veterinary hospitals. Depending on the volume of waste to be treated ( i.e., if a large contract were awarded), the facility would expand to the adjacent property in order to accommodate construction and operation of two additional hydroclave units. It is understood that biomedical waste is considered a waste dangerous good under the Dangerous Goods Management Regulatio ns; therefore, Bio-Medical Waste Disposal Service Inc. is required to register this project as a Class I Undert aking pursuant to the Environmental Assessment Regulations under the Nova Scotia Environment Act . Process Description The proposed process utilizes a hydroclave unit to sterilize the waste. A hydroclave is a double walled vessel in which the inner wall provides containmen t for the waste and the outer wall forms a steam chamber surrounding the inner vessel. The heat from th e steam raises the temperature inside the vessel and causes the liquids/moisture in the waste to va porize. The pressure, high temperature and steam result in the complete sterilization of the waste. The residual solids are then shredded and compacted prior to transportation and dispos al at an approved facility. The biomedical waste treatment process will follow the same basic and proven process as that which is currently underway. The process will begin with collection of the waste from the various facilities/institutions and transportation to the treatm ent and transfer facility via trucks, cube vans, and/or secure refrigerated vehicles , where required. The waste is stor ed indoors until it is processed. Red-bag waste will be stored on-site in a refrigerated area for subse quent transportation to an approved incineration facility in Ne w Brunswick. Bagged waste ( i.e., yellow bags and containers) are loaded NSD 19482 Proposed Biomedical Waste Treatment and Transfer Facility Page 2 Project Information Sheet March 24, 2005 directly into the hydroclave unit by staff fully trained in applicable procedures. The waste in the inner vessel is rotated, breaking it into smaller pieces. St eam then fills the outer wall chamber (or jacket) heating the inner vessel and contents. The temperat ure and pressure are maintained at the required levels to ensure comple te sterilization (e.g., 121 \u00b0C and 15 psi pressure for 30 minutes). The moisture content in the waste is vaporized, reducing th e volume by as much as 40%, depending upon the moisture content of the waste. Th e vent is open to depressurize the unit with vapours directed to a chiller where the sterile liquid is condensed and routed to th e municipal sewer system. The mixing continues in the heated vessel until the waste is dry. Once dry, the waste is removed from the hydroclave by reversing the rotation of the mixer, pus hing the dry, sterile waste out the loading door to the conveyor leading to the shredder. The dry steri lized waste is put through a shredder which further breaks down the waste to \u00bc in and then compacted and transported to an a pproved disposal facility. Specific Project details include: Waste to be processed includes bi omedical waste from hospitals, dentist offices, and veterinary hospitals. The existing facility processes (approxim ately) 800 tonnes of waste per year. It is estimated that the expa nded facility could process appr oximately 3,000 tonnes of waste per year. Emissions associated with the waste include liquid, solid and emissions. Specifically these emissions include sterile condensate from the steam which is likely to be discharged directly to the municipal sewer system (as per current and simila r operations), air emissions when unit is opened and unloaded ( i.e., VOCs), and the residual (sterilized) so lid waste which is transported and disposed of at an approved facility. The operation schedule for the existing facility is 8 hours/day, 5 days per week, and 52 weeks per year. The anticipated operation schedule for the expa nded facility is 10 hours per day, 5-6 days per week, and 52 weeks per year. To date, there have been no comp laints regarding noise, odours or other emissions from the facility currently employing this technology. There are a number of industrial, commercial and institutional f acilities operating in the area including, Miller Waste's composting facility, M iller Tires, Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline's pressure reduction station and odourant inj ection station, and the Correctional facility. Drainage and surface runoff collection and controls will be in place for the construction of the new facility. Proposed Scope of the En vironmental Assessment The environmental assessment registration will eval uate potential environmenta l effects of the project and identify appropriate mitigation and monitoring to minimize these effects. The assessment will focus on those valued environmental components a nd socio-economic components of most concern and relevance. Due to limited nature and extent of the proposed Project ( i.e., limited potential for NSD 19482 Proposed Biomedical Waste Treatment and Transfer Facility Page 3 Project Information Sheet March 24, 2005 interaction with the biophysical environment), the proposed environmental components to be evaluated include: atmospheric environment including air quality and noise; and socio-economic environment including a discussion of adjacent land use, tr ansportation, and local economy. Due to the location of the proposed Project ( i.e., in a large industrial park), it is proposed that public consultation be limited to direct contact and/or distribution of a project information bulletin to neighboring Date: March 24, 2005 Project: NSD194820 100 200 300 400 MetresNBiomedical Waste Disposal Services Property BoundaryWaterbodyElevation Contour (m)WatercourseRoad Networks Major Road Minor RoadProperties PropertyProposed Expansion Akerley Boulevard Burnside Drive Akerley BoulevardLeonsCorrectional Facility CAT "}
