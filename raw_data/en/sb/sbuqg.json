Treating the body, mind and spirit Sy graduated from the [Academy for Five Element Acupuncture](https://acupuncturist.edu/ ) in Gainesville, Florida. An ancient form of medicine, Classical Five Element Acupuncture works by treating a person at the level of body, mind and spirit. It enables a person to move back into harmony with themselves, their emotions, and their life as a whole. From addictions to muscle sprains, insomnia to anxiety, infertility to gastric upset, Sy approaches each patient with an integrated and holistic approach to allow the body and mind to heal itself. Treating young children to people of advanced age, Sy designs treatments by considering each person's unique and individual case to achieve relief from a wide variety of symptoms - whether physical illness or injury, or mental and emotional stress. In Five Element Acupuncture, two people with identical Western diagnoses will receive different treatments due to the uniqueness of each person and their personal relationship to their disease. Chinese medicine, at its core, is holistic and unifying for a patient. Clear insight, void of cultural overlay, family expectation or what the internet says we should be, allows the patient to move past such things as trauma, toxicity, or stagnation and to even mitigate genetic deficiencies. By inserting needles in specific acupuncture points, Five Element Acupuncture induces movement on all levels, rebalancing the patient at a core level and reminding the patient of their potential in moving past their wounds. Formulating individualized treatment plans At the beginning of each treatment, Sy talks to the patient in an effort to discover how they fare on that particular day in regards to their main complaint and how they are doing overall. Listening on several different levels, Sy pays close attention to what is being said and also how the patient says it. Nuances in voice inflection indicate prevailing emotions that a patient may not even know are there. Those inflections indicate how the internal organs are processing experience and indicate which organ might be overworked, stagnate or deficient. Pulses, both on the right and left wrists, are a major diagnostic tool for Sy, allowing him to assess different areas of the body and what might need support in that treatment. A quick glance at the tongue coupled with information gleaned from the pulse and what the patient said allows Sy to formulate a treatment plan for that day. Tiny monofilament needles inserted in very specific points along the body induce the movement necessary to rebalance the body and promote healing. About Sy, acupuncturist Sy has over 20 years of study and practice in traditional Chinese medicine, including a five-year apprenticeship with a traditionally trained acupressurist herbalist. Sy uses his experience while working closely with the stellar providers who make up the Natural Health Center team. Subscribing to the idea that two heads are better than one, Sy confers with the naturopaths, chiropractors, body workers and the other acupuncturists to provide balanced, thorough healthcare with an emphasis on natural, effective methods to produce changes in a patient's health. As a lifelong Alaskan, Sy values the unique opportunities living this far North provides. When not at the Natural Health Center, he can be found skiing, hiking, hunting or fishing with his beautiful wife and two boys.
