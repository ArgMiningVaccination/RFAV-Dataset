The program aimed to encourage be tter linkages between plans, providers, and community organizations to im prove care delive ry. This overview summ arizes the key findings from the evaluation of PEMC that was comm issioned by C HCF and conducted Mathem atica Policy Research, Inc. (MPR). It complem ents th e more detailed report on evaluation findings and provides an abbreviated desc ription of the f indings tha t are of general interest to stakeholders in both California and the nation who are concerned about providing ca re for frail, at-risk elders.2 A. PROGRAM BACKGROUND Health insurance tends to favor the delivery of acute care s ervices\u2014e specially wh en care is paid for on a fee-for-service basis. Under such an arrangem ent, providers have few incentives to provide services that m ay not be well com pensated, such as care m anagem ent. These barriers to innovation are less prevalent in risk-based m anage d care organizations (MCOs) that are paid a set fee per m ember per m onth, regardless of th e services provided. The Program for Elders in Managed C are sought to take advantage of Ca lifornia's m ature managed care m arket to encourage partnerships between m anaged c are organizations, provid er organizations, and community-based organ izations to improve care deliv ery. In pursuing th is goal, CHCF received encouragem ent from other foundations and groups that recognized the value in focusing on frail elders; plans and m edical groups were already focused on dis ease managem ent. It was also believed that the Foundation coul d play an important role both in bringing into focus the complex needs of frail elders with multiple conditions and in help ing to f orge lin ks between medical groups and community-based organizations. PEMC included two cycles of grants. Im plementation gra nts for up to $1 m illion over a three-year period were awarded to test and eval uate specific interventions, and grantees were given substantial leeway to lop alte rnativ e inte rventions that inv th par tners (plans, providers, and comm unity organizations). Grantees were required to conduct rigorous independent outcom es evaluations based on a random ized design. P lanning grants of up to $75,000 for one year were intended to provide \"seed money\" to develop prom ising interventions 1See for e xample, Gera rd Anders on and Ja mes R. Kn ickman, \"C hanging the Chronic Care System to ds\" Health Affairs 20(6): 146-160, Novem ber/Decem ber 2001; Edward H. Wagner, T.

In addition, the program made or oversaw grants on an ad hoc basis as opportunities arose for several relate d activities that involved com plementary work to im prove care to frail elders. In total, PE MC funded nine im plemen tation grants, thirteen planning grants, and three relate d-activity grants, two of whic h involved direct delivery of servic es. Af ter th e first year or s o, the UCLA Multica mpus Program for Geriatrics an d Gerontology took over the program adm inistrati on from CHCF. In addition, since its inception, the program receiv ed guidance fro m an adviso ry comm ittee that included local and nationa with diverse perspec tives and expertise. Comm ittee members were involved both in program design and applicant review. B. EVALUATION DESI GN CHCF comm issioned MPR to evaluate PEMC after a competitive process in spring 2002, when the program was nearing its end. The ev aluation was designed both to complem ent the grantees' independent evalua tions of project outcom es and to provide a program wide perspective. Specifically, MPR' s evaluation was intended to: Develop an understanding of which features of the project models could im prove care delive ry for frail elders; Discern how well the m odels perform ed and whether they could be sustained; and Assess what factors drove or im peded success. At the Foundation's request, the MPR evaluati on was to build on secondary sources of inform ation available through the program along with a lim ited amount of addition al data collection. Data sources therefore included the following: (1) program /grantee reports; (2) results of the independent evaluations conducted by each implementation grantee; (3) independent and semistructured interv iews conducted by MPR w ith each of the grantees and oth er program participan ts; and (4) a r eview of the lite rature on how to im prove care for frail elders and sim ilar subgroups using dem onstrations as well as other m eans. C. EVALUAT ION FINDINGS Overview . CHCF funded eleven grants to test innovative case m anagem ent and disease manage ment interventions for frail elders. Two of the grants did not becom e oper ational. The other nine w ere subject to rigorous evaluations (independent of the MPR ev aluation), with all but one involving a random ized clinical trial design. Most of the projec ts did not achieve statistically significant results on measured outcom es or l ead to sustainable interventions. The lack of signif icant results is m ost likely a ttributab le to a com bination of factors, including am bitious outcom es goals for the case m anagement interventions tested, shortcom ings in design, and problem s encountered in im plementation. The inst ability in both the Me dicare m anaged care market and a mong provider groups involved in the interventions also affected the results. Though lacking significant results, P EMC generated im portant insights releva nt to the challenges likely to be associa ted w ith future ef forts to coord inate care fo r frail elders . viii 1. What Kind s of Interventions Were Tested Under PEMC? PEMC funded nine implem entation grants, al ong with two related-ac tivity grants that involved care delivery. (See Tabl e 1 for a summ ary of the PE MC-funded and related-activity grants.) Of the nine im plem entation grants, seven focused on general care manage ment for frail elders and the other two we re specif ic to dem entia. The two related-ac tivity grants that involved care delivery supported dis ease-specific interventions for frail elders\u2014one on depression, which was part of a na tional program , and one on diabetes. Implementation Grants for General Care Ma nagement. PEMC's implem entatio n grants rovide grantees with flexib ility in designing strategies for im proving care for frail elders. The lead sponsors of the nine PE MC im plementation grants were a diverse group. Three were m anaged care plan s (Kaiser TriCentr al, Pacif icare/Secu re Horizons, and On Lok Senior Health Services Senior Health Serv ices); three were comm unity-based grou ps (Jewish Family and Children Se rvices [ JFCS] , the Institute on Aging [ IOA], and the Calif ornia Ins titute for Rural Health Managem ent [CIRHM]); one was a provider group (Sharp HealthCare); on e was an academ ic group (UCLA Neuropsychiatri c Institu te [UCLA NPI]), and one was an organization consulting for CalPERS (Long-Term Care Group [LTCG]). Of the seven im plem entation grants invo lving general care m anagem ent, two were terminated before they becam e operational.3 One of the two grantees, On Lok Se nior Health Services, was delayed in receiving a waiver from the Health Care Financing Adm inistration (HCFA, now the Centers for Med icare and Med icaid Services, or CMS). The waiver was needed to test ref inement of a Program for All- inclu sive Care for the Elderly (P ACE) model intended to attract m ore beneficiaries to On Lok Senior Heal th Services's system of support by incorporating a free-standing physician network. The m odel aim ed to accommoda te beneficiaries who were reluc tant to enroll if it m eant severing a rela tionship with their prim ary care provider. (The waiver has since been approved, and the program is operational.) The second term inated grant, CIRHM, targeted the City of Lom poc in rura l Santa Barbara County a nd was ended when the participating m anaged care plan severed links w ith the independent practice association (IPA) participating in the project after the IPA encountered financial problem s. The rem aining five implem entation grant and JFCS\u2014each used different algorithm s to identify seniors at high risk, assess their needs, m ake referrals, and coordinate care. Tw o of these five grantees were particularly unique: (1) Ka iser TriCentral was unique in testing a benefit expansion for home- and comm unity-based services; and exercis e pr imarily f or hea lthier senio rs who were enrolled in a m anaged care plan and had purchased long-term care insurance from CalPERS and had at least one chronic condition. 3 A t hird gran t (JFCS) became o perational but the grantee was unable to test th e intervention through a randomized desi gn beca use physicians did not refer sufficient patients to the program to support it. ix TABLE 1 .

What Did the MPR Evaluation Find? MPR's evaluation focused on learning about the developm ent of the im plem entation grants, grantees' ex perien ces, and the reaso ns for these experiences. Key findings are described below. Impetus fo r Participa tion. For th e most part, the im petus for grante es' pa rticipa tion in PEMC see med to reflect the convergence of thre e forces: (1) a local \"champion\" who had heard of the grant opportunity and who wa s interested in developing an in itiative and read y to take the lead on it; (2) m anage ment's per ception th at the kind of initiati ve envisioned would be to the advantage of the organization a nd consistent with its m ission an d business interests; and (3) broad awareness of the CHCF call for propos als for PEMC a nd applicant interest. Extent of Implemen tation. All grantees appeared to ha ve m ade a good-faith effort to implement the initiatives proposed. In a few c ases, the design was modified in response to unanticipated problem s or issues . During interviews and observati ons at program meetings, the enthusiasm and comm itment of those particip ating in PEMC was obvious. However, in two cases, grants were term inated before im plementation. One (On Lok Senior Health Services) appeared to have been caught in unavoidable regulatory dela ys. The other (CIRHM) was a riskier pro ject becaus e it was located in an area w ith less m anaged care ex perien ce. Both CIRHM and JFCS encountered problem s in the stability of their participating organizations that stemm ed from the Medicare+C hoice (M+ C) marketplace, which made progress on implem entation difficult. Implementation Challenges. Internal ch allen ges delay ed project implem entation and probably lim ited the ef fectivenes s of the interv entions. The tim e required to gain approval from institutional review boards (IRBs) delayed the start of several pr ojects. In addition, recruiting participan ts was a challe nge f or almost all of the projects. This m ade implem entation not only more difficult but also m ore tim e-consum ing th an expected. In contrast, random ization went relatively w ell, and data problem s were rare\u2014p erhaps ref lecting the importance of including these elem ents in the initi atives from the start. Staff turnover and general instability in som e of the af filiate d organiza tions was common and m ade entation more dif ficult or, in th e extrem e case, im possible. In contrast, m ost gra ntees were able to m aintain the support of their physician groups; however, when they did not, the c onsequences were very disruptive. Sim ilarly, medical, community-based, and largely social s ervice agencies worked well togeth er, despite th e challenges involved. Role of the External Enviro nment in Pro ject Outco mes. The M+C m arket in both California and the natio n becam e very unstab le after PEM C was i mplem ented. This ins tability had an obvious effect on som e projects\u2014partic ularly the Brown and Toland Medical Group and the pressures it created f or PacifiCare/Secure Hori zons, a m ajor m anaged care partner in several grants. Th e tigh t econ omic enviro nment also probably reinforced concerns about the cost- effectivenes s of the interventions an d their bus iness rationale, but these concerns were present at the sta rt of the projec t. Yet while th e adverse n ature of the m arket put stress on the organizations that m ade resources scarce and success m ore difficult, it may be that the environm ent was less of a funda mental influence on project outcom es than we re the internal challenges facing grantees in xii developing operational large-im pact projects that could be m ounted quickly. W ith the benefit of hindsight, m any grantees wondere d whether their interventions could have been tweaked to perform better or if they could have better targeted individuals more like ly to gene rate positive outcom es. This suggests that both the rapid move ment to im plementation without extensive planning and pilot testing and th e overall challenges related to delivering better care to frail elders are fundam ental reasons why gr antees were not m ore successful. Accomplish ments and Sustainability. Becau se the g rantees' i ndependent evaluations (discus sed below) showed few detectable positive outcom es, many grantees now jud ge the cos ts of sustaining the interventions as too high. Th e two exceptions are Shar p HealthC are, which is maintaining its program despite the evaluation results, and Kaiser TriC entral, which, though not maintaining its intervention, is using what it learned from the three projects it implem ented to change how it provides care m anagem ent to frail elders and care for dem entia. In addition, there is som e potential for th e activities undertaken through Project IMPACT and UCLA GIM to be sustain ed. Despite the f act that m ost of the inte rventions have not been sustained, many have led to the developm ent of prom ising tools, such as the di abetes gu idelines created by UCLA GIM and th e techniques developed as part of the nationa l program s in which IOA and Project IMPACT participated. These tools m ay be of interest to others outside PEMC. Most grantees also perceived that there w ere less tangible benefi ts from their participation, including greater awareness of the needs of frail elders, contacts, and a better understanding of how to establish linkages between m edical and com munity-based organizations. 3. What Did the Individual Grantee Evalua tions Show to Be the Outcome s of th e Interventio ns? None of the five general care m anagem ent in terventions was shown to have statistica lly significant effects on the vast m ajority of outcomes, and the pattern of results does not otherw ise indicate that the projects had a positive (or negative) effect on those outcom es. (See Table 2 for outcom es results for general care m anagem ent pr ojects.) Ho wever, there were som e exceptions with respec t to particula r outcom es. Kaiser TriC entral's pro ject showed a significan t decline in depression for one clinical group that the evalua tors determ ined was not clinically relevant. Similarly, project, ther e was a signif icant increas e in ae robic activ ity and for the intervention group; those who were depr essed at the start of the intervention also experienced a decline in depression. In addition, at Sharp HealthCa re, participan ts with thre e or more lim itations in instrumental a ctivities of daily living experienced a significant reduction in nursing ho me use through the in tervention. However, because each p roject analy zed num erous outcom es, the few significant results that were f ound across all projects could be due solely to chance. Of the three com pleted diseas e-managem ent evaluations, only one (Project IMPACT) showed a reduction in depression as a result of the intervention, along w ith higher satisfaction with ca re, lo wer ra tes of functiona l impairm ent, a nd an incr ease in the quality of life. The other two projects (IOA and UCLA NPI) we re either not designed to test intervention ef fects direc tly xiii TABLE 2.

However, some of the early findings from these three interven tions suggest that one or m ore could have some prom ise. 4. What Explains the Lack of Positive Results? There are three pos sible flaws th at would ex plain why the interven tions were not m ore effective. Interven tions were flawed in (1) concept; (2 ) design an d measurem ent; or (3) execution. Reports evaluating each individual grantee were reviewed and program and foundation staff were consulted to discern what role each of thes e three factors m ay have played in the outcom es of PEM C. In the ind tions, resea rchers gave so me attentio n to the is sues of concept, design and m easurem ent, and execution, particularly with re gard to general case manage ment interventions, alt hough not necessarily in a syst ematic or uniform fashion. Unfortunately, the fact that the nature and in tensity of the interventions were not clearly specified by grantees in guideline s or in other detailed protocols makes it dif ficult to distingu ish between design and execution. The evidence suggests that weaknesses in both m ay have contributed, at leas t in part, to th e absence of more definitive outcom es and th at the absence of explicit protocols used by grantees to support the intervention itself coul d reflect a weakness in design. Program office and foundation staff reported a va riety of factors to explain the lack of positiv e outcom es from the inte rventions. In te rms of concept, it m ay have been u nrealistic to expect change in the kinds of fundam ental indicators exam ined. Pr ogram office staff noted tha t there was a lot of \"no ise\" in th e system . Because frailty has many di mensions, it m ay have be en unrealistic to expect that case m anagem ent and co mmunity-based services alone would be strong enough to \"move\" indictors in a way that would de monstrate to purchasers and plans that there could be a p ositive return on investm ent. In term s of design, staff said that one issu e may have com e from the fact that the intervention s did not incorpora te elem ents that motivate f rail patients to want to take advantage of services. In other words, it was p resum ptuous to believe th at patien ts will au tomatically take advantage o f new servic es. On the c ontrary, an interven tion will a ttract the targ et po pulation only if it is c reated to respon d to th eir concerns a nd needs. For instance, focusing on those in crisis may target r esources to those m ost likely to take advantage of the servic es. Furthermore, doing so through an intervention that draws in m edical staff and takes advant age of the trust they develop with their patients over time m ay make thos e in crisis m ore willing to a ccept he lp once they realize they need it. In evaluating execution, program office staff point ed out tha t there were m ajor challe nges in simultaneously satisfying the research need for a clear design and the practical needs of organization s deliv ering health care. For instan ce, clinicians and case m anagers trained to view each patien t as un ique m ay have trouble accepting a stand ard treatm ent pr otoco l, especially for patien ts with com plex needs. Therefore, deve loping support for an intervention m ay require methodological com promises that detract from its potential effectiven ess. Those approving grants, like the PEMC grants, typically have only a lim ited pool of applicants from which to choose. Moreover, there m ay be strong incentives in the applicant select ion process to take xv advantage of sponsor interest and resources in ways that build upon applicant interest and provide awards to proposals with shortcom ings, assum ing problem s can be dealt with later. The fact that PE MC focuses on frail elders, a group that m any regard as being insufficiently served by the existing system , raises the le vel of interest in an interventi on that would bene fit this group, even if the evidence base for how to intervene effectively is lacking, as it was in a num ber of ways when PEMC was launched and as it rem ains today. D. CONCL USIONS AND LESSONS 1. Conclusions PEMC was an am bitious program with a good ra tionale that produced m odest results. It appears to have been well run and financed by a foundation with a stron g, clear vision, and well supported by influential grantees , a program office, and an advi sory comm ittee th at aim ed to leverage the knowledge of the field. Why then did so few of the projects not lead to m ore m eaningful change in patient outcom es? In retrospect, the outcom es sought by PEMC were probably t oo lofty relative to the interventions tested, the speed with which they were deve loped, and the existing knowledge (when the program began) on how to both impr ove care for frail elde rs and finance those improve ments. PEMC's goal\u2014im proving care for frail elders\u2014was a challenging, but important, task. CHCF pursued the program for this reason and was encour aged by others to do so. The form of the intervention\u2014better communi cation that linked m edical and social service providers, w ith lim ited change in m edical practice \u2014was well suited to the cap itated e nvironm ent in California. The decision to look at external returns, in term s of health outcom es and costs, was based on the m arket. In the planning process, CH CF found evidence to suggest that plans would have a hard time accepting the results of any intervention and taking the next step without a business c ase for improving care to frail eld ers. However, PEMC grantees generally could not achieve this am bitious goal. In addition to the fact that th e goa ls were very am bitious, CHCF was probably not well position ed to achiev e them, since doing so wo uld m ean resolving wea knesses in d elivery that others before had failed to overcom e.5 For the most part, the im plem entation gran ts facilita ted the testing of a diverse set of general, but limited, case m anage ment m odels overlaid on a medical care system in which par ticipants were not asked to change v ery much in the way they practice. Furtherm ore, PEMC did not, for the mo st part, s eek to reo rganize th e entire deliv ery system . Rat her, the goal was to better link thes e medical s ystem s to comm unity-based social service providers and to introduc e more lim ited, but affordable, change (what Thornton, et al. (2002) term \"constrained innovation\").6 5 See, f or example, Davi d B.

Jan 2002. xvi Further, at the outset of PEMC, CHCF was a new foundation that aim ed to m ove quickly\u2014 probably m ore quickly than they were positioned to do effec tively. C HCF's decision to give grantees flexibility was an understandable respons e to grantees' interests in m ore flexible strategies that left m ore room for i nnovation th an did proscribed interventions. B ut flexibility also resulted in less emphasis than necessary or desirable in encouraging m aximum use of evidence in both struc turing the in terventions and defining the outcom es.7 The absence of a program office at the start of PEMC lim ited the support available to grantees. And, having only two cycles of closely spaced grants lim ited the am ount of learning that was availab le to im prove the program over tim e. In retrospect, it m ay have been m ore effective to invest in developing models before entering a large- scale test of the models. The PEMC experience is by no m eans atypical. En tities that fund interv entions often want strong evidence of positive effects fr om their invest ment, and they want that evidence relatively rapidly. Achieving organizational change is difficult, however. Seen in this light, program experience is a telling exam ple not only of how hard it is to e stablish inte rventions f or frail elde rs in a way tha t seriously changes th e care they r eceive but also of how much harder it is to do so while generating short-term savings. 2. Implica tions for Future Efforts to Improve Care to Frail Elders Experience with PEMC suggests that generali zed interventions focused on frail elders, if pursued, need to have realistic expectations of outcom es. For instance, it could be that im proving health outco mes in the traditional ways are inap propria te, at leas t for some frail elders who a re on an irreversible downward trajectory. In thes e cases, it m ay be that providing com fort in the way of caregiver and fam ily support is the best one can achieve. Or, when so m uch is lacking in terms of system s integration, m erely supporting efforts that im prove communication between medical providers and comm unity-based service provi ders m ay be valuable in itself , particu larly if it provide s the a ssura nce tha t effective interve ntions were not overlooked just because the need was not identified. The f act that these kinds of outcomes proba bly do not provide an immediately measurable return on investm ent does not m ean th at they are not valu able in o ther m eaningful ways. However it is unclear whet her payers, in today's environm ent, will support such \"soft\" interventions, which do not generate a hard m easurable return on investm ent. An altern ative appro ach is to try to apply som e of the lessons o f disease-f ocused intervention s to constru ct interven tions f or frail elders that work better. For instance, one could develop interventions directed to frail elders at particula r points of vulnerability (f or exam ple, when they are in transition from one setting of ca re to another, or durin g hospitalization) or for particular events or conditions (s uch as falls, dementia, or depression). Su ch an app roach m ay be focused enough so that evidence-based protocols can be developed and resources can be directed to the patients who are m ost ready to accept h elp and to the situation s for which inte rvention s could be m ost cost-effective. W hat appear to be prom ising results from Project IMPACT and the UCLA NPI interventions sugge st that this st rategy m ay have som e potential. 7 Chen, Arnold, Randall Brown, Nancy Archibald, Sherry Aliotta and Peter Fox \"Best Practices in Coordinated 2000. xvii More fundam entally, it m ay be that m eaningful changes in care outcom es require efforts to reorganize care system s so that they are m ore responsive to the needs of chronically ill patients, particularly those with multiple c onditions and who are frail as well.8 This approach is essentially based on the conclusion that lim ited interven tions yield limited resu lts and that th e emphasis, therefore, needs to b e on more m assive change. Unfortunately, while such m ajor system redesign m ay be valuable, the environm ent is such that m assive change in financial incentives a nd in how institu tions relate to one another are not lik ely to be f orthco ming in the immediate future, ex cept perhap s in uniquely appropriate and auspicious circum stances. 3. Lessons for Efforts to Improve Care Coordination in Medicare The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) requires chronic care to be a foc us of private plans in Medicare Adva ntage and of the traditional Me dicare program . A large pilo t program concentrating on coordi nated care has been auth orized with ambitious goals with respect to both scope and outcom es.9 CMS is also like ly to rem ain interested in de monstration s that addr ess the needs of frail eld ers join tly eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and such demonstrations could provide an opportunity to in itiate m ore funda mental change in system s. The experience of the Program for Elders in Managed Care underscores the im portance of well-s tructured, evidence-based in terventions to successf ul outcom es the particular challenges associated with and effec tively im plem enting these interv entions for frail elders. It is not clear from PEMC whether the interven tions to be inclu ded f ederal pilo ts will be adeq uately scaled to the ambitious policy goals s et for them , particular ly giv en the spe ed with which they ar e likely to be pur sued and th e lim ited sc ope of their author ity (especially for interventions outside provider system s). Like PE MC, the federa l pilo t may be expecting m ore than incremental change can deli ver in im proved outcom es of care. It is unclear how m uch support for frail eld ers will be forth coming from the federal pilo ts. Experience suggests that it is eas ier to develop interventions fo r relatively healthy people who can larg ely care for them selves but who have chr onic care needs. Thus, it is possible that the pilots will h ave an ince ntive to f ocus less on e lders with ill-def ined co nditions and larger c are manage ment needs than on other populations. If true, an important opportunity to improve care for frail eld ers may be lost. In addition, beca use frail elders account for a large p roportion of 8 Wagner, Ed H, B rian T. Aust in, Connie Davis, M ike Handmarsh, Judith Schaefe r, and Am y -78, November/December 01. 9 The three-year p ilots will in volve contracts with private sector organization s that ag ree t o develop coordinated care pilots involving ei ther ca re managem ent or di sease m anagem ent that target a po pulation in a given region. CMS envi sions contracting wi th organizations t hat agree to ri sk their fee on the res ults they achieve. Involved staff believe that a fiv e percent savin gs over three years is realistic. Ou tcomes will b e assessed based on the total population targete d, not just those reache d by the intervention.

INTRODUCTION AND B ACK GROUND The Program for Elders in Manag ed Care was a five-year, $15 m illion program funded by the California HealthCare Foundation. Establ ished in 1997, PEMC a imed to i mprove care delive ry for frail, at-r isk elders in Me dicar e managed care. The first of CHCF's grant program s, PEMC encouraged partnerships between m anaged care organizations, provider organizations, and community-based organizations. The hope was that these integrated m odels of care would not only enhance access, but also improve care c oordination for this vuln erable population. In pursuing these ends, f oundation staff noted that they received encour agem ent from other foundations and groups who perceived the value of focusing on frail elders overall, not just the manage ment of specific diseases. W ith interest growing nationwide on how best to improve care delivery for frail elders, both policym akers and c linicians, in California and nationwide, have great interest in PEMC and what lessons it m ay have for future efforts to improve care to frail elders. To address this need, this report summ arizes the results of the evaluation of PEMC that was comm issioned by CHCF and conducted by Mathem atica Policy Research, Inc. The initial chapter provides a brief background on the program . (See Appendix A for more inform ation on the evaluation and program background.) This chap ter also describes th e MPR evaluation and outlin es the organiz ation and overa ll purpose of the repor t. A. OVERVIEW OF PEMC PROGRAM PEMC's goal was to improve care f or frail eld ers in Medicare m anaged care in California. Calif ornia h as always le d the na tion in its a doption of Medicare m anage d care (Gold and Lake 2002). In 1997, when PEMC was developed, it looked like m anaged care would becom e incre asingly dom inant in care for the elderly, not just in Californi a, but also in the nation as a whole (Zaraboza, Taylor and Hicks 1996; Christensen 1998). The Program for Elders in Managed Care aim ed to inf luence the f ragmented way in which frail elders receive care by forging links between MCOs , provider organizations, and community-based service providers. However, PEMC was m ore than just a co mmunicatio n program . Successful in terventions would face th e challenges associated with bridg ing the divers e outlooks of m edical and social se rvices providers and with the constraints of Medicare and its largely m edically oriented benefits. PEMC was based around two cycles of compet itive gr ants. Grantee s were requ ired to represent a coalition of m anaged care organizations, health care providers, and community-based organizations. The PEMC solicitation was relative ly broad to encourage diverse m odels, whil e also providing a m echanism for key constituenc ies to collabo rate on effective ways of addressing program goals. Several types of grants were funded\u2014im plementation, planning, and related activities. Implementation grants were desi gned to support efforts to de velop new system s of care that aimed to improve care or service delivery for fra il elders in m anaged care; those receiving such grants were awarded up to $1 m illion for a period of up to three ye ars. They were r equired to 1 include an independent evaluation with, in m ost cases, a random ized design as a core part of the project. Planning grants were sm aller and were intended to serv e as \"seed m oney\" to further develop arrangem ents that were still at the fo rmative stage. These g rantees received up to $75,000 for a period of up to one year. Aside f rom the grants awarded during the two funding cycles, PEM C also m ade or served to oversee o n an ad hoc basis a few \"related -activity\" grants for activities with sim ilar objectives to PEMC; two of the grants funded under this initiative focused on disease m anagem ent program s for thos e with depression and diabetes. In total, PEMC sponsored nine im plementation grants, thirteen planning gran ts, and three related- activ g rants; it a lso provided au gmentation moni es to th ree of the implem entation grants to support add itional analysis. (See Appendix B (Table B.1) for a complete lis t of grants ; see Appendix C for summ aries of each planning grants.) CHCF initially adm inistered PEMC, but, in October 1999, the Foundation es tablis hed a separate p rogram office at th e University of California at Los Ange les (UCLA) Multicam pus Program for Geriatrics and Gerontology for this purpose. The program office was responsible for overseeing the grants, providing te chnical assistance to g rantees, and d issem inating the re sults from program activities. PEMC also had a 12 -member advisory comm ittee that was responsib le for reviewing grant applicati ons, attending the annual m eetings , and offering guidance to the program office. The adv isory committee cons isted of experts in m anaged care and care for th e elderly, both in California and nationally. Because the chair of the orig inal advisory board was tapped to co-direct the program office, the offi ce benefited from the early program experience. PEMC's goals were ambitious. T he populati on it sought to target\u2014f rail elders\u2014tend to have m any chronic conditions that typically are not adequately addr essed by a health care system focused on acute treatm ent and service (Anderson and Knickm an 2001; Partnership for Solutions 2002). At the tim e PEMC was developed, m ost proposed innovations we re \"fairly cautious experim ents\" (Boult, K ane, Pacala, and W agner 1999). B y and large, their ob jectives were constrained\u2014to \"fix\" one part of health care de livery (for exam ple, using team s and redesigning prim ary care)\u2014not the overall system. Articles high lighting the lim itations of single intervention change and potential alternatives , like th e chronic care model, we re just starting to em erge (Wagner, Austin, and Von Korff 1996). Even now, few care provider s use the kinds of comprehensive approaches believed to be i mportant for i mproving care to frail elders and others with chron ic illn esses (Casolino, et al. 2003). PEMC sought to address th ese prob lems, at leas t in part. It also sought to build an evidence ba se, through the rigorous individual grantee evaluations, that could infor m future efforts. The context in which P EMC was developed is important to keep in m ind in judging the program . (See Appendix E for an annotated bibliogr aphy of selected resear ch on this topic.) The task of reconfiguring care system s for frail elders with diverse disabilities, chronic illnesses, and cognitive impairm ents is substantially m ore chal lenging than that involved in im proving care to relatively healthy peop le with particula r con ditions tha t are often targ eted by disea se managem ent program s and quality improvem ent initiatives. Program s with proven e ffectiveness in interven ing to im prove care for frail eld ers are rare, even today. Furtherm ore, efforts at intervention are challenged by the expense of interventions, regulatory requirem ents, paye r restrictions, and the attitudes of existing pr oviders (Boult, Kane, Pa cala, and Wagner 1999). While PEMC's goals w ere not so lo fty as to req uire all thes e challenges to be addressed, barriers were encountered. In addition, the program spanned the period during which the m anaged care 2 backlash developed, and Medicare m anaged care pl ans saw reductions in the rate at which their federal capitation paym ents increas ed. Plans and providers participating in PEMC were not immune to these influences, and their results crea ted organ izationa l instab ility tha t had a negative effect on som e of the PEMC grante e coalition s. B. EVALUATION OF PEMC In late 2002, CHCF commissioned MPR, base d on a competitive process, to evaluate the overall program experience of PEMC. The MP R evaluation addresses six key questions: 1. What kinds of integrated m odels of care fo r frail elders we re tested through PEMC? 2. What has been learned about grantees' di fferent m odels of care? What were the outcom es of the individual gr ants, and how did they vary? 3. Which de monstration efforts appeared m ost sustainable or applicable to other settings ? What are the factors that lead to, or impede, the s uccess of different m odels of care? 4. What are th e nationwid e implicatio ns of findings for care m anage ment, managed care practices, Medicare policy, or care for frai l elders? 5. Generally, what has been learned about gran t making in the area of integrated care for the elderly, or in general? What is the va lue and use of pla nning grants? How did the related-activ ities th e program 's mission? Would these outcom es have com e from the m arket withou t the benefit of foundation funding? 6. What can we learn about program office operations? W hich program office activities have been perceived to be m ost useful and least useful, and why? What are the lessons for the m anage ment of other program s? Given the resources availab le, and at the Foundation 's request, th e evaluation b uilt on inform ation already available on PEMC, especially the evalu ations built into each pro ject grant. The MPR evaluation included four basic methods and sources of infor mation: 1. A review of program /grantee applications , progress reports, and final reports. 2. A synthesis of findings from grantee reports o f evaluati ons of outcomes, m ost of which included a random ized control design. 3. Independent sem istructured interviews with grantees and other program participant s using sem istructured protocols.10 10 For implementation grants, MPR in terviewed the lead organizatio n for the grant, on e staff m ember fro m another organizational participant (such as a com munity-base d organization), and the internal eva luator. For planning grants, one interview was conducted per grant. 3 4. A review of the r elated litera ture on e fforts to im prove care for fr ail elders and others through dem onstrations and other m eans. To provide context, MP R also observed the PE MC grantee program meeting for th e final year and the ass ociated Leadership Su mmit and review ed re levant lite rature on other applicable initiatives and findings nationwide. (See A ppendix F for addition al details on m ethods.) C. ORGANI ZATION OF THIS REP ORT This report provides the overall findings from MPR's evaluation. Chapter II focuses on the core of the program \u2014the experience of the i mplem entation grants. The chapter describes the differe nt models of care funded by th e grants, including the im petus behind their developm ent. The chapter then desc ribes MPR 's findings on im plementation grants from reviewing docum ents and conducting interv iews. These findings focus on the im petus for participation, problem s encountere d, and the the ted.11 To enrich the findings, this analys is includes not only the experience of the nine im plem entatio n grants, bu t also tha t of the two related -activity grants tha t resulted in operational dem onstrations. (See Ta ble I.1 for a list of PEMC grante es by type.) Two of the nine implem entation gran ts were te rminated bef ore they were operational; for these grants, the reasons for lack of success are reviewed, but obviously no data on operational outcom es are included. T he chapter then summarizes what th e grantees' own evaluations found, including assessing the design of the studies that generated those outcom es. The chapter ends b y assess ing project findings in context of existing research in this area. Chapter III presents evaluation results on ot her program components, including: (1) what was accomplished by including p lanning gran ts and flex augm ented analysis; (2) MPR's conclusions on th e value of funding rigorous individual grantee evaluations as an integ ral part of the dem onstration; (3) the findings on program adm inistration and infrastructure; (4) the program 's success in meeting its dissem ination objectives; and (5) the lessons for future programming. Chapter IV builds on the findings and presents overall conclusions of the evaluation and lessons to be drawn from thes e findings/conclusions. The latter includes targeted lessons for CHCF and California hea lth plans and providers, and m ore ge neral lessons for improving care to frail elders. 11 MPR's findings in this area are se parat e from those o f Randi S. Jones a nd others i n the program office w ho also interviewed implementation grantees. Th eir an alysis us ed computer-assisted qualitativ e analysis to g enerate ten themes relev ant for others seeking lesson s from PEMC.

FINDINGS FROM THE EVALUATION OF IMPLEMENTATI ON GRANTS This chapter presents the key findings from the evaluation of the im plementation grants, the core of PEMC. The structure of each grant is described and MPR's evaluation findings are presented in the following areas: (1) m otivation for grantees to get involved in the demonstration; (2) grantees' progress in im plem enting initiatives; (3) the technical and other problem s encountered by grantees; and (4) grantee accom plishm ents under the p rogram and whether they have been sustaine d. Next is a review of how grants were structured to support their independent evaluation of project outcom es and what thes e evaluation findings show. The chapter ends with a brief analys is of how thes e findings compare to thos e reported elsewhere in the literature for sim ilar program s. (See Appendi x C for a s ummary of each grant that in cludes inform ation on grant design, im plem entation experience, structure of evaluation, and key findings.) A. GRANT STRUCTURE PEMC's implem entatio n grants w ere structured to provide gran tees with f lexibility in designing strategies for im proving care for frail elders. (See Table II.1 for a summ ary of the PEMC-funded and related-activity grants.) The l ead sponsors of the nine PEMC i mplem entation grants were a diverse group. Three were managed care plans (K aiser TriCentral, Pacificare/S ecure Horizons, and On Lok Senior Health Services) ; thre e were com munity-base d groups (JFC S, IOA, and CIRHM); one was a provi der group (Sharp HealthCare); one was an academ ic group (UCLA NPI); and one was an orga nization (LTCG) consulting for CalPERS, a purchaser. Seven of the nine im plementation grants focused on general care m anagem ent for frail elders, although two of them never achieved operational status (CIRHM and On Lok Senior Health Serv ices). The fiv e that d id achiev e operational status include the following: Jewish Family and Children' s Ser vices. The target population was high-risk seniors receiving care from physici ans affiliated with the Br own and Toland Medical Group. Building on a 1993 pilot, physicians and front -office staff identified seniors who m ay have needed supportive services and referred them to a caseworker at JFCS for an in- home assessm ent, including appropriate s ubsequent referrals and services. F ront- office staff at Brown and Toland received tr aining to iden tify those appropriate for referra l. Kaiser TriC entral. The target population was high-risk seniors in the Kaiser southern Calif ornia s ystem . This grante e teste d whether high-risk seniors who received hom e and comm unity-b ased s ervices as a Kaiser ben efit for th ree m onths would see the value of and be willing to pay for these services late r. Usi ng a random ized design with two rounds of random ization, Kaiser TriCentral tested four options: (1) usual care with mailed inf a nd erral; (2) ge riatric care m anagem ent with $2,000 in addition al ben efits; and (4 ) lim ited telephonic cas e manage ment. 6 TABLE II .1: PROFILE OF IMP LEMENTATIO N GRANTS AN D SIMILAR RELATED-ACTIVITIES GRANTS Grantee Lead Organization Type Other Collabor ators Focus Targe t Population Interven tion Hypothesized Outcomes Comme nt Jewish Family and Children's Services Com munity - based organization Brown & Toland Medical Group;

Sharp HealthCare. The target population was chronica lly ill Medicare patients in the Sharp HealthCare system in San Diego who are enrolled in PacifiCare. These senio rs were random ly assigned to receive intensiv e case m anagem ent or standard m edical manage ment. In the form er, case managers re view screen ing resu lts, receive referrals from primary care physicians, and monitor service-use data to identify at-risk cases for the primary care physician. Patients were eligible for, though not required to get, integrated m edical/social case m anagem ent including in-hom e visits as required.

The target population of this long-term care insurance provider was Sacram ento seniors in CalP ERS with long-term care insurance who have at least one chronic condition and who receive care through one of three managed c are plans (Kaiser Perm anente, Health Net, or Pacif iCare). Those random ized to the intervention group m et with a nurse hea lth coach who worked with them to develop a plan that includ ed diet and exercise, d isease m anagem ent, and referral to c ommunity servic es. PacifiCare/Secure Horizons. The target group was elders age 85 and older and other seniors id entified as frail in three m edical groups affiliated with PacifiCare. Those random ized to the intervention group were s een by a Care Advocate (a m aster's-level 9 care m anager) in a co mmunity care center who assessed need for eight types o f services, m ade appropriate referrals, and did follow-up. The prim ary care provider was updated on the patient's progress. The other tw o implementation grants (IOA and UC LA NPI), described below, are specific to dementia. Institu te on Aging. The target population was senior s with Alzheim er's disease in three very different provider groups (Kaiser Perm anente Northern Calif ornia, Brow n and Toland Medical Group, Sutter Health). This grant invo lved both the use of new instrum ents for assessing de mentia and m odel treatm ent protocols for providing patient inform ation and fa mily caregiver suppor t. The effort was part of a seven-site nationa l initiative of the Alzheim er's A ssociation and the National Chronic Care Consortium . UCLA Neuropsychiatric Ins titute. The target population was seniors with Alzheim er's disease (and th eir caregivers) receiving care through one of three medical groups in San Diego (Kaiser Perm anente, Scripps Clinic, and UC San Diego HealthCare). The grantee tested guidelines for dem entia care that were developed by a task force of providers and community ag encies. Clinics within the p rovider group s were random ized to the intervention gr oup (using guidelines) or control group. Both relate d-activities grants supp orted d isease-spec ific in terven tions, one on depression (Projec t IMPACT) and one on d iabetes (UCLA GIM).12 These projects were funded on an ad hoc basis from available funds on an opportunistic basis when the Foundation received outside requests that they saw to be related to PEMC goals. Project IM PACT. The target population was elders age 60 and older diagnosed with depress ion and receiv ing care throug h the Kaiser Hayward medical site o r the Desert Medical Group. Those random ized to the trea tment group received specialized care manage ment for depression from a clinical specialist in dep ression who coordinated care and acted as the interface between the patient and phys ician. CHCF funds allowed these two sites to be part of a national study that included five other sites and a coordinating center f unded by the Hart ford Foundation.

The guidelines are n ow being pilot tes ted in two locations: Sharp HealthCare (San Diego) and W est Los A ngeles Veterans Affa irs Med ical Center. Related funding was provided to the RAND Corporation to de velop a tool to predict risk of m ortality and decline in order to help target support. The im plementation grants serving f rail elders genera lly inv e types n and initial assessm ent; (2) develop ment of a care plan ; and (3) im plem entation of that care plan. Although each grantee used som e form of identification, their m ethods varied, and some interventions focused on m ore frail elders than did others.13 Once id entified, clie nts were assessed and care m anagem ent was provided. Th e most atypical interventions targeting the general frail elder population were in Kaiser TriCentral and LTC G. The for mer em phasized the effects of benefit expansion fo r hom e and community services, wh ile the latter s ought to prom ote exercise and lifesty le ch ange prim arily for he althy seniors who had pur chased lon g-term care insurance. Disease- specific inte rventions use d a imilar of activ ities but f ocused on assessm ent and care for specific co nditions and placed m ore emphasis on adherence to m edical practice gu idelines.14 Although the type of organization ac ting as the lead differed across the grants, all o f the im plem entation g rants were s tructured to draw on t he incentives of r isk-based managed ca re. The interventions focused on those enrolled in risk -based m anaged care plan s under the assum ption that, by virtue of capitation, the plan and a ssociated risk-based providers would have an interest in flexible delivery of care and in working with community-base d organizations that offered potential cost savi ngs and im proved patient outcom es. The hom e- and community-based service organizati ons involved in the grants varied from project to project but genera lly of fered such s ervices as transporta tion, in-hom e services (including m eals), and social- work counseling. In a few cases, comm unity organizations were the lead entities in the grants, holding prim ary responsibility for establishing the care m anage ment approaches and linkages with MCOs. Exam ples of linkages or the following: Kaiser TriCentral partnered with L os Angeles County and the City of Los Angeles Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs), whic h provide hom e- and community-based services to the elderly. 13 Fou r of the five grantees u sed adm inistrative dat a, with two basing identification on use-based algorithms (Kaise r TriCentral and Pacifi care/Secure Horizons) on number ch ronic conditions ( Sharp Heal thCare and LTC G). The fifth, JFCS, did not use a formal set of criteria; the primary method of screeni ng was by telephone. 14 Three of the four disease-s pecific projects (UCL A GIM , UCLA NPI, and IOA) involved gene ral guidelines calling for the development and implementation of a treatment plan that included defined goals for the patient to attain . Th e UCLA GIM intervention, for instance, involved develop ment and pilot testin g of a set of evidence-based guidelines, which include d specific ca re re commendations con cerning health conditions a ssociate d with diabetes . Although the IOA in tervention emphasized adherence to sp ecific practice gu idelines, it was sim ilar to the general care m anagement projects in t hat re ferral s to c ommunity -based se rvices that a ddressed dementia played an important role. Th e Pro ject IMPACT in terven tion, rath er than using specific g uidelines, atte mpted to standardize care by training clinical depression specialists, who perform ed the care man agement according to an in tervention manual used for all in tervention sites . 11 IOA partnered with an operational risk-b ased MCO and provide r (Kaise r and Brown and Toland Medical Group) a nd with local chapters of the Alzheim er's Association. PacifiCare/S ecure Horizons partnered w ith four m edical groups (Cedars Sinai, Harrim an Jones, HealthCare Partners, a nd Talbert), and two hom e- and community- based service organizations (Jewish Fa mily Service of Los Angeles and JFCS of Long Beach/W est Orange County). JFCS of Sa n Francisco partnered with Br own and Toland Medical Group in order to identify frail elders who had been seen in prim ary practices in the group; Brown and Toland referred patients to JFCS for care insurance who could benefit from pers onal health coaching led by Eskaton. As part of the goal of better coordinating m edical and social services for frail eld ers, an important e mphasis of the gran t pro jects was to facilitate the relation ships between m edical and social service organizations. Partnerships and closer working relationships were intended to support the interventions tested in the dem onstrations (as described in Section C of this chapter). Related -activity gr ants were not r equired to involve comm unity-based organizations. The intensity of the interventions varied am ong im plementation grants. For exam ple, som e grantees conducted the initial assessm ent by telephone (Sharp H ealthCare and Pacificare/Secure Horizons), while others did so in person (L TCG and JFCS).15 Kaiser TriCentral used both methods to test m ultiple interventions. The in itial assessm ents for the disease-specific interventions were all conducted in person. The extent of enrollee contact also varied. For exam ple, care advocates in the Pacificare/S ecure Horizons projec t contacted patients m onthly for el even months af ter the initial assessm ent; the geriatric case m anager of the Kaiser TriCentral intervention devoted 20 hours, on average, to each case o ver an eigh t- to nine-m onth period. In the Sharp H ealthCare project, care manage ment began with \"active\" status patie nts being contacted monthly or weekly and transitioned to \"m onitoring\" stat us (usua lly after the first 90 days), in which contacts were initiated every 60 to 90 days. Staffing als o varied. T hree pro jects (Kaiser TriCentral, P acificare/Se cure Horizo ns, and Sharp HealthCare) em ployed eith er regis tered n urses or staf f with a m aster's degree in social work or family counseling. Staff in the other two care m anagem ent projects typically had lower levels of training. Those with a bachelor's degr ee were trained to be nur se health coaches in LTCG intervention, and physician office staff were trai ned to be geriatric resource persons in the JFCS project. Kaiser TriCentral also used b achelor's level staffing in one form of its intervention. Project IMPACT, on the other hand, em ployed clinical depression specialists, who were either psychologists or psychiatric nurses. 15 If it was deemed necessary, an initial in -home asse ssmen t was con ducted for the Sharp Health Care and Pacificare/Sec ure Horiz ons interventions. 12 In accord ance with th e grant requirem ents, all of the im plem entation grants involv ed some type of partnership with comm unity-based se rvice providers . (See box below for an illus trative exam ple of how this w orked for one patient.) In som e cases, the partnership took the form of referra ls to community-based se rvice provide rs, and in other cases, community providers were more closely involved in the overall design and m anage ment of the intervention. As part of the care m anagem ent interventions, Kaiser TriCentral and Pacificare/Secure Ho rizons made referrals to a wide range of community-b ased services, such as food de livery, transportation services, adult day health services, or le gal assistance. While Pacificare/S ecure Horizons did this through only a few organizations, Kaiser TriCentral contracted with many. IOA and LTCG either partne red d irectly with or referred pa tients to community-based organ izations for s ervices related to outcom e. The IOA grant, which targ eted the needs of dem entia patients, referred patients to the local chapter of the Alzheim er's Association to s upport and educate to effe ctive at chronic dise ase self-m anagem ent\u2014partnered directly with a community-based organization to provide services , such as fitness clas ses and chronic diseas e self-m anagem ent. An E xample of Care Management Mrs. M., an 85-year-o ld widow was ph ysically frail, lived alone in a sm all ap artment, used oxygen 24 hours a day , and walked with the aid of a wal ker. No longer able to drive, she felt \"cooped up\" and depe ndent. Her daughter, who lived 30 minutes away and worked full time, took her grocery shopping and helped with house keeping chores on the weeke nd. Concerne d that she was a b urden to her daughter, Mrs. M. enrolled in the Care Advo cate Prog ram. After th e initial assessm ent, Mrs. M d ecided to enroll in only th e Dial-A-Lift transportatio n services. Mrs. M. u sed the serv ice regularly for shop ping, getting to h er doctor's appoin tments, and going to the bank. After nine months in the program, Mrs. M. was diagnosed with end-stage liver ca ncer. Because Mrs. M was not a ca ndidate for cancer treatm ent, the ca re advoca te discus sed hospice options with Mrs . M. and he r family and refe rred he r bac k to their medical group. Aft er the fam ily discusse d end-of-life opt ions with Mrs. M's physician, she was tran from the hospi tal to a hospi ce-care cente r, where she died with in a week. Soon after, the care advocate received a letter fr om Mrs. M.'s daughter t hanking her for providi ng emotional support and for introducing Mrs. M. to transportation that offered her a \"feeling of indepe ndence al l the way until the end of her life.\" (Wilber and Shannon 2003) The extent of physician involvem ent also varied across grantees. For exam ple, of the five general interventions, two appeared to have involved physicians on a lim ited basis, such as through a telephone discussion of th e initial assessm ent results (JFC S) or a letter from the care advocate (P acificare/Secure Horizo ns). B. MPR'S EVALUATION FINDI NGS MPR's evaluation was based on docum ent review and interviews and thus com plements the assessm ent of outcom es in the individual grantee evalu ations. This section reviews what MPR learn ed gran tees' motivation s for becom ing invo lved the p rogram, the a bility of the grantees to move forwa rd to im plem entation, the problem s experienced in doing so, what the grants accomplished, and what is known about the sustainab ility of the interventions. 13 1. What Motivated Gran tees to Become Involved in PEMC? For the m ost part, th e impetus for grantees' p articipation in PEMC seem ed to reflect the convergence of three forces: (1) a local \"cham pion\" who had heard of th e grant opportunity and who was interested in developing an initiative an d ready to ta ke the lead on it; (2) m anagem ent's perception that the kind of ini tiative envisioned would be to th e advantage of the organization and consistent with its mission and b usiness interests; and (3) broad awareness of th e CHCF call for proposals for PEMC and applicant interest. In general, local champions had a three-pronged role: Th ey created awarenes s of th e potential to move forwa rd with a particular ini tiative, served as comm unicato rs and negotiato rs across th e diverse o rganizations and constitu encies th at had to be brought on board for a particular project, and moved th e implem entation process f orward. Specifically, however, this role differed across gran tees, and the decision to proceed with i mplem entation appea red to have been m ore of an issu e in som e setting s than in others. LTCG interven tion would never have b een developed without the active inte rest of a key consultant with in LTCG who saw PEMC as a n opportunity to propose a different kind of project . The consultant knew that launching this project would m ean convincing CalPERS of its n eed and identifying an appropriate partner to mount the behavior-based intervention. In contra st, there was less convincing necessary at On Lok Senior Health Serv ices where the cham pion was the C EO. Also, it was easier to cham pion projects that built on prior dem onstr ations (JFC S, for example) o r on existing wor k in an a rea (such as Kaiser TriCen tral's wo rk to identify frail elders ). A business rationale for proceed ing was im portant for all g rantees, reg ardles s of ty pe. For health plans, the rationale stemm ed from reco gnition of the challenges involved in delivering care to a growing frail elderly population. This was variously expr essed as a desire to im prove links with comm unity-based organizations, asse ss th e pote ntial for rea ching out to those not served, or identify potential innovations and ne w services. Community groups leading grant developm ent typically cited the value of the PEMC grant in providing a vehicle to further develop existing commun ity-b ased initiatives.16 Provider groups cited the potential to im prove care, though at leas t one noted that physicians would have to be pers uaded that participation would not lim it their ability to m aintain clinic al control ov er medical care . Feedback from those successful in getting im plem entation grants suggests that knowledge of the opportunities presented by the solicitation was widespread. This may have been connected to the fact that there were m any ways to learn about the solicitati on, aside from mail. For instance, several grantees knew CHCF staff a nd heard about the ca ll for proposals through them . Some potential grantees were active in the advisory bo ard for the solicitation and heard of it that way. CHCF appe ars to have gone out of its way to in form dom inant health care system s and providers about the opportunity. While MPR does not have a sense of the level of awareness am ong those who never applied or did not obta in grants, the explanations about awareness from those who did obtain grants suggest that knowledge of the opportunity presented by PEMC was widespread. 16 Historically, program offi ce st aff say , getting res ources from health plans has been a major issue for community-b ased organizatio ns. Community o rganization s thus hoped PEMC wou ld show positive outcomes valued by plans that would make plans more likely to pay community-based organizations i n the future. 14 The process leading to related grant awards or awards for activity that was part of national demonstrations was different from the pro cess for awarding PEMC-funded grants. California grantees receiving related-activit y grants to participate in P roject IMPACT learned about PEMC through their work with the Hartford Foundatio n on th e national initiative. Includin g multiple California sites reflects CHCF's interest in producing findings that could be generalized beyond the Kais er model. UCLA GIM's diabetes initiative was encour aged b y fellow faculty at th e PEMC program office, and CHCF encouraged UCLA to use a nati onal advisory pa nel to build support for the findings. PEMC support for JFCS was enhanced by JF CS's experience with a Robert W ood Johnson Foundation grant. The decis ion to app ly directly for an im plem entation grant versus a planning grant appears to have been a strategic one that was relevant only to Cycle 1 grantees, as it was well known that Cycle 2 would be the las t of the grant cycles. So me grantees that were un certain of their concep t wanted or needed such a grant to ex plore the feas ibility of their concep t. Those going straigh t to an im plementation grant som etimes did so because they we re fearful that to do o therwise would mean that they would never progr ess to an implem entatio n grant. (In Cycle 2, this was a h igh probability, since no additional grants were an ticipated.) Others either felt they had done enough developm ent work that they were ready for im plem entation or found the concept of planning grants not very useful. At least one grantee that went stra ight to an im plem entation grant lea rned later that its system s were not as developed as it had thought and said, in hindsight, that it would have benef ited f rom addition al tim e to plan. A nother sa id a planning gr ant would have helpe d them to \"hit the ground running.\" 2. Were Gran tees Able to Implement the Interventions? All of the grantees appear to have m ade a good faith effort to implement the initiatives they proposed. In a few ca ses, they modified thei r design to address unan ticipated problem s or unexpected issues that arose. In interviews and through observations at program meetings, the enthusiasm and comm itment of the PE MC participants was very obvious. Of the nine im plementation grants, seven beca me fully operational; however, one of the seven (JFCS) was able to recruit only six patients for its intervention group. JCFS attributes the failure to th e instab ility in the m arket. Specif ically, the inte rvention wa s based on a collaboration with m edical groups affiliated with Brown and Toland Medical Group. Brown and Tolan d reportedly stopped accepting full -risk contracts, which m eant that they no longer had an incentive to partic ipate in the dem onstra tion as they would not benefit from any s avings that might result. Brown and Toland Medical Group sent patients a letter saying care m anage ment servic es wer e cance led. Despite its e fforts, JFCS could not encourage physic ians t o refer. Si nce the intervention depended on physicians and their o ffice staff referring patie nts, this m eant that the intervention ultim ately could not be tested. In the abs ence of a rando mized trial, JCFS used both a retrospective analysis of health outcom es and costs for those voluntarily using services, versus those who did not use serv ices, and a qu alitative ass essment of the ef fective ness of the training for physician office staff. External events appear to have been responsib le for the inability of On Lok Senior Health Services an d CIRHM to proceed to operation al status. O n Lok Senior Health S ervices, the nationally recognized impetus for the PACE program , hoped to use it s grant to expand the reach of its program to those who preferred to keep their own prim ary care physicians while accessing 15 the extensive set of On Lok Seni or Health Services s upport services. Unsure about whether this model would work, On Lok first sought a planni ng grant to explore with community physicians the f easib ility of forming a netwo rk. W ith the implementation grant, On Lok Senior Health Services began patient recruitm ent, attracting 12 to 14 of the 40 or so individuals it sought to attract. Unfortunately, despite what appear to have been extens ive discussions with state and federal agencies in its planning, On Lok Senior Health Services was asked by HCFA to stop recru itment based on th e fact that there were n ew rules prohibiting PACE de monstrations from using con tracted physicians. Given HCFA's ru ling, CHCF becam e concerned abou t the lengthy delay in im plem entatio n and officially term inated th e gran t in April 2 002. (HCFA ultim ately approved a waiver for On Lok Senior Health S ervices, and the program was relaunched in July 2002; 46 active enrollees were re ported as of m id-August 2003.) The reasons f or the early term ination of the CIRHM grant are m ore complex. In m any ways, the gran t faced challenges unique to a rural area, where m anaged care has historically had trouble thriving (MedPAC 2002). Under the grant, Lom poc Valley Comm unity Healthcare Organization, a comm unity health organization with 67 m embers, sought to introduce care m anagem ent for seniors. The organization worked to create a managed care plan based around a m ajor IPA group of physicians participating in Pa cifiCare's Secure Horizons pr oduct. U nfortunately, PacifiCare decided that the risk -based m odel it used with the IPA did not work in this market. I t was reported that care for tw o very sick patien ts cost the IPA $2 m illion, leaving it b ankrupt. As an alternative, PacifiCare contract ed with physicians individually a nd later developed a risk-based contract with providers in a nearby town. Thi s move resulted in the loss of one -third of the antic ipated participan ts for the demonstration. Concerned that it would not b e able to m eet its comm itments, CIRHM notified CHCF about the change and the Foundation ultim ately decided to terminate the contrac t. 3. What Technical Problems Did Grantees En counter, and How Did They Resolve Them? The grantees' ability to move forwa rd with th eir inte rventio ns was influ enced by a num ber of factors\u2014som e more easily controlled than ot hers. Each grantee enc ountered challenges, as would be expected given the type s of interventions be ing introduced. T he nature of the problem and the extent of its ultim ate impact on i mplementation varied across grantees. (See Table II.2 for infor various implem entation and environm ental challenges.) Delays Resulting from Institution al Review Board Approval. Four of the nine grantees said that gaining IRB approval for their work w as a challen ge tha t resulted in ex tensive d elays and frustration, particularly in a few projects. Obtaining IRB a pproval was especially dem anding for m any grantees b ecause the nature of the inte rventions and collabo rations m eant that approval was require d from multiple institu tional re view boards. The Institute on Aging's projec t, for exam ple, required approval from four IRBs. Gran tee s taff characterized this requ irement as a \"nightm are.\" The UCLA GIM diabetes project involved approval from three IR Bs; approval took six m onths rather than the two anticipated. An insider who knew a bout ways to facilitate the process (such as sequencing the steps in the appr oval pro cess in the o rder m ost likely to be effective) helped at least one gr antee avoid delays. In a provider-based orga nization, a ruling that the pro ject was a qua lity im provem ent projec t rather than a clinical tr ial also expedited the process. For another grantee, a prior planning gr ant helped the grantee \"jum p start\" the approval process. 16 TABLE II. 2.

Recruiting patients f or the inte rvention and control groups was a challenge in eight of the nine projects that becam e operational. M any relied heavily o n administrative data. The grantees reporting the m ost success in this area sought to link their recruitm ent with individuals and organizations well respected by those they sought to recruit. Sharp HealthCare conducted focus groups and learned that physician support would be an important influence on patient participati on; accordingly, solicitation was done through the medical director of each site . LTCG used the C alPERS connectio n for recruiting but still faced challenges in this area. As one interviewee observed, grantees had to be serious about recru itment since on e could not assu me that patie nts would autom atically take advantage of new services. In som e cases in whic h recruitment was a cha lleng e, the g rantee ultim ately c ame close to its goals, so projec ts met their targets for participants in the random ized design. However, participa tion and attr ition was an issue f or some grantees, even when an adequate num ber recru , experienced a larg e drop in the number of individuals actually using thei r case m anagem ent services. And, both LTCG and Kaiser TriC entral found that som e services were not in de mand, particularly classes (LTCG) and benefits for hom e- and comm unity-based servi ces (Kaiser TriCentral). This outcom e was probably a function of a com bination of lack of knowledge of the available benefit or perceived need for those serv ices and case m anager and client efforts to \"hoard\" s ervices for later us e. In some cases, the absence of significant outco mes could reflect th e fact that th ose in the intervention group did not fully receive interventi on services or that thos e in the control group were already m aking extens ive use of services w ithout the intervention. 17 Randomi zation. In general, grantees considered the random ization requirem ent in developing their projects, and m ost said th at the process went sm oothly. In retrospect, som e sites (Pacificare/Secure Horizons) s aid they m ight h ave approached the pro cess differently. Provider reluctance to deny a potentially valuable servi ce to patients was a key challeng e for som e, especially if the design was deve loped closely with providers. Ka iser TriCentral, f or exam ple, responded to this challenge by offering contro l group m embers what was expected to be a minimal intervention consisting of brief case m anage ment by telephone, with inform ation and referra l. However, a diligent staff mem ber carrie d out the intervention with such dedication that staff feared it would be im possibl e to ascertain the effects of th e main intervention. The project was m odified to in clude a secon d round of interventio ns that add ed a sim ple m ailing o f inform ation as the least invasive intervention. Sharp HealthCare pr oject staff also had to include a form of intervention for the control group in th e random assignm ent design to get their buy-in. Data . Data challenges appear to ha ve been less formidable than is of ten the case. This is perhaps attributable to the fact that the use of a random ized de sign was m ade explicit up front, making it likely that grantees woul d review the ir data cap abilities in advance. Still, data were a challenge to som e grantees in ways that aff ected their operations. Kaiser TriCentral found it challenging to obtain data from community-based providers whos e system s were not set up to genera te rep orting or b illing f or individual serv ices, and this interf ered with Kaise r's ability to manage care or pay the provid ers. The Institute on Aging, which was part of a national evaluation, f ound it difficult to obtain the analysis of its project's perform ance from the national program office. PacifiC are/Secure Horizons so metimes struggled to get data from m edical groups and was also concerned about the consis tency of data across its sites. LTCG ha d difficulty obtaining outcom e data from health pl ans after the natu re of their rela tionship with CalPERS changed. Physician Support. Most of the grantees did not find it difficult to involve physicians in their projects; however, for those who did, the problem was substant ial. T he refusa l of physicians at the Sutter Medical Group to coop erate with the Institu te on Aging's project resulted in Sutter being dropped from the project. At JFCS, the refusal of Br own and Toland Medical Group to refer patients to the project after the m edical group experienced financial difficulties and was no longer capitated was a crucial reason for a pa rticipation shortfall. Ev en projects with good physician support (such as Sharp HealthCare) ha d to wor k hard to gain physician support by overcom ing the physicians' concerns about how car e managem ent would a ffect their authority for referra ls and their cos ts. Partnership with Community-Bas ed Providers. In general, grantees did not say that coordination with the comm unity-based organi zations was a problem\u2014despite the inherent challenges created by th e disp arate cultures and orien tations of thes e groups and the tensions that can arise from different perspectives. For exam ple, comm unity organizations som etimes view health plans as a source of re venue, and they m ay not understand why the plan will not pay them for i mportant services. The plan, in contrast, wonders why the agency fails to recognize the limits of the plan 's co ntrac ted b enefit pack age. Yet, wh ile p articipants comm ented on such differences, the organizations appear to have moved beyond them . From the perspective of one plan, the m ost concrete problem involved gett ing data from community-based organizations, which are typically not set up to communicate with large in surance companies. Kais er TriCentral had to work with community groups on this issu e; Kaiser also found th e process of developing contracts with num erous, sm all community organi zations cu mbersom e. While other grantees did 18 not specifically m ention problem s, they did cite an awareness of and attem pts to address the cultu ral d ifferences between community-based organizations and the plans and providers delivering m edical care. Staff/Par tner Stability . Turnover of staff was an issue in many of the projects. In very small organization s, turnover in even lower- level staff can disrupt day-to-day processes, and this type of turnover was noted by several grantees. Loss of key staff can je opardiz e the ability to build on accom plishm ents. For example, UCLA NPI had turnover in a key community liaison with the local Alzheim er's Association, added a new co-investigator m idway through the project, and experienced a change in the Kaiser lead in vestig ator when that person assum ed a different job in the organization. Even m ore fundam entally, a num ber of the sites experienced attrition in some of their participating provide rs. Sutter Health contribu ted little, for example, to the Institu te on Aging's project, and the UCLA GIM pilo t test went f orward with on ly two of its antic ipated three test s ites. W hile Sharp HealthCare m aintained its in terven tions, staf f say that \"lots of energy\" in communication and planning was need ed to work with PacifiCare, given the environm ental stresses of the period and thei r impact on that organization. The m ost dam aging loss to PEMC resulted from the instability of the Brown and Toland Medical Group, which was a key particip ant in tw o of the projects. Changing M+C Market. PEMC was conceiv ed at the heig ht of the m anaged care era, when Medicare managed care was grow ing rapidly. But its im plem entation spanned the period in which the m arket collaps ed. W hile California avo ided som e of the m assive withdrawals from the market experienced by other states , the shif t in C alifornia's environment had a critical influence on at leas t four the gran tees (Gold and Lake 2002) . PacifiCare, for example, found its ability to recruit participants comprom ised by decreases in its 2002 benefits package and the resulting inconsistency in benefits between Los Angeles and Orange counties, which had once shared the same benefit package. T he instability in th e M+ C market was also a fact or behind the Brown and Toland Me dical Group instability that led to JC FS's inability to recru it. However, it is noteworthy that the instability in the market at the tim e was not perceived by all grantees as having a large effect. The m arket had less of dest abilizing effect on grant ees with a m ore self- contain ed system (such as Kaiser TriCentral). Also, LTCG project staff felt \"fortunate\" in that they did not have to rely heavily on health m aintenance organizati ons and were thus af fected less by the turm oil in th e managed ca re market. Som e grantees (such as Sharp HealthCa re) we re ab le to com pensate for the loss of expected financ ial or adm inistrative support from managed care companies. Internal v ersus Enviro nmental Ch allenges. There is interest in understanding how muc h the ins tability in the M +C program lim ited the PEMC's success, as so me associated with the program over tim e perceive (Hum ensky and Gold 2003). This instability had an obvious effect on som e projects, particularly as manifested in the instability of the Brown and Toland Medical Group and pressures created for PacifiCare, a majo r managed care partner in several grants. The tight econom ic environm ent also probably exacerbat ed con cerns abou t the cos t-effectiven ess of the interventions and their busin ess rationale, although these concer ns were a factor from the start of the project. Yet, even while th e adverse n ature of the market stressed the organizations, m aking resources scarce and su ccess m ore difficult, it is not believ ed that the m arket environm ent was the p rimary inf luence on the difficulty gran tees had in a chieving positive ou tcomes. More 19 funda mental were the challenges faced in develo ping projects that could have a large im pact and be m ounted quickly. For m any grantees, im plementation was slowed by com plex, unexpected IRB requirem ents, and alm ost all faced challenges in recruitin g participan ts. Targeting beneficiaries and inte rvention design were issues th at several projects pondered with the benefit of hinds ight and in light of s ubgroup findings. Sharp HealthCare, for exam ple, said it would increase the eligibility cutoff for those without a specific diagnosis from age 80 to 85; include explicitly those w ith three o r more ins trumental activities of daily living and palliative needs; and incorporate a disease m anagem ent component into its intervention design. These chan ges would result in a more defined interv ention targ eted to a higher-risk group. Similar population targeting was suggested by LTCG on t he basis that its evaluation showed some evidence of success with de pressed patients. This finding led grantees to speculate that focusing on a less healthy population m ight in crease th e success of th e interven tion. Sim ilarly, more targe ted interventio ns were of interes t to Kaiser T riCen tral. For exa mple, som e participan ts in the project said that, in retr ospect, they m ight design their l ong-term care benefit to include fewer, m ore im portant servic es to reduce th e adm inistrative burden of negotiating provider contracts and to better m atch offering s to patient needs and priorities. All of these issues related to targeting be neficiaries and interventi on design suggest that the both the rapid m ovement to im plem entation w ithout extensive planni ng and testing and the overall challenges related to delivering better care to frail elders are fundam ental reasons why most grantees were not more succes sful. 4. What Did the Grants Accomplish , and Ho w Sustainable and Replicable Are interven tions saved money or improved patient outcom es (as discusse d in S ection C of this chapter). W ithout evidence of financial or other gains, m any grantees judged the costs of sustaining the interventions as being too high. Ne vertheless, the grants have gene rated som e useful tools, and most grantees believe th at they have benefited from participati ng in PEMC. (See Table II.3 for a summary of grantees' accom plishm ents and the likely sustainability of the grants.) Among the im plementation grantees, only one or ganization (Sharp Heal thCare) is planning to susta in the interv ention intact. O ne or m ore of the deliv ery sites ass ociated with the UCLA NPI interve ntion f or those with de mentia are stil cons idering whethe r to sus tain activ ities. I t seem s likely that Kaiser, a large and dom inant health care sy stem in Calif ornia tha t participa ted in two of the im plem entation gran ts, will us e the r esults of its participation to change som e aspects of education for and care d elivery to frai l elders generally and for those with dem entia\u2014 even if it d oes not su stain th e specific in terventions. There seem s to be m ore potential for sustainability from the related-ac tivities grants than from the im plem entation grants, although, in genera l, it is too ear ly to tell. The PEMC grants have generate d less-than-tangible bu t potentially long-la sting benefits for those organizations involved. In particular, m any of the grants allowed individu als associated with the gra nts to estab lish new rela tionship s (or build on existing ones) am ong health plans and medical, research, and comm unity-b ased organizations in Californi a. In addition, physicians and other providers who were exposed to or partic ipated in the interventions generally responded Services While the grantee say s that, in hindsight, it c ould have d efined case management better, st aff also say that the model u sed for the de monstrati on re mains a \"trademark pro gram\" that i s self sustaining. Ho wever, bec ause the interventi on was unabl e to be fully tested, the contributi ons of the proj ect were li mited. Kaiser TriCentr al Based o n the result s of th e evaluation, K aiser has deci ded not to proc eed with inten sive case manage ment, i ncluding benef its for ho me- and co mmunity-based servic es, be cause of the associate d cost and co mplexity. However, the progra m has shown po sitive effects for low- cost telephone care manage ment and has shifted care management staff away from geriatric c are manage ment to increase th e number of telep hone care managers. The organization ha s also increased its kn owledge of exi sting co mmunity-based providers and app ears to have integr ated the knowledg e from the evalu ation into its ongoing operation s. Institute on Aging As part of the national initiati ve, ne w instru ments exi st for assessing dementia and treat ment protocols hav e been devel oped to provide patient infor mation and fa mily caregiver support. The project continu es to have operational i mplications for Kaiser, which was the stronge st site. Kaise r is integratin g the care map and family question naire into their entire operation s to bett er care for dementia patie nts. Participati ng Alzh eimer' s Association grantees hav compone nts of the proj ect, incl uding referral for ms and educ ational approach es. Sharp Health Care Despit e the disappointing re sults, Sharp Healt hCare continu es to perceiv e their intervention to be valuable. In particular, it say s the Standardized Languag e for Case Management approac h, with intervention s for ten proble m areas, has all owed the organizati on to move forward with prog ram develop ment. The activity will be su staine d given the fa ct that it is in expen sive an d wel l structured. LTCG Results support the value of th e intervention i n increasi ng use of exercise e ven though no cost reduction w as achieved. Spo nsors perceiv e the proj ect as un sustainabl e because of high costs and a lack of return on invest ment. They believe that findings supp ort a more bare bones int erventi on in which indivi duals are c harged for exerci se. They also re cognize th at their intervention could provide a bett er return on invest ment if it w as target ed at l ess healthy populations, partic ularly those with depr ession. Pacificare/Sec ure Horizons The interventio n is not bein g sustaine d, as it d id not generate the anticipat ed saving s. How ever, PacifiCare i s continuing to u se the risk inde x it developed h ere to support i dentification of frail elders. UCLA NPI The analy sis of effects on re commended pro cesse s of care i s promising. St aff believe that the model is easily replicable; however, the evaluation of h ealth and h ealth care outco mes is still underway . An assessm ent of cost-effectivene ss would be a key factor in deter mining whether the intervention s will be sustain ed by grantee organization s. Project IMPACT Both pro mising result s and the develop ment of tools sugge st that a spects of this de monstrat ion will be su stain able. One of t he two partici pating California site s has expressed suppor t for sustaining the model, but, so far, its mental h ealth contractor has not adopte d it. The other site is also supportive but is ex amining the resource require ments for pay ing to su stain the model or expand it to oth er areas. Both sites indic ate tha t the approach should be ea sy to replicate in ot her setting s. UCLA GIM Diabete s guidelines for old er adults have been publi shed and have gaine d wide int erest and support a mong national advo cacy organizations and a ssociations. The newly developed tool kit should enhan ce the ability to use t he ap proach in a wide variety of health care delivery organization s. Because t he model is still bei ng pilot test ed, data on out comes do not y et exist. These data will be i mportant i n deter mining whether th e pilot test sites sustain the intervention and in generatin g interest in other locales. 21 positiv ely to them . Grantee organ izations say they have gained insight in to the proces s of developing care m anagem ent tools that m ay lead to improvem ents in care in their organization or elsewhere. Thus, while the outcomes of the in terventions did not pr ovide strong support for sustaining them , the implem entation experience m ay have increased both the interest in and capacity for developing f uture efforts to im prove care and outcom es for frail elders. The issue of replic ability is less a ques tion of whethe r and the e xtent to wh ich th e intervention s can be rep licated than it is a ques tion of whether it m akes se nse to do so. In fact, most grantees reported that they thought the in terventions could be re plicated outside their organizations and, indeed, quite broadly. Given the findings, however, wholesale adoption of the intervention s is un likely. Rather tha n an em phasis on m odels generated, PEMC's m ost im portant legacy m ay rest in the exa mples it provides for helping stakeholders both to understand the challenges involved in im proving care for frail elders and to shape a new ge neration of intervention s. C. DESIGN AND OUTCOMES FROM THE INDIVIDUAL GRANT EE E VAL UATIONS Final reports from the individual grantee eval uations are a vailab le for all bu t one of the operational projects, although there are som e gaps\u2014especially for th e project that was part of a broader national evaluation. These reports cove r all five of the general care m anage ment demonstrations and three of the four disease -specific dem onstra tions.17 This section reviews how the individual grantee evaluations were design ed and describes findings. Readers should note that these evaluations were conducted independent of the evaluation by MPR. The e valuators for each p roject were selected by the g rantee, and th e methods and types of analy ses varied acro ss the studies. In particular, pr ojects varied in term s of how comprehensively they addressed specific ou tcom e areas (such as nu mber of m easures, what types of data were collected, and whether pre- and post-intervention data were colle cted). M ost evaluations were able to addres s all of the outcom es that were originally targeted. Although som e projects experienced delays or difficultie s in im plem entation of tor staf each projec t indicated few m ethodological probl ems with data colle ction or analysis in im plementing the evaluation designs. Thus, the findings reported by the evaluations appear valid. Questions that rem ain include what explains the findings, whether the outcom es measured m ake sense, and what lessons exist for the future. These is sues are d iscussed in Se ction D following a descri ption of the evaluation results. Chapter III con tains a m ore extens ive di scussion of the value of including such rigorous evaluations as a core progra m strategy in grant making. 17 For one of the three avai lable disease-s pecific grant ee final reports (submitted by UCLA NPI), primary study outcomes (de mentia care pr ocesses ) and some seconda ry study outcomes (suc h as provider perceptions of care quality) were rep orted. Ot her second ary outcome data (for ex ample, patient health status or careg iver perceptions of quality) were n ot yet av ailab le at th e time o f repo rt pub licatio n. The evaluation for another of the four disease- specific pro jects (a related -activ ity g rant to UCLA GIM ) is on going, and a final rep ort has not been submitted; however, prel iminary basel ine resul ts and resu lts at a th ree-m onth follow-up for th e intervention group were provided. 22 1. Methods Used for Evaluating the I ntervention s Use of Random Assignment. All but one of the individual grantee evaluations used random assignm ent designs to evaluate the e ffects of th e interv entions on outcom es.18,19 While this f orm of evaluatio n was m andated by CHCF, each pr oject develo ped its own design and the outcom e measures th at were used varied.20 Final repo rts on the outcom es for each project were s ubmitted to the UCLA program office and to CHCF at the conclus ion of each gran t. Measures a nd Data Collection. The projects attem pted to measure a range of outcom es, using both survey and adm inistrative data. All of th e projects collected m easures of health s tatus and health c are utiliza tion.21 Other outcom es measured by selected projects includ ed health care costs, enrollee/caregiv er satisfact ion, enrollee behavior m odification (f or exam ple, exercise), health plan m ember retention, and use of home- or community-bas ed social services. In som e cases, outco me measures were calculated as th e difference in post-intervention (follow-up) outcom es between th e treatm ent and contro l groups. In other cases, outcom es were calculated as the difference in trends from baseline to fo llow-up between the treatm ent and control groups\u2014 often referre d to as \"d iffere nce-in-differences\" designs. The projects also collected a nd analyzed baseline data on socioeconom ic and dem ographic charac teristics of enro llees in the treatment and contro l grou ps. These d ata we re us ed prim arily to describe the study samples and to assess the success of the random ization. For all of the projects that used random ization, there were few statistically significant baseline differences, indicating th at random ization was su ccessful. Eight of the nine PEMC projec ts collected follow-up outcom e measures after an in tervention of at least 12 m onths.22 Data sou rces typically included an en rollee surv ey after the first yea r to 18 Randomization was at the patient level for si x of t he grantees (LTCG, Kaiser Tr iCen tral, Sh arp HealthCare, Pacificare/Sec ure Horizons , Project IMPACT, and UC LA GIM). Of the rem aining four grantees, t wo (UCLA NPI and JFCS) involved the randomization of physician practices, an d two (IOA a nd On Lok Senior Heal th Services) did not have randomized designs. 19 The o ne implementation pr oject that did not use a ra ndom assignment design was t he Northern California Chronic Care Network for Dementia project, led by IOA. This pro ject was no t designed to test th e effectiv eness of a specific in terven tion. Rath er, as part of a larg er national study of the Chronic Care Net work for Alzheimer's Disease, the e valuation for t his proj ect exa mined outcomes and im plementation experie nces ass ociated with the application of a set o f tools and procedures with in a ch ronic care m odel that tailored th e specific i nterventions to meet the nee ds of two of the three Ca lifornia sites that became operational. 20 Random ized assi gnment was chose n beca use it is the most po werful desi gn, allowing evaluators to attribute statistical ly si gnifican t outcome differen ces to the intervention itself and m inimizing c oncerns about potential sources of bias, such as self-s electi on and the influence of secular trends. 21 The Pacificare/Secure Hori zons program collected informatio n on one health-related ou tcome: mortalit y following the intervention. 22 The UCLA GIM in tervention was a pilot test th at lasted less th an 12 months with follow-u p data co llected at 3 and 6 m onths post intervention. P roject IMPAC T's intervention period lasted 12 months, but the project collected follow-up data for up to 24 months from the time the intervention was in itiated . Two proj ects ev aluated interventions for periods longer than 12 months (Kaiser TriCentral and UCLA NPI), each capturing data f or up to 18 months. 23 measure self-reported health status and use of services, as well as administrative data (including enrollm ent, claim s, or encounter data) to track u tilization and cost. Baseline m easures were also developed from both survey and ad ministrativ e data, and they were collected imm ediately prior to the intervention. Several p rojects also co llected add itional da ta on project implem entation experiences to provide a context for interpreting the outcom e results. JFCS interv iewed care managers about their experiences with the project and physicians to assess their sa tisfaction with th e intervention. The Kaiser TriCentral project interviewed treatm ent group enroll ees about the reasons they did not purchase coverage for hom e- and comm unity-based services . The project also involved a process analysis including site visits and chart review to unde rstand how the care m anage ment intervention was im plemented; d escriptive s tatistic s were also collected o n the use of community services by treatm ent group enrollees. Both the Pacificare/Secure Horizons and Sharp HealthCare projects collected des criptive stat istics on the use of c ommunity services by treatm ent group enrollees, but not for com parison groups. The IOA project surveyed, in three waves, all types of providers w ho rece ived ins truction and orientation to the in tervention m odel or who were involved with im plementing the case model. The survey focused on characteristics of providers and their perceptions of various as pects of the care m odel and its im pact on their ability to care for dem entia patients and fam ily caregivers. 2. Evaluation Findings\u2014Outcomes Synthesis Any assessm ent of the outcom es of PEMC would be incomplete withou t an analys is of the individu al grantee evalu ations th at were an inte gral part o f each project. MPR synthesized th e inform ation on outcom es reported in the final reports from the eight p rojects; th ese were written as part of each pro ject's evalu ation.23 Rather than provide indivi dual report c itations for the results given below, only the relevant projec t is ind icated. (See Ap pendix C for full report citations ; refer to pro ject repor ts and publications listed at th e end of each project summ ary.) General Care Management Pro ject Ou tcomes. As shown in Table II.4, the five general care m anagem ent projects did not show statistically sign ificant e ffects f or the vas t majority of outcom es that were m easured. For exam ple, all fi ve of the projects m easured effects on inpatient hospital and em ergency room (ER) use during th e first year of the in terventions and found no significant effects. Four of the fi ve projects also collected data on health status outcom es after the first year and found no significant effects as sociated with the interventions. Other outcom es reported less consistently across projects, but findings for these outcom es wer e also not statistically significan t, with a few exception s noted below. More detail on project-specific outcom e findings is included in th e project summ aries in Appendix C. 23 MPR did not con duct any primary data collection o r individual-level data anal ysis for t he outcomes synthesis beca use each project conducte d data collection and a nalysis; thus, a dditional efforts would ha ve bee n duplicativ e, and the Foun dation did not wish to fund it. At one point, the UCLA program office tried to do a meta- analysis by collecting pat ient level data on s pecific outcomes com mon to many sites. Ho weve r, they stopped when the com plexity of m erging such dive rse data becam e apparent, and indi vidual s ites resisted shari ng data because o f the burden of unanticipated requests, conce rns about patient privacy, and interests in publishing their own analyses. 24 TABLE II.4.

In particular, the Pacificare/Secure Horizons project found a sign ificant decrease in m ortality among intent to treat (ITT) group m embers. This project also found significant changes in different m easures of utilization, although the ov erall im pact on utiliz ation was unclear\u2014ITT group m embers had both a decrease in hospitalizations and an increase in physician care use. The Kaiser TriCentral project showed a significan t decline in average depression scores for one of the three treatment groups, while the control grou p showed no significant change; however, the authors of the final report concluded that these differences were not clinically m eaningful. The LTCG project showed significan t increas es in ae robic activity and stretching for the treatm ent group\u2014increases of 19 and 23 m inutes per week, re spectively\u2014com pared to declines in thes e activities for the control group. The JFCS project also showed a si gnificant increase in prim ary care physician visits and expenditures from base line to follow-up for the treatm ent group relative to the control group, an outcom e that runs counter to current interests in cost containm ent. Given the overall lack of significant findings (with the few exceptions noted above) attem pts were m ade to assess whether there were discernable patterns am ong the statis tically non- signif icant results that might indic ate an o verall effect no t captured b y any individual project. However, MPR was not able to id entify consistent or strongly apparent patte rns. For instanc e, three of the projects presented point estim ates indicating a decrease in hospital use for the treatm ent group relative to the control group, while estimates for two of the projects indicated increased hospital use. As noted above, all resu lts were not significant, and m ost estim ated differences were sm all in m agnitude. Several of the projects conducted s ensitivity an alyses or ad dition al analyses that looked beyond the m ain effects of the interventions m easured in the random assignm ent designs. The JFCS project conducted a follow- up retrospective anal ysis to com pare outcom es for a group of enrollees w ho receiv ed social serv ices to sev eral m atched com parison groups who did not receive these services. T he evalua tion for this project found that those w ho received the services were less likely to have prim ary car e visits and were m ore lik ely to have ER visits in the f ollow- up period; most other differences were not signif icant. However, the authors note that, becau se of substantia l differences in th e cha racteristics of the two retrospectivel y drawn sam ples (despite attem pts to m atch on age, sex, a nd self-reported functi oning), it was not possible to draw fir m conclusions from the analysis. Two projects assessed whether there were intervention effect s for specific subgroups. The project led by LTCG r eported that among participants with depression at baseline, treatm ent group m embers experienced a statisti cally significant decr ease in the level of depression, relative to the control group. The project le d by Sharp HealthCare reported that for those in the treatm ent group with three or m ore lim itations in instru mental activities of daily living, there was a significant reduction in the likeli hood of nursing hom e use for the treatm ent group relative to the control group. Given the large number of co mparisons that were made when looking at subgroups for these analyses, it is possible that some of the significant differences reported for these pro jects were the resu lt of statis tical chance alone.24 24 That is, with statistical testi ng perform ed at th e conventional p < 0.05 level, 5 pe rcent of the com parisons would show st atistical ly sig nifican t diffe rences base d on chance alone . 26 Disease-Specific Project Outco mes. Of the four disease-s pecific projects, one showed significan t effects from the care m anagem ent/pra ctice guideline interventions on key outcom es; results are lim ited or not available for the othe r three for the reasons noted below, though som e show prom ising effects on process and interm ediate m easures. Project IMP ACT, which tes ted the effects of a care m anagem ent intervention on elderly enrollees with depression in seven sites around the nation, found that 45 percent of enrollees in the treatm ent group had at leas t a 50 percen t reduction in depressive symp toms from baseline to 12-m onth follow-up, compared to 19 percent of enrollees in the contro l group. Some 25 percent of the treatm ent group was free of depression at follow-up, com pared to 8 percent of the control group. The treatm ent group also experienced higher rates of satisfaction with care, lower rates of functional impairm ent, and increased quality of life com pared to the control group. Among a subgroup of enrollees with arthritis in the Project IMPACT study, the treatm ent subgroup reported lower pain intensity, fewer lim itations on activities of da ily living, and greater overall health and quality of life relative to th e control subgroup after 12 months of intervention. As noted earlier, the project led by IOA did not directly test the effects of a specific intervention using a comparis on group or a random assignm ent design. Instead, it exam ined baseline and follow-up differences in outcom es for older patients with Alzheim er's disease who were enrolled in care m anagem ent program s implem ented in two different m anaged care settings (Kaiser Perm anente San Francisco and Brown and Toland Medical Group). The project found that the two sites we re signif icantly different in term s of baseline and follow-up m easures of health care utilization, likely due to differences in the severity of illn ess of the two enrolled populations. At the sam e time, there were seve ral significant reductions in utilization from baseline to follow-up within organizations, o ccurring prim arily at Kaiser Perm anente and particularly am ong patients who were not placed in a long-term care faci lity during the follow-up period.25 The two sites also did not show significan t differences in use of services from Alzheim er's Association chapters, in dicating that chapter services were offered equally in both settings, an d that the level of intere st by f amilies of enrollees was s imilar. The us e of chapte r services was high (70 to 79 per cent of enrollees had some chap ter service us e) com pared to evidence fro m previous research. The UCLA NPI evaluation invo lved analysis of both prim ary and s econdary outcom es. Prim ary outcom es measure the de gree of adherence to the dem entia care guidelines. Secondary outcom es indicate caregiver satisf action, caregive r strain, patient health outcom es, provider knowledge and perceptions of car e quality, extent of im plem entation of the in tervention, and cost-effectiveness. Prelim inary analyses conduct ed found that interventi on group caregivers were more likely to have adhered to 21 of the 29 dementia care processe s, suggesting that the intervention had beneficial im pacts on de mentia care quality. In ad dition, the intervention appeared to have had little im pact on provider kn owledge or attitudes favo rable to dem entia care; however, th e evaluation stated that \"intervention clinic providers perceived t hat there was bett er 25 Kaiser Perm anente Sa n Fra ncisco e nrollees expe rienced a significant decrease i n ER, prim ary ca re, and speci alty phy sician vi sits, and B rown an d Toland M edical Gro up reported a si gnificant redu ction in specialty physician visits. 27 availability of resources and car e coordination for dem entia patients compared to perceptions of usual care clinic providers (p < 0.01).\" Early results from the UCLA GIM e valuation we re prim arily from a patient survey, which collected data on the 106 participants in th e baseline sa mple (52 control group and 54 intervention group) and on the fi rst 62 of 82 participants (30 c ontrol group and 32 intervention group) at three m onths. The inte rvention and control groups were similar at baseline. Based on these three-month follow-up results , most participants responded favorably to the intervention and reported improve ments, such as better confid ence in their understand ing and skills related to diabetes (93 percent), aging (70 percent), and m edication m anagem ent (74 percent). 3. Process Analysis and Explanation for Results Explanations for In tervention Outcomes. There were three pos sible flaws that would explain why the interv entions were n ot more effective. In terventions were flawed in (1) concept; (2) design and m easurem ent; or (3) execution. In the f irst case, the theo ry behind th e inte rventio n was f lawed. That is, th e inte rventio n was not the appropriate \"lever\" for generating the outcom e of interest, even under the best of circum stances. Interven tions that were concep tually f lawed m ay be inef fectiv e in and o f them selves, or they were effec tive in som e ways but not in in troducing change in the outcom e(s) of interest. In the second case, the theory behind the intervention may have been sound, but the experim ent was not designed well enough to test the theory. For exa mple, an intervention would be flawed in its de sign if it was no t appropria tely targeted to those m ost likely to ben efit, or the intervention and control groups m ay have been selected or structured in ways such that there was little practical difference in the treatm ent receiv ed by each. Flaws in m easurem ent include, for exam ple, a sam ple that was too sm all, in whic h case the design would not have enough power to identify outcom es. Another m easurem ent flaw is an inappropriately sh ort observation period. In the third case, both the theory behind and intervention and its design were sound, but the implem entation was f lawed. That is , the in tervention m ay have been in completely implem ented or im plem ented in a way tha t was n ot \"faithful\" to the design. This could occur, for exam ple, if certain pa rts of the inter vention wer e not im plem ented at all or if patien t recruitment targ ets wer e not m et or protocols were not follow ed. Determ ining which type of flaw, or flaws, le d to outcom es different than those hoped for typically involves working back wards to see h ow com pletely and accurately the design was implem ented, the exten t to which the design itself was well s uited to tes t the theory, and whether the design was appropriately im plemented. To the ex tent that there we re weaknesses in design or execution, the theory behind an intervention cannot be said to have been tested fairly. Evidence from Independent Grantee Evaluations. In grantee evaluations, res earchers give som e attention to outcom es issues (flaws in concept, design/m easurem ent, or execution), 28 though not necessarily in a system atic or uniform fashion.26 The focus of grantee ev aluations, as well as the MPR evaluation, was on im plementation grants (not related-ac tivity grants) and on general care m anage ment interventions, as th ese were the m ain thrust of th e program . Unfortunately, lack of clear specification of the nature and intens ity lev el of the intervention s (such as through guidelines or other detailed prot ocols) m ade it difficult to distinguish between execution and design. The evidence suggests that weaknesses in both m ay have contributed at least in pa rt to the abse nce of more def initive outcom es and that the a bsence of more f ormal protocols to support the intervention itse lf could reflect a weakness in design. Of the f ive im plem entation gran ts that invo lved general case m anage ment m odels, there i s some evidence that weaknesses in execution could have contributed to th e null findings in at least three o f the five cases. Referral rates were very low in JFCS, in which only six individuals were referred from Brown and Tol and Medi cal Group and for which physician support was lacking. In both the Kaiser TriC entral and Pacificare/Secure Hori zons projects, service use was relatively low in the intervention group. In Kaiser Tr iCentral, less than half of eligible enrollees (54 of 124) used the $2,000 purchase of community services benefit. Although enrollees who responded to the survey often said they did not need the benefit, they were not always clear on the purpose of the benefit or on whether they were eligib le for it. Othe rs wanted to wait \"until a rainy day.\" In Pacificare/Secure Horizons, the rate of service use varied from 21 pe rcent for in- home care and psychosocial support services to 30 percent for hom e safety services, 36 percent for transportation services, and 38 percent for nutr ition counseling. The Kaiser TriCentral focus groups suggest that a high proportion of time was spent on assessing, as opposed to implementing, a care plan. At JFCS, the lack of custom ized care m anagem ent training was cited as a weakness. As noted, it is not clear whether these weakn esses reflect failures in e xecution or design. However, the results clearly indicate that the intensity of the intervention was relativel y limited in som e experi ments, so the abse nce of strong outcom es is not surprising. It is a lso possible that failures in design and m easure ment m ay have contributed to the absence of positiv e outcom es. For most interv entions, thos e in the con trol group could receive some or all of the services rece ived by those in the intervention group, but they had to seek them out. In the Kaiser TriCentral project, not on ly was service use lo w am ong those in the experim ental group, but also th ere was evidence that, in the first round of random ization, the control group was getting a m uch more robus t intervention than in tended because of the conscientiousness of the telephone case m anager. Both LTCG and Sharp HealthCare perceived, in retrospect, that they might have defined their target populat ion m ore precisely, and Kaiser TriCentral would have thought about m ore tightly targeting those eligible for the intervention. Perspectives of Program Office and Founda tion Staff. Program office and foundation staff reporte d a var iety o f factors to e xplain the la ck of positiv e outcom es from the interventions . In term s of concept, it m ay have been unrealistic to expect change in the kinds of funda mental indicators exam ined. Pr ogram office staff noted that there was a lot of \"noise\" in the system . 26 Two main kinds of an alysis are in cluded: (1) process m easures of recru itmen t, particip ation, utilizatio n, and referrals under the intervention that shed light on the \"treatm ent\" an d, by inferen ce, th e ex tent to wh ich th e interventions actu ally o ccurred; and (2) surv eys or fo cus groups with phy sicians, care managers , caregi vers, or enrollees to prov ide a qu alitativ e assessmen t of the eff ectiv eness of the intervention and to identify facto rs contributing to or detracting from effectiv eness. 29 Because fra ilty has m any dim ensions, it m ay have be en unrea listic to expect that cas e manage ment and comm unity-based services alon e would be strong enough to \"m ove\" indictors in a way that would demonstra te to p urchase rs an d plans that there cou ld be a positiv e return on investm ent. In term s of design, staff said that one issu e may have com e from the fact that the intervention s did not incorpora te elem ents that motivate f rail patients to want to take advantage of services. In other words, it was p resum ptuous to believe th at patien ts will au tomatically take advantage o f new servic es. On the c ontrary, an interven tion will a ttract the targ et po pulation only if it is c reated to respon d to th eir concerns a nd needs. For instance, focusing on those in crisis may target r esources to those m ost likely to take advantage of the servic es. Furthermore, doing so through an intervention that draws in m edical staff and takes advant age of the trust they develop with their patients over time m ay make thos e in crisis m ore willing to a ccept he lp once they realize they need it. In evaluating execution, program office staff point ed out tha t there were m ajor challe nges in simultaneously satisfying the research need for a clear design and the practical needs of organization s deliv ering health care. For instan ce, clinicians and case m anagers trained to view each patien t as un ique m ay have trouble accepting a stand ard treatm ent pr otoco l, especially for patien ts with com plex needs. Therefore, deve loping support for an intervention m ay require methodological com promises that detract from its potential effectiven ess. Those approving grants, like the PEMC grants, typically have only a lim ited pool of applicants from which to choose. Moreover, there m ay be strong incentives in the applicant select ion process to take advantage of sponsor interest and resources in ways that build upon applicant interest and provide awards to proposals with shortcom ings, assum ing problem s can be dealt with later. The fact that PE MC focuses on frail elders, a group that m any regard as being insufficiently served by the existing system , raises the le vel of interest in an interventi on that would bene fit this group, even if the evidence base for how to intervene effectively is lacking, as it was in a num ber of ways when PEMC was launched and as it rem ains today. In Chapter III, the random ized design, which wa s an essential part of PEMC, and the lessons for future foundation programm ing a re discussed in m ore detail. 4. Program Office Analysis of Factors Important to Success In response to early feedback from grantee monitoring indicating th e grantee evaluations were likely to show only lim ited change in m easured outcom es, the program office (with support from CHCF) initiated qualitativ e research in order to bett er understand the im plem entation process and the lessons that could be deri ved from it (Jones, Reuben, and Frank 2004). The analysis was based on sem istructured, in-dep th in terviews with m ore than 60 individu als involved in different ways with each gran tee. These in terviews were reco rded, transcribed, and im ported into an ethnographi c com puter program for coding. Using codes applied by a nalysts to key statem ents in the interviews, the program facili tated analysts' ability to draw out the dom inant them es emerging from the interview s, accord ing to the repor t's autho rs. The findings suggest th at interviewees believe there were p otential gain s to each p arty from participa ting in th e interventions, but there wer e also m any challeng es th at need to be addre ssed. 30 The analys is conclud ed that recruitm ent is a k ey challenge, given both the reluctance of some patients\u2014or som e physicians\u2014to \"buy in\" to the project goals and the constraints im posed by institutional instability and ad ministrative procedures (such as access to data for patient identification). Another challe nge identified is the esta blishm ent of good communication\u2014 among the organization s involved in each of the gr ants and within ind ividual o rganization s\u2014that addresses organizational, adm inistrative, pers onnel, and cultural barriers. Good communication between the physicians and patients is also essential. Interv iewees suggested that captu ring the atten tion and interest of physicians affiliated with the project and involving them in recruiting and in tervening can help to bu ild patient trust. But there are barriers to this effort as well, incl uding physician tim e and sc heduling constraints, an organizational culture that m ay not support change , physician attitudes towa rd chronic illness, clinicians' professional views of their roles, co mmunicatio n barriers created by d ementia and other illn esses, and a lac k of incentiv es tha t enco urage invo lvement. Overall, m elding the dive rse interests of patients, case m anagers, physicians , and researchers (especi ally evaluators) was undoubtedly a challenge. The changing landscape in which health care was delivered over the study period was also a challenge. The analysis highligh ts factors that are im portant to consid er in judgin g PEMC's s uccess, though it cannot com pletely expl ain why PEMC did not yield th e positive outcom es anticipated. On the other hand, the findings do not shed light on how these factors played out under PEMC because th e experien ces of individual gran tees were not traced. For ex ample, the num ber and type of grantees that experienced particular ch allenges is not known. Als o unclear is how each of the partners handled chal lenges and what the outcom es of their efforts were. As a result, it is no t clear how important these factors were in contributing to su ccess o r failure. Despite these gaps , however, the analysis points to im portant issues to consider when im plem enting interven tions like thos e in PEMC. It also reveals s ome areas th at could be pursued in future research on this topic. D. HOW PEMC FINDI NGS COMPARE TO OTHERS The lack outcom es is not surprising. For the m ost part, the im plem entation gran ts facilitated the testi ng of a diverse set of general, but lim ited, case m anage ment mode ls overlaid on m edical care system s whose participants were not asked to change very m uch about the way they practiced. As noted, at the time PEMC was developed, positive outcom es from interventions ta rgetin g frail elde rs tended to be lim ited (Boult, et al. 1999, 2000). Reductions in health care use or costs through unstructured case m anagem ent did not typically occur though these program s. (See Appendix E for annotated bibliography of related research on case m anagem ent\u2014or care m anagem ent\u2014and disease manage ment.) After an evaluation showing basically null results fro m a predecessor of the JCFS demonstration, Boult (2000) conc luded that studies should cap ture more outcom es and test alternative types of case m anagem ent. In part icular, he encouraged the developm ent of intervention s tha t include spec ific proto cols to identif y individuals appropriate for case manage ment, evidence-based algorithm s, tim e-limited care for defined conditions, close communication, and more effective collaborat ion between case m anagers and prim ary care 31 physicians. Unfortunately, however, these conclusi ons were drawn after PEMC was for med, or at least do not appear to have been av ailable to staff developing the program . Evidence- and algorithm -based interventions we re not very well developed in the five generalized PEMC case manage ment interventions. However, they ten ded to be present in th e condition-specific im plem entation grants and also (t o an extent) in two of the five general care manage ment grants that seem ed to fare better in generating som e kind of sustainable outcom e. The two general care m anagem ent grants\u2014Kaise r TriCentral and Sharp HealthCare\u2014both used well-defined screening tools and algorithm s to identif y those eligib le for the interven tion. Although neither focused on specific conditio ns, Sharp HealthCare did aim to track a set of clinical da ta to m onitor enrollee nee ds. (W hile matically tes ted alterna tive interventions, it was th e form of t he intervention, rather th an patient need, that defined the strategy). B oth grantees designed their program s to provide regul ar feedback betw een the car e managers and the primary care physician. Kaiser TriCentr al, in pa rticular, focused on creating prim ary care team s that could take advantag e of regularly scheduled appointm ents. In contras t, these elem ents we re less pres ent in the o ther three general care m anagem ent demonstrations. PacifiCare/Secure Horizons also used an algorithm , but it appears to have been more lim ited, as was the f ormality of the comm unication between the case m anager and physician. The LTCG project was basically set up to focus on nonm edical behavior and essentially bypassed th e health sys tem. And JFCS was ultim ately sep arate from its asso ciate medical practices. The interventions tested by all five of these grantees were m uch less defined than those focused on Alzheim er's, diabetes, or depression. Frail elders reflect a divers e population with multiple n eeds that are influenced both by chronic disease and by various phy sical, cognitive, and m ental impairm ents. The best-known model of how to in tervene in treatin g chron ic illness was original ly developed by Ed Wagner and his colleagues (W agner, et al. 1996). The cu rrent version of the model is based on the assum ption that ch ronic care need s will not be m et unless the health ca re system changes f rom responding to acute and urgent needs to respondi ng to needs associated with care for chronic conditions (Bodenheim er, et al. 2002). The follo wing six characteristics of such reform ed delivery system s are part of his m odel: 1. Community Resources and Policies . To improve chronic care, provider organizations need linkages with commun ity-based resources (su ch as exercise program s, senior centers, and self-help groups). 2. Health Care Organization. If an organization's goals and leaders do not view chronic care as a prio rity, innov ation will n ot take place. If purchasers and insure rs fail to reward high-qua lity chronic ca re, improvem ents are dif ficult to sustain. 3. Self-Management Support. Support involves helping pa tients and their fa milies acquire th e skills and confidence to manage their ch ronic illne ss, providing self- manage ment tools (such as diets and re ferra ls to community re sources), and ely as sessing prob lems and accom plishm ents. 32 4. Deliver y Sys tem Des ign. The structu re of m edical prac tice m ust be altered so that practice team s with a clea r division of labor are cr eated and acute care is separated from the planned m anagement of chronic conditions. 5. Decision Support. Evide nce-bas ed clinica l prac tice guidelines provide standards for optim al chronic care and should be in tegrated into daily physician practice through rem inders on needed care or follow-up. 6. Clinical Inf ormation S ystems. Computerized inform ation has three important roles. It serv es as: (1) re minder syste ms that help prim ary car e team s comply with practice gu idelines; (2) feedback to phys icians, showing how each is perform ing on chronic illness m easures; and (3) regist ries for planning individual patient care and conducting population-based care. Because ch ronic diseas e and frailty are often a ssociated, it is reason able to ask whether interventions focused specifically on frailty shoul d include the features that are thought to be important to success in chronic care m anage ment\u2014and, if so, how the PEMC projects \"stack up\" against these criteria. The answer is not cl ear. There is no doubt that PEMC's em phasis on community resources is very consistent with the chronic care m odel, and that PEMC's effort to prioritize relationships between medical providers and community-b ased servic es in the program deserves recognition. PEMC also sought to engage the leaders of delivery system s, and som e of the interventions included innova tive features, such as team s (Kaiser TriCentr al), health prom otion and self-m anagem ent (LTCG and seve ral other projects), and autom ated decision support (Sharp HealthCare). Fo r the m ost part, however, PEMC projects focused less on particula r chronic cond itions and more on f railty in gen eral, f or which guide lines are more difficult to estab lish. T o com plicate m atters f urther, not all agree th at guid elines are even valuable or feasible. Furtherm ore, PEMC did not, for the m ost part, seek to reorgan ize the entire delive ry sys tem. Rather, the goa l was to be tter link these m edical systems to comm unity-b ased social service providers and to introduce m ore lim ited, but afford able, change. The idea behind this appro ach was to take advan tage of the incentives o f capitation to introdu ce m arginal improve ments (for exam ple, the team s used by Kais er TriCentral or the autom ated tools used by Sharp HealthCare). Overall, the Program for Elders in Managed Care and th e litera ture shed ligh t on three possible strategies that may better address the needs of frail elders. The first strategy is to continue to support m ore generalized interventions focused on frail elders but to modify the criter ia or o utcom e measures by which success is judged. Fo r instance, it could be that im proving health outcom es in the tr aditional ways are inappropriate, at least for some frail elders who are on an irreversib le downward tra jectory. In this case, it m ay be that providing com fort in the way of caregiver and fa mily support is the best one can achieve. Or, when so m uch is lacking in te rms of system s integration, mere ly supporting efforts that im prove communication between m edical providers and community-based service providers m ay be valuable in itse lf, partic ularly if it provides th e assurance th at effectiv e interventions were not overlooked just becau se the need was not identifie d. The fa ct that th ese kinds of outcom es are not likely to provide an imm ediately m easurable return on investm ent does not m ean that they are not valuable in other m eaningful ways. 33 The second possible strategy is to try to app ly som e of the lessons of disease-f ocused intervention s to constr uct inte rventions f or frail elde rs tha t work better. For ins tance, intervention s could be d irected to f rail elde rs at particular points of vulnerability (such as when they are in trans ition f rom one setting of care to another or during hospitalization) or for particular events or conditions (such as falls, dementia, or depression). This approach m ay be focused enough so that resources can be directed to the patients m ost ready to accept help and to the situation s for which inte rvention s could be mo st cost-effective. W hat appear to be prom ising results from Project IMPACT and the UCLA NPI interventions sugg est that th is strategy may have som e potential. The third strategy is to reorgan ize care sys tems accord ing to the v ision of Ed W agner an d others so th at they a re more respon sive to th e needs of the chronica lly ill pa tients, particula rly those with multiple conditions and who are frail as well. This app roach is ba sed on the conclusion that lim ited interventions yield lim ited results and that th e emphasis, the refore, ne eds to be on more m assive change. Unfortunately , while such m ajor system redesign m ay be valuable, the environm ent is su ch that m assive change in fi nancial incentives and in how institutions relate to one anot her are not likely to be forthcom ing in the imm ediate f uture. The more practical approach for t hose who want to pursue this st rategy m ay be to support m ore targeted reorganization efforts. The author ity for specialized Medicare+Choice plans m ay provide the opportunity to further test and develop these types of models. Sim ilarly, the interest in encouraging use of electronic health records should be m aximized in order to enhance support for interventions that improve communications across providers\u2014creating, in effect, \"virtual system s.\" In sum , the PEMC experien ce highlights the v alue of developing interventions that have explicit goals. It also points to the need to think critically about these goals and to develop interventions that are designed sp ecifically to achieve th em. 34 III. FINDINGS ON OTHER PROGRAM COMPONENTS In addition to the core im plementation gr ant activities, PEMC involved various other program components. This chapte r exam ines these other aspects of the program with a view toward dete rmining their contr ibutio n to the suc cess of PEMC and the im plication s for future program design. Five particular com ponents of the program were exam ined. The first was the use of planning grants. Thes e gran ts were an im portant featu re of the program, and MP R reviewed the outcom es of these grants and evaluated their contribu tion to PEMC. A second program feature was the provision of a lim ited amount of flexible funding, first to support related activities and later t o augm ent implem entatio n grantees ' analys is in ta rgeted ways. Included are a description of ho w funds were used and an assessm ent of their contribution to program goals. A third program feature was the inco rporation of a relatively rigorous independent evalu ation as an integral part of each of the im plem entation gran ts. The infrastructure established for this purp ose and the results from the evaluations, already described in Chapter II, are considered to draw conclusions about the value of this com ponent . The fourth program com ponent exam ined is the overall administration of the program itself. And the fifth is the program 's success in dissem inating project findings. A. WHAT DI D PEMC B UY WITH THE PLANNING GRANTS? The planning grants are briefly described here, including what they accom plished, and conclusions are drawn about the va lue of this type of com ponent in the design of a program like PEMC. (See Appendix G for m ore inform ation and additional detail on planning grants. This appendix includes inform ation on planning grant activities, their consistency with proposed PEMC efforts, and accom plishm ents. Also incl uded is the im petus for sponsors to develop planning grants and reasons for pr oceeding with a planning grant rather than an im plem entation grant. The appendix als o presents s ome exam ples of the types of challenges grantees faced in moving forward under the grants.) 1. Description of Grantees and Outcomes PEMC funded a total of 13 plann ing grants of up to $75,00 0 each for a total expen diture of about $1 million (see Table III.1 ).27,28 Planning grants were awarde d to support the developm ent of care system s (including partnerships am ong key organizations) and needs assessm ent and 27 Howe ver, San Die go State Unive rsity recei ved a second planning grant for $100,000 i n the second fundi ng cycle. Th e purpo se of the seco nd grant was to conduct a small pilot program to test the in tervention created in the initial g rant. 28 The types of gra ntees we re relatively disparate a nd included heal th plans, care delivery organizations, community-based ser vice o rganizations, a nd o wned and government-owned entities; p rofit statu s also varied and included both nonprofit and for-profit organizations. 37 TABLE III.1.

A key feature of this grant involved devel oping a dual-eligibles database to support planning.

T he Cycle 1 gra nt was a planning grant and the Cycle 2 grant was a pilot, not a full-scale implem entation grant. feasibility studies. (See Appendix A for m ore background infor mation on planning grants.) Ten grants were awarded in Cycle 1 of PEMC, with the expec tation th at they would be elig ible to compete for implem entation gr ants in Cycle 2. An addition al three gr ants (one f or a pilo t to a grantee in C ycle 1 ) were m ade in Cycle 2, wi th the recognition that ad dition al implem entation funding would not be forthcom ing; the gran ts needed to provi de an outcom e of intrinsic value to the organization. Of the ten Cycle 1 gr antees award ed plann ing grants, eig ht subm ns for a Cycle (see Tab le III.1 ceived such a grant (LTCG, ecure Horizons, and On Lok Senior H ealth Services); a fourth grantee w as provided an addition al plann ing grant in C ycle 2 to carry out a more lim ited pilot of their proposed intervention (San Diego State Un iversity Center on Aging).29 In general, those turned down for funding were viewed as not ready\u2014m eaning that their organizational infrastructures and specific projec t plans were not sufficiently developed. Two of the four that were denied im plementation gr ant funding (LA Care and Contra Costa County Office on Aging) involved interventions for dua l eligibles by Medi-Cal plans knowledgeable 29 One of t he three, On L ok Senior Healt h Services, ha d its gran t term inated before it was operation al. Th e reason for te rmination was a delay in receivi ng HCFA's a pproval for a necessary waiver. 40 about Medicaid requirem ents but unable to develop the Medicare component. A third attributed failure to its initial selec tion of its comm unity partner and the ensuing difficulty in m oving to firm implem entation plans (Kaiser Perm anente Aging Network); a f ourth was a community initiative in a single county where comm unication seemed to have been strong, but for mal programm ing for im plementation was m ore limited (Redwood Health S ervices). In the case of Contra Costa County Office on Aging, additiona l planning has m oved forward with state support. Organizational instability and other factor s led to the other three efforts dissipating after additional support was not forthcom ing. The two Cycle 1 planning grantees that did not subm it applic ation s for implem entation grants in C ycle 2 generally did not perceive they were ready. In one case (CalO PTIMA), the planning g rant invo f or a dual- eligibles pro ject delayed by problem s in receiv ing access to Medi care data that was ne cessary to support an important part of the work. The other (South Ca lifornia Healthcare System s) was delayed in planning by the lim ited availabil ity of a key leader, the absen ce of a strong physician link, and difficulty in arranging the comm unity com ponent. In the case of CalOPTIMA, t he data are reported to still be in u se; in the case of Southern California Hea lthcare System s, the project is viewed as enriching the knowledge of its associated partners and staff, t hough no specific chang e has been m ade. Cycle 2 planning grants were not expected to compete fo r implem entation funding. The two new grantees both focused on dual eligibles; the third wa s a Cy cle 1 grantee th at received funding for a pilot). One (Community Health Group) used the planni ng grant to develop screening tools and protoc ols for care m anage ment that rem ain in lim ited use today. The second (Lifelong Medical Care) used the grant to develop a feasibility analysis for a dual-eligibles project that could sidestep the federal waiver process and could also build on som e related work funded by another foundation. In both cases, grantees view ed the work as us eful in th e long run in positioning them to consid er these kinds of projects. Beyond the tangible accom plishments, virtually all the grantees perceived that their involvem ent in the p lanning grants had enh anced their in sights and s kills relevant to issues important to frail elders and those who care for them . Relations hip building was a n importan t outcom e that was som etimes sustain ed for the re levant organizations and other tim es was not because of staff turnover and org anizational ch ange. Those leaving prog rams som etimes said th at the relationships went with them , especially if they stayed in the sam e geographical area. 2. Evaluation of the Plan ning Grant Component Feedback from those that im plem ented project s (see Chapter II), as well as tho se that did not, supports the value of planning grants in building ef fective operational projects. Those applying for planning grants generally were attr acted by the concept of wh at a larger operation al project would accom plish, but they also perceive d that their organ ization was not yet well- enough positioned to undertake such a project. Ke y gaps included: (1) the need to identify required partners and form ation of necessary relationships f or partnering; (2) gaps in knowledge (for exam ple, organizations prim arily fa miliar w ith Med icaid needed to learn about Medicare or those in acute care needed to le arn more about community services ); and (3) the need to better define and explore the feasibility of their conc epts (for ex ample, defi ning benefit structures, assessing financial feas ibility, and de termining m arket inte rest). 41 While m ost grantees were aware that they co uld have proceeded direct ly to im plem entation, most said they just weren't ready. Planning gran ts provided useful tim e and support to carry out this work and leveraged what m any saw as \"the prestige of the Foundation\" toward their efforts. Even those that proceed ed directly to im plementation later perceived that more support for initial planning could have been valuable , particula rly if the inter vention had been rela tively untes ted and new. In general, the success of pl anning grants in allowing grantees to m ove forward to full implementation appeared in the bounds of what m ight be expected, particularly given the tim ing of awards. Those receiving pl anning gran ts that soug ht to compete effectively for an implementation grant had to m ove very rapidly. Though grantees were orig inally scheduled to have a full twelve m onths to plan, the request for proposals for Cycle 1 grants was issued less than six m onths after P EMC was a uthorized (Nove mber 1997), although awards were not m ade until a y ear later (Octob er 1998).30 The call for the second cycle of grants was announced very soon afterwards (January 1999), with awards made a year later (January 2000). CHCF acknowledged in interviews that this am ount of tim e probably wa s not ideal, neither in giving those with planning g rants in Cycle 1 the opportu nity to benefit from planning before subm itting an im plementation grant proposal, or in giving CH CF ti me to learn from the first grant cycle. (See Appendix A for more inform ation.) Howeve r, the tim ing was determ ined in response to grantee concerns to ensu re that there was no gap in funding for planning grantees that receive d implem entation grants in Cycle 2; grantees als o needed to keep staff they had hired during the planning grant. That only three of the ten Cycle 1 planning grants were approved for implementation, and a fourth led to a more lim ited pilot, is arguably an excellent outcom e for the planning g rants, given th e pace of co mpetitiv e cycles. In addition, PEMC's planning gran ts appear to have provided a way for CHCF to test riskier or m ore cutting-edge projects whose feasibility was uncertain, particularly projects for dual eligibles and multicultu ral inte rventions tha t departed f rom the m odel of \"mainstrea m Medicare managed care.\" Such interventions are im portant, but they are very challenging, as they require coordination between two m ajor financing progra ms (Medicare and Medicaid), and am ong a host of diverse provider types and the complex m ulticultural environm ent in which prog rams operate in California. Typically, these projects were ba sed in Medicaid m anaged care p lans in which knowledge of Medicare was lim ited and whose organizations had fe wer resources to invest in such interventions than m ajor m anaged care firm s and provider system s. One lesson from this evaluation m ay be that the re is a need f or increa sed e ffort to m atch the extent of planning support to the level of challeng e of the intervention and to grantees' available resources for support planning. In particular, projects that address the needs of frail elders jointly eligible for Medicare and Medi caid need a m uch longer planning horizon and m ore technical assis tance. Apparently, so do community-based efforts involving m ultiple organ ization s with limited preexisting history. As one grantee obser ved when asked what they would have done differently (if anything): 30 From 117 l etters of intent for either planning or implementation grants in Cycle 1, only 21 were invited to submit full prop osals, lead ing to the ultimate selectio n of 10 planning and 3 implementation gran ts. 42 \"Maybe [I would] have looked at a two-year planning grant. It was such a new conc ept. Maybe [it would have b een better to] break down im plem entation in to pieces. It was a huge undertaking in this community to attem pt this. It was bold and exciting to attempt this, and th ere was a sense in the community that we can really serv e senio rs better. Trying to cram the planning grant into one year was rushed . It takes time to create and manage such a huge change. I would have liked more tim e.\" On the other hand, intensive planning efforts require m ore foundation commit ment with perhaps less po tentia l for succ ess. Resulting projec ts may also be fairly unique and less read ily rep licable for larger p opulations. This m eans that there are tradeoffs between reaching m ore people b y going after large m ainstream applications and ad dressing perhaps the hardest challen ges, which are im portant but m ore likely to require additional tim e and resources to surm ount. In general, the experience of PEM C suggests th at planning grants are most likely to m ove forward when key organizations and their partners are stable and have previous experience working together. Strong leadership, without tu rnover, is important. E nvironm ental challenges, even unan ticipated ( like the meltdown of the Medicare m anaged care program nationwide and the shifting interests of California's Medi-Cal program ), make succes s more difficult. Finan cial stress, distracting priorities, and situations le ading organizations to focus on survival m ake successful planning substantially more difficult, if not i mpossible. In addition, the m ovement from planning to im plem entation seem s more likel y when initial conc epts and partnerships are sound, and when the change called for is not exceptio nally challenging. All this suggests that the kind of careful scrutiny given to th e initia l selection of grantees and concepts is ver y important for programs like PEMC . B. DID P EMC'S FLEXIBLE F UNDING FO R RELATED ACTIVITI ES AND PROJECT AUGMENTATION P AY OFF? Both by design and by chance, PEMC had availabl e a lim ited am ount of funds that could be allocated for purposes related to the goals of PEMC. Originally, a lim ited am ount of progra m funds were set aside to support im plem entation gr antees by m aking available to them the tools they needed. For exam ple, if grantees said th ey needed case m anagem ent software, CHCF m ight sponsor a grant to develop generic s oftware that could be used by m ultiple grantees. Additional funds were m ade available by the early term ination of two im plementation grants. (Foundation staff comm ented that C MS discouraged work in one possible area\u2014risk adjus tment\u2014becaus e CMS had already done a lot of work in th at area.) T he National Comm ittee for Quality Assurance was also approached about providing f unds to develop care m anage ment guidelines. According to CHCF staff, the kinds of tools envisioned for support through these funds were not identified as needed by the gr antees, and dem and for such products was low. It is likely that the absen ce of a dedicated program office in the early years of PEMC cont ributed to the absen ce of initia l plans for the use of these f unds. (The ro le of the pro gram office is discus sed in Section D of this chapter.) Ultim ately, these funds wer e used by the Foundation for grants that related to the purposes of PEMC in a num ber of different ways. 43 1. Use of Funds for Related Activities Three related-activity grants were funded. One supported a test for instrum ents to be used in the national PACE program to m easure satisfacti on with quality of care for frail elders. They included one regular instrum ent and one targe ting those with m ild to m oderate cognitive impairment. The investigator was co -located at On Lok Senior Hea lth Servic es, the origin ator of the PACE c oncept and an inde pendent participant in PEMC. CHCF cofunded the developm ent and testing of the instrum ent with the Arch stone Foundation. The im petus for the project apparen tly was the inte rest in a too l that cou ld help PACE projects m eet a federal requirem ent mandating that consumer satisfaction be assess ed. Under the grant, the tool was developed, tested, and s ent to a ll sites; the availability of a successf ul model f or data colle ction f rom mild to moderately impaired ind ividua ls is o ne of the major adv ances noted f or the ins trument. At th is stage, the tool's long-term valu e appears uncertain. Reportedly, th e instrum ent is expensive to field and its utility varies for adm inistrativ e staff (who look for quick m easures of m any dimensions of perfor mance) and providers (who want operational detail). The grantee does not have funding to m onitor im plementation but ho pes that the shelf life of the instru ment will b e long as PACE expands and interests rem ain focu sed on the im portant issues that underlie the tool's developm ent. The other two grants involved operational in terventions w hose design and outcom es are described in Chapter II\u2014Project IMPACT, whic h supported California's a dditional participation in a national depression m anage ment initiative of the Hartford Foundation; and U CLA GIM, which developed and tested evidence-based guidelin es for th e diabetes care of older persons. The Project IMP ACT collaboration was developed jo intly with CHCF. The Foundation's willingn ess to provide s upport for an addition al Kaiser site was conting ent upon adding the third non-Kaiser site, which they hoped would m ake the project generalizable beyond Kaiser 's unique m odel. The \"forced m arriage\" of diverse system s created so me tensions, though seem ingly not inordinately so. The UCLA GIM grant cam e about because the grantee was looking for funding and heard from David Reuben, a colleague at UCLA, that PE MC existed and m ight be looking to develop an additional project to focus on disease m anage ment. Related-activity grants suffered to an extent f or their la ck of a defined role in the program . For example, MPR learn ed of inconsistencies in having these grantees report along with implem entation grantees at m eetings some of the tim e but not at othe r tim es. The role of the prog ram office in supporting them was also not clear. Both Project IMPACT and anothe r project that was part of a national program faced tensio ns that resulted from competing pre ssures to fulfill the ne eds of the national progra m and to address unique California concerns. Th ese issu es arose m ost prom inently in rela tion to evaluation design and reporting of site-specific data. Both the Project IMPACT and the UCLA GI M related-activities gra nts appear to have enrich ed the learn ing fro m PEMC substantially. In particular, the projects introdu ced experienc e with dis ease-focused in terventions that provided a valuable cont rast to the m ore generic ca re manage ment focus of most of PEMC' s interventi ons. By involving participants from the related- activ ity g rants in p rogram meeting s, grantees a ppeared to have been encouraged to think m ore about the role of the ev idence base in support of interventions. Grantees also seem ed encouraged to think about the tradeoffs involve d in focusing heavily on particul ar needs, as opposed to trying to deal m ore generally with a set of frail elders with m any needs and com plicated conditions. Having both approaches represen ted in the room and having each focused on frail elders was particula rly valuable in a context in which care m anagem ent for Medi care b eneficiaries is 44 becom ing more prom inent, even th ough the focus is not always on th e needs of the frailest elders (Foote 2004; Alliance of Comm unity Health Plans 2004). This point will be discu ssed further in considering the long-term contributions of PEM C. 2. Use of Funds for Augmentation Gr ants to Implementation Grantees The other use m ade of flexible funding was to provide support for selected im plementation grantees to augm ent work be yond that covered by their initial grants. Three im plem entation grantees received up to $60,000 each m onies (see Table III.2). T hese grants provided an opportunity for im plementation grantees to pur sue targeted analysis designed to help learn m ore about the interventions tested. For Kaiser T riCentral, it allowed for a lengthier test and m ore analysis of the response to enhanced benefits for community services after the unantic ipate d initial f inding that su ch servic es were not heavily used. Fo r Sharp Hea lthCare, the funds allowed for the developm ent of a software tool based on the intervention. For LTCG, the funds allowed the team to learn more about why people used or did not use services and how feasible it w ould be to focus the program on a sicker population. Respondents from grantees receiving augm entati on m onies said that these funds were not part of their original grants because they cove red activ ities that were beyond the initial scope of work. As one respondent describe d the scenario, \"It's learning as you go along and developing a wish list an d a list of more question s.\" The augm entation monies helped prom ote this addition al learning by addressing new questions that arose as a result of the intervention. One respondent corroborates this and says of the additional wor k, \"We only r ealized [the need] once we got into the intervention.\" Anothe r respondent that used the augm entation monies develop case managem ent sof tware dds, \"As we went f orward, we rea lized th at ad dition al too ls would be helpf ul. The tools that w ere ava ilable in the m arket were expensive and did not provide the detail we needed, so we got the extra m oney to deve lop what we needed.\" The respondent noted, too, that PEMC staff was in terested in f unding th is additional work becau se they realized that it would both help the grantee and m ove the field f orward. Grantees sa y that the a ddition al monies provided by the augm entation grants helped to answer additional questions and confirm and e xpand insights into the original study findings. One grantee explained, \"I don't know what we'd have done without it. We would have been stuck.\" Another said that the additional m onies he lped to be tter target th e type of interven tion needed, given the problem s frail elders presen t. Had the augm entation m onies not been m ade available, m ost gran tee recip ients said that th ey would not have been able to do any additional work. Augm entation grants ap pear to have provided PEMC f lexibility to bu ild on existing grants that would enhance the knowledge that they ge nerated. Grantees generally learned about the availability of augm entation m onies from program office staff. Those receiving gran ts appeared to perceive the application pro cess differently. While one indicated that the effort involved a 45 TABLE III.2.

To s ome extent, the disparity in experience m ay reflect: the varied ability of grantees to prepare strong proposals; the inform al processes used to m ake such funds available; the resource dem ands at the foundation; and the funds available for the augm entation grants. As one grantee said, \"W hat happened with the augm entation monies is that th ey were available, and then all of a sudden, they weren't. An open window of opportun ity becam e closed.\" However, CHCF was also balancing the dem and for funding with a tim eline created to support a program wide evaluation. In the case of both related-ac tivity and augm entation grants, the ability to m ake ad hoc decisions on funding provided valuab le flexibility both to PEMC and to CHCF. In particular, the fact that these funds were available helped the program and foundation staff to capitalize on opportunities to strengthen the outco mes of PEMC and to address so me of the limitations that arose. W hile m ore up-front thought and systematic planning for their use could have helped, foundation staff reported that the use of these funds was discussed at the program advisory meetings without any resolution. C ertainly m ore cl arity on the role and availability of these funds would have m ade grantees m ore com fortable. 46 C. WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY FUNDI NG REL ATIVELY RIG OROUS INDIVIDUAL GRANTEE gran tees implem ented the inter ventions in such a way that th ey could be tested in a scientif ically rigorous m anner. Gr antees were required to include an independent evaluation as a core compone nt of the grant, and interventions were to be assessed using a random ized control design. All but one im plementation grant used such a design. The exception was the grant to th e Institute on A ging, which used a less dem anding, quasi-experim ental design developed as part of a larger national intervention (the Chronic Care Network for Alzheim er's Diseas e), which inclu ded IOA. The resu lts of these ev aluations are summarized in Chapter II, and project-specifi c outcom es are summarized in the indiv idual summaries of each i mplem entation grant (see App endix C). The role of evaluato rs in each of the implem entation and sim ilar re lated-a ctivities gra nts is reviewed here, and an overall assessm ent of the individual grantee evaluations is provided. 1. Staffing an d Role of th e Individual Grantee Evaluator The role of the evaluator differed across proj ects, even wh en the form of evaluation was relatively similar. Two of the nin e implem entation and related-a ctivities projects that reache IMPACT\u2014did not have evaluato rs design ated specifica lly for the PEMC grant, since they were part of national interventions for which an evaluation was done at the national level.31 Of the rem aining seven grants, four (JFCS, Sharp HealthCare, LTCG and Pacificare/Secure Horizons) had separate subcontract s with evaluators from other organizations (see T able III.3).32 Of the other three, one (Kaiser T riCentral) ev aluation was conducted by an evaluator who was a consultant w ith a grantee part ner (Partners in Care Foundation) and two (UCLA GIM and UCLA NPI) were conducted by the co-principal inves tigator. UCLA GIM did only a pilot test and UCLA NPI was independent of the orga nizations im plementing the intervention. Externa l contrac arp Health Care, LTCG, and Pacificare/Sec ure Horizo ns) were typically about 10 percent of th e total grant am ount. This am ount excluded im portant evaluation costs, such as those related to data collection. The rem aining separate evaluation subcontract (JFCS) was 50 percent of the total grant am ount, though the scope of work for this subcontract was m ore comprehensive and included both prim ary and secondary data collection. The stage at which the evaluator got involved in the project also varied. In three cases (JFCS, Kaiser TriCentral, and Sharp HealthCare), the evaluator drafted th e original evaluation 31 The eval uation of Project IMPACT was done e ntirely at the national level. Th e co-p rincipal investig ators and the proj ect d irector for the Institute on Ag ing's gran t did an evaluation of the PEMC g rant in ad dition to the larger eval uation. 32 Robert Newcomer, from the Uni versity of C alifornia at San F rancisco, eval uated two of the grants (Sharp HealthCare and LTCG). He was adde d to the second of th e gra nts at the suggestion of the program office, w hich was con cerned abo ut the initial ev aluation desig n. 47 III.3.

In two other cases (LTCG and Pacifica re/Secure Horizons) the evaluation design was developed during the planning grant, with the e valuato r helping to refine a design that was in place. Since the evaluation of Project IMPACT wa s done at the nation al level, staff from the PEMC-funded sites generally m ade m ajor decisions about the design and choice of outcom es in collabo ration with p rincipal inves tigators from the six othe r sites in the nationa l project, as we ll as with staff from Project IMPACT's UCLA C oordinating Center. F or the IOA' s gran t, each medical group developed its own intervention, which conform ed to the goals of the Chronic Care Network f or Alzheim er's Disease initiativ e. Howe ver, evaluation personne l at the n ationa l level of the Chronic Care Network for Alzheim er's Di sease formulated th e evaluation d esign for th e nationa l pro ject, and it appeared th at the re wa s little need for the ad dition al exp ertise of an evaluator hired specifically for the PEMC grant. Not surprisingly, evaluators viewed their contribution m ore positively when they were able to be involved from the beginning. The am ount of writing evaluators did for the final report also appear ed to have varied somewhat across pro jects. Of the five grants th at had ev aluators s pecific to th e PEMC grant, th e 48 evaluator was the prim ary author of the report on four of them (JFCS, LTCG, PacifiCare/Secu re Horizons, a nd Sharp HealthCar the rem aining grant ( Kaiser TriC entra l), the e valuato r was not directly involved in writing the final report. There was n ot sufficient inf ormation to f ully ass ess which of these d iverse models is bette r. In general, experience suggests that both having the ev aluator invo lved from the beginning and using an evaluato r with experience carrying o ut rigorous evaluations in re al-world settings is important. 2. Assessment of the Individual Gr antee Evaluation Requirement In general, grantees that were interviewe d, both evaluators and others, were supportive of the inclusion of this type of form al eval uation design, even though the outcom es were disappointing to them . Som e said a rigorous evaluation was esse ntial in identif ying that an intervention did not work, so that attention c ould be focused elsewhere. For the m ost part, evaluator reports suggest that developing a sound ev aluation design is feasible for these kinds of interventions, though issues exis t (such as getting consistent data from physician offices and bridging the privacy wall betw een provider and evaluator). More challenging is the task of assuring that the project evaluated is soundly designed and structured in a way that warrants a rigorou s evaluation. Several evaluators expressed disappoin tment with the design of th e interventi ons tested, th ough they did not necessarily m ake their concerns known a t the start. General care manage ment interventions, in particular, were often perceived as inade quately built on an evidence base wi th unrealistic assum ptions about the likely success. The outcom es measured tended to be important ones from the perspective of key sponsors, such as purchasers or plans, but the changes sought or their m agnitude was not necessarily realistic. Even when grantees m et the goals for participation, the power to assess all relevant outcom es was often l acking (for example, long -term care use when power tests were defined by hospitalization rates). In som e cas es, grantees wondered if m ore testing for interm ediate outcom es could be valuable. Specific features of a project could also be problem atic from an evaluation perspective. In some cases, key aspects of an intervention were lacking or inadequately im plemented, such as physician involvem ent. In other cases, the inte rvention m ay have been \"over designed.\" For exam ple, som e involved in Kaiser T riCentral's e fforts now recognize that the careful distinctions they tested among interventions di dn't differ all that m uch and de pended on the skills of the staff carrying them out. In hi ndsight, m ore powerful test s of a s maller num ber of distinct alte rnatives could have been better. Failure to account for preexisting care pa tterns (such as whether the intervention included system s that already stress ed exercise or control of diabetes) was another issue som e identif ied in retrospec t. Both too little targ eting (LTCG), or too m uch (if thos e targeted were already being m anaged), were issues participants perceived with diverse intervention s. The tim efram e for the evaluation was also a concern for som e grantees. The UCLA GIM intervention, which was star ted late r than othe rs as a r elated-activ ity g rant and f ocused on pilo t testing, was pushed for interm ediate outcom es as early as three m onths into the intervention (which had been delayed) so th at there cou ld be som e feedback for the MPR evaluation; staff were uncomfortable with this short tim e period. In another case, a grantee was concerned that the 49 12-m onth outcom es we re too early given the need for patien ts to de velop trus t in the ca re manager. Other grantees were also interested in a longer test; however, it is not clear that increased tim e would have resu lted in different outcom es because the interven tions them selves were lim ited as im plem ented. Many grantees went out of their way to comm end CHCF for their comm itment to th e evaluation requirem ent, as the opportunity to obtain foundation support for such rigorous assessm ent tends to be lacking. For clinical research ers, having such a random ized control trial is the \"gold standard\" when assessing evidence fr om demonstrations. The inclusion of rigorous evaluations undoubtedly help ed the program in its dissem ination, m aking publication easier. (See Section E of this ch apter for more on this top ic.) Views on the role and form of evaluation have evolved to som e extent since the ev aluations were initiated for PEMC. Berwick, for exam ple, argues the m erits of conducting sm all, local tests (which he described as \"Plan, Do, Study, Ac t\") as an alternative to random ized design (or simple implem entation without reflection or evaluation) (B erwick 1998). Though random ized trials m ay be good for a final test of well-craf ted, unitary changes, he argues they are less appropriate when the intent is to develop the ch ange or to adopt a prov en treatm ent in a local setting with its own conditions. Others have si milarly focused on such m odels in encouraging improve ments in chronic care delivery (W agner, et al. 2001). These distinc tions appear relevant to the PEM C context in which, it a ppears, some interventions could have benefited from more flexible pilot testing and refinem ent prior to fo rmal testing. Others, perh aps, did not sufficiently reflect the s tate of the art. Developing evidence-based interv entions appears particularly ch allenging in trying to m eet the need s of frail elders. The ch allen ges of m ounting su ccess ful case m anagem ent interven tions are well recognized. So ar e the disagreem ents between those who accept (apparen tly as a m atter of faith) that they work and others, who believ e (apparently equally str ongly) that they don't. One source of the conflict s tems from the rela tive im portance placed on clien t and caregiv er perceptions versus influence on overall costs and patient outcom es. A bridge across these competing concerns would be to use the kinds of interactive m odels now proposed to encourage change to ex plore ev idence-bas ed interventi ons that can accommodate complex needs. D. WHAT WERE THE STRE NGTHS AND W EAKNESSES OF THE WAY T HE PROGRAM WAS ADMINISTERED? PEMC was t he first grant program commissione d by CHCF. As a newly formed foundation, CHCF wanted to quickly and vi sibly assert its pres ence as a grant-m aking organization. PEMC was developed very rapidly. At the start, th e program was adm inistered internally by th e Foundation under the direction of Jan Eldred and later under Andr ea Gerstenberger. After CHCF staff m embers realized that th eir oth er work resp onsibilities lef t them too little time to ef fectively carry out the task of m anaging PEMC activities, the Foundation es tablished a program office at UCLA, where David Reuben and Janet Frank di rected the program . Key activities of the program office included: (1) support for review of Cycle 2 grant proposals; (2) m onitoring and support of ongoing grants; (3) plan ning and dissem ination activities for the program as a whole; and (4 ) tech nical ass istance to grantees. (See A ppendix A f or more detail. ) This section rev iews findings about the effectiveness of the adm inistrative infrastructure on which the program functioned. 50 1. Effect ivene ss of the Gr ant Givin g and Reach of the Solicitation From what grantees told MPR about how th ey learned of PEMC grants, it appears that CHCF was successful in \"getting the word out.\" Bo th for mal and inform al routes were used to reach people. Having an advisory p anel that incl uded a m ix of relevant leaders and s takehold ers from California and els ewhere m eant that kno wledge of the forthcoming program was wel l diffused. (See Appendix A for m ore inform ation on the advisory panel.) Though the panel created som e poten tial conf licts because it included m any who would subm it grants, these conflicts were probab ly an effective tradeoff for gaining support for the program and interest in participa tion. The ability to evalua te the gran t giving was, of course, lim ited by the fact that MPR had access on ly to inform ation on those s uccessful in receiving g rants, no t on those who either did not know about the poten tial or who were not successful. The application process appeared to have been a bit chao tic, particularly in Cycle 1, because CHCF was so new and b ecause p rocedures were still being d eveloped. A s one grantee observ ed, \"In the beginning, they were kind of new at this, but it was never really a problem \u2014just not that sophisticated.\" Those f amiliar with other gran t prog rams (as m ost were with only a few exceptions) differed in their assessm ent, noting the comparative eas e of CHCF versus others they had been involved with. For the m ost part, resp ondents perceived the gran t application process positiv ely, with clear application rules that they thought were not very cum bersom e. The Foundation was com plimented on its flexibility, collabora tion, and attention to evaluation and improve ment. Those less com plimentary expressed frustration that som e rules changed and that they found the applications to be m ore complicated than other f oundations. The fact that interviewees differed in points of reference prob ably con tributes to the v ariation in p erspec tive, with interviewees spanning sm all community-bas ed groups to large m anaged care organizations and experienced res earch grant seek ers. The long delay between applicat ion and award was probably the most consistent criticism . In general, the application process appears to have been sm oother in Cy cle 2, though this cycle also involved a lengthy tim e betwe en applicat ion and award. CHCF s taff say that the tim e between app lication and award was, for the m ost part, consis tent with the way the timing f or the program was originally planned. 2. Role of Program Office and Program Infrastructure For the m ost part, g rantees believ ed that establishing a separate program office had a positiv e effect on the pro gram, although som e said the \"extra layers \" were an inevitab le tradeoff. While the transition was perceived to have worked re lative ly well, som e said that, in the f uture, it would be better if a program office were to be us ed, but to have it in place from the beginning. Without that, grantees had to learn new ways of relating part way into the program. This was especially true because the program office staff, by design, had m ore time to devote to oversight of the program and took a m ore \"hands-on\" ap proach than had foundation staff when they ran the program directly. Views of the program office generally were pos itive, though there were exceptions and areas mentioned that needed im prove ment. Most credite d the program office for their f lexibility in allowing gra ntees to le arn and their willingn ess to provide h elp when asked (f or example, with getting physician data). The UCLA team generally was well respected, a nd grantees appreciated 51 their oversight. One observed, \"The involvem ent of the UCLA program offi ce m ade an enorm ous positiv e benefit. I saw the program evolve over tim e. At the beginning, it was weak and vague on the science side. UCLA im proved th is. The program got better and m ade projects more accou ntable. \" There were som e criticism s, however. Grantees ' views of the respons iveness of th e office varied; some noted that the program office staff were very responsive, while others either found communication m ore difficult or w ere confused ove r the respective ro le of the p rogram office and foundation staff. One credited the program office for not being \"nitpicky,\" while another suggested \"less m icromanagem ent\" would have b een better. Grantees of a few projects that appeared to have been struggling were m ore cr itical than others; they perceived the program office staff to be unsupportive. For exam ple, one grantee said, \"The pr ogram office was critical of the fact that we weren't m eeting goals. They didn't seem to understand the difficulties we ran into.\" On the other hand, foundation staff percei ved that som e grantees were reluctant to acknowledge problem s or accept technical assistance. The most common criticism s across all grantees appeared to relate to: (1) getting feedback late about requirem ents for m eeting presentation s; and (2) having additional requirem ents placed on their projects after the fact. The latter appears especially relate d to requests for public ations and for data to support the program office's m eta-ana lysis, a nd to th e review of m anuscrip ts by the program office. The fact that manuscripts were reviewed was an issue for som e grantees; and, program office staff noted that getting these m anuscripts was difficult, particu larly in a form acceptab le for publication . The program office appears to have been mo st visible to grante es through the annual meetings. Participan ts varied in their views of these meetings, perhaps reflecting general differences across respondents in their relative interest in any for m of bi g meeting. Som e were highly positive about the experience. As one noted, \"They brought people together.\" Another remarked that the m eetings help ed \"seed a field of innovation\" wi th \"chances for grantees t o communicate and share experiences .\" One gran tee, whose planning grant had ended, said that they app reciated being included in the m eetings and believed that their inclusion gave them a chance not only to find out what was going on, but also to continue to have the \"opportunity to share ideas and inform ation.\" W hile grantees appreciated gett ing inform ation on what other grantees were doing as a core part of the agenda , som e said that having short presentations on projects was less preferable to having m ore tim e for interaction and discussi on of relevant issues. The program office appeared to have been m ost relevan t to implem entation g rantee s. While those with planning grants were invited to at tend the m eetings, m ost planning grants were completed by the tim e the program office was crea ted. Even those planning grants that were complete appeared, for the m ost part, to have limited interac tion with the progr am off ice. Related -activity g rantees also repo rted less in teraction with the program office than did the implementation grantees. Also, as noted previ ously, when grantees we re part of national program s, tensions arose in m eeting any specific expectations for California data or PEMC- specified inform ation. Grantees perceived, for the m ost part, that the program office was focused on the annual meetings and on m onitoring activities. W hile som e grantees went out of their way to indicate gratitude for help receiv ed in respon se to problem s they rais ed with the office, m ost said they had not requested specific assist ance. Others s aid th at the re were areas in which additional assis tance would have been va luable . One spec ific are a mentioned was in stitutional review boar d 52 approval, an issue that was m uch larger th an m any sites had anticipated. Another, particularly from planning grantees and especially from those dealing with dual eligibles, was th e desire f or more general access to t echnical as sistance. A n umber of pl anning grantees also said it would have been useful to them to have had m ore explicit m idcourse benchm arks for assessing progress and for getting feedback on their perform ance. Structu ring the program to involve com petitio n for im plementation grants m ay have com plicated the task o f providing technical as sistan ce, as giving technical assistance could have caused these com peting organizations to perceive the assis tance as an unfair advantage. However, gi ven that the planning gr ants were designed, at least in part, to im prove planni ng grantees' potential for successf ul im plem entation, providing as much technical as sistance as needed would have both been consistent with the goal of the planning grants and would have im proved the planning grant process. More dedicated focus on technical assistance and guidance to grantees was a suggestion made by a num ber of evaluators. These evalua tors were responding to what they saw as inconsistencies between often wea k and not very stru ctured inte rventions tha t were being rigorously evaluated. 3. Grantees' S ense of Community Because of PEMC's use of annual m eetings a nd newsletters, and its geographical focus on California, MPR asked grantees about any sens e of community that th is program m ay have created. PE MC grantee s that were inte rviewe d generally said they believed the program had created a sense of community, though their vi ews on its strength and im portance varied.33 Implementation grantees were m ost likely to pe rceive such a sense of community. About nine out of ten interv iewed f elt this wa y, which compar ed to only one in four of those in related activ ities in which ther e typica lly was a separa te national program or other audience for their work as well. Overwhelm ingly, respondents said th at the grantee m eetings were responsible for creating this sense of community.34 One respondent highlighted this by saying, \"It's funny because, for exam ple, Kaiser and PacifiCare are com petitors; bu t it was nice to talk about common issues and challenges.\" Few respondents believed that the sense of community developed through PEMC is sustainable now that funding has ended. One respondent said, for example, \"There are a lot of relationsh ips that will be sustained, b ut I'm not sure about th e group as a comm unity.\" Another added, \"I'm not optim istic, given the dem ands on each of the organization s. The fact is that m ost players are wearing m ultiple hats. I do think th at everyone rem embers the network and would feel comfortable con tacting fellow grantees.\" Other respondents supp orted these comments, saying that with the relationships that deve loped as a result of PEMC, people would be comfortable contacting each other. Others said, too, that because there is a relatively sm all circle 33 Que stions on this topic were aske d only of implementation and related-act ivity grantees, n ot of planning grant interviewees. 34 These m eetings i nclude d the annual m eetings as well as other m eetings of grantees, s uch as the Dissem ination Summit h eld in October 2003 . 53 of people that do the kind of work that was the focus of PE MC, people know each other and will continue to work togeth er on other efforts. Respondents varied in their views of the im portance of community to the success of program s like PEMC. More than half of the r espondents said that it is not im portant. Several noted that P EMC projects were so different a nd that grantees were doing their \"own things,\" which m inimized the importance of having a sens e of comm unity. For exam ple, one said, \"I don't think that they have to have a sense of comm unity, but they need to know who else is doing work in the sam e field.\" Another said, \"We had so m any pl ayers that trying to connect with another group of people would have been ha rd and not im portant.\" A sense of comm unity was particularly im portant for about one-third of the grantees. The particular appeal was the sense of being part of som ething bigger than the individual projects. As one respondent observed, \"Any tim e that you don't feel alone in the design or evaluation of som ething\u2014it's positiv e.\" T he rem aining respondents did no t have an o pinion as to whether a sense of community was im portant or not. 4. Grantees' View s of CHCF in the Context of the Program For the m ost part, grantees credited CHCF fo r giving them clarity and consistency over tim e in their goals as they related to PEMC. They were also unive rsally positive about the CHCF staff working on PEMC over tim e. Som e typical comments include, \"This has been m y first experience working with them . It's been nothing but delightful,\" or \"C HCF staff is wonderful, and they have been al l along.\" One grantee who was som ewhat negative about the program office said about CHCF staff, \"They are sm art, thoughtful, and knowledgeable.\" A nother, despite having been turned down for an implem entation grant, said tha t \"wo rking r elationships with CHCF were very positive, especi ally com pared with governm ents, but even com pared with other foundations ...There was a lot of flexibility wh en we ran into problems. Even tho ugh we were turned down , we still have a good positiv e relations hip with them .\" Anot her credited CHCF for arranging to fund the UCLA sta ff, who they said, \"kept us on our toes...with ve ry sm art people and...a lot of good suggestions.\" The only real criticis m cam e from som e researchers ac tive in the program who were disappointed that, from the resear chers' perspective, CHCF had not m ade m ore of an effort to solicit grants that went beyond the traditional loosely structured care m anagem ent models shown to be weak. They also criticized the failure to complem ent CHCF 's strong support for individual grantee evaluations with equa lly strong guidance and directi on for the actual interventions. However, this f eature, at leas t in part, ref lects the delibe rate dec ision to allow f lexibility a s opposed to the m ore prescriptive ap proach favored by som e foundations. 5. To What Extent Has P EMC Achieved Its Dissemination Goals? CHCF sought to use PEMC as a m odel for the nation in learning how to build on the growth of Medicare m anaged c are and link it with commun ity-based services to i mprove care for frail elders. While the prem ise of a g rowing Med icare m anaged care sector nationally has not materialized, the interest in im proving care for frail elders through m ore effective care delivery remains im portan t today . Theref ore, evalua ting h ow well the program is achiev ing its goals f or diverse m odes of dissemination to the target aud iences is im portan t. 54 With PEM C just ending and evaluations just bei ng finalized at the tim e of this repor t, it is not possible to comm ent fully on the question of dissem ination\u2014a goal im portant to CHCF. At this stage, P EMC's efforts to di ssem inate appear appropriate. As a result of annual m eetings and the newsletter, grantees appear well aware of the experien ce of other grantees. Dissem ination of the experience of particular work has been e nhanced by the involvem ent of national groups. For exam ple, the UCLA GIM effort to develop guidelin es for seniors with diabetes benefited from the national advisor and cosponsorship of the Am erican Geriatrics Soci ety. Articles describing the program have appeared in peer-reviewed journa ls (see T able III.4). Proj ects that are part of nationa l program s, like Projec t IMPACT, with m ultiple site s, hav e been esp ecially well repres ented. The experience of PE MC grantees appears to have been well repre sented in th e program s of relevant national groups, particularly involving geriatrics. The program office gets particular credit for encouraging and proddi ng the developm ent of such activities. Notwithstan ding the suc cesses to da te, th e ability to pursue dissem ination goals for PEMC faces challenges. In m any cases, with grant fun ds ended an d evaluation s com plete, there are no additional plans by indivi dual grantees to publish or dissem inate the work. Incentives to publish are particu larly lacking for m ore operationally based organizations and for investigators for whom publishing is not a prim ary interest or capability. W ithout an additional push (and potential support) from the Foundation, som e worthwhile learning m ay not be conveyed. Further, knowledge of PEMC to date can be viewed as m ainly \"among the converted.\" Inform ation on the program is best known to t hose California-based plans, providers, and community organizations that were interested enough to begin with to want to participate in the program . Outside Calif ornia, know ledge is m ost widespread am ong a cadem ics and national organizations that are focused ve ry direc tly on geria tric care. In addition, there has been lim ited work to date to abstract particular tools or findings from PEMC that m ay have broader application. A key challenge for PEMC is to move know ledge of PEMC and its lessons beyond the immediate audience of California-ba sed plans, program s, and nationa l attend ees a t geria tric care meetings to the broad er nationa l aud ience. W ith other m eans of controlling costs or enhancing care out of favor, there is incr easing in terest at the national level in quality improvem ent, especially in im proving care for ch ronic illness patients and for t hose with above-average needs, like th e frail aged that are the focus of PE MC. Awareness of PEMC appears low am ong these audiences and current dissem ination does not reach them . The challenge then is to convert the experien ce of PEMC into findings and lessons that can be relevant to a broader audien ce an d to a set of policy issues. W ith the program winding down, CHCF has begun to consider the broader quest ion of moving relevant findings forward. The Leadership Summ it that CHCF convened in Oc tober 2003, with grantees and other selected stakeholders, was a good start in exam ining th e project findings to identif y particular tools/findings that m ay have broader applicati on. The program office has de veloped a list of such tools, and CHCF is considering develo ping a web site to dissem inate them . 55 TABLE III .4.

Note: UCLA NPI and t he National PACE Asso ciation had not published an y articles rela ted to th e PEMC grant when thi s report was written . 57 But while there is pote ntial valu e to the f ield in m aking som e of the tools and concepts developed by PEMC available m ore broadly, the most importan t lesso ns from PEMC m ay rest elsewhere. One program participant observed af ter the last m eeting th at developing business plans for interventions\u2014which in their pure form are often \"tired old stuff\"\u2014is not the answer because there is little in most of the m odels to \"replay...[without being ] refined and retested.\" Potentially s ome of the most valuab le lesson s of PEMC stem from its failu res, sin ce these can be very valuable to others. The MPR evaluation is viewed by foundation staff as particularly valuable in extending k nowledge of PEMC's less ons to a b roader aud ience. This to pic will be covered in Chapter IV, which focuses on the conclusions from this evaluation. E. WHAT LESSONS CAN BE DRAW N FOR EFF ECTIVE P ROGRAM DEVELOP MENT FO R FRAI L ELDERS? MPR's evaluation of both the strengths and the weaknesses of PEMC hi ghlight a number of areas that are im portant to consider in future programm ing for frail el ders. Readers should note that these p oints are no t an ass essment of PEMC since th e list draw s both on what PEMC did well and that which m ight have im proved the pr ogram had it been included. W hile funders are the prim ary audience for these lessons, those seeki ng to pursue innovations in care for frail elders may also find m any of them valuable. Clearly define the program goals, the l ogic of the interventions, the expected outcom es, and the ev idence base on which thes e elem ents rest before d eciding to g o forward. That is, it is very im portant to unde rstand the logic of the processes that need to intervene between grant and outcom e and the strength of the evidence to support the intervention. Invest in developing solid clinical guidel ines and tools to support the program or individu al interven tions . Even if care needs involve m ultiple com plex condition s, consider focusing on a single defined poi nt of reference\u2014lik e dem entia, falls, depression, or diabetes care for those who are frail\u2014to expedite the developm ent of guidelines and the targeting of care based on needs. Seriously explore alternative ways of ta rgeting the individuals (such as patients and/or their caregivers) that are appropriate for the intervention, with a view toward determ ining which patient identif ication cr iteria provide the best balance between intervention costs and burden, and its likely payoff. Work with potential grantees and allow su fficient tim e to ensure that the proposed intervention s can be implem ented in an appropriate period of tim e and that the environm ent is well suited to effective execu tion. Assum e that, to be successful, intervention s will have to be consis tent w ith th e stra tegic dir ection and business ne eds of each org anization. (This was on e reason for which Foundation staff say they let organizations develop their ow n evaluations and contract wi th evaluators directly.) Work to encourage appropriate partnershi ps and collaboration am ong organizations demonstrating solid leadership and a comm itment to the project and processes. 58 Give serious consideration to including a planning grant or a planning phase with time and resources th at are commensurate with the task and the organization 's capabilities. Assum e that th e cha lleng es will alwa ys be grea ter than anticip ated. Despite the tem ptation, don't be seduced into expecting outcom es that are m ore ambitious than is likely to be supported by the intervention, environm ent, or ti me frame. Look f or short- term intermediate measures of outcom es that m ay indicate whether or not a given intervention has prom ise. Anticipa te adversity. Seek to ensure that the in tervention's success is n ot dependen t on a few people but has organizational support, an established process to institutionalize the support, and a solid foo ting in helping participants further their business objectives. Consider bu ilding in fiscal f lexibility, as available in PEM C, to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or findings that warrant further exploration. Be aware that joint funding of interven tions not only provide s opportunities to leverage available resources, but also genera tes risks asso ciated with differences in funding goals that could com plicate executi on by grantees and/or make it m ore difficult for the local foundation to get the inform ation it needs. If a program is to hav e a central coor dination point (such as a program office), estab lish it from the be ginning, select a well-respected ind ividual comm itted to the program goals to lead the office, and pr ovide resources sufficient for the task. Establish expectations from the start on any data, m easures, or evaluations needed to satisf y internal and e xterna l nee ds, and stay consistent over tim e on these expectations. Incorporate incentives and opportunities fo r sharing grantee experiences, and dissem inate inf ormation in a well-ta rgeted way to additional audiences of interest. Don't assum e that each grant needs to suc ceed for th e prog ram to be su ccessful; both successful and unsuccessful e fforts can teach som ething. Be prepared to invest in making the most of the opportunity. 59 IV. CONCLUSIONS AND LES SONS A. OVERALL CONCL USIONS ON PEMC The first of CHCF's grant program s, PEMC en couraged partnerships between m anaged care organizations, provider groups, and community ba sed service organizati ons with the goal of improving care delivery for frail, at-ris k elders in Medicare managed care. Both the individual grantee ev aluations and MPR's evaluati on show that PEMC was an ambitious program with a good concept that produ ced m odest results. F rail elders, the focus of PEMC, are without a doubt an im portant population with regard to program developm ent. Their needs are great, the costs to se rve them are high, their num bers are growing, and the care they now receive is widely p erceived to be lacking in a num ber of i mportant ways (Andersen and Knickm an 2001; Casolino, et al. 2003; Chen, et orkgroup on Care Managem ent 2002; Reuben 2002; Wagner, et al. 2001). T he Institute of Medicine lists care coordination as an im portant cr oss-cutting priority for nationa l attention, along with frailty associated with old age and chronic illness (Insti tute of Medicine 2003). The needs addressed by PEMC are at least as relevant today as when the program began. With PEM C, CHCF s ought to take advantag e of the California environm ent and its experience with risk-based m anaged care. Inte rventions organized through Medicare m anaged care should be m ore open to innovation, even t hough plans are still constr ained by the need to control costs and by Medicare's acute care benefits (T hornton, et al. 2002). Incorporating community-based providers and ph ysicians in to this enviro nment are ingredients m any view as important to success (Wagner, et al. 1996; HMO Workgroup on Care Managem ent 2002). The resulting program , PEMC, appears to have been well run and financed by a foundation with a strong, clear vision and supported by both in fluential grantees w ho worked hard to m ake their ideas a reality, a program office set up to help them do so, a nd an outside panel of experts position ed to provide access to ex isting knowled ge in the area. Yet, few of the pro jects resulted in m eaningful change in patient outcom es. Als o, while som e important tools, guidelines, and education were generated, m ost efforts have not been sustained. The question, theref ore, is: W hy wasn't th is more succes sful? In retrospect, the outcom es sought by PEMC were probably too lo fty relative to the intervention s tested, the speed with which they were developed, and th e existing knowledge on how to both im prove care for frail elders an d finance those im provem ents. PEMC's goal\u2014 improving care for frail elders\u2014 is a challengin g but im portant task. CHCF pursue d it for this reason and was encouraged by others to do so. The for m of the intervention\u2014better communication that linked m edical and social serv ice providers, with lim ited change in m edical practice (w hat Thornton and others term \"constra ined inn ovation\" )\u2014was well suited to the capitated environm ent in California (Thornton, et al. 2002). The decision to look at external returns, in term s of health outcom es and costs, was based on the m arket. In its planning, CHCF heard that if it could not m ake a business case for im proving care to fr ail elders, plans woul d have a hard time accepting the resu lts of any in terven tion and taking th e next s tep. But PEMC grante es gen erally could not achieve this am bitiou s goal. 60 In addition to the fact that th e goa ls were very am bitious, CHCF was probably not well position ed to achiev e them, since doing so wo uld m ean resolving wea knesses in d elivery that others before have failed to overcom e. CHCF was a new foundation that aim ed to move quickly. CHCF's de cision to give grantees flexibility was an understandable response to grantee's interests in m ore flexible st rategies that left m ore room for innovation than prescribed interventions. But flexibility m ay have diluted the em phasis on encouraging m aximum use of evidence in both structuring th e interven tions and defining the outcom es. The a bsence of a program office from the start lim ited the support available to grantees. And, having only two closely spaced cycles of grants lim ited the am ount of learnin g that was a vailab le to improve the program over tim e. In retrospect, it m ay have ma de m ore sense to invest in developing m odels before entering a large-sc ale test of the m odels. CHCF's experience is by no m eans atypical. Entities that f und interventions often want strong evidence of positive effects fr om their invest ment, and they want that evidence relatively rapidly. Achieving organizat ional change is difficult, however. The PEMC experience is a telling exam ple of both how ha rd it is to establish inte rventions f or frail elders in a way that serious ly affects the care they receive and that it is even harder to do so while generating short-term savings. B. LESSONS FOR CHCF AND CA LIFORNIA PLANS/PROVIDERS 1. What PEMC Gives to Build On PEMC was CHCF's first program . While the ou tcom es are disappointing given the effort that went into the program and the expecta tions, PEMC established the Foundation as both a presenc e and an im portant particip ant in the ef fort to im prove health ca re in Calif ornia. It also contr ibuted to CHCF's positiv e rep utation in California. Those af filiated with P EMC speak positiv ely of the Foundation, its staff, and their o wn experien ce with prog ram. The PEMC experience also lay s the basis for CHCF to f ollow throug h on the interest in improving care for frail elders in Ca lifornia, to the exten t that this is s till a goal. At a tim e when Medicare leaders are searching for ways to i mprove care for beneficiaries, CHCF's work has greatly expanded the ex perien ce of state leaders and providers with initiatives to improve care for frail elders beyond that of any other locale. Th e interventions tested by PEMC grantees notwithstanding, it is not clear th at they are any m ore lim ited th an those being pursued by m ost other groups. This potential m akes California a w onderful natural laborato ry for exam ining and developing insight into the ch alleng es asso ciated with im proving care for frail elders and the approaches that can realistically enco urage succes s. 2. Other Opportunities The PEMC experience suggests that there are at least three ar eas that offer opportunities for progress in care for frail elders: More Delib erate Development of Evidenced -Based Interventions That Focus on Frail Elders. The PEMC experienc e reinforce s concern that relati vely unstructured 61 and lim ited generic interventions involvi ng care m anagem ent are likely to yield limited resu lts. There is a danger, ho wever, th at frail elde rs will be lef t out of disease- based and highly targeted interven tions becau se of the complexity of their needs an d lack of clarity on how best to intervene. California's exp erience with develop ing diabetes guidelines under PEMC (along with the dem entia guidelines) is an exam ple of merging the inter ests in m ore targ eted a pproaches while keeping frail elders as the focus . Additiona l work consistent w ith this goal would do much to ensure that frail elders, am ong Medicare's m ost vulnerable subgroups, are not ignored as Medicare moves forward in encouraging pilo ts to im prove care coordination. Potentia l Base for Analysis of C are for Dual Eligibles. While program s directly focused on dual eligibles were not a priori ty for PEMC, a num ber of t he planning grants prov ide rich experience with the challenges of doing s o. The experien ce also shows that d espite the challeng es, in terest in b etter dual eligibles remains stro ng. Additio nal analys is of the experience of the m ore successful PEMC planning grants focused on dual eligibles could help to address questions facing policym akers today about the key barriers to success in building such program s. Opportunity to Learn More About Coordi nating Medical and Social Services. The financial barriers to integrat ing m edical and social serv ices are well known. A key part of PEMC's thrust w as to take advant age of California's ri sk-based environm ent to increm entally im prove coordination between m anaged care organizations and community-based providers of largely social services often not covered by Medicare. Further, the PEMC experien ce sho ws success in developing co mmunication acro ss these organizations. It would be valuable to learn in a m ore organized form about the potential constraints involve d in such coordinated effo rts given current funding stream s. Further study woul d arguably give C HCF an oppor tunity to learn how far managed care organizations are willing to go given fiscal realitie s and what is left undone. This inform ation could be useful at th e national level in better articulating the challenges for bridging the divide between m edical and social care d elivery for frail elders, particularly those without so me form of long-term care coverage. 3. Insight into the Use of Rigorou s Individual Grantee Evaluations It would be unfortunate if th e null findings from the PEMC individual grantee evaluations led CHCF to reje ct the use of such tests in the future. Such eval uations are ind eed the m ain way to dem onstrate whether an intervention is work ing\u2014som ething that grantees found very useful. The f ollowing lessons m ay be im portan t in ide ntifying when and how to be st use su ch evaluatio n tools. First, while flexibility is valuab le to grante es, an interest in a rigorous test of an in tervention by its nature m akes it desirable fo r CHCF to do m ore to specif y what it se eks to test or wha t potential grantees need to show for a dem onstration to be testable. Second, anticipated outcom es them selves need to be evidence based. The interest in quality- enhancing, cost-reducing outcom es is understa ndable in today's envi ronm ent, as only intervention s that m eet these criteria m ay be acceptable to payers. However, it m ay be difficult for many interventions to m eet this test ev en if they have other positive attributes. Determ ining 62 realistic expectations about outco mes can help funders decide, from the start, whet her anticipated outcom es make the intervention worth pursuing. The discussion also m ight lead to including other outco me measures, such as interm ediate changes in care, provider knowledge and satisf action, positive ef fects f or patients (r egard less of their costs), and lessons f or operation al design of system improvem ents. Such inform ation can help program part icipan ts and o thers determ ine whether the tested in tervention is either just not very good or good but just not ultim ately e ffective in r educing cos ts provi ng outco mes. However, such an alysis is on ly valuable if alternative ou tcom e measures ar e acc eptable to th ose who ultim ately will have to pay for them. Third, program participants should not underestim ate the substantial lead tim e and resources needed to plan, pilot, and build good interventions or overestim ate what is currently known about the form of effective intervention for the frailes t of elders. Developing and pilot testing tools th at can be useful in this area is very important, a nd arguably it is m ore important in the short run than evaluations to rigorously assess specific interventions. 4. Insight on Structuring Program Design and Oversight Program Design and Planning Grants . The preceding discussion highlights the importance of taking the tim e to identif y the s pecific inter ventions an d goals f or program s for frail elders (and probably m ost other progr ams as well). Though providing grantees with flexibility can be valuable and welcom e, featur es known to be im portant to the quality of the resea rch nee d to be spec ified in adva nce in ca lling for applic ants, and th ose weighin g the m erits of com peting applications may want to look carefully to judge the exten t to which a n applicant can introduce a sound intervention. S uch an exam ination could assess, for exam ple, whether case managem ent is to be a f ully integ rated com ponent of care delivery or m erely an overlay, as seem s to be the cas e for m any of the PEMC grantees. PEMC grant m aking m ay have involved a trad e-off between achieving a desired number of awards and the caliber o f projects. A smaller pool of grantees makes the risks of any one failing more serious. It could be that the more im porta nt lesson is less the sele cted num ber of grantees than the up-front tim e devoted to developing the intervention and applicant pool to help craft demonstrations with greater po tential for succes s. This strategy, however, requires a longer tim e horizon and a greater organizational comm itment , both from the funder and the applicant. Securing su ch a commitm ent could be dif ficult, par ticularly if turn over is an ticipated and markets are unstable. More extensive use of planning grants, for ex ample, like those h istorically u sed in demonstrations by som e large established f oundations (such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation) could p rovide a veh icle for testing th e prob able success of an interven tion before moving for ward. Though planning grants were in cluded in PEMC, their tim ing and the overall limitations o n new PEMC starts lim ited the Foun dation's ability to take a dvantage of them . The circum stances surrounding the start of PEMC were unique, and future progr ams are likely to face fewer constraints in m aking m ore use of planning grants. Program Office Responsibilities and Involvement. The PEMC experience highlights the value of using a dedicated program office fo r com plicated, multisite interventions. Foundation staff did not then, and probably do not now, have the tim e to provide such support or necessarily 63 the expertis e. The prog ram office estab lishe d for PEMC was well known and respected by program participants through their prior work\u2014a f act that served them well. Marrying part-tim e known staff with m ore comm itted junior staff is a comm on m odel that appears to h ave worked well here. A late start is obviously a feature that CHCF woul d not want to replicate in the future, since involvem ent from the start builds the capacity to shape the program a nd individual grantees at the start when the influence is most lik ely to b e effective. In the future, it would probably be useful to identify the b est way to b oth iden tify grante e needs for technical ass istance and to provide that assis tance. Th e difference between the program office's and the grantees' percepti on of technical assistance is striking. T he office perceives that it went out of its way to ask gran tees about their needs and to create opportuni ties for grantees to get assistance, while grantees who perceive that they needed assistance s ay they did no get it. A strong technical assistance com pone nt appears to be an essential com ponent to these types of grants. In the eyes of foundati on and program staff, efforts to identify the need for technical assistance and to provide it m ust be m ore pro activ e so that th e act of identifying the kind of assis tance n eeded in itself becom es the first step in provi ding assis tance. C. NATIONAL RELEVA NCE AND LESSONS The Program for Elders in Managed Care experi ence should be of considerable interest at the national level. As noted, the In stitute of Medicine has conclude d that efforts to improve care coordination are an important nati onal pr iority and th at frail el ders are an importan t target population (Institute of Medicine 2003a). De monstrations of how to redesign the delivery system so that it provides ongoing care that is coordin ated acro ss multiple pro viders\u2014 including acu te care, long-term care, and social services\u2014and supports patient self-m anagem ent are im portant (Institute of Medicine 2003b). Improving care m anagem ent is particularly im portant for Medicare bene ficiaries. In terest in this topic is high both in Congress and in CMS, which adm inisters Medicare. For several years, CMS has aim ed both to encourage coordinated ca re through enrollm ent in Medicare+Choice and to extend m anagem ent concepts via dem onstrations in the traditional M edicare fee-for-service program . With the enactm ent of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, interventions will be expanded (Alliance of Community Health Plans 2004). Quality improve ment program s that includ e chronic care are required in both Medicare Advantage (MA, for merly Medica re+C hoice) p e fee-for-service program . MA plans m ust include a m ethod for monitoring an d identifyin g enrollees with m ultiple or sufficiently severe chronic conditions. To expand ca re managem ent in the traditional Me dicar e prog ram, a pilot program involving a partnership between Medi care and private organizations offering coordinated care to large populations is to be established and evaluated by random ized trial (Foote 2004). W hile m odeled on ex perience with disease m anagem ent program s, the pilot will be allowed to m ove beyond the prim ary condition to address co-m orbidity and case m anage ment as well as disease m anagem ent. In addition, th e MMA provides authority to contract with specialized private plan s that focus on care for Medicare benefi ciaries with spec ial needs. The PEMC experience undersco res the im portance of well-st ructured, evidence-based intervention s to success ful outcom es and the part icular ch alleng es ass ociated with identifying and im plementing these interventio ns for frail elde rs. It is not cle ar from the PEMC experien ce whether th e inte rventio ns to be in cluded in the federal p ilots will be a dequate ly sc aled to the 64 ambitious policy goals set for them , particularly gi ven the sp eed with which they ar e like ly to be pursued and the lim ited scope of their author ity (espec ially for inte rventions ou tside provid er system s). Further, it is easier to d evelop inter ventions for relatively healthy people who can largely care for them selves but who have chronic care need s. Thus, it is possible that the p ilots will have an incentive to focus less on elders with ill-defined conditions and larger care manage ment needs than on other populations. If so, it m ay be that an im portant opportunity will have been m issed to improve care for frail elders . In addition, because frail elders account for a large proportion of Medicare spendi ng, it will be hard to contro l expenditures if program s do not adequately focus on this population. Though outcom es from the PEMC are generally disappointing, both the program and the literature supports the importance of programm ing that addresses ne eds of frail elders. Further, severa l of the projects highligh t the valu e of developing condition -specific gu idelines tha t take into account frailty, including the projects tha t targe ted patients with diabetes (UCLA GIM), depression (Project IMP ACT), and dem entia (UCLA NPI). In this con text, nationa l policym akers m ay find it of value to m onitor the rollout of coordinated care pilots and other demonstrations to assess the relevance of the interventions tested for th e frailest of elders. Further, becau se of the challenges associated with d eveloping effective interventions f or this population, CMS may want to consider whether it should cover some of the costs of developm ent since private entities m ay have insuf ficient f inanc ial incen tives to do so. 65 REFE RENCES Alliance of Community Health Plans. \"The Medicare P rescription Drug, Im provem ent and Modernization Act of 2003: A Review of Quality Related Provisions.\" W ashington, DC: January 2004.
