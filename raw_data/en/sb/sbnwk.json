Loving Essential Oils is an online aromatherapy blog that provides detailed information for new and experienced essential oil users. For more information please visit the website here: [https://www.lovingessentialoils.com/products/essential-oil-recipes-guide](https://www.lovingessentialoils.com/products/essential-oil-recipes-guide) Loving Essential Oils, a family-owned and operated company that is passionate about essential oils and a holistic way of life, is managed by Jennifer Lane, a Certified Aromatherapist. The founders made the decision to abandon traditional lifestyle and health products in favor of a natural approach. Essential oils have become an integral part of that lifestyle. They wanted to share their passion for essential oils with others, and to make it easy for them to use them safely and effectively in everyday life. They offer tutorials and blog posts to help readers get the most out of their oils. Additionally, they have created educational resources for customers so they can enjoy the many benefits of aromatherapy. Loving Essential Oils has launched a new guide for essential oils. This guide includes essential oil recipes to use them on the body and at home. Customers can find recipes for beauty and health products, as well as recipes that are suitable for one's home. One example is a chest rub made with eucalyptus to relieve congestion from people who have colds. A foaming facial cleanser is another recipe that uses natural ingredients and an old bottle. A DIY green cleaner recipe using tea tree oil, vinegar and other non-toxic ingredients is one recipe you can use at home. The guide contains only recipes for essential oils and other natural ingredients that are free of chemicals and toxins. Each recipe includes clear instructions and amounts. They also detail what equipment and vessels are required to make the products, as well as tips and tricks to help you personalize your products.
