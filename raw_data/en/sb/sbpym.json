Each treatment is tailor-made for an individual's unique needs. Unlike pharmaceuticals, herbal therapy uses the therapeutic benefits of the entire plant, rather than extracting one element for one symptom. Herbal Therapy often includes herbal remedies and supplements as well as hydration recommendations, lifestyle changes and detoxification practices for a better functioning body. This centuries-old treatment does more than pacify symptoms. Herbal Therapy targets the root cause of various issues for true wellbeing for all. "}
