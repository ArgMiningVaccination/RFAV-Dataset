When these three elements are in place, we become \"superhuman.\" The benefits of the revolutionary Superhuman Protocol (SP) are incredibly compelling, regardless of your age, health, or physical condition. What is the Superhuman Protocol? The \"Superhuman\" protocol is designed to optimize performance, heal injury, retard aging, and promote the highest level of physical and mental conditioning possible. It exposes your body to three of Earth's natural elements: Magnetism, Oxygen, and Light. In that order. It's a 35-minute protocol utilizing 3 technologies. 70% of the time you're lying down and relaxing. Why are These 3 Elements so Critical? Without magnetism, oxygen, and light we cannot survive. With them, we are \"Superhuman.\" The benefits are compelling no matter if you're 80, in a wheelchair, or a Gold Medal Olympian. Magnetism, oxygen, and light created life. However, Earth's magnetic field has declined 80% in the past 4000 years and we have further disconnected from it by wearing shoes. Earth's O2 levels are dropping and filled with hydrocarbons from the industry. We've blocked the critical light by wearing clothes and living in buildings. We are fish out of water. Our bodies are starving for the very forces that created us without even realizing it. This has resulted in a degenerative breakdown of the 11 organ systems and caused many negative health symptoms. When you expose the body to these natural elements, you can restore order. 35 Minutes a day can restore years of abuse. The Three Steps of SP The first session is PEMF (pulsed electromagnetic field) therapy, which takes 8 minutes. A body mat bathes you in a PEMF waveform that simulates Earth's magnetic field and multiple supportive frequencies. During this \"charge,\" your river of life may transport more oxygen and nutrients to the 11 organs. Benefits: - Improves blood flow - Improves lymphatic flow - O2 cells via ion transport - Brings cells to 25 mV - EMF cleaning - Detoxification - Grounding - Reduces pain During this part of SP, which takes 10-15 minutes, you'll exercise for up to 15 minutes, breathing 93+% O2, while doing interval sprints. When bathed in oxygen, tissue and micro-vessels come alive. Benefits: - Oxygen-rich environment - Decreases inflammation - Stimulates Immune system - Accelerates healing - Increases athletic performance - Helps O2 deficient illnesses - Optimal O2 transport when paired with PEMF therapy paired with PEMF therapy This third step, which takes 15-20 minutes, involves exposure to red and near-infrared light. You'll experience a relaxing, non-thermal session that consists of multiple wavelengths of light (Red 635nm, various NIR e.g. 810nm, 850nm & 940nm). Photons (light) are absorbed by the cell, which helps decrease damaging free radicals to optimize energy production at the cellular level. By exposing your body to these three natural forces, you can replenish your energy and restore your well-being. Benefits: - Reduces oxidative stress - Decreases Pain - Increases Energy/ ATP - Decrease inflammation - Increases muscle recovery - Improves metabolism - Improves mood - Improves Sleep - Anti aging effects - And so much more...
