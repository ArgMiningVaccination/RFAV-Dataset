AACP Standardized Survey: Faculty - Question 34 AACP Standardized Survey: Student - Questions -32, 34-36, 66, 67, 77-79 AACP Standardized Survey: Alumni - Questions 19, 22 Optional Do cumentation and Data: Other documentation or data that provides supporting evidence of compliance with the standard. Examples could include assessments and documentation of student performance, nature and extent of patient and health care professional inte ractions, and the attainment of desired outcomes; aggregate data from students about the type (diversity) and number of patients, problems encountered, and interventions; evidence of assuring, measuring, and maintaining the quality of site used for practic e experiences; and quality improvements resulting from practice site assessments. 2) College or School's Self -Assessment: Use the checklist below to self -assess the program on the requirements of the standard and accompanying guidelines: S N.I. U 12.1. Didactic curriculum - The didactic portion of the Pre -APPE curriculum includes rigorous instruction in all sciences that define the profession (see Appendix 1). Appropriate breadth and depth of instruction in these sciences is documented regardless of curricular model employ ed (e.g., blocked, integrated, traditional 'stand -alone' course structure, etc.). 12.2. Development and maturation - The Pre -APPE curriculum allows for the development and maturation of the knowledge, skills, abilities, attitudes, and behaviors that underpin the Educational Outcomes articulated in Standards 1 -4 and within Appendices 1 and 2. 12.3. Affecti ve domain elements - Curricular and, if needed, co -curricular activities and experiences are purposely developed and implemented to ensure an array of opportunities for students to document competency in the affective domain -related expectations of Standar ds 3 and 4. Co - curricular activities complement and advance the learning that occurs within the formal didactic and experiential curriculum. 12.4. Care across the lifespan - The Pre -APPE curriculum provides foundational knowledge and skills that allow for care across the patient's lifespan. 3 12.5. IPPE expectations - IPPEs expose students to common contemporary U.S. practice models, including interprofessional practice involving shared patient care decision- making, professional ethics and expected behaviors, and direct patient care activities. IPPEs are structured a nd sequenced to intentionally develop in students a clear understanding of what constitutes exemplary pharmacy practice in the U.S. prior to beginning APPE. 12.6. IPPE duration - IPPE totals no less than 300 clock hours of experience and is purposely integrated into the didactic curriculum. A minimum of 150 hours of IPPE are balanced between community and institutional health -system settings. 12.7. Simulation for IPPE - Simulated practice experiences (a maximum of 60 clock hours of the total 300 hours) may be used to mimic actual or realistic pharmacist -delivered patient care situations. However, simulation hours do not substitute for the 150 clock hours of required IPPE time in community and institutional health -system settings. Didactic instruction associated with the implementation of simulated practice experiences is not counted toward any portion of the 300 clock hour IPPE requirement. 3) College or School's Comments on the Standard: The college or school's descriptive text and supporting evidence should specifically address the following. Use a check to indicate that the topic has been adequately addressed. Use the text box provided to describe: areas of the program that are noteworthy, innovative, or exceed the expectation of the standard; the college or school's self-assessment of its issues and its plans for addressing them, with relevant timelines; findings that highlight areas of concern alo ng with actions or recommendations to address them; and additional actions or strategies to further advance the quality of the program. For plans that have already been initiated to address an issue, the college or school should provide evidence that the p lan is working. Wherever possible and applicable, survey data should be broken down by demographic and/or branch/campus/pathway groupings, and comments provided on any notable findings. How student performance is assessed and documented, including the nature and extent of patient and health care professional interactions, and the attainment of desired outcomes How, in aggregate, the practice experiences assure that students have direct interactions with diverse patient populations in a variety of health care settings How the college or school ensures that the majority of students' IPPE hours are provided in and balanced between community pharmacy and institutional health system settings How the college or school uses simulation in the IPPE curriculum How the college or school establishes objectives and criteria to distinguish introductory from advanced practice experiences. How the college or schools assures, measures, and maintains the quality of sites used for practice experiences How quality improvemen ts are made based on assessment data from practice sites Any other notable achievements, innovations or quality improvements Interpretation of the data from the applicable AACP standardized survey questions, especially notable differences from national or peer group norms 4 Curricular Design to Foster APPE Readiness The pre -APPE curriculum is designed to foster development of and maturation in foundational knowledge (e.g., biomedical, pharmaceutical, social/administrative/behavioral, and clinical sciences), skills , and abilities necessary for practice readiness . The sequencing of didactic, laboratory , and experiential courses is intentional and designed to build stepping stones to the next level of instruction (Figure 1 2-1). The curriculum is aligned to ACPE Appendix 1 of Standards 2016 ( Appendix 12A) with instructor's designat ing the depth of instruction as \"introduced, reinforced, applied or mastered \" for each Appendix 1 area . Interprofessional education ( IPE), discussed in Standard 11, is introduced early in the curriculum and reinforced consistently throughout ( Appendix 12B). The co -curriculum threads alongside the didactic coursework to augment and advance learning each year; focusing primarily on development and maturation of affective domain elements. Figure 12-1. Integration of Didactic, Laboratory, Co -Curriculum, and Experiential Education Co-Curriculum The co -curriculum is designed to complement, augment , and adva nce learning that takes place in the didactic, laboratory and experiential courses. It serves as the structure for learning alongside the formal curriculum, which allows for exposure and collaboration with other disciplines and is essential to develop the knowledge, skills and abilities, behaviors, and attitudes necessary to be a team -ready and practice- ready pharmacist. The co -curriculum consists of experiences map ped to program level Ability-Based Outcomes and ACPE Standards 3, 4, and 12. ( Appendi ces 12C-D). Organized by professional year and a particular area of focus, the co -curriculum includes required experiences as well as a menu of elective 5 opportunities, which students may choose from based upon their interests, experience, and professional goals. The focus of the co -curriculum for the P1 year is S elf-Awareness and Professionalism followed by Teams and Teamwork (\"Team Ready\") in the P2 year , and D irect Patient Care Practice Essentials (\"Practice Ready\") in the P3 year . Required components in the co-curriculum such as leadership application trainings, strengths assessments, and professional ceremonies reinforce the training students receive in important affective domain elements in their didactic coursework. Students reflect on their abilities in each of these focus areas each semester as well as their professional attitudes and mindset to foster growth in their self -awareness over time. At least one IPE experience is a required co-curricular element in each semester. Facu lty advisors are instrumental in assessing student maturation of attitudes and other Standard 3 and 4 components . Faculty advisors assess co -curricular reflections and artifacts using standardized rubrics and provide feedback to students each semester . Advisors also encourage students to thoughtfully choose co-curricular electives to maximize their professional growth in the affective domain elements. Students who fail to comply with all co -curricular requirements by the due date are reported to the School of Pharmacy Senior Associate Dean and receive a Professionalism Infraction. Effective spring 2020, failure to comply with all co -curricular requirements after a one week grace -period is treated as a \"course failure\" to ensure all students take the co -curri culum seriously. APPE Readiness Assessment Appropriate breadth and depth of foundational knowledge is evaluated throughout the curriculum and monitored . The C urriculum and Assessment C ommittees systematically evaluate the curriculum and implement needed changes to ensure quality of the program (Appendix 12E , also Standards 10 and 24). Foundational knowledge essential to provid e care across the lifespan is ensured via required didactic coursework in pathophysiology, pharmacokinetics (including the effec ts of aging), and in the renal course (PHRM 537) plus emphasis on pharmacotherapy for pediatrics and geriatrics in Special Populations (PHRM 520) in the P3 year . These concepts are reinforced and applied in Pharmacotherapy Lab (PHRM 545L) and Pharmacot herapy Capstone (PHRM 580) courses. A passing grade in each of these 2 courses is one marker for APPE readiness of each student in our professional curriculum. The PharmD Program Evaluation plan tracks a variety of APPE Readiness indicators which are reported annually and evaluated by the Curriculum and Assessment Committees (see table below) . In addition to IPPE I and II, student performance in didactic courses and on standardized exams are also considered. Course pre-requisites associated with course sequencing in the curriculum ensure that no stu dent progresses to the next course in sequence without having achieved a passing grade (a minimum of \"C\" and \"Pass\" in Pass/Fail courses) in the course(s) that precedes it. Courses at the end of the sequence plus those imparting specialized content such as PHRM 520 Special Populations are designated as \"key courses\". Averaging all summative assessments earned by successful students (e.g. those passing the course ) in each of the key courses serve as indicators of APPE readiness. To illustrate, in 2018-2019 the 6 overall average on summative assessments for students passing key courses ranged from 83 -88.4% which is considered acceptable . Data from PCOA exams show our P3 students consistently perform above the natio nal average support student performance in key courses. In addition, AACP G raduating Student s and Alumni Survey responses i n which the percentage of agreed/strongly agreed with the statement \"I was academically prepared to enter my APPEs \" far surpasses th e national average confirming other APPE readiness indicator results . Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPEs) A total of 314.5 IPPE hours are integrated within the first three years of the didactic curriculum and provide a scope, intensity, and duration that exceed the required standards for preparation for Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPEs) (Appendix 12 F). The IPPE learning program includes authentic direct patient care experiences, simulated patien t care experiences, and reflection (Figure 12 -2). The majority of IPPE hours are balanced between community pharmacy and institutional health system settings affording students significant direct patient care experiences in actual practice settings . This is supported by data from the AACP Graduating S tudent surveys in which the percentage of agree/strongly agree with the statement \"My introductory pharmacy practice experiences permitted my involvement in 7 direct patient care responsibilities in both community and institutional settings\" are consistently higher than the national average. Figure 12 -3. Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience Program Simulation activities are dispersed throughout the didactic curriculum and involve learning experie nces which are difficult to achieve in other IPPEs, but still require an introductory experience prior to APPEs (Appendix 12G ). Simulation activities are structured around a specific set of learning objectives and 8 student learning is assessed. The IPPE curriculum uses a variety of methods to deliver high quality simulation hours which develop pre- APPE competencies across multiple programmatic ability based outcomes, including the ability to work with other members of the healthcare team. Specif ically, the IPPE simulation curriculum includes one or more simulations with medical, nursing, dietetics, social work, and allied health professional students (See Standard 11 for details ). IPPE Student Performance Assessment Student performance during introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPEs) is assessed using standardized evaluation tools, including preceptor evaluations of students. In 2019, the preceptor evaluation was changed from an ABO-based evaluation with a f ive point Likert scale to a rotation -type specific entrustable professional activities (EPA) and ABO -based evaluation ( Appendices 12H -I). Assessment data from this new evaluation ( Appendices 12J -K) will be included in the 2019 -2020 programmatic assessment report. Preceptor evaluations of students are summative and sent electronically to preceptors. The minimum performance expectation with the new EPA format is a level of entrustment of 2: \" I trust the learner to complete this task with assistance. The learner requires frequent correction or feedback \". Professionalism questions on the final evaluation are scored yes/ no/needs improvement . The minimum performance expectation for professionalism questions is 'yes.' The Director of IPPE is notified electronically of any student not meeting minimum performance expectations. Student performance during IPPE is also assessed using faculty developed rubrics/assessment tools. The nature and extent of patient and inter professional interactions as well as exposure to divers e patient populations during community and institutional IPPE, in aggregate, is documented (and assessed ) using the IPPE Healthcare Professional/Student and Patient Interaction Survey and patient case l ogs ( Appendix 12L). An annual report of IPPE student performance as assessed by preceptors is provided to the Assessment Committee . In addition , a student lear ning assessment report is provided to the Curriculum and Assessment Committees every three years for all courses containing IPPE coursework as part of the course evaluation process. The strength of the IPPE program is s upported by data from the AACP Graduating Student S urveys in which the percentage of agree/strongly agree with the statement \"My intro ductory pharmacy practice experiences were valuable in helping me to prepare for my advanced pharmacy practice experiences\" are consistently higher than the national average. IPPE Quality Assurance Methods Quality assurance of the IPPE experiential education curriculum is assured through multiple methods. The experiential education program utilizes an Experiential Education Committee which includes experiential education directors, faculty members, and practicing pharmacists. Ability based objectiv es and criteria differentiating introductory and advanced institutional and community pharmacy practice experiences were developed in collaboration with Experiential Education Committee members based on student education level and skills sets necessary to be successful in experiential education experiences and the 9 practice of pharmacy (Appendices 12M - N). The Committee, along with additional preceptor input , review s differentia tion between introductory and advanced practice experience activities every 3 years as part o f a quality assurance process. Additionally, the E xperiential Education Committee routinely reviews and revises all IPPE rotation objectives, rotation activities, rotation assignments and evaluation criteria to ensure optimal student learning in experiential education and integration with didactic curriculum. The Experiential Education Committee, along with the Curriculum Committee, also review all simulated experiences that are included in the IPPE hour count. Quality assurance of the IPPE experiential education program practice sites is also assured through multiple methods . The methods used include one or more of the following: s tudent evaluations of preceptors/sites (Appendix 120 ), experiential education program criteria for the evaluation of sites/preceptors for student placement, site visits, electronic quality assurance methods, and mechanisms of providing feedback to preceptors. Assessment data, including quality assurance and preceptor /site evaluations , provide opportunities for individual preceptor/ site quality improvement through electronic, written, or verbal communication with the preceptor/site. The Director of Experiential Outreach and A ssessment is notified of sites/preceptors receiving low scores by student s in their evaluation of site/preceptor . The data is logged and review ed in coordination with the IPPE/APPE Directors (Appendices 12P -Q). Depending upon the low score notification received, student performance on the rotation and historical data concerning t he site/preceptor is reviewed and appropriate action is taken. Action taken may include one or more of the following: further discussion with student, phone/site visit, precept or education/training, and/or inactivation of site and removal of future students . All preceptors, including new preceptors, receive training information and updates regarding our program through eValue and are routinely offered opportunities for live pre ceptor training and/or preceptor training through written/electronic means. Quality assurance of preceptors/sites is discussed in further detail in Standard 20 and Standard 22. Finally, The Director of Outreach and Assessment solicits feedback during sit e visits and preceptor contacts related to student performance and IPPE/APPE readiness. This feedback is provided at routine intervals to the Experiential Education Committee and Curriculum Committee. Overall, the quality of IPPE is supported by data from the AACP Graduating Student S urveys in which the percentage of agree/strong agree with the statement \"My introductory pharmacy practice experiences were of high quality\" is consistently higher than the national average. Notable achievements in the pr e-APPE curriculum : Successful implementation of the co -curricular requirements Implementation of EPA based preceptor evaluation of student s in IPPE Expansion to 4 weeks of IPPE community pharmacy practice with an emphasis on communication with patients and providers. Increased quality and quantity of IPE focused activities within the curriculum, co -curriculum, and IPPE. Increased robustness in assessment of student learning outcomes in the pre-APPE curriculum. 10 4) College or School's Final Self -Evaluation: Self-assess how well the program is in compliance with the standard by putting a check in the appropriate box : Compliant Compliant with Monitoring Partially Compliant Non Compliant No factors exist that compromise current compliance; no factors exist that, if not addressed, may compromise future compliance.

Trouble -Shooting W elcome to the North Dakota State University College of Health Professions, School of Pharmacy Introductory and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE & APPE). Introductory and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences are designed to integrate, apply, reinforce, and advance the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values developed through the other components of the curriculum. The focus of the introductory rotations (IPPE) is to familiarize students with the technical aspects of medication distribution within institutional and community pharmacy practice settings. Advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) rotations during the final year of pharmacy school will build upon the knowledge base gained during the introductory experiences and will allow stu dents to focus primarily on the advanced pharmacist roles involved in the oversight of medication distribution within an institutional pharmacy practice environment. IPPE -I rotations consist of one three week rotation in an institutional setting for a total of 120 hours. IPPE -II rotations consist of one four week rotation in a community setting for a total of 160 hours. APPE rotations consist of eight five -week rotations for a total of 200 hours per rotation. Five of the eight rotations are required rotations consisting of one each of community, institutional, inpatient general medicine ( acute care ), ambulatory care, and rural rotations. The required pharmacy practice experiences must include direct interaction with diverse patient populations in a variety of practice settings and involve collaboration with other health care professionals. The additional three APPE rotati ons are considered \"elective\" rotations. Elective rotations are defined as any \"required\" rotation or any experience that will provide opportunities for students to develop professional skills and individual interests. Most pharmacy practice experiences must be under the supervision of qualified pharmacist preceptors licensed in the United States. Active preceptors are considered \"Adjunct Faculty Members in the NDSU School of Pharmacy.\" Thank you for being a pharmacy preceptor for NDSU! We value our partnerships with pharmacists from around the region and the excellent education they provide to the next generation of pharmacists.

It is recommended that this evaluation be discussed with the preceptor during the feedback session at the conclusion of t he rotation. These comments and observations will provide the preceptor with invaluable feedback regarding his/her site, service, and individual performance as a preceptor. Preceptors have the ability to view anonymous student evaluations of the preceptor /site through E*Value once a preceptor has had at least three students provide an electronic evaluation for the preceptor through E*Value. (see E*Value section of preceptor's handbook for directions) Preceptors, who have not yet received at least three ev aluations, can request verbal feedback and/or suggestions for improvement from our office. Preceptor Evaluation The \"Preceptor Evaluation of Student Form\", is to be completed by the preceptor. The preceptor is required to: 1. Provide the student with verbal, constructive feedback, midway and throughout the rotation. 2. Provide a written \"Student Evaluation\" and constructive feedback at mid -point (for APPE) and conclusion of the rotation 3. Post on the E*Value website, \"Student Evaluation\" within two weeks following the completion of each rotation. An electronic copy of the evaluations will be generated by E*Value and emailed to preceptors at the mid -point of the rotation and one week prior to the completion of the practice experience. **Please notify mark.lofgren@ndsu.edu if you do not receive these notifications from E*value as they sometimes go to junk mail. Grading: The Grading System used to monitor academic performance for the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences is: P (Pass): Indicates that the student has successfully completed the work of the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences F (Fail): Indicates that student performance was unsatisfactory or that the student did not meet the expectations and/or complete the required work of the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience. Students must complete and pass ALL course components to pass this course. Preceptor Eva luation of Students A. During any rotation, if a student puts patients, preceptors or th e practice at risk, that student may be immediately dismissed from the rotation and given a failing grade for that rotation. Students will not receive credit for failed rotation hours. Preceptors are asked to immediately notify Teri Undem, APPE Director (7 01- 231-6578) or Rebecca Brynjulson, IPPE Director (701 -231-7477) of any problems with their students or the rotation. B. Upon failure of an IPPE rotation, a student will receive a failing grade and the student will complete a remediation plan during the subs equent academic year that includes repeating the course for academic credit. The student will be required to successfully complete all IPPE hours prior to beginning APPE. A minimum of 300 IPPE hours must be successfully completed prior to APPE. C. Upon failure of an APPE rotation, a student will receive an incomplete grade and will be required to successfully complete a remediation plan that includes repeating the failed rotation type for APPE credit. Upon completion of the remediation plan, the student will b e required to make up any rotation hours that were missed due to the remediation plan. All make up rotation hours will be completed at the end of the academic year, resulting in a delayed graduation. Remediation hours cannot be made up over the holiday bre ak. A total of 1600 ACPE rotation hours, in the appropriate combination of required and elective rotations, must be successfully completed prior to graduation. D. If a student requires remediation and does not successfully complete the remediation plan, Colle ge Policy 3.03, Right to Terminate Enrollment, will be considered. APPE Remediation Policy IPPE -I (Institutional) Grading - see Syllabus IPPE -II (Community) Grading - see Pharm 455 Syllabus Monitoring Evaluation of the experiential experiences will be conducted in the same manner as all other courses offered by the College of Pharmacy. Students will be required to complete an electronic evaluation of the site, the preceptor and the program at the end of their experiences. Students are informed to immediately notify the APPE /IPPE Director of any issues surrounding the ir preceptor or rotation. The APPE Director, IPPE Director and/or Director of Experiential Outreach and Assessment , or the School, will then follow up with preceptors and students on any identified problem areas. Preceptors are required to complete one el ectronic evaluation at the mid -point and one electronic evaluation at the end of each student rotation. Preceptors are asked to immediately notify Teri Undem, APPE Director (701 -231-6578) or Rebecca Brynjulson, IPPE Director (701 -231-7477) of any problems with their students or the rotation Academic Honesty Statement All work in this course must be completed in a manner consistent with NDSU University Senate Policy, Section 335: Code of Academic Responsibility and Conduct . Violating this code will result in a penalty or penalties to be determined by the instructor depending on the seriousness and circumstances of the offense. The instructor may: (1) fail the student for the particular assignment or test; or (2) give the student a failing grade. Students are responsible for doing and submitting the ir own work. Such actions may include dismissal, which is a suspension from NDSU f or a specific period of time, or expulsion from NDSU, which carries no expectation of return at a later date. Academic dishonesty, in any form, is inconsistent with an academic community that operates on the basis of honesty, integrity, and fair play. If q uestions arise, students are encouraged to consult with the instructor. Academic and Professional Misconduct For further information on Academic or Professional Misconduct please see Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy 3.01 in the Pharmacy Student Handbook . Preceptors are asked to immediately notify Teri Undem, APPE Director (701 -231-6578) or Rebecca Brynjulson, IPPE Director (701 -231-7477) of any problems with their students on the rotation. PRECEPTOR RESPONSIBILITIES The integration of classroom knowledge into professional performance is recognized as an essential activity in the achievement of professionalism. The following list emphasizes the serious responsibilities inherent in accepting the role of a preceptor: a. Understand the dimensions, responsibilities and tasks of pharmacy practice and identify those tasks which are performed in the preceptor's pharmacy. b. Assess the student 's knowledge and level of experience before assigning learning experiences. From both educational and public safety standpoints, the student's duties should not exceed his/her educational level. c. Review the assessment of the student's entry level knowledge and experience with the student, pointing out strengths and weaknesses and assigning learning experiences to correct deficiencies. d. Set clear learning objectives for the student, based on the student's education and experience and upon the dimensions, resp onsibilities and tasks of pharmacy practice. e. Plan specific learning activities that will contribute to the mastery of each task and ensure time to practice the skill in the pharmacy. f. Thoroughly review such topics as patient confidentiality, security practices, professional demeanor, patient communication, communication with other health professionals, work schedules, lines of responsibility, relationships with the preceptor and other staff members, employee benefits, professional supervision, and the performance evaluation. g. Provide information and demonstrate appropriate practice performance. h. Serve as a learning resource and role model for the student while infusing new values and attitudes. i. Provide a broad scope of educational experiences. Special projects may be arranged, such as in -service training, design of record systems, and newsletter writing. Exchange visits to other pharmacies may provide exposure to alternative distribution, recordkeeping and control systems. j. Systematically rotate the student's responsibilities to provide a wide variety of experiences. k. Coordinate and share teaching and supervisory responsibilities with other pharmacists. l. Close and continuous supervision of the student's performance, appropriate for his/her educational level and experience, is required by all preceptors. However, the advanced student's learning is facilitated when some latitude in independent performance is permitted. Intermittent checks of performance and retrospective reviews may be appropriate for th e advanced student who has acquired the judgment making ability required for practice. m. Provide positive corrective feedback during the learning process. Discuss pharmaceutical care plans and SOAP notes and answer any questions or refer to literature for evidence based practices. n. Evaluate and document the student's abilities during and at the completion of the Pharmacy Practice Experience. These evaluations may take the form of exit interviews, performance rating scales, review of student reports/care plans, and performance tests. o. Meet with representatives of the Board of Pharmacy or of the School of Pharmacy who are responsible for coordinating the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience Program. p. Encourage/model active participation in continuing educat ion and lifelong learning.

KEY STEPS IN LEARNING The learning activities suggested for students can be summarized in five steps. Set Clear Learning Objectives Determine the Achievement Level and Learning Needs of the Student Plan Specific Learning Activities Implement the Learning Plan Evaluate and Feedback the Results Set Clear Learning Objectives Preceptors are responsible for supervising the learning of students who will practice in general practice locations and in various roles. The preceptor and the student should begin each rotation with a prepared set of learning objectives that represent a description of the knowledge, skills, and capabilities required to practice pharmacy in that setting. It is important that the student be exposed to the differen t roles and tasks. This may require arrangement of learning experiences outside of the preceptor's pharmacy Determine the Achievement Level and Learning Needs of the Student Specifically ask the student what he/she knows, what they have experience d, and their expectations during the rotation you are supervising. Decide what knowledge, skills, and attitudes are deficient in the student's background and focus the learning on these deficiencies. Plan Specific Learning Activities Decide on the experiences/learning activities that will be necessary to meet the learning objectives of both the student and the preceptor. Learning activities may include daily practice responsibilities, observation of selected tasks, working on assignments and special projects, reading journal articles or other references, attending meetings and seminars, discussions with the preceptor and other pharmacists, and evaluation of performance. Implement the Learning Plan Develop a schedule of experiences/learning activities that are possible within your rotation site and during the rotation time frame. Arrange for special visits to other practice sites or with ot her health professionals. Determine the best time for the preceptor to meet with the student to offer ad vice and feedback. Evaluate and Feedback the Results If possible, it is important to provide feedback when the behavior is observed. Provide corrective and supportive feedback as often as possible focusing on specific assignments or tasks performed. THE IMPORTANCE OF FEEDBACK The student needs to know whether he/she is performing appropriately. Approval by the preceptor and appreciation from patients and other health professionals are factors which will encourage the student to repeat proper performance. An awareness of satisfactory performance is as important as an awareness of deficiencies because a student needs to understand how to improve on a parti cular skill so that he/she can increase proficiency through practice in a future rotation. In addition to feedback from the preceptor regarding performance, the preceptor should discuss/quiz the student regularly on assigned tasks. Correct responses contribute to positive reinforcement. Incorrect answers are not necessarily a sign of failure, but a signal to re -emphasize a particular task. Suggested Questions to initiate conversation and begin feedback for the Mid- rotation and/or Final Rotation Evaluations: 1. How would you rate your performance so far? How do you think your care plans are going? 2. What do you think of your .......? .... patient counseling? .... time management skills? 3. Why do you think that? Explain what you feel you are doing well ... or not so well? 4. How could you improve? 5. What would you like to improve in the coming weeks? 6. Set specific objectives for the student or incorporate in objective setting along with the student. 7. Do you have enough time to work on projects/tasks here? Too much time? 8. What is your favorite activity for this rotation...of the day? 9. What is your least favorite activity? Why? 10. What is the most important task you are assigned? 11. What did you find helpful in learning/preparing for this rotation? 12. What would you like to see change in the future? 13. What would you say are the strengths and weaknesses of this rotation? 14. What skills have you learned that you plan to use in the future Seven Keys to Effective Feedback Feedback should be: Goal- Referenced Tangible and Transparent Actionable User -friendly Timely Ongoing Consistent Portions of this manual have been extracted from the AACP/NABP manual, The Internship Experience , the Drake University Competency Statements developed with the support of SmithKline Corporation, the Community Practice Externship Manual of the University Of Minnesota College Of Pharmacy and Wiggins G.

It's being able to differentiate between what you do know and what you don't.1 -Anatole France (1844 -1924) Every person enters pharmacy school with different experiences; however, by the end of your pharmacy education, you will have all received a set of similar pharmacy experiences which will make you a well -rounded pharmacist. The focus of this introductory rotation is to familiarize students with the technical aspects of medication distribution within an institutional pharmacy practice setting. Advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) rotations during the fourth year of pharmacy school will build upon the knowledge base gained during the introductory experiences and will allow students to focus primarily on the advanced pharmacist roles involved in the oversight of medication distribution within an institutional pharmacy practice environment. First year students have a skill set that is most comparable to technicians in an institutional pharmacy practice setting, whereas fourth year students have a skill set that is most comparable to entry level pharmacists in an institutional pharmacy practice setting. First year students should seek to learn and understand the delivery of medications and pharmacy services within an institutional setting and to develop the technical skills required to practice in an institutional pharmacy practice setting on a regular basis so that they can learn to provide appropriate oversight as a pharmacist in this setting. Additionally, first year students should also seek to apply knowledge and practice skills learned during their first yea r curriculum. Students who have previously had experience in this type of practice setting also have the ability to consider his/her previous experiences and identify areas of advanced learning and/or personal growth in a new environment. Students will d evelop three individualized learning objectives in addition to the activities outlined above as one of the assignments due before the practice experience begins. Objectives should be realistic taking into account your pharmacy education and previous work experience. They must also be measurable (e.g. the student will need to know when and how these objectives have been met during the practice experience). This will help students and preceptors to customize introductory experiences. Students are expected to discuss individualized learning objectives and expectations with the preceptor during the first week of the rotation.

For further inf ormation about blood or body fluid exposure, visit the CDC website at: http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/emergnedl.html Leave of Absence Policy a. Students requiring a leave of absence from the experiential education curriculum for any reason may have a delayed graduation. i. Preference for high demand rotations is not provided to students with children. This preferential placement would be discriminating against students without children. 20 | P a g e 1. Stud ents with children are encouraged to identify childcare options early in their professional studies, both within the Fargo Moorhead area as well at outside the Fargo Moorhead area (e.g. places where support structures, such as family members, may be availa ble to assist with childcare). 2. Students with children are encouraged to rank rotation sites in the Fargo Moorhead area within their preferences and to choose sites outside the Fargo Moorhead area that are either in areas with student -identified support structures and/or are within driving distance of the Fargo Moorhead area. ii. If a student, is expecting a child and will be in her last trimester during the time of IPPE and wants to complete her IPPE rotation, she can submit a physician note indicating the med ical necessity of placement at a rotation site close to her healthcare provider in order to facilitate ease with physician visits. Accommodations will be considered for those rotations taking place within 6 weeks of delivery. A student whose partner is expecting a child may request the same accommodations. iii. As an alternative accommodation for IPPE, students expecting a child during IPPE rotations may choose to delay their IPPE until the following summer without delaying progression within the program. PHRM 3 55 and PHRM 455 must be completed prior to the beginning of APPE rotations. iv. Students are responsible for disclosing pregnancy to preceptors prior to rotations for the safety of the student and the child. v. APPE students may request accommodations for site pl acement based upon the same factors outlined above for IPPE rotations. vi. An APPE student expecting a child during rotations may have a delayed graduation date. 1. Based upon the Experiential Education absence policy and the required preceptor signature certifyi ng 200 completed hours per rotation, a student expecting a child during a rotation will receive an incomplete grade with the expectation that the missed rotation hours will be rescheduled at the end of the rotation year, resulting in a delayed graduation. vii. Students who adopt or receive a child in foster care, may choose to reschedule their rotation. The student will receive an incomplete grade with the expectation that the missed rotation hours will be made up at the end of the rotation year, resulting in a delayed graduation. viii.

It's being able to differentiate between what you do know and what you don't.1 -Anatole France (1844 -1924) Every person enters pharmacy school with different experiences; however, by the end of your pharmacy educati on, you will have all received a set of similar pharmacy experiences which will make you a well -rounded pharmacist. The focus of this introductory rotation is to familiarize students with the technical aspects of medication distrib ution within a community pharmacy practice setting. Advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) rotations during the fourth year of pharmacy school will build upon the knowledge base gained during the introductory experiences and will allow students to focus primarily on the ad vanced p harmacist roles involved in dispensing medications and providing patient care services within a community pharmacy practice environment. Second year students have a skill set that is most comparable to technicians in a community pharmacy practice s etting, whereas fourth year students have a skill set that is most comparable to entry level pharmacists in a community pharmacy practice setting. Second year students should seek to learn and understand the delivery of medications and pharmacy services w ithin a community setting and to develop the technical skills required to practice in community practice setting on a regular basis so that they can learn to provide appropriate oversight as a pharmacist in this setting. Additionally, second year students should also seek to apply knowledge and practice skills learned during their second year curriculum including consultation and OTC recommendations. Students who have previously had experience in this type of practice setting also have the ability to consi der his/her previous experiences and identify areas of advanced learning and/or personal growth in a new environment. Students will develop three individualized learning objectives in addition to the activities outlined above as one of the assignments due before the practice experience begins. Objectives should be realistic taking into account your pharmacy education and previous work experience. They must also be measurable (e.g. the student will need to know when and how these objectives have been met d uring the practice experience). This will help students and preceptors to customize introductory experiences. Students are expected to discuss individualized learning objectives and expectations with the preceptor during the first week of the rotation. Reference: 1. http://www.quotationspage.com/subjects/education/, accessed 2009. 16 | P a g e COURSE ASSIGNMENTS Assignments Due Before Practice Experiences Begin IPPE Individualized Learning Objectives Small Group Discussion Due: In Blackboard, May 1 3, 201 9 at 4:00 p.m. Due: In Blackboard, May 1 7, 201 9 at 4:00 p.m. This discussion will be completed online in Blackboard among the student's assigned small group. Each student in the group should start a thread with at least three individualized learning objectives that he/she has for his/her community IPPE. Individualized learning objectives must be posted by May 13, 2019 at 4:00 p.m. Each student should read the individualized learning objectives for each of the other members of the group and must post at least one comment on the learning objectives of each group member providing constructive feedback to group members on ways to improv e learning objectives by May 17, 201 9 at 4:00 p.m. Students should discuss these goals/objectives with their preceptor within the first week of their rotation and plan for completion of their goals throughout their practice experience. Assignments Due Du ring Practice Experiences Rotation One: May 24, 2019 at 11:59 p.m. Rotation Two: June 21, 2019 at 11:59 p.m. Taking into account the comments received from members in the online small group discussion and input from the preceptor/site during week one , the student should post his/her finalized learning objectives into Learning Modules/Coursework in E*Value by May 24, 2019 at 11:59 p.m. (Rotation One) OR June 21, 2019 at 11:59 p.m. (Rotation Two). The p receptor will verify that this was completed in the electronic preceptor evaluation of the student. Drug Information Request Assignment Due: IPPE Week Four Rotation One: June 14, 2019 at 11:59 p.m. Rotation Two: July 12, 2019 at 11:59 p.m. This assignment may be completed at any time throughout the four week rotation. Pharmacists are routinely asked to provide drug information to healthcare providers. Responses to information requests from healthcare providers should be clear, succinct, and accurate taking into account primary, secondary and tertiary literature. Stude nts should work with their preceptor to identify at least one drug information request from a healthcare provider to respond to during their experience. The drug information request response should be \u00bd page typed, single spaced, excluding references. References should be documented using biomedical style/Chicago style (as used in PHRM 480: Drug Literature Evaluation). A copy of the student's completed drug information request must be provided to and discussed with their preceptor. Preceptors will evaluate the quality of the student's drug information responses in the final evaluation using the following evaluation question: 17 | P a g e Retrieve and analyze scientific literature to answer a drug information request. The Drug Information Request Assignment will be uploaded E*Value under Learning Modules/ Coursework. Current Event Topic Due: IPPE Week Four Rotation One: June 14, 2019 at 11:59 p.m. Rotation Two: July 12, 2019 at 11:59 p.m. This assignment should be completed by the end of the fourth week and reviewed with preceptor. Pharmacists are commonly asked about recent medication or health related topics that have been discussed in the news or written about in newspapers, magazines, etc. It is important for pharmacists to be knowledgeable about current events relating to healthcare. This knowledge and ability to discuss current events with patients helps to build and maintain the trust and confidence patients have in their pharmacist. In this assignment, students will n eed to research on their own a current event related to pharmacy practice recently talked about in the media. The student should state the nature of the current event, source it is taken from, and discuss the impac t of this topic in patient care and/or co mmunity pharmacy practice. The student will be expected to discuss his/her findings with their preceptor. The preceptor does not evaluate the student performance of this activity. The student will reflect on what he/she learned in the reflection graded by faculty at the college. Case Logs Due: IPPE Week One, Two, Three and Four This assignment should be completed each week and your progress should be reviewed with your preceptor weekly by providing your preceptor with a weekly case log report to view. At the end of the rotation, your preceptor will respond to an evaluation question inquiring if this process was completed . Each week the report should begin from the start date of your rotation so that you can see your progress from week to week. The last report for week four should be from the first day of your rotation until the last day of your rotation. The following assignments will be logged using case logs in aggregate over the four weeks: 4 patient interviews, 40 prescription consultations, 10 non-prescription consultations, and four interprofessional healthcare provider interactions.

Based upon the Experiential Education absence policy and the required preceptor signature cert ifying 200 completed hours per rotation, a student expecting a child during a rotation will receive an incomplete grade with the expectation that the missed rotation hours will be rescheduled at the end of the rotation year, resulting in a delayed graduati on. vii. Students who adopt or receive a child in foster care, may choose to reschedule their rotation. The student will receive an incomplete grade with the expectation that the missed rotation hours will be made up at the end of the rotation year, resulting i n a delayed graduation. viii. Students who are unable to perform the essential function of a rotation based on elder care responsibilities, care for spouses and/or children with medical issues, or the need to care for themselves as a result of medical issues may need to take time away from rotations. Missed rotation hours will be made up as deemed appropriate by the student and the appropriate Experiential Education Director. Time away from rotations may result in a delayed graduation. ix. Students who are lactating while on rotation will be encouraged to contact the specific rotation site's department of human resources to help identify an available lactation room. XV.

Other remediation plans will be determ ined by the Director of IPPE and the student. 36 | P a g e Preceptor Evaluation of Student Resulting in Rotation Remediation or Failure A. During any IPPE, if a student puts patients, preceptors or the practice at risk, that student may be immediately dismissed from the rotation and given a failing grade for that rotation. Students will not receive credit for failed rotation hours. B. Upon failure of an IPPE rotation, a student will receive a failing grade and the student will complete a remediation plan during the subs equent academic year that includes repeating the course for academic credit. The student will be required to successfully complete all IPPE hours prior to beginning APPE. A minimum of 300 IPPE hours must be successfully completed prior to APPE. C. If a stude nt requires remediation and does not successfully complete the remediation plan, College Policy 3.03, Right to Terminate Enrollment, will be considered.

Performance will be mo nitored as described in Current Sites and Preceptors section. Ongoing preceptor development is offered to all preceptors in multiple formats (live, recorded, webinar, and newsletter). Preceptors are considered Adjunct Faculty with the NDSU School of Pharmacy and are not eligible for promotion. Current Sites and Preceptors The Director or their designate will evaluate all experien tial sites taking five or more students per year in person at least once every two years. Sites taking less than five stu dents per year, and those not within driving distance may be evaluated via site visits, email or telephone conversations every three years . Sites may be evaluated more frequently if needed (e.g., poor student evaluations, change in preceptor at the site). This routine evaluation is to determine continued approval for completion of student pharmacist experiential education at the practice site. The Director of Experiential Outreach and Assessment or their designate will evaluate the site and preceptor according to established criteria (see the attached Experiential Site and Preceptor Evaluation form). During the site visit, the student evaluations of the site and preceptor will be discussed. Roles and responsibilities of both the preceptor and the inst itution will be reviewed. The preceptor will be commended for areas in which the preceptor and/or site are meeting or exceeding expectations. Constructive feedback that addresses specific areas that need improvement will also be discussed with the precepto r. Working with the Director or their designate, the preceptor will develop an improvement plan, if necessary. Preceptor feedback regarding the School's experiential program will be solicited during the evaluation discussion. A copy of the experiential site and preceptor evaluation form and student evaluations will be kept electronically in the electronic rotation management system for retrieval and review. Experiential sites and/or preceptors not granted approval, or those gr anted conditional approval and not meeting those conditions will not be used/retained as a preceptor and/or training site for the program. School of Pharmacy Assessment Committee and Experiential Education Committee: The School of Pharmacy Assessment Com mittee will provide oversight for the assessment of student learning and the Experiential Education Committee will provide oversight of the QA process for the experiential program.

Didactic/Lab Curriculum Co-curriculum Experiential Curriculum AACP 12:31 NDSU SCHOOL OF PHARMACY CO-CURRICULUM PROGRAM PLAN 2019-2020 Standard Students in the professional PharmD program shall fulfill all co-curricular requirements within the specified time frame. Rationale Learning alongside the formal curriculum allows for exposure and collaboration with other disciplines and is essential to develop the knowledge, skills, and abilities, behaviors, and attitudes necessary to be a team- ready and practice-ready pharmacist. Description \"Co-curricular activities complement, augment, and/or advance learning that occurs within the formal professional didactic and experiential curriculum\" (ACPE Standards 2016, Guidance 4b). The co-curriculum consists of experiences mapping to program level Ability-Based Outcomes and ACPE Standards 3, 4, and 12. Organized by professional year and a particular area of focus, the co-curriculum includes required experiences as well as elective opportunities, which students may choose from based upon their interests, experience, and professional goals. Co-curricular requirements may vary year-to-year depending upon availability and curriculum changes. Students will be informed of co-curricular requirements and deadlines at the beginning of each academic year. 1. Students must fulfill all co-curricular requirements to be in good academic and professional standing. Students who fail to comply with all co-curricular requirements by the due date will be reported to the School of Pharmacy Senior Associate Dean (who shall serve as the Co-Curriculum Director) and receive a Professionalism Infraction. Students are allowed a one week grace-period after the due date to satisfy all co-curricular requirements. Failure to comply with all co-curricular requirements after the one week grace-period will be treated as a \"course failure\". 2.Required co-curricular experiences (Table 1) align with curricular content taught in that professional year and focus on essential knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors, and attitudes necessary to be a self- aware, team-ready, and practice-ready pharmacist. 3.Elective co-curricular experiences (Table 2) consist of a menu of opportunities that students may choose from based upon their interests, experience, and professional goals. a. Students are encouraged to select elective activities that will enhance their development as a pharmacist and growth in a particular area. Faculty advisors can assist students in making selections. b. Although a co-curricular activity may map to more than one ACPE Standard and Ability-Based Outcome, it may only be used once to fulfill program requirements.c. Not all elective activities will be available each semester or year depending upon the sponsoring agency or organization.APPENDIX 12C12/6/2019 12:31 PM 2 d. Students wishing to add a co-curricular activity to the menu of electives should contact the Co- Curriculum Director PRIOR to the activity to discuss justification for inclusion. The student will work with the Director to devise learning outcomes for the activity to ensure it meets the definition for co-curriculum and can be adequately assessed. Requests must be approved PRIOR to the student's completion of the co-curricular activity, which may take up to 4 weeks. Therefore, students are encouraged to plan ahead. Student Process 1. Credit for all co-curricular experiences is given provided the student fulfills the activity in its entirety and uploads the required artifact to their Blackboard e-Portfolio by the specified due date. 2. If the experience is an elective, complete the 'Co-Curricular Elective Experience Tracking Form (Appendix A) as soon as possible after the experience and upload it into their personal Blackboard e- Portfolio. 3. Conduct an end of semester self-assessment of learning related to the co-curriculum focus area using the guided reflection prompts: a. What was/were your learning objectives for the co-curriculum focus area at the beginning of the semester? b. In what ways has your knowledge or skills in this focus area been advanced this semester or year from the co-curriculum experiences? c. How might your involvement in these co-curricular experiences prepare you for future practice? d. What learning is still necessary for you to achieve your learning objectives in this focus area? e. Based upon your self-assessment, identify at least one learning objective pertaining to this co- curricular focus area that you will continue to work on and a plan to further develop that area. 4. Write a reflection from #3 above, making sure to include all guided reflection prompts (a. - e.) and upload it to your e-Portfolio by the due date. Reflections and fulfillment of Co-Curricular requirements will be assessed using the Reflection Paper and e-Portfolio Grading Rubric (Appendix B-D). 5. Complete all requirements in your Co-Curriculum e-Portfolio, upload it to Blackboard, and share it with your advisor by the due date. 6. Arrange a time to meet with your faculty advisor prior to the end of the semester to discuss your professional growth. 7. Students who are out of sequence or graduating later than originally intended will be informed of co- curricular expectations by the Co-Curriculum Director. Faculty Advisor Role 1. The primary role of the faculty advisor is to help foster career and professional development. 2. Examine each advisee's professional growth each semester via their reflection paper and e-Portfolio artifacts. 12/6/2019 12:31 PM 3 3. Grade reflection paper and e-Portfolio assignments in ExamSoft using rubric provided (Appendix B-D) and push grades to student. 4. Meet with advisees either individually or as a group before the conclusion of the semester to discuss their professional growth, professional goals, and assist with curricular and co-curricular planning. 5. Notify the Co-Curriculum Director of students who fail to comply with all co-curricular requirements by the initial and grace-period due dates. 12/6/2019 12:31 PM 4 Table 1.
