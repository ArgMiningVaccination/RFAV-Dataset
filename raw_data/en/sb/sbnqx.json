LOUIS, Mo. \u2014 Missouri is now in Phase 1B, Tier 2 of its COVID-19 vaccine rollout. This phase includes people ages 65 and over and adults with certain health conditions that put them at high risk for the virus. But one chiropractic physician in the previous phase, Phase 1A, tells 41 Action News she still hasn't been able to receive her first dose of the vaccine. Dr. Rebecca Gould is a private chiropractor in St. Louis. She has been eligible to receive the vaccine since December but hasn't been able to yet. Gould registered with the St. Louis County Health Department as soon as she could but said she hasn't heard back yet. \"I would just like to be contacted even if it's just to say we're not sure exactly when, but this is an estimate,\" Gould said. She also filled out a registry for people like her in Phase 1A and signed up through several hospitals. \"I've put my name in the hat in a lot of places, and I just haven't received any hint of what to do,\" Gould said. Earlier this week, Missouri activated Phase 1B, Tier 2 of the distribution. Now, Gould fears she'll fall even further behind in line. \"I feel like if there are available appointments, they're now going to be flooded with people who should also be vaccinated but maybe aren't in a high-risk situation as I am,\" Gould said. 41 Action News reached out to the St. Louis County Health Department. A spokesperson said the county has received about 4,900 doses of vaccine and has 225,000 people registered, many of whom are in Phase 1A. \"It will take time to get to everyone,\" the spokesperson said. Gould said it's a frustrating wait when she's still actively seeing patients. \"I'm willing to drive. I know it says the vaccine should be free, I'm willing to pay,\" Gould said. \"I want to do the right thing for my patients and my family.\" A spokesperson for the Kansas City, Missouri, Health Department said anyone in a similar position [can fill out the survey on the health department's website](https://hipaa.jotform.com/210117358088152).
