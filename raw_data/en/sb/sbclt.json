ESTIMATES AND COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS For fiscal year 2018, the Committee recommends total budget au- thority of $969,052,391,000 for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies. This amount includes $164,066,000,000 in current year discretionary funding subject to discretionary spending caps and $1,896,000,000 in cap adjustments for healthcare fraud and abuse control and for program integrity at the Social Security Administration, in accord-ance with the allocation for this bill. Fiscal year 2017 levels cited in this report reflect the enacted amounts in Public Law 115-31, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, adjusted for comparability where noted. OVERVIEW The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Re- lated Agencies [Labor-HHS-Education] appropriations bill con-stitutes the largest share of non-defense discretionary spending, 32 percent of the total in fiscal year 2018. Total spending in this bill subject to discretionary spending caps is $3,041,000,000 above the comparable fiscal year 2017 level. In addition, the bill includes $4,393,000,000 in spending offset by savings from changes in man-datory programs, $3,831,900,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 level. This decreased funding level has required the Committee to make difficult funding decisions and consider the appropriate role and jurisdiction of Federal programs. The priorities and consider-ations of the Committee in developing this bill are summarized in the section below: NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH The Committee recommendation includes $36,084,000,000 for the NIH, an increase of $2,000,000,000. Even in a difficult funding en-vironment, the Committee believes it is critical to prioritize funding for NIH and build on the last 2 years of funding increases in a pre-dictable and consistent way. Without continued investment in the NIH, we jeopardize our current scientific progress, risk losing a generation of scientists, and stunt our Nation's global competitive-ness. The Committee rejects the Administration's proposal to cap Fa- cilities & Administrative [F&A] costs for NIH grantees at 10 per-cent. While the Committee understands the desire to identify budg-et and administrative savings, F&A costs are not optional; they are a fundamental part of doing research. The Committee also dis- agrees with the proposal to eliminate the John E. Fogarty Inter-national Center and provides funding to maintain the Center at NIH. Disease knows no borders. It is critical to ensure that NIH continues to have the resources to build scientific expertise in de-9 veloping countries and, as we saw with the Zika virus, continue its strong partnerships internationally to protect the health and safety of Americans. Finally, the Committee recommendation allocates funding to areas holding the most promise of scientific advancement, while al-lowing NIH to maintain flexibility to pursue unplanned scientific opportunities and address unforeseen public health needs. The Committee recommendation is estimated to support over 10,600 new and competing grants in fiscal year 2018. Alzheimer's Disease .\u2014In 2017, Medicare and Medicaid will spend an estimated $175,000,000,000 caring for those with Alzheimer's and other dementias, 68 percent of total costs. It is the most expen-sive disease in America. Without a medical breakthrough to pre-vent, slow, or stop the disease, by 2050 the combined Medicare and Medicaid spending on people with Alzheimer's disease will more than quadruple. The Committee recommendation includes an in-crease of $414,000,000 for Alzheimer's disease research, bringing the total available in fiscal year 2018 to approximately $1,828,000,000, a 29.3 percent increase above fiscal year 2017. Over the last three years, specific funding for Alzheimer's disease research has increased $1,239,000,000, a 210 percent increase. Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies [BRAIN] .\u2014The Committee continues to strongly support the BRAIN Initiative and provides $400,000,000 in fiscal year 2018. This is an increase of $140,000,000 above fiscal year 2017. The BRAIN Initiative is developing a more complete understanding of brain function and has the possibility of helping millions of people who suffer from a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric dis-orders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's dis-ease and dementia, depression, and traumatic brain injury. Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria [CARB] .\u2014The Com- mittee supports efforts to develop new antibiotics and rapid diag-nostic tests. Given the threat posed by the spread of antibiotic re-sistant bacteria, the recommendation includes $513,000,000, an in-crease of $50,000,000 above fiscal year 2017. Precision Medicine .\u2014The Committee provides $370,000,000, an increase of $70,000,000 above fiscal year 2017, for the Precision Medicine Initiative. This includes $80,000,000 for the National Cancer Institute's precision medicine initiative that applies ad-vances in cancer genomics and precision oncology to allow physi-cians to individualize cancer treatments to a patient. In addition, $290,000,000 is provided for the All of Us study. COMBATING OPIOID ABUSE Nearly 2 million American adults have an opioid use disorder re- lated to prescription pain relievers, and almost 600,000 have an opioid use disorder related to heroin. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], the amount of opioids pre-scribed per person was three times higher in 2015 than in 1999, and drug overdose deaths have nearly tripled in the last 15 years. Even more troubling, prescription opioid abuse is a risk factor for heroin use, another form of opioids. Approximately 3 out of 4 new heroin users abused prescription opioids before switching to heroin. To stop the spread of further opioid abuse, the bill provides 10 $816,210,000, an increase of $665,000,000, or 440 percent, since fis- cal year 2016, in discretionary funding to fight both prescription opioid and heroin abuse: State Targeted Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis Grants .\u2014The Committee continues to provide $500,000,000 for State responses to opioid abuse, for a total of $1,000,000,000 in the past two fiscal years. The Committee strongly encourages the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA] not to change requirements that would require States and Territories to reapply for the second year of State grant funding. By doing so, States could reduce administrative burdens and the Department could focus on promoting effective implementation of the already ap-proved plans. The Department is directed to brief the Committee on any planned changes for fiscal year 2018 at least 30 days prior to any public announcement of such changes. Further, the Depart-ment is directed to brief the Committee quarterly on implementa-tion of the program, including detailing obligation of such funding. Community Health Centers .\u2014The Committee continues $50,000,000 from the prior year for grants to expand services for the treatment, prevention, and awareness of opioid abuse. This funding will help health centers support 220,000 patients with ac-cessing substance abuse services. Opioid Prevention Grant .\u2014The Committee includes a new $15,000,000 opioid prevention grant targeted to communities and community coalitions. The Committee directs SAMHSA to develop and distribute evidence-based practices to prevent opioid abuse. In total, the Department is expected to spend $910,210,000 in discretionary and mandatory funding for targeted efforts to combat opioid abuse in fiscal year 2018. In addition, States have access to the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant, fund-ed at $1,858,079,000 in fiscal year 2018. Finally, the National In-stitute on Drug Abuse [NIDA] continues its efforts to understand addiction, fund research on medications to alleviate pain, support efforts to better understand the long-term effects of prescription opioid use, and research alternative ways to treat pain. NIDA re-ceives an increase of $1,113,442,000 in this act. PROMOTING COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND COMPLETION The Committee recommendation includes a 1.7 percent increase in the maximum Pell grant, from a total maximum award of $5,920 in the 2017-18 academic year, to $6,020 for the 2018-19 academic year. This represents the first discretionary increase in the max-imum Pell grant award in over a decade. The maximum Pell grant has increased each year since the 2007-08 award year, and auto-matically each year since 2013-14 based on increases in the Con-sumer Price Index, paid for with mandatory funding. The auto-matic increase in the ''mandatory add-on'' expires this year and the Committee recommendation ensures the maximum Pell grant will continue to increase for the 2018-19 award year, helping students keep up with rising costs and reducing the need for student loans. In addition, the Committee recommendation includes more than sufficient funding to continue Year-Round Pell, a permanent law change included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The 11 2018-19 academic year will be the first full year of implementation of Year-Round Pell, which will allow students who have exhausted their traditional Pell grant award for a given academic year, to re-ceive an additional Pell grant if they enroll in coursework for an additional term during the same academic year, traditionally the summer. This is expected to provide over 900,000 students an addi-tional award of over $1,600 for the 2018-19 school year, which will help them complete their program faster, enter or re-enter the workforce sooner, and graduate with less debt. The Committee recommendation also includes new bill language restoring the eligibility period for Pell grants for those students de-frauded by institutions of higher education and report language di-recting the Secretary to take additional actions to provide relief from fraudulently issued Federal loan debt, including by contacting potentially eligible borrowers. IMPROVING FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY The Committee has an obligation to promote fiscal accountability and the effective use of U.S. taxpayer funds. The annual appropria-tions process affords Congress the opportunity to continuously im-prove and refine how Government works. Appropriations bills pro-vide oversight of every discretionary program, every year, which gives these bills the unique ability to react to changing needs and unintended consequences in the intervening years of an authoriza-tion bill. Taxpayer Transparency .\u2014U.S. taxpayers have a right to know how the Federal Government is spending their hard-earned tax-payer dollars\u2014especially when that money is being spent on adver-tising Federal programs. The Committee recommendation con-tinues a provision to promote Government transparency and ac-countability by requiring Federal agencies funded in this act to in- clude disclaimers when advertising materials are paid for with Federal funds. The Committee expects each agency to include in their fiscal year 2019 CJ information detailing how much funding was spent on advertising in fiscal year 2018. Federal Vehicle Fleet Management .\u2014The General Services Ad- ministration [GSA] issues guidance on Federal fleet management, but the Federal vehicle fleet is decentralized, with each agency maintaining flexibility to manage vehicle utilization as appropriate. To provide greater transparency and accountability of funding for Federal vehicles, the Committee directs agencies funded in this bill to conduct an annual review of fleet utilization during the third quarter of each fiscal year. Agencies are directed to provide their Offices of Inspectors General [OIGs] with supporting documenta-tion on the method used for determining optimal fleet inventories and justification for any deviation from GSA's Federal Property Management Regulations. OIGs shall be responsible for conducting annual audits of fleet management practices and making the sub-sequent results publicly available. Public Health Services Act [PHS] Evaluation Transfer .\u2014The Committee recommendation continues to ensure that in fiscal year 2018, no funds will leave NIH via the transfer required by section 241 of the PHS Act. 12 INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNMENT The Committee provides funding for a variety of activities aimed at reducing fraud, waste, and abuse of taxpayer dollars. These pro-gram integrity initiatives have proven to be a wise Federal invest-ment, resulting in billions of dollars of savings each year. In addi-tion, the Committee recommendation provides direction to the De-partments on opportunities to take action where Federal programs are fragmented or duplicative. The bill advocates that longstanding priority by reforming and transforming government in many small ways, and several initiatives to increase the efficiency and cost ef-fectiveness of Government, including: Fighting Healthcare Fraud and Abuse .\u2014The Committee includes $745,000,000 for the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control pro-gram at CMS. The Committee notes that the latest data dem-onstrates for every new $1 spent on fraud and abuse, $2 is recov-ered by the U.S. Treasury. Inspectors General .\u2014The Committee recommendation provides $350,477,000 for the Inspectors General funded in this act to con-duct additional audits and investigations of possible waste and fraud in Government programs. The Committee appreciates the strong working relationships between the Inspectors General and the agencies they work with under this Committee's jurisdiction. The Committee reiterates the strong expectation that Inspectors General have timely and independent access to all records, reports, audits, reviews, documents, papers, recommendations, data and data systems, or other materials related to their responsibilities under this act and under the Inspector General Act of 1978. Fur-ther, the Committee also expects that all agencies funded by this act treat electronic data, records, and systems no differently than paper-based records and files with respect to access by OIGs unless particular electronic systems are clearly and explicitly protected from Inspectors General access by statute. Preventing Improper Social Security Payments .\u2014The Committee recommendation includes $1,735,000,000 for the Social Security Administration [SSA] to conduct continuing disability reviews and SSI program redeterminations of non-medical eligibility and for other program integrity efforts. Combined, these activities are esti-mated to save approximately $9,828,000,000 over 10 years in tax-payer dollars by reducing waste, fraud, abuse, and improper pay-ments in the Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs. Taxpayer Accountability .\u2014In recent years, GAO has published reports showing as many as 249 areas of potential duplication and overlap. Since 2011, GAO has identified 724 actions to reduce, eliminate, or better manage fragmentation, overlap, or duplication; achieve costs savings; or enhance revenue. While GAO has noted that the Nation has achieved $136,000,000,000 in savings based on these reports, many more efficiencies may be realized. The Com-mittee directs each agency funded in this bill to report to the Com-mittee, within 1 year of enactment of this act, on all efforts made to address the duplication identified by the annual GAO reports along with identifying substantive challenges and legal barriers to implementing GAO's recommendations, as well as suggested legis-13 lative recommendations that could help the agency to further re- duce duplication. Given the current fiscal environment, it is imper-ative for Government agencies to increase efficiencies to maximize the effectiveness of agency programs. Tribal Coordination .\u2014The Committee directs all Departments with American Indian and Alaskan Native specific programs or grants to coordinate with the Department of the Interior when pos-sible to ensure there is no overlap or duplication of funding or serv-ices and to enhance the programs' effectiveness. Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund Integrity .\u2014The Committee provides $130,000,000 for Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments [RESEA] for fiscal year 2018. The RESEA program provides for intensive, in-person attention from specialists in the One-Stop career center system for individuals most likely to ex-haust unemployment compensation benefits, those with particular barriers to reemployment, and others who have been difficult to place. RESEA has significantly reduced the time participating indi-viduals must rely on unemployment compensation payments and reduced the total amount of benefits paid from the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. The program has also shown the benefit of reducing improper payments to ineligible claimants, thus helping protect the fiscal solvency of the trust fund. GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS The Committee continues to note that executive branch agencies may, as authorized by the Administrative Procedures Act, issue a variety of types of interpretive guidance documents that are ex-empt from the public notice and comment process. However, some have raised concerns under the last Administration about the use of guidance documents because, while such documents are not le-gally binding, regulated entities may interpret them as imposing new legally binding requirements. Further, the GAO has found that executive branch agencies could improve procedures for ap-proving, disseminating, and periodically reviewing guidance docu-ments. For example, after a sub-agency in the Department of Labor reviewed its guidance to determine if it was relevant and current, the sub-agency was able to reduce its guidance by 85 percent. Consistent with GAO recommendations, the Committee believes Departments and agencies funded in this act need to make more progress in adhering to and implementing OMB's 2007 ''Final Bul-letin for Agency Good Guidance Practices,'' which establishes poli-cies and procedures for the development, issuance, and use of sig-nificant guidance documents by executive branch departments and agencies. The Committee recommends that guidance documents include a statement explaining why the agency believes it is appropriate to issue guidance about a matter instead of proposing a regulation and the specific statutory provisions or regulation(s) the guidance is interpreting. The Committee further recommends all guidance documents be posted in one place on its Web site as well as on the relevant sub-agency Web page. This information should be easily accessible for the public to comment on guidance. Finally, when ap-propriate, guidance should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget for review if it is significant. 14 BILL-WIDE DIRECTIVES Children Exposed to Trauma .\u2014The Committee encourages the Departments and agencies funded in this bill to enhance coordina-tion on activities that address child trauma, including data collec-tion and awarding grants. The Committee encourages the Depart-ments and agencies to examine practices already supported by Fed-eral agencies and solicit public feedback in order to identify, rec-ommend, and disseminate best practices for the identification, re-ferral, and implementation of trauma-informed interventions in child and youth-serving settings. The Committee further encour-ages the Departments and agencies to promote programs that in-corporate trauma-informed best practices, including two- generational interventions, integration or co-location of mental health services, or training front-line service providers in under-standing trauma and implementing appropriate responses. Further, the Committee is interested in the expansion of Per- formance Partnerships to identify strategies to improve the effec-tiveness of and increase opportunities for collaboration in Federal programs serving children exposed to trauma. The Committee re-quests that the GAO issue a report to explore the potential oppor-tunities for such pilots in this area, including identifying signifi-cant Federal programs that are commonly used to provide services to children exposed to trauma; identifying overlapping but varying eligibility rules, allowable uses of funds, and other requirements, including reporting requirements, in such programs; and identi-fying barriers or challenges commonly faced by organizations re-ceiving funding from multiple Federal programs to serve children exposed to trauma. Congressional Budget Justifications .\u2014Congressional justifica- tions are the primary tool used for the Committee to evaluate budget requests and resource requirements. The Committee ex-pects the fiscal year 2019 congressional justifications to include suf-ficient detail to justify all programs, projects, and activities con-tained in each department, agency, board, corporation, or commis-sion's budget request. The justifications shall include a sufficient level of detailed data, exhibits, and explanatory statements to sup-port the appropriations requests, including tables that outline each agency's programs, projects, and activities for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Specifically, every bill and report number included in either the House of Representatives or Senate Appropriations bill or re-port or the final appropriations bill or explanatory statement of the fiscal year should be reflected within these justifications. The Committee directs the chief financial officer of each depart- ment, agency, board, corporation, or commission funded in this act's jurisdiction to ensure that adequate justification is given to support each increase, decrease, and staffing change proposed in the fiscal year 2019 budget. When requesting additional resources, reduced funding, or eliminations of programs, changes should be outlined with an adequate justification. Should the final fiscal year 2018 appropriations bill be enacted within a timeframe that does not allow it to be reflected within the congressional justifications for fiscal year 2019, the Committee directs each department, agen-cy, board, corporation, or commission funded in this act to submit 15 within 30 days of enactment updated information to the Committee on funding comparisons to fiscal year 2018. Two Generation Approaches to Poverty Reduction .\u2014The Com- mittee is also interested in the expansion of Performance Partner-ships to identify strategies to increase opportunities for collabora-tion in Federal programs to carry out two-generational approaches to poverty reduction. The Committee requests that GAO issue a re-port to explore the potential for pilots in this area, including identi-fying significant Federal programs that could be used for two- generational approaches to poverty reduction; identifying potential opportunities for collaboration between such programs; identifying overlapping but varying eligibility rules, allowable uses of funds, and other requirements, including reporting requirements, in such programs; and identifying barriers or challenges commonly faced, or potentially faced, by organizations receiving funding from mul-tiple Federal programs in implementing two-generation approaches to poverty reduction. OTHER HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BILL Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education [CHGME] .\u2014 The Committee recommendation includes $305,000,000 for CHGME, an increase of $5,000,000 above fiscal year 2017. This funding supports freestanding children's teaching hospitals to pro-vide Graduate Medical Education for physicians. Community Health Centers [CHC] .\u2014The Committee rec- ommendation includes $1,491,522,000 for CHC's, level with fiscal year 2017. The Committee's recommendation is projected to sup-port 26 million patients and continues quality improvement activi-ties for more than 1,400 health centers operating over 10,400 pri-mary sites. Corporation for Public Broadcasting .\u2014The bill continues advance funding in the amount of $445,000,000 for the Corporation for Pub-lic Broadcasting [CPB] and an additional $20,000,000 to continue the interconnection project. Corporation for National and Community Service .\u2014The Com- mittee recommendation includes $386,010,000 for AmeriCorps State and National Grants, $30,000,000 for NCCC, $92,364,000 for VISTA, and $202,117,000 for Senior Corps, all the same as the fis-cal year 2017 funding levels. Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Programs .\u2014The bill in- cludes $5,000,000 for a new initiative to support clinical training of sexual assault nurse examiners (including registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and nurse midwives) to administer medical fo-rensic examinations and treatments to victims of sexual assault in hospitals, health centers, and other emergency healthcare settings. The bill also includes an additional $5,000,000, a 30 percent in-crease, in the tribal set-aside for Family Violence Prevention and Services programs, as well as an increase of $5,000,000 to CDC's Rape Prevention and Education program. Finally, the bill provides an increase of $2,000,000 to the Victims of Trafficking program, which provides a variety of services to victims of commercial sex and forced labor trafficking. Institute for Museum and Library Services [IMLS] .\u2014The Com- mittee recommendation includes $235,000,000 for crease of $4,000,000 above fiscal year 2017. This funding supports 123,000 libraries and 35,000 museums, ensuring that all Ameri-cans have access to essential museum, library, and information services. Medicare Appeals Backlog .\u2014The Committee continues to be con- cerned that the Office of Medicare Hearing and Appeals [OMHA] has a current case backlog of approximately 600,000 cases. The bill directs $10,000,000 in Recovery Audit Contractor [RAC] funds be available to OMHA and the Departmental Appeals Board to proc-ess RAC-related appeals. Rural Health and Telehealth .\u2014The Committee continues to prioritize funding for telehealth and the impact it is having on ac-cess to care for medically underserved and rural populations. The Committee recommendation includes $160,560,000 for Rural Health programs, an increase of $4,500,000 above fiscal year 2017. Included in that amount is $21,000,000 for the Office for the Ad-vancement of Telehealth [OAT], an increase of $2,500,000 above fiscal year 2017. Supporting Local Control in Elementary and Secondary Edu- cation .\u2014The Committee continues to prioritize funding for elemen- tary and secondary education programs that provide the most flexi-bility for states, school districts, schools, and parents to make edu-cation decisions impacting students and families. \u2014$15,485,210,000, an increase of $25,408,000 for title I grants to LEAs \u2014$450,000,000, an increase of $50,000,000 for title IV Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants \u2014$1,340,112,000, an increase of $11,509,000 for Impact Aid \u2014$367,172,000, an increase of $25,000,000 for the Charter Schools Program Training Assistance to Appalachian Regional Commission [ARC] and Delta Regional Authority [DRA] regions .\u2014The bill broadens and adapts an initiative within the Dislocated Worker National Re-serve from the last two fiscal years. The initiative is intended to ensure reemployment and training assistance is provided to work-ers dislocated in rural areas of the country hit hardest by the re-cession and recovering more slowly. The bill devotes $30,000,000 to assist unemployed workers from any industry within the ARC and DRA regions to adapt existing skills and learn new ones demanded by growing industries. Veterans Employment and Training Service .\u2014The Committee in- cludes $284,041,000, an increase of $5,000,000. This amount in-cludes funding to expand transition assistance for separating serv-ice members and to implement the Honoring Investments in Re-cruiting and Employing [HIRE] American Military Veterans Act of 2017. WIOA State Grants .\u2014The bill includes $2,709,832,000 for em- ployment training grants distributed by formula to States under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. These grants, which provide tremendous flexibility to State and local govern-ments to meet their own unique job training needs, form the bed-rock of the Federal workforce development effort. The Committee recommendation maintains funding for several other important programs including: 17 \u2014$86,125,000 for the Bureau of International Labor Affairs \u2014$2,318,781,000 for Ryan White AIDS Programs \u2014$660,000,000 Public Health Emergency Preparedness Coopera- tive Agreement \u2014$562,571,000 for Mental Health Block Grant \u2014$3,390,304,000 for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP] \u2014$2,856,000,000 for the Child Care and Development Block Grant \u2014$9,253,095,000 for Head Start \u2014$837,753,000 for Nutrition programs, including Meals on Wheels programs \u2014$47,115,000 for the State Health Insurance Program \u2014$254,555,000 Hospital Preparedness Program \u2014$511,700,000 for Biomedical Advanced Research and Develop- ment Authority \u2014$510,000,000 for Project BioShield \u2014$12,002,848,000 for IDEA Grants to States (Part B, Section 611) \u2014$1,191,673,000 for 21st Century Community Learning Centers \u2014$2,055,830,000 for Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants \u2014$1,117,598,000 for Career and Technical Education State Grants \u2014$733,130,000 for Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants \u2014$989,728,000 for Federal Work Study \u2014$274,224,000 for National Labor Relations Board (18) TITLE I DEPARTMENT OF LABOR EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING ADMINISTRATION TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $3,338,699,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 2,053,766,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,335,199,000 The Training and Employment Services account provides funding primarily for activities under the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-tunity Act [WIOA], and is a decentralized, integrated system of skill training and related services designed to enhance the employ-ment and earnings of economically disadvantaged and dislocated workers. Funds provided for many training programs for fiscal year 2018 will support the program from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019. A portion of this account's funding, $1,772,000,000, is avail-able on October 1, 2018, for the 2018 program year. Any references in this title of the report to the ''Secretary'' or the ''Department'' shall be interpreted to mean the Secretary of Labor or the Department of Labor, respectively, unless otherwise noted. The Committee strongly encourages the Department to continue to work with other Federal agencies to align and streamline em- ployment and training services. In cases where legislation would be required to achieve these goals, the President's budget request should include recommendations and specific proposals for consoli-dation of programs. The Committee urges the Department to continue and expand its efforts in preparing workers for in-demand occupations through a coordinated Federal, State, and local strategy. This strategy should include close engagement with employers by all levels of the work-force development system to ensure that provided training services align with the demands of those who would hire program partici-pants. The Committee encourages the Employment and Training Ad- ministration [ETA] to expand its collaborative work with the Insti-tute for Museum and Library Services to assist in the implementa-tion of WIOA to assist States and local boards in integrating the education, employment, and training services provided by public li-braries into the workforce investment system. The Committee also encourages ETA to continue to invest in building and strength-ening partnerships between the one-stop system and public librar-ies by encouraging applicants for competitive grant opportunities to collaborate with public libraries. The Committee continues to believe that the Pay for Performance authority under WIOA is a promising, innovative approach to using data, evidence, and evaluation to improve workforce development 19 outcomes for the most vulnerable citizens. The Committee encour- ages the Department to continue to provide technical assistance to States and localities to help them utilize Pay for Performance strat-egies. The Committee has been made aware of concerns about short- ages nationwide of well-trained drinking water and wastewater management professionals. Safe and effective water utility manage-ment is in the national interest. The Committee strongly urges the Department to evaluate these concerns and to consider innovative ways to address the shortage of trained water system management professionals through the WIOA system. Grants to States The Committee recommends $2,709,832,000 for Training and Employment Services Grants to States. Under WIOA, a local board is given up to 100 percent transfer authority between Adult and Dislocated Worker activities upon ap-proval of the Governor. The Committee recommendation is consistent with the WIOA au- thorization regarding the amount of WIOA State grant funding that may be reserved by Governors. Adult Employment and Training .\u2014For adult employment and training activities, the Committee recommends $815,556,000. Formula funding is provided to States and further distributed to local workforce investment areas through one-stop centers. The program provides employment and training services to disadvan-taged, low-skilled, unemployed, and underemployed adults, includ-ing veterans. Funds are made available in this bill for adult employment and training activities in program year 2018, which occurs from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019. The bill provides that $103,556,000 is available for obligation on July 1, 2018, and that $712,000,000 is available on October 1, 2018. Both categories of funding are available for obligation through June 30, 2019. Youth Training .\u2014For youth training activities, the Committee recommends $873,416,000. The purpose of this program is to provide low-income youth fac- ing barriers to employment with services that prepare them to suc-ceed in the knowledge-based economy. Funds are made available for youth training activities in program year 2018, which occurs from April 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019. The Department is directed to carry out an evaluation of the use of Youth Activities funds under WIOA to support youth in areas with high crime rates. This evaluation should include a description of the activities carried out by local workforce development boards in high crime areas and the number of youth being served in these areas. In addition, it should identify successful models for youth workforce development in high crime areas. The Department is en-couraged to continue pilot or demonstration programs that have been demonstrated to be effective. Dislocated Worker Assistance .\u2014For dislocated worker assistance, the Committee recommends $1,020,860,000. This program is a State-operated effort that provides training services and support to help permanently separated workers return 20 to productive unsubsidized employment. In addition, States must use State-wide reserve funds for rapid response assistance to help workers affected by mass layoffs and plant closures. States must also use these funds to carry out additional State-wide employment and training activities such as providing technical assistance to certain low-performing local areas, evaluating State programs, and assisting with the operation of one-stop delivery systems. States may also use funds for implementing innovative training programs. Funds made available in this bill support activities in program year 2018, which occurs from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019. The bill provides that $160,860,000 is available for obligation on July 1, 2018, and that $860,000,000 is available on October 1, 2018. Both categories of funding are available for obligation through June 30, 2019. Federally Administered Programs Dislocated Worker Assistance National Reserve .\u2014The Committee recommends $220,859,000 for the Dislocated Worker Assistance National Reserve, which is available to the Secretary for activities such as responding to mass layoffs, plant and/or military base clos-ings, and natural disasters that cannot be otherwise anticipated, as well as for technical assistance, training, and demonstration projects. Funds made available for the National Reserve in this bill sup- port activities in program year 2018. The bill provides that $20,859,000 is available for obligation on July 1, 2018, and that $200,000,000 is available on October 1, 2018. Both categories of funding are available for obligation through September 30, 2019. The Committee bill makes $30,000,000 available for obligation on October 1, 2017, through September 30, 2019, to provide enhanced dislocated worker training to promote economic recovery in the Ap-palachian and Delta regions. The bill rescinds $30,000,000 from fis-cal year 2018 Dislocated Worker National Reserve advances appro-priated in the fiscal year 2017 act and reappropriates it for this purpose. The initiative will include projects for dislocated workers within the Delta Regional Authority [DRA] and Appalachian Regional Commission [ARC] areas. These regions have been particularly hard hit by industrial downsizing and closures, and funding is pro-vided to target these underserved areas. The Department is strong-ly urged to engage proactively with Workforce Development Boards and other appropriate entities at the State and local levels, includ-ing those typically involved in applying for and administering Na-tional Dislocated Worker Grants to ensure that they are aware of the availability of the targeted funds so they will be sought and utilized promptly and effectively to assist workers in areas hardest hit by job loss. The Department, DRA, and ARC are directed to jointly brief the Committee not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on an operating plan, community engagement, and progress made on this program and shall update the Committee quarterly thereafter until all funds are expended. The Committee recognizes Federal infrastructure investment and reorganization, such as the relocation of an agency headquarters, can lead to major construction projects in local areas. Such projects 21 result in positive regional employment opportunities as well as challenges to prepare new workers and dislocated workers to fill these jobs. This surge in need for job training does not arise from a negative incident like a natural disaster or a major industrial layoff, but it results in similar workforce preparation needs. In light of these ongoing Federal infrastructure investments, the Sec-retary is urged to find innovative ways to enhance workforce train-ing capabilities in areas that have the opportunity to train and re-train local workforces to meet the construction needs related to new Federal investments. Indian and Native American Programs .\u2014The Committee rec- ommends $50,000,000 for Indian and Native American Programs. These programs are designed to improve the academic, occupa-tional, and literacy skills of Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians to aid the participants in securing perma-nent, unsubsidized employment. Allowable training services include adult basic education, GED attainment, literacy training, English language training, as well as the establishment of linkages with re-medial education. The Committee directs the Department to obligate funding at the authorized levels for activities pursuant to section 166(k) of subtitle D of title I of the WIOA. Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Programs .\u2014The Committee recommends $81,896,000 for migrant and seasonal farmworkers programs, which serve members of economically disadvantaged families whose principal livelihood is derived from migratory and other forms of seasonal farm work, fishing, or logging activities. Enrollees and their families are provided with employment, train-ing, and related services intended to prepare them for stable, year- round employment within and outside of the agriculture industry. The Committee recommendation provides that $75,885,000 be used for State service area grants. The Committee recommendation also includes bill language directing that $5,517,000 be used for mi-grant and seasonal farmworker housing grants, of which not less than 70 percent shall be for permanent housing. The principal pur-pose of these funds is to continue the network of local farmworker housing organizations working on permanent housing solutions for migrant and seasonal farmworkers. The Committee recommenda-tion also includes $494,000 to be used for section 167 training, technical assistance, and related activities, including funds for mi-grant rest center activities. The Committee is concerned by continued labor shortages in the agricultural sector. The Committee directs the Department to en-sure that agricultural worker training programs funded under sec-tion 167 of WIOA prioritize the development of additional and en-hanced skills specifically relevant to continued agricultural work. YouthBuild .\u2014The Committee strongly supports the YouthBuild program and recommends $84,534,000 to support its work to target at-risk high school dropouts and prepare them with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in a knowledge-based economy. YouthBuild helps low-income young people learn valuable, market-able job skills by combining educational resources, a supportive en-vironment, and real construction experience with the successful completion of more than 30,000 units of affordable housing for low- 22 income communities since 1994. There are currently over 220 YouthBuild programs across the country serving more than 6,000 youth per year. National Activities Reintegration of Ex-Offenders .\u2014The Committee recommends $88,078,000 for the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program helps prepare and assist adult ex-offenders return to their communities through pre-release services, mentoring, and case management. The program also pro-vides support, opportunities, education, and training to youth who are involved in court and on probation, in aftercare, on parole, or who would benefit from alternatives to incarceration or diversion from formal judicial proceedings. Programs are carried out directly through State and local governmental entities and community based organizations, as well as indirectly through intermediary or-ganizations. States are encouraged to continue to support re-integration efforts for ex-offenders with resources available through the comprehensive workforce development investment system. The Committee directs the Department to use funding to support efforts in high-crime, high-poverty areas and, in particular, communities that are seeking to address relevant impacts and root causes of civil unrest and high levels of community violence. The Committee directs the Department to require grantees to offer training and in-dustry-recognized credentials that meet the needs of local, high-de-mand industries and to establish formal partnerships and job- placement services with industry employers. Evaluation .\u2014The bill continues to use a set-aside funding mech- anism to support the evaluation of employment and training pro-grams. Instead of directly providing funds for evaluation, the Com-mittee recommendation supports evaluation activities through a 0.75 percent set-aside on all training and employment programs, including the WIOA formula programs, Job Corps, Community Service Employment for Older Americans, the Employment Service, and others. The set-aside approach ensures that sufficient funding is available to carry out comprehensive evaluation and applied re-search activities. ETA will continue to conduct evaluation and applied research ac- tivities in consultation with the Department's chief evaluation offi-cer, who oversees the evaluation program. Results will inform pol-icy, advance the Department's mission, and improve its perform-ance-based management initiatives. Workforce Data Quality Initiative .\u2014The Committee recommends $5,000,000 for the Workforce Data Quality Initiative. Funds are used to assist States with incorporating comprehensive workforce information into longitudinal data systems being developed in part with the support of funding provided by the Department of Edu-cation. The initiative is also intended to help improve the quality and accessibility of performance data being produced by training providers. Apprenticeship Grants .\u2014The recommendation includes $95,000,000 for continued support for the apprenticeship program that the Committee created in fiscal year 2016. This funding shall be for making competitive contracts and to continue funding grants 23 to States and industry partnerships. The Department is directed to ensure approval of apprenticeship opportunities that engage, re-cruit, and serve women and other under-represented populations and local communities that have high rates of unemployment and high levels of community violence. The Committee also directs the Department to collaborate with the Delta Regional Authority to de-velop a targeted apprenticeship and job training program to meet the unique needs of underserved rural communities in this region. The Committee recognizes the role that sector partnerships play in organizing key stakeholders in an industry cluster to address the shared goals and human resources needs of the industry cluster. The Committee supports the funding and development of industry or sector partnerships as a means of closing the skills gap and ex-panding apprenticeships in in-demand industries. The Department is encouraged to develop a nationally-recognized apprenticeship standard to enhance the skills and workforce opportunities for water utility related jobs. The Committee also notes the Depart-ment's proposal to use $100,000,000 in high-tech job training funds available under the authority of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act to further expand the program. The Committee encourages the Secretary to ensure approval of appren- ticeship opportunities that are already effective and substantially widespread, including, but not limited to, programs certified by the National Center for Construction Education and Research [NCCER] as Industry-Recognized Apprenticeships. JOB CORPS Appropriations, 2017 ........................................................................... 1,448,444,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,699,155,000 The recommendation for operations of Job Corps centers is $1,699,155,000, a decrease of $5,000,000 from fiscal year 2017. The Committee remains deeply concerned about the issue of stu- dent safety on Job Corps campuses across the country as well as findings by the Department's Office of Inspector General [OIG] re-garding the enforcement of Job Corps' disciplinary policies, poten-tially exposing students to unsafe environments. The Committee recognizes the Department has taken important steps toward ad-dressing these issues and strongly urges the Department to take fully corrective actions to ensure the safety of students and staff. The Committee recommendation for administrative costs is $32,330,000. The Committee also recommends a total of $79,500,000 in con- struction, renovation, and acquisition [CRA] funds, a decrease of $5,000,000 from fiscal year 2017. This amount is available from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2020. The Committee continues bill lan-guage allowing the Secretary to transfer up to 15 percent of CRA funds, if necessary, to meet the operational needs of Job Corps cen-ters or to achieve administrative efficiencies. The bill continues to require the Secretary to notify the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations at least 15 days in advance of any transfer. The Committee expects any notification to include a justification. While most Job Corps centers meet or exceed program standards, there are some centers that are chronically low-performing and 24 have remained so despite significant and long-term Departmental intervention. The Committee expects the Department to use WIOA performance measures as the key component for developing its methodology for identifying centers for closure and to adhere to the process for closing a Job Corps center as described in section 159 of WIOA, which includes advance announcement to the general public of the proposed closure; 30 day comment period for inter-ested parties to submit written comments to the Secretary; and no-tification to the Members of Congress who represent the district or State in which such center is located. Further, the Committee strongly encourages the Department to provide Job Corps students enrolled in a closing low-performing center the opportunity to transfer to another higher-performing Job Corps center. Finally, the Committee requests a detailed description of the Department's plan for identifying centers for closure, including a definition of a ''low-performing center,'' the methodology used for identifying those centers, and a timeline for the closure process. The Committee ex-pects to receive this information no later than 180 days after the enactment of this act or at least 30 days prior to any public notice published in the Federal Register. The Job Corps program provides disconnected youth with the education and job training necessary to successfully enter the workforce and earn a living wage. The Committee urges the Office of Job Corps to increase recruitment efforts, particularly in areas experiencing increased levels of community violence. Technological limitations can hinder students' preparation for the high-tech 21st century college and work environment. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Department to utilize available funds for upgrading the telecommunications infrastructure of Job Corps centers to provide students access to online learning and job search tools in appropriate campus buildings. The Committee urges the Secretary to ensure that Job Corps center operators are providing effective professional development for their staff. Without consistent and on-going training, the qual-ity of services, as well as the safety and security of the students and staff, can be compromised. The Secretary is encouraged to en-sure that adequate contract funds, as direct contract allowable costs, are available for center instructor training and related travel costs to maintain a high level of staff qualifications and student work-based learning opportunities. The Department is requested to report within 120 days of the enactment of this Act, on how profes-sional development is provided to center staff by the Office of Job Corps and center operators, especially in the areas of safety, secu-rity, education, and training. Further, the Department is requested to report to Congress on the competitiveness of Job Corps teacher and instructor salaries, as well as staff retention and vacancy rates. Funds should not be used to award a new contract for operation of a Job Corps center, unless ETA ensures that each of the factors listed in section 147(a)(3) of WIOA are applied to the procurement process to award a new contract to operate a Job Corps center as well as to any decision to restrict competition. Gulfport Job Corps Center .\u2014The Committee continues to be en- couraged by the progress made toward rebuilding the Gulfport Job 25 Corps Center, including the Memorandum of Agreement signed by the Department and the City of Gulfport. The Committee expects the Department to complete the Section 106 process, complete the design of the new Center, and open request for contracts as quickly as possible. Despite transition to a new Administration, the Com-mittee expects the Department to remain diligently committed to ensuring that the Center is rebuilt and able to return to serving the number of young people that it once served while, in the mean-time, reserving sufficient funds for the restoration of the facility consistent with the expectations of the Committee. Given that Con-gress provided emergency appropriations for this purpose shortly after the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, the Committee con-tinues to direct the Department to prioritize the Gulfport Job Corps Center among pending construction cases in the CRA. The Com-mittee requests to be updated every 30 days regarding progress on this project. COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT FOR OLDER AMERICANS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $400,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... ........................... Committee recommendation ................................................................. 400,000,000 Community Service Employment for Older Americans [CSEOA] provides part-time employment in community service activities for unemployed, low-income persons aged 55 and older. The Committee recommendation includes $400,000,000 for CSEOA. FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $849,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 790,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 790,000,000 The Committee recommendation includes mandatory funds for the Federal unemployment benefits and allowances program that assists trade-impacted workers with benefits and services to up-grade skills and retrain in new careers. These benefits and services are designed to help participants find a path back into middle-class jobs, improve earnings, and increase credential and education rates. The Committee recommendation provides for the full oper-ation of the Trade Adjustment Act program in fiscal year 2018 con-sistent with current law. The Trade Adjustment Assistance [TAA] program provides as- sistance to workers who have been adversely affected by inter-national trade. TAA provides benefits and services to those who qualify, to include: job training, job search and relocation allow-ances, and wage supplements for workers age 50 and older. STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICE OPERATIONS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $3,523,691,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 3,213,159,000 The Committee recommendation includes $3,378,625,000 author- ized to be drawn from the Employment Security Administration ac-26 count of the Unemployment Trust Fund and $84,066,000 to be pro- vided from the general fund of the Treasury. The funds in this account are used to provide administrative grants and assistance to State agencies that administer Federal and State unemployment compensation laws and operate the public employment service. The account is workload based, and due to the improving economy, fewer unemployment applications are being processed. Therefore less funding is required for this purpose as re-flected in the bill. The Committee recommends a total of $2,651,497,000 for UI ac- tivities. For UI State operations, the Committee recommends $2,637,600,000. Of these funds, the Committee includes $130,000,000, an increase of $15,000,000, to expand intensive, indi-vidualized reemployment assistance and to help address and pre-vent long-term unemployment and reduce improper payments through the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments [RESEA] initiative. As State consortia continue work to modernize their UI informa- tion technology systems with newly-appropriated fiscal year 2017 funds, the Committee expects the Department to closely support and oversee the consortia's efforts and to keep the Committee on Appropriations informed on how new funds are utilized and progress on system development. The Committee recommendation includes $6,000,000 for the UI Integrity Center of Excellence, including supporting an integrated data hub, training modules, and data analytics capacity to help States reduce fraud. The Committee recommendation provides for a contingency re- serve amount should the unemployment workload exceed an aver-age weekly insured claims volume of 2,246,000. The Committee recommends $13,897,000 for UI national activi- ties, which will support activities that benefit the entire Federal- State UI system, including supporting the continuation of IT up-grades and technical assistance. For the Employment Service allotments to States, the Committee recommends $666,413,000. This amount includes $21,413,000 in general funds together with an authorization to spend $645,000,000 from the Employment Security Administration ac-count of the Unemployment Trust Fund. The Committee also recommends $19,818,000 for Employment Service national activities. The administration of the work oppor-tunity tax credit program accounts for $18,485,000 of the rec-ommended amount; the remainder is for technical assistance and training to States. For carrying out the Department's responsibilities related to for- eign labor certification activities, the Committee recommends $48,028,000. In addition, 5 percent of the revenue from H-1B fees is available to the Department for costs associated with processing H-1B alien labor certification applications, and $14,282,000, the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level, is available for related State grants. The Committee remains concerned about efficient, effective man- agement of the H-2B and H-2A programs. Unacceptable proc-essing delays in the past two years have degraded the effectiveness 27 of the programs for those who depend on them for meeting short- term, seasonal surges in demand. Authority was included in fiscal year 2017 to utilize H-1B fee receipts through fiscal year 2018 to augment processing capacity. This short-term authority was in-tended to prevent excessive labor certification and wage determina-tion delays while the Department develops improved administra-tive procedures for the longer term. The Committee expects the De-partment to provide timely updates about the use of the fee author-ity and Department's longer-term plans to improve the efficiency of these programs. In the determination of prevailing wage for the purposes of the H-2B program, the Secretary shall accept private wage surveys even in instances where Occupational Employment Statistics [OES] survey data are available unless the Secretary determines that the methodology and data in the provided survey are not statistically supported. The bill continues general provisions related to enforce-ment of H-2B regulations. Additionally, the Committee has been informed of instances in which certain job duties related to seafood processing have been categorized by the Department into OES wage rate categories that may not accurately reflect the work being performed by workers normally placed in that category, resulting in inaccurate prevailing wage determinations for many seafood workers. Therefore, the Committee strongly urges the Department to establish an OES wage rate category for seafood processing. For one-stop career centers and labor market information, the Committee recommends $62,653,000. The Committee includes $2,500,000 to finalize the work of the collaborative effort with States to reduce unnecessary occupational licensing barriers. The Committee included $15,000,000 over the past two fiscal years to establish occupational licensing grants for State consortia to iden-tify, explore, and address areas where licensing requirements cre-ate an unnecessary barrier to labor market entry or labor mobility across State lines. The Committee appreciates the Secretary's sup-port of pursing cooperative approaches to enhance reciprocity or portability of occupational licenses across State lines. Such agree-ments would significantly ease barriers to opportunity and reem-ployment for thousands of Americans, especially for military spouses, dislocated workers, and transitioning service members. The Committee directs the Department to report, within 60 days of enactment of this Act, on progress and outcomes of the occupa-tional licensing portability initiative funded in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017. These funds also support system capacity building efforts which allow the American Job Center network to respond to the needs of the job seekers and businesses in the current economy, including the Disability Employment Initiative. When reviewing investment alternatives for the Disability Employment Initiative in fiscal year 2018, the Committee directs that the Department strongly consider needs in rural, underserved States especially in cases where mean-ingful applicant partnerships exist with institutions of higher learning and the workforce investment system. 28 ADVANCES TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND AND OTHER FUNDS The Committee bill continues language providing such sums as necessary in mandatory funds for this account. The appropriation is available to provide advances to several accounts for purposes authorized under various Federal and State unemployment com-pensation laws and the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, when-ever balances in such accounts prove insufficient. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $158,656,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 154,265,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 158,656,000 The Committee recommendation of $158,656,000 for program ad- ministration includes $108,674,000 in general funds and $49,982,000 from the Employment Security Administration account of the Unemployment Trust Fund. General funds in this account pay for the Federal staff needed to administer employment and training programs under WIOA, OAA, the Trade Act of 1974, and the National Apprenticeship Act. Trust funds provide for the Federal administration of employment security, training and employment, and executive direction func-tions. E MPLOYEE BENEFITS SECURITY ADMINISTRATION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $181,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 183,926,000 Committee recommendation The Committee recommends the Employee Ben- efits Security Administration [EBSA]. EBSA is responsible for the enforcement of title I of ERISA in both civil and criminal areas and for enforcement of sections 8477 and 8478 of the Federal Employ-ees' Retirement Security Act of 1986. EBSA administers an inte-grated program of regulation, compliance assistance and education, civil and criminal enforcement, and research and analysis. New au-thority is provided, as requested, making $3,000,000 available through September 30, 2019. These funds may be used to facilitate procurement of expert outside witnesses for enforcement litigation. The authority will be useful in situations where services may be needed for cases extending beyond the end of the fiscal year. P ENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's [PBGC's] estimated obligations for fiscal year 2018 include single-employer benefit pay-ments of $6,770,000,000, multi-employer financial assistance of $169,000,000, and consolidated administrative expenses of $522,917,000. Administrative expenses are comprised of three ac-tivities: pension insurance activities, pension plan termination ex-penses, and operational support. These expenditures are financed by permanent authority. Previously, the Committee accepted the PBGC's proposal to reform the previous administrative apportion-ment classifications from three budget activities to one budget ac-29 tivity to make operations more efficient and improve stewardship of resources. That consolidated approach for the three activities is continued, but PBGC is directed to continue providing detail every year on the three activities in its annual congressional budget jus-tification. Funding requested by PBGC in fiscal year 2017 to consolidate three separate headquarters facilities into one combined location was provided in full. Therefore requested funds are not included for that purpose in fiscal year 2018. The PBGC is a wholly owned Government corporation estab- lished by ERISA. The law places it within DOL and makes the Sec-retary the chair of its board of directors. The Corporation receives its income primarily from insurance premiums collected from cov-ered pension plans, assets of terminated pension plans, collection of employer liabilities imposed by the act, and investment earnings. The primary purpose of the PBGC is to guarantee the payment of pension plan benefits to participants if covered defined benefit plans fail or go out of existence. The bill continues authority for a contingency fund for the PBGC that provides additional administrative resources when the number of participants in terminated plans exceeds 100,000. When the trig-ger is reached, an additional $9,200,000 becomes available through September 30, 2019, for every 20,000 additional participants in ter-minated plans. The Committee bill also continues authority allow-ing the PBGC additional obligation authority for unforeseen and extraordinary pre-termination expenses, after approval by OMB and notification of the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Committee recognizes PBGC's ''Smaller Asset Managers Pilot Program'' to ensure that smaller and more diverse investment management entities more effectively compete for investment allo-cations. The project, announced in 2015 and now underway, pro-vided access to smaller allocations ranging from $50,000,000 to $250,000,000, creating new opportunities for smaller asset man-agers to participate. Similarly, several States have established pro-grams to encourage greater participation by smaller and diverse asset management entities, and studies have found that women and minority-owned firms have achieved at least comparable per-formance, both in terms of absolute returns and risk-adjusted re-turns, as the rest of the market. The Committee directs the PBGC to provide by December 31, 2017, an interim update on the per-formance of the pilot program, as well as a written account of addi-tional steps that can be explored to expand opportunities for small-er and diverse asset management entities. W AGE AND HOUR DIVISION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $227,500,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 230,068,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 227,500,000 The Committee recommends $227,500,000 for the Wage and Hour Division [WHD]. 30 WHD is responsible for administering and enforcing laws that provide minimum standards for wages and working conditions in the United States. The Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA], employ- ment rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act [FMLA], and the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act are several of the important laws that WHD is charged with admin-istering and/or enforcing. O FFICE OF LABOR -MANAGEMENT STANDARDS SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $38,187,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 46,634,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 40,187,000 The Committee recommends $40,187,000 for the Office of Labor- Management Standards [OLMS]. OLMS administers the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclo- sure Act of 1959 [LMRDA] and related laws. These laws establish safeguards for union democracy and financial integrity. They also require public disclosure by unions, union officers, employers, and others. In addition, the Office administers employee protections under federally sponsored transportation programs. O FFICE OF FEDERAL CONTRACT COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $104,476,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 88,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 103,476,000 The Committee recommends $103,476,000 for the Office of Fed- eral Contract Compliance Programs [OFCCP]. This Office protects workers and potential employees of Federal contractors from employment discrimination prohibited under Ex-ecutive Order 11246, section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. The Committee rejects the budget's proposal to begin plans to merge the OFCCP with the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-mission. The Committee strongly urges OFCCP to find efficiencies and cost savings, including the consolidation of offices, within its current budget structure. This should include a review of the cur-rent OFCCP office locations and infrastructure across the country and whether these offices align with current workload needs. OFCCP is directed to report to the Committee with an inventory of current infrastructure and a plan to consolidate and right-size the agency 180 days after enactment of this Act. O FFICE OF WORKERS ' COMPENSATION PROGRAMS SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $117,601,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 115,282,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 117,601,000 31 The Committee recommends $117,601,000 for the Office of Work- ers' Compensation [OWCP]. The bill provides authority to expend $2,177,000 from the special fund established by the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. OWCP administers four distinct compensation programs: the Federal Employees' Compensation Act [FECA], the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, the Black Lung Benefits pro-grams, and the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensa-tion Program. In addition, OWCP houses the Division of Informa-tion Technology Management and Services. SPECIAL BENEFITS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $220,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 220,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 220,000,000 The Committee recommends $220,000,000 for this account. This mandatory appropriation, which is administered by OWCP, pri-marily provides benefits under FECA. The Committee recommends continuation of appropriations lan- guage to provide authority to require disclosure of Social Security numbers by individuals filing claims under FECA or the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act and its extensions. The Committee continues appropriations language that provides authority to use FECA funds to reimburse a new employer for a portion of the salary of a newly reemployed injured Federal worker. FECA funds will be used to reimburse new employers during the first 3 years of employment, not to exceed 75 percent of salary in the worker's first year, and declining thereafter. The Committee continues language that allows carryover of un- obligated balances to be used in the following year and that pro-vides authority to draw such sums as are needed after August 15 to pay current beneficiaries. Such funds are charged to the subse-quent year appropriation. The Committee recommends continuation of appropriations lan- guage to provide authority to deposit into the special benefits ac-count of the employees' compensation fund those funds that the Postal Service, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and other entities are required to pay to cover their fair share of the costs of admin-istering the claims filed by their employees under FECA. Finally, the Committee maintains language consistent with long- standing interpretations and implementation of this appropriation stating that, along with the other compensation statutes already specifically enumerated, the appropriation is used to pay obliga-tions that arise under the War Hazards Compensation Act, and the appropriation is deposited in the Employees' Compensation Fund and assumes its attributes, namely availability without time limit as provided by 5 U.S.C. section 8147. SPECIAL BENEFITS FOR DISABLED COAL MINERS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $61,319,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 54,319,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 54,319,000 The Committee recommends a mandatory appropriation of $54,319,000 in fiscal year 2018 for special benefits for disabled coal 32 miners. This is in addition to the $16,000,000 appropriated last year as an advance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, for a total program level of $70,319,000 in fiscal year 2018. The decrease in this account below the fiscal year 2017 level reflects a declining beneficiary population. These mandatory funds are used to provide monthly benefits to coal miners disabled by black lung disease and their widows and certain other dependents, as well as to pay related administrative costs. The Committee also recommends an advance appropriation of $15,000,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. These funds will ensure uninterrupted benefit payments to coal miners, their widows, and dependents. DIVISION OF ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS COMPENSATION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $59,846,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 59,846,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 59,846,000 The Committee recommends $59,846,000 for the Division of En- ergy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation. This is a man- datory appropriation. The Division administers the Energy Employees Occupational Ill- ness Compensation Program Act [EEOICPA], which provides bene-fits to eligible employees and former employees of the Department of Energy [DOE], its contractors and subcontractors, or to certain survivors of such individuals. The mission also includes delivering benefits to certain beneficiaries of the Radiation Exposure Com-pensation Act. The Division is part of OWCP. In fiscal year 2018, the volume of incoming claims under part B of EEOICPA is estimated at about 4,977 from DOE employees or survivors and private companies under contract with DOE, who suffer from a radiation-related cancer, beryllium-related disease, or chronic silicosis as a result of their work in producing or testing nuclear weapons. Under part E, approximately 4,754 new claims will be received during fiscal year 2018. Under this authority, the Department pro-vides benefits to eligible DOE contractor employees who were found to have work-related occupational illnesses due to exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility, or to the employees' survivors. The Committee is disturbed by reports that a DOL whistleblower charged that DOL's Division of Energy Employees Compensation Program thwarted workers' attempts to seek compensation by ''writing regulations that made qualification much more stringent than Congress intended, failing to disclose all the application rules, changing eligibility rules midstream, and delaying compensation for years until the sick workers died.'' Outside groups also have raised concerns about implementation of the program. Therefore, the Secretary shall implement changes to assist current and former workers navigate the EEOICPA program. The Committee expects these steps to be strongly considered: establishing a 1-800 number for current and former workers to receive information on the 33 EEOICPA claims process, including next steps after a claims is ac- cepted or denied, and assistance with completing the Occupational Health Questionnaire; developing literature on EEOICPA and the claims process, such as frequently asked questions; providing cur-rent and former workers with a copy of their entire claims file upon request in electronic or paper form; allowing Industrial Hygienists to contact current or former workers regarding their claim; and ex-tending the timeline for current or former workers to file an appeal in U.S. District Court from 60 days to 180 days when a claim is denied. BLACK LUNG DISABILITY TRUST FUND Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $373,041,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 415,162,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 415,162,000 The Committee bill provides an estimated $415,162,000 as re- quested for this mandatory appropriations account. This estimate is comprised of $69,527,000 for administrative expenses and an es-timated $345,635,000 for benefit payment and interest costs. The Committee bill continues to provide indefinite authority for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund to provide for benefit pay-ments. In addition, the bill provides for transfers from the trust fund for administrative expenses for the following Department agencies as requested: up to $38,246,000 for the part C costs of the Division of Coal Mine Workers' Compensation Programs; up to $30,595,000 for Departmental Management, Salaries and Ex-penses; and up to $330,000 for Departmental Management, Inspec-tor General. The bill also allows a transfer of up to $356,000 for the Department of the Treasury. The Trust Fund pays all black lung compensation/medical and survivor benefit expenses when no responsible mine operation can be assigned liability for such benefits or when coal mine employ-ment ceased prior to 1970, as well as all administrative costs that are incurred in administering the benefits program and operating the trust fund. O CCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $552,787,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 543,257,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 552,787,000 The Committee recommends $552,787,000 for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA], which is responsible for enforcing the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 in the Nation's workplaces. The Committee continues bill language to allow OSHA to retain course tuition and fees for training institute courses used for occu-pational safety and health training and education activities in the private sector. The cap established by the bill is $499,000, the same as current law. The bill retains language that continues to exempt farms employ- ing 10 or fewer people from the provisions of the act with the ex-ception of those farms having a temporary labor camp. The bill also 34 retains language exempting small firms in industry classifications having a lost workday injury rate less than the national average from general schedule safety inspections. The exemption of small farming operations from OSHA regula- tion has been in place since 1976. OSHA clarified the limits of its authority to conduct enforcement on small farms in July 2014, par-ticularly regarding post-harvest activities of a farming operation. The continued exemption for small farms and recognition of limits of the OSHA regulatory authority are critical for family farms. It is also important the Department of Agriculture be consulted in any future attempts by OSHA to redefine or modify any aspect of the small farm exemption. The Committee recommends $100,850,000 for grants to States under section 23(g) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. These funds primarily are provided to States that have taken re-sponsibility for administering their own occupational safety and health programs for the private sector and/or the public sector. State plans must be at least as effective as the Federal program and are monitored by OSHA. The Committee bill continues lan-guage that allows OSHA to provide grants of up to 50 percent for the costs of State plans approved by the agency. The Committee believes that OSHA's compliance assistance ac- tivities are a critical and underutilized component of a comprehen-sive approach to worker protection. This approach includes grants made to various types of organizations representing employers and labor organizations for direct training of workers on occupational safety and health. OSHA is urged to enhance its industry-specific compliance assistance efforts, including but not limited to increased informational publications and training materials available through its website and enhanced consultation services. OSHA is also urged to take additional proactive steps to make small busi-nesses and contractors more aware of the types of health and safe-ty compliance assistance and consultation available from OSHA. The Committee recommendation includes $10,537,000 for the OSHA Susan Harwood Training Grant Program and directs OSHA to dedicate no less than $3,500,000 per year for the purpose of ad-ministering the Voluntary Protection Program [VPP] in its Federal Compliance Assistance budget. OSHA shall not reduce funding lev-els or the number of employees administering the VPP, the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program [SHARP], or Federal Compliance Assistance, and shall not collect any monies from par-ticipants for the purpose of administering these programs. The Committee has created a new capacity-building setaside within the Susan Harwood training grant program to improve safe-ty training efforts. The Committee directs OSHA to work with grantees and applicants under this subsection of the program to de-velop and implement a plan to achieve self-sufficiency as required by the cited, previous application notice. Nothing in this provision should be construed to prohibit periodic recompetition of grants. The Committee recognizes that fewer injuries mean safer, more productive workers and lower worker compensation and healthcare costs. Statistical evidence for VPP success is impressive. The aver-age VPP worksite has a Days Away Restricted or Transferred [DART] case rate of 52 percent below the average for its industry. 35 These sites typically do not start out with such low rates. Reduc- tions in injuries and illnesses begin when the site commits to the VPP approach to safety and health management and the chal-lenging VPP application process. M INESAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $373,816,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 375,172,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 373,816,000 The Committee recommendation includes $373,816,000 for the Mine Safety and Health Administration [MSHA]. MSHA enforces the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act by con- ducting inspections and special investigations of mine operations, promulgating mandatory safety and health standards, cooperating with the States in developing effective State programs, and improv-ing training in conjunction with States and the mining industry. The bill continues language authorizing MSHA to use up to $2,000,000 for mine rescue and recovery activities. It also retains the provision allowing the Secretary to use any funds available to the Department to provide for the costs of mine rescue and survival operations in the event of a major disaster. To prepare properly for an actual emergency, the Committee also directs MSHA to continue to devote sufficient resources toward a competitive grant activity for effective emergency response and recovery training in various types of mine conditions. In addition, bill language is included to allow the National Mine Health and Safety Academy to collect not more than $750,000 for room, board, tuition, and the sale of training materials to be avail-able for mine safety and health education and training activities. Bill language also allows MSHA to retain up to $2,499,000 from fees collected for the approval and certification of equipment, mate-rials, and explosives for use in mines, and to utilize such sums for these activities. The Committee supports the significant advances MSHA has achieved in mine rescue and communications capabilities. To pre-pare properly for an actual mine rescue emergency, the Committee directs MSHA to continue to devote sufficient resources towards mine rescue technology by fully equipping and maintaining the ex-isting MSHA mine rescue stations. Considering changes in eco-nomic conditions throughout the mining industry in recent years, the Committee urges MSHA to provide all necessary technical ad-vice regarding mine rescue communications to State and private mine rescue teams and to ensure that all relevant MSHA grant programs prioritize mine rescue communications technology. B UREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $609,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 607,842,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 609,000,000 36 The Committee recommends $609,000,000 for the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS]. This amount includes $65,000,000 from the Employment Security Administration account of the Unemploy-ment Trust Fund and $544,000,000 in Federal funds. BLS is the principal fact finding agency in the Federal Govern- ment in the broad field of labor economics. The Committee recog-nizes that the Nation requires current, accurate, detailed workforce statistics for Federal and non-Federal data users as provided by BLS. The Committee urges BLS to take steps to improve information it collects and reports related to education occupations in career and technical fields. This should include expanded sample size, sur-vey question refinement, and enhanced analytical capacity for the annual supplement to the Current Population Survey [CPS], so it produces better information about occupational credentials. The Committee requests BLS to provide a report not later than 90 days after enactment of this act on the cost and design options for a new survey on employer-provided training. O FFICE OF DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT POLICY Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $38,203,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 27,203,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 38,203,000 The Committee recommends $38,203,000, the same as fiscal year 2017, for the Office of Disability Employment Policy to provide leadership, develop policy and initiatives, and award grants fur-thering the objective of eliminating physical and programmatic bar-riers to the training and employment of people with disabilities and to design and implement research and technical assistance grants and contracts to develop policy that reduces barriers to competitive, integrated employment for youth and adults with disabilities. D EPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $334,844,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 259,858,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 336,844,000 The Committee recommendation includes $336,844,000 for the Departmental Management account. Of this amount, $336,536,000 is available from general funds and $308,000 is available by trans-fer from the Employment Security account of the Unemployment Trust Fund. In addition, $30,595,000 is available by transfer from the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The Departmental Management appropriation pays the salaries and related expenses of staff responsible for formulating and over-seeing the implementation of departmental policy and management activities in support of that goal. In addition, this appropriation in-cludes a variety of operating programs and activities that are not involved in departmental management functions, but for which other appropriations for salaries and expenses are not suitable. The Committee recommendation includes $86,125,000 for the Bu- reau of International Labor Affairs [ILAB], of which $59,825,000 is available for obligation through December 31, 2018. ILAB's appro-37 priation is available to help improve working conditions and labor standards for workers around the world by carrying out ILAB's statutory mandates and international responsibilities including in promoting the elimination of child labor and forced labor. ILAB will continue to oversee 61 active grant projects totaling over $316,000,000 in 67 countries around the world in fiscal year 2018 in addition to new grants appropriated in fiscal year 2017 which have not yet been awarded. ILAB will also continue to publish its annual List of Goods Pro- duced by Child or Forced Labor that helps to identify global sectors where human trafficking has occurred. Funding for international programming to eliminate the worst forms of child labor should prioritize comprehensive and sustainable initiatives that address the root causes of the problem, including lack of education and vo-cational training opportunities; household poverty; lack of data and awareness of the scope and impact of the worst forms of child labor; gaps in social protection services; and weak enforcement of labor laws, which increase the vulnerability of households to the worst forms of child labor. ILAB plays an important role in identi-fying and addressing labor violations in U.S. trade agreements, and its work leads to greater worker rights and protections globally, which helps to ensure that U.S. workers compete on a level playing field. The Committee recommendation provides $8,040,000 for program evaluation and allows these funds to be available for obligation through September 30, 2019. The Committee bill also continues the authority of the Secretary to transfer these funds to any other ac-count in the Department for evaluation purposes. The Committee bill continues authority to use up to 0.75 percent of certain Depart-ment appropriations for evaluation activities identified by the chief evaluation officer. The Committee expects to be notified of the planned uses of funds derived from this authority. The recommendation includes $23,534,000 for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management. The re-duction reflects the transfer of the Departmental Budget Center to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer as requested.

The Committee continues bill language allowing the Bureau to award grants. VETERANS EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $279,041,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 279,595,000 Committee recommendation The Committee recommendation of $284,041,000 for the Vet- erans Employment and Training Service [VETS] includes $45,000,000 in general revenue funding and $239,041,000 to be ex-pended from the Employment Security Administration account of the Unemployment Trust Fund. This account provides resources for VETS to maximize employ- ment opportunities for veterans and transitioning service members, including protecting their employment rights. VETS carries out its 38 mission through a combination of grants to States, competitive grants, and Federal enforcement and oversight. The Committee provides $175,000,000 for the Jobs for Veterans State Grants [JVSG] program. This funding will enable Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program specialists and Local Veterans' Em-ployment Representatives to continue providing intensive employ-ment services to veterans and eligible spouses; transitioning service members early in their separation from military service; wounded warriors recuperating in military treatment facilities or transition units; and, spouses and family caregivers to help ensure the family has income to provide sufficient support. The Committee maintains language providing authority for JVSG funding to be used for data systems and contract support to allow for the tracking of partici-pant and performance information. The Committee provides $18,500,000 for the Transition Assist- ance Program [TAP], an increase of $3,900,000 over fiscal year 2017 to support employment workshops at military installations and in virtual classrooms worldwide for exiting service members and spouses. The Committee recommendation includes $42,127,000 for Federal administration costs. This funding level will support oversight and administration of the VETS grant programs, TAP employment workshops, and compliance and enforcement activities. The Committee recommends $45,000,000 for the Homeless Vet- erans' Reintegration Program [HVRP], level with fiscal year 2017, to help homeless veterans attain the skills they need to gain mean-ingful employment. This funding will allow DOL to provide HVRP services to over 18,000 homeless veterans nationwide, including homeless women veterans. The bill allows Incarcerated Veterans' Transition funds to be awarded through September 30, 2018, and to serve veterans who have recently been released from incarcer-ation but are at-risk of homelessness. The Committee recommendation includes $3,414,000 for the Na- tional Veterans' Training Institute, which provides training to Fed-eral staff and veteran service providers. The Committee includes funding and new authority to facilitate the Department's imple-mentation of the Honoring Investments in Recruiting and Employ-ing American Military Veterans Act of 2017. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $18,778,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 29,722,000 Committee recommendation The Committee recommends $18,778,000 for the IT Moderniza- tion account. Funds available in this account have been used for two primary activities. The first is departmental support systems, for which $4,898,000 is provided as requested. The second activity, IT Infrastructure Modernization, supports necessary activities asso-ciated with the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative. OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $87,721,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 86,136,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 87,721,000 39 The Committee recommends $87,721,000 for the DOL OIG. The bill includes $82,061,000 in general funds and authority to transfer $5,660,000 from the Employment Security Administration account of the Unemployment Trust Fund. In addition, an amount of $330,000 is available by transfer from the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Through a comprehensive program of audits, investigations, in- spections, and program evaluations, OIG attempts to reduce the in-cidence of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, and to pro-mote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. The Department has reported improper payments, including fraud, in the UI and Employee Compensation programs totaling ap-proximately $3,850,000,000 and $106,300,000 respectively for fiscal year 2016. The Committee strongly supports and commends the ef-forts of the OIG to identify and prosecute those who defraud the Department's worker benefit programs and to help protect the sol-vency of these important programs. The Committee is disturbed by reports that a DOL whistleblower charged that DOL's Division of Energy Employees Compensation Program sought to thwart workers' attempts to seek compensation. Outside groups also have raised concerns about implementation of the program. Therefore, the Office of Inspector General shall con-duct a comprehensive review of DOL's Division of Energy Employ-ees Compensation Program [DEEOIC] to determine the impact of policy changes in the past two years under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act [EEOICPA] on workers and the fulfilling of the program's statutory mission.

(41) TITLE II DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Any references in this title of the report to the ''Secretary'' or the ''Department'' shall be interpreted to mean the Secretary of HHS or the Department of HHS, respectively, unless otherwise noted. H EALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION HRSA activities support programs to provide healthcare services for mothers and infants; the underserved, elderly, and homeless; rural residents; and disadvantaged minorities. This agency sup-ports cooperative programs in maternal and child health, AIDS care, healthcare provider training, and healthcare delivery systems and facilities. BUREAU OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,491,522,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 1,488,687,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,491,522,000 The Committee recommendation for the activities of the Bureau of Primary Health Care is $1,491,522,000. Community Health Centers The Committee provides $1,491,522,000 in this bill for Commu- nity Health Centers, equal to the amount provided last year. Programs supported by this funding include community health centers, migrant health centers, healthcare for the homeless, school-based, and public housing health service grants. The Com-mittee continues to support the ongoing effort to increase the num-ber of people who have access to medical services at health centers. Health centers play a vital role in ensuring access to primary care in underserved areas of the country, including urban, rural, and frontier areas. The Committee is supportive of ongoing efforts to expand the ca- pacity of community health centers to offer a comprehensive, inte-grated range of services, through strategic investment in behav-ioral health, substance abuse, oral health, and other services and capacity. The Committee also recognizes the need for capital re-sources at community health centers to meet increased demand and upgrade facilities. The Committee believes that enhanced funding for the technical assistance and networking functions available for health centers through national and State cooperative agreements and grants is critical to the successful operation and expansion of the health cen-ters program. Funds are available within the amount provided to enhance technical assistance and training activities, further quality improvement initiatives, and continue the development of and sup-42 port for health center-controlled networks so that new and existing centers can improve patient access to quality health services. In addition, within the amount provided, the Committee provides up to $99,893,000 under the Federal Tort Claims Act [FTCA], available until expended. These funds are used to pay judgments and settlements, occasional witness fees and expenses, and related administrative costs. The Committee intends FTCA coverage fund-ed through this bill to be inclusive of all providers, activities, and services included within the health centers' federally approved scope of project. Native Hawaiian Health Care. \u2014The Committee expects that no less than $14,400,000 be provided for the Native Hawaiian Health Care Program. Perinatal Transmission of Hepatitis B .\u2014The Committee appre- ciates that HRSA has agreed to fund an evaluation of intervention strategies to eliminate the perinatal transmission of Hepatitis B. This is consistent with the urgings of the Committee for the last four fiscal years. The Committee recognizes that a full evaluation of intervention strategies will require the training of health care professionals, followed by service delivery, and data collection. The Committee directs that HRSA's funding plans accommodate these components and this necessary sequence of activities in order to ac-commodate a full evaluation of the recommended intervention strategies. Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Coverage The Committee provides $1,000,000 for payments of claims under the FTCA to be made available for free clinic health professionals as authorized by section 224(o) of the PHS Act. This appropriation extends FTCA coverage to medical volunteers in free clinics to expand access to healthcare services to low-income individuals in medically underserved areas. BUREAU OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $838,695,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 382,631,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 856,195,000 The Committee recommendation for the activities of the Bureau of Health Professions is $856,195,000. The Bureau of Health Professions provides policy leadership and grant support for health professions workforce development. The mission of the Bureau is to identify shortage areas while working to make them obsolete. Its programs are intended to ensure that the Nation has the right clinicians, with the right skills, working where they are needed. National Health Service Corps The Committee recommendation does not include discretionary funding for the National Health Service Corps [Corps]. The Com-mittee strongly supports the Corps' long and successful record of supporting qualified healthcare providers that are dedicated to working in underserved areas with limited access to healthcare. Nearly 3-in-4 Corps members choose to stay in the area in which they serve upon completion of their service, and it is essential to 43 ensure that the Committee is supporting the creation and develop- ment of health care professionals in rural areas. The Committee recognizes that the Corps is an essential tool for recruitment and retention of health professionals at community health centers, especially given recent expansions of the program. The Committee encourages HRSA to increase the proportion of cli-nicians serving at health centers to improve alignment between these two programs and to best leverage investments in Corps health professionals. The Committee recognizes that the Secretary retains the authority to include additional disciplines in the Corps. As such, the Committee urges the Secretary to include pharmacists and pediatric subspecialists as eligible recipients of scholarships and loan repayments through the program. The Committee recognizes the importance of the Corps scholar- ship and loan-repayment programs with Corps members in all 50 States. The Committee encourages HRSA to ensure that States with fewer than ten Corps awardees in the most recent fiscal year, will receive at least five awards in that State this fiscal year, prioritizing awards to individuals for whom that is their home State or to those that received their education in that State. The Committee continues to include section 206 of this act to modify the rules governing the Corps to allow every Corps member 60 days to cancel their contract. Training for Diversity Minorities in Health Professions .\u2014The Committee understands that there is a concern about the supply of underrepresented mi-norities [URM] in health professions. The Committee supports more attention be focused on ways to better address URM in areas such as pharmacy, medicine, and behavioral health and encourages HRSA to emphasize the importance of adequate industrial training space with better secured/controlled access, bacteria free environ-ment and temperature/humidity control as a means to enhance the academic performance, support faculty development and facilitate research. Centers of Excellence The Committee recommends $21,711,000 for the Centers of Ex- cellence [COE] Program. The Committee recognizes that the COE Program increases the supply and competencies of URM in health professions. Funds sup-port programs of excellence that enhance the academic performance of URM students, support URM faculty development, and facilitate research on minority health issues. Health Careers Opportunity Program The Committee provides $14,189,000 for the Health Careers Op- portunity Program. This program provides individuals from dis-advantaged backgrounds who desire to pursue a health professions career an opportunity to develop the skills needed to successfully compete for, enter, and graduate from schools of health professions or allied health professions. 44 Faculty Loan Repayment The Committee provides $1,190,000 for the Faculty Loan Repay- ment Program. This amount is the same as the fiscal year 2017 en-acted level. Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students The Committee provides $45,970,000 for Scholarships for Dis- advantaged Students, equal to the fiscal year 2017 level. The Com-mittee supports diversity among health professionals. This program provides grants to eligible health professions and nursing schools to award scholarships to students from disadvantaged backgrounds who have financial need. Primary Care Training and Enhancement The Committee provides $38,924,000 for Primary Care Training and Enhancement programs, which support the expansion of train-ing in internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, and physician assistance. Funds may be used for developing training programs or providing direct financial assistance to students and residents. Training in Oral Health Care The Committee provides $36,673,000 for Training in Oral Health Care programs, which includes not less than $10,000,000 each for general and pediatric dentistry. Funds may be used to expand training in general dentistry, pediatric dentistry, public health den-tistry, dental hygiene, and other oral health access programs. Funds may also be used to plan and operate training programs, as well as to provide financial assistance to students and residents. The Committee is pleased that HRSA has restored the position of Chief Dental Office [CDO] and looks forward to learning how the agency has ensured that the CDO is functioning at an executive level authority with resources to oversee and lead HRSA oral health programs and initiatives. The Committee directs HRSA to provide an update on how the CDO is serving as the agency rep-resentative on oral health issues to international, national, State, and local government agencies, universities, and oral health stake-holder organizations in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. The Nation continues to confront an oral health access crisis, which will not be ameliorated without better utilization of existing dental providers and exploration of new types of licensed dental providers. The Committee urges HRSA to convene a stakeholder meeting in order to determine how best to create new entry points into the oral health care delivery system for rural and other under-served populations, better utilization of existing dental personnel, and exploration of new types of dental providers. The agency is directed to provide continuation funding for predoctoral and postdoctoral training grants initially awarded in fiscal year 2015, and for Section 748 Dental Faculty Loan Program grants initially awarded in fiscal year 2016 with preference for pe-diatric dentistry faculty supervising dental students or residents and providing clinical services in dental clinics located in dental schools, hospitals, and community-based affiliated sites. The Committee continues long-standing bill language that pro- hibits funding for section 340G-1 of the PHS Act. 45 Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Linkages Area Health Education Centers The Committee provides $32,750,000, an increase of $2,500,000 for Area Health Education Centers [AHEC]. The Committee does not support the administration's proposed elimination of AHEC funding. The program links university health science centers with commu- nity health service delivery systems to provide training sites for students, faculty, and practitioners. The program supports three types of projects: core grants to plan and implement programs; spe-cial initiative funding for schools that have previously received AHEC grants; and model programs to extend AHEC programs with 50 percent Federal funding. The AHEC community training model provides a uniquely appropriate opportunity to bring the training of community health workers to scale. HRSA is encouraged to pro-vide technical assistance on and disseminate best practices for training community health workers to existing AHECs. The Com-mittee is pleased with AHEC's efforts to improve access to quality healthcare in America's rural and underserved areas by increasing the number of primary healthcare professionals who practice in those areas. Geriatric Programs The Committee provides $38,737,000 for Geriatric Programs. The Committee recognizes the importance of geriatric training programs incorporating culturally sensitive training programs and encourages HRSA to work to ensure training programs are collabo-rative, interdisciplinary, and culturally competent. Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training Pro- gram The Committee provides $50,000,000 for Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training Program [BHWET]. The BHWET Program is focused on developing and expanding the men-tal health and substance abuse workforce serving populations across the lifespan. HRSA will continue to leverage SAMHSA's sub-ject matter expertise in formatting new investments in fiscal year 2018. The Committee supports the broadened target populations of people to be served by the BHWET program. The Committee con-tinues to direct that eligible entities for this program shall include, but is not limited to, accredited programs that train masters and clinical doctoral level social workers, psychologists, counselors, marriage and family therapists, psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners, occupational therapists; psychology interns; and be-havioral health paraprofessionals. Mental and Behavioral Health Education Training Programs The Committee provides $9,916,000 for Mental and Behavioral Health Education Training Programs. The programs provide grants to higher education institutions and accredited training programs to recruit and train professionals and faculty in the fields of social work, psychology, psychiatry, marriage and family therapy, sub-46 stance abuse prevention and treatment, and other areas of mental and behavioral health. Graduate Psychology Education Program [GPE] .\u2014The Com- mittee recognizes the growing need for highly trained behavioral health professionals to deliver evidence-based services to vulner-able populations, including the elderly, returning military veterans, and those suffering from trauma. The GPE program is the main Federal initiative dedicated to the education and training of psy-chologists. The Committee urges HRSA to explore evidence-based approaches to leverage workforce capacity through this program, to invest in geropsychology training programs, and to help integrate health service psychology trainees at Federally Qualified Health Centers. Screening and Treatment for Maternal Depression The Committee provides $5,000,000 for a new Screening and Treatment for Maternal Depression program as authorized in Sec-tion 10005 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law 114-255). HRSA is directed to make grants to States to establish, improve, or maintain programs to train professionals to screen, assess, and treat for maternal depression in women who are pregnant or who have given birth within the preceding 12 months. Health Professions Workforce Information and Analysis The Committee provides $4,663,000 for health professions work- force information and analysis. The program provides for the collec-tion and analysis of targeted information on the Nation's healthcare workforce, research on high-priority workforce ques-tions, the development of analytic and research infrastructure, and program evaluation and assessment. Public Health Workforce Development The Committee provides $17,000,000 for Public Health Workforce Development. This program line, also called Public Health and Pre-ventive Medicine, funds programs that are authorized in titles III and VII of the PHS Act and support awards to schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, public health, and integrative medicine pro-grams. Nursing Workforce Development Programs The Committee provides $234,472,000 for Nursing Workforce De- velopment programs. These programs provide funding to address all aspects of nursing workforce demand, including education, prac-tice, recruitment, and retention. Advanced Education Nursing The Committee recommends $69,581,000 for the Advanced Edu- cation Nursing programs, which increases the number of qualified nurses in the workforce by improving nursing education through curriculum and faculty development. The Committee notes that in 2015, approximately 400,000 indi- viduals age 12 or older were reported victims of sexual assault ac-cording to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Studies have shown that exams performed by sexual assault forensic examiners\u2014med-47 ical providers trained in collecting and preserving forensic evi- dence\u2014may result in better physical and mental health care for victims, better evidence collection, and higher prosecution rates. The Committee is concerned that a recent GAO report identified major gaps in access to sexual assault examinations at hospitals nationwide, including a lack of trained sexual assault nurse exam-iners, or SANEs, whose job is to provide uninterrupted compas-sionate care and to collect the evidence critical to successful pros-ecutions. As such, the Committee provides an increase of $5,000,000 to award grants for the clinical training of sexual as-sault nurse examiners to administer medical forensic examinations and treatments to victims of sexual assault in hospitals, health centers, and other emergency health care service provider settings, including Federally qualified health centers, clinics receiving fund-ing under title X, and other health care providers as determined appropriate by the Secretary. Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education The Committee provides $305,000,000, an increase of $5,000,000, for the Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education [CHGME] program. The Committee strongly supports the CHGME program which provides support for graduate medical education training programs in both ambulatory and in-patient settings within free-standing children's teaching hospitals. CHGME payments are de-termined by a per-resident formula that includes an amount for di-rect training costs added to a payment for indirect costs. Payments support training of resident physicians as defined by Medicare in both ambulatory and inpatient settings. The Committee recognizes changes made to the program that have increased the number of children's teaching hospitals eligible to apply for funding. The Committee notes the Secretary's use of the authority provided under the current authorization to make funding available for hospitals previously ineligible for the pro-gram, and urges the Secretary to continue to make such funding available in future CHGME application and funding cycles. The Committee encourages HRSA to continue its work with the Chil-dren's Hospitals on the development and collection of enhanced program performance measures. National Practitioner Data Bank The Committee provides $18,814,000 for the National Practi- tioner Data Bank. As mandated by the Health Care Quality Im-provement Act, the National Practitioner Data Bank does not re-ceive appropriated funds, but instead is financed by the collection of user fees. The National Practitioner Data Bank collects certain adverse in- formation, medical malpractice payment history, and information related to healthcare fraud and abuse. The data bank is open to healthcare agencies and organizations that make licensing and em-ployment decisions. 48 MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $848,617,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 795,290,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 848,617,000 The Committee recommendation for the Maternal and Child Health [MCH] Bureau is $848,617,000. The mission of the Bureau is to improve the physical and mental health, safety, and well- being of the Nation's women, infants, children, adolescents, and their families. This population includes fathers and children with special healthcare needs. Virtual Pediatric Trauma Center .\u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of a Virtual Pediatric Trauma Center, which would pro-vide 24/7 virtual access to critical pediatric acute trauma care re-sources for providers in the United States and around the world, for civilian and military purposes. When trauma strikes a child, most of them will receive care from a surgeon, physician, nurse, or physician-extender with limited pediatric trauma experience or be distant from necessary, pediatric subspecialties such as pediatric surgery. The Committee acknowledges the work that HRSA has undertaken with the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences to cooperatively introduce and develop the concept of a Virtual Pediatric Trauma Center. Recognizing the value of the con-cept and the established conceptual framework, the Committee re-quests that HRSA provide an update on the status of the Virtual Pediatric Trauma Center model in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Maternal and Child Health Block Grant The Committee provides $641,700,000 for the MCH Block Grant, which provides a flexible source of funding that allows States to target their most urgent maternal and child health needs. The pro-gram supports a broad range of activities including: providing pre-natal care, well child services, and immunizations; reducing infant mortality; preventing injury and violence; expanding access to oral healthcare; addressing racial and ethnic disparities; and providing comprehensive care through clinics, home visits, and school-based health programs. Children's Health and Development. \u2014Evidence shows that expe- riences in early childhood have long-term health consequences over the course of a person's life. These experiences are critical for a child's educational, social, physical, and economic well-being. Chil-dren living in States with persistently high child poverty rates ex-perience more negative health outcomes than their peers else- where. Therefore, the Committee provides $3,500,000 within the Special Projects of Regional and National Significance program for the HRSA-funded study focused on improving child health through a statewide system of early childhood developmental screenings and interventions. This funding shall be used to extend the cur-rently-funded project for another year. Maternal Mortality .\u2014The Committee is aware that many women in the United States suffer from maternal morbidity and the ma-ternal mortality rate in the United States has more than doubled between 1987 and 2013. The Committee directs the Maternal and Child Health Bureau to submit a report to the Committee, no later 49 than 180 days after the enactment of this act, on recommendations to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates in the United States. The report should include information and insights from States gathered through the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health program and other sources. Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program.\u2014 The Committee encourages HRSA and the Administration for Chil-dren and Families to continue their collaboration and partnerships to improve health and development outcomes for at-risk pregnant women, parents, and young children through evidence-based home visiting programs. Sickle Cell Anemia The Committee provides $4,455,000 for grants and contracts to help coordinate service delivery for individuals with sickle cell dis-ease, including genetic counseling and testing; training of health professionals; and coordination of education, treatment, and con-tinuity of care programs. Autism and Other Developmental Disorders The Committee provides $47,099,000 for the Autism and Other Developmental Disorders program. The program supports surveil-lance, early detection, education, and intervention activities on au-tism and other developmental disorders, as authorized in the Com-bating Autism Act of 2006. Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Dis- abilities [LEND] Programs .\u2014The Committee provides $28,990,000 for the LEND program to maintain capacity and expand the num-ber of sites to train professionals to diagnose, treat, and provide interventions to individuals with autism spectrum disorder author-ized by the Combating Autism Act. This funding will help these programs initiate or expand their work in the area of interdiscipli-nary leadership training to meet the needs of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and related developmental disabilities. This funding will also enable the LEND network to assist in ongoing de-velopmental monitoring, especially for children exposed to lead and other environmental toxins and for infants exposed to the Zika virus with its resulting complications. In addition, the funding will allow these programs to develop innovative strategies to integrate and enhance existing investments, including translating research findings on interventions, guidelines, tools and systems manage-ment approaches to training settings, communities and into prac-tice; and promote life-course considerations, from developmental screening in early childhood to transition to adulthood issues. Newborn Screening for Heritable Disorders The Committee provides $13,883,000 for the Newborn Heritable Disorders Screening program, as described in section 1109 of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2008. This program provides funding to improve States' ability to provide newborn and child screening for heritable disorders. Newborn screening provides early identification and follow-up for treatment of infants affected by cer-tain genetic, metabolic, hormonal, and/or functional conditions. 50 Healthy Start The Committee provides $103,500,000 for the Healthy Start in- fant mortality initiative. The primary purpose of Healthy Start is to reduce infant mortality and generally improve maternal and in-fant health in at-risk communities. Grants are awarded to State and local health departments and nonprofit organizations to con-duct an infant mortality review, develop a package of innovative health and social services for pregnant women and infants, and evaluate these efforts. Universal Newborn Hearing Screening and Early Intervention The Committee provides $17,818,000 for universal newborn hear- ing screening and early intervention activities. This program awards grants to 53 States and territories that support Statewide systems of newborn hearing screening, audiologic diagnostic testing before 3 months of age, and enrollment in early intervention pro-grams before the age of 6 months. Emergency Medical Services for Children The Committee provides $20,162,000 for the Emergency Medical Services for Children program which focuses on improving the pe-diatric components of the emergency medical services system and improving the quality of care provided to children in the pre-hos-pital setting. Funding is available to every State emergency med-ical services office to improve the quality of emergency care for children and to pay for research and dissemination of best prac-tices. HIV/AIDS BUREAU Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. Committee recommendation 2,318,781,000 The Committee recommendation includes $2,318,781,000 for the HIV/AIDS Bureau. The mission of the Bureau is to address the unmet care and treatment needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS. The Bureau ad-ministers the Ryan White Care Act, which provides a wide range of community-based services, including primary and home healthcare, case management, substance abuse treatment, mental health, and nutritional services. Screening for Sexually Transmitted Diseases [STDs].\u2014The Com- mittee continues to support HRSA's efforts to include screening and treatment for all STDs as a part of the comprehensive clinical care provided to HIV infected individuals. The Committee encourages HRSA to continue to work with CDC's Division of STD Prevention to establish appropriate protocols and standards to assure that these screenings are fully integrated into grant recipients com-prehensive clinical care plan.

Funds are awarded to States to support HIV service delivery con- sortia, the provision of home- and community-based care services for individuals with HIV disease, continuation of health insurance coverage for low-income persons with HIV disease, and support for State AIDS drug assistance programs [ADAP]. The Committee pro-vides $900,313,000 for AIDS medications in ADAP. Early Intervention Services The Committee provides $201,079,000 for early intervention grants. These funds are awarded competitively to primary healthcare providers to enhance healthcare services available to people at risk of HIV and AIDS. Funds are used for comprehensive primary care, including counseling, testing, diagnostic, and thera-peutic services. Children, Youth, Women, and Families The Committee provides $75,088,000 for grants for coordinated services to women, infants, children, and youth. Funds are awarded to a variety of providers, including commu- nity health centers, comprehensive hemophilia centers, county and municipal health departments, and other nonprofit community- based programs that provide comprehensive primary healthcare services to populations with or at risk for HIV. AIDS Dental Services The Committee provides $13,122,000 for the AIDS Dental Serv- ices program. This program provides grants to dental schools, den-tal hygiene schools, and postdoctoral dental education programs to assist with the cost of providing unreimbursed oral healthcare to patients with HIV. The Ryan White Part F program provides for the Dental Reim- bursement Program [DRP] which covers the unreimbursed costs of providing dental care to persons living with HIV/AIDS. Programs qualifying for reimbursement are dental schools, hospitals with postdoctoral dental education programs, and colleges with dental hygiene programs. AIDS Education and Training Centers The Committee provides $33,611,000 for AIDS Education and Training Centers [AETCs]. AETCs train healthcare practitioners, faculty, and students who care for AIDS patients outside of the tra-ditional health professions education venues and support cur-riculum development on the diagnosis and treatment of HIV infec-tion for health professions schools and training organizations. 52 Special Projects of National Significance The Committee provides $25,000,000 for the Special Projects of National Significance program. This program supports the develop-ment, evaluation and dissemination of innovative models of HIV care to improve the retention and health outcomes of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program clients. HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $104,193,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 99,351,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 101,640,000 The Committee recommendation for the Health Care Systems Bureau is $101,640,000. The Health Care Systems Bureau protects the public health and improves the health of individuals through efforts to support and enhance the systems by which healthcare is delivered in America. Organ Donation and Transplantation The Committee provides $23,549,000 for organ donation and transplantation activities. Funds support a scientific registry of organ transplant recipients and the National Organ Procurement and Transplantation Net-work to match donors and potential recipients of organs. A portion of the appropriated funds may be used to educate the public and health professionals about organ donations and transplants and to support clearinghouse and technical assistance functions. Liver Transplant .\u2014The Committee understands that HRSA is considering a new proposal to address liver distribution by the end of the year. The Committee encourages UNOS and HRSA to pro-ceed carefully, taking into consideration all regional concerns and available analyses. The Committee directs HRSA, in consultation with UNOS, to submit a report the Committee no later than 180 days after enactment of this act on the following: costs to trans-plant programs and to liver recipients, transportation of livers, and health disparities, with a particular focus on its effects among vul-nerable populations. The report should examine whether these ef-fects vary due to a donor or patient's socioeconomic status or rural location. National Cord Blood Inventory The Committee provides $12,266,000 for the National Cord Blood Inventory. The purpose of this program is to provide funds to cord blood banks to build an inventory of the highest quality cord blood units for transplantation. C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program The Committee provides $22,109,000 for the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program. The Committee continues to support cell transplantation through the use of cord blood, bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, and other sources of stem cells that may be available in the future. The Committee appreciates HRSA's efforts to increase the diversity of the registry and the program's research efforts to improve the 53 availability, efficiency, safety, and cost of transplants and the effec- tiveness of program operations. Office of Pharmacy Affairs The Committee provides $10,238,000 for the Office of Pharmacy Affairs [OPA]. OPA administers the 340B drug pricing program, which requires drug manufacturers to provide discounts or rebates to a set of programs and hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The Committee is aware that the 340B statute requires HRSA to make 340B ceiling prices available to covered entities through a se-cure Web site and continues to be concerned that OPA has failed to meet deadlines to complete work on the secure Web site. The Committee urges OPA to complete the development of a trans-parent system to verify the accuracy of the 340B discount or ceiling prices. Poison Control Centers The Committee provides $19,846,000, an increase of $1,000,000 from fiscal year 2017, for poison control activities. The Poison Con-trol Centers [PCCs] program is a national network of 55 PCCs that prevent and treat poison exposures by providing cost effective, quality healthcare advice to the general public and healthcare pro- viders. The Committee continues to recognize the role PCCs have played in the opioid crisis through management of opioid overdoses by as-sisting first responders and hospital personnel through the Na-tional Poison Help Line. National Hansen's Disease Program The Committee includes $11,653,000 for the National Hansen's Disease program. The program consists of inpatient, outpatient, long-term care as well as training and research in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; a residential facility at Carville, Louisiana; and 11 out-patient clinic sites in the continental United States and Puerto Rico. The decrease in this account below the fiscal year 2017 level reflects a declining beneficiary population. National Hansen's Disease Program Buildings and Facilities The Committee provides $122,000 for the repair and mainte- nance of buildings at the Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center. Payment to Hawaii for Hansen's Disease Treatment The Committee provides $1,857,000 to Hawaii for Hansen's Dis- ease treatment. Payments are made to the State of Hawaii for the medical care and treatment of persons with Hansen's disease in hospital and clinic facilities at Kalaupapa, Molokai, and Honolulu. Expenses above the level of appropriated funds are borne by the State of Hawaii. RURAL HEALTH Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $156,060,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 74,395,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 160,560,000 54 The Committee recommendation for Rural Health programs is $160,560,000, an increase of $4,500,000 above the fiscal year 2017 level. The Office of Rural Health Policy [ORHP] administers HHS rural health programs, coordinates activities related to rural healthcare within HHS, and analyzes the possible effects of policy on the more than 42 million residents of rural communities. ORHP advises the Secretary on the effects of Medicare and Medicaid on rural citizens' access to care, the viability of rural hospitals, and the availability of physicians and other health professionals. Rural Health Outreach The Committee provides $67,500,000 for the Rural Health Out- reach program, $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2017 level. This program supports projects that demonstrate new and inno- vative modes of outreach in rural areas, such as integration and co-ordination of health services. The Committee recommendation pro-vides not more than $12,514,000 for Outreach Service Grants; not more than $15,000,000 for Rural Network Development Grants; not less than $14,000,000 for Delta States Network Grant Program; not more than $2,200,000 for Network Planning Grants; and not less than $6,500,000 for Small Healthcare Provider Quality Improve-ment Grants. Delta States Rural Development Network Grant Program. \u2014The Committee encourages HRSA to continue to consult with the Delta Regional Authority [DRA] on the awarding, implementing, admin-istering, and monitoring grants under the Delta States Network Grant Program in fiscal year 2018. The Committee continues to en-courage HRSA to align its awards as closely as possible with the DRA's strategic plan and with DRA economic and community de-velopment plans. In addition, of the funds provided, the Committee provides $4,000,000 to support HRSA's collaboration with the DRA to continue DRA's program to help underserved rural communities identify and better address their health care needs and to help small rural hospitals improve their financial and operational per-formance. Finally, the Committee encourages HRSA to participate and collaborate on DRA's Next Health strategic plan for the Delta Region. The Committee believes that the information the DRA col-lects in the development of that plan will be of substantial value to HRSA, and encourages HRSA to provide support to DRA for the provision of that information. Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Committee directs HRSA and DRA to jointly brief the Committee on this program's progress. Expanding Capacity for Health Outcomes .\u2014The Committee notes the passage of Public Law 114-270 supporting Project ECHO and the efforts to deliver high-quality, professional care to rural and underserved communities. The Committee notes there is increasing demand for technical training on Project ECHO and encourages HRSA to support a national resource center focused on Project ECHO technical training. Rural Health Research The Committee provides $9,351,000 for the Rural Health Re- search program. Funds are used for rural health research centers, 55 the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health, and a reference and information service. Supported activities focus on improving the delivery of health services to rural communities and popu-lations. Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants The Committee provides $43,609,000 for Rural Hospital Flexi- bility grants and the Small Hospital Improvement Program. Under these grant programs, HRSA works with States to provide support and technical assistance to critical access hospitals to focus on quality and performance improvement and to integrate emergency medical services. The Committee continues to recognize the importance of sup- porting hospitals located in rural or underserved communities and recommends HRSA give preference in grant awards to Critical Ac-cess Hospitals serving rural communities that create community health teams to better coordinate care among rural populations to create better outcomes in chronic disease management. State Offices of Rural Health The Committee provides $10,000,000 for State Offices of Rural Health. These offices help States strengthen rural healthcare deliv-ery systems by enabling them to coordinate care and improve sup-port and outreach in rural areas. Black Lung Clinics The Committee provides $7,266,000 for the Black Lung Clinics program. This program funds clinics that treat respiratory and pul-monary diseases of active and retired coal miners, steel mill work-ers, agricultural workers, and others with occupationally related respiratory and pulmonary impairments. These clinics reduce the incidence of high-cost inpatient treatment for these conditions. The Committee continues to direct the Secretary to evaluate funding levels for applicants based on the needs of the populations those applicants will serve and the ability of those applicants to provide health care services to miners with respiratory illnesses, with preference given to State agency applications over other appli-cants in that State, without regard to the funding tiers and overall per-applicant funding cap established by the Secretary in fiscal year 2014. Radiation and Exposure Screening and Education Program The Committee provides $1,834,000 for activities authorized by the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. This program provides grants for the education, prevention, and early detection of radiogenic cancers and diseases resulting from exposure to ura-nium during mining and milling at nuclear test sites. Telehealth The Committee provides $21,000,000, an increase of $2,500,000 above the fiscal year 2017 level, for the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth [OAT], which promotes the effective use of tech-nologies to improve access to health services for people who are iso-56 lated from healthcare and to provide distance education for health professionals. The Committee strongly supports OAT and their mission to ex- pand high quality medical care to rural communities that do not have adequate access to medical providers including many medical specialties. Telehealth Center of Excellence [COE] .\u2014The Committee com- mends HRSA's OAT for providing the requested report to Congress and for awarding the Telehealth COE grant during fiscal year 2017. Within the funds provided for OAT activities, the Committee includes $4,000,000 for a second year of funding for the Telehealth COE awarded site. This site is responsible for testing the efficacy of telehealth services in various sites and models, providing re-search and coordination efforts across the Federal Government, de-veloping best practices for telehealth, collecting data, and providing relevant telehealth training. Telehealth Network Grant Program .\u2014The Committee remains encouraged by the ability of telehealth services to provide access to vital care for patients in underserved areas. One very promising area for the expansion of telemedicine is in stroke treatment, where patients without access to specialty neurological care can significantly improve their standard of care through telehealth. Stroke is a leading cause of death but remains the major cause of long-term disability, and the speedy access to appropriate care is the key factor in determining patient mortality and recovery. The Committee encourages HRSA to support telestroke initiatives in the Telehealth Network Grant Program. Telehealth Resource Centers Grant Program .\u2014The Committee recognizes the vital role of existing Telehealth Resource Centers across the United States to provide support to healthcare organiza-tions, providers, and networks. In addition, these current centers are an important part of the telehealth infrastructure; helping to improve access to healthcare and ultimately improve outcomes for underserved populations. The Committee recommends that part of OAT funding should be used to support increased outreach to pro-viders and communities regarding the benefits of telehealth and the availability of technical assistance to support its further adop-tion. The Committee supports continued funding of the current 12 regional centers and two National centers in fiscal year 2018. FAMILY PLANNING Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $286,479,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 286,479,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 286,479,000 The Committee provides $286,479,000 for the title X Family Planning program. This program supports preventive and primary healthcare services at clinics nationwide. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $154,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 151,993,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 154,000,000 The Committee provides $154,000,000 for program management activities. 57 VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM TRUST FUND Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $247,750,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 277,200,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 247,750,000 The Committee provides that $247,750,000 be released from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund in fiscal year 2018. Of that amount, $7,750,000 is for administrative costs. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation program provides compensation for individuals with vaccine-associated injuries or deaths. Funds are awarded to reimburse medical expenses, lost earnings, pain and suffering, legal expenses, and death benefits. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund is funded by excise taxes on certain childhood vaccines. C ENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION The Committee recommendation provides a program level of $7,175,211,000 in this bill for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], which includes $55,358,000 in mandatory funds under the terms of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act [EEOICPA], and $800,900,000 in trans-fers from the Prevention and Public Health [PPH] Fund. The activities of CDC focus on several major priorities: providing core public health functions; responding to urgent health threats; monitoring the Nation's health using sound scientific methods; as-suring the Nation's preparedness for emerging infectious diseases and potential pandemics; and providing leadership in the imple-mentation of nationwide prevention strategies that are conducive to improving and maintaining health. IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $794,350,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 700,828,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 794,350,000 The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases is $794,350,000, which includes $324,350,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. The mission of the National Center for Immunization and Res- piratory Diseases is the prevention of disease, disability, and death through immunization and by control of respiratory and related diseases. The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol- lowing activities in the following amounts: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Section 317 Immunization Program .............................................. 606,792 180,000 187,558 Cost Estimates. \u2014The Committee looks forward to reviewing the fiscal year 2018 report on estimated funding needs of the Section 58 317 Immunization Program and requests that the report be up- dated and submitted not later than February 1, 2018, to reflect fis-cal year 2019 cost estimates. The updated report should also in-clude an estimate of optimum State and local operations funding, as well as a discussion of the evolving role of the 317 program as expanded coverage for vaccination becomes available from private and public sources over the next several years. Immunizations. \u2014The Committee does not support the proposed reduction to the Section 317 Immunization Program by the Admin-istration and provides funding at last year's level. The Committee believes a strong public health immunization infrastructure is crit-ical for ensuring high vaccination coverage levels, preventing vac-cine-preventable diseases, and responding to outbreaks. The Com-mittee acknowledges that immunization program investments in Immunization Information Systems [IIS] improve data exchange security standards and enhance the interface with electronic health records [EHRs] and other health information technology systems. IISs inform providers and support clinical decision making in terms of a patient's immunization status as well as help to identify rec-ommended vaccines the patient may not have received, which guide public health strategies to reduce vaccine-preventable diseases. During the 2015 multi-State measles outbreak and the ongoing, multi-State mumps outbreaks, funds from this program supported State and local health departments in rapid response, public health communication, community outreach and education, data gath-ering, and laboratory testing. HIV, VIRAL HEPATITIS , SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES , AND TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,117,278,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 934,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,117,278,000 The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Diseases [STDs], and TB Prevention is $1,117,278,000. The Center administers on HIV/AIDS, viral hep- atitis, STDs, and TB, with the exception of the Global AIDS pro-gram, which is housed in the Center on Global Health. The Committee recommends funding for the following activities in the following amounts: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Domestic HIV/AIDS Prevention and Research ................................ 788,712 640,065 Surveillance Effectiveness ........................ 152,310 130,000 Tuberculosis ................................................................................... 142,256 130,000 142,256 59 Hepatitis B. \u2014The Committee is concerned that even with a Hep- atitis B vaccine that is 95 percent effective, CDC estimates that there are at least 850,000 Americans infected with Hepatitis B, with an estimated 21,900 infections occurring in 2015. The Com-mittee notes that as a result of the opioid epidemic, infections are on the rise, with significant spikes in those areas that suffer from widespread opioid abuse. Additionally, the Committee highlights that the link between hepatitis B infection and primary liver can-cer is well established with up to 15 percent of liver cancer cases in the United States caused by HBV. Many of these liver cancer cases are preventable with early detection, treatment, and vaccina-tion. The Committee encourages CDC to prioritize the acceleration of Hepatitis B interventions within its Viral Hepatitis program commensurate with its disease burden. Hepatitis C.\u2014 The Committee recognizes the rising rates of hepa- titis C virus [HCV] infection among American Indians [AI] and Alaska Natives [AN], which surpasses many other populations. The Committee encourages CDC to work in collaboration with the In-dian Health Service to support increased prevention, HCV screen-ing, and access to treatment for AI and AN tribes. HIV Screening .\u2014The Committee continues to support CDC grant programs that work to improve awareness of HIV status and link-age to care. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on CDC action to improve testing rates and reduce late stage diagnosis in States that scored low on these measures of ef-fectiveness. Sexually Transmitted Infections [STIs].\u2014 The Committee encour- ages CDC to sustain public health infrastructure, support surveil-lance, and continue initiatives to address STI elimination with a special focus on congenital syphilis, gonorrhea disease reduction, and the use of technology to reach at-risk populations. Viral Hepatitis Screening. \u2014The Committee continues to support hepatitis screening activities and encourages CDC to prioritize screening programs in medically-underserved and minority commu-nities. Point-of-care testing allows for utilization of effective and in-novative screening technology in a variety of health care settings. EMERGING AND ZOONOTIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $584,922,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 514,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 584,922,000 The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases is $584,922,000, which includes $52,000,000 in transfers from PPH Fund. The National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Dis- eases aims to detect, prevent, and control infectious diseases from spreading, whether they are naturally occurring, unintentional, or the result of terrorism. The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol- lowing activities in the following amounts: 60 [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Core Infectious Diseases ............................................................... 396,350 379,684 396,350 Antibiotic Resistance Initiative ............................................. 163,000 137,000 Lab Safety and Quality ............................ 5,400 Emerging Infectious Diseases .............................................. Food Safety .................................................................................... 54,000 51,901 54,000 ............................................. 21,000 20,960 21,000 Quarantine ..................................................................................... 31,572 31,512 31,572 Advanced Molecular Detection ....................................................... 30,000 29,943 30,000 Epidemiology and Lab Capacity Program ..................................... 40,000 ............................ 40,000 Healthcare-Associated Infections .................................................. 12,000 ............................ hos- pital-acquired, catheter-associated urinary tract infections [CAUTIs] result in the death of 15,000 patients. When CDC's Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee last up-dated its guidelines for prevention of CAUTIs in 2009, it rec-ommended additional research on the use of urinary stents to re-duce infection. The Committee encourages CDC to examine existing evidence regarding the use of stents to address CAUTIs and issue appropriate communications to hospitals, up to and including an update to its 2009 Guidelines. Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria [CARB]. \u2014The Com- mittee continues to support the CARB initiative and provides $163,000,000 for this effort. The Committee recognizes the impor-tance of addressing antibiotic-resistant bacteria through a ''One Health'' approach, simultaneously combating antibiotic resistance in human, animal, and environmental settings. The Committee en-courages CDC to competitively award research activities that ad-dress aspects of antibiotic resistance related to ''One Health'' among entities, including public academic medical centers, veteri-nary schools with agricultural extension services, and State public health departments whose proposals are in line with CDC's strat-egy for addressing antibiotic resistant bacteria. CDC shall include an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Healthcare-Associated Infections [HAIs].\u2014 The Committee ac- knowledges CDC has made significant progress on HAIs prevention and data collection at acute-care hospitals, but gaps in data collec-tion and reporting on HAIs persist across outpatient, post-acute, and long-term care facilities. The Committee recognizes that vol-untary participation in the National Healthcare Safety Network continues to grow among dialysis facilities, nursing homes, and am-bulatory surgical centers, and encourages CDC to continue to ex-pand its data collection efforts to these healthcare providers. Lyme Disease and Related Tick-Borne Illnesses.\u2014 The Committee encourages CDC to support surveillance and prevention of Lyme disease and other high-consequence tick-borne diseases in endemic areas as well as areas not yet considered endemic. CDC should work closely with States to advance the use of Integrated Pest 61 Management for prevention and control of tick-borne diseases. The Committee encourages CDC to coordinate with NIH, NIMH, and NINDS on publishing reports that assess diagnostic advancements, methods for prevention, the state of treatment, and links between tick-borne disease and psychiatric illnesses. Further, the Com-mittee is concerned by reports that cases of Lyme disease are under-reported and encourages CDC to re-evaluate surveillance cri-teria used to track cases of the disease while assisting States to more accurately evaluate prevalence. The Committee requests a re-port within 180 days of enactment of this act on how CDC is exam-ining the potential misuse of the Lyme disease case definition. The report should also include updates on the implementation of the Lyme disease program, including advancing more sensitive diag-nostic tests and details of how Lyme disease funds were spent in fiscal year 2017. Responding to Emerging Threats. \u2014The Committee maintains funding for the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity [ELC] Infec-tious Diseases Program which strengthens the epidemiologic and laboratory capacity in 50 States, six local health departments, and eight territories. This funding provides critical support to epi-demiologists and laboratory scientists who are instrumental in dis-covering and responding to various food and vector-borne out-breaks. The Committee provides funding for ELC grants to sustain core surveillance capacity and ensure that State and local epi-demiologists are equipped to respond rapidly to emerging threats including antimicrobial resistant superbugs and the Zika virus. Sepsis.\u2014 The Committee is encouraged that CDC has addressed sepsis as a priority within the CARB initiative and has also im-proved its online sepsis awareness and prevention resources. The Committee supports CDC's goals to scale up the evaluation of sep-sis surveillance to help track national sepsis rates, assess the im-pact of prevention and treatment initiatives, and enable compari-sons between health care facilities to identify problem areas. In ad-dition, the Committee encourages CDC to continue to monitor the effectiveness of State-based sepsis prevention and treatment proto-cols. Urinary Tract Infections .\u2014The Committee notes that UTIs are one of the most common diagnoses leading to antibiotic prescrip-tions. Since recent research indicates that E. coli and other leading causes of UTIs are becoming resistant to many antibiotics, the Committee encourages CDC to examine the role that nutrient- dense food products, such as cranberries, may play in reducing the risk of illness and recurrent infections. The Committee also re-quests that CDC provide an update on this effort and actions to ad-dress antibiotic resistant pathogens linked to UTI in its fiscal year 2019 CJ. Vector-Borne Diseases.\u2014 The Committee requests a report 180 days after enactment of this act that details how CDC worked and is continuing to work with the States most vulnerable to Zika and other vector-borne diseases. Further, the Committee encourages CDC to provide a progress update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on meeting goals and performance indicators to prevent new infec-tions, improve health outcomes, and reduce disease-related dispari-ties. 62 Zika Virus .\u2014The Committee continues to support CDC's pre- paredness and response efforts to control outbreaks of Zika virus infection. The Committee encourages CDC to examine innovative vector control technologies to enhance current vector-borne disease control efforts. CDC should continue to work closely with the vector control unit in Puerto Rico and the most vulnerable States to ad-dress not only basic surveillance and research but also the use of new approaches to limit the spread of infected mosquitoes through innovative vector control technologies which can be effective in en- vironments and locations not amenable to traditional pesticides. CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,115,596,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 952,250,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,065,146,000 The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion is $1,065,146,000, which includes $247,550,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. The mission of the National Center for Chronic Disease Preven- tion is to provide national leadership in promoting health and well- being through prevention and control of chronic diseases. Nearly one-half of all American adults have at least one chronic illness; such diseases account for nearly 70 percent of all U.S. deaths and three-quarters of all healthcare costs in the United States. The Committee does not include the administration's proposal to create a new block grant and instead maintains the existing pro-gram line items, including funding mechanisms as they existed in fiscal year 2017. The Committee believes the existing funding structure allows for the greatest transparency, accountability, and measured outcomes for Congress and the taxpayer. Chronic dis-eases, such as arthritis, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and obesity are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and account for 86 cents of every dollar spent on health care. Therefore, a robust investment in the prevention and control of chronic diseases, including chronic conditions like Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, lupus, and colorectal, prostate, and skin cancers is essential to curb health spending and improve health and quality of life for millions of Americans. Within the total provided for the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the following amounts are available for the following categories of funding: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Tobacco .......................................................................................... 205,000 ...................... ......

Million Hearts Early Child Care Collaboratives 4,000 4,000 Hospitals Promoting Breastfeeding Alzheimer's and Healthy Aging. \u2014The Committee includes $3,500,000 for activities related to Alzheimer's disease and com-mends the Healthy Brain Initiative for its leadership in bringing attention to the public health crisis of Alzheimer's disease. The Committee encourages CDC to continue implementing the action steps listed in the updated Road Map, including working towards a consensus on the mortality burden of the disease. Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening.\u2014 The Committee encour- ages CDC to continue to strengthen access to preventive screenings for women who are uninsured or underinsured and at high risk for breast and cervical cancer through the Breast and Cervical Cancer program. Of women aged 21-64, 5,700,000 or 14.6 percent, will re-main eligible for cervical cancer screening through this program. Cancer Survivorship. \u2014Recognizing there are nearly 15 million cancer survivors in the United States, the Committee encourages CDC to invest in evidence-based physical activity and wellness pro-grams for cancer survivors. Evidence-based physical activity pro-grams have been shown to improve survivors' overall quality of life, increase cardiovascular endurance, decrease cancer-related fatigue, and help them meet or exceed recommended amounts of physical activity. Children in Adversity. \u2014The Committee recognizes that CDC is a key implementing partner of the United States Government Action Plan on Children in Adversity's three principle objectives. The 64 Committee fully supports the use of funds provided to CDC through this act for activities that the agency has identified as being necessary to link representative data to effective, sustain-able, and scalable action and thus ensure that: (1) the percentage of children achieving age-appropriate growth and developmental milestones is increased; (2) the percentage of children living outside of family care is reduced; and (3) the percentage of children experi-encing violence, exploitation, abuse, and neglect is reduced. The Committee continues to direct CDC to collaborate with USAID, PEPFAR, and the Department of Labor to ensure monitoring and evaluation is aligned for all of the Action Plan's objectives. The Committee asks that the annual Public Law 109-95 report to Con-gress display the amount of funding by objective to the Action Plan on Children in Adversity. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\u2014 The Committee applauds CDC's ef- forts to collaborate with disease experts in its multi-site study to resolve the case definition issues and urges CDC to complete that effort. The Committee encourages CDC to partner with other HHS agencies, disease experts, and key medical societies to implement a proactive dissemination plan that counters medical misinforma-tion and stigma and addresses other key barriers to clinical care. Chronic Pain. \u2014The Committee commends CDC for including chronic pain in the Healthy People 2020 initiative. The Committee encourages CDC to analyze data collected from the chronic pain questions included in the 2017 National Health Interview Survey and to clarify the incidence and prevalence of various pain syn-dromes differentiated by patient age, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, race, and gender. The Committee further encourages CDC to collect data on direct and indirect costs of pain treatment and effectiveness of evidence-based treatment approaches and include this information in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Diabetes Prevention Program. \u2014The Committee recommendation includes $22,500,000, level with fiscal year 2017, for the Diabetes Prevention Program. This program promoting lifestyle interven-tions has proven to reduce the risk of developing diabetes by 58 percent in individuals at high risk. Division of Diabetes Translation [DDT]. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes the work of CDC's DDT to address the diabetes epidemic and encourages CDC to continue to ensure that the prevention needs of those Americans with, and at risk for, diabetes and prediabetes are met. The Committee believes these activities must include clear outcomes and ensure transparency and accountability that dem-onstrate how funding was used to support diabetes prevention and specifically how diabetes funding reached State and local commu-nities. Additionally, the Committee encourages CDC to support the translation of research into better prevention, care, and surveil-lance. The Committee encourages CDC to explore opportunities to expand virtual delivery of the National Diabetes Prevention Pro-gram's lifestyle change program in rural areas where patients have provider care access challenges. Early Child Care Collaboratives .\u2014The Committee recognizes that the early care and education setting is important for pro-moting healthy habits in young children. The Committee provides $4,000,000 to the National Early Child Care Collaboratives to en-65 able training of early care and education providers in implementa- tion of healthy eating and physical activity best practices, including strategies for engaging families. Funds will also support technical assistance for integration of healthy eating and physical activity best practices into existing State and local professional develop-ment systems' early care and education settings, and health initia-tives. The Committee also encourages the program to serve a mix of rural, suburban and urban areas, including areas with high childhood obesity rates. Electronic Cigarettes .\u2014The Committee notes a rise in usage of electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, among U.S. middle and high school students. The Committee is aware of an ongoing NAM study on the health effects from e-cigarettes that is due out at the end of 2017, which will include recommendations for future federally funded research. The Committee encourages CDC to examine the recommendations from the NAM study and report to the Com-mittee on opportunities that may exist for further research. Epilepsy in Rural Areas.\u2014 The Committee encourages CDC to continue telehealth and educational training programs for rural and underserved areas that reach school nurses, child care per-sonnel, first responders, and care providers for seniors in order to recognize and respond appropriately to seizures caused by epilepsy or resulting from trauma and other acute chronic illness. Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention.\u2014 While largely preventable, cardiovascular disease, including heart disease and stroke, con-tinues to inflict the highest burden on our Nation's long-term health and economic stability. The Committee continues funding to support, strengthen, and expand heart disease and stroke preven-tion and control activities within State, local, and tribal public health departments and to enhance surveillance and research to target high burden populations and guide public health strategies. The Committee encourages CDC to prioritize these funds to com-munities with the highest disease burden of heart disease and stroke to identify and disseminate novel and innovative evidence- based strategies, including scientifically valid risk factor reduction measures, through competitive awards. Heart Valve Disease. \u2014The Committee understands that heart valve disease can be debilitating and if not treated properly can re-sult in heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, and death. The Com-mittee encourages CDC to include information on valve disease on its website and to help bring public awareness to this disease. The Committee encourages CDC to engage with patient and research organizations to explore collaborative ways to integrate information about the warning signs, symptoms, and risk factors of valve dis-ease into CDC's existing programs. High Obesity Rate Counties. \u2014The Committee remains concerned about the growing body of evidence suggesting that obesity is one of the most significant challenges facing the public health system. If this epidemic continues unabated, obesity and the many com-plications it causes will increase the disease burden among Ameri-cans, particularly youth. The Committee continues to include $10,000,000 to support the rural extension and outreach services grants for rural counties with an obesity prevalence of over 40 per-cent. The Committee expects CDC to work with State and local 66 public health departments to support measurable outcomes through evidenced-based obesity research, intervention, and pre-vention programs. Grants should combine basic, clinical, and popu-lation research to better understand and treat the metabolic, med-ical, surgical, environmental, and societal implications of obesity in cooperation with partners that have existing outreach capacity to develop and implement educational and intervention programs. Preference should be given to States where at least 10 percent of counties meet the requirements of this program. In addition, CDC shall focus its efforts in areas of the country with the highest bur-den of obesity and with the comorbidities of hypertension, cardiac disease, and diabetes from county level data in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The Committee encourages CDC to support only activities that are supported by scientific evidence. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases [IBD] .\u2014The Committee commends CDC for its commitment to the study of IBD epidemiology and is concerned by the results of the recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report which demonstrates that IBD affects 3,300,000 Americans, almost three times the number of adults previously es-timated to have IBD. The Committee is particularly concerned that IBD is increasingly recognized in minority and underserved com-munities and encourages CDC to complement its existing epidemio-logical study with a focus on these populations. Interstitial Cystitis [IC]. \u2014The Committee recommendation for IC activities provides support for the ongoing epidemiology study, as well as education, outreach, and public awareness activities. Lupus Registry. \u2014The Committee continues to support research efforts under the National Lupus Patient Registry program, but ac-knowledges that challenges still remain. Burden of illness studies are needed to better understand and evaluate issues such as the disease impact on quality of life, productivity, frequency of clinical events, natural history, and the direct and indirect costs associated with lupus. The Committee encourages CDC to support the lupus cohort and burden of illness studies. Million Hearts 2022 .\u2014The Committee supports Million Hearts 2022 and encourages CDC to capitalize on the solid foundation, best practices, evidence, shared tools, and progress made on this public-private initiative to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Con-tinued funding will allow implementation of evidence-based inter-ventions to prevent heart disease and stroke in areas with the highest burden by implementing the ABCS: aspirin when appro-priate, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and smok-ing cessation; supporting innovative strategies to increase physical activity; using cardiac rehabilitation; and developing innovative, scalable approaches to improve cardiovascular health. Mississippi Delta Health Collaborative [MDHC] .\u2014The Committee commends CDC's ongoing efforts to support the MDHC. The pro-gram has developed key partnerships at the local level and has im-plemented team-based approaches designed to link communities with clinical care. Within the funds provided for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the Committee encourages CDC to build on its longstanding investment in MDHC by working to replicate the work in additional sites while maintaining the current strategy. As it has in past years, CDC shall consider using lifestyle 67 change intervention models like the Diabetes Prevention Program; utilizing local pharmacy schools with existing community-based re-search programs that could focus on screenings, medication re-views, medication therapy management, comprehensive medication management, and disseminating prevention strategies; and work-ing with communities to establish health networks to better coordi-nate and manage community based health initiatives. To reach the target population, the Committee encourages CDC to take advan-tage of rapidly evolving healthcare technology by leveraging the re-sources of States with recognized leadership in areas of electronic medical records, telehealth, and innovative delivery of education tools. CDC shall provide an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis .\u2014The Committee recognizes the growing body of evidence linking psoriatic disease, which impacts more than 8,000,000 Americans, to other comorbidities such as car-diovascular disease, mental health and substance abuse challenges, kidney disease, and other conditions. The Committee encourages CDC to develop an action plan not later than 6 months after the enactment of this act as to how it can leverage existing programs and resources to build upon the agency's Public Health Agenda for Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis. Pulmonary Hypertension [PH] .\u2014The Committee understands that PH causes heart failure and death. CDC is encouraged to sup-port education, outreach, and awareness activities that promote early and accurate diagnosis of PH. Racial and Ethnic Approach to Community Health [REACH] .\u2014 The Committee eliminates the REACH program due to funding constraints. Funding continues to be provided to other programs that conduct outreach to reduce ethnic disparities in health status. Safe Motherhood Initiative. \u2014Preterm birth affects more than 500,000 babies each year in the United States and is the leading cause of neonatal mortality. The Committee commends CDC for funding State-based perinatal collaboratives that focus on improv-ing birth outcomes using known preventative strategies such as re-ducing early elective deliveries. Skin Cancer Education and Prevention.\u2014 The Committee is con- cerned with the growing number of people diagnosed with prevent-able forms of skin cancer, which is now the most commonly diag-nosed cancer in the United States. Every year in the United States, nearly 5,000,000 people are treated for skin cancer. Melanoma causes more deaths than any other type of skin cancer, resulting in over 9,000 deaths each year. The Committee encourages CDC to provide increased collaboration and partnership with local govern-ments, business, health, education, community, nonprofit and faith- based sectors in this effort. Sleep Surveillance .\u2014The Committee is pleased by CDC's work on a national public health awareness campaign for sleep. The Com-mittee encourages CDC to ensure that funding for surveillance ac-tivities on sleep disorders and sleep health is maintained in addi-tion to these awareness efforts. Stroke Prevention.\u2014 States in the Stroke Belt have age-adjusted stroke mortality rates that are significantly higher than the na-tional average. The Committee encourages the Division to further 68 focus its resources in the Stroke Belt, including the development of a comprehensive strategy to address stroke mortality and mor-bidity in the region. CDC shall provide an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. WISEWOMAN. \u2014The Committee lauds the WISEWOMAN pro- gram that helps uninsured and under-insured low-income women ages 40 to 64 decrease, prevent, or control heart disease and stroke by providing preventive health services, referrals to local health care providers, lifestyle programs, and health counseling services tailored to identified risk factors to promote lasting, healthy behav-ior change. Between July 2013 and June 2016, WISEWOMAN pro-vided an estimated 74,000 health behavioral support services and 51,000 blood pressure screenings. The Committee recognizes the critical role screening and referral programs play in reducing car-diovascular disease and directs CDC to explore innovative ap-proaches to expand the number of women served through WISEWOMAN and report the results to the Committee no later than September 30, 2018. NATIONAL CENTER ON BIRTH DEFECTS , DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES , DISABILITY AND HEALTH Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 100,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 139,560,000 The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities [NCBDDD] is $139,560,000. This Center improves the health of children and adults by pre- venting birth defects, developmental disabilities, and complications of heredity blood disorders and by promoting optimal child develop-ment and health and wellness among children and adults living with disabilities. Within the total provided, the following amounts are provided for the following categories of funding: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Total Birth Defects ......................................................................... 137,560 100,000 139,560 Child Health and Development 65,800 Other Birth Defects ...................................................... 19,000 N/A 19,000 Fetal Death .................................................................. 900 N/A 900 Fetal Alcohol 58,660 Disability and Health ................................................... 24,000 N/A 26,000 Tourette Syndrome ....................................................... 2,000 N/A 2,000 Early Hearing and N/A Muscular ....................... 1,900 N/A 1,900 Fragile X ....................................................................... 2,000 N/A 2,000 Spina Bifida ................................................................. 6,000 N/A 6,000 Congenital Heart Defects ............................................. 4,000 N/A 4,000 Public Health Approach to Blood Disorders ......................... 4,400 N/A 4,400 69 [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Hemophilia CDC Activities .................................................... 3,500 N/A 3,500 Hemophilia Treatment Centers ............................................. 5,100 N/A 5,100 Thalassemia .......................................................................... 2,100 N/A 2,100 Blood Safety Monitoring.\u2014 Facing an increase in infectious dis- eases that have a known or potential risk of transmission via blood transfusion, patients with thalassemia, anemia, and other diseases that impact blood production often face a lack of information about transmission modes and rates of infectious diseases, including new or emerging viruses like the Zika virus. The Committee encourages CDC to provide specific information to assist blood centers in re-sponding to emerging infectious diseases that may be transmitted by blood transfusion. Cerebral Palsy [CP] .\u2014The Committee encourages CDC to build upon existing surveillance and research applications of CP surveil-lance within the established 11 Autism and Developmental Disabil-ities Monitoring Network surveillance sites. The Committee recog-nizes and supports CDC's efforts to include CP surveillance in three existing sites and encourage CDC to expand this effort within current resources to additional sites allowing for a more nationally representative sample. Congenital Heart Disease [CHD] .\u2014CHD is the number one cat- egory of birth defects in the United States. The Committee notes that children and adults with CHD require ongoing, specialized cardiac care, and there remain gaps in data as children and adoles-cents transition to adult care. The Committee commends NCBDDD for its leadership in addressing CHD and adult CHD surveillance efforts and requests a report in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on CDC surveillance and research efforts regarding CHD across the life-span, age-specific prevalence, and factors associated with those pa-tients who may have dropped out of appropriate specialty care. Disability and Health Officer.\u2014 The Committee encourages CDC to re-appoint a Chief Disability and Health Officer and re-establish the Disability and Health Work Group to provide leadership, co-ordination, and collaboration among Centers in order to expand and improve efforts to enhance the health of individuals with dis-abilities. Fragile X and Associated Disorders. \u2014The Committee commends CDC's efforts to identify and define the population impacted by FX and FXD with the goal of understanding the public health impact of these conditions. The Committee acknowledges significant progress made by the NCBDDD Fragile X Clinical and Research Consortium in growing its FORWARD Database and its Patient Registry. CDC is encouraged to continue this effort. The Committee also supports the public-private partnership which resulted in the ''Future of Fragile X: Setting the Public Health Research Agenda'' meeting in 2014 and the resulting Funding Opportunity Announce-ment which seeks to use longitudinal data to characterize the nat-ural history of Fragile X to improve services and outcomes. The Committee encourages the NCBDDD to continue data-driven public 70 health research to reduce the public health burden of both FX and autism. Health and Development for Those With Disabilities .\u2014The Com- mittee supports CDC awards under the National Centers on Health Promotion for People with Disabilities and its goal of promoting better health for adults and children with disabilities. By mobi-lizing national networks to provide technical assistance, provide community leaders and community organizations with health pro-motion training, and by disseminating effective strategies and tools for disability service providers, these awards play an important role in encouraging a healthier lifestyle for Americans with disabil-ities. Hemophilia .\u2014The Committee has included sufficient funding to maintain the Center's hemophilia programs, which provide critical information to better understand risk factors for complications and identify high-risk populations for prevention measures. The Com-mittee recognizes the importance of CDC's research on inhibitors and recommends that CDC enhance the inhibitor surveillance pro-gram and further prevention and eradication activities. The Com-mittee encourages CDC, working with stakeholders and the net-work of hemophilia treatment centers, to implement inhibitor test-ing across the United States and support further research to better understand inhibitors and how they can be prevented. Improving the Health of People With Intellectual Disabilities Through Physical Activity .\u2014People with disabilities have a high risk of poor health outcomes such as obesity, hypertension, and mood disorders such as depression. Therefore, the Committee in-cludes $8,700,000 for the Healthy Athletes program. Marfan Syndrome .\u2014The Committee remains concerned that structural cardiovascular disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, con-tinue to claim the lives of high school athletes across the country who received a sports physical prior to competition. CDC is encour-aged to work with patient and professional stakeholders to develop minimum screening guidelines that ensure all young athletes are appropriately screened for potentially life-threatening structural cardiovascular disorders. Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance. \u2014The Committee is aware of CDC's established surveillance efforts through the Muscular Dys-trophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network [MD STARnet] and encourages CDC to continue its work to enhance the quality and quantity of the data being collected through MD STARnet. Additionally, the Committee is interested in CDC's plans to disseminate and implement the updated care standards, includ-ing for adults with Duchenne and for other forms of muscular dys-trophy. The Committee also supports CDC's engagement of mul-tiple Divisions and Centers in the development of a Duchenne new-born screening program along with the refinement of an Inter-national Classification of Disease code for Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy. Sickle Cell Disease [SCD].\u2014 SCD is a lifelong inherited blood dis- order affecting nearly 100,000 Americans who are unable to access specialized quality care and effective treatment options. The Com-mittee encourages CDC to continue and expand its SCD surveil-lance program to better understand and address long term health 71 outcomes, complications, and unmet health care access and to ini- tiate a public health awareness campaign for people with SCD and a sickle cell trait. Spina Bifida. \u2014While spina bifida and related neural tube defects are highly preventable through education and adequate daily folic acid consumption, they are the most common permanently dis-abling birth defect in the United States. The Committee supports the continuation of the Spina Bifida Clinical Care Monitoring and Tracking program and commends the National Spina Bifida Pro- gram in serving as a model for programs assisting other individ-uals living with similar complex conditions. The Committee encour-ages CDC to continue the dissemination of information to clini-cians, parents, and families living with spina bifida. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex [TSC]. \u2014The Committee encourages CDC to take into consideration all the major manifestations of TSC in its surveillance network. PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENTIFIC SERVICES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $489,397,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 460,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 489,397,000 The Committee recommendation for Public Health Scientific Services is $489,397,000. This funding supports the work of all of the CDC Centers by compiling statistical information to inform public health policy. In particular, these activities assure the accuracy and reliability of laboratory tests; apply digital information technology to help detect and manage diseases, injuries, and syndromes; and develop and in-form the public health community on sound public health surveil-lance, laboratory protocols, and epidemiological practices. The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol- lowing activities in the following amounts: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Health Statistics ............................................................................ 160,397 155,000 160,397 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and PH Informatics ........................... 279,000 260,000 279,000 Public Health Workforce ................................................................. 50,000 45,000 50,000 Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia. \u2014The Committee is aware of recent peer-reviewed studies suggesting that more than 500,000 U.S. deaths each year are attributable to Alzheimer's disease and dementia, far in excess of the deaths reported by the Center each year. Such statistics would elevate Alzheimer's disease from the sixth leading cause of death to the third leading cause of death. The Committee looks forward to receiving CDC recommendations on ways to ensure the accuracy and completeness of measurements of the Alzheimer's disease and dementia death rate and to develop a consensus on the mortality burden of the disease. Digital Bridge.\u2014 The Committee remains interested in an inte- grated public health surveillance strategy to improve real-time sur-veillance and situational awareness. The Committee is encouraged 72 by efforts underway at CDC and by public-private partnerships such as the Digital Bridge initiative that connect the health care system, electronic health record vendors, and public health authori-ties at all levels to reduce reporting burden and scientific, adminis-trative, and fiscal inefficiencies. Modernizing Vital Statistics Collection .\u2014While most States have or will soon have operational electronic birth and death registration systems, many do not have the resources to maximize electronic death reporting or to modernize their systems to keep pace with new technology. The Committee encourages CDC to support States in upgrading antiquated systems and improving the quality and ac-curacy of vital statistics reporting. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $215,750,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 157,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 180,750,000 The Committee recommendation for the National Center for En- vironmental Health is $180,750,000. The Committee recommenda-tion includes $17,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. This does not include $35,000,000 in one-time multi-year lead poisoning prevention and registry funding for Flint, Michigan provided in fis-cal year 2017. The National Center for Environmental Health addresses emerg- ing pathogens and environmental toxins that pose significant chal-lenges to public health. The Center conducts surveillance and data collection to determine which substances in the environment are found in people and to what degree. The Center also determines whether and at what level of exposure these substances are harm-ful to humans. The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol- lowing activities: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Environmental Health Laboratory .................................................. 56,150 55,894 56,150 Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program ..................

Lateral Sclerosis [ALS] Registry .\u2014The Committee continues to support the purpose of the National ALS Registry and seeks to understand how to build upon current efforts to improve data collection. The Committee directs CDC to review the ALS reg-73 istry and submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and Senate within one year of enact-ment of this act to determine the compliance of the ALS registry with Congressional intent as laid out in Public Law 110-373. The report should include the cost of maintaining the registry, a review of how the National ALS registry interacts with State, local, and Federal registries to build upon existing data, and recommenda-tions on how to improve the surveillance quality of the registry. Asthma.\u2014 The Committee continues to support the work of the National Asthma Control Program, recognizing that asthma is one of the most common and costly health conditions in the United States. The Committee understands that better coordination of public health and health systems interventions are necessary to re-duce the burden caused by asthma and encourages CDC to con-tinue its collaboration with payers and health systems. Environmental Health Activities .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the increasing health effects on people with asthma, cardio-vascular disease, and other chronic diseases caused by increased spread of vector-borne disease, air pollution, extreme weather events, and longer allergy seasons. The Committee directs CDC to continue to help state and local health departments plan for these public health threats and to focus on protecting the most vulner-able individuals and communities. Hormone Standardization.\u2014 The Committee is encouraged by the work CDC's Environmental Health Laboratory has done to date to help ensure the accuracy and reliability of testing for certain hor-mones through its standardization program. The Committee recog-nizes that gaps still remain in hormone standardization to ensure reliable and actionable results. The Committee requests a report in the fiscal year 2019 CJ outlining what is necessary for the agency to increase the standardization of clinical laboratory testing to help prevent misdiagnoses and reduce unnecessary health expenses. Lead Poisoning .\u2014The Committee notes that the fiscal year 2017 Omnibus provided an additional $35,000,000 in multi-year lead poi-soning prevention efforts for a lead exposure registry and an advi-sory committee. CDC is directed to provide a status update on these activities in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Newborn Screening.\u2014 The Committee requests CDC provide an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on actions planned and on-going to work with States on ways to ensure screening of infants for dis-eases for which there is a preventable and/or effective treatment. Further, the update should note what steps can be taken to encour-age States to adopt and implement new Recommended Uniform Screening Panel conditions within one year of their addition. INJURY PREVENTION AND CONTROL Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $286,059,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 216,165,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 291,059,000 The Committee recommendation for the National Center for In- jury Prevention and Control is $291,059,000. CDC is the lead Federal agency for injury prevention and control. Programs are designed to prevent premature death and disability and reduce human suffering and medical costs caused by fires and 74 burns, poisoning, drowning, violence, and traffic accidents. The na- tional injury control program at CDC encompasses non-occupa-tional injury and applied research in acute care and rehabilitation of the injured. The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol- lowing activities: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Intentional Injury ............................................................................ 97,730 97,730 102,730 Domestic Domestic Violence Community Projects 5,500 Rape Prevention .................................................................... 44,430 44,430 49,430 National Violent Death Overdose Risk ............................ Centers .................................................... 9,000 ............................ 9,000 Biosurveillance Program.\u2014 The Committee continues to be very concerned about the high rate of opioid abuse and understands data can facilitate forecasting of overdose risk by geographic re-gion. Therefore, the Committee instructs CDC to begin using data from the Enhanced State Surveillance of Opioid-Involved Morbidity and Mortality program to provide such forecasts that public health officials can use to intervene and prevent overdoses. CDC should focus on States experiencing the highest rates of opioid related overdosing then expand into a national system. Combating Opioid Abuse .\u2014CDC Prescription Drug Overdose Pre- vention [PDO] activities fund critical work in all 50 States and Washington, DC. Activities support rigorous monitoring, evalua-tion, and improvements in data quality at a national level, includ-ing data collection and analysis on heroin-related overdose deaths. These funds provide States with the greatest burden of opioid abuse the ability to implement prevention activities and improve interventions that monitor prescribing and dispensing practices. This includes maximizing the use of State-based Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs [PDMPs] as a public health tool to assist in clinical decision-making and in conducting surveillance. The Com-mittee expects CDC to continue to expand and evaluate an innova-tive model to coordinate care for high-risk opioid patients to ensure safer, more effective care. Further the Committee strongly encour-ages CDC to support local prevention activity to determine the ef-fectiveness of naltrexone in treating heroin and prescription drug abuse and reducing diversion of buprenorphine for illicit purposes Concussion Surveillance .\u2014The 2013 NAS study ''Sports-Related Concussions in Youth: Improving the Science, Changing the Cul-ture'' recommended that CDC establish and oversee a national sur-veillance system to accurately determine the incidence of sports-re-75 lated concussions, including youth ages 5 to 21. The Committee is aware of the promising progress CDC has made in creating a com-prehensive survey instrument which the agency will be piloting in the coming months to prepare for a national survey in the future. The Committee supports CDC's work in this area and urges the agency to increase its efforts. Opioid Prescribing Guidelines .\u2014The Committee commends CDC for building awareness about responsible opioid prescribing prac-tices by publishing the Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chron-ic Pain. The Committee notes that opioid prescribing for acute pain remains a significant driver of initial opioid prescriptions, espe-cially for youth. The Committee encourages CDC to continue its leadership in prevention of the opioid epidemic by developing pre-scribing guidelines for acute pain, including those which are appli-cable to emergency physicians, surgeons, and dentists. CDC is en-couraged to coordinate with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to develop and disseminate clin-ical decision support tools derived from the opioid prescribing guidelines. CDC is also urged to work with the VA and the DOD on implementing these guidelines to ensure consistent, high-quality care standards across the Federal Government. Pain Reporting.\u2014 The Committee notes that pain is a public health problem that causes tremendous burden on the health care system. The Committee notes CDC's prior reports focusing on pain, but recognizes that more complete and comprehensive epidemiolog-ical data is needed. CDC is urged to investigate the collection of data that clarifies the incidence and prevalence of various pain syn-dromes differentiated by patient age, comorbidities, socio-economic status, profession, race and gender. Rape Prevention.\u2014 The Committee recognizes that 25 percent of rape prevention programs currently have a wait time of over a month. The Committee therefore has provided an increase of $5,000,000 for CDC's rape prevention and education program and directs that at least 75 percent of the program's funds go to States for State and local prevention activities. Trauma Surveillance.\u2014 The Committee commends CDC for pro- viding funding to States to conduct surveillance on youth and adult behavioral risk factors. The Committee encourages CDC to prioritize collection and reporting of data on adverse childhood ex-periences, including exposure to violence. The Committee also en-courages CDC to report on the prevalence of adverse childhood ex-periences across geography, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic status and to examine ways to target such areas or populations with high rates of measured adverse childhood experiences. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $335,200,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 200,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 335,200,000 The Committee recommendation for National Institute for Occu- pational Safety and Health [NIOSH] programs is $335,200,000. NIOSH is the only Federal agency responsible for conducting re- search and making recommendations for the prevention of work-re-lated illness and injury. The NIOSH mission is implemented by 76 conducting basic and applied scientific research and translating the knowledge gained into products and services that impact workers in settings from corporate offices to construction sites to coal mines. Total Worker Health .\u2014The Committee commends CDC's Total Worker Health Program, which aims to promote and protect the health and productivity of the American workforce through re-search and dissemination of innovative and cost-effective tools and interventions for American businesses. The Committee commends CDC's work in this area and encourages CDC to continue dissemi-nation of these tools. The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol- lowing activities at the following amounts: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Total NIOSH .................................................................................... 335,200 200,000 335,200 National Occupational Research Agenda Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing (non-add) ...................... 25,500 Education and Research Centers N/A 29,000 Personal Protective Technology ............................................. 20,000 N/A 20,000 Mining Research ................................................................... 59,500 N/A 59,500 National Mesothelioma Registry and Tissue Bank ............... 1,100 N/A 1,100 Other Occupational Safety and Health Research ................. 109,600 N/A 109,600 ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL INJURY COMPENSATION 2017 ............................................................................. $55,358,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 55,358,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 55,358,000 The Committee recommendation for the Energy Employees Occu- pational Illness Compensation Program Act [EEOICPA] is $55,358,000. This mandatory funding supports NIOSH scientists who reconstruct radiation dose levels to inform compensation deci-sions. GLOBAL HEALTH Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $435,121,000 Budget estimate, 2018 350,000,000 Committee The Committee recommends $433,621,000 for global health-re- lated activities at CDC. The Center for Global Health leads international programs and coordinates CDC's global efforts with the goal of promoting health and preventing disease in the United States and abroad. The Cen-ter has a particular focus on ensuring rapid detection and response to emerging health threats. The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol- lowing activities in the following amounts: 77 [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Global HIV/AIDS Program ............................................................... Preventable Parasitic Diseases and Malaria. 24,500 26,000 Global Public Health Protection ..................................................... 58,200 50,000 55,200 Global Disease Detection and Emergency Response ........... 48,400 N/A 45,400 Global Public Health Capacity Development ........................ 9,800 N/A 9,800 CDC Global Health Security and Global Health Research.\u2014 The Committee supports CDC's work to protect American and global health security through the Center for Global Health, the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, and other programs that detect, prevent, and respond to infectious disease and other health threats. The Committee supports continued work in health research, innovation, capacity building for disease re-search, detection, and surveillance, and robust monitoring and evaluation systems at home and abroad. Malaria and Parasitic Diseases. \u2014The Committee recognizes the important role the Center for Global Health plays in the fight against malaria and parasitic diseases. CDC's crucial monitoring and surveillance of transmission, evaluation of interventions for ef-fectiveness and impact, and testing of tools in a real world setting are critical to understanding how to scale up global health pro-grams and ensure that our global health investments are smarter, better, and not wasteful. The Committee encourages CDC to con-tinue to research, monitor, and evaluate efforts for malaria and parasitic disease in collaboration with other divisions and agencies. Polio .\u2014CDC is the lead U.S. agency in the global effort to eradi- cate polio and currently works with various organizations by pro-viding expertise in training, vaccines, epidemiology, laboratory ca-pacity, and surveillance. Currently, polio is endemic in only three countries, Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Committee commends these efforts to help eradicate this disease. Soil Transmitted Helminth and Related ''Diseases of Poverty'' [STH].\u2014 STH infections when found in the United States are most frequently seen in poverty stricken, rural populations. Surveillance studies through school-based clinics have been successful in pro-viding safe treatments and public health interventions to reduce in-fection burden, but in some areas with high STH-infection, there is no surveillance or remediation effort underway. Therefore, with-in the funds provided, the Committee includes $1,500,000 to CDC for surveillance, source remediation, and clinical care aimed at re-ducing STH-infection in an area not being addressed by current CDC outreach. The clinical care effort shall be led by an academic medical center with collaboration from State health agencies, uni-versities, and public health entities and shall be located in a rural, agrarian area with high incidence of STH-infection, poverty, and chronic disease, especially among children. 78 PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,405,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 1,266,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,405,000,000 The Committee recommendation for the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response [PHPR] is $1,405,000,000. The mission of PHPR is to build and strengthen national pre- paredness for public health emergencies including natural, biologi-cal, chemical, radiological, and nuclear incidents. PHPR admin-isters national response programs and assets, as well as grants to States and localities to enhance preparedness efforts across the country. The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol- lowing activities in the following amounts: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement .. 660,000 551,000 660,000 Academic Centers for Public 8,200 ............................ 8,200 BioSense 138,800 National Stockpile .......................................................... Preparedness .\u2014The Committee recognizes the impor- tance of the Public Health Emergency Preparedness program [PHEP] in helping States and territories strengthen their public health system capacity. In doing so, the Committee does not in-clude the proposed cut to the program and instead provides the same level of funding as fiscal year 2017. The Committee continues to request detailed information on how PHEP funding is distrib-uted at the local level by States. CDC is encouraged to provide in the fiscal year 2019 CJ an update on how much of the Federal PHEP funding is being allocated to local health departments and what basis or formula each State is using to make such allocations. Strategic National Stockpile.\u2014 The Committee encourages CDC to evaluate the latest approved advances in influenza prevention and antiviral treatment for inclusion in the SNS in preparation for pandemic influenza. Further, the Committee encourages BARDA and CDC to better coordinate the handoff of new countermeasures being purchased for the Strategic National Stockpile and, as appro-priate, maintain BARDA involvement to negotiate technical details of future procurement. The Committee requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this act detailing the number of potential FDA-approved MCMs that will be needed in the SNS over the next 3 fiscal years (including new products or products currently in the SNS that will require replenishment), and the anticipated costs to purchase these products while maintaining current SNS products. B UILDINGS AND FACILTIIES Appropriations, 2017 estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 20,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 10,000,000 79 The Committee recommendation for Buildings and Facilities is $10,000,000. NIOSH Facility .\u2014The Committee is aware that CDC plans to consolidate the NIOSH Cincinnati research facilities, which are more than 50 years old, into one modern laboratory in order to re-duce operational costs and strengthen scientific collaboration. The Committee understands that CDC plans to support this facility re-placement through the Department's Nonrecurring Expense Fund. The Secretary and CDC are directed to prioritize obligations for this facility and obligate such funds as quickly as possible in fiscal year 2018. Replacement of the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine and Labora- tory.\u2014The Secretary is directed to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and Senate detailing activities to replace the Lake Lynn Laboratory. The Committee continues to support CDC efforts to find a replace-ment facility. CDC-WIDE ACTIVITIES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. Committee recommendation 273,570,000 The Committee provides $273,570,000 for public health leader- ship and support activities at CDC. The recommendation includes $160,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol- lowing activities in the following amounts: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant ..................... 160,000 ............................ 160,000 Public Health Leadership and Support ......................................... 113,570 105,000 113,570 Preventative Health and Health Services Block Grant. \u2014The Com- mittee continues to oppose this administration's and the previous administration's proposal to eliminate this program. The Com-mittee provides $160,000,000, the same level as in fiscal year 2017. These grants are crucial for States because they provide enough flexibility necessary to resolve any emerging health issues at the local level while tailoring those activities to best address the di-verse, complex, and constantly changing local community. The Committee does not include bill language requested by the administration to provide additional transfer authority to the Di-rector beyond that which is already provided to the Secretary. N ATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH The National Institutes of Health [NIH] is the global leader in medical research and the Committee provides an increase of $2,000,000,000 for a third year in a row after a decade of stagnant funding. The Committee provides $36,084,000,000 for NIH activi-80 ties within the jurisdiction of this bill, an increase of 5.9 percent above fiscal year 2017. This includes $1,074,443,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act. The Committee con-tinues a reform to section 241 allocations such that no NIH funding will be removed from NIH under this authority. This reform en-sures that section 241 transfers are a benefit to NIH rather than a liability. In addition, it improves the transparency of NIH's budg-et, so that the enacted total is truly the amount the Committee ex-pects to be used for biomedical research. The Committee continues its commitment to funding research on Alzheimer's disease and increases funding by $414,000,000 to a total of approximately $1,828,000,000 in fiscal year 2018; increases funding for the Precision Medicine Initiative by $10,000,000; in-creases funding for antibiotic resistance research by $50,000,000; and increases funding for the BRAIN Initiative by $140,000,000. In addition, funding is provided to ensure that every Institute and Center receives an increase above fiscal year 2017 to continue in-vestments in innovative research that will advance the funda-mental knowledge and speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics, and preventive measures to improve the health of all Americans. Revolutionary discoveries often come from unexpected, untargeted research. The Committee continues to support these basic advances as well as the clinical and translational research that moves basic discoveries from ''bench-to-bedside.'' The Committee rejects the administration's proposals to: cap Fa- cilities and Administrative costs; eliminate the John E. Fogarty International Center; and create the National Institute for Re-search on Safety and Quality. NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $5,671,926,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 4,474,222,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 5,858,270,000 The Committee recommendation includes $5,858,270,000 for the National Cancer Institute [NCI], including $300,000,000 appro-priated from the NIH Innovation Account. Of this amount, $30,000,000 is available for repairs and improvements to the NCI facility in Frederick, Maryland. Cancer Kinome. \u2014The Committee is aware that research into the role of kinases\u2014enzymes in the human genome that regulate an immense variety of cellular function\u2014holds the promise to drive the development of new treatments and cures for a variety of can-cers, including ovarian cancer. The challenge today is to collectively investigate the role of the kinome in triggering cancer and gaining a better understanding of which kinases play a role in cancer de-velopment in particular patients, and how kinome ''reprogram-ming'' contributes to resistance to anti-cancer drugs. NCI is asked to support this type of promising personalized medicine research. Cancer and Mitochondria.\u2014 The Committee commends the NCI for its work in establishing a Mitochondrial Model Organisms and Cellular Systems Working Group and for its work to identify needs, barriers, and opportunities pertaining to mitochondrial biology rel-evant to addressing mechanistic questions in cancer. The Com-mittee encourages the NCI to continue to support qualified re-81 search studies that examine the mechanisms by which cancer cells utilize oxidative stress in stromal cells to fuel their growth. Deadliest Cancers.\u2014 The Committee remains concerned that while more effective screening methods and treatments have low-ered overall cancer incidence and death rates, some forms of cancer remain extremely difficult to diagnose and treat. Defined in statute as ''recalcitrant cancers''\u2014those whose 5-year survival rate is below 50 percent\u2014they account for nearly half of all cancer deaths in the U.S. and include cancers of the pancreas, liver, ovary, brain, stom-ach, esophagus, and lung. Given the toll these types of cancer exact on society, the Committee urges NIH and NCI to continue to sup-port research with an emphasis on developing improved screening and early detection tools and more effective treatments. The Com-mittee expects to receive an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ of how NCI is advancing these goals. Gastric Cancer.\u2014 The Committee continues to be concerned about the deadly outcomes of gastric cancer, particularly among young adults. The 5-year survival rate for stomach cancer is 30 percent. The Committee notes that research on gastric cancer is less ad-vanced than that of many other cancers. The lack of research fund-ing makes it difficult to attract researchers to the field and make progress toward curative treatments. The Committee therefore en-courages NCI to consider developing a scientific framework, as specified by the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-239, section 1083), for advancing stomach cancer re-search. Gynecologic Cancer Clinical Trials.\u2014 Clinical trials have signifi- cantly improved survival for women with gynecologic cancers, in-cluding ovarian, endometrial, cervical, and vulvar cancers. The Committee urges the NCI to continue to work with stakeholders through the NCI National Clinical Trials Network Gynecologic Cancers Steering Committee to address priorities for the gynecologic oncology clinical trials scientific agenda, including in-creasing the availability of trials for these patients. The Committee requests that NCI provide an update to the Committee in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. IDeA States and Cancer Clinical Trials. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes that NCI supports clinical trials across the country through its National Clinical Trials Network [NCTN] and the NCI Commu-nity Oncology Research Program [NCORP]. The Committee under-stands that there are more than 270 NCORP component sites and 14 NCORP awardees across the country located in IDeA States, and that NCI supports several NCI-designated cancer centers in IDeA States. At the same time, the Committee recognizes that there are still opportunities for academic medical centers in IDeA States to become more engaged in these networks. Therefore, the Committee encourages NCI to coordinate with NIGMS in helping Clinical and Translational Research award sites in IDeA States that do not currently have NCORP or NCTN awards build capacity in these regions to conduct cancer clinical trials. The Committee also encourages NCI to continue to support NCORP in its mission to increase diversity among patients participating in NCI clinical trials, especially with regard to rural and minority populations. Fi-nally, the Committee urges NCI, in consultation with NIGMS, to 82 encourage collaboration between IDeA awardees and existing NCI designated cancer centers, NCTN lead sites, and NCORP sites. Immunotherapy. \u2014NCI-funded research on the immune system's ability to find and destroy tumors has led to a new wave of prom-ising treatments for many forms of cancer. Yet much remains un-known about how immunotherapy works on a cellular level, and es-pecially why such treatments are successful for some patients but not for others. Without a better understanding of the immune sys-tem's response to cancer and knowing how cancer escapes immune- based therapy, further advances in this field will be slowed. There-fore, the Committee urges NCI to continue to prioritize basic re-search on the mechanisms of action involved in immunotherapy, in-cluding a focus on tumor resistance to immunotherapy. The Com-mittee also recognizes the need for more basic and clinical re-searchers who have the necessary education to develop new break-throughs in immunotherapy. The Committee encourages NCI to continue to support fellowships and T32 training awards for both young and mid-career researchers interested in immunotherapy. Liver Cancer.\u2014 The Committee notes that in the U.S. liver cancer is the second deadliest cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15 percent, and according to the CDC, unlike many other can-cers, the rates of liver cancer deaths and incidence are rising. In spite of its growing mortality, research spending focused on liver cancer is not even among the 20 largest NCI cancers research pro-grams; NCI has few liver cancer-oriented grants in its portfolio, and it does not have a Specialized Program of Research Excellence [SPORE] for liver cancer. To increase the 5-year survivability of liver cancer, the Committee urges that NCI support liver cancer re-search across its portfolio using a variety of methods to stimulate research proposals. The Committee also notes that the link be-tween hepatitis B infection and primary liver cancer is well estab-lished with up to 60 percent of global liver cancer cases caused by the hepatitis B virus [HBV] and, therefore, urges close collabora-tion with NIAID and NIDDK on issues related to HBV research. Lung Cancer.\u2014 The Committee encourages NCI to continue to prioritize support for meritorious research for lung cancer gen-erally, as well as for research specifically related to early detection and continued advances in treatment with personalized medicine, immunotherapy, and other innovative treatments. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on these efforts. Metastatic Brain Tumor Research.\u2014 Metastatic brain tumors are the most common brain tumor in adults. While the exact incidence of metastatic brain tumors is not known, it is estimated at between 200,000 and 300,000 people per year. The Cancer Moonshot Initia-tive has helped to raise awareness of this often neglected form of cancer, and the Committee urges NCI to continue working with stakeholder organizations to advance research into improving brain imaging technologies and developing treatments to increase survi-vorship. Neuroblastoma. \u2014The Committee encourages NCI to expand its support for research on high-risk neuroblastoma, including the de-tection and treatment of central nervous system metastases. The Committee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. 83 Pancreatic Cancer.\u2014 In 2016, pancreatic cancer rose to become the third-leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S., claim-ing the lives of nearly 42,000 Americans. Despite progress in com-bating other forms of cancer, pancreatic cancer remains the only major cancer with a 5-year survival rate in the single digits, at nine percent, in large part because there are no reliable early de-tection methods nor effective treatment options. To help turn the tide against this deadly cancer, Congress in 2012 passed the Recal-citrant Cancer Research Act (Public Law 112-239), calling for the development of scientific frameworks for certain cancers. The Com-mittee requests an update on pancreatic cancer in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Pediatric Cancer.\u2014 The Committee remains concerned about the lack of child-specific solutions for pediatric cancer patients and the consistent overall rise in rate of incidence (35 percent increase since 1975). The Committee acknowledges that the needs of pedi-atric cancer patients are unique and different from the needs of adults with cancer. The majority of cancers in children are not seen in the adult population, but the vast majority of solutions continue to be adopted and adapted from adult cancer drugs for use in chil-dren, despite the toxicity of the drugs for their small developing bodies. The consequences continue to leave two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors with serious lifelong complications and one-third of childhood cancer survivors dead by the age of 36. As a result, cancer continues to kill more children than all other diseases com-bined. The Committee notes that childhood cancer is unique from adult cancer and should be approached from a child-specific per-spective. Accordingly, the Committee urges the NCI to continue to support research that addresses the unique characteristics of child-hood cancers and the unique needs of childhood survivors. There are some encouraging efforts currently focusing on child-specific so-lutions, and there should continue to be parallel efforts to deter-mine the efficacy of adult research and treatments for childhood cancer; however, they should not be the primary focus. Just as adult research hopes to benefit children, it is more likely childhood cancer research may benefit adults. Therefore, the Committee en-courages the continuation of important pediatric oncology research, including clinical trials for children with brain tumors and pre-clinical testing program evaluating new agents for treating pedi-atric malignancies. Within the additional resources provided for cancer research, the Committee requests a report within 120 days after enactment of this act on how the NCI is focusing on the unique needs of children. The Committee also encourages NCI to continue its investments in the novel pediatric Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice [MATCH] study. The Committee requests an update on the progress of MATCH implementation for children with cancer, with specific information on issues such as accrual, participating institutions, and the scope and progress of the trials in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Precision Medicine Initiative [PMI].\u2014 The Committee continues its strong support of NCI PMI and provides no less than $80,000,000 to continue its efforts to develop individualized treat-ments for cancer patients. The Committee recognizes the potential for significant advancements in cancer treatments from the NCI 84 MATCH trial. It remains the central pillar of the precision medi- cine research focused on oncology for cancers that are unresponsive to standard interventions. The Committee urges NCI to continue to expand precision oncology trials. NCI should also continue to focus on launching the important pediatric MATCH trial as pediatric on-cology mechanisms are very different from mutations seen in adults. Further, the Committee continues to believe in the neces-sity of NCI-funded clinical trials in the area of immuno-oncology, where a patient's engineered T-cells are used in combination with the immune system to fight late stage disease and commends NCI for its continued leadership in this area. Of particular interest is the use of precision medicine to develop therapies for late stage cancers and for those forms of the disease for which meaningful conventional treatments have proved largely ineffective for long term survival of the patients. NCI shall provide an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Prostate Cancer.\u2014 The Committee is aware of NCI's ongoing in- vestment in prostate cancer research and is concerned that pros-tate cancer lacks treatments for men with advancing disease as well as adequate diagnostic and imaging methodologies common in other hormone-driven cancers with similar disease burden. To en-sure Federal resources are leveraged to the greatest extent pos-sible, the Committee encourages NCI to continue to coordinate its response to these needs with other Federal agencies, including DOD, as well as private research foundations and advocacy groups. Psycho-Social Distress Complications.\u2014 According to the Institute of Medicine, nearly 50 percent of all cancer patients experience dis-tress. Further, studies suggest that distress in cancer patients leads to higher healthcare costs, less compliance with treatment pathways, and poorer health outcomes. While significant advance-ments have been made in biomedical treatments in cancer care, the Committee is concerned that the unaddressed psycho-social needs of patients are adversely impacting the effectiveness and cost of care, as well as the individuals' overall well-being. The Committee encourages NCI to continue to implement distress screenings in the NIH Clinical Center and in NCI-funded clinical trials as appro-priate, coordinate and share information on this effort with the FDA, and provide an update on such activities in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Research Initiative on Ethnic and Racial Diversity in Cancer .\u2014 The Committee recognizes that the NIH's Cancer Moonshot initia-tive aims to accelerate the discovery of new ways to cure cancers, including through an understanding and application of cancer ge-netic information to the prevention and treatment of cancer. The Committee urges the NIH, through the NIMHD and NCI, to con-tinue to support research on the cause, prevention, and treatment of cancer in populations with diverse cultural, racial, and ethnic composition. To further support such collaborations, the NCI is en-couraged to consider research expertise in ethnic and racial diver-sity and its impact on cancer development and outcomes in evalu-ating applications for NCI-designated cancer centers. Sleep Health and Cancer.\u2014 The Committee understands the com- plex intersection between sleep health and cancer development, cancer progression, and remission. The Committee encourages NCI 85 to continue to explore the role of sleep health in cancer develop- ment and progression. Translational Research Program.\u2014 The Committee notes the SPORE program is NCI's cornerstone effort to promote collabo-rative, interdisciplinary translational cancer research. The Com-mittee continues robust support for the SPORE grant program as it works to bring basic research into practical treatments. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on the SPORE program. Translational Science of Natural Products for Cancer.\u2014 The Com- mittee has recognized the importance of moving natural products and their derivatives through development and testing, with the goal of accelerating the designation of Investigational New Drug to promising natural products that can treat cancer. The Committee directs NCI to continue to support this work. NATIONAL HEART , LUNG , AND BLOOD INSTITUTE Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 2,534,803,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,322,774,000 The Committee recommendation includes $3,322,774,000 for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI]. Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of well characterized, longitudinal, popu-lation-based cohort studies in providing insights into risk factors related to dementia, with special focus on minority populations where disease burden is greatest. As the participants in these stud-ies have aged, much has been learned about cognitive decline and the role of mid-life risk factors, but key challenges remain, particu-larly in the identification of biomarkers and in understanding the role of environmental versus genetic factors. Therefore, within the provided funds, the Committee directs NHLBI to recruit and exam-ine the subsequent generations of such cohorts, as studying the adult children of these extensively characterized cohort members may provide new insights into risk identification and accelerated prevention efforts. The project shall conduct clinical examinations, including brain imaging, of this second generation of participants. Asthma.\u2014 The Committee notes with concern the evidence sug- gesting a causal link between air pollution and the development of asthma. The Committee urges NHLBI and the NIEHS to explore this potential causal link and any interventions necessary to pre-vent the development of asthma. Congenital Heart Disease [CHD].\u2014 The Committee commends NHLBI for its continued work to better understand causation and appropriate treatments for those with the most life threatening congenital heart defects through its biomedical research program 'Bench to Bassinet' and the critical multi-centered infrastructure of the Pediatric Heart Network. NHLBI should also explore how the new adult CHD accreditation program, that advances and sets quality standards for care, can inform its work in this area. The Committee urges NHLBI to continue its work with other Federal agencies and professional and patient organizations to expand col-laborative activities targeted toward prevention and treatment of the diverse lifelong needs of children and adults living with CHD. 86 The Committee requests a report on these efforts in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Cystic Fibrosis [CF].\u2014 The Committee applauds the work of NIH to support translational research tools that spur the development of new therapies for rare diseases like cystic fibrosis. Animal mod-els are critical tools for understanding disease progression and identifying potential new treatments. The National Swine Resource and Research Center [NSRRC], funded by the NIH and hosted at the University of Missouri, provides services to develop swine mod-els of many genetic conditions, like cystic fibrosis, to facilitate re-search and drug development for these diseases. The Committee encourages the continuation of jointly funded clinical research pro-grams occurring at CF care centers in Missouri and across the country. One such project, the OPTIMIZE study, has brought to-gether hospital systems in nearly 30 States to compare treatments for lung infections in those with CF to determine if a commonly used combination of antibiotics is safe and effective. Real world clinical trials such as this one are often only supported by NIH and non-profit organizations, and they may significantly improve care and treatment for people with serious, life-threatening diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Fibrotic Diseases.\u2014 The Committee encourages NIH to continue to vigorously support research into fibrotic diseases affecting dif-ferent organs, including the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, skin, and bones and to ensure enhanced coordination among its Institutes as they conduct necessary, expanded single organ or cross-organ fi-brotic disease research to save lives and reduce healthcare ex-penses in future years. The Committee also encourages NIH to ex-plore naturally occurring fibrotic disease in domestic animals to in-vestigate opportunities to improve human and animal lives. Since many fibrotic diseases are individually rare diseases, a strategy that provides collaboration across disease and organ areas is rec-ommended. Furthermore, the Committee encourages NIH to con-tinue to provide oversight and direction through coordinated multi- institute activities to improve research efforts and avoid redun-dancy. The Committee requests a report on the current NIH Fibro-sis Interest Group and its progress, which brings together key stakeholders at the NIH and elsewhere, to evaluate current re-search efforts and develop strategic paths forward to maximize ef-forts in fibrotic disease research. The Committee also directs NIH to include an update in its fiscal year 2019 CJ on its work relating to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis following the November 2012 NHLBI workshop, ''Strategic Planning for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fi-brosis''. Heart Disease.\u2014 The Committee is concerned that heart disease continues to impose an enormous burden on our Nation's long-term health and economic stability and directs an NIH-wide prioritization of heart research to significantly increase, expand, in-tensify, and stimulate its investment commensurate with the im-pact on public health, the economy, and innovative scientific oppor-tunities. The Committee commends NHLBI for its leadership in launching a Strategic Vision and directs the Institute to accelerate the implementation of the heart research recommendations and priorities, including heart failure and cardiac rehabilitation. 87 Hemophilia.\u2014 The Committee encourages NHLBI to bring to- gether leading hemophilia researchers and clinicians, as well as its Federal partners from CDC, FDA, and HRSA to create a national scientific agenda for clinical and translational research for the pre-vention and eradication of inhibitors, a costly complication affecting people with hemophilia. Longitudinal Study of Cardiovascular Health in African Ameri- cans. \u2014The Committee commends NHLBI for accomplishments made by its longitudinal study of cardiovascular health in African Americans. This 16-year study has provided new insights into and better understanding of the burden of cardiovascular disease among African Americans in the United States. With this increased understanding comes knowledge of the gaps in a number of other health conditions that affect African Americans disproportionally, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Additionally, research has revealed that some of these chronic conditions may have an impact on healthy aging, in-cluding cognition and risk of dementia and may have transgenerational effects. Therefore, the Committee encourages NHLBI to continue to follow-up with all current study participants, conduct broader examinations for these participants, and explore enrollment of a new group of participants, including children and grandchildren of current study participants. An expanded study will provide researchers more information about the roles of famil-ial factors and shared environments in the development and pro-gression of cardiovascular disease and other conditions. The new round of examinations should include measurements that utilize the latest technology, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, to as-sess the status of the heart, muscles, and adiposity and to evaluate structural brain changes that may be related to hypertension, dia-betes, and other chronic disorders. National Center on Sleep Disorders Research [NSCDR].\u2014 The Committee commends NHLBI and NSCDR for recent efforts to re-invigorate collaborations on important research in sleep, sleep dis-orders, and circadian rhythms. NHLBI and NSCDR are encouraged to continue to show leadership in this area and further incorporate sleep into relevant research activities across NIH Institutes and Centers. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome [POTS].\u2014 With an estimated 1,000,000 to 3,000,000 Americans suffering from POTS, a neurological disorder that affects mostly adolescent and adult women, there are no effective treatments to address this often misdiagnosed and debilitating condition. The level of disability re-sulting from POTS can be similar to that occurring in multiple sclerosis and congestive heart failure, but little research funding has been dedicated to date to improving understanding of POTS. Due to the lack of effective treatments, many patients are unable to attend school or work, resulting in significant impacts to the U.S. economy. The World Health Organization recently approved the first unique ICD code for POTS, which when implemented, will hopefully enable more precise epidemiological research on the dis-ease. The Committee expects NHLBI and NINDS to work with stakeholders to stimulate the field and develop strategies that will 88 increase our understanding of POTS and lead to effective treat- ments. Pulmonary Hypertension [PH].\u2014 The Committee applauds NHLBI for identifying the study of underlying mechanisms of dis-ease of PH as one of its areas of focus within its recent strategic vision plan for research. The Committee encourages NHLBI to con-tinue its focus in this area, particularly on idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, so that additional gains can be made that benefit patient outcomes and further improve survivability for af-fected individuals. Sickle Cell Disease.\u2014 The Committee encourages NHLBI to prioritize the study of sickle cell disease. Academic medical centers located in States with significant populations of sickle cell patients have made progress in treating the disease through NIH sponsored clinical trials and through blood and marrow transplantation for sickle cell disease, which is currently the only therapy that can cure the disease. However, more research dollars are needed to augment the limited treatment options available if we are to have a real impact on sickle cell disease. Sleep Phenotypes.\u2014 The health consequences of sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia include increased risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease and obesity. The Com-mittee is encouraged by the Institute's efforts to improve our un-derstanding of sleep disorders and urges the Institute to partner with other NIH Institutes to continue advancing research for sleep phenotypes and biomarkers that further explore health disparities and the intersection between chronic diseases and sleep. Thoracic Aortic Disease.\u2014 The Committee is concerned about sud- death caused by thoracic aortic aneurysm and dis-section attributed to structural cardiovascular disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, and encourages NHLBI to further study the mechanisms of disease and opportunities to improve patient health. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $425,751,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... Committee recommendation ................................................................. 439,738,000 The Committee recommendation includes $439,738,000 for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research [NIDCR]. Temporomandibular Disorder [TMD].\u2014 The Committee recog- nizes NIDCR's leadership in TMD pain research, which has led to establishing TMD as a multisystem disorder with overlapping pain and non-pain conditions. The Committee encourages NIDCR to con-tinue its leadership as a critical member of the Trans-NIH Working Group on Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions by promoting and advancing integrated research on these conditions. In addition, as the oral disability associated with TMD affects a patient's nutri-tional health status, the Committee encourages NIDCR to improve research on orofacial function relevant to the nutritional implica-tions of TMD. Finally, the Committee is aware of the scientific meetings on an integrated systems approach of precision medicine related to cellular-molecular-genetic-epigenetic mechanisms related to diagnosis and treatment of TMD and its comorbid conditions. In 2013, several Institutes co-sponsored a workshop on the topic of the 89 temporomandibular joint. The Committee requests an update on initiatives that resulted from the recommendations that came forth from these meetings in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,874,028,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 1,449,534,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,935,597,000 The Committee recommendation includes $1,935,597,000 for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [NIDDK]. Biomarkers. \u2014The Committee encourages NIDDK to accelerate the discovery and validation of biomarkers to aid in designing and conducting clinical trials to prevent, treat, and cure type 1 diabe-tes. The Committee also encourages NIDDK to work with NIAID to develop biomarkers specifically related to immune interventions for multiple autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes. Diabetes.\u2014 The Committee recognizes the important work of NIDDK, the lead Federal agency conducting research to find a cure for diabetes and improve diabetes care. Individuals with and at risk for diabetes benefit from life-sustaining advancements in pre- venting and treating diabetes that result from NIDDK studies. The Committee also recognizes the success of the NIDDK-supported re-search in the development of essential tools to manage diabetes, in-cluding insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors, ongoing develop-ment of artificial pancreas technologies, and new and better medi-cations to treat diabetes. The Committee urges NIDDK to commit resources commensurate with the severity and escalating costs of the epidemic to further diabetes research that will build upon these past successes, improve prevention and treatment, and bring the Nation closer to a cure. Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network [DILIN]. \u2014The Committee commends NIDDK for including analyses of liver injury caused by alternative medicines, such as herbal products and supplements, within its DILIN. However, the Committee is concerned with the limited scope of the current work. Therefore, the Committee directs NIDDK to work to expand to a broader sample of herbal products and supplements associated with liver injury cases to ascertain with greater certainty the causal agents and their prevalence. These samples exist within the DILIN Repository and afford an op-portunity to analyze products for unlabeled ingredients, along with current analyses. This work can help generate a database to help identify signals to prevent future liver injury. The Committee re-quests that NIDDK provide an update to the Committee in the fis-cal year 2019 CJ. Glomerular Diseases.\u2014 The Committee encourages continued sup- port for the Cure Glomeruloneuropathy initiative which has en-rolled over 1,500 clinical research participants to further the under-standing of rare forms of kidney diseases. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases [IBD].\u2014 The Committee is pleased by NIDDK's support of research into inflammatory bowel diseases. The Committee urges NIDDK to respond to these findings by pro-viding additional support for research on IBD. Research should in-90 clude a focus on the environmental triggers and epigenetics of IBD as well as interventions for the rising prevalence of IBD. The re-search should also be targeted at both pediatric and adult patients. Interstitial Cystitis.\u2014 The Committee is pleased with the evolving research on interstitial cystitis and encourages NIDDK to work with stakeholders on a comprehensive scientific conference to ex-amine mechanisms for scientific opportunity. Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain [MAPP].\u2014 The Committee is pleased with the progress of the MAPP Research Network and encourages collaborations with stakeholders to ensure proper dissemination of information. National Commission on Digestive Disease Research.\u2014 The Com- mittee continues to value and support the implementation of the 2009 National Commission on Digestive Disease Research report entitled ''Opportunities & Challenges in Digestive Diseases.'' The Committee requests an update on the implementation of the rec-ommendations of the National Commission. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,782,582,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 1,355,998,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,904,666,000 The Committee recommendation includes $1,904,666,000 for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS], including $43,000,000 appropriated from the NIH Innovation Ac-count. Brain Aneurysm Research.\u2014 The Committee is concerned that an estimated 1 out of every 50 individuals in the United States has a brain aneurysm and an estimated 30,000 Americans suffer a brain aneurysm rupture each year, with little to no warning. Rup-tured brain aneurysms are fatal in about 40 percent of cases. De- spite the widespread prevalence of this condition and the high soci-etal cost it imposes on our Nation, the Federal Government only spends approximately $0.83 per year on brain aneurysm research for each person afflicted with a brain aneurysm. The Committee is concerned that not enough research is focused on prevention and requests a report regarding the annual support level for brain an-eurysm research funding over the past 5 years, including the types of grants supported in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies [BRAIN] Initiative.\u2014 The Committee continues its strong support for the BRAIN Initiative and provides $400,000,000 in fiscal year 2018. The Committee commends the NIH for its leadership to date on the BRAIN Initiative and the progress made in several areas. The BRAIN Initiative is developing a more complete understanding of brain function and has the possibility of helping millions of peo-ple who suffer from a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and traumatic brain injury. Powerful new tech-nologies and tools are allowing for the study of anatomical and functional abnormalities in neuro-psychiatric diseases, which is the key to understanding these diseases and developing therapies and cures. 91 Cerebral Palsy [CP].\u2014 The Committee commends NINDS for de- veloping Strategic Plan and urges NINDS to imple-ment Funding Opportunity Announcements in support of the top priorities and increase its CP research efforts for prevention, treat-ment, and cure through the lifespan. The Committee encourages funding for basic and translational research (including regenerative medicine) for improved outcomes for patients with CP, and rec-ommends collaboration with the research and advocacy community. Furthermore, the Committee recommends that NIH form a trans- NIH working group of program officers who manage their Insti-tute's CP portfolio and that this group regularly interact with CP patient advocacy groups. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.\u2014 The Committee is aware of stakeholder efforts to achieve validated and qualified biomarkers for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The Committee supports these activities and urges NINDS to work with other Institutes and with the FDA to provide the necessary guidance and to assemble a workshop of all stakeholders to advance this work. The Committee is also concerned about a lack of access to federally funded data, such as imaging and biomarker data, that could support qualifica-tion of an MRI imaging biomarker and directs NIH to ensure all federally funded investigators, including Duchenne investigators, are in full compliance with the data sharing requirements included in the 21st Century Cures Act. Dystonia .\u2014The Committee encourages NINDS to continue to ex- pand the dystonia research portfolio. NINDS is encouraged to work with stakeholders in support of a conference to examine evolving scientific opportunities in dystonia research and to foster sharing of resources and collaboration among investigators. Parkinson's Disease .\u2014The Committee commends NINDS for tak- ing critical steps in identifying priority research recommendations to advance research on Parkinson's disease, which impacts between 500,000 and 1,500,000 Americans and is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the United States. The ultimate suc-cess of these recommendations will depend upon targeted research initiatives and increased research capacity, even if innovative sup-port and funding mechanisms are required. The Committee recog-nizes that NINDS is prioritizing public health concerns with severe gaps in unmet medical needs and believes any funding increase for NINDS in fiscal year 2018 should include support for the research recommendations set forth by the NINDS planning strategy to bring us closer to better treatments and a cure for Parkinson's dis-ease. The Committee also encourages NINDS to submit a report of its progress on implementing these recommendations at the conclu-sion of fiscal year 2018. Peripheral Neuropathies.\u2014 The Committee is pleased at the progress of ongoing research into Guillain-Barre syndrome [GBS], chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and related conditions, and notes the important connection between Zika and GBS. The Committee encourages NINDS to continue work to ad-vance emerging research in a meaningful way. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome [POTS].\u2014 With an estimated 1,000,000 to 3,000,000 Americans suffering from POTS, a neurological disorder that affects mostly adolescent and adult 92 women, there are no effective treatments to address this often misdiagnosed and debilitating condition. The level of disability re-sulting from POTS can be similar to that occurring in multiple sclerosis and congestive heart failure, but little research funding has been dedicated to date to improving understanding of POTS. Due to the lack of effective treatments, many patients are unable to attend school or work, resulting in significant impacts to the U.S. economy. The World Health Organization recently approved the first unique ICD code for POTS, which when implemented, will hopefully enable more precise epidemiological research on the dis-ease. The Committee expects NIHLBI and NINDS to work with stakeholders to stimulate the field and develop strategies that will increase our understanding of POTS and lead to effective treat-ments. Stroke.\u2014 The Committee is concerned that stroke continues to enact a massive burden on our Nation's long-term health and eco-nomic stability, and encourages NIH to expand its investment com-mensurate with the impact on public health, the economy, and in-novative scientific opportunities. NINDS shall continue to imple-ment top priorities identified in the 2012 planning initiative for stroke prevention, treatment, and recovery research, particularly augmentation of the Stroke Clinical Trials Network, including early stroke recovery. The Committee lauds the NINDS for its lead-ership in convening a workshop on ''Translational Stroke Research: Vision and Opportunities'' and directs the Institute to accelerate implementation of key recommendations and other findings. Traumatic Brain Injuries [TBI].\u2014 The Committee understands regenerative medicine research and the use of adult stem cells may play an important role in the treatment of TBI. The Committee strongly encourages NINDS, with other Institutes and Centers, to ensure a robust and coordinated portfolio of TBI research is sup-ported with a focus on how to leverage regenerative medicine re-search and the use of adult stem cells in the treatment of TBI. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on efforts in these specific areas of TBI research. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $4,916,346,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 3,782,670,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 5,127,866,000 The Committee recommendation includes $5,127,866,000 for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID]. Autoimmune Neuropathies .\u2014The Committee encourages NIAID to work with NINDS and other Institutes and Centers to support efforts to gauge the state-of-the-science of autoimmune neuropathies research into conditions like Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and to establish a cross-cutting research plan for this portfolio. Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria [CARB]. \u2014The Com- mittee remains deeply concerned about the threat posed by the in-creasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In fiscal years 2016 and 2017, NIAID used funding appropriated by the Com-mittee to expand its support for basic, translational, and applied research on antibiotic-resistant pathogens and the molecular mech-93 anisms of antimicrobial resistance. The Committee strongly sup- ports NIAID's efforts to continue these efforts, and includes $513,000,000, an increase of $50,000,000, to fund clinical trials of new antibiotics and novel uses of licensed antibiotics meant to limit the development of antibiotic resistance, as well as the develop-ment of diagnostics to quickly identify bacterial pathogens to in-form antibacterial stewardship. These funds will also make it pos-sible for NIAID to partner with Federal, academic, and industry re-searchers to develop diagnostics, immunoprophylactics, thera-peutics, and vaccines that target multiple antibiotic-resistant bac-teria. The Committee encourages NIH to continue to expand its col-laboration with USDA and CDC to increase our understanding of antibiotic resistance and improve the responsible use of antibiotics in agriculture. The Committee requests an update on these activi-ties in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Hepatitis B [HBV].\u2014 The Committee notes that infection with HBV is a serious public health threat and is associated with ap-proximately 887,000 deaths each year worldwide, making it a lead-ing cause of death in the world. In the United States, 1 in 20 Americans has been infected with HBV and up to 2,200,000 are chronically infected. Left undiagnosed and untreated, 1 in 4 of those with chronic HBV infection will die prematurely from cir-rhosis, liver failure, and/or liver cancer. In light of this public health threat, the Committee is concerned that NIH research spending on HBV research was only $49,000,000 in 2016 and has declined by almost 16 percent since fiscal year 2011. With Hepa-titis C now curable and study of the entire HBV life cycle now pos-sible, NIAID is urged to intensify its current efforts to find a cure for HBV. To meet this goal, the Committee urges NIAID to issue targeted calls for HBV research proposals in fiscal year 2018 fo-cused upon therapeutic development and the many research oppor-tunities identified by the scientific community. Lyme Disease .\u2014With more than 300,000 Americans suffering from Lyme disease, especially in rural States across the United States, an improved understanding and treatment of the disease is essential for the health and well-being of Americans. The Com-mittee encourages NIH to issue requests for grant applications for research to investigate causes of all forms and manifestations of Lyme disease, including post-treatment symptoms, as well as re-search to develop diagnostics, preventions, and treatments for those conditions and for complications caused by co-infection by other tick-transmitted bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The Com-mittee notes that in patients who suffer from long-term complica-tions associated with Lyme disease, clear treatment pathways are often missed as a result of inaccurate and incomplete testing. The Committee urges the NIAID, in coordination with CDC, to study the long-term effects on patients suffering from post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or ''chronic Lyme disease.'' Specifically, the Committee urges NIAID to evaluate the effectiveness of labora-tory tests associated with the detection of Borrelia burgdorferi to diagnose the disease early, which can improve the treatment of pa-tients suffering from chronic Lyme disease. The Committee also en-courages the National Library of Medicine, in coordination with NIAID, to update its terminology in line with new research to more 94 accurately reflect the long-term effects of chronic Lyme disease. The Committee requests that NIH report on its Lyme disease pro-gram. The report should include: (1) A summary of ongoing or up-coming efforts to advance more sensitive and accurate diagnostic tests capable of distinguishing between active and past infection, including an analysis of obstacles hindering adoption of direct de-tection tests for Lyme disease that are currently available or in the pipeline; (2) An assessment of the science on persistent infection following antibiotic treatment, with a review of recent research on biofilms and persistent forms of Lyme bacteria that can tolerate standard antibiotic treatment; (3) A summary of NIH research on prevention of Lyme disease and related tick-borne diseases, infor-mation on the effectiveness of currently available methods for pre-vention, and a description of methods for prevention NIH plans to further investigate; and (4) Details on progress achieving NIH Strategic Plan objectives relevant to Lyme disease as well as plans to address any shortfalls in meeting goals. Malaria.\u2014 The Committee urges NIAID to continue its efforts to understand the biology of the malaria parasite and to develop tools needed for effective and sustainable malaria prevention, treatment, and control, including vaccines. Sexually Transmitted Diseases [STDs].\u2014 The Committee is aware of the most recent STD Surveillance Report that found that the total combined reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis reached a record high and that the CDC estimates 20,000,000 new STDs occur every year. The Committee encourages NIAID to work in collaboration with CDC to develop effective strategies for preven-tion and treatment approaches, including vaccine development, to combat STDs, and to increase research to understand the evolution and structure of STDs and the inter-relationship with HIV/AIDS to better control for these diseases. Translational Vaccinology.\u2014 The Committee notes a very prom- ising area in the field of vaccine and immunology is translational vaccinology, in which researchers use innovative principles of vac-cine design and enhancement to generate novel, experimental vac-cines suitable for assessment and development through pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The Committee strongly encourages NIAID to support a robust portfolio of extramural, highly meri-torious translational vaccine research that focus on an interdiscipli-nary approach to this research. The Committee requests NIAID provide an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on expansion opportu-nities for interdisciplinary translational vaccinology research. Vector-borne Disease.\u2014 The Committee continues to support NIAID's ongoing research on a variety of vector-borne diseases in-cluding Zika, chikungunya, and dengue, and the Institute's of effective countermeasures and strategies. The Com-mittee supports NIAID developing new and expanded research ef-forts to enhance the array of innovative vector control technologies to counter transmission of Zika and other vector-borne infectious disease threats. Zika-Related Conditions.\u2014 The Committee encourages NIAID, along with other Institutes and Centers, to establish cross-cutting research activities to combat Zika-related conditions, including Guillain-Barre \u00b4syndrome. 95 NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $2,650,128,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 2,185,509,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,887,194,000 The Committee recommendation includes $2,887,194,000 for the National Institute of General Medical Sciences [NIGMS], which in-cludes $1,074,443,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act. Institutional Development Award [IDeA]. \u2014The Committee pro- vides $344,313,000 for the IDeA program, an increase of $10,952,000. The Committee believes the IDeA program has made significant contributions to biomedical research and has led to the creation of a skilled workforce and made the program an essential component of NIH's research portfolio. The Committee supports this important investment, which extends NIH's reach nationwide. Further, the Committee recognizes the importance of the Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence and the IDeA Networks of Bio-medical Research Excellence programs and expects funding to be maintained for both. These programs are essential to the overall success of the program. Science Education Partnership Awards [SEPA] .\u2014SEPA fosters important connections between biomedical researchers and K-12 teachers and their students. These connections establish an edu-cation pipeline to careers in biomedical sciences, which is one of the most important areas of workforce development for the U.S. econ-omy. SEPA has been level funded for a number of years and the Committee encourages NIGMS to provide additional resources for the program within their general increase for fiscal year 2018. Ad-ditional funding should be used to award additional innovative K- 12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics educational projects. EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,379,684,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 1,032,029,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,426,092,000 The Committee recommendation includes $1,426,092,000 for the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD]. Congenital Syphilis.\u2014 The Committee urges the NICHD to co- ordinate efforts with NIAID and CDC to identify potential risk fac-tors, increase prevention, improve newborn screening techniques, and provide treatment to improve outcomes in women and infants infected with Syphilis, with special focus on infants infected with HIV and Congenital Syphilis. Fragile X [FX].\u2014 The Committee commends NIH for the NICHD- led effort that has resulted in significant progress in mapping the molecular, physiological, biological, and genetic connections among Fragile X, the FX protein, and autism. Given the inextricable con-nection between the FX protein and autism, the Committee urges the Director and his counterparts at each Institute with Fragile X and autism portfolios to explore ways to create greater efficiency 96 and synergy between these two research tracks to accelerate translational research toward a better understanding of both condi-tions and to shorten the time to bring effective treatments for both conditions to market. Population Research.\u2014 The NICHD Population Dynamics Branch fosters scientific understanding of changes in human health and development at the population level by supporting research and re-search training in demography, especially through the Population Dynamics Centers Research Infrastructure Program, which pro-motes efficient use of research funding, innovative research, data sharing, and the development of young scientists. The Branch also spurs scientific innovation in demographic, or population, research by wisely investing in large-scale longitudinal studies, including the Fragile Families and Child Well Being study and the National Survey of Family Growth, the latter which revealed the decline of unintended pregnancies in the United States. The Committee urges NICHD to sustain its investment in the full spectrum of population research activities to advance our understanding of how the demog-raphy and health of our Nation are fundamentally intertwined. Sports Related Head Impact Research.\u2014 The Committee is con- cerned about the growing prevalence of head impacts, concussion, and the associated risk of concussive morbidities among partici-pants in youth sports. The Committee strongly encourages NICHD to bolster pediatric sports-related concussion research, including in-vesting in research focused on behavioral interventions and other preventative strategies that can reduce head impacts and concus-sion among young athletes. NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $732,855,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 549,847,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 758,552,000 The Committee recommendation includes $758,552,000 for the National Eye Institute [NEI]. Age-Related Macular Degeneration [AMD].\u2014 The Committee rec- ognizes NEI-funded research in which combinations of FDA-ap-proved drugs used to treat a variety of conditions from lowering blood pressure to treating prostate disease may eventually offer an option for preventing vision loss associated with degeneration of cells in the retina from AMD and Stargardt disease, the most com-mon form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Discovering new uses for these already-approved drugs\u2014which act on G protein coupled receptors, a family of signaling proteins in various cell types throughout the body\u2014provides the quickest possible transi-tion from bench to bedside. Audacious Goals Initiative [AGI].\u2014 The Committee commends NEI's leadership through its AGI, which aims to restore vision within the next decade through regeneration of the retina by re-placing cells that have been damaged by disease and injury and re-storing their visual connections to the brain. The Committee is pleased that NEI has proceeded with two rounds of grants to date that relate to novel imaging technologies to help clinicians observe the function of individual neurons in human patients and follow them over time as they test new therapies, as well as identifying 97 new factors that control regeneration and comparing the regenera- tive process among model organisms, rodents, and non-human pri-mates. Glaucoma.\u2014 The Committee recognizes the identification of three new genes by the NEI Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database [NEIGHBORHOOD] Con-sortium that are strongly associated with primary open-angle glau-coma [POAG], the most common form of the disease. The finding that variants of these genes may alter the protection of the optic nerve from degeneration due to oxidative stress increases the total number of genes associated with POAG to 15, demonstrating that the underlying mechanisms of the disease may involve the inter-action of many genes with environmental influences. Usher Syndrome.\u2014 The Committee continues to urge NIH to prioritize Usher syndrome research at NEI and NIDCD. The Com-mittee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. The update should include efforts to stimulate the field and to accelerate viable human treatment options for those with Usher syndrome. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $714,261,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 533,537,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 737,727,000 The Committee recommendation includes $737,727,000 for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [NIEHS]. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $2,052,487,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 1,303,541,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,535,539,000 The Committee recommendation includes $2,535,539,000 for the National Institute on Aging [NIA]. Alzheimer's Disease.\u2014 The bill includes $1,828,000,000, an in- above fiscal year 2017 for high-quality re-search on Alzheimer's disease, subject to the scientific opportunity presented in the peer review process. The Committee commends NIA for its leadership in supporting longitudinal, population-based cohort studies into the causes of dementia. Because rural, poor, and minority populations may be at enhanced risk for dementia, the value and application of these studies is enhanced when they in-clude individuals from various geographic, ethnic, socio-economic, and generational backgrounds. Therefore, the Committee directs NIA to diversify its cohort studies, with the specific goal of cap- turing a diverse sample of Americans whose inclusion would pro-mote a better understanding of the factors underlying variation and disparities in dementia risk and ultimately lead to improved diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies in high risk popu-lations. Population Research.\u2014 The Committee recognizes the Institute's leadership in making data, especially longitudinal data, available to the broader research community. NIA's investments in data in-frastructure, such as the ground-breaking Health and Retirement Study [HRS], have spurred significant scientific research findings as well as important interagency and international collaborations. 98 In fiscal year 2018, the Committee urges NIA and SSA to continue working jointly to support the HRS. The Committee also encour-ages the Institute to consider recommendations recently issued by an outside expert Committee regarding NIA's major surveys and to adopt innovations that will enhance data quality and accessibility. The Committee also urges NIA to pursue data collection and dis-semination and research activities via its support of the prestigious Centers of Demography and Economics of Aging. Sleep Health and Alzheimer's.\u2014 The Committee recognizes that poor sleep health and sleep disorders promote or influence the de-velopment of diseases that impair cognitive functioning, such as Alzheimer's. The Committee encourages research to explore the linkages between the sleep cycle, cardiovascular system, and Alz-heimer's in an effort to inform prevention. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $557,851,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 417,898,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 576,178,000 The Committee recommendation includes $576,178,000 for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Dis- eases [NIAMS]. Epidermolysis Bullosa. \u2014The Committee recognizes the prom- ising scientific gains and applauds private partners advancing re-search in pursuit of treatments for Epidermolysis Bullosa. The Committee encourages NIH to continue to support the intensifica-tion of such research at NIAMS. The Committee further encour-ages NIAMS to leverage Federal funds with public-private partner-ships in the areas of Epidermolysis Bullosa and related disorders. Scleroderma. \u2014The Committee applauds NIAMS for its support of research into diseases that cause fibrosis in various organ sys-tems, such as scleroderma. The Committee encourages NIAMS to prioritize research in this area and pursue collaborative opportuni-ties with other ICs investigating fibrotic diseases. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $436,875,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 325,846,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 451,768,000 The Committee recommendation includes $451,768,000 for the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Dis-orders [NIDCD]. Usher Syndrome.\u2014 The Committee continues to urge the NIH to prioritize Usher syndrome research at NEI and NIDCD. The Com-mittee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. The update should include efforts to stimulate the field and to accelerate viable human treatment options for those with Usher syndrome. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $150,273,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 113,688,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 155,210,000 99 The Committee recommendation includes $155,210,000 for the National Institute of Nursing Research [NINR]. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $483,525,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 361,356,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 500,491,000 The Committee recommendation includes $500,491,000 for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA]. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,073,320,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 864,998,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,113,442,000 The Committee recommendation includes $1,113,442,000 for the National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA]. Adolescent Brain Development [ABCD] .\u2014The Committee recog- nizes and supports the ABCD study. This study will help the un-derstanding of the dramatic brain development that takes place during adolescence and how the various experiences people are ex-posed to during this time interact with each other and their biology to affect brain development and, ultimately, social, behavioral, health, and other outcomes. The Committee requests an update be included in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on the ABCD study. Barriers to Research.\u2014 The Committee is concerned that restric- tions associated with Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substance Act effectively limit the amount and type of research that can be con-ducted on certain schedule 1 drugs, especially marijuana or its component chemicals and certain synthetic drugs. At a time when we need as much information as possible about these drugs, we need to review lowering regulatory and other barriers to conducting this research. The Committee directs NIDA to provide an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on the barriers to research that result from the classification of drugs and compounds as Schedule 1 sub-stances. Drug Treatment in Justice System Settings.\u2014 The Committee un- derstands that providing evidence-based treatment for substance use disorders offers the best alternative for interrupting the drug use/criminal justice cycle for offenders with drug problems. Un-treated substance-using offenders are more likely to relapse into drug use and criminal behavior, jeopardizing public health and safety and taxing criminal justice system resources. Treatment has consistently been shown to reduce the costs associated with lost productivity, crime, and incarceration caused by drug use. The Committee applauds NIDA's focus on adult and juvenile justice populations in its research, supports this important work, and asks for a progress report in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. National Testing Program for Schedule I Marijuana-Derived Products in U.S. Distribution. \u2014The Committee appreciates NIDA's work in marijuana research, but is concerned that NIDA ceased funding for analysis of marijuana samples seized by law enforce-ment in 2014. Without dedicated funding for this activity, the num-ber of analyzed seized samples has plummeted, meaning that avail-able data is no longer current or robust. The Committee believes 100 that such research, along with analysis of marijuana and mari- juana-derived products sold commercially in dispensaries or online, is essential for informing substance abuse prevention efforts, public health policy, and law enforcement tactics across the Federal Gov-ernment. Therefore, the Committee directs NIDA to work with law enforcement, including the Drug Enforcement Agency, to facilitate and ultimately fund a National Testing Program for Schedule I Marijuana-Derived Products in U.S. distribution to conduct such analysis of both samples seized by law enforcement and of samples collected from non-DEA approved sources to provide robust reliable data that can inform policy. Opioid Misuse and Addiction. \u2014The Committee continues to be extremely concerned about the epidemic of prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioid use, addiction, and overdose in the United States. Approximately 144 people die each day in this coun-try from opioid overdose, making it one of the most common causes of non-disease-related deaths for adolescents and young adults. This crisis has been exacerbated by the availability of fentanyl and its analogs in many communities. The Committee appreciates the important role that research can and should play in the various Federal initiatives aimed at this crisis. Although NIDA has studied the effectiveness and risks associated with long-term opioid use for chronic pain, little research has been done to investigate new and alternative treatment options. The Committee urges NIDA to ex-pand scientific activities related to research on medications used to treat and reduce chronic pain. The Committee encourages NIDA to coordinate with the agencies of the NIH Pain Consortium, the pharmaceutical industry, experts in the field of pain research and addiction, and the medical research community at large to identify gaps in scientific research related to opioid abuse and addiction, and the treatment of chronic pain, especially the development of medications with reduced abuse liability. NIDA is encouraged, as appropriate, to work with private companies to fund innovative re-search into such medications and to sponsor research to better un-derstand the effects of long-term prescription opioid use, especially as it relates to the prevention and treatment of opioid abuse and addiction. Finally, the Committee also requests an update for the NIH's plan of action to implement Section 108 of the Comprehen-sive Addiction and Recovery Act, directing the NIH to consider rec-ommendations made by the Interagency Pain Research Coordi-nating Committee in concert with the Pain Management Best Prac-tices Inter-Agency Task Force, and in accordance with the National Pain Strategy, the Federal Pain Research Strategy, and the NIH- Wide Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2016-2020, the latter of which calls for the relative burdens of individual diseases and medical disorders to be regarded as crucial considerations in balancing the priorities of the Federal research portfolio. Raising Awareness and Engaging the Medical Community in Drug Abuse and Addiction Prevention and Treatment. \u2014Education is a critical component of any effort to curb drug use and addiction, and it must target every segment of society, including healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, dentists, and pharmacists), patients, and families. Medical professionals must be in the forefront of ef-forts to curb the opioid crisis. The Committee continues to be 101 pleased with the NIDAMeD initiative, targeting physicians-in- training, including medical students and resident physicians in pri-mary care specialties (i.e., internal medicine, family practice, and pediatrics). NIDA should continue its efforts in this space, pro-viding physicians and other medical professionals with the tools and skills needed to incorporate drug abuse screening and treat-ment into their clinical practices. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,608,212,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 1,244,901,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,724,568,000 The Committee recommendation includes $1,724,568,000 for the National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], including $43,000,000 appropriated from the NIH Innovation Account. Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD] .\u2014The Committee encourages NIH's continued funding of ASD research. The estimated lifetime cost of supporting an individual with autism and intellectual dis-ability is $2,400,000, and the cost of supporting an individual with autism without intellectual disability is $1,400,000. Based on these estimates, the yearly cost of ASD to the United States is $236,000,000,000. Medicaid covers autism treatments for nearly half of all children with autism and pays for the majority of resi-dential and day programs serving adults with developmental dis-abilities. NIH-funded research presents an opportunity to mitigate the disabling effects of autism and reduce the Federal costs associ-ated with it in the future for children and adults. Tick-Borne Diseases .\u2014Lyme disease and other tick-borne dis- eases are known to cause a wide range of psychiatric manifesta-tions. Published research has shown a higher prevalence of anti-bodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in psychiatric patients than in healthy subjects. Other tick-borne diseases, such as Bartonella have also been reported to cause neurological and neurocognitive dysfunction, as well as causing agitation, panic disorder, and treat-ment resistant depression. It is therefore plausible that a certain number of cases of severe psychiatric presentations are due to un-derlying infections, especially since Lyme disease is the number one spreading vector-borne disease in the world. To further inves-tigate this hypothesis, the Committee urges NIMH to review the published literature on links between tick-borne diseases and psy-chiatric illnesses, and provide an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 399,622,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 546,934,000 The Committee recommendation includes $546,934,000 for the National Human Genome Research Institute [NHGRI]. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $357,777,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 282,614,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 371,151,000 102 The Committee recommendation includes $371,151,000 for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering [NIBIB]. In Silico Clinical Trials. \u2014The Committee appreciates the work of NIBIB in facilitating technology to move the science of in silico clinical trials forward. The Committee directs NIBIB to continue and expand this work and to involve other relevant Institutes in furthering this effort. Traumatic Brain Injury. \u2014Neurotrauma is the umbrella term for two primary pathologies, spinal cord injuries and traumatic brain injuries. These injuries are unique in that they affect how we are and who we are, with incredible variation between patients. The sizable incidence of injury and prevalence of disability resulting from neurotrauma results in significant human and economic bur-den. As befits the complexity of the challenges from neurotrauma, multiple NIH Institutes and Centers coordinate research, which ranges across a wide spectrum, from understanding the cellular mechanisms of immediate and delayed damage, though develop-ment of better prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation, and en-gages scientists, engineers, and clinicians from a broad range of disciplines. The Committee recognizes the need for cross-discipli- nary collaboration to meet these challenges and strongly encour-ages NIH to support such research through all appropriate support mechanisms. NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $134,689,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... Committee recommendation ................................................................. 139,654,000 The Committee recommendation includes $139,654,000 for the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health [NCCIH]. Non-Pharmacological Approaches to Pain Management. \u2014The Committee is encouraged by the ongoing collaboration between NCCIH, VA, DOD, and other Institutes across the NIH to develop and test efficacious non-pharmacological approaches to pain man-agement and comorbidities\u2014including opioid misuse, abuse, and disorder\u2014in military personnel, veterans, and their families. As opioid prescribing rates have increased at the VA in recent years, and opioid abuse has risen among young veterans, the Committee believes it is critical that we support research on non-pharma-cological treatments to ensure the best quality of care for our Na-tion's veterans and servicemembers, and urges the NIH, VA, and DOD to continue this vital research. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (Public Law 114-198) calls for an expansion of research and education on and delivery of complimentary and inte-grative health to veterans, and the NCCIH can play an important role in coordinating efforts with the VA, DOD, and other relevant Federal agencies. Translational Science of Natural Products. \u2014The FDA has opened new pathways for development and testing of botanical compounds for medical applications, advancing complementary and integrative health through the use of natural products and their derivatives in treating disease. The Committee directs the NCCIH to consider the 103 use of natural products in its research portfolio with the goal of speeding the development and testing of natural products and their derivatives. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $288,312,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 214,723,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 297,784,000 The Committee recommendation includes $297,784,000 for the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities [NIMHD]. African American Males and Mental Health.\u2014 The Committee is concerned with the prevalence of mental health issues which go undiagnosed, especially in African American males. Despite devel-opments to diagnose and treat conditions, stigma allows many to go without the help that is needed. The Committee encourages the NIMH to work collaboratively with community partners to develop treatments for the populations that are in need. Center of Excellence [COE] in Health Disparities. \u2014The Com- mittee has identified a need for additional research into the vary-ing social, biological, economic, and cultural factors that contribute to health disparities between racial groups. The rates of premature death from stroke and coronary heart disease are higher among Af-rican Americans than among Whites. African Americans have high-er rates of diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease than other groups. Additionally, African Americans experience higher mor-tality rates from many cancers. Minorities are underrepresented in clinical trials and are less likely to survive prostate cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer than their White counterparts. The Com-mittee requests a written report on NIMHD's COEs within 120 days of enactment of this act. Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis [FSGS]. \u2014The Committee en- courages NIMHD to continue research collaboration with NIDDK to address the connection between the APOL1 gene and the onset of FSGS. Research Centers in Minority Institutions [RCMI]. \u2014The Com- mittee continues to recognize the critical role played by minority institutions, especially at the graduate level, in addressing the health research and training needs of minority populations. In par-ticular, the RCMI program fosters the development of new genera-tions of minority scientists for the Nation and provides support for crucial gaps in the biomedical workforce pipeline, with each dollar invested being leveraged to generate an additional five to six dol-lars in competitive research funding. The RCMI program has the capability to promote solutions to the significant gap in R01 grant funding among black and other minority researchers when com-pared to non-minority researchers. The Committee expects NIMHD to engage stakeholders and the Committee if any changes to the RCMI program are being considered, and prior to any Funding Op-portunity Announcement release. Research Endowment Program. \u2014The Committee commends NIMHD for its unique Research Endowment Program, funding to help institutions build research infrastructure and recruit, train, and maintain a diverse student body and faculty. The Committee 104 remains concerned that NIMHD changed the eligibility require- ments for the program without community consultation in the FOA released June 4, 2015. However, the Committee is encouraged that in April 2017 NIMHD established a special workgroup composed of representatives from its Advisory Council and the broader commu-nity to review eligibility. The Committee requests that the workgroup undertake a thorough review, including a review of the maximum endowment qualification limits, and provide rec-ommendations on how to evaluate the program and consider eligi-bility criteria, given the program is now in its 17th year. The Com-mittee requests that NIMHD submit the results of the delibera-tions and the recommendations to the Committee prior to NIMHD issuing the next FOA, no later than 120 days after enactment of this act. JOHN E . FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCED STUDY IN THE HEALTH SCIENCES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $72,014,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... ........................... Committee recommendation 74,380,000 The Committee recommendation includes $74,380,000 for the Fogarty International Center [FIC]. The Committee recommendation maintains support for FIC, which coordinates global health research and training conducted by U.S. and international investigators, and helps build relationships between health research institutions here and abroad. During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, Fogarty graduates played an important role in efforts to contain the spread of virus in Nige-ria and Mali, where Fogarty has invested for decades in research training. FIC is now focused on strengthening institutions in Guin-ea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, countries that possessed little sci-entific expertise before the pandemic and consequently suffered the most. The Committee directs NIH to provide an update on these ef-forts in its fiscal year 2019 CJ. NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $407,510,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 373,258,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 420,898,000 The Committee recommends $420,898,000 for the National Li- brary of Medicine [NLM]. Of the funds provided, $4,000,000 is for the improvement of information systems, to remain available until September 30, 2019. NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $705,903,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... Committee recommendation ................................................................. 729,094,000 The Committee recommendation includes $729,094,000 for the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [NCATS]. The Committee includes bill language allowing up to $24,496,593 of this amount to be used for the Cures Acceleration Network [CAN]. 105 Clinical and Translational Science Awards [CTSA] Program .\u2014 The Committee includes $533,076,000, an increase of $16,956,000, for the CTSA Program. The Committee is deeply concerned about NCATS' management of the CTSA program. The Committee has provided robust support for the CTSA program over the past sev-eral years and NCATS appears to be both ignoring congressional intent regarding the number of CTSA hubs as well as attempting to erode financial support for the hubs. Specifically, the Committee rejects the recent move to reduce some CTSA awards from a 5 year grant cycle to 4 years. Prior notification or justification of this sig-nificant change was not provided to the Committee, the CTSA com-munity, or in any written document. The Committee expects NCATS to rectify this change immediately and directs all awards made in fiscal year 2017 and moving forward to be for 5 years. In addition, the Committee strongly supports efforts by NIH to train the next generation of biomedical researchers by supporting key training programs like the ''K'' and ''T'' awards. As stated in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine report in 2013, the CTSA program should build on these and other innova-tive training and education programs that are helping to bridge the gap between the basic and clinical sciences. Further, the Com-mittee is concerned NCATS is considering changing CTSA's con-figuration and funding structure without adequate congressional notification or stakeholder input. Therefore, the Committee directs NCATS to maintain the existing support structure, including main-taining the number of CTSA hub awards at no less than the fiscal year 2016 level, and to continue funding CTSA hub awards for 5 years. NCATS is directed to provide an update to the Committee no later than 120 days after enactment of this act on any proposed changes to the program and prior to any changes being imple-mented. In addition, the Committee expects the Director to provide quarterly updates to the principal investigators of CTSA hubs and the Committee, jointly, beginning within 30 days of enactment of this act. Finally, the Committee shall be provided written notifica-tion at least 3 days in advance of any public release of CTSA grant awards. N ATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH ON SAFETY AND QUALITY Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. ........................... Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... $272,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. ........................... The Committee recommendation does not provide funding for the National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality [NIRSQ]. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,667,610,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 1,329,833,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,796,970,000 The Committee recommendation includes $1,796,970,000 for the Office of the Director [OD]. Within this total, $575,290,000 is pro-vided for the Common Fund. The Committee moves the All of Us study from the Common Fund to OD and provides $290,000,000, an increase of $60,000,000 above fiscal year 2017. 106 Academic Research Enhancement Award [AREA] Program .\u2014The Committee believes that biomedical discoveries can occur any-where, and continues to support programs that foster biomedical research and opportunities for students at institutions who may not receive significant NIH funding. In particular, the Committee continues its long-standing support of the IDeA program. However, the Committee notes that many institutions that may benefit from the IDeA program are ineligible because they reside in States that are not IDeA States. The Committee encourages NIH to enhance support for the AREA program and is urged to develop ways to im-prove ties between institutions that receive significant NIH funding and AREA-eligible institutions. All of Us Precision Medicine Initiative .\u2014The Committee rec- ommendation supports the All of Us Precision Medicine Initiative and has provided $290,000,000 in support of this Initiative. The Committee is encouraged by the enormous potential of precision medicine for all populations, including children, since much of adult health is rooted in the earliest years. The Committee is aware that at an All of Us Research Program stakeholder briefing, NIH announced plans to develop working groups to address inclu-sion of the pediatric population and has also indicated plans to host a pediatric stakeholder convening. The Committee requests an up-date within 90 days after enactment of this act on the status and timeline for the working groups to release findings regarding pedi-atric enrollment in the All of Us Research Program and the ex- pected timeline for beginning enrollment of children from diverse backgrounds in the program. The Committee expects NIH to en-sure that the research cohort includes a sufficient number of chil-dren to make meaningful studies possible. Amyloidosis.\u2014 The Committee recommends that NIH continue to expand its research efforts into amyloidosis, a group of rare dis-eases characterized by abnormally folded protein deposits in tis-sues. Amyloidosis is often fatal and there is no known cure. Cur-rent methods of treatment are risky and unsuitable for many pa-tients. The Committee directs NIH to keep the Committee informed on the steps it takes to increase the understanding of the causes of amyloidosis and measures that improve the diagnosis and treat-ment of this devastating group of diseases. Angiogenesis .\u2014The Committee recommends that NIH study the regulation of vascular growth and its interactions with the immune system, stem cells, DNA repair, and microbiome. Further, the Com-mittee urges the NIH to research the impact of metabolism and di-etary factors on endothelial cells, specifically to support normal physiology and oppose disease, and to study biomarkers of vascular health. Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]. \u2014The Committee commends NIH for its commitment to the study of ASD recognizing that there are many different subtypes of autism and that the full range of potential treatments, appropriate to each subtype, have not yet been developed. The Committee encourages NIH to explore a col-laborative approach to gain a systematic and comprehensive under-standing of each subtype, and to translate this understanding to develop individualized treatments. Such an approach would har-ness information from academia and industry, as well as individ-107 uals and families impacted by ASD. The European Union has a similar integrated research effort underway to focus on this issue, the European Autism Interventions\u2014A Multicentre Study for De-veloping New Medications. The Committee encourages the NIH to explore this approach and provide an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Basic Molecular Science .\u2014The Committee understands basic science is the foundation of the research pyramid that support bio-medical and translational research efforts. The Committee is con-cerned with the recent decrease in the proportion of basic research. The Committee encourages NIH to expand its basic science efforts, with a specific focus on basic molecular research to increase sci-entific understanding at the molecular level in an effort to support translational molecular medicine research of tomorrow. The Com-mittee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on the per-centage of spending on basic science for the past 10 years and spe-cific efforts to promote basic research that supports molecular med-icine and regenerative medicine using induced pluripotent stem cells. Big Data Infrastructure .\u2014Biomedical research has become in- creasingly reliant on growing amounts of digital data, a develop-ment with tremendous and potentially disruptive promise if this data can be used effectively to enable major scientific break-throughs. Figuring out how to make this possible is one of the big-gest obstacles facing NIH. In 2012, NIH began an extramural pro-gram to provide a framework of pilot programs, centers of excel-lence, and grant opportunities to advance thinking in how to orga-nize, share, and use big data. NIH is using the results from these programs to inform the next phase of development of big data in-frastructure, including the ongoing Data Commons Pilot. The sec-ond phase is expected to also build off of several other major initia-tives including those in cancer, Alzheimer's disease, the human brain, and the All of Us research program. The Committee wants to ensure that these efforts are coordinated and overseen to ensure all of NIH benefits from them. In its fiscal year 2017 report, the Committee directed NIH to work with its external partners and stakeholders to provide the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate a detailed strategic plan by May 5, 2018, spelling out it how intends to make big data sus-tainable, interoperable, accessible, and usable. The plan is to in-clude a roadmap to achieve these objectives, as well as milestones and estimates of the resources that will be necessary. The Com-mittee expects to receive the strategic plan, which was first identi-fied in the Senate report dated June 9, 2016, by the May deadline. The unanticipated delay in completing the fiscal year 2017 appro-priations process means NIH will have had almost 2 years to pre-pare its plan, extra time that should make it possible to draft a comprehensive blueprint to help guide future investments in data science. In the interim, the Committee directs NIH to provide a status report in the fiscal year 2019 CJ describing the current sta-tus of the strategic plan and its progress in finding a suitable can-didate to fill the Associate Director for Data Science [ADDS] va-cancy. The Committee recognizes the importance of the ADDS to provide strategic vision and coordinate as an honest broker across 108 NIH on data science issues, and encourages NIH to locate this posi- tion within the Office of the Director. Botanical Products and Opioid Addiction. \u2014The Committee com- mends the FDA for establishing guidelines and opening pathways for Investigational New Drug [IND] applications for botanical drugs. Over the past two decades, the dramatic increase in abuse of prescription opioids, non-synthetic opioids, and illicit synthetic opioids has grown to epidemic proportions. Scientific rationale and laboratory studies suggest a decrease in addictive potential when botanical derivatives, including cannabidiol extracts, are used with an opioid in treating patients. The Committee supports study of this integrative approach to treatment and urges NIH, including NIDA, NCCIH, and OCCAM, to support and facilitate trials aimed at reducing addiction under appropriate IND applications. Brain Research through Application of Innovative Neuro-tech- nologies [BRAIN] Initiative.\u2014 The Committee continues to strongly support the BRAIN initiative. The bill provides $400,000,000 an in-crease of $140,000,000 above fiscal year 2017, to expand the initia-tive consistent with the BRAIN 2025 report issued in 2014. Children in NIH Research. \u2014The inclusion of children in clinical research is essential to ensure that children benefit from important scientific advances. The Committee appreciates provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act that will now require NIH to systemati-cally track enrollment data to determine if children are actually being enrolled appropriately in clinical research. The Committee recognizes that without better data collection and reporting it is unable to fully exercise its oversight role, and researchers and other stakeholders are unable to determine whether children as a whole, or particular pediatric subpopulations, are appropriately represented in federally funded biomedical research. The Com-mittee directs NIH to expeditiously implement these new require-ments. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [ME/CFS] .\u2014The Committee is pleased that NIH has begun to expedite research into ME/CFS, in-cluding its intramural study and the RFAs for the collaborative re-search centers. However, the Committee is concerned that the level of funding is still very low considering the burden of disease and the current plan to expand research will take too long to produce FDA-approved treatments and diagnostic tests. The Committee urges NIH to collaborate with disease experts and the patient com-munity to identify additional opportunities to expedite progress on this understudied disease. Specifically, the Committee recommends that NIH consider increasing research funding to be commensurate with disease burden and use that funding to further accelerate the research field through a set of intramural and extramural invest-ments such as: (1) RFAs for biomarkers and treatment trials, (2) additional funding for investigator initiated studies and early stage investigator awards, (3) an initiative to reach consensus on the case definition, and (4) mechanisms to incentivize researchers to enter the field. Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions. \u2014The Committee notes the strong evidence base demonstrating deleterious outcomes for pa-tients with Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions, which include hit-or-miss, ineffective, or even harmful treatments, poor health 109 and quality of life outcomes, markedly increased disability rates and personal and societal financial burdens. The Committee is pleased with NIH's efforts to develop a chronic overlapping pain conditions screening tool. However, an expanded, coordinated, and collaborative initiative is needed to maximize the Federal research investment, reduce spending, and improve clinical practice. There is an urgent need to analyze the state of science on Chronic Over-lapping Conditions, which will identify both research gaps and fu-ture research directions and collaborations. As such, the Committee urges the Director to consider the relevant recommendations of the Federal Pain Research Strategy to guide the development of a com-prehensive effort that spans the basic, translational, and clinical research continuum to advance scientific understanding of chronic overlapping pain conditions, as well as the development and dis-covery of safe and effective treatments. Facilities and Administrative Costs [F&A]. \u2014Central to the Ad- ministration's proposal to reduce Federal investments in biomedical research is its proposal to cap the F&A costs of grants, so-called ''indirect costs,'' at 10 percent. The F&A cost of a grant is intended to cover the indirect costs of biomedical research, ranging from ad-ministration and facilities to the cost of equipment shared across multiple researchers. For example, at research facilities focused on making the next breakthrough in cancer treatment, indirect costs supply the air handlers that provide the precise conditions needed to generate therapeutic T cells for immunotherapy trials, complex data systems to analyze and protect patients' genomic data, and support for the next generation of scientific leaders. The method-ology for negotiating indirect costs has been in place since 1965, and rates have remained largely stable across NIH grantees for decades. The Administration's proposal would radically change the nature of the Federal Government's relationship with the research community, abandoning the Government's long-established respon-sibility for underwriting much of the Nation's research infrastruc-ture, and jeopardizing biomedical research nationwide. The Com-mittee has not seen any details of the proposal that might explain how it could be accomplished without throwing research programs across the country into disarray. To avoid this possibility, the Com-mittee has included bill language to prohibit HHS from developing or implementing a modified approach to funding F&A costs. Fetal Tissue Donation Trial .\u2014The Committee acknowledges the many differing views on the merits of human fetal tissue research. New bill language is included to direct NIH to begin a pilot to de-termine the adequacy of a fetal tissue donor network for supporting all related clinical research from human fetal tissue donated solely from stillbirths and spontaneous abortion. Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act .\u2014The Committee pro- vides the full budget request of $12,600,000. The Committee re-quests that NIH provide information on how it has disbursed fund-ing, including any personnel that are responsible for overseeing the allocation of designated research dollars, the criteria that NIH em-ployed to ensure awards will advance the objectives of the act, and a description of the research projects that were funded in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. 110 Gestational Diabetes.\u2014 The Committee recognizes the importance of research funded by NIH related to gestational diabetes, a disease affecting up to 9.2 percent of all pregnant women. Given that both women with gestational diabetes and their babies face long-term health consequences as a result of the disease, such as increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, the Committee urges NIH to ex-plore additional opportunities for research on gestational diabetes. Government-Wide Collaborations .\u2014NIH, VA, and DOD collabo- rate frequently and successfully on various research activities. The Committee looks forward to the report in the fiscal year 2019 CJ focusing on the cooperative and strategic approach the agencies take in areas of biomedical research that overlap to maximize the potential of the research. Hepatitis B [HBV]. \u2014The Committee recognizes that HBV infec- tion is a serious public health threat. Though infection rates are less than one percent in the United States, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders experience about 60 percent of the chronic HBV burden. Left undiagnosed and untreated, one in four of those with chronic HBV infection will die prematurely from cirrhosis, liver failure, and/or liver cancer. The Committee also notes that the link between HBV infection and primary liver cancer is well estab-lished, with up to 60 percent of global liver cancer cases caused by HBV. The Committee requests that OD ensure that NCI, NIAID, NIMHD, and NIDDK coordinate their strategic research agendas to work toward finding a cure for HBV. The Committee further re-quests an update on these efforts be included in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Imaging. \u2014The Committee notes that imaging research occurs in multiple Institutes throughout the NIH and is an integral compo-nent of the Cancer Moon Shot, the Precision Medicine Initiative, and the BRAIN Initiative. The Committee requests that the Direc-tor produce an overview of imaging research across the NIH, in-cluding in the focused research fields mentioned above, and assess the quality of interactions in imaging research within NIH, and re-port the results in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell [iPSC] Technology .\u2014The Com- mittee understands that unlike the controversy linked with embry-onic stem cells, iPSCs are derived from adult skin cells making them an acceptable alternative therapeutic. iPSCs have many of the therapeutic properties of embryonic stem cells, but with the ad-ditional advantage that they can be derived from patient skin cells for personalized medicine. This establishes iPSCs as a source of cells with great value and potential for curing human disease and injury. iPSCs could potentially be used to treat a wide range of human disease, repair damaged tissue (regenerative medicine), and serve as a platform to develop new therapeutics (small molecule drugs). However, the Committee notes that additional basic re-search is essential to realize the full biomedical potential of this technology. The Committee encourages NIH to support basic re- search in this area that leads to pre-clinical trials, cures, diagnostics, and treatments. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on expansion opportunities being consid-ered related to iPSC technology. 111 Inflammatory Bowel Diseases [IBD]. \u2014The Committee is con- cerned with the increasing prevalence of IBD. The Committee urges the Director's office to utilize an overarching mechanism, such as the Common Fund, to study the cause of this increase in prevalence, including environmental triggers and epigenetics. Interagency Pain Research. \u2014Consistent with the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (Public Law 114-198), the Committee encourages the Director to intensify and coordinate fundamental, translational, and clinical research of the NIH with respect to the understanding of pain, the discovery and development of therapies for chronic pain, and the development of alternatives to opioids for effective pain treatments. In doing so, the Committee urges the NIH to consider recommendations of the Federal Pain Research Strategy. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on this initiative. Lymphatic System. \u2014The Committee supports building on the momentum of the 2015 NIH Lymphatic Symposium by growing the cadre of lymphatic researchers through the establishment of extra-mural interdisciplinary research training programs relevant to the lymphatic system in health and disease and by incorporating more reviewer expertise in lymphatic biology/disease in the pertinent standing study sections within the Center for Scientific Review. This research will be instrumental in understanding the pivotal role of the lymphatic system in the pathogenesis and/or treatment of cancer metastasis, AIDS, auto-immune diseases, obesity, cardio-vascular disease, and organ transplantation as well as those af-fected by lymphatic conditions after cancer or those with congenital conditions. Mitochondrial Disease Research .\u2014The Committee understands that no less than 17 Institutes and offices are involved in a variety research efforts related to mitochondrial disease and dysfunction. The Committee appreciates the NIH's support of the trans-NIH Mitochondrial Disorders Working Group, the North American Mitochondrial Disease Consortium, the Mitochondrial Disease Se-quence Data Resource Consortium, and its support for investigator initiated intramural and extramural studies, and urges the NIH to expand upon its November 2016 research agenda on nutritional interventions in primary mitochondrial disorders. The Committee understands that the NIH has established the Environmental in-fluences on Child Health Outcomes program, which supports longi-tudinal studies to investigate the effects of environmental expo-sures\u2014in conjunction with genetic influences\u2014on children's health and development. The Committee encourages the Director to ex-plore whether the longitudinal cohort studies included within ECHO can shed light on any of the mitochondrial diseases occur-ring in children. The Committee further encourages the Director to competitively fund basic and clinical research on mitochondrial dis-ease. Mucopolysaccharide [MPS].\u2014 MPS diseases are inherited, with death occurring for many in early childhood. This systemic disease causes progressive damage to the bones, heart, respiratory system, and brain. The Committee continues to urge NIH to put a high pri-ority on better understanding and treating MPS and mucolipidosis diseases. The Committee commends NIH for allocating funds to 112 discover, develop, define, and make available for research animal models of human genetic disease. The Committee encourages ex-panded research of treatments for neurological, chronic inflamma-tion, cardiovascular and skeletal manifestations of MPS, with an emphasis on gene therapy. The Committee thanks NINDS, NIDDK, and ORDR for funding the Lysosomal Disease Network through the Rare Disease Clinical Network and for funding lysosomal research meetings. The Committee encourages the NIH to increase funding to grantees to incentivize MPS research, par-ticularly given the aging and small population of current research-ers. Understanding the manifestations and treatments of both the skeletal and neurological disease continues to be the greatest areas of unmet need. National Laboratories.\u2014 NIH is encouraged to enter into collabo- rative research programs with the Secretary of Energy, National Laboratories, and others determined to be appropriate by the Di-rector, to utilize the broader scientific and technological capabilities of the Department of Energy [DOE] and National Laboratories. In particular, DOE and NIH should work together to support access for biomedical researchers to cutting-edge technology resources. Neurofibromatosis [NF]. \u2014The Committee supports efforts to in- crease funding and resources for NF research and treatment at multiple Institutes, including NCI, NINDS, NIDCD, NHLBI, NICHD, NIMH, NCATS, and NEI. Children and adults with NF are at significant risk for the development of many forms of cancer; the Committee encourages NCI to increase its NF research port-folio in fundamental basic science, translational research, and clin-ical trials focused on NF. The Committee also encourages NCI to support NF centers, clinical trials consortia, preclinical mouse mod-els consortia, and associated tumor sequencing efforts. Because NF causes brain and nerve tumors and is associated with cognitive and behavioral problems, the Committee urges NINDS to continue to aggressively fund fundamental basic science research on NF rel-evant to nerve damage and repair. Based on emerging findings from numerous researchers worldwide demonstrating that children with NF are at significant risk for autism, learning disabilities, motor delays, and attention deficits, the Committee encourages NINDS, NIMH, and NICHD to expand their investments in labora-tory-based and clinical investigations in these areas. Since NF2 ac-counts for approximately 5 percent of genetic forms of deafness, the Committee encourages NIDCD to expand its investment in NF2 basic and clinical research. NF1 can cause vision loss due to optic gliomas. The Committee encourages NEI to expand its investment in NF1 basic and clinical research. Next Generation Researchers Initiative .\u2014The Committee supports robust implementation of the Next Generation Researchers Initia-tive within the Office, as established in the 21st Century Cures Act, and is encouraged by NIH's continued work in this space. The Committee directs NIH to prioritize improving opportunities for our next generation of researchers by working through the Initia-tive to coordinate all current and new NIH policies to promote op-portunities for new scientists and earlier research independence, including enhancing training and mentorship programs for re-searchers, and enhancing workforce diversity. As required by the 113 21st Century Cures Act, the Committee directs NIH to consider the recommendations made by the National Academies of Science study under Public Law 114-113 in carrying out the activities of the Initiative. Pediatric Clinical Trials. \u2014The Committee supports the pediatric clinical trials conducted under the Best Pharmaceutical Practices for Children Act [BPCA], and strongly encourages the NIH to con-tinue to support this program. BPCA has made significant steps in closing the knowledge gap on the efficacy of drugs being used on children and encourages enhanced coordination of BPCA activities with other NIH pediatric research and initiatives, including, but not limited to, pediatric cancer, the pediatric MATCH study, mus-cular dystrophy, the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network Program, and the All of Us Precision Medicine Initiative. The Com- mittee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on the status of research related to this topic. Phelan-McDermid Syndrome. \u2014Phelan-McDermid Syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a partial deletion of chromosome 22 and loss of the SHANK3 gene. The Committee continues to support a multi-Institute approach to support research into Phelan- McDermid Syndrome, examining in particular the disorder's cor-relation with autism, epilepsy and other developmental disabilities. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on the status of research related to this topic. Population Health Training. \u2014The Committee acknowledges the growing understanding that the living systems that produce health and disease encompass health determinants ''from cells to society.'' The Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research should con-tinue to work with NIH Institutes and Centers to encourage inter-disciplinary population health science training to enhance our un-derstanding of how social, cultural, genetic, biological, and environ-mental factors combine to influence outcomes in health and human development. Rehabilitation Research. \u2014The Committee encourages NIH to fully implement Section 2040 of the 21st Century Cures Act to en-hance the stature, visibility, and coordination of medical rehabilita-tion research conducted at NIH. The Committee is encouraged by the release of NIH's new Rehabilitation Research Plan, looks for-ward to reviewing its first annual progress report, and is encour-aged by its ongoing efforts to ensure that reporting of rehabilitation research is consistent with the definition of ''rehabilitation re-search'' included in the legislation. Research Facilities.\u2014 Much of the Nation's biomedical research infrastructure, including laboratories and research facilities at aca-demic institutions and nonprofit research organizations, is out-dated or insufficient. For taxpayers to receive full value from their considerable investments in biomedical research, scientists must have access to appropriate research facilities. Therefore, $25,000,000 is provided for grants or contracts to public, nonprofit, and not-for-profit entities to expand, remodel, renovate, or alter ex-isting research facilities or construct new research facilities as au-thorized under 42 U.S.C. section 283k. The Committee urges NIH to consider recommendations made by the NIH Working Group on Construction of Research Facilities, including making awards that 114 are large enough to underwrite the cost of a significant portion of newly constructed or renovated facilities. Sleep Disorders. \u2014The Committee recognizes sleep disorders as a serious public health concern. Sleep disorders affects approximately 70,000,000 Americans and contribute to lost productivity, increase the risk for accidents, and are associated with other chronic ill-nesses, such as hypertension and mental health conditions. The Committee encourages the NIH to advance the work of the Na-tional Center on Sleep Disorders Research, which coordinates re-search activities across Institutes and Centers. The Committee also encourages NIH to facilitate implementation of the ongoing NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan. Spina Bifida. \u2014The Committee encourages NIA, NIDDK, NICHD, and NINDS to study the causes and care of the neurogenic bladder and kidney disease to improve the quality of life of children and adults with Spina Bifida; to support research to address issues related to the treatment of Spina Bifida and associated secondary conditions, such as hydrocephalus; and to invest in understanding the myriad co-morbid conditions experienced by individuals with Spina Bifida. Temporomandibular Disorders [TMD] .\u2014The Committee under- stands that NIH-funded research has demonstrated that temporomandibular disorders [TMD] are primarily a multisystem disorder with overlapping conditions influenced by multiple biologi-cal and environmental factors rather than solely an orofacial pain condition. However, diagnosis and care of patients have not changed to reflect this major paradigm shift, with many patients continuing to receive treatments solely focused on teeth and jaws. Moreover, the medical community lacks education regarding the complexity and systemic aspects of TMD as well as its many co-morbid medical conditions. Patients are treated by a multitude of practitioners across numerous disciplines with treatments that have the potential to cause harm. To address these issues, the Committee requests that NIH provide an update on the state of TMD research, activities related to TMD education, and clinical studies of TMD in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Trans-NIH Working Group on Fibrosis .\u2014The Committee recog- nizes that fibrosis can occur across body systems and applauds NIH for establishing a trans-NIH working group on fibrosis. The Committee encourages NIH to continue the cross-cutting coordina-tion of research between ICs in this area. Trauma Research. \u2014To ensure that our Nation's trauma response network and workforce remain adequately prepared, the Com-mittee recommends an increased focus by NIH on trauma research, including to establish a NIH-led trauma research agenda coordi-nated with the extensive, and often groundbreaking, DOD activities on trauma. This research is critical to minimize the loss of human life, disability, and injury by ensuring that patient-specific trauma care is based on scientifically validated findings. Trisomy 21.\u2014 The Committee recognizes that the presence of a third copy of human chromosome 21 may be linked to significant immune dysregulation and Alzheimer's disease, while protecting against most cancers and cardiovascular disease among individuals with Down syndrome. The Committee strongly encourages NIH to 115 pursue an initiative on this topic that will yield scientific learnings that could significantly improve the health of individuals with Down syndrome as well as millions of typical individuals. BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $128,863,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 98,615,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 128,863,000 The Committee recommendation includes $128,863,000 for NIH buildings and facilities. This funding will remain available for obli-gation for 5 years.

Regenerative Medicine. \u2014$10,000,000. The Committee report reflects distribution of the remainder of funding from the NIH Innovation Account to NCI, NINDS, and NIMH and expects NIH to transfer funding shortly after enactment of this act. S UBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION The Committee recommends $3,777,592,000 for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA]. The recommendation includes $133,667,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act and $12,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. SAMHSA is responsible for supporting mental health programs and alcohol and other drug abuse prevention and treatment serv-ices throughout the country, primarily through categorical grants and block grants to States. Eligible applicants under SAMHSA's PRNS authorities include States, political subdivisions of States, Indian Tribes or tribal orga-nizations, health facilities, or programs operated by or in accord-ance with a grant or contract with the Indian Health Service, and other public or private nonprofit entities. The Committee strongly encourages SAMHSA to exercise maximum flexibility allowed when developing funding opportunity announcements to ensure that all eligible applicants are included. The Committee recommendation continues bill language that in- structs the Administrator of SAMHSA and the Secretary to exempt the Mental Health Block Grant [MHBG] and the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment [SAPT] Block Grant from being used as a source for the PHS evaluation set-aside in fiscal year 2018. MENTAL HEALTH Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,181,037,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 912,347,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,181,037,000 116 The Committee recommends $1,181,037,000 for mental health services. The recommendation includes $21,039,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act and $12,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. Included in the recommendation is funding for programs of regional and national significance [PRNS], the MHBG, children's mental health services, Projects for Assist-ance in Transition from Homelessness [PATH], and Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness [PAIMI]. Programs of Regional and National Significance The Committee recommends $398,659,000 for PRNS within the Center for Mental Health Services [CMHS]. The Committee rec-ommendation includes $12,000,000 in transfers to PRNS from the PPH Fund. These programs address priority mental health needs by developing and applying evidence-based practices, offering train-ing and technical assistance, providing targeted capacity expansion grants, and changing the delivery system through family, client-ori-ented, and consumer-run activities. Within the total provided for PRNS, the Committee recommenda- tion includes funding for the following activities: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation CAPACITY: Seclusion & Restraint ...........................................................

Early mental health prevention, identi-fication, and treatment may reduce the need for treatment later in life when it becomes more difficult, time intensive, and expensive. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to explore opportunities to expand these efforts. Mental Health First Aid.\u2014 The Committee is pleased with the progress of Mental Health First Aid. In issuing new competitive funding opportunities SAMHSA is directed to include as eligible grantees local law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and emergency medical units with a special emphasis on training for crisis de-escalation techniques. SAMHSA is also encouraged to prioritize training for veterans, armed services personnel, and their family members within the Mental Health First Aid program. Practice Improvement and Training.\u2014 The Committee recognizes the critical need for programs such as Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers, which advance the current knowledge base of the mental health delivery system by supporting evaluation, training, technical assistance, and knowledge translation activities that help adults with serious mental health conditions achieve their life goals. Primary and Behavioral Healthcare Integration [PBHCI] .\u2014The Committee provides $49,877,000 for PBHCI to support commu-nities to coordinate and integrate primary care services into com-munity-based behavioral health settings. Project AWARE.\u2014 The Committee continues to fund Project AWARE which increases awareness of mental health issues and connects young people that have behavioral health issues and their families with needed services. Of the amount provided for Project AWARE, the Committee directs SAMHSA to use $10,000,000 for discretionary grants to support efforts in high-crime, high-poverty areas and, in particular, communities that are seeking to address relevant impacts and root causes of civil unrest. These grants should maintain the same focus as fiscal year 2017 grants. The Committee requests a report on progress of fiscal year 2017 grant-ees 180 days after the enactment of this act. Community Mental Health Services Block Grant The Committee recommends $562,571,000 for the MHBG. The recommendation includes $21,039,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act. The MHBG distributes funds to 59 eligible States and territories through a formula based on specified economic and demographic factors. Grant applications must include an annual plan for pro-viding comprehensive community mental health services to adults with a serious mental illness and children with a serious emotional disturbance. The Committee recommendation continues bill language requir- ing that at least 10 percent of the funds for the MHBG program be set-aside for evidence-based programs that address the needs of individuals with early serious mental illness, including psychotic disorders. The Committee commends SAMHSA for its collaboration 118 with NIMH on the implementation of this set-aside. The Com- mittee notes that it usually takes 14-17 years to translate research findings into practice and hopes that the joint effort between NIMH and SAMHSA may be a model for how to reduce this time-frame. The Committee directs SAMHSA to continue its collabora-tion with NIMH to ensure that funds from this set-aside are only used for programs showing strong evidence of effectiveness and that target the first episode of psychosis. SAMHSA shall not ex-pand the use of the set-aside to programs outside of the first epi-sode psychosis. The Committee directs SAMHSA to include in the fiscal year 2019 CJ a detailed table showing at a minimum each State's allotment, name of the program being implemented, and a short description of the program. Children's Mental Health Services The Committee recommends $119,026,000 for the Children's Mental Health Services program. This program provides grants and technical assistance to support comprehensive, community- based systems of care for children and adolescents with serious emotional, behavioral, or mental disorders. Grantees must provide matching funds and services must be coordinated with the edu-cational, juvenile justice, child welfare, and primary healthcare sys-tems. The Committee includes a 10 percent set-aside for an early intervention demonstration program with persons not more than 25 years of age at clinical high risk of developing a first episode psychosis. SAMHSA is directed to work with NIMH on the imple-mentation of this set-aside. Projects for Assistance in Transition From Homelessness The Committee recommends $64,635,000 for PATH, which ad- dresses the needs of individuals with serious mental illness who are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of homelessness. Funds are used to provide an array of services, such as screening and diagnostic services, emergency assistance, case management, and referrals to the most appropriate housing environment. Protection and Advocacy for Individuals With Mental Illness The Committee recommends $36,146,000 for PAIMI. This pro- gram helps ensure that the rights of mentally ill individuals are protected while they are patients in all public and private facilities or while they are living in the community, including in their own homes. Funds are allocated to States according to a formula based on population and relative per capita incomes. SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $2,212,506,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 2,196,435,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,212,506,000 The Committee recommends $2,212,506,000 for substance abuse treatment programs, including PRNS and the substance abuse pre-vention and treatment block grant to the States. The recommenda-tion includes $81,200,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act. 119 Programs of Regional and National Significance The Committee recommends $354,427,000 for PRNS within the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT]. The recommenda-tion includes $2,000,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act. PRNS include activities to increase capacity by implementing service improvements using proven evidence-based approaches as well as science-to-services activities that promote the identification of practices thought to have potential for broad service improve-ment. Within the total provided for PRNS, the Committee recommenda- tion includes funding for the following activities: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation CAPACITY: Opioid Treatment Programs/Regulatory Activities ................ 8,724 8,708 Intervention, Referral, & Treatment 46,804 30,000 Target Capacity Expansion ................................................... 67,192 36,234 67,192 Medicated Assisted Treatment to Overdose Treatment ............................ 1,000 ............................ 1,000 Building Communities of Recovery ....................................... 3,000 1,000 3,000 SCIENCE AND SERVICE: Addiction Technology Transfer Centers ................................ Communities of Recovery.\u2014 The Committee appreciates SAMHSA's implementation of new funding for communities of re-covery in fiscal year 2017 and continues to encourage SAMHSA to promote the expansion of recovery support services as well as re-duce stigma associated with addictions. Combating Opioid Abuse .\u2014Of the amount provided for Targeted Capacity Expansion, the Committee includes $55,800,000 for dis-cretionary grants to States for the purpose of expanding treatment services to those with heroin or opioid dependence. The Committee continues to direct CSAT to ensure that these grants include as an allowable use the support of medication assisted treatment and other clinically appropriate services. These grants should target States with the highest age adjusted rates of admissions and that have demonstrated a dramatic age adjusted increase in admissions for the treatment of opioid use disorders. Drug Courts .\u2014SAMHSA is directed to ensure that all drug treat- ment court funding is allocated to serve people diagnosed with a substance use disorder as their primary condition. SAMHSA is fur-ther directed to ensure that all drug treatment court grant recipi-ents work directly with the corresponding State substance abuse agency in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the 120 grant. SAMHSA should expand training and technical assistance to drug treatment court grant recipients to ensure evidence-based practices are fully implemented. Handheld Analyzers .\u2014The Committee understands the role played by handheld drug analyzers, particularly for police officers and other first responders. These instruments can identify various drugs and assist first responders in treatment referral. They also keep officers safe by minimizing the exposure to toxic drugs, while reducing the overall cost and backlog of cases at crime labs. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to support the use of block grant funds and funds authorized under section 1003 of the 21st Century Cures Act for handheld analyzers. SAMHSA shall provide an up-date on these efforts in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Oral Fluid Guidelines .\u2014The Committee is pleased with SAMHSA's recommendation of oral fluid as an alternative speci-men for drug testing and commends SAMHSA for the progress made on issuing oral fluid guidelines for the Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to publish the guidelines expeditiously and to implement the guide-lines in partnership with stakeholders and other agencies. Peer Counseling.\u2014 The Committee is aware of the benefits of peer-to-peer programs to assist in addiction treatment and coun-seling, and encourages SAMHSA's continued support for this ap-proach. However, the Committee also believes that it is important for people suffering from addiction and substance abuse to have ac-cess to peer counseling and connection to community resources in hospital settings. Accordingly, the Committee encourages SAMHSA to support counseling and addiction recovery programs focused on clinical medical providers to engage peer-to-peer counseling support and services in inpatient hospital and emergency department set-tings. Pregnant & Postpartum Women.\u2014 The Committee continues to support the continuation of the pilot program for State substance abuse agencies to address identified gaps in the continuum of care furnished to pregnant and postpartum women. The Committee en-courages the Department to prioritize States that support best- practice collaborative models for the treatment and support of preg-nant women with opioid use disorders. School-based Opioid Prevention.\u2014 When awarding opioid re- search and response grants, the Committee encourages SAMHSA, in coordination with CDC, to include school-based intervention pro-grams that provide parents and teachers with the knowledge to monitor students and provide an opportunity for early intervention. Further, SAMHSA is encouraged to include screening and referral to treatment for primary, middle and high school students and young adults at universities and to put in place support systems to help prevent influence from drug-using peers. State Targeted Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis Grants.\u2014 The Committee continues to provide $500,000,000 for State Targeted Response Grants [STR], for a total of $1,000,000,000 in the past two fiscal years. The Committee encourages HHS to ensure that these grants are focused on activities that can continue to provide opioid related treatment and abuse prevention services after Fed-eral funding has ended. It is critical that the Federal and state re-121 sponse to this epidemic continues to prioritize local efforts to sup- port communities facing unmet opioid treatment, prevention, and recovery needs. The Committee strongly encourages HHS and SAMHSA to refrain from any action that would require States and Territories to resubmit a grant proposal for the second year of State grant funding. By doing so, States could reduce administra-tive burdens and the Department could focus on promoting and im-plementing already approved plans. The Committee directs the agency to ensure States provide funds directly to local communities and counties to address the opioid crisis in areas of unmet need, and to report the Committee on such plans 1 year after enactment. SAMHSA is also directed to provide State agencies with technical assistance concerning how to enhance outreach and direct support to rural and underserved communities and providers in addressing this crisis. Further, the Committee is concerned that SAMHSA has restricted State flexibility for addressing the opioid crisis by lim-iting the amount of funding that can be used for opioid prevention activities. Treatment Facility Expansion.\u2014 The Committee is deeply con- cerned about the devastating impact that the opioid epidemic is having on families and communities throughout the country and recognizes the need to increase access to treatment facilities. The Committee requests that SAMHSA explore ways that grantees could access Federal funding for the capital costs of new treatment facilities, including planning, construction, repair, preventive main-tenance, environmental support, improvement, extension, alter-ation, purchase of fixed equipment or facilities, as well as the ac-quisition of land. SAMHSA shall provide an update on these ef-forts, including any recommendations, in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Viral Hepatitis Screening.\u2014 The Committee applauds SAMHSA for encouraging grantees to screen for viral hepatitis, including the use of innovative strategies like rapid testing and urges SAMHSA to continue these efforts. The Committee notes the disproportionate impact of viral hepatitis among minority populations and the co-in-fection rate among individuals with HIV/AIDS. The Committee urges SAMHSA to work with minority AIDS grantees to incor-porate hepatitis screening into programmatic activities. Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant The Committee recommends $1,858,079,000 for the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant [SABG]. The rec-ommendation includes $79,200,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act. According to SAMHSA, at discharge from SABG funded programs, 70 percent of individuals dem-onstrate abstinence from illegal drugs and 83 percent demonstrate abstinence from alcohol use. The block grant provides funds to States to support alcohol and drug abuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services. Funds are allocated to States according to a formula. SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $223,219,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 149,703,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 238,219,000 122 The Committee recommends $238,219,000 for the Center for Sub- stance Abuse Prevention [CSAP], the sole Federal organization with responsibility for improving accessibility and quality of sub-stance abuse prevention services. The Committee directs that all of the money appropriated explic- itly for Substance Abuse Prevention purposes both in CSAP's PRNS lines as well as the funding from the 20 percent prevention set-aside in the SABG be used only for bona fide substance abuse prevention activities and not for any other purpose to ensure the work in school-based settings is as robust as possible. Programs of Regional and National Significance The Committee provides $238,219,000 for PRNS within CSAP. Through these programs, CSAP supports: development of new prac-tice knowledge on substance abuse prevention; identification of proven effective models; dissemination of science-based interven-tion information; State and community capacity building for imple-mentation of proven, effective substance abuse prevention pro-grams; and programs addressing new needs in the prevention sys-tem. Within the total provided for PRNS, the Committee recommenda- tion includes funding for the following activities: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation CAPACITY: Strategic Prevention Framework/Partnership for Success .... 109,484 48,427 109,484 Strategic Prevention Framework Rx ......................................

The Committee is encouraged that these programs can help reduce dependence on opioids and en-courages SAMHSA to develop and disseminate best practices in preventing opioid abuse. Combating Opioid Abuse .\u2014The Committee provides $12,000,000 for grants to prevent opioid overdose related deaths. As part of the initiative to combat opioid abuse, this program will help States equip and train first responders and other community partners 123 with the use of devices that rapidly reverse the effects of opioids. The agreement also provides $12,000,000 for First Responder Training grants. Of this amount, $6,000,000 is set aside for rural communities with high rates of substance abuse. SAMHSA is di-rected to ensure applicants outline how proposed activities in the grant would work with treatment and recovery communities in ad-dition to first responders. Furthermore, the Committee provides $10,000,000 for the Strategic Prevention Framework Rx program to increase awareness of opioid abuse and misuse in communities. Opioid Prevention Grants .\u2014The Committee understands that ef- forts to address the opioid crisis must include community-based strategies to prevent opioid abuse. Therefore, the bill provides $15,000,000 for a new opioid prevention program. SAMHSA shall award opioid prevention grants to communities and community coalitions based on the current state of evidence-based and prom-ising practices. Of the amounts provided, the Committee directs that no more than $1,000,000 be used to conduct an evaluation of these grants to determine effectiveness. Further, the Committee di-rects SAMHSA to continue providing technical assistance to com-munities and coalitions by developing and distributing a list of best practices to prevent opioid abuse. SAMHSA is directed to work with NIDA, other Federal agencies, appropriate stakeholder groups, and States, in implementing these grants and developing best practices. Furthermore, SAMHSA should update this list based on new research findings, including the evaluation of the opioid prevention program grants. HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND PROGRAM SUPPORT Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $148,258,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 132,348,000 Committee 145,830,000 The Committee recommends $145,830,000 for Health Surveil- lance and Program Support activities. The recommendation in-cludes $31,428,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act. This activity supports Federal staff and the administrative func- tions of the agency. It also provides funding to SAMHSA's surveil-lance and data collection activities, including national surveys such as the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Within the total provided for Health Surveillance and Program Support, the Committee recommendation includes funding for the following activities: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Health Surveillance ........................................................................ 47,258 33,842 47,258 Program Management .................................................................... 77,000 73,043 76,000 Performance & Quality Information Systems ................................ 10,000 12,893 10,000 Public Awareness and Support ...................................................... 13,000 11,572 11,572 Behavioral Health Workforce Data ................................................. 1,000 1,000 1,000 124 Methamphetamine Abuse.\u2014 The Committee requests that SAMHSA, in partnership with the National Center for Health Sta-tistics at CDC, investigate the establishment of a comprehensive survey of the rates of methamphetamine abuse and its related indi-cators. Such a survey would include rates of methamphetamine use, treatment admissions due to methamphetamine use, rates of overdose and morality, incidence of births of methamphetamine-ad-dicted infants, interactions with law enforcement and child protec-tive services related to methamphetamine use, and any other indi-cators recommended by SAMHSA and CDC. The Committee re-quests an update on the feasibility of such a survey in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. The Committee does not include bill language requested by the administration that would provide additional transfer authority to the Administrator beyond that which is already provided to the Secretary. A GENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $324,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... ........................... Committee recommendation ................................................................. 324,000,000 The Committee provides $324,000,000 for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], which is combined with the $106,500,000 in mandatory funding from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund. AHRQ was established to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health services, as well as access to such services. AHRQ conducts, supports, and disseminates scientific and policy-relevant research on topics such as promoting high-quality care, eliminating healthcare disparities, using information technology, and evaluating the effectiveness of clinical services. HEALTH COSTS , QUALITY , AND OUTCOMES The Committee provides $187,156,000 for research on health costs, quality, and outcomes [HCQO]. The HCQO research activity is focused upon improving clinical practice, improving the healthcare system's capacity to deliver quality care, and tracking progress toward health goals through monitoring and evaluation. Within the total provided for HCQO, the Committee rec- ommendation includes funding for the following activities: [In thousands of dollars] Budget activity Fiscal year 2017 appropriation Fiscal year 2018 request Committee recommendation Research on Health Costs, Quality, and Outcomes: Prevention/Care Management ............................................... 11,649 ............................ 11,649 Health Safety Research ....................................................... 70,276 ............................ Research, Data and 88,731 ............................ 88,731 Diagnostic Quality & Safety. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the lack of dedicated research into improving how we diagnose medical conditions, especially given the magnitude of the public 125 health burden of diagnostic failures that lead to patient harm. Ac- cording to the 2015 report, ''Improving Diagnosis in Healthcare'', from the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [NASEM], diagnostic errors have been a ''blind spot'' for health care delivery and improving diagnosis is a pressing ''moral, profes-sional, and public health imperative.'' The Committee requests that AHRQ convene a cross-agency working group that will propose a strategy to enhance scientific research to improve diagnosis in healthcare, as outlined in the 2015 NASEM report. This should in-clude a review of current research, as well as consideration of op-portunities for public-private partnerships and the development of centers of excellence to propel research forward to improve diag-nostic quality and safety while reducing healthcare costs. The Com-mittee requests this information be provided in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Evidence-Based Practice .\u2014The Committee encourages AHRQ to include in its research portfolio a focus on disabilities and chronic conditions, including disability as a health disparity. The Com-mittee encourages AHRQ to use all three levels of evidence strati-fication and assessment recognized by the U.S. Preventative Serv-ices Task Force and recognize that the absence of randomized con-trolled trials does not equate to the absence of evidence. Similarly, the Committee encourages AHRQ to recognize that the inability to draw conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of a treat-ment does not mean the treatment is ineffective. Health IT Safety .\u2014The Committee recommendation includes $16,500,000 for AHRQ's work on safe health IT practices specifi-cally related to the design, implementation, usability, and safe use of health IT systems. The Committee believes this investment will generate new evidence regarding safe health IT practices that will ultimately be used by ONC, FDA, CMS, and others to inform policy interventions. Health Services Research .\u2014Health services research provides de- cisionmakers critical information to improve health care quality, increase efficiency, and inform personal health care choices. The Committee does not support the administration's proposal to con-solidate AHRQ into the NIH and instead continues to fund the agency as an independent operating division within the Depart-ment. However, the Committee is concerned that AHRQ and the other Federal agencies conducting health services research do not sufficiently coordinate their efforts to optimize Federal investments in this science. The recommendation includes $1,000,000 for AHRQ to contract with an independent entity to study health services re-search supported by Federal agencies since fiscal year 2012. This study should identify research gaps and areas for consolidation, as well as propose strategies for better coordination of the Federal health services research enterprise. The Committee requests a re-port on the findings of this study to the Committee not later than 180 days after the enactment of this act. Healthcare-Associated Infections .\u2014Within the Patient Safety portfolio, the Committee provides $36,000,000, the same level as in fiscal year 2017, for healthcare-associated infection activities. With-in this funding level, the Committee includes $10,000,000 for ac-tivities as part of the CARB initiative. These funds will support the 126 development and expansion of antibiotic stewardship programs spe- cifically focused on ambulatory and long-term care settings. Healthcare Delivery Systems.\u2014 Within the Patient Safety port- folio, the Committee includes $10,000,000 for Healthcare Delivery Systems grants, or ''patient safety learning labs.'' The purpose of these grants is to test new ways of addressing entrenched patient safety issues by using a systems engineering approach. Investigator-Initiated Research .\u2014The Committee reiterates its strong support for investigator-initiated research and believes this research should not target any specific area of health services re-search but should reflect the best unsolicited ideas from the re-search community. The Committee is aware that enhanced utiliza-tion of independent academic medical centers could lead to innova-tive and pragmatic solutions that improve clinical practices. U.S. Preventative Services Task Force [USPSTF] .\u2014The Com- mittee notes the USPSTF's inclusion of additional stakeholders and physician experts during its recent process for drafting the updated prostate cancer screening recommendation. However, the Com-mittee remains concerned about the lack of transparency in the process and directs the USPSTF to include a description of com-ments received on the draft recommendation statement and rel-evant recommendations of other Federal agencies and organiza-tions in any final recommendation. MEDICAL EXPENDITURES PANEL SURVEYS The Committee provides $66,000,000 for Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys [MEPS], which collect detailed information annually from households, healthcare providers, and employers regarding how Americans use and pay for healthcare. The data from MEPS are used to develop estimates of healthcare utilization, expendi-tures, sources of payment, and the degree of health insurance cov-erage of the U.S. population. PROGRAM SUPPORT The Committee recommends $70,844,000 for program support. This activity funds the overall management of AHRQ, including salaries, benefits, and overhead costs such as rent. C ENTERS FOR MEDICARE ANDMEDICAID SERVICES GRANTS TO STATES FOR MEDICAID Appropriations, 2017 ......................................................................... $262,003,967,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ...................................................................... 284,798,384,000 Committee recommendation ............................................................. 284,798,384,000 The Committee recommends $284,798,384,000 in mandatory funding for Grants to States for Medicaid. The fiscal year 2018 recommendation excludes $125,219,452,000 in fiscal year 2017 advance appropriations for fiscal year 2018. As requested by the administration, $134,847,759,000 is provided for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The Medicaid program provides medical care for eligible low-in- come individuals and families. It is administered by each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the territories. Federal funds for medical assistance are made available to the 127 States according to a formula that determines the appropriate Fed- eral matching rate for State program costs. This matching rate is based on the State's average per capita income relative to the na-tional average and cannot be less than 50 percent. PAYMENTS TO HEALTHCARE TRUST FUNDS Appropriations, 2017 ......................................................................... $299,187,700,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ...................................................................... 323,497,300,000 Committee recommendation ............................................................. 323,497,300,000 The Committee recommends $323,497,300,000 in mandatory funding for payments to healthcare trust funds. This entitlement account includes the general fund subsidy to the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for Medicare Part B benefits and for Medicare Part D drug benefits and administration, plus other reimbursements to the Federal Hos-pital Insurance Trust Fund for Part A benefits and related admin-istrative costs that have not been financed by payroll taxes or pre-mium contributions. The Committee provides $245,396,000,000 for the Federal pay- ment to the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. This payment provides matching funds for premiums paid by Medicare Part B enrollees. The Committee further provides $76,133,000,000 for the general fund share of benefits paid under Public Law 108-173, the Medi-care Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. As in previous years, the Committee includes bill language requested by the administration providing indefinite authority for paying the general revenue portion of the Part B premium match and provides resources for the Part D drug benefit program in the event that the annual appropriation is insufficient. The Committee recommendation also includes $422,000,000 to be transferred to the Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund as the general fund share of Part D administrative expenses. The Com-mittee recommendation includes $307,000,000 in reimbursements to the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control [HCFAC] fund, which reflects the portion of the HCFAC spending to be reimbursed by the General Fund. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $3,669,744,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 3,587,996,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,669,744,000 The Committee recommends $3,669,744,000 for CMS program management, which includes funding for research, program oper-ations, survey and certification programs, and Federal administra-tion. Research, Demonstrations and Evaluations. \u2014The Committee rec- ommends $20,054,000 for research, demonstrations, and evaluation activities. Program Operations The Committee recommends $2,519,823,000 for the Program Op- erations account, which covers a broad range of activities including claims processing and program safeguard activities performed by 128 Medicare contractors. These contractors also provide information, guidance, and technical support to both providers and beneficiaries. ACA Notifications .\u2014The Committee continues bill language re- quiring the administration to provide detailed enrollment figures to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate not less than two full business days before any pub-lic release of the information. Access to Mental Health Care .\u2014The Committee strongly urges CMS to pursue initiatives that expand access to quality care and increase parity for mental health services. Adverse Drug Events.\u2014 To improve patient safety and the effi- ciency of the Medicare Program, the Committee encourages CMS to prioritize the adoption of approved quality measures related to drugs that are associated most frequently with adverse drug events that may result in significant patient harm in the over 65 popu-lation. This should be consistent with the Department's National Action Plan for Adverse Drug Event Prevention. Caregiver Counseling and Supportive Services .\u2014The Committee is aware of a body of evidence that suggests defined counseling and supportive services delivered to family (non-paid) caregivers of Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease and dementia can substantially delay beneficiary placement in an institutional care setting and reduce Federal expenditures associated with such care. The Committee is concerned about the current and anticipated Medicare and Medicaid costs associated with Alzheimer's disease and recommends that CMS, in consultation with ACL, consider a pilot or demonstration program to evaluate the impact of such evi-dence-based Alzheimer's caregiver support models could have on the Medicare and Medicaid programs. CT Colonography .\u2014Due to the proven life and cost-savings of preventative screening for colorectal cancer, the Committee encour-ages CMS to consider covering CT Colonography as a Medicare-cov-ered colorectal cancer screening test under section 1861(pp)(1) of the Social Security Act. Diabetes Prevention and Telehealth.\u2014 The Committee commends CMS's 2017 announcement that the Center for Medicare and Med-icaid Innovation will test virtual care for the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program. The Committee encourages CMS to consider additional ways in which Medicare will cover remote patient moni-toring and urges CMS to evaluate how telehealth can be an effec-tive way to prevent and manage diabetes and other chronic dis-eases, specifically for beneficiaries in rural settings and for those without access to specialized chronic disease care. Direct and Indirect Remuneration Fees.\u2014 The Committee is con- cerned about the dramatic increase of pharmacy direct and indirect remuneration [DIR] fees in Medicare Part D. The Committee re-quests a report from CMS within 180 days after enactment of this act on how to best address this issue, including consideration of op-tions to require that all DIR fees be accounted for a point of sale; as part of negotiated price; and that any incentive fees be paid sep-arately. Electrodiagnostic [EDX] Tests.\u2014 The Committee appreciates that CMS provided additional guidance regarding the recommendations in the 2014 OIG Report: ''Questionable Billing for Medicare 129 Electrodiagnostic Tests.'' The Committee notes that utilization of codes for EDX testing continues to increase and remains interested in comprehensive solutions that advance quality care and cost sav-ings by ensuring patients do not receive unnecessary EDX tests. Falls Prevention.\u2014 The Committee recognizes the importance of injury prevention in seniors and the impact that falls can have on morbidity and mortality, as well as the rising aging population in the United States. The Committee also recognizes the significant positive outcomes in terms of averted morbidity and mortality, as well as cost savings, from models such as the Community Aging in Place\u2014Advancing Better Living for Elders [CAPABLE] program. Funded through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation's Health Care Innovation Awards, the CAPABLE program utilized occupational therapists, nurses, and home repair handymen to focus on beneficiary-directed home functional improvements, with the aim of delaying entry to skilled nursing facilities. The Com-mittee encourages CMS to look for opportunities to test models re-lated to injury and fall prevention. Fraudulent Billing.\u2014 During fiscal year 2018, the Committee en- courages CMS to investigate diagnostic laboratories' use of a fraud-ulent billing practice commonly known as fee forgiveness schemes and evaluate what role the agency can have in minimizing this practice. These illegal practices can often result in increased Medi-care and Medicaid expenditures and can cause undue burden on our Nation's healthcare system. Graduate Medical Education.\u2014 The Committee recommends that the Comptroller General of the United States conduct a study on the potential of making graduate medical education payments under the Medicare program for mid-level health providers (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) to allow physicians and other health care providers to perform to their full scope of practice; and to identify the current, actual costs involved in train-ing residents in different residency specialty types. The Comp-troller General shall provide the report within one year of the en-actment of this act and shall consult with the Committees on Ap-propriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate as well as the Senate Finance Committee and House Committee on Ways and Means and keep the Committees apprised of progress quarterly. Health Insurance Exchange Transparency .\u2014The Committee con- tinues bill language that requires CMS to provide cost information for the following categories: Federal Payroll and Other Administra-tive Costs; Exchange related Information Technology [IT]; Non-IT Program Costs, including Health Plan Benefit and Rate Review, Exchange Oversight, Payment and Financial Management, Eligi-bility and Enrollment; Consumer Information and Outreach, in-cluding the Call Center, Navigator Grants and Consumer Edu-cation and Outreach; Exchange Quality Review; Small Business Health Options Program [SHOP] and Employer Activities; and Other Exchange Activities. Cost Information should be provided for each fiscal year since the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148). CMS is also required to include the estimated costs for fiscal year 2019. 130 Immunization Information System Interoperability.\u2014 The Com- mittee is aware that HHS has made HITECH funding available to support connectivity and interoperability between Medicaid pro-viders and Immunization Information Systems [IIS]. The Com-mittee encourages the Secretary to work with the Office of Manage-ment and Budget to evaluate how waiving match requirements, as applicable, may encourage many State and local health depart-ments to take advantage of this funding opportunity. The Com-mittee requests data from CMS on State and local health depart-ments' expenditures on IIS interoperability within 18 months after enactment of this act. Intrathecal Pain Pumps. \u2014The Committee continues to be con- cerned that changes to Medicare billing practice may restrict pa-tient access to intrathecal pain pumps as an option for pain man-agement in States where the boards of pharmacy prohibit sale of compounded solutions from a pharmacist to a physician. The Com-mittee looks forward to receiving the study requested in fiscal year 2017 of the effect of this billing practice change on patient access in these States. Medicare Advantage.\u2014 The Committee continues to be concerned that the formula to determine Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates is calculated based on the per capita cost of coverage to bene-ficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part A and/or Part B. The Committee is concerned that CMS has not made progress on these payment adjustments, and encourages CMS to consider more accurate ad-justments for fiscal year 2018. Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fees.\u2014 Before finalizing implemen- tation of the final regulation (CMS-1621-F) implementing the Pro-tecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, the Committee encourages CMS to continue to work with stakeholders to address data accu-racy concerns and ensure that the reported data appropriately rep-resents the full spectrum of laboratories, including hospital, inde-pendent, and physician-office laboratories, that are paid under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. Medicare Prescription Drug Plan [PDP] Standardized Report- ing.\u2014 The Committee requests CMS to provide an update in the 2019 CJ on how they plan to require standardized reporting by PDP sponsors of all price concession received from, and incentive payments made to, network pharmacies except those contingent price concessions or incentive payments that cannot reasonably be determined at the point of sale. Plan Finder.\u2014 The Committee encourages CMS to enhance the Medicare Plan Finder web site to strengthen beneficiary's ability to shop for and choose plans that best meet their needs. CMS should consider improvements such as improving navigation on mobile de-vices, providing information on the estimated out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries for common services, and providing search-able up-to-date provider network directories. The Committee en-courages CMS to solicit input from relevant stakeholders to help inform and facilitate such changes. The Committee requests that an update of these efforts be provided in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Recovery Audit Contractors [RAC].\u2014 The Committee directs the Medicare appeals intra-agency working group to provide quarterly updates to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Rep-131 resentatives and the Senate reflecting the total number of appeals filed, appeals pending, and appeals disposed of for all four levels of the appeals process. The quarterly updates should include a breakout of RAC and non-RAC claims, an update on RAC con-tracting and how new RAC requirements have affected the rate of appeals. Risk Corridor Program .\u2014The agreement continues bill language to prevent the CMS Program Management appropriation account from being used to support risk corridor payments. The agreement directs CMS to provide a report starting with plan year 2014 and continuing through the duration of the program to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate detailing the receipts and transfer of payments for the Risk Cor-ridor Program. Rural Health .\u2014While nearly a quarter of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, access to CAHs continues to be a challenge for many residents as these hospitals face significant financial chal-lenges. The majority of rural residents are older, poorer, and less likely to have employer sponsored health plans. As a result, if a rural hospital closes, many patients end up driving long distances to see a doctor, forgo seeking medical care, or even worse, wait until it is too late to seek proper medical attention. These patients spend more money out of pocket to travel and miss routine pre-ventative care which will end up increasing healthcare costs in the long run. The Committee appreciates the ongoing work of CMS and HRSA to analyze the impact of proposed regulations on rural hos-pitals and other providers and is pleased with the recent establish-ment of the Rural Health Council to address the unique needs of rural communities. The Committee continues to direct CMS to work with HRSA's Office of Rural Health and provide an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on actions taken to alleviate the dis-proportionate impact of regulations, reimbursement cuts, and workforce issues on rural hospitals. Telehealth.\u2014 The Committee directs the Administrator, in con- sultation with the relevant agencies and stakeholders, to submit a report within 1 year after enactment of this act to the Committees of Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate evaluating the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring under all programs and pilots under the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act and the Medicaid program under title XIX of such Act with a waiver of telehealth restrictions otherwise applicable under such titles of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395m(m)). The report shall include an assessment of: (A) the number of providers and payers using telehealth and remote patient monitoring under such programs and pilots; (B) the cost impact among the beneficiaries receiving telehealth and remote pa-tient monitoring under such programs and pilots, including with respect to preventable hospitalizations, hospital readmissions, and emergency room visits, and the total cost of items and services under the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (C) beneficiary and family caregiver satisfaction with the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring under such programs and pilots; and (D) a com-parison of the utilization of, and expenditures for, the same serv-132 ices furnished under the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the usual clinical setting. Therapeutic Foster Care.\u2014 The Committee remains concerned about the lack of a uniform definition within the Medicaid program for therapeutic foster care [TFC] services. A uniform definition would improve the ability for more consistent care and treatment. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on the study requested in House Report 114-699 under this heading. Use of Opioid Drugs to Manage Chronic Pain .\u2014The Committee understands that opioid pain medications are used and are often essential in the appropriate management of acute and chronic pain. Given the national problem of misuse and abuse of prescription opioid pain medications, the Committee encourages CMS to in-crease awareness of alternative pain management strategies to opioids to reduce opioid monotherapy in appropriate cases. Use of Social Security Numbers on Medicare Beneficiaries' Cards .\u2014The Committee is encouraged by CMS plans to start send- ing new Medicare cards with a Medicare Beneficiary Identifier to Medicare beneficiaries by October 2018. The Committee directs CMS to provide an update on the progress of this initiative in their fiscal year 2019 CJ. Vaccine Utilization.\u2014 The Committee is concerned about the un- derutilization of vaccinations, particularly pneumococcal vaccines and encourages CMS to continue to require that electronic health records communicate with immunization registries, so that clini-cians accessing the registries have the most complete immunization history available and to continue efforts to remind beneficiaries and their providers to adhere to the recommendations. State Survey and Certification The Committee recommends $397,334,000 for State Survey and Certification activities, which ensure that institutions and agencies providing care to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries meet Fed-eral health, safety, and program standards. On-site surveys are conducted by State survey agencies, with a pool of Federal sur-veyors performing random monitoring surveys. The Committee continues to support CMS collecting and ana- lyzing the findings from this surveillance tool to inform the agen-cy's education and surveillance efforts moving forward. Federal Administration The Committee recommends $732,533,000 for Federal Adminis- tration, which funds the majority of CMS' staff and operating ex-penses for routine activities such as planning, implementing, evalu-ating, and ensuring accountability in the programs administered by CMS. HEALTH CARE FRAUD AND ABUSE CONTROL Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $725,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 751,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 745,000,000 The Committee recommends $745,000,000, to be transferred from the Medicare trust funds, for Health Care Fraud and Abuse Con-trol [HCFAC] activities. The latest data demonstrate for every 133 $1.00 spent on fraud and abuse, $2.00 is recovered by the Treas- ury. The Committee recommendation includes a base amount of $311,000,000 and an additional $434,000,000 through a budget cap adjustment authorized by section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. A DMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AND FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAMS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $3,010,631,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 2,995,400,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,995,400,000 The Committee recommendation includes $2,995,400,000 in fiscal year 2018 mandatory funds for Child Support Enforcement and Family Support programs. In addition, the Committee recommends $1,400,000,000 in advance funding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. These funds support States' efforts to promote the self-sufficiency and economic security of low-income families, including administra-tive expenses matching funds and incentive payments to States for child support enforcement; grants to States to help establish and administer access and visitation programs between noncustodial parents and their children; payments to territories for benefits to certain aged, blind, or disabled individuals; and temporary benefits for certain repatriated citizens. LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $3,390,304,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... ........................... Committee 3,390,304,000 The Committee recommendation includes $3,390,304,000 for LIHEAP, which provides home heating and cooling assistance to low-income households, generally in the form of payments to en-ergy vendors on behalf of the recipient. Within the total, the Com-mittee recommendation includes up to $2,988,000 for program in-tegrity and oversight efforts, the same as the fiscal year 2017 level. REFUGEE AND ENTRANT ASSISTANCE Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. estimate, 2018 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,506,691,000 The Committee recommends $1,506,691,000 for Refugee and En- trant Assistance [REA] programs. These programs provide a vari- ety of benefits and services to refugees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, immigrants arriving on Special Immigrant Visas, traf-ficking victims, and torture victims (collectively referred to below as ''refugees''). These programs also provide temporary care and services for unaccompanied children apprehended by the Depart-ment of Homeland Security or other law enforcement agencies, who have no lawful immigration status in the United States until they can be placed with a parent, guardian, or other sponsor while awaiting adjudication of their immigration status. 134 The U.S. refugee protection and admission programs reflect U.S. humanitarian and strategic interests. The U.S. refugee resettle-ment program provides for the safe resettlement of some of the most vulnerable refugees and not only saves lives, but also strengthens our national security by providing support and shared responsibility for strategic allies and regions. The Committee affirms the community consultation process em- bedded in the U.S. refugee resettlement program, which is ground-ed in its public-private partnerships and thrives on cooperation among local, State, and Federal stakeholders. In times of sudden reductions in refugee arrivals, the Committee encourages HHS, to the extent practicable, to ensure that resettlement agencies are able to maintain their infrastructure and capacity at a level to con-tinue to serve new refugees, previously arrived refugees, and others who remain statutorily eligible for integration services, and to en-sure future arrivals are adequately served. Transitional and Medical Services The Committee recommendation includes $320,000,000 for Tran- sitional and Medical Services [TAMS]. This program provides grants to States and nonprofit organizations to provide up to 8 months of cash and medical assistance to arriving refugees, as well as foster care services to unaccompanied minors. In fiscal year 2018, HHS estimates the number of eligible arriv- als will significantly decrease relative to fiscal years 2016 and 2017. This is due to a significant estimated reduction in eligible Cuban entrants because of the change in administration policy in January 2017 that ended the so called ''wet-foot/dry-foot'' policy, and an assumed reduction in the refugee admissions ceiling to 50,000, which will be set by the State Department later this year. Accordingly, the Committee recommendation includes a decrease in funding for TAMS, consistent with current HHS estimates and ex-pects the funding level provided will allow HHS to at least sustain the current level and scope of services provided to eligible arrivals, including maintaining the number of months refugees are eligible for benefits. Further, the Committee notes that there is consider-able uncertainty in the estimates of the costs for this program, and expects HHS to closely monitor this account and promptly notify the Committee of any shortfalls so they can be addressed. The Committee will consider revised funding needs as necessary. To that end, the Committee directs HHS to provide monthly updates of eligible arrivals by category to the Committees on Appropria-tions of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Finally, the Committee directs HHS, in future budget justifications, to include actual and estimated costs broken out by major category, including for the unaccompanied refugee minor program, matching grant pro-gram, cash assistance, medical care, and other categories as appro-priate. The Committee continues to support the matching grant program and strongly encourages HHS to increase the percentage of eligible arrivals served by the program. Further, the Committee strongly encourages HHS to give matching grant organizations flexibility in administering their programs, including, when justified, carrying 135 over unexpended funding and slots and providing exemptions to the 31 day enrollment period. Refugee Support Services The Committee recommendation includes $207,201,000 for Ref- ugee Support Services. The budget request proposes to consolidate funding for Social Services, Preventive Health, and Targeted As-sistance into this new program. The Committee supports this con-solidation which should simplify administration of refugee services at the Federal, State, and local level. This funding would be allo-cated in a similar manner as currently funded programs, by a com-bination of formula and competitive grants, based on recent refugee and arrival data, including accounting for secondary migration, and to address other critical needs. The Committee continues to support the services currently pro- vided by the Social Services program, as well as the Targeted As-sistance Grant program, which addresses the critical needs of coun-ties with high arrival patterns and high concentrations of refugees facing difficulties achieving self-sufficiency. Within the total for Refugee Support Services, the Committee recommendation includes $4,600,000 for Refugee Health Promotion competitive grants, the same as the fiscal year 2017 funding level. Victims of Trafficking The Committee recommendation includes $20,755,000 for Victims of Trafficking programs. These programs support a national net-work of organizations that provide a variety of services\u2014including case management, counseling, benefit coordination, and housing as-sistance\u2014for victims of commercial sex and forced labor trafficking. Within the total, the Committee recommendation includes $15,000,000 for services for foreign national victims, and $5,755,000 to improve services available for U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. The Committee directs HHS to use the in-crease in funding provided for the Victims of Trafficking program to help address unmet needs in foreign national victim assistance programs. The Committee recommendation also includes no less than the fiscal year 2017 level for the national human trafficking resource center. Social Services The Committee recommendation consolidates funding for this program into a new Refugee Support Services program, as re-quested by the administration. Preventive Health The Committee recommendation consolidates funding for this program into a new Refugee Support Services program. Targeted Assistance The Committee recommendation consolidates funding for this program into a new Refugee Support Services program, as re-quested by the administration. 136 Unaccompanied Children The Committee recommendation includes $948,000,000 for the Unaccompanied Children [UC] program. The UC program provides temporary shelter and basic services to children who have no law-ful immigration status in the United States and who have been ap-prehended in the United States by the Department of Homeland Security or other law enforcement agencies without a parent or guardian. HHS takes custody of the children until they can be placed with a parent or guardian living in the United States pend-ing resolution of their immigration status, or until their immigra-tion status otherwise changes. There is significant uncertainty in the cost estimates for this pro- gram, which depend heavily on the number of unaccompanied chil-dren coming to the United States and referred to HHS. This year, the number of children coming to the United States and referred to HHS has significantly decreased. As a result, based on current estimates and funding levels, HHS estimates it will carry over un-obligated balances from fiscal year 2017 that were not expected to be available when formulating the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Further, if the number of arrivals continue at roughly this level, HHS may need less funding in fiscal year 2018 than in fiscal year 2017, or as requested for fiscal year 2018. The Committee will con-tinue to work closely with HHS on estimated needs in this program as more data becomes available throughout the year to ensure HHS has sufficient resources to properly care for children in their custody and to continue to provide all post-release services at least at the level as provided in fiscal year 2017. In addition to the fiscal year 2018 funding provided here, the Committee recommendation includes a rescission of $140,000,000 in prior-year unobligated balances. Victims of Torture The Committee recommendation includes $10,735,000 for the Victims of Torture program. This program provides treatment, so-cial, and legal services to victims of torture and training to healthcare providers on treating the physical and psychological ef-fects of torture. PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $2,856,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 2,761,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,856,000,000 The Committee recommends $2,856,000,000 for the Child Care and Development Block Grant [CCDBG], a formula grant to States that provides financial assistance to families to help pay for child care, and otherwise improve the quality of child care programs. The CCDBG Act allows HHS to offer guidance to States on child- to-provider ratios. Accordingly, the Committee directs the Depart-ment to report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate no later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act on the effect of child-to-provider ratio requirements on the average cost of child care, the quality and 137 safety of child care programs, and the steps HHS has taken to pro- vide guidance to States on child-to-provider ratios. SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,700,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... ........................... Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,700,000,000 The Committee recommends $1,700,000,000 in mandatory funds for SSBG, a flexible source of funding that allows States to provide a diverse array of services to low-income children and families, the disabled, and the elderly. CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SERVICES PROGRAMS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $11,294,368,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 10,204,293,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 11,284,368,000 The Committee recommends $11,284,368,000 for Children and Families Services programs. These funds support a variety of pro-grams for children, youth, and families; Native Americans; victims of child abuse, neglect, and domestic violence; and other vulnerable populations. Head Start The Committee recommendation includes $9,253,095,000 for Head Start. Head Start provides grants directly to local organiza-tions to provide comprehensive early childhood education services to children and their families, from before birth to age 5. The Committee continues to direct HHS to ensure that as part of the effort to expand the duration of Head Start services, grant-ees continue to have flexibility to meet the needs of their local com-munity and to fund other quality improvement activities that may be necessary to improve the quality of programs prior to expanding the duration of services. The Committee recommendation includes, in addition to funds otherwise available for Early Head Start, $640,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2017 level, for Early Head Start Expansion and Child Care Partnerships grants. The Committee continues to direct HHS to give equal priority to grantees providing more traditional Early Head Start services and those forming child care partner-ships. The Committee continues to support this partnership model but such partnerships will not be viable in every community and in many places it may be more appropriate to simply provide tradi-tional Early Head Start services. Within the total for Head Start, the Committee recommendation includes up to $25,000,000, the same as the comparable fiscal year 2017 level, for transition-related costs associated with the Head Start Designation Renewal System [DRS]. In addition, the Com-mittee continues to encourage HHS to continue to consider the unique challenges faced by Head Start grantees in remote and frontier areas when reviewing such grantees' compliance with health and dental screening requirements as part of the DRS. 138 Preschool Development Grants The Committee recommendation includes $250,000,000 for Pre- school Development Grants. This program, as authorized in the Every Student Succeeds Act, provides competitive grants to States to improve the coordination, collaboration and quality of existing early childhood programs; improve the transition from early child-hood programs to kindergarten; implement evidence-based prac-tices; improve professional development for early childhood pro-viders; and generally improve educational opportunities for chil-dren. All funding provided in fiscal year 2018 will support new grants, under the new authorization of the program. Consolidated Runaway and Homeless Youth Program The Committee recommendation includes $101,980,000 for the Consolidated Runaway and Homeless Youth program. This pro-gram supports the Basic Centers program, which provides tem-porary shelter, counseling, and after-care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families; the Transitional Living Program, which provides longer-term shelter and services for older youth; and a national toll-free runaway and homeless youth crisis hotline. Education and Prevention Grants To Reduce Sexual Abuse of Run- away Youth The Committee recommendation includes $17,141,000 for Edu- cation and Prevention Grants to Reduce Sexual Abuse of Runaway and Homeless Youth. This program provides competitive grants for street-based outreach and education services for runaway and homeless youth who are subjected to, or are at risk of being sub-jected to, sexual abuse or exploitation. Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment State Grants The Committee recommendation includes $25,310,000 for the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment State Grant program. This program provides formula grants to States to improve their child protective service systems. Child Abuse Discretionary Activities The Committee recommendation includes $33,000,000 for Child Abuse Discretionary Activities. This program supports discre-tionary grants for research, demonstration, and technical assist-ance to increase the knowledge base of evidence-based practices and to disseminate information to State and local child welfare pro-grams. Quality Improvement Center for Research-based Infant-Toddler Court Teams [QIC-CT].\u2014 The Committee supports continued fund- ing for a national resource center to preserve, disseminate, and am-plify the work of the QIC-CT by providing training and technical assistance in support of such court teams' efforts across the coun-try. These efforts should build upon and continue the work of sites established through the QIC-CT initiative, which have brought to-gether the court system, child welfare agencies, health profes-sionals, and community leaders to improve current practices in the 139 child welfare system and make better-informed decisions on behalf of the child. Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention The Committee recommendation includes $39,764,000 for the Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention program. This program provides formula grants to States that then disburse funds to local, community-based organizations to improve local child abuse pre-vention and treatment efforts, including providing direct services and improving the coordination between State and community- based organizations. Child Welfare Services The Committee recommendation includes $268,735,000 for Child Welfare Services. This formula grant program helps State and trib-al public welfare agencies improve their child welfare services with the goal of keeping families together. These funds help States and tribes provide a continuum of services that prevent child neglect, abuse or exploitation; allow children to remain with their families, when appropriate; promote the safety and permanence of children in foster care and adoptive families; and provide training and pro-fessional development to the child welfare workforce. Child Welfare Research, Training, and Demonstration The Committee recommendation includes $17,984,000 for child welfare research, training, and demonstration projects. This pro-gram provides grants to public and nonprofit organizations for demonstration projects that encourage experimental and promising types of child welfare services, as well as projects that improve education and training programs for child welfare service pro-viders. National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being .\u2014The Com- mittee recommendation includes funding within this program for HHS to continue the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being. Adoption Opportunities The Committee recommends $39,100,000 for the Adoption Oppor- tunities program. This program funds discretionary grants to help facilitate the elimination of barriers to adoption and provide tech-nical assistance to help States increase the number of children adopted, particularly children with special needs. The Committee supports ACF's efforts in fiscal year 2017 to fund activities to improve hospital-based adoption support services for pregnant and expectant mothers, including training for hospital staff and doctors. The Committee supports the continued funding of such activities, which will help ensure that mothers who wish to make an adoption have access to trained staff and comprehen-sive supports throughout the adoption process. Adoption Incentives The Committee recommends $37,943,000 for the Adoption Incen- tives program. This program provides formula-based incentive pay-ments to States to encourage them to increase the number of adop-140 tions of children from the foster care system, with an emphasis on children who are the hardest to place. Social Services and Income Maintenance Research The Committee recommends $6,512,000 for Social Services and Income Maintenance Research. These funds support research and evaluation of cost-effective programs that increase the stability and economic independence of families and contribute to the healthy development of children and youth. Native American Programs The Committee recommends $52,050,000 for Native American programs. These funds support a variety of programs to promote self-sufficiency and cultural preservation activities among Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, and Pacific Islander organizations and communities. Native American Language Preservation.\u2014 Within the total, the Committee recommendation includes $12,000,000 for Native Amer-ican language preservation activities, including no less than $4,000,000 for Native American language nests and survival schools, as authorized by sections 803C(b)(7)(A)-(B) of the Native American Programs Act. The Committee directs HHS to give pri-ority to programs with rigorous immersion programs. Native American Early Education .\u2014The Committee is concerned that some Federal programs that support early childhood develop-ment in American Indian and Alaska Native communities are not well-coordinated and, therefore, reduce the abilities of these tribal communities to develop and implement community-wide early childhood initiatives. The Committee encourages the Secretary of HHS (through the Assistant Secretary for ACF) to convene a work-ing group of Federal early childhood program administrators, tribal early childhood stakeholders, and tribal leaders to examine this issue. Community Services Block Grant The Committee recommendation includes $700,000,000 for the Community Services Block Grant [CSBG]. The CSBG is a formula grant to States and Indian tribes to provide a wide range of serv-ices to alleviate causes of poverty in communities and to assist low- income individuals in becoming self-sufficient. States are required to pass on at least 90 percent of these funds to local community- based organizations, the vast majority of which are community ac-tion agencies. Community Economic Development The Committee recommendation includes $19,883,000 for the Community Economic Development [CED] program, which provides grants to community development corporations to support employ-ment and business opportunities for low-income individuals. Com-munity development corporations leverage on average $10 in pri-vate capital to every $1 in Federal funds, and the job creation standards required by the Office of Community Services are among the most stringent in the Federal system. 141 The Committee recognizes the value in providing communities with the tools necessary to create sustainable economic develop-ment to help low-income families living in those communities. In awarding funds under this program, the Committee encourages ACF to give priority to rural communities, to help them identify community service needs and improve upon the services provided to low-income individuals and families in such communities. Rural Community Facilities The Committee recommendation includes $7,500,000 for the Rural Community Facilities program, which provides grants to re-gional non-profit organizations to provide technical assistance to small, low-income rural communities, that are not served by other similar Federal programs, to help manage, develop, and improve safe drinking and waste water facilities. National Domestic Violence Hotline The Committee recommendation includes $8,250,000 for the Na- tional Domestic Violence Hotline. This national, toll-free hotline provides critical emergency assistance and information to victims of domestic violence 24 hours a day. Family Violence Prevention and Services The Committee recommendation includes $156,000,000 for Fam- ily Violence Prevention and Services programs. These funds sup-port programs to prevent family violence and provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victims of domestic violence and their dependents. The Committee recommendation is $5,000,000 more than the fis- cal year 2017 level. The Committee directs HHS to use the increase to supplement existing funding for Native American Tribes and Tribal Organizations, and recognizes the importance of providing supports that are culturally appropriate to the populations they serve. Chafee Education and Training Vouchers The Committee recommendation includes $43,257,000 for the Chafee Education and Training Voucher program. This program supports vouchers to foster care youth to help pay for expenses re-lated to postsecondary education and vocational training. Disaster Human Services Case Management The Committee recommends $1,864,000 for Disaster Human Services Case Management. This program assists States in estab-lishing the capacity to provide case management services in a time-ly manner in the event of a disaster. It ensures that States are able to meet social service needs during disasters by helping disaster victims prepare recovery plans, referring them to service providers and FEMA contacts to identify needed assistance, and providing ongoing support and monitoring through the recovery process. Program Administration The Committee recommendation includes $205,000,000 for the Federal costs of administering ACF programs. 142 PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $384,765,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 404,651,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 384,765,000 The Committee recommends $384,765,000 for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program. The Committee recommendation in-cludes $325,000,000 in mandatory funds authorized by the Social Security Act and $59,765,000 in discretionary appropriations. This program supports activities that can prevent the emergence of family crises that might require the temporary or permanent re-moval of a child from his or her home. Grants allow States to oper-ate coordinated programs of family preservation services, time-lim- ited family reunification services, community-based family support services, and adoption promotion and support services. The Committee notes that the authorization for Promoting Safe and Stable Families expired in fiscal year 2016. Mandatory funding for certain court improvement programs funded within this account were continued in division M of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 but are not assumed to continue in the CBO baseline for fiscal year 2018. Accordingly, the Committee recommendation does not include continued funding for those activities in fiscal year 2018. PAYMENTS FOR FOSTER CARE AND PERMANENCY Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $5,764,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 6,225,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 6,225,000,000 The Committee recommends $6,225,000,000 in mandatory funds for Payments for Foster Care and Permanency. In addition, the Committee recommends $2,700,000,000 in advance mandatory funding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. These funds sup-port programs that assist States with the costs of maintaining eli-gible children in foster care, prepare children for living on their own, assist relatives with legal guardianship of eligible children, and find and support adoptive homes for children with special needs. Foster Care Data Collection.\u2014 The Committee directs ACF to sub- mit a report to Congress on multigenerational foster care data. The Committee is interested in data that may be used to better target programs to ensure foster care involvement does not continue from generation to generation. The report shall include what data is cur-rently available on whether biological parents of children placed in foster care were themselves in foster care at any time, at what age, for how long, and if they emancipated from the foster care system. The report should also recommend the best method for collecting data on multigenerational foster care. A DMINISTRATION FOR COMMUNITY LIVING AGING AND DISABILITY SERVICES PROGRAMS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,993,815,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 1,851,450,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,993,815,000 143 The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,993,815,000 for the Administration for Community Living [ACL], which in-cludes $27,700,000 to be transferred to ACL from the PPH Fund. ACL was created with the goal of increasing access to community support for older Americans and people with disabilities. It is charged with administering programs authorized under the Older Americans Act [OAA] and the Developmental Disabilities Act, as well as promoting community living policies throughout the Fed-eral Government for older Americans and people with disabilities. Home- and Community-Based Supportive Services The Committee recommends an appropriation of $350,224,000 for the Home- and Community-Based Supportive Services program. This program provides formula grants to States and territories to fund a wide range of social services that enable seniors to remain independent and in their homes for as long as possible. State agen-cies on aging award funds to designated area agencies on aging that, in turn, make awards to local service providers. This activity supports services such as transportation, adult day care, physical fitness programs, and in-home assistance such as personal care and homemaker assistance. The Committee directs ACL to work with States to prioritize innovative service models, like naturally occur-ring retirement communities [NORCs], which help older Americans remain independent as they age. The Committee notes that NORCs, and similar settings, are a more cost-effective alternative to long-term care that enables older Americans to be more engaged in their communities while living at home. Preventive Health Services The Committee recommends $19,848,000 for Preventive Health Services. This program funds activities such as medication manage-ment and enhanced fitness and wellness programs. These programs help seniors stay healthy and avoid chronic disease, thus reducing the need for costly medical interventions. The Committee main-tains bill language that requires States to use these funds to sup-port evidence-based models that enhance the wellness of seniors. Protection of Vulnerable Older Americans The Committee recommends $20,658,000 for grants to States for the Long-term Care Ombudsman program and the Prevention of Elder Abuse program. Both programs provide formula grants to States to prevent the abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older indi-viduals. The ombudsman program focuses on the needs of residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, while the elder abuse prevention program targets the elderly community at large. National Family Caregiver Support Program The Committee recommends $150,586,000 for the National Fam- ily Caregiver Support program. Funds appropriated for this activity establish a multifaceted support system in each State for family caregivers, allowing them to care for their loved ones at home for as long as possible. States may use funding to provide information to caregivers about available services, assistance to caregivers in 144 gaining access to services, caregiver counseling and training, res- pite care to enable caregivers to be temporarily relieved from their caregiving responsibilities, and limited supplemental services that fill remaining service gaps. Native American Caregiver Support Program The Committee recommendation includes $7,556,000 to carry out the Native American Caregiver Support program. This program provides grants to tribes for the support of American Indian, Alas-kan Native, and Native Hawaiian families caring for older relatives with chronic illness or disability, as well as for grandparents caring for grandchildren. Congregate and Home-Delivered Nutrition Services The Committee recommends an appropriation of $450,342,000 for congregate nutrition services and $227,342,000 for home-delivered meals. These programs address the nutritional needs of older indi-viduals, thus helping them to stay healthy and reduce their risk of disability. Funded projects must make home-delivered and con-gregate meals available at least once a day, 5 days a week, and each meal must meet a minimum of one-third of daily dietary re-quirements. While States receive separate allotments of funds for congregate meals, home-delivered meals, and supportive services, they have flexibility to transfer funds between these programs. Nutrition Services Incentives Program. \u2014The Committee rec- ommendation includes $160,069,000 for the Nutrition Services Program [NSIP]. NSIP augments funding for congregate and home-delivered meals provided to older adults. States and tribes may choose to receive all or part of their funding in the form of commodities from the USDA. Aging Grants to Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiian Organizations The Committee recommends $31,208,000 for grants to Native Americans. This program provides grants to eligible tribal organi-zations for the delivery of nutrition and supportive services to Na-tive Americans. Aging Network Support Activities The Committee recommends $9,961,000 for Aging Network Sup- port activities. These funds support activities that expand public understanding of aging and the aging process, apply social research and analysis to improve access to and delivery of services for older individuals, test innovative ideas and programs, and provide tech-nical assistance to agencies that administer programs authorized by the OAA. Within funding for the Aging Network Support Activities, the Committee supports the continuation of the National Alzheimer's Call Center, which is available in all States, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, year-round, to provide expert advice, crisis counseling, care consultation and information referral services in at least 140 lan-guages, for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their family members and informal caregivers. The Committee also includes $2,500,000 to help provide sup- portive services for aging Holocaust survivors in the United States. 145 Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration Grants to States The Committee recommendation includes $4,800,000 for Alz- heimer's Disease Demonstration Grants to States. This program funds competitive grants to States to test and implement new mod-els of care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's Disease Initiative The Committee recommends $14,700,000 in mandatory funding be transferred from the PPH Fund to ACL for the Alzheimer's Dis-ease Initiative. Of the total, $10,500,000 is provided to expand the availability of home- and community-based dementia services and supports. The remaining $4,200,000 is provided for a public aware-ness outreach campaign regarding Alzheimer's disease. Lifespan Respite Care The Committee recommends $3,360,000 for the Lifespan Respite Care program. The Lifespan Respite Care program provides grants to States to expand respite care services to family caregivers, im-prove the local coordination of respite care resources, and improve access to and quality of respite care services, thereby reducing fam-ily caregiver strain. Chronic Disease Self-Management Program The Committee recommends $8,000,000 be transferred from the PPH Fund to ACL for the Chronic Disease Self-Management Pro-gram [CDSMP]. This program assists those with chronic disease to manage their conditions and improve their health status. Topics covered by the program include nutrition; appropriate use of medi-cations; fitness; and effective communications with healthcare pro-viders. CDSMP has been shown through multiple studies to result in significant and measurable improvements in health and quality of life, as well as reductions in hospitalizations and emergency room visits. Elder Falls Prevention The Committee recommends that $5,000,000 be transferred from the PPH Fund for Elder Falls Prevention activities at ACL. Pre-venting falls will help seniors stay independent and in their homes and avoid costly hospitalizations and hip fractures, which fre-quently lead to nursing home placement. The Committee intends that these funds should be used in coordination with CDC for pub-lic education about the risk of these falls, as well as implementa-tion and dissemination of community-based strategies that have been proven to reduce the incidence of falls among seniors. Elder Rights Support Activities The Committee recommends $13,874,000 for Elder Rights Sup- port activities, including $10,000,000 for the Elder Justice Initia-tive. These activities support programs that provide information, training, and technical assistance to legal and aging services orga-nizations in order to prevent and detect elder abuse and neglect. 146 Aging and Disability Resource Centers The Committee recommendation includes $6,119,000 for Aging and Disability Resource Centers [ADRCs]. These centers provide information, one-on-one counseling, and access for individuals to learn about their long-term services and support options with the goal of allowing seniors and individuals with disabilities to main-tain their independence. The Committee urges ACL to improve co-ordination among ADRCs, area agencies on aging, and centers for independent living to ensure that there is ''no wrong door'' to access services. State Health Insurance Assistance Program The Committee recommendation includes $47,115,000 for State Health Insurance Assistance Programs [SHIPs], which provide ac-curate and understandable health insurance information to Medi-care beneficiaries and their families. Paralysis Resource Center The Committee recommendation includes $6,700,000 for the Pa- ralysis Resource Center, which has long provided essential, com-prehensive information and referral services to people living with paralysis and their families. Since 2002, the program has expanded to include a network of information specialists, a substantial qual-ity of life grant program, a Peer and Family support program, a one of a kind Paralysis Resource Guide, and a NeuroRecovery Re-habilitation Network. These resources and services focus on the promotion of independence and quality of life for the more than 6,000,000 Americans across the country living with paralysis. Limb Loss The Committee provides $2,500,000 for the Limb Loss program, which supports programs and activities to improve the health of people with limb loss and promote their well-being, quality of life, prevent disease, and provide support to their families and care-givers. Maintaining these programs is critical to support inde-pendent living within the disability community across their life course. Traumatic Brain Injury The Committee provides $9,321,000 for the Traumatic Brain In- jury program. The program supports implementation and planning grants to States for coordination and improvement of services to in-dividuals and families with traumatic brain injuries. Such services can include: pre-hospital care, emergency department care, hospital care, rehabilitation, transitional services, education, employment, long-term support, and protection and advocacy services. The Committee includes not less than the fiscal year 2017 fund- ing level for protection and advocacy services, as authorized under section 1305 of Public Law 106-310. Developmental Disabilities State Councils The Committee recommendation includes $73,000,000 for State councils on developmental disabilities. These councils work to de-velop, improve, and expand the system of services and supports for 147 people with developmental disabilities at the State and local level. Councils engage in activities such as training, educating the public, building capacity, and advocating for change in State policies with the goal of furthering the inclusion and integration of individuals with developmental disabilities in all aspects of community life. Partnerships for Innovation, Inclusion, and Independence The Committee does not consolidate the State Councils on Devel- opmental Disabilities, State Independent Living Councils, and State Advisory Boards on Traumatic Brain Injury. The Committee recognizes the unique role played by each program and believes consolidation into one program will not serve the needs of the peo-ple living with a disability. Developmental Disabilities Protection and Advocacy The Committee recommendation includes $38,734,000 for protec- tion and advocacy programs for people with developmental disabil-ities. This formula grant program provides funds to States to estab-lish and maintain protection and advocacy systems that protect the legal and human rights of persons with developmental disabilities who are receiving treatment, services, or rehabilitation. Voting Access for Individuals With Disabilities The Committee recommendation includes $4,963,000 to improve voting access for individuals with disabilities. This program pro-vides grants to protection and advocacy organizations to ensure that individuals with disabilities have the opportunity to partici-pate in every step of the electoral process, including registering to vote, accessing polling places, and casting a vote. Developmental Disabilities Projects of National Significance The Committee recommendation includes $10,000,000 for projects of national significance to assist persons with develop-mental disabilities. This program funds grants and contracts that develop new technologies and demonstrate innovative methods to support the independence, productivity, and integration into the community of persons with developmental disabilities. Technical Assistance. \u2014The Committee includes $643,000 for technical assistance and training for the State Councils on Develop-mental Disabilities. Transportation .\u2014The Committee includes $1,000,000 to fund transportation assistance activities for older adults and persons with disabilities. These activities should focus on the most cost-ef-fective and sustainable strategies that can be replicated to other communities. The Committee is pleased with the Inclusive Commu-nity Transportation program's efforts to integrate rural transit sys-tems for individuals with disabilities and older adults to access health care services, paratransit, multiple transportation providers, and other critical community based supports. These small commu-nity demonstration grants should be designed to include the per-spectives of individuals with disabilities and older adults in the transportation system and service design. 148 University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities The Committee recommendation includes $38,619,000 for the University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities [UCEDDs], a network of 67 centers that are interdisciplinary edu-cation, research and public service units of a university system or public or nonprofit entities associated with universities. The fund-ing will keep the national network of Centers strong and able to assist States to initiate collaborative research, education, training, and service efforts that help States to implement ESSA and WIOA, thereby ensuring that youth with disabilities successfully complete elementary school and transition from school to postsecondary edu-cation and/or integrated employment. The funding also allows the Centers to continue to respond to emerging and emergent national issues such as assisting in ongoing developmental monitoring, espe-cially for children exposed to lead and other environmental teratogens, and for infants exposed to the Zika virus with its re-sulting complications. This funding also allows the University Cen-ters to continue to address the needs of the rising numbers of indi-viduals on the autism spectrum; demonstrate cost effective long term services and supports for adults with disabilities and those aging with disabilities; support returning veterans; and provide technical assistance to strengthen and support the national net-work of Centers as the disseminate research and best practices na-tionwide. Independent Living The Committee recommendation includes $101,183,000 for the Independent Living Program. This program helps ensure that indi-viduals with disabilities can live a productive and independent life in society. Funding helps States sustain, improve, and expand inde-pendent living services and establish and support a network of cen-ters for independent living. National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabili- tation Research The Committee recommendation includes $103,970,000 for the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabili-tation Research [NIDILRR]. The NIDILRR supports research and activities that help to maximize the full potential of individuals with disabilities in employment, independent living, and social ac-tivities. The Committee recognizes that there is a significant opportunity over the next decade for the Department to simultaneously lower healthcare costs and improve quality of life for the older adult and disabled population by embracing the rapidly growing shift to tech-nology solutions for daily living. These solutions are poised to ex-tend the ability to live independently into advanced age, and ''age in place'', helping to bridge the ''care gap'' so that older and dis-abled adults might avoid nursing homes and other institutionalized care as long as possible, while also remaining connected to their families and communities. The Committee encourages NIDILRR to continue to support re- search and activities that help older or disabled adults to increase, maintain, or improve their functional capabilities and allow for 149 independent living. To that end, the Committee supports increased investment in public university research to harness technological advances, including wireless sensors, smart materials, and body wearables; movers and protective devices; and companion and qual-ity of life robotics, which have the potential to enable mobility, im- prove health, protect against falls and injuries, maximize commu-nity engagement, encourage productivity, and preserve independ-ence among older individuals and their families. Special emphasis should be given to research projects that seek to address medically underserved areas in rural and frontier regions with high popu-lations of older adults, disabled populations, and tribal commu-nities. Assistive Technology The Committee recommendation includes $34,000,000 for Assist- ive Technology [AT]. AT provides States with funding to support individuals with disabilities of all ages to obtain devices and serv-ices that will increase, maintain, or improve their functional capa-bilities. Program Administration The Committee recommends $40,063,000 for program adminis- tration at ACL. These funds support salaries and related expenses for program management and oversight activities. O FFICE OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $525,457,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 361,966,000 Committee 535,457,000 The Committee recommends $535,457,000 for General Depart- mental Management [GDM]. The recommendation includes $64,828,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act. This appropriation supports activities that are associated with the Secretary's role as policy officer and general manager of the Department. It supports health activities performed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health [ASH], including the Office of the Surgeon General. GDM funds also support the Department's centralized services carried out by several Office of the Secretary staff divisions, including personnel management, administrative and management services, information resources management, intergovernmental relations, legal services, planning and evalua-tion, finance and accounting, and external affairs. Alzheimer's Education Campaign.\u2014 The Committee continues to be interested in the Secretary's progress in implementing a com-prehensive outreach and education campaign and directs the Sec-retary to submit to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and Senate, the Committee on Finance, the Committee on Ways and Means, and the Committee on Energy and Commerce an annual report describing the activities carried out the preceding fiscal year, and an evaluation of the extent to which 150 such activities have been effective in improving the health and well-being of racial and ethnic minority groups. Antibiotic Resistance .\u2014The Committee supports the CARB initia- tive that strengthens efforts to prevent, detect, and control illness and deaths related to infections caused by antibiotic resistant bac-teria. The Committee directs the Department to continue to work with DOD, USDA, VA, and FDA to broaden and expand efforts to track and store both antibiotic resistant bacteria genes and the mo-bile genetic elements from antibiotic resistant bacteria along with metadata. The Committee also recognizes the importance of basic and applied research toward the development of new vaccines as a way to prevent future antibiotic resistance through infection pre-vention and control. The Committee encourages the Secretary to prioritize this research as part of its strategy to combat antibiotic resistance. The Committee also urges the Secretary to consider the use of existing vaccines in antibiotic stewardship efforts to help mitigate new resistance development. The Department shall in-clude in the fiscal year 2019 CJ a detailed update on the progress being made to implement the CARB national strategy. Breast Density.\u2014 The Committee encourages the Department to expand and intensify applied research on breast density and im-proved screening tools to detect cancer in patients with dense tis-sue. The Secretary is encouraged to explore whether mammog-raphy reports should indicate to patients if they have dense breast tissue. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [ME/CFS].\u2014 The Committee supports the Department's ME/CFS Advisory Committee [CFSAC] and is concerned that those with ME/CFS have very limited access to clin-ical care and there are no FDA approved treatments for them. HHS is encouraged to use the CFSAC to accelerate progress on research, education, training, care, and services to better address the needs of over one million Americans suffering from ME/CFS. Chronic Pain .\u2014The Committee remains concerned about the public health epidemic of chronic pain. The Committee is pleased with the Department's release of the National Pain Strategy and encourages the Secretary to implement efforts across all relevant HHS agencies and in coordination with the DOD and VA. Given the seriousness of this public health epidemic and its relationship to the opioid crisis, the Committee requests an update on imple-mentation efforts within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Diabetes.\u2014 The Committee urges the Secretary to convene a com- mission comprised of healthcare providers, patient advocates and Federal agencies that operate programs that impact the care of people with pre-diabetes and diabetes. The goal of such a commis-sion would be to make recommendations about developing im-proved clinical resources and tools, innovative care models, quality measures and registries, diabetes screening programs and other prevention activities. Drug Resistant Tuberculosis [TB] .\u2014The Committee notes the re- lease of the President's National Action Plan for Combating Multi Drug Resistant TB in December 2016. The Committee encourages the Secretary to prioritize implementation of the plan in coordina-tion with the Federal TB Task Force, CDC and NIH. 151 Evidence-Based Programming .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the uneven capacity of HHS operating divisions to apply and to build evidence that will improve program effectiveness. The Committee believes that the Assistant Secretary of Planning and Evaluation [ASPE] can play a central role in improving evaluation and evidence-based policymaking across the Department by helping all HHS components develop capacity to meet the standards set forth in ACF's Evaluation Policy. The Committee encourages ASPE to help operating divisions adopt cost-effective approaches to build-ing evidence through use of innovative grant designs that support partnerships between service delivery projects and researchers; by leveraging emerging opportunities to use linked data to measure performance and conduct comprehensive, rigorous evaluations at a reasonable cost; and by partnering with philanthropic organiza-tions that focus on improving the use of rigorous research to inform policy. Eye Health.\u2014 The Committee commends the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine for the September 2016 re-lease of its report ''Making Eye Health a Population Health Imper-ative: Vision for Tomorrow'' which includes recommendations re-garding continued leadership by HHS to reduce the burden of vi-sion impairment. The Committee requests an update from the Sec-retary regarding HHS' progress in implementing these rec-ommendations in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Geroscience. \u2014The Committee commends NIA's leadership of the Trans-NIH Geroscience Interest Group, which promotes coordi-nated discussion and action on NIH-funded geroscience research to reduce the burden of age-related diseases. The Committee remains concerned over the rates of chronic disease in the older adult popu-lation and recognizes that accelerated breakthroughs from geroscience research into the biological basis of aging is essential to targeting changes that take place as a result of aging. The Com-mittee urges the Secretary to consider establishing an Interagency Geroscience Research Coordination Committee [IGRCC] comprised of representatives from the NIA, NIAMS, NCI, NEI, NHLBI, NINDS, NIGMS, NHGRI, CDC, FDA, DOD, VA, and EPA. The goal of the IGRCC would be to identify and direct grants for new geroscience research. Global Health Research Strategy. \u2014The Committee requests an update on how CDC, FDA, BARDA, and NIH jointly coordinate global health research activities with specific measurable metrics used to track progress toward agreed upon health goals. Opioid Medical Record Reporting.\u2014 The Committee is deeply con- cerned about the devastating impact that the opioid epidemic is having on families throughout the country, and recognizes that medical providers must have access to information about their pa-tients' past opioid addiction if that information is provided by the patient. The Committee encourages the Secretary to develop and disseminate standards that would allow hospitals and physicians to access the history of opioid addiction in medical records (including electronic health records) of any patient who has provided informa-tion about such addiction to a healthcare provider. Opioid Response.\u2014 The Committee believes that the Federal re- sponse to the opioid epidemic will be most effective if resources 152 made available through the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act [CARA] and related programs are directed to strategies that are backed by strong evidence or to innovative and promising ap-proaches that will be rigorously evaluated to learn their impact. In implementing new and existing programs that address the opioid epidemic, the Department is encouraged to utilize evidence-based policymaking principles, tools, and program designs such as those disseminated by the Evidence-Based Policymaking Collaborative. The Committee encourages HHS to collaborate with outside re-searchers and philanthropic organizations that focus on improving the use of rigorous research to inform policy. Pharmacy Dispensing.\u2014 The Committee is concerned by recent reports about the rate at which dangerous drug combinations are dispensed, especially in the context of the opioid epidemic, and en-courages the Department to research as part of its National Action Plan for Adverse Drug Event Prevention how pharmacy practices can prevent harmful drug interactions. Further, the Committee en-courages collaboration between the CDC, FDA, DEA, AHRQ, phar-macy regulatory and oversight organizations, and patient safety or-ganizations on the prevention of harmful drug interactions. Prenatal Opioid Use Disorders and Neonatal Abstinence Syn- drome. \u2014The Committee is aware that the Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015 requires the Secretary to conduct a review of the De-partment's planning and coordination activities related to prenatal opioid use disorders and neonatal abstinence syndrome, as well as address gaps in research and treatment. The act also requires the Secretary to develop recommendations for preventing and treating prenatal opioid use disorders and neonatal abstinence syndrome. The Committee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Public Access.\u2014 The Committee commends HHS Operating Divi- sions that have issued plans in response to the directive issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to support increased public access to the results of research funded by the Federal Government. The Committee encourages the Department to continue its efforts towards full implementation of the directive, and requests that an update on progress made be included in its fiscal year 2019 CJ. Public Health in Indian Country.\u2014 The Committee supports the Secretary's current initiatives to address public health crises such as viral hepatitis, HIV/AIDS and opioids, that disproportionally im-pact Indian County. The Committee requests that HHS provide an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Pulmonary Hypertension [PH] .\u2014The Committee remains con- cerned that most PH patients are not diagnosed for many years until the condition has reached a catastrophic stage, which leads to significant disability, greatly increased mortality, and the need for costly and dramatic medical interventions, such as heart-lung transplantation. Given the availability of effective therapies for early-stage PH, the Department is encouraged to work across agen-cies and with the patient and professional community to prepare recommendations to improve early diagnosis and treatment of PH. Rural Communities.\u2014 The Committee encourages the Secretary to ensure that rural concerns and challenges are adequately rep-153 resented in the Department's policies, programs, and activities, in- cluding policies related to the opioid epidemic. The Committee re-quests that the Secretary include a status of these activities in the fiscal year 2019 CJ. Surgeon General Report on Poverty.\u2014 The Committee notes that too many children still live in poverty, compromising their ability to be healthy, succeed in school and raise healthy families them-selves. A report by the Surgeon General on improving the health of children could increase awareness and generate additional effort on ameliorating this public health problem. Technical Assistance [TA].\u2014 The Committee and the Depart- ment's budget office have had a long-standing relationship that al-lows the Committee to receive legal and technical feedback on funding proposals. The Committee relies on TA to ensure that pro-grams and funding initiatives can be implemented as intended. The Committee expects its TA requests to be dealt with in a manner that is consistent with past precedent, including timely answers that respond to the Committee's specific inquiries. United States/Mexico Border .\u2014The Committee urges the Depart- ment to continue its efforts to conduct border infectious disease surveillance in order to identify and implement needed prevention and treatment. The Department could focus on priority surveil-lance, epidemiology and preparedness activities along the borders in order to be able to respond to potential outbreaks and epidemics, including those caused by potential bioterrorism agents. Vector Control.\u2014 The Committee continues to support HHS's pre- paredness and response efforts to control outbreaks of Zika virus infection and the Committee supports continued collaboration amongst the CDC, NIH, FDA, BARDA, DOD, USAID, USDA, DHS, and VA. The Committee notes recent reports showing some infants born without microcephaly develop it later in life or develop other neurological problems. HHS should continue to research and mon-itor these infants and work closely with the vector control units across the country to limit the spread of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. In an effort to foster greater coordination, collaboration and transparency across agency lines, the Committee urges the Secretary to establish a coordinating office to facilitate and expe-dite the Government's response to vector-borne disease threats, in-cluding combating the spread of disease through innovative vector control technologies. Zika.\u2014 The Committee remains concerned about the multiple threats posed by the Zika virus, including health threats to infants exposed to the virus. The Committee encourages the Secretary to continue surveillance of the disease along with efforts to further de-velop diagnostics and a vaccine. Teen Pregnancy Prevention The Committee recommendation includes $101,000,000 for the Teen Pregnancy Prevention [TPP] program. This program supports competitive grants to public and private entities to replicate evi-dence-based teen pregnancy prevention approaches. 154 Office of Minority Health The Committee recommends $56,670,000 for the Office of Minor- ity Health [OMH]. This Office focuses on strategies designed to de-crease health disparities and to improve the health status of racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States. OMH estab-lishes goals and coordinates all departmental activity related to im-proving health outcomes for disadvantaged and minority individ-uals. Health Disparities.\u2014 The Committee believes that a comprehen- sive coordinated focus by OMH, HRSA and NIMHD will increase the probability of reducing health disparities. This coordinated focus should examine the factors that lead to health disparities, in-cluding but not limited to age, nutrition, medical conditions, and availability of medical support and an appropriate healthcare work-force in both underserved urban and rural settings. HHS is encour-aged to partner with community-based organizations that are cur-rently providing medical and nutritional support. HIV Community-Based Testing Programs. \u2014The Committee rec- ognizes that several community-based programs have encouraged individuals at risk for HIV/AIDS to utilize FDA-approved home- based HIV testing technology to monitor their HIV status. The Committee continues to urge the OMH to consider a pilot or dem-onstration program within existing resources to gauge the effective-ness of this approach. HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C.\u2014 The Committee continues to be concerned about the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community, and is aware of the concurrent high rates of co-infec-tion with Hepatitis C as outlined by the HHS 2015 Forum on Hep-atitis C in African American Communities. The Committee encour-ages OMH to work aggressively to address opportunities to reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C by exploring partnerships for screening and implementing community engagement programs. Lupus Initiative. \u2014The Committee continues to support the OMH National Health Education Lupus Program and its efforts to de-velop a clinical trial education and implementation plan for lupus. The action plan will focus on developing public-private and commu-nity partnerships, evaluating current minority clinical trial edu-cation and participation programs, and developing a research plan for creating new clinical trial education models in lupus. This will inform the development of the broader actionable lupus clinical trial education plan. Sexual Risk Avoidance The Committee recommends $25,000,000 for sexual risk avoid- ance education. This is a competitive grant program that funds evi-denced based abstinence models for adolescents. Funding for competitive grants for sexual risk avoidance shall use medically accurate information referenced to peer-reviewed publications by educational, scientific, governmental, or health or-ganizations; implement an evidence-based approach; and teach the benefits associated with self-regulation, success sequencing for pov-erty prevention, healthy relationships, goal setting, and resisting sexual coercion, dating violence, and other youth risk behaviors. 155 Office of Women's Health The Committee recommends $32,140,000 for the Office of Wom- en's Health [OWH]. This office develops, stimulates, and coordi-nates women's health research, healthcare services, and public and healthcare professional education across the Department. It ad-vances important crosscutting initiatives and develops public-pri-vate partnerships, providing leadership and policy direction to ad-dress the disparities in women's health. The Committee recommendation includes $3,100,000 to combat violence against women through the State partnership initiative. This program provides funding to State-level public and private health programs to partner with domestic and sexual violence orga-nizations to improve healthcare providers' ability to help victims of violence and improve prevention programs.

PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES EMERGENCY FUND Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $1,532,958,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 1,662,616,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,552,958,000 The Committee recommends $1,552,958,000 for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. This appropriation supports the activities of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response [ASPR] and other components within the Office of the Secretary to prepare for the health consequences of bioter-rorism and other public health emergencies, including pandemic in-fluenza. It also provides funding for the Department's cybersecurity efforts. Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response The Committee recommendation includes $1,396,628,000 for ac- tivities administered by ASPR. This Office was created by the Pan-demic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act [PAHPA] to lead the De-partment's activities regarding preventing, preparing for, and re-sponding to public health emergencies, including disasters and acts of terrorism. National Disaster Medical System. \u2014The Committee continues bill language providing coverage under the Federal Employees Compensation Act for National Disaster Medical System intermit-tent employees who are activated for training or deployment. Hospital Preparedness Program The Committee's recommendation includes $254,555,000 for the Hospital Preparedness Program [HPP]. This program provides grants to States to build healthcare coalitions that enhance re-gional and local hospital preparedness and improve overall surge capacity in public health emergencies. The Committee recognizes the vital importance of this program in helping communities re-spond to tragic events, for this reason the Committee includes the same funding level as fiscal year 2017. While the Committee ac-knowledges the need to incorporate risk, the Committee rejects the administration proposal to change the allocation formula that would leave 26 States and territories without HPP funding. The Committee believes this funding should be carefully coordinated within communities to continue to provide our Nation's hospitals and emergency responders the necessary tools to respond quickly and collaboratively to these and other public health emergencies that are inevitable in our Nation's communities. Rural Areas. \u2014The Committee encourages ASPR to ensure that hospital systems in remote and rural areas are benefiting from this program and are prepared in cases of emergencies, epidemics, or natural disasters. 158 Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority [BARDA] The Committee recommendation includes $511,700,000 for ad- vanced research and development. The Committee commends BARDA for supporting advanced de- velopment efforts of industry to develop vaccines, diagnostics, drugs, and therapeutics to minimize serious threats of infectious disease and urges BARDA to continue to invest in the development of countermeasures for infectious diseases through the CARB ini-tiative and the Emerging Infectious Disease program. Blood Platelet .\u2014The Committee is aware of BARDA's investiga- tion into blood platelet-derived medical counter-measures as a he-mostatic agent, and urges BARDA to expand its research to ad-dress the opportunities that cell stabilization of blood platelets pro-vides, including radiation exposure remediation, acute burn heal-ing, drug delivery, hemorrhagic fevers, and diagnostic imaging. Infectious Diseases. \u2014The Committee commends BARDA for sup- porting advanced development efforts to develop vaccines, diagnostics, drugs, and therapeutics to minimize serious threats of infectious diseases. BARDA is encouraged to continue to proactively prepare for emerging infectious disease outbreaks, in-cluding investing in rapid screening technology. Tuberculosis.\u2014 The National Strategy for CARB identified drug resistant TB as a serious threat level pathogen and new diagnostic, treatment and prevention tools are urgently needed to address this global health threat. The Committee encourages BARDA to support the development of new TB diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines through the CARB initiative, and the Emerging Infectious Disease program. Vector-Borne Disease Control.\u2014 The Committee is aware that since the enactment of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Prepared-ness Act, BARDA has led efforts to define, develop, and acquire medical countermeasures to reduce the threats of public health emergencies such as Zika. The Committee encourages BARDA to explore innovative vector control technologies that provide imme-diate opportunities for countermeasure development to address the non-native Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito population in ways that are environmentally friendly and that may reach places where many pesticides cannot. Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund The Committee recommendation includes $510,000,000 for the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund. The Committee is com-mitted to ensuring the Nation is adequately prepared against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear attacks.

Of the total, $17,000,000 is provided in annual funding and $75,000,000 in no-year funding. Office of Security and Strategic Information The Committee includes $7,470,000 for the Office of Security and Strategic Information to maintain the security of the Department's personnel, systems, and critical infrastructure. PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH FUND In fiscal year 2018, the level transferred from the fund after ac- counting for sequestration is $840,600,000.

(162) TITLE III DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EDUCATION FOR THE DISADVANTAGED Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $16,143,790,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 16,347,558,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 16,169,198,000 The Committee recommends an appropriation of $16,169,198,000 for education for the disadvantaged. The programs in the Education for the Disadvantaged account provide a foundation of support to help ensure that all children re-ceive a high-quality education. Funds appropriated in this account primarily support activities in the 2018-2019 school year. Grants to Local Educational Agencies Title I grants to local educational agencies [LEAs] provide sup- plemental education funding, especially in high-poverty areas, for local programs that provide extra academic support to help raise the achievement of eligible students or, in the case of school-wide programs, help all students in high-poverty schools meet chal-lenging State academic standards. Title I grants are distributed through four formulas: basic, concentration, targeted, and edu-cation finance incentive grant. The Committee recommends $15,485,210,000 for the title I grants to LEAs program. Of the funds available for title I grants to LEAs, up to $5,000,000 shall be available on October 1, 2017 for transfer to the Census Bureau for poverty updates; $5,251,398,000 will become available on July 1, 2018; and $10,841,177,000 will be-come available on October 1, 2018. The funds that become avail-able on July 1, 2018, and October 1, 2018, will remain available for obligation through September 30, 2019. Further Opportunities for Children to Unlock Success [FOCUS].\u2014 The Committee recommendation does not include fund- ing for a new FOCUS grants program or new language requested that would authorize the Department to establish new require-ments on local educational agencies interested in participating in the Flexibility for Equitable Per-Pupil Funding authority in Part F of Title I of ESEA. The Committee believes significant changes such as this to this recently-reauthorized law should be made as needed through legislation considered by the authorizing Commit-tees of Congress. Neglected, Delinquent, and At-Risk Youth.\u2014 On any given day, tens of thousands of young people are in the custody of the juvenile justice system. The Committee believes ESSA made significant progress in addressing the needs of neglected, delinquent, and at- risk youth and ensuring greater access to educational services upon 163 re-entry. While the Committee believes ESSA was a strong step to- wards a better re-entry system for youth who encounter the juve-nile justice system, it is essential that the Department monitor and ensure compliance with the re-entry activities required under ESSA. Within 180 days of enactment of this act, the Secretary is directed to submit a report to the Committee describing how each State is meeting the re-entry requirements for youth included in ESSA. Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grants The Committee recommendation includes $190,000,000 for the Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grants program. This program provides competitive grants to State educational agencies [SEAs] that then subgrant at least 95 percent of such funds to eli-gible entities to support efforts to improve literacy instruction in high-need schools and early education programs in a State for each of several age bands ranging from birth through 12th grade. Innovative Approaches to Literacy The Committee recommendation includes $27,000,000 for the In- novative Approaches to Literacy program. This program provides competitive grants to national not-for-profit organizations and school libraries for providing books and childhood literacy activities to children and families living in high-need communities. The Committee continues to direct the Department to reserve no less than 50 percent of funds under this program for grants to de-velop and enhance effective school library programs, which may in-clude providing professional development to school librarians, books, and up-to-date materials to high-need schools. Further, the Committee continues to direct the Department to ensure that grants are distributed among eligible entities that will serve geo-graphically diverse areas, including rural areas. Migrant Education Program The Committee recommends $374,751,000 for the title I Migrant Education program. This funding supports grants to SEAs for programs to meet the special educational needs of the children of migratory agricultural workers or migratory fishworkers. Funding also supports activities to improve interstate and intrastate coordination of migrant edu-cation programs, as well as identify and improve services to the mi-grant student population. Neglected and Delinquent The Committee recommends $47,614,000 for the title I Neglected and Delinquent program. This program provides financial assistance to SEAs for education services to neglected and delinquent children and youth in State- run institutions and for juveniles in adult correctional institutions. States are authorized to set aside at least 15 percent, but not more than 30 percent, of their Neglected and Delinquent funds to help students in State-operated institutions make the transition into lo-cally operated programs and to support the successful reentry of 164 youth offenders who are age 20 or younger and have received a sec- ondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent. Special Programs for Migrant Students The Committee recommends $44,623,000 for Special Programs for Migrant Students, which consist of HEP and CAMP. HEP projects are 5-year grants to institutions of higher edu- cation and other nonprofit organizations to recruit migrant stu-dents ages 16 and older and provide the academic and support services needed to help them obtain a high school equivalency cer-tificate and subsequently gain employment, attain admission to a postsecondary institution or a job training program, or join the military. CAMP projects are 5-year grants to institutions of higher edu- cation and nonprofit organizations to provide tutoring, counseling, and financial assistance to migrant students during their first year of postsecondary education. I MPACT AID Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. 2018 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,340,112,000 The Committee recommends $1,340,112,000 for the Impact Aid program. Impact Aid provides financial assistance to school districts af- fected by the presence of Federal activities and federally owned land. These school districts face unique challenges because they must educate children living on federally owned land, such as mili-tary bases, while federally owned property is also exempt from local taxes, a primary source of revenue for local school districts. The Committee bill retains language that provides for continued eligibility for students affected by the deployment or death of their military parent, as long as these children still attend schools in the same school district. Basic Support Payments .\u2014The Committee recommends $1,200,242,000 for the Basic Support Payments program. Under this statutory formula, payments are made on behalf of all cat-egories of federally connected children, with a priority placed on making payments first to heavily impacted school districts and pro-viding any remaining funds for regular basic support payments. Payments for Children With Disabilities .\u2014The Committee bill in- cludes $48,316,000 for Payments for Children With Disabilities. Under this program, additional payments are made for certain fed-erally connected children eligible for services under IDEA. Facilities Maintenance .\u2014The Committee recommends $4,835,000 for Facilities Maintenance. This activity provides funding for emer-gency repairs and comprehensive capital improvements to certain school facilities owned by the Department and used by LEAs to serve federally connected military dependent students. Funds ap-propriated for this purpose are available until expended. Construction .\u2014The Committee recommends $17,406,000 for eligi- ble LEAs for school construction activities allocated by formula under section 7007(a) of ESEA. 165 Payments for Federal Property .\u2014The Committee recommends $69,313,000 for Payments for Federal Property. These payments compensate LEAs specifically for revenue lost due to the removal of Federal property from local tax rolls, regardless of whether any federally connected children attend schools in the district. The budget request proposed eliminating this program. The Committee recommendation again rejects this elimination and continues to note that this funding represents a key component of fulfilling the Federal Government's commitment to school districts impacted by the presence of federally owned land. S CHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $4,408,567,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 697,231,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,458,567,000 The Committee recommendation includes $4,458,567,000 for the School Improvement Programs account. Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants The Committee recommends $2,055,830,000 for Supporting Effec- tive Instruction State Grants. The appropriation for this program primarily supports activities associated with the 2018-2019 aca-demic year. Of the funds provided, $374,389,000 will become avail-able on July 1, 2018, and $1,681,441,000 will become available on October 1, 2018. These funds will remain available for obligation through September 30, 2019. States and LEAs may use funds for a range of activities related to the certification, recruitment, professional development, and support of teachers and administrators. Activities may include re-forming teacher certification and licensure requirements, address-ing alternative routes to State certification of teachers, recruiting teachers and principals, and implementing teacher mentoring sys-tems, teacher testing, merit pay, and merit-based performance sys-tems. These funds may also be used by districts to hire teachers to reduce class sizes. The Committee continues to strongly encourage the Department to issue clear guidance specifically on the importance of strong school leadership, and how States can use existing title II-A re-sources, including through the optional 3 percent State set-aside, to support principals and school leadership, including examples of best practices. Supplemental Education Grants The Committee recommendation includes $16,699,000 for supple- mental education grants to the Republic of Marshall Islands [RMI] and the Federated States of Micronesia [FSM]. This grant program was authorized by the Compact of Free Asso- ciation Amendments Act of 2003. These funds will be transferred from the Department to the Secretary of the Interior for grants to these entities. The Committee bill includes language requested in the budget that allows the Secretary of Education to reserve 5 per-cent of these funds to provide FSM and RMI with technical assist-ance. 166 21st Century Community Learning Centers The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,191,673,000 for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers [21st CCLC] program. Funds are allocated to States by formula, which in turn, award at least 95 percent of their allocations to LEAs, community-based organizations, and other public and private entities. Grantees use these resources to establish or expand community learning centers that provide activities offering significant extended learning oppor-tunities, such as before- and after-school programs, recreational ac-tivities, drug and violence prevention, and family literacy programs for students and related services to their families. Centers must target their services to students who attend schools that are eligi-ble to operate a school-wide program under title I of the ESEA or serve high percentages of students from low-income families. State Assessments Grants The Committee recommends $369,100,000 for the State Assess- ments Grants program. This program provides formula grants to States for developing and implementing standards and assessments required by the ESEA and helping States and LEAs carry out audits of their as-sessment systems to eliminate low-quality or duplicative assess-ments. It also provides competitive grants to States, including con-sortia of States, to improve the quality, validity, and reliability of academic assessments. Education for Homeless Children and Youth For carrying out education activities authorized by title VII, sub- title B of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, the Com-mittee recommends $77,000,000. This program provides assistance to each State to support an of- fice of the coordinator of education for homeless children and youth, to develop and implement State plans for educating home-less children, and to make subgrants to LEAs to support the edu-cation of those children. Grants are made to States based on the total that each State receives in title I grants to LEAs. Under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Children and Youth Pro- gram, SEAs must ensure that homeless children and youth have equal access to the same free public education, including a public preschool education, as is provided to other children and youth. Training and Advisory Services For Training and Advisory Services authorized by title IV of the Civil Rights Act, the Committee recommends $6,575,000. The funds provided will support awards to operate regional eq- uity assistance centers [EACs]. Each EAC provides services to school districts upon request. Activities include disseminating in-formation on successful practices and legal requirements related to nondiscrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin in education programs. 167 Native Hawaiian Education The Committee recommendation includes $33,397,000 for Native Hawaiian Education. The Committee bill continues a provision that allows funding provided by this program to be used for construction. Alaska Native Education The Committee recommends $32,453,000 for the Alaska Native Education. These funds help address the unique educational needs of Alaska Native schoolchildren. Funds are used for the development of sup-plemental educational programs to benefit Alaska Natives. The Committee bill continues language that allows funding provided by this program to be used for construction. The Committee bill also includes language overriding the authorizing statute's requirement to make noncompetitive awards to certain organizations. The Committee continues to direct the Department to ensure that Alaska Native tribes, Alaska Native regional non-profits, and Alaska Native corporations have the maximum opportunity to suc-cessfully compete for grants under this program by providing these entities multiple opportunities for technical assistance in devel-oping successful applications for these funds, both in Alaska and via various forms of telecommunications. Further, the Committee continues to direct the Department to make every effort to ensure that Alaska Natives and Alaskans represent a significant propor-tion of peer reviewers for grant applications submitted under this program. Rural Education The Committee recommends $175,840,000 for rural education programs. The Committee expects that rural education funding will be equally divided between the Small, Rural School Achievement Pro-gram, which provides funds to LEAs that serve a small number of students, and the Rural and Low-Income School Program, which provides funds to LEAs that serve concentrations of poor students, regardless of the number of students served. The Committee recognizes that the Department's new application requirement for local education agencies to access Rural Education Achievement Program [REAP] funding in fiscal year 2017 pre-vented some eligible LEAs from accessing grant funding under this program. The Committee directs the Department to simplify the REAP application process, eliminate unnecessary administrative burdens, and directly engage with eligible LEAs and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that the Department's requirements accom-modate the unique needs of these small, rural, and remote schools. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Department to use any unobligated available funding to make awards to LEAs who re-ceived a grant in fiscal year 2016, but failed to initially submit an application for fiscal year 2017 due to demonstrable administrative burden, provided they submit an application for funding. 168 Comprehensive Centers The Committee recommends $50,000,000 for the Comprehensive Centers program. These funds provide support to a network of comprehensive cen- ters that are operated by research organizations, agencies, institu-tions of higher education, or partnerships thereof, and provide training and technical assistance on various issues to States, LEAs, and schools as identified through needs assessments undertaken in each region. The system currently includes 15 regional centers, which are charged with providing intensive technical assistance to SEAs to increase their capacity to assist LEAs and schools with meeting the goals of the ESEA, and 8 content centers, which are organized by topic area. In selecting priorities for a new cohort of comprehensive centers, the Committee continues to direct the Department to recognize the unique challenges, emphasized in ESSA, affecting rural schools. The Committee strongly encourages the Department to establish at least one university-led center in a State with a significant percent-age of students in rural schools. Such a center could focus on rural education and provide assistance to rural districts that serve high poverty and minority students. The Committee recommendation includes continued support for a comprehensive center, first funded in fiscal year 2016 and as au-thorized in ESSA, on students at risk of not attaining full literacy skills due to a disability, including dyslexia, or developmental delay. Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants The Committee recommendation includes $450,000,000 for Stu- dent Support and Academic Enrichment Grants. This program pro-vides formula grants to States, which then sub-grant to LEAs, to help support activities to provide students with a well-rounded edu-cation, ensure safe and supportive learning environments, and use technology to improve instruction. The Committee recommendation maintains bill language in- cluded in fiscal year 2017 giving States the option to subgrant funds to LEAs, or a consortia of LEAs, on a competitive basis. I NDIAN EDUCATION Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $164,939,000 Budget estimate, 2018 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 165,239,000 The Committee recommends $165,239,000 for Indian education programs. Grants to Local Educational Agencies For grants to LEAs, the Committee recommends $100,381,000. These funds provide financial support to elementary and secondary school programs that serve Indian students, including preschool children. Funds are awarded on a formula basis to LEAs, schools supported and operated by the Department of the Interior/Bureau of Indian Education, and in some cases directly to Indian tribes. 169 Special Programs for Indian Children The Committee recommends $57,993,000 for special programs for Indian children. Funds are used for demonstration grants to improve Indian stu- dent achievement from early childhood education through college preparation programs, and for professional development grants for training Indians who are preparing to begin careers in teaching and school administration. Within the total, the Committee recommendation includes $43,952,000 for the Native Youth Community Projects initiative, the same as the fiscal year level. National Activities The Committee recommends $6,865,000 for national activities. Funds are used to expand efforts to improve research, evaluation, and data collection on the status and effectiveness of Indian edu-cation programs, and to continue grants to tribal educational de-partments for education administration and planning. The Committee continues to note that there are significant cog- nitive, psychological, and academic benefits that result from Native American language immersion programs. Schools where the indige-nous language is the primary language of instruction have a strong, positive effect on the educational and social outcomes of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian students compared to schools where Native students are taught in English. In addition, language education programs are essential for tribal self-determination. Within the total, the Committee recommenda-tion includes no less than $1,908,000, an increase of $300,000 above the fiscal year 2017 funding level, for Native American lan-guage immersion programs authorized under section 6133 of ESSA. The Committee also intends that funds available for carrying out Section 6133 be allocated to all types of eligible entities in a way that supports the most extensive possible distribution across geog-raphy and language diversity and supports both existing and new Native language immersion programs and schools. Further, the Committee directs the Department to give the same consideration to applicants that propose to provide partial immersion schools and programs as to full immersion, as the local tribes, schools, and other applicants know best what type of program will most effec-tively assist their youth to succeed. The Committee notes that Native American languages hold a unique place in our nation and that the Native American Lan- guages Act of 1990 [NALA] articulates U.S. policy toward Native American languages. Since its passage, Native American languages have increasingly become the object of school and community revi-talization and retention efforts aligned with NALA. Educating stu-dents in the medium of a Native American language has dem-onstrated the same benefits as study in other world languages, in-cluding improved learning outcomes and enhanced cognitive ability. In the case of Native American students, however, the outstanding results in student achievement, high school graduation, and college attainment rates produced through access to Native American lan-guage medium education schools and programs are lifting some of the most disadvantaged youth in the U.S. to the ranks of the most 170 academically successful. The Committee recognizes that the estab- lishment of a Native American Language Center to function as a consortium for institutions of higher education that have signifi-cant experience and expertise in Native American languages and Native American language medium education would be a strong way to provide nationwide coordination for Native American lan-guage activities. In addition, it could promote best practices, de-velop curricular materials for Native American languages, dissemi-nate high-quality research on the efficacy of programs of instruc-tion in these languages, and serve as an information clearinghouse and hub for distance learning and continuing professional develop-ment in Native American language education. Further, such a cen-ter could provide benefits to practitioners at schools from the Pre- K to PhD levels who teach through the medium of a Native Amer-ican language, and include Native American scholars and staff who are fluent in Native American languages and have the dem-onstrated capacity to reach out and collaborate with Native Amer-ican communities. The Committee therefore directs the Department to provide to the Committee a report on the feasibility of desig-nating such a center and the potential associated costs. I NNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $887,575,000 Budget estimate, 2018 1,208,026,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 880,375,000 The Committee recommends $880,375,000 for programs within the Innovation and Improvement account. Education Innovation and Research The Committee recommendation includes $95,000,000 for the Education Innovation and Research [EIR] program. This program supports the creation, development, implementation, replication, and scaling up of evidence-based, field-initiated innovations de-signed to improve student achievement and attainment for high- need students. EIR incorporates a tiered evidence framework that provides early-phase, mid-phase, and expansion and replication grants. This supports interventions throughout the pipeline, from smaller grants for early stage projects that are willing to undergo rigorous evaluation to test their efficacy to larger grants to scale- up proven-effective interventions that have demonstrated signifi-cant impacts through multiple rigorous evaluations. The Committee notes that the EIR program is authorized to fund evidence-based, field-initiated innovations to improve student achievement for high-need students. Accordingly, the Committee directs the Department to ensure that funds are used for projects in a range of topic areas, based on the needs of local communities as determined by field initiated proposals, and that funds are not focused or designated for any particular intervention. Further, the Committee recommendation does not include new bill language re-quested under this program and believes changes proposed to the recently reauthorized ESEA should be made as needed through leg-islation considered by the authorizing Committees of Congress. The Committee supports the 25 percent set-aside in ESSA for EIR grants to benefit rural areas. Further, the Committee encour-171 ages the Department to invest in early-phase grants that benefit the expansion of education and experiences for educators and stu-dents located in rural schools with limited access to advanced science courses. Programs could include professional development for teachers, lessons taught by scientific experts, and hands-on ex-perience with technology. School Leader Recruitment and Support The Committee recommendation does not include funding for the School Leader Recruitment and Support program, which funds ac-tivities to improve the recruitment, placement, support, and reten-tion of effective principals and other school leaders in high-need schools. ESSA included new provisions to promote the use of title I and title II-A funds to support principals and school leaders, in-cluding an optional 3 percent State set-aside of title II-A funds for such activities. These State formula funds, as well as funding through other competitive grant programs such as the Supporting Effective Educator Development [SEED] program, can be used to support similar activities as those previously funded by this pro-gram. Charter School Program The Committee recommends $367,172,000 for the Charter School Program. This program supports the start-up, replication, and ex-pansion of high-quality charter schools. Within the total, the Committee recommendation includes $212,872,000 for grants to State entities to support high-quality charter schools, including for grants directly to charter school de-velopers in a State if no State entity receives a grant; $110,000,000 for grants to charter management organizations for the replication and expansion of high-quality charter schools; $31,000,000 for fa-cilities financing assistance, of which not less than $21,000,000 shall be for the Credit Enhancement program; and not less than $11,000,000 for national activities to provide technical assistance, disseminate best practices, and evaluate the impact of the charter school program. Within the total for grants to SEAs, the Committee recommenda- tion includes no less than $5,000,000 for developer grants to estab-lish or expand charter schools in underserved, high-poverty, rural areas. This could include grants to institutions of higher education, or non-profit organizations in partnership with institutions of high-er education, which are located in the region and committed to im-proving educational outcomes for underserved rural students. Rural areas present a host of challenges for all types of schools, in-cluding charter schools. Institutions of higher education located in the area may be uniquely suited to help address some of these challenges, and to give students opportunities to learn in non-tradi-tional settings. Further, dedicated funding to expand charter schools in rural areas could help expand the evidence-base, includ-ing developing curriculum, for charter schools in rural areas. The Committee also notes that establishing charter schools in rural, particularly underserved areas, will likely require more start-up costs than in some other areas, and encourages the Department to consider these factors in determining grant award levels. 172 Magnet Schools Assistance The Committee recommends $97,647,000 for the Magnet Schools Assistance program. This program supports grants to LEAs to establish and operate magnet schools that are part of a court-ordered or federally ap-proved voluntary desegregation plan. Magnet schools are designed to attract substantial numbers of students from different social, economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds. Grantees may use funds for planning and promotional materials; salaries of instructional staff; transportation, as long as such expenses are sustainable be-yond the grant period and not a significant portion of the grant; and the purchase of technology, educational materials, and equip-ment. Arts in Education The Committee recommendation includes $27,000,000 for the Arts in Education program. The funding is used for competitive awards for national nonprofit organizations engaged in arts edu-cation, professional development activities, and model arts edu-cation programs. Funds also are used for evaluation and dissemina-tion activities. Javits Gifted and Talented Students The Committee recommendation includes $12,000,000 for the Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education program. Funds are used for awards to State and local educational agencies, institu-tions of higher education, and other public and private agencies for research, demonstration, and technical assistance activities de-signed to enhance the capability of elementary and secondary schools to meet the special educational needs of gifted and talented students, including those from disadvantaged and underrep-resented populations. American History and Civics Education The Committee recommendation includes $1,815,000 for Presi- dential and Congressional Academies for American History and Civics. Presidential Academies for the Teaching of American His-tory and Civics offer residential workshops to elementary and sec-ondary school teachers to strengthen their knowledge through in-struction and interaction with primary scholars and accomplished teachers in these fields. The Congressional Academies for Students of American History and Civics provide similar workshops to stu-dents to enrich their understanding of American history and civics. The Committee recommendation does not include funding for Na- tional Activities authorized under section 2233 of ESSA. Teacher and School Leader Incentive Grants The Committee recommendation includes $187,000,000 for Teacher and School Leader Incentive Grants. This program provides competitive grants to eligible entities to develop, implement, improve, or expand human capital manage-ment systems or performance-based compensation systems in schools. Funds can be used for a wide-range of activities, including developing or improving evaluation and support systems that are 173 based in part on student achievement; providing principals with necessary tools to make school-level decisions; implementing a dif-ferentiated salary structure based on a variety of factors; improving the recruitment and retaining of effective teachers, principals, and other school leaders; and instituting career advancement opportu-nities that reward effective teachers, principals and other school leaders. Ready-To-Learn Television The Committee recommendation includes $27,741,000 for the Ready-to-Learn Television program. This program is designed to facilitate student academic achieve- ment by leveraging the power and reach of public television to de-velop and distribute educational video programming for preschool and elementary school children and their parents. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 requires the Depart- ment to transfer $2,000,000 to the Ready to Learn program in fis-cal year 2017 to address a shortfall in funding relative to initial grant award amounts. The Committee recommendation continues that funding in the Ready to Learn program in fiscal year 2018. This funding will help grantees meet their project objectives and successfully produce the high quality educational programming in-tended by Congress. The Department shall provide each grantee a proportional share of such funds based on the grantees' initial budget submissions. Supporting Effective Educator Development The Committee recommendation includes $65,000,000 for the Supporting Effective Educator Development [SEED] program. SEED provides competitive grants to improve teacher and principal effectiveness by supporting pathways that help teachers, principals, or other school leaders with non-traditional preparation and certifi-cation obtain employment in underserved LEAs; providing evi-dence-based professional development; and making services and learning opportunities freely available to LEAs. S AFESCHOOLS AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 134,857,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 131,254,000 The Committee recommends a total of $131,254,000 for activities to promote safe schools, healthy students, and citizenship edu-cation. Promise Neighborhoods The Committee recommendation includes $73,254,000 for the Promise Neighborhoods program. This program awards competitive grants to not-for-profit, community-based organizations for the de-velopment of comprehensive neighborhood programs designed to combat the effects of poverty and improve educational and life out-comes for children and youth, from birth through college. Each Promise Neighborhood grantee serves a high-poverty urban neigh-borhood or rural community. 174 The Committee recommendation modifies bill language included last year regarding Promise Neighborhood extension grants and di-rects the Department to award two-year extension grants on a com-petitive basis no later than March 31, 2018 to high quality Promise Neighborhood programs that have demonstrated positive and prom-ising results through their initial implementation grant and that propose to continue pursuing ambitious goals through an extension of that grant. The Committee expects that grantees would be eligi-ble for extension grants in an amount to allow them to continue to pursue ambitious goals while also supporting sustainability plan-ning. Further, the Committee expects that a funding opportunity announcement will be published promptly with funding awarded as soon as possible, no later than March 31, 2018, to limit disruption and uncertainties for grantees. Finally, the Committee encourages the Department to prioritize funding for programs operating in par-ticularly underserved areas. School Safety National Activities The Committee recommendation includes $58,000,000 for the School Safety National Activities, including up to $5,000,000 for Project SERV. This funding will help schools address the con-sequences of their students witnessing or being the victim of vio-lence and other root causes of unhealthy school climates. Full Service Community Schools The Committee recommendation does not include funding for Full Service Community Schools. E NGLISH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $737,400,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 735,998,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 737,400,000 The Committee recommends an appropriation of $737,400,000 for the English Language Acquisition program. The Department makes formula grants to States based on each State's share of the Nation's limited-English-proficient and recent immigrant student population. The program is designed to increase the capacity of States and school districts to address the needs of these students. The authorizing statute requires that 6.5 percent of the appropriation be used to support national activities, which in-clude professional development activities designed to increase the number of highly qualified teachers serving limited-English-pro-ficient students; a National Clearinghouse for English Language Acquisition and Language Instructional Programs. National activi-ties funds shall be available for 2 years. The Committee strongly encourages the Department to help make States, school districts, and schools aware of funding avail-able, through this program and others, to improve the English lan-guage proficiency and academic achievement of English language learners. The Committee notes the Department issued non-regu-latory guidance on this issue in 2016. 175 SPECIAL EDUCATION Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $13,064,358,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 12,942,126,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 13,066,858,000 The Committee recommends an appropriation of $13,066,858,000 for special education programs. Grants to States The Committee recommendation includes $12,002,848,000 for IDEA Part B Grants to States. This program provides formula grants to assist States, outlying areas, and other entities in meet-ing the costs of providing special education and related services for children with disabilities. States pass along most of these funds to LEAs, but may reserve some for program monitoring, enforcement, technical assistance, and other activities. The appropriation for this program primarily supports activities associated with the 2018-2019 academic year. Of the funds avail-able for this program, $2,719,465,000 will become available on July 1, 2018, and $9,283,383,000 will become available on October 1, 2018. These funds will remain available for obligation through Sep-tember 30, 2019. The Committee recommendation continues bill language con- tinuing several provisions relating to MOE requirements, as re-quested by the administration. Preschool Grants The Committee recommends $368,238,000 for Preschool Grants. This program provides formula grants to States to assist them in making available special education and related services for children with disabilities aged 3 through 5. States distribute the bulk of the funds to LEAs. States must serve all eligible children with disabil-ities aged 3 through 5 and have an approved application under the IDEA. Grants for Infants and Families The Committee recommends $458,556,000 for the Grants for In- fants and Families program under part C of the IDEA. Part C of the IDEA authorizes formula grants to States, outlying areas, and other entities to implement State-wide systems for providing early intervention services to all children with disabilities, ages 2 and younger, and their families. The IDEA also gives States the option of extending eligibility for part C services to children 3 and older if they were previously served under part C and will continue to be served until entrance to kindergarten. State Personnel Development The Committee recommends $38,630,000 for the State Personnel Development program. Ninety percent of funds must be used for professional development activities. The program supports grants to SEAs to help them reform and improve their personnel prepara-tion and professional development related to early intervention, educational, and transition services that improve outcomes for stu-dents with disabilities. The bill includes language proposed in the 176 budget request that allows funds under the program to be used for program evaluation. Technical Assistance and Dissemination The Committee recommends $59,428,000 for Technical Assist- ance and Dissemination. This program supports awards for tech- nical assistance, model demonstration projects, the dissemination of useful information, and other activities. Funding supports activi-ties that are designed to improve the services provided under the IDEA. Within the total, the Committee recommendation includes $15,083,000, an increase of $2,500,000 above the fiscal year 2017 funding level, to support activities authorized by the Special Olym-pics Sport and Empowerment Act, including Project UNIFY. This funding supports efforts to expand Special Olympics programs and the design and implementation of Special Olympics education pro-grams that can be integrated into classroom instruction and are consistent with academic content standards. The Committee strongly encourages the Department to fund a demonstration program, of up to $2,000,000, to test early screening for dyslexia for students in kindergarten and first grade. This could allow for the screening of students in multiple school districts and in multiple states to test for the potential benefits of providing early screening for students, including helping to ensure that stu-dents with dyslexia are identified early and receive the resources and evidence-based interventions needed to help them succeed in school. Personnel Preparation The Committee recommends $83,700,000 for the Personnel Prep- aration program. Funds support competitive awards to help address State-identi- fied needs for personnel who are qualified to work with children with disabilities, including special education teachers and related services personnel. The program is required to fund several other broad areas, including training leadership personnel and personnel who work with children with low-incidence disabilities, and pro-viding enhanced support for beginning special educators. Parent Information Centers The Committee recommends $27,411,000 for Parent Information Centers. This program makes awards to parent organizations to support parent training and information centers, including community par-ent resource centers. These centers provide training and informa-tion to meet the needs of parents of children with disabilities living in the areas served by the centers, particularly underserved par-ents, and parents of children who may be inappropriately identi-fied. Technology and Media Services The Committee recommends $28,047,000 for Technology and Media Services. This program makes competitive awards to sup-177 port the development, demonstration, and use of technology and educational media activities of value to children with disabilities. The Committee continues to recognize the ongoing progress made with the tools and services provided under the Educational Tech-nology, Media and Materials program that have allowed more than 440,000 students with disabilities free access to more than 515,000 books in digitally accessible formats. The Committee strongly en-courages continued effort to expand this program's reach to K-12 students in underserved areas. R EHABILITATION SERVICES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $3,535,589,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 3,563,008,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,562,418,000 Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants The Committee recommends $3,452,931,000 in mandatory fund- ing for Vocational Rehabilitation [VR] State Grants. State Grants assist States in providing a range of services to help persons with physical and mental disabilities prepare for and engage in meaningful employment. The Rehabilitation Act requires that not less than 1 percent and not more than 1.5 percent of the appropriation for VR State Grants be set aside for Grants for American Indians. The Committee recommendation continues bill language allowing the Department to use unobligated VR State grant funds that re-main available subsequent to the reallottment process, to be used for innovative activities to improve outcomes for individuals with disabilities. Client Assistance State Grants The Committee recommends $13,000,000 in discretionary funds for Client Assistance State Grants. This program funds State formula grants to help VR clients or client applicants understand the benefits available to them. States must operate client assistance programs to receive VR State Grant funds. Training The Committee recommends $29,388,000 for training rehabilita- tion personnel. This program supports grants to provide training to new VR staff, or upgrade the qualifications of existing staff. Demonstration and Training Programs The Committee recommendation includes $5,796,000 for dem- onstration and training programs. These programs support activi-ties designed to increase employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities by expanding and improving the availability and provision of rehabilitation and other services. Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights The Committee recommends $17,650,000 for the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights program. 178 This program provides grants to agencies to protect and advocate for the legal and human rights of persons with disabilities who are ineligible for the protection and advocacy services available through the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act or the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act. Supported Employment State Grants The Committee recommendation does not include funding for the Supported Employment State Grants Program. Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind The Committee recommends $33,317,000 for Independent Living State Grants. This program supports assistance to individuals over age 55 to help them adjust to their blindness and continue to live independ-ently, including daily living skills training, counseling, community integration information and referral, the provision of low-vision and communication devices, and low-vision screening. Helen Keller National Center The Committee recommends $10,336,000 for the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youth and Adults. The Helen Keller National Center consists of a national head- quarters in Sands Point, New York, with a residential training and rehabilitation facility where deaf-blind persons receive intensive specialized services; a network of 10 regional field offices that pro-vide referral and counseling assistance to deaf-blind persons; and an affiliate network of agencies. S PECIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR PERSONS WITHDISABILITIES AMERICAN PRINTING HOUSE FOR THE BLIND Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $25,431,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 25,383,000 Committee recommendation The Committee recommends $25,431,000 to help support Amer- ican Printing House for the Blind [APH]. APH provides educational materials to students who are legally blind and enrolled in programs below the college level. The Federal subsidy provides approximately 65 percent of APH's total sales in-come. Materials are distributed free of charge to schools and States through per capita allotments based on the total number of stu-dents who are blind. Materials provided include textbooks and other educational aids in Braille, large type, recorded form, and computer applications. Appropriated funds may be used for staff salaries and expenses, as well as equipment purchases and other acquisitions consistent with the purpose of the Act to Promote the Education of the Blind. The Committee continues to commend APH for the significant progress being made through the Resources with Enhanced Acces-sibility for Learning [REAL] Plan toward developing new tech-nologies to translate educational materials for delivery to students who are blind and visually impaired. The Committee continues to 179 support implementation of the REAL plan, and includes no less than the fiscal year 2017 level for such activities. NATIONAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE FOR THE DEAF Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $70,016,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 69,883,000 Committee recommendation The Committee recommends $70,016,000 for the National Tech- nical Institute for the Deaf [NTID]. NTID, located on the campus of the Rochester Institute of Tech- nology in Rochester, New York, was created by Congress in 1965 to provide a residential facility for postsecondary technical training and education for persons who are deaf. NTID also provides sup-port services for students who are deaf, trains professionals in the field of deafness, and conducts applied research. The Committee strongly supports NTIDs existing partnership with regional institutions, first established with fiscal year 2016 funds, to expand NTID's geographical reach and the availability of services for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing in under-served areas. The Committee believes this partnership has been successful in its first year of implementation. Accordingly, the Committee recommendation includes $2,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2017 level, to continue this partnership, without signifi-cant modifications, in fiscal year 2018. GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $121,275,000 Budget estimate, 2018 University is a private, not-for-profit institution offer- ing undergraduate and continuing education programs for students who are deaf, as well as graduate programs in fields related to deafness for students who are hearing and deaf. The university conducts basic and applied research related to hearing impair-ments and provides public service programs for the deaf commu-nity. This funding also supports the Model Secondary School for the Deaf, which serves as a laboratory for educational experimentation and development; disseminates curricula, materials, and models of instruction for students who are deaf; and prepares adolescents who are deaf for postsecondary academic or vocational education or the workplace. The university's Kendall Demonstration Elementary School develops and provides instruction for children from infancy through age 15. C AREER , TECHNICAL , AND ADULT EDUCATION Appropriations, 2017 estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 1,476,441,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,720,686,000 180 Career and Technical Education The Committee recommends $1,125,019,000 for the Career and Technical Education [CTE] account. State Grants .\u2014The Committee recommends $1,117,598,000 for CTE State grants. Funds provided under the State grant program assist States, lo- calities, and outlying areas to expand and improve their CTE pro-gram and help ensure equal access to CTE for populations with special needs. Persons assisted range from secondary students in prevocational courses through adults who need retraining to adapt to changing technological and labor market conditions. Funds are distributed according to a formula based on State population and State per capita income. Under the Indian and Hawaiian Natives programs, competitive grants are awarded to federally recognized Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations and to organizations primarily serving and rep-resenting Hawaiian Natives for services that are additional to what these groups receive under other provisions of the Perkins Act. Of the funds available for this program, $326,598,000 will be- come available July 1, 2018, and $791,000,000 will become avail-able on October 1, 2018. These funds will remain available for obli-gation until September 30, 2019. National Programs .\u2014The Committee recommends $7,421,000 to support research, development, demonstration, dissemination, eval-uation, and assessment of activities aimed at improving the quality and effectiveness of CTE. Adult Education The Committee recommends $595,667,000 for Adult Education programs. Adult Education State Grants .\u2014The Committee recommendation includes $581,955,000 for Adult Education State Grants, which pro-vides grants to States for programs that assist adults in becoming literate and in obtaining the skills necessary for employment and self-sufficiency. National Leadership Activities .\u2014The Committee recommends $13,712,000 for adult education national leadership activities. S TUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $24,198,210,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 22,932,626,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 24,198,210,000 The Committee recommends an appropriation of $24,198,210,000 for programs under the Student Financial Assistance account. Federal Pell Grant Program The Committee recommends $22,475,352,000 in current year dis- cretionary funding for the Pell grant program. Pell grants provide need-based financial assistance that helps undergraduate students and their families defray a portion of the costs of postsecondary education. Awards are determined according to a statutory need- analysis formula that takes into account a student's family income 181 and assets, household size, and the number of family members, ex- cluding parents, attending postsecondary institutions. The Committee recommendation includes a 1.7 percent increase in the maximum Pell grant award, from $5,920 to $6,020 for the 2018-2019 award year. This is the first discretionary increase in the max award since fiscal year 2007. The Committee rec-ommended funding level for the Pell grant program is also more than sufficient to continue Year-Round Pell [YRP], which was per-manently reinstated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Committee recommendation also includes a rescission of $2,600,000,000 in prior year unobligated balances. In recent years, Congress has consistently appropriated more funding than needed for the Pell grant program, including funding a critical expansion of the program with the reinstatement of YRP in fiscal year 2017. Based on current CBO estimates of program costs, including costs of reinstating YRP last year, and after including the increase in the max award and rescission of unobligated balances included in this bill, there will be approximately $6,000,000,000 in unobligated bal-ances remaining at the end of fiscal year 2018. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program The Committee recommends $733,130,000 for the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant [SEOG] program. The SEOG program provides funds to approximately 3,700 post- secondary institutions for need-based grants to more than 1.5 mil-lion undergraduate students. Institutions must contribute at least 25 percent toward SEOG awards. Students qualify for grants of up to $4,000 by demonstrating financial need. Priority is given to Pell grant recipients with exceptional need. Federal Work-Study Program The Committee bill provides $989,728,000 for the Federal Work- Study [FWS] program. This program provides grants to approximately 3,300 institutions and helps nearly 700,000 undergraduate, graduate, and profes-sional students meet the costs of postsecondary education through part-time employment. Institutions must provide at least 25 per-cent of student earnings. Within the total for FWS, the Committee recommendation in- cludes $8,390,000, the same as the fiscal year 2017 level, for the Work Colleges program authorized under section 448 of the HEA. S TUDENT AIDADMINISTRATION Appropriations, 2017 recommendation ................................................................. 1,576,854,000 The Committee recommends $1,576,854,000 for the Student Aid Administration account. These funds are available until September 30, 2019, and support the Department's student aid management expenses. The Committee recommendation includes $696,643,000 for ad- ministrative costs and $880,211,000 for loan servicing activities. The Committee directs the Department to continue to provide quarterly reports detailing its obligation plan by quarter for stu-182 dent aid administrative activities broken out by servicer and activ- ity. Further, any reallocation of funds between administrative costs and servicing activities within this account should be treated as a reprogramming of funds, and the Committee should be notified in advance of any such changes. Benefits for Servicemembers and Veterans. \u2014The Committee notes that too many veterans and servicemembers eligible for certain stu-dent loan benefits have not taken advantage of these benefits due to a lack of communication between the Departments of Education, Defense, and Veterans Affairs, and Federal student loan servicers. In accordance with section 455(o) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [HEA], eligible military borrowers should not accrue interest on their Federal student loans while serving in an area of hos-tilities. Under the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Stu-dents Act of 2003, servicemembers enrolled in income-driven repay-ment programs are eligible for a waiver from annual recertification obligations of their income. Servicemembers with Federal Perkins Loans are also eligible for a cancellation of a percentage of their debt, based on qualifying years of military service, in accordance with Section 465 of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. Further, many veterans are eligible for a full discharge of their Federal student loan debt due to a service-connected disability under the Total and Permanent Disability Discharge provisions of Section 437 of the HEA. Therefore, the Committee directs the Sec-retary of Education to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs to automate the application of loan benefits to eligible servicemembers and vet-erans using information in existing Federal databases in a timely manner so that servicemembers and veterans can receive the bene-fits due under law. The Committee further directs the Secretary of Education to brief the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the House Committee on Edu-cation and the Workforce on the plan for implementing this auto-mation process within 90 days of enactment of this act. Cohort Default Rates .\u2014The Committee is concerned that some public institutions of higher education operating in economically distressed communities have faced challenges in meeting statutory requirements to manage and prevent student loan defaults because of community-wide factors where the institution operates. The Committee strongly encourages the Secretary to use any authority available, including under section 435(a)(2)(iii) of the HEA, to pro-vide flexibility in applying section 435(a) to institutions of higher education in severely distressed communities in the United States, including institutions operating in counties ranking in the bottom 5 percent of all counties in the Distressed Designation and County Economic Status Classification System of the Appalachian Regional Commission, or based on other commonly used indices or measures. The Committee directs the Secretary to report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on any additional statutory authority the Secretary may need to provide flexibility to such institutions. 183 Electronic Sharing of Tax Data.\u2014 Within the total for the Stu- dent Aid Administration account, the Committee recommendation includes sufficient funding to fully implement the Memorandum of Understanding establishing a framework regarding the require-ments for electronically sharing tax data over multiple years for federal student loan borrowers participating in Income-Driven Re-payment (IDR) plans, as announced by the Departments of Treas-ury and Education on January 17, 2017. Extension of Provisional Institutional Eligibility .\u2014By providing language that extends the time period the Secretary may allow an institution of higher education to remain in provisional status, the Committee is addressing concerns that institutional applications for recognition by another accreditor have not been processed in part due to a lack of staff resources. As such, the extension of this time period does not permit institutions to remain with the same accreditor or relieve the Secretary of her responsibility to ensure that institutions are making timely progress with their applications currently being processed by another accrediting agency. Loan Counseling.\u2014 The Committee notes that Preferred Lender List requirements enacted in 2008 are intended to protect students and families from unfair lending practices in higher education. The implementation of these requirements have affected State-based or-ganizations\u2014including State agencies or authorities, or nonprofit organizations that are authorized, established, or chartered by State statute\u2014in ways that were not intended by Congress. State- based organizations report difficulty in partnering with institutions of higher education to advise students on their individual education financing decisions, including student loan repayment and forgive-ness options, even when such advising is requested by the institu-tion's financial aid administrator. The Committee directs the De-partment within 180 days of enactment to issue guidance to clarify how colleges and universities can allow state-based organizations to participate in advising students on campus without violating Preferred Lender List rules. Pursuant to statutory restrictions, such guidance should not permit institutions of higher education or State-based organizations to directly market or advertise State- based education loan programs to students. Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.\u2014 The Committee notes that there has been significant concern from borrowers over the Department's consistency and reliability in administering the Pub-lic Service Loan Forgiveness [PSLF] program. The Committee en-courages the Department, in coordination with its Federal loan servicers, to update guidance, information, and processes regarding borrower eligibility for PSLF. Further, the Committee encourages the Department to provide further clarity regarding employer eligi-bility under the program, particularly for applicants employed by non-profit organizations that provide certain types of public service, but are not categorized under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Rev-enue Code. This information should be publicly accessible and in-clude real-world examples of organizations that qualify in certain fields. The Committee also notes that there has been concern with the level of service provided to borrowers that intend to seek PSLF. The Committee encourages the Department to provide to borrowers 184 more regular and current information about the status of proc- essing their PSLF employment certification, the number of quali-fying payments made, and the projected date of their forgiveness. Further, the Committee encourages the Department to expand the use of digital technology in the PSLF program, to allow for employ-ment certifications and PSLF applications to be completed elec-tronically, and with each student loan servicer. Finally, to ensure consistency for applicants, the Committee encourages the Depart-ment to revisit decisions to rescind employment certification for borrowers who were previously approved. Student Loan Discharges. \u2014The Committee recognizes that there is ongoing disruption to and burden on the lives of students from the closure of and misconduct by Corinthian Colleges, Inc. [CCi]. Former students who enrolled in many programs of study at more than 100 CCi campuses were provided with highly misleading job placement rate information. At least 45,000 former CCi students have pending applications with the Department for a discharge and refund of their fraudulently issued federal loan debt, and the Com-mittee believes that many more students have not applied. The Committee directs the Secretary to process applications as expedi-tiously as possible, and ensure students are aware of their poten-tial eligibility for relief by identifying and contacting borrowers who may qualify to assert a defense to repayment utilizing the pro-gram-level enrollment information provided to the Department by states in 2016. Student Loan Servicing.\u2014 The Committee recommendation in- cludes new bill language prohibiting the Department from moving forward with a new student loan servicing contract unless the new student loan servicing solution includes the participation of mul-tiple student loan servicers that contract directly with the Depart-ment of Education and allocates student loan borrower accounts to participating servicers based on performance. The Committee strongly believes relying on one servicer will decrease account-ability and add risk to borrowers and taxpayers. Instead, providing for the participation of multiple servicers, utilizing common prac-tices, policies and performance metrics, will promote accountability and incentivize servicers to provide high-quality service to bor-rowers. The Committee expects that each servicer would be respon-sible for managing the full life-cycle of loans, from disbursement to pay-off, with exceptions for common origination and disbursement, specialty servicing for at-risk borrowers, and other unique servicing needs, to ensure competition between servicers. Further, while the Department considers the future of the servicing environment, the Committee encourages the Department to continue pursuing the development of a simple, consistent, and unified experience for all student borrowers through a universal web portal. During the col-laborative information gathering and stakeholder engagement ef-fort related to the new servicing environment that was announced on August 1, 2017, the Department is directed to engage with the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce to gather input from Congress on the design of this envi-ronment. 185 Further, the Committee reiterates the directive included last year and again directs the Department to issue a common policies and procedures manual, including voluntary best practices, to help improve the consistency of servicing for student loan borrowers. The manual should include best practices related to how borrowers should be counseled about repayment options and benefits. The De-partment should utilize expertise and resources from its servicers in developing this manual which can also serve as the guide for servicing standards in the future servicing environment. In addition, the Committee reiterates the directive included in bill language in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, and in-cluded again in this bill, requiring the Department to allow bor-rowers, when consolidating student loans, to select from any of the existing servicers to service their new consolidated loan. The Com-mittee is deeply concerned with how the Department has adhered to congressional directives in this area, including its plan to ignore this directive, as part of their proposal to move to a single-servicer model. H IGHER EDUCATION Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. 2018 ........................................................................... 2,038,126,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,048,439,000 The Committee recommends an appropriation of $2,048,439,000 for higher education programs. Aid for Institutional Development The Committee recommends $577,514,000 in discretionary fund- ing for Aid for Institutional Development. These totals do not in-clude separately authorized and appropriated mandatory funding. Strengthening Institutions .\u2014The Committee bill recommends $86,534,000 to provide competitive, 1-year planning and 5-year de-velopment grants for institutions with a significant percentage of financially needy students and low educational and general ex-penditures per student in comparison with similar institutions. Ap-plicants may use these funds to develop faculty, strengthen aca-demic programs, improve institutional management, and expand student services. Hispanic-Serving Institutions [HSIs] .\u2014The Committee rec- ommends $107,795,000 for competitive grants to institutions at which Hispanic students make up at least 25 percent of enroll-ment.

Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions [HBGIs] .\u2014The Committee recommends $63,281,000 for the Strengthening HBGIs program. This program provides 5-year grants to provide scholarships for low-income students and aca-demic and counseling services to improve student success. Funds may also be used for construction, maintenance, and renovation ac-tivities; the purchase or lease of scientific and laboratory equip-ment; and the establishment of an endowment. Strengthening Predominately Black Institutions [PBIs] .\u2014The Committee recommends $9,942,000 for the Strengthening PBIs pro-gram. This program provides 5-year grants to PBIs to plan and im-plement programs to enhance the institutions' capacity to serve more low- and middle-income Black American students. Strengthening Asian American and Native American Pacific Is- lander-Serving Institutions [AANAPISIs] .\u2014The Committee rec- ommends $3,348,000 for competitive grants to AANAPISIs that have an enrollment of undergraduate students that is at least 10 percent Asian American or Native American Pacific Islander stu-dents.

Overseas Programs .\u2014The Committee recommends $7,061,000 for overseas programs authorized under the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, popularly known as the Fulbright- Hays Act. Funding is provided for group, faculty, or doctoral dis-sertation research abroad as well as special bilateral projects. Grants focus on training American instructors and students to im-prove foreign language and area studies education in the United States. Model Comprehensive Transition and Postsecondary Programs for Students With Intellectual Disabilities The Committee recommendation includes $11,800,000 for com- petitive grants to postsecondary institutions to support model pro-grams that help students with intellectual disabilities transition to and complete college, as authorized by section 767 of the HEA. Funds may be used for student support services; academic enrich-ment, socialization, or independent living; integrated work experi-ences; and partnerships with LEAs to support students with intel-lectual disabilities participating in the model program who are still eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA. Minority Science and Engineering Improvement The Committee recommends $9,648,000 for the Minority Science and Engineering Improvement program. Funds are used to provide discretionary grants to institutions with minority enrollments greater than 50 percent to purchase equipment, develop curricula, and support advanced faculty training. Grants are intended to im-188 prove science and engineering education programs and increase the number of minority students in the fields of science, mathematics, and engineering. Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institu- tions The Committee recommends $8,286,000 for tribally controlled postsecondary vocational institutions. This program provides grants for the operation and improvement of tribally controlled postsecondary vocational institutions to ensure continued and ex-panding opportunities for Indian students. Federal TRIO Programs The Committee recommends $953,000,000 for Federal TRIO pro- grams, which provide a variety of services to improve postsec-ondary education opportunities for low-income individuals and first-generation college students. Upward Bound offers disadvantaged high school students aca- demic services to develop the skills and motivation needed to pur-sue and complete a postsecondary education; Student Support Services provides developmental instruction, counseling, summer programs, and grant aid to disadvantaged college students to help them complete their postsecondary education; Talent Search identi-fies and counsels individuals between ages 11 and 27 regarding op-portunities for completing high school and enrolling in postsec-ondary education; Educational Opportunity Centers provide infor-mation and counseling on available financial and academic assist-ance to low-income adults who are first-generation college students; and the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Pro-gram supports research internships, seminars, tutoring, and other activities to encourage disadvantaged college students to enroll in doctoral programs. The Committee recommendation includes no less than the fiscal year 2017 level for each of the TRIO programs, and rejects the ad-ministration's proposed elimination of the McNair Postbaccalaureate and Educational Opportunity Centers programs. The Committee directs the Secretary to peer review fiscal year 2017 Upward Bound applications that were initially determined in-eligible for further review based on minor technical issues with their grant application. Further, after such review, the Committee directs the Secretary to award funding to any applicants that would have received funding in the fiscal year 2017 grant competi-tion had they been allowed to be reviewed then. The Committee recommendation includes an increase for TRIO to ensure that cur-rent grantees are not adversely impacted by any grant awards that result. The Committee continues to be concerned with the timeliness of the Department's announcement of TRIO grant awards and the im-pact on grantees. The Committee directs the Department conduct a review of all grant award deadlines related to Federal TRIO pro-grams and implement recommendations for upholding these dead-lines, or modifying them to better-align with grantees' program year and to prevent disruption among grantees and the services they provide. 189 The Committee is concerned with the Department's plan to abruptly end certain grants under the Education Opportunity Cen-ters [EOC] program after just one year, and without advance notifi-cation or warning. While the Committee expects grantees to be held to high standards, absent violation of law or regulation, grant-ees should not have their funding terminated mid-grant without significant advance notice and an opportunity to provide corrective actions. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the Committee di-rects the Secretary to ensure that grantees are notified at least 90 in advance that they are in danger of not having their grant contin-ued unless they take specific corrective actions. Further, the Com-mittee directs the Secretary to provide particular flexibility to new grantees, grantees operating in particularly underserved areas, and grantees facing other extenuating circumstances. Accordingly, the Department shall provide continuation grants to EOC programs ac-cording to their initial grant awards. Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Pro- grams The Committee recommends $339,754,000 for GEAR UP, which provides grants to States and partnerships of colleges, middle and high schools, and community organizations to assist cohorts or stu-dents in middle and high schools serving a high percentage of low- income students. Services provided help students prepare for and pursue a postsecondary education. The Committee directs the Secretary to announce in the Federal Register a Notice for Application for New Awards for State grants for this fiscal year and establish a maximum award for such awards that accommodates the larger grants made to States under previous grant competitions. The Department is strongly encour-aged to publish the notice inviting applications as soon as possible. The Committee believes that the rejection of the budget's proposed cut to GEAR UP enables the Department to prevent State grantees that received higher annual grant amounts based on prior competi-tion maximum award amounts from reducing services as a result of a potential lower maximum award for a State grant competition in 2018. The Committee continues bill language allowing the Department to set aside up to 1.5 percent of the total provided for evaluation purposes. Further, the Committee directs the Department to work with the GEAR UP community and grantees to standardize data collection, including through the use of third-party data systems. Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need and Javits Fellow- ships The Committee recommends $23,047,000 to support the Grad- uate Assistance in Areas of National Need [GAANN] program. GAANN supports fellowships through 3-year competitive grants to graduate academic departments and programs in scientific and technical fields and other areas of national need as determined by the Secretary. Fellowship recipients must have excellent academic records and high financial need and must be pursuing doctoral de-grees or the highest graduate degrees in their academic field. Each fellowship consists of a student stipend to cover living costs and an 190 institutional payment to cover each fellow's tuition and other ex- penses. Institutions of higher education must match 25 percent of the grant amount. Teacher Quality Partnership Program The Committee recommends $38,092,000 for the Teacher Quality Partnership [TQP] program. The TQP program helps improve the quality of teachers working in high-need schools and early child-hood education programs by creating model teacher preparation and residency programs. Child Care Access Means Parents in Schools The Committee recommendation includes $15,134,000 for the Child Care Access Means Parents in Schools program. This pro-gram provides competitive grants to institutions of higher edu-cation to establish or support campus-based child care programs, to help support needs and participation of low-income parents in post- secondary education. H OWARD UNIVERSITY Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 221,399,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 221,821,000 The Committee recommends an appropriation of $221,821,000 for Howard University. Located in the District of Columbia, Howard offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees through 12 schools and colleges. The university also administers the How-ard University Hospital. Federal funds from this account support approximately 38 percent of the university's operating costs. The Committee recommends, within the funds provided, not less than $3,405,000 for the endowment program. Howard University Hospital .\u2014Within the funds provided, the Committee recommends $27,325,000 for Howard University Hos-pital. The hospital provides inpatient and outpatient care, as well as training in the health professions. It also serves as a major acute and ambulatory care center for the District of Columbia and functions as a major teaching facility attached to the university. The Federal appropriation provides partial funding for the hos-pital's operations. C OLLEGE HOUSING AND ACADEMIC FACILITIES LOANS PROGRAM Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $435,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 434,000 Committee 435,000 Federal Administration .\u2014The Committee bill includes $435,000 for Federal administration of the CHAFL, College Housing Loans, and Higher Education Facilities Loans programs. Prior to fiscal year 1994, these programs provided financing for the construction, reconstruction, and renovation of housing, academic, and other edu-cational facilities. While no new loans have been awarded since fis-cal year 1993, costs for administering the outstanding loans will continue through 2030. These funds will be used to reimburse the 191 Department for administrative expenses incurred in managing the existing loan portfolio. HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAPITAL FINANCING PROGRAM ACCOUNT Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $20,484,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 20,445,000 Committee 20,484,000 The Committee recommends $20,484,000 for the HBCU Capital Financing Program. The Committee recommendation includes $20,150,000 to pay the loan subsidy costs in guaranteed loan authority under this pro-gram. This amount will support an estimated $314,000,000 in new loan volume in fiscal year 2018. The remaining $334,000 will be used for administrative expenses. The HBCU Capital Financing Program makes capital available to HBCUs for construction, renovation, and repair of academic fa-cilities by providing a Federal guarantee for private sector con-struction bonds. Construction loans will be made from the proceeds of the sale of the bonds. I NSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $605,267,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 616,839,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 600,267,000 The Committee recommends $600,267,000 for the Institute of Education Sciences [IES]. This account supports education re-search, development, dissemination, and evaluation; data collection and analysis activities; and the assessment of student progress. Under the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002, Congress es- tablished IES to provide objective and valid research-driven knowl-edge that was free of political influence or bias so as to better in-form effective education practices at the State and local levels. The act required IES, in carrying out its mission, ''to compile statistics, develop products, and conduct research, evaluations, and wide dis-semination activities in areas of demonstrated national need and ensure that such activities conform to high standards of quality, in-tegrity, and accuracy and are objective, secular, neutral, and non-ideological and are free of partisan political influence.'' The Committee directs the Director to submit an operating plan within 90 days of enactment of this act to the Committees on Ap-propriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate detail-ing how IES plans to allocate funding available to the Institute for research, evaluation, and other activities authorized under law. The Committee supports IES's plans in fiscal year 2018 to select a National Research and Development Center on Improving Rural Education. The Committee understands that this center will build the capacity of rural schools to use high-quality, scientific research to improve student outcomes, as envisioned by ESSA. The Com-mittee is particularly interested in research that addresses the spe-cific needs of diverse rural schools. The Committee strongly encour-ages IES to establish a research and development center specifi-cally designed for research collaboration between university experts 192 and underperforming LEAs in rural districts that serve high pov- erty and minority students with high dropout rates. Further, the research center should address the needs of rural schools in rela-tion to early childhood education, teacher education, school needs assessment, and transition to post-secondary education. Priority should be given to applicants who create a network of partnerships that touch various geographic regions of the Nation. To address concerns about the privacy of student data, particu- larly personally identifiable information, the Committee continues to direct the Department to ensure that its employees, contractors, and grantees, including States that receive funds from Statewide Longitudinal Data System grants, adhere to the strictest and high-est standards for protecting personally identifiable information. The Committee notes the Department is planning, pursuant to Senate Committee Report 114-274, to report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-mittee and the House Education and the Workforce Committee, on the actions it has taken to comply with this directive. RESEARCH , DEVELOPMENT , AND DISSEMINATION The Committee recommends $185,000,000 for education research, development, and national dissemination activities. Funds are available for obligation for 2 fiscal years. These funds support ac-tivities that are aimed at expanding fundamental knowledge of education and promoting the use of research and development find-ings in the design of efforts to improve education. STATISTICS The Committee recommends $107,000,000 for data gathering and statistical analysis activities at the National Center for Education Statistics [NCES]. NCES collects, analyzes, and reports statistics on education in the United States. Activities are carried out directly and through grants and contracts. The Center collects data on educational insti-tutions at all levels, longitudinal data on student progress, and data relevant to public policy. NCES also provides technical assist-ance to SEAs, LEAs, and postsecondary institutions. REGIONAL EDUCATIONAL LABORATORIES The Committee recommends $54,423,000 to continue support for the Regional Educational Laboratories program. Funds available in this bill will continue to support a network of 10 laboratories. The laboratories are responsible for promoting the use and development of knowledge and evidence in broad-based systemic strategies to in-crease student learning and further school improvement efforts. The Committee appreciates the efforts of IES to strengthen the connections between practitioners and the research community, so that federally supported research is timely, relevant, and respon-sive to the needs of the field. 193 RESEARCH AND INNOVATION IN SPECIAL EDUCATION The Committee recommends $54,000,000 for research and inno- vation in special education conducted by the National Center for Special Education Research. The Center addresses gaps in scientific knowledge to improve special education and early intervention services and outcomes for infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities. Funds provided to the Center are available for obligation for 2 fiscal years. SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDIES AND EVALUATIONS The Committee recommends $10,818,000 for special education studies and evaluations. This program supports competitive grants, contracts, and cooper- ative agreements to assess the implementation of IDEA. Funds are also used to evaluate the effectiveness of State and local efforts to deliver special education services and early intervention programs. Funds are available for obligation for 2 fiscal years. STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEMS The Committee recommendation includes $32,281,000 for the Statewide Data Systems program. This program supports competitive grants to SEAs to enable such agencies to design, develop, and implement Statewide, longi- tudinal data systems to manage, analyze, disaggregate, and use in-dividual data for students of all ages. Early childhood, postsec-ondary, and workforce information systems may be linked to such systems or developed with program funds. The Committee believes the Department should continue its efforts to ensure every State has the base support necessary to develop effective systems. Funds are available for obligation for 2 fiscal years. ASSESSMENT The Committee recommends $156,745,000 to provide support for the National Assessment of Educational Progress [NAEP], a con-gressionally mandated assessment created to measure and report the educational achievement of American students in a range of subjects and analyze trends over time. Within the funds appropriated, the Committee recommends $7,745,000 for the National Assessment Governing Board [NAGB], which is responsible for formulating policy for NAEP. The Committee continues to support assessments for students in United States History, Civics, and Geography. The Committee di-rects NAGB to continue administering assessments in these three areas, at least every four years, in accordance with the current NAEP schedule. According to this schedule, the next administra-tion will be in 2018 for 8th grade students. D EPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $432,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 438,000,000 Committee recommendation 194 The Committee recommends $430,000,000 for program adminis- tration. Funds support personnel compensation and benefits, travel, rent, communications, utilities, printing, equipment and supplies, auto-mated data processing, and other services required to award, ad-minister, and monitor Federal education programs. Support for program evaluation and studies and advisory councils is also pro-vided under this account. Borrower Defense Claims Reporting .\u2014The Committee directs the Department to report on a quarterly basis to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representative and the Senate, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, on the re-ceipt and processing by the Department of borrower defense claims made pursuant to section 455(h) of the HEA. This should include information on the total number of pending borrower defense claims, total number of approved borrower defense claims, total dollar amount of relief, and total number of denied claims, includ-ing disaggregated by State. The report shall also include specific actions taken and planned to process this workload in a timely manner. The Committee strongly encourages the Department to make the reports publicly available on its website. Performance Partnerships .\u2014The Committee recommendation continues authority for Performance Partnerships as included in prior appropriations acts. Performance Partnerships allow States and localities to demonstrate better ways of improving outcomes for disconnected youth by giving them additional flexibility in using discretionary funds across multiple Federal programs. The Com-mittee also continues to encourage the administration to enhance its efforts working with existing and potential sites on the full range of flexibilities that could be employed to help better serve disconnected youth. Finally, the Committee is interested in expand-ing Performance Partnerships to other populations and programs, and has requested reports from GAO to help explore this possi-bility. Pooled Evaluation Authority .\u2014The Committee requests that the Department provide a report to the Committee on the planned use of pooled evaluation funds under section 8601 of the ESEA, con-sistent with the required plan under such section, not later than 15 days prior to any transfer of funds. Competitive Grant Priorities for Rural Areas.\u2014 The Committee continues to encourage the Department to continue efforts to en-sure that competitive grants are reaching rural areas and States so that support and solutions developed with Federal funding are relevant to and available in such areas. OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $108,500,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 106,797,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 117,000,000 The Committee recommends $117,000,000 for the Office of Civil Rights [OCR]. OCR is responsible for the enforcement of laws that prohibit dis- crimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, dis-195 ability, and age in all programs and institutions that receive finan- cial assistance from the Department. To carry out this responsi-bility, OCR investigates and resolves discrimination complaints, monitors desegregation and equal educational opportunity plans, reviews possible discriminatory practices by recipients of Federal education funds, and provides technical assistance to recipients of funds to help them meet these civil rights requirements. In reviewing, investigating, or deciding whether there has been a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, on the basis of race, color, or national origin, based on an individual's actual or perceived shared Jewish ancestry or Jewish ethnic characteristics, the Committee strongly encourages OCR to take into consideration the definition and examples of anti-Semitism set forth by the State Department's Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism when assessing whether a practice was motivated by anti-Semitic intent. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $59,256,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 61,143,000 The Committee recommends $59,256,000 for OIG. OIG has the authority to investigate all departmental programs and administrative activities, including those under contract or grant, to prevent and detect fraud and abuse, and to ensure the quality and integrity of those programs. The Office investigates al-leged misuse of Federal funds and conducts audits to determine compliance with laws and regulations, efficiency of operations, and effectiveness in achieving program goals.

(197) TITLE IV RELATED AGENCIES COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE FROM PEOPLE WHOAREBLIND OR SEVERELY DISABLED SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $8,000,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 6,117,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,000,000 The Committee recommends $8,000,000 for the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, of which no less than $1,250,000 shall be made available for the Of-fice of Inspector General. The AbilityOne program provides more than 46,000 blind or se- verely disabled Americans with employment opportunities each year. The primary purpose of this program is to increase the em-ployment opportunities for people who are blind or have other se-vere disabilities and, whenever possible, to prepare them to engage in competitive employment. Encompassing approximately $3,300,000,000 in contracts, it is the Federal Government's largest employment program for the severely disabled. The Committee is encouraged by the steps the Commission has taken to implement the recommendations outlined in the May 2013 GAO report ad-dressing the concerns regarding the oversight of the Central Non-profit Agencies, the independent contracted organizations which administer the program. The Committee directs the Commission to provide an update on these efforts to the Committees on Appropria-tions of the House of Representatives and the Senate within 120 days of enactment of this act. C ORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE The Corporation for National and Community Service [CNCS], a corporation owned by the Federal Government, was established to enhance opportunities for national and community service. CNCS administers programs authorized under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act, the National and Community Service Trust Act, and the SERVE America Act. Grants are awarded to States, public and private nonprofit organizations, and other entities to create service opportunities for students, out-of-school youth, adults, and seniors. The Committee recommendation for CNCS provides a total pro- gram level of $1,018,916,000. OPERATING EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $736,029,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 31,689,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 736,429,000 198 The Committee recommends $736,429,000 for the operating ex- penses of CNCS. Volunteers in Service to America [VISTA] The Committee recommends $92,364,000 for VISTA. This pro- gram provides capacity building for small, community-based orga-nizations with a mission of combating poverty. VISTA members raise resources, recruit and organize volunteers, and establish and expand programs in housing, employment, health, and economic development activities. National Senior Volunteer Corps The Committee recommends $202,117,000 for the National Sen- ior Volunteer Corps programs, a collection of programs that connect Americans older than the age of 55 with opportunities to contribute their job skills and expertise to community projects and organiza-tions. These programs include the Retired Senior Volunteer Pro-gram [RSVP], the Foster Grandparent Program, and the Senior Companion Program. AmeriCorps State and National Grants The Committee recommends $386,010,000 for AmeriCorps State and National Grants, which provide funds to local and national or-ganizations and agencies to address community needs in education, public safety, health, and the environment. Each of these organiza-tions and agencies, in turn, uses its AmeriCorps funding to recruit, place, and supervise AmeriCorps members. AmeriCorps members receive a modest living allowance and other benefits proportional to their level of time commitment. The Committee strongly supports CNCS' efforts and initiatives in several areas, including but not limited to, supporting activities in communities experiencing civil unrest and significant violence, in-cluding strengthening relationships between communities and law enforcement; helping address the opioid epidemic; and responding to natural disasters. AmeriCorps programs are uniquely situated to respond to such crises that impact communities across the country and the Committee strongly encourages CNCS to expand on these efforts. Commission Investment Fund [CIF].\u2014 The Committee rec- ommendation includes no less than $7,500,000, the same as the fis-cal year 2017 level for CIF, which provides funds to State commis-sions for training and technical assistance activities to expand the capacity of current and potential AmeriCorps programs, particu-larly in underserved areas. Fixed Amount Grants.\u2014 The Committee encourages CNCS to ex- pand opportunities for AmeriCorps programs to utilize fixed amount grants, which could reduce unnecessary administrative burdens on current and potential AmeriCorps programs. The Com-mittee encourages CNCS to increase the current maximum cost per member service year of fixed amount grants to make it more com-parable to cost reimbursement grant levels and allow new AmeriCorps programs to be eligible to apply for full-time fixed amount grants, while also ensuring that fixed amount grantees 199 provide a comparable amount of matching funds and that there is sufficient oversight and accountability of fixed amount grantees. Professional Corps.\u2014 The Committee continues to direct CNCS to include a determination of need by the local community among the factors that a professional corps program may use to demonstrate an inadequate number of professional in a community. Further, the Committee strongly encourages CNCS to increase the maximum amount of operating funds per member service year a professional corps program may request as part of their grant application. The Committee continues to direct CNCS to provide professional corps programs flexibility in justifying the need for operating funds to en-sure that these programs are able to provide high-quality services in all communities. Reduced Full-Time Service Position.\u2014 The Committee includes a new general provision to allow CNCS to establish a new 1,200 hour service position, including a proportional reduction in the education award. This will provide AmeriCorps programs increased flexi-bility, and more closely align member service positions with the needs of local communities.

C ORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING Appropriations, 2019 ............................................................................. $445,000,000 Budget estimate, 2020 ........................................................................... ........................... Committee recommendation, 2020 ....................................................... 445,000,000 The Committee recommends $445,000,000 for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting [CPB] as an advance appropriation for fiscal year 2020. The majority of these funds go directly to local public television and radio stations to support their programming. CPB funds also 201 support the creation of content for radio, television, and other plat- forms; system support activities that benefit the entire public broadcasting community; and CPB's administrative costs. The Committee recommendation includes an additional $20,000,000 in fiscal year 2018 for the replacement and upgrade of the public broadcasting interconnection system. The Committee supports the Corporation's move to an annual interconnection appropriation from a periodic lump sum request. Since fiscal year 1991, Congress has provided the Corporation with a separate appropriation for interconnection, recognizing its essen-tial role in providing every American the quality and quantity of public media services, including educational, informational and cul-tural content of national, regional and local interest. Technology and distribution systems have greatly evolved since Congress established the practice of funding public broadcasting interconnection. Recognizing technology's power in creating further cost efficiencies across the public media system, the Committee supports CPB in replacing and upgrading the public broadcasting interconnection system and further investing in systemwide infra-structure and services that benefit the American people.

This amount includes an estimated $1,000,000 derived from income taxes on vested dual benefits. This appropria-tion provides for vested dual benefit payments to beneficiaries cov-ered under both the railroad retirement and Social Security sys-tems. FEDERAL PAYMENTS TO THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $150,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 150,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 150,000 The Committee recommends $150,000 for Federal Payments to the Railroad Retirement Account.

S OCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION PAYMENTS TO SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUNDS Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $11,400,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 11,400,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 11,400,000 The Committee recommends $11,400,000 in mandatory funds for payments to Social Security trust funds. This account reimburses the Old Age and Survivors Insurance [OASI] and Disability Insur-ance [DI] trust funds for special payments to certain uninsured persons, costs incurred administering pension reform activities, and the value of the interest for benefit checks issued but not nego-tiated. This appropriation restores the trust funds to the same fi-nancial position they would have been in had they not borne these costs and they were properly charged to general revenues. SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME PROGRAM Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $43,618,163,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 38,556,526,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 38,450,927,000 The Committee recommends $38,450,927,000 in fiscal year 2018 mandatory funds for the SSI program. This is in addition to the $15,000,000,000 provided in the fiscal year 2017 appropriations act for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. In addition, the Committee recommends $19,500,000,000 in advance funding for the first quar-ter of fiscal year 2019. The SSI program guarantees a minimum level of income to individuals who are disabled, blind, or older than age 65, and meet certain income and resource limitations. Federal Benefit Payments The Committee recommendation includes a fiscal year 2018 pro- gram level of $48,236,000,000 for Federal benefit payments. This will support an average monthly benefit of approximately $569 for 8,100,000 recipients. Beneficiary Services The Committee recommendation includes $159,000,000 in new mandatory budget authority for beneficiary services. These funds reimburse vocational rehabilitation [VR] agencies for successfully rehabilitating disabled SSI recipients by helping them achieve and sustain productive, self-supporting work activity. Funds also support the Ticket to Work program that provides SSI recipients with a ticket to offer employment networks [ENs], in-cluding VR agencies, in exchange for employment and support serv-206 ices. Instead of reimbursing ENs for specific services, the Ticket to Work program pays ENs based on recipients achieving certain milestones and outcomes. Research and Demonstration The Committee recommendation includes $101,000,000 in man- datory funds for research and demonstration projects conducted under sections 1110, 1115, and 1144 of the Social Security Act. These funds support a variety of research and demonstration projects designed to improve the disability process, promote self- sufficiency and assist individuals in returning to work, encourage savings and retirement planning through financial literacy, and generally provide analytical and data resources for use in pre-paring and reviewing policy proposals. Administrative Expenses The Committee recommendation includes $4,954,927,000 for SSI program administrative expenses. This appropriation funds the SSI program's share of administrative expenses incurred through the Limitation on Administrative Expenses [LAE] account. LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $12,480,945,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 12,453,000,000 Committee recommendation ................................................................. 11,988,945,000 Due to budget constraints, the Committee recommends $11,988,945,000 for SSA's LAE account. This account provides re-sources for SSA to administer the OASI, DI, and SSI programs, and to support CMS in administering the Medicare program. The LAE account is funded by the Social Security and Medicare trust funds for their share of administrative expenses, the general fund for the SSI program's share of administrative expenses, and appli-cable user fees. These funds support core administrative activities including processing retirement and disability claims, conducting hearings to review disability determination appeals, issuing Social Security numbers and cards, processing individuals' annual earn-ings information, and ensuring the integrity of Social Security pro-grams through continuing disability reviews [CDR] and SSI rede-terminations of non-medical eligibility. The Committee recommendation includes $1,735,000,000 for pro- gram integrity activities, including CDRs and SSI redeterminations of non-medical eligibility. This includes $273,000,000 in base fund-ing and $1,462,000,000 in cap adjustment funding allowed under the Budget Control Act [BCA]. The Committee recommendation is a $84,000,000 decrease from the fiscal year 2017 funding level, as specified in the BCA. Combined, these activities are estimated to save approximately $9,828,000,000 over 10 years for the Social Se-curity, Medicare, and Medicaid programs by preventing waste, fraud, abuse, and improper payments. The Committee is supportive of efforts to reduce improper pay- ments and improve program integrity in the SSA's disability and Supplemental Security Income benefits programs. As part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Congress empowered SSA to enter into an information exchange with a payroll data provider to pre-207 vent improper payments of such benefits. These programs have proven to be beneficial in reducing improper payments for other Federal and State benefits programs, and the Committee urges SSA to prioritize the utilization of these opportunities. Within the funds provided to SSA for continuing disability re- views under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act and con-ducting redeterminations of eligibility, the Committee encourages SSA to utilize all of the tools available to it from commercial and non-commercial entities that collect and maintain data regarding employment and wages, to ensure that disability and SSI benefits are properly paid and to reduce fraud and abuse. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 CJ on the progress that SSA has made in utilizing additional tools to identify improper payments, as well as progress it has made in those efforts. Disability Insurance .\u2014The Committee recognizes that the pur- pose of the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program [Ticket Program] is to provide the assistance disabled beneficiaries need to return to work. The Committee is aware that the SSA OIG found that employment impacts may have been similar for beneficiaries, whether they had participated in the Ticket Program or other em-ployment assistance programs. The Committee directs SSA to sub-mit a report no later than 90 days after the enactment of this act determining if the Ticket Program is having the desired measur-able results and if it is or is not cost effective to continue the Ticket Program. Medical Vocational Guidelines .\u2014The Committee is dedicated to ensuring that the disabled have access to needed benefits, and strongly encourages SSA to work with us to achieve that goal. The Committee continues to be concerned that SSA uses outdated rules to determine whether or not a claimant meets SSA's definition of disability. The Committee is encouraged by SSA's indication that they are beginning the regulatory process, having already received input from the National Disability Forum, the National Institute of Medicine, as well as various aging and employment experts. These initial steps are well received, as Congress continues to work with the Administration to modernize the outdated vocational guidelines into a structure that reflects the 21st century labor market. How-ever, SSA officials have indicated to GAO that the complete update of the occupational grid is not expected to be completed until 2024, and at a cost of $178,000,000. As this is the first significant over-haul of the grid in nearly 40 years, the Committee requests SSA to submit, no later than 60 days after the enactment of this act, a report on its ongoing efforts to update the grid, including the lat-est status of the Occupational Information System joint project with the Department of Labor. In addition, the report shall include a study assessing the feasibility of maintaining a continuous up-date of the medical vocational guidelines every 10 years. In con-junction with the agency's release of findings, the Committee di-rects SSA, in coordination with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, to brief the Committee on the status and progress of the ongoing update to the Medical Vocational Guidelines no later than 90 days after the enactment of this act. Reducing the Hearing Backlog .\u2014The Committee is aware of the discord between SSA and the ALJ community regarding the imple-208 mentation of part of SSA's Compassionate and Responsive Service [CARES] plan to reduce the significant hearing backlog at the agency. Specifically, there is concern regarding the Administra-tion's hiring of Administrative Appeals Judges for non-disability and remanded cases. The Committee recognizes the need for fur-ther discussion regarding this matter and encourages SSA to en-gage with the ALJ community and appropriate stakeholders to find innovative solutions to address hearing wait times, keeping in mind the goal of reducing the backlog to serve the over 1,100,000 individuals and their families awaiting a hearing decision. Social Security Advisory Board .\u2014The Committee recommenda- tion includes not less than $2,300,000 for the Social Security Advi-sory Board. This board advises the Commissioner of Social Security and makes recommendations to Congress and the President on policies relating to the OASI, DI, and SSI programs. User Fees .\u2014Within the total for LAE, the Committee rec- ommendation includes up to $119,000,000 for administrative activi-ties funded from user fees. This includes $118,000,000 in fees col-lected from States that request SSA to administer State SSI sup-plementary payments and up to $1,000,000 from fees collected from non-attorney claimant representatives. Work Incentives Planning and Assistance [WIPA] and Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security [PABSS] .\u2014The Committee recommendation includes $23,000,000 for WIPA and $7,000,000 for PABSS, the same as the comparable fiscal year 2017 levels, respectively. These programs provide valuable services to help Social Security disability beneficiaries return to work. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL Appropriations, 2017 ............................................................................. $105,500,000 Budget estimate, 2018 ........................................................................... 105,500,000 Committee recommends $105,500,000 SSA's OIG. This includes $75,500,000 funded from the OASI and DI trust funds for those programs' share of OIG's expenses and $30,000,000 funded from general revenues for the SSI program's share of expenses.
