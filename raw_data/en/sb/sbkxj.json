The dietitian and physician ask every patient about any supplements or herbals he or she uses during the initial evaluation. Our health care team recommends stopping use of all such preparations at this initial evaluation. These preparations may affect treatment or even cause a serious infection. There are four areas of concern about the use of nutritional supplements, herbals and other preparations during marrow or stem cell transplantation or high dose chemotherapy: 1. Interactions between preparations and prescribed medications may reduce the effectiveness of drugs routinely used during the course of transplantation or chemotherapy. 2. Potential contamination of preparations derived from plants may cause bacterial, fungal or parasitic infections due to inadequate purification and sterilization. Even boiling water may not destroy some infectious organisms that can contaminate these products. 3. A few specific preparations have been repeatedly associated with serious toxic side effects to the liver, blood, kidneys, heart and other body organs. 4. The production, distribution, and labeling of herbal preparations and nutrient supplements are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As a result, the dosage may vary from the dose listed on the label. Also, the product might contain ingredients not listed on the label. Herbal and Botanical Preparations Herbal and botanical preparations include a variety of products derived directly from plants. They may be sold as tablets, capsules, liquid extracts, teas, powders and topical preparations. There are no manufacturing regulations for the cleanliness or purity of these products. Therefore, there is a danger the products may be contaminated with fungus, bacteria, parasites or other chemicals, which can be life-threatening to a person with an impaired immune system, including persons receiving chemotherapy or transplantation. Even boiling water may not kill some organisms which can contaminate these products. The health care team recommends that all herbal and botanical products be avoided during chemotherapy and as long as the immune system is impaired. The decision to use any preparation should be discussed with your physician, who will consider the effects of the product on your kidneys, liver and other organs, as well as your risk of infection and any interactions it may have with other medications. Some herbals may decrease blood clotting. Persons with low platelet counts should not take garlic and gingko bilboa. The following list includes herbal and botanical medications with known dangerous side effects and should not be taken under any circumstance . Other herbs and botanicals could be found to be dangerous in the future. Always talk with your physician before taking herbal and botanical preparations. Alfalfa Kava Kava or Valerian /Gd8/G20Do not use any product that is given as an injection into the central line or as an injection under the skin. Vitamin and Mineral Supplements and Antioxidants Patients are prescribed a multiple vitamin and mineral supplement that provides nutrients at levels approximately those of the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). In some instances, patients may wish to take higher doses of specific vitamins, minerals, or antioxidants. While higher doses are not suggested, the following is a list outlining the DRI and maximum amounts of supplements recommended. Higher doses may be toxic or interact with other medications.

However, taking antioxidant supplements during radiation and chemotherapy may reduce the effectiveness of these treatments in destroying diseased cells. Therefore, patients should stop antioxidant supplementation prior to chemotherapy and radiation. Antioxidants may be inappropriate posttransplant due to interactions with medications, immunosuppressive therapy or other vitamins and minerals in your body. Your dietitian can provide you with more information. Patients considering taking antioxidants posttransplant should discuss this with their physician. water-soluble nutrients that assist in energy production. High levels of supplementation may not be toxic. However, it is important to maintain a balance among these B-vitamins. High doses of one may have a negative effect. Specific Recommendations As your immune system begins to recover and strengthen, you may be able to include herbal supplements and vitamins in your diet, dependent on the type of transplant you have had. Some people wish to start using the supplements they were taking prior to transplant. It is critical to check with your health care team prior to taking any vitamin or herbal supplement, as some may put your still immature immune system at risk. Allogeneic Transplantation Patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation (from an unrelated or family donor) are at risk for infections until all immunosuppressive medications have been stopped and the patient is free of active chronic GVHD (graft versus host disease). Immunosuppressive herbals or botanicals must be discussed with the attending and infectious disease physicians. If vitamin and mineral supplementation above the Dietary Reference Intake is desired, consult with both your physician and dietitian. Autologous Transplantation Even beyond the neutropenic period, patients undergoing autologous transplantation may be at risk for infection. Herbals and botanicals should be avoided until patients have no active gastrointestinal (\"GI\") problems and have been off prednisone therapy for one month. Use of herbals or botanicals after that time should be discussed with your physician, and under the direction of a licensed naturopathic physician. Vitamin and mineral supplementation above the DRI should be discussed with your physician and dietitian. Chemotherapy Patients undergoing chemotherapy for stem cell mobilization or tumor debulking should follow the recommendations for autologous transplantation. "}
