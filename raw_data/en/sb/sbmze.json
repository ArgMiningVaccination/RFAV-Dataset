I have received close to 30 messages from some very helpful individuals. After consolidating all the data, it turns out that there are three main sources of information on alternative medicine: 1) ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (AMED) This is a database searchable on DATASTAR that ayurvedic and Chinese medicine; herbal, light, water, heat and diet therapy. It lists articles from approximately 350 journal titles, as well as newspaper articles and books, from 1985 to the present. The database is updated monthly and contains some 50,000 records. DATASTAR can be reached at any of the following numbers: 1-800-221-7754 1-215-687-6777 1-415-988-9550 There is a printed version of this database, on which there seems to be little agreement as to the authoritative title. Some of the INTERNET messages refer to it as Alternative Therapy Index, others as Alternative Medicine Index, and a third group calls it Complementary Medicine Index. In any case, it is produced by the Medical Information Service, British Library, Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, ENGLAND, LS23 7BQ. The annual subscription is 75 pounds. You can reach them at 44937 546039 (tel) or 44937 546236 (fax). 2) CHIROLARS is a database available on BRS which deals with chiropractic medicine, physical therapy, acupuncture and biofeedback. The printed version is called Index to Chiropractic Literature. 3) There is an INTERNET discussion list called HOLISTIC which seems interesting. To subscribe, enter [[log in to unmask]]after the \"to\" prompt. Leave the \"subject\" prompt blank. Enter the following as your message : subscribe holistic followed by your name. To send messages to the discussion list, enter [[log in to unmask]]Finally, the following is supposedly a good article on searching the alternative medicine literature (haven't seen it yet myself): Van Camp, AJ. Online sources for alternative medicine information. Database 16(5) Oct 1993: 100-3. Hope this is of some help to you.
