We are extremely grateful to Dr Jennifer Lee, Adjunct Associate Professor Lee Chien Earn, Dr Chong Yoke Sin, Professor Alastair Campbell and Professor Walter Tan for their dedicated service after having served on the Board for six and more years. They have worked closely with HSA's leadership to strengthen the organisation's capability as a trusted regulator and scientific authority, and have given much wise guidance to develop HSA's strategic direction and areas of priority that have enabled the organisation to attain its current status. We extend our warmest welcome to Mr Max Loh, Mrs Tan Li Lian, Mr Adam Abdur Rahman and Mr Tai Lee Siang as our new Board members. We look forward to their fresh perspectives and strong work experience from the private sector. With their experience in audit, communications, risk management and infrastructure development, the new Board members will help to ensure continued good governance while HSA continues to advance. The Board will also work with Senior Management to focus the organisation on critical systems, development, and strategies to better future proof HSA in an increasingly challenging environment. I am grateful for a Board and Senior Management team with such a collective sense of purpose ensuring that HSA fulfils its fundamental mission to protect and advance Singapore's national health and safety.The Board of Directors has been renewed. What are your thoughts about the role of the Board as HSA continues to develop? Q HSA has done well in its first twelve years, but it will always need to keep up with the increasingly rapid pace of science and technology. We must always ensure that we can run a transfusion medicine service and apply analytical and regulatory science that are at the forefront of current knowledge to the benefit of Singapore. The expertise and standing of our staff will always be the critical factor. Our scientists, health professionals and administrators must continue to be of the highest calibre and integrity, and share our vision to build an organisation that serves our national needs and is well respected internationally. Our priority must be to create an environment and culture that can effectively attract, retain, and develop our people through relevant training, good mentoring and robust succession planning.How can HSA continue to build on the strong foundation it has established? Q We must continue strengthening and expanding our partnerships with local academic institutions and our counterpart agencies globally. We have to collaborate with them, learn from them, and leverage on their strengths to optimise our small talent base. We always have to be sensitive to the scientific and social environment in which we function. These include the impact of an aging population on the demand for safe and sustainable blood products, the implications of our globally interconnected world on the regulation of health products across international supply chains, and developing enhanced capabilities in forensic and analytical testing to support the administration of justice. It is important that we proactively upgrade and renew our infrastructure to enable the organisation to meet current as well as future needs. This includes systems, processes, equipment and physical space so that our staff are able to carry out their work in an optimal setting and with the relevant means to do their jobs well.HSA Annual Report 2012/1307HSA Annual Report 2012/1308To better meet today's challenges, we are focused on capability building across our professional groups. During the year, we made significant progress in expanding our core capabilities, and increasing customer engagement and service quality. To better meet today's challenges, we are focused on capability building across our professional groups. These include new testing services for food safety and new testing methodologies for drug abuse using hair samples to support enforcement agencies. We have also introduced new buffy-coat method of platelet preparation to provide hospitals with better quality platelet products. Massive blood transfusion protocols were also developed in collaboration with hospitals to provide swift and efficient blood support to trauma patients and obstetric patients with severe bleeding. The formation of the Service Management & Industry Development Office (SMIDO) in the Health Products Regulation Group has deepened our engagement with stakeholders in the healthcare sector and the industry. In addition, our new HSA-wide customer relationship management system is now in place to manage feedback and engage our stakeholders more effectively and efficiently. With regard to service quality, both our Applied Sciences and Blood Services Groups embarked on 13 Lean Six Sigma projects, leading to significant improvements in processes and performance. As a result, our partners and stakeholders have benefited from better and faster service. In the same vein, the second DNA Profiling Laboratory was set up to handle increased workload demands and ensure business continuity. We also set up our second satellite site, Bloodbank@Dhoby Ghaut, to make blood donation more convenient and accessible for our donors in the city area, and to reach out to new younger donors.What are some of HSA's key achievements? Q HSA Annual Report 2012/1309 As an organisation, we continually look at reviewing, refining and refreshing our internal processes. We are focusing on further building our risk management frameworks and upgrading systems to ensure greater transparency, openness and feedback. We have a dedicated Internal Audit and Risk Management department that ensures our audit mechanisms continue to be broadened and strengthened. Through working with experts, we make sure that our organisational risk management framework is better customised to HSA's unique scientific responsibilities. The HSA Academy aims to be a growth engine for fostering scientific thought leadership. In helping the three HSA Professional Groups seek expert advice and co- develop solutions, the Academy has been engaging stakeholders and international experts in discussing key scientific issues with a view to identify innovative yet practical approaches that can define ways for HSA to better fulfil our public health mission. As people are our critical resource, we have also been working on enhancing our talent management, retention and development programmes. We aim to develop and optimise our existing talents, strengthen succession, and more effectively collaborate with our international partners and experts, as well as local academic institutions, through specialist panels and joint appointments. Sharing, mentoring, training and developmental efforts are being stepped up to ensure that with a larger and more diverse family, we can still maintain our high scientific and service standards, grounded on our Core Values and HSA identity. Many HSAians are already highly valued for their advice and contributions in a wide range of international forums and settings. This is something we must continue to build on and develop, especially in growing our next generation of professional and scientific experts.What areas of development are HSA working on right now? QWe are focusing on further building our risk management frameworks and upgrading systems to ensure greater transparency, openness and feedback. HSA Annual Report 2012/1310 Looking forward to the next year and beyond, we remain committed to serving Singaporeans and the world in advancing the areas of health sciences we are accountable for. We will keep our focus and continue to collaborate with our stakeholders to ensure sustainable business models, in particular the Applied Sciences and Blood Services Groups. HSA will be embarking on its 4-in-1 organisational excellence certification exercise. We will also continue to review our physical infrastructure needs and scientific requirements to ensure our future readiness, and nurture the next generations of scientific and regulatory experts across our applied sciences, blood services and health products regulation roles. I would like to thank our many stakeholders, customers, and industry partners for their valued perspectives. I would also like to especially express my gratitude to and admiration for all my HSA colleagues for their dedication to advancing and fulfilling our organisational mission. We are collectively committed to our mandate of safeguarding and advancing national health and safety, and it is the HSA community that makes me confident that we can achieve this.What can we look forward to in the year ahead? QWe will continue to review our physical infrastructure needs and scientific requirements to ensure our future readiness and nurture the next generations of scientific and regulatory experts.HSA Annual Report 2012/1311HSA Annual Report 2012/1312HSA Annual Report 2012/1313Board Executive Committee Professor John Wong Chairman Assoc Professor John Lim Member Ms Serene Wee Member Professor K.

2012/1323 HSA Annual Report 2012/1322 Through a robust and progressive regulatory framework as well as a responsive and collaborative approach that includes strong international regulatory networking, we ensure that health products in Singapore meet required safety, quality and efficacy standards.Working with healthcare professionals, industry players, and law enforcement agencies, these valuable connections help us sharpen our capabilities and enhance the effectiveness of health products regulation in Singapore. Stakeholders TrustHealth Products Regulation GroupCONNECT ADVANCE&HSA Annual Report 2012/1323 HSA Annual Report 2012/1322 Reduced Requirements and Costs for Class A Device Dealers Introduced on 1 January 2013, importers and wholesalers dealing solely with low-risk Class A medical devices are exempted from the Good Distribution Practice for Medical Devices in Singapore (GDPMDS) certification issued by accredited third party bodies. Instead, they are assessed by HSA based on their compliance with Quality Management System Requirements for Class A Only Medical Device Importers and Wholesalers (QMS CAD), and subject to post-market surveillance and monitoring. This new system benefits dealers through less documentation and saves them the cost of GDPMDS certification fees.Validity of GMP Certificate Extended Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Certificates issued to manufacturers of medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients are now valid for three years, instead of two. This took effect on 1 February 2013 after considering international practice and feedback from the industry. Ensuring Safety, EfFicacyQuality & Working with manufacturers, importers and the healthcare industry in Singapore as well as our regulatory partners around the world, we ensure safety, quality and efficacy standards are met before health products are allowed into Singapore. They are then tracked by robust post-market surveillance and enforcement.HSA Annual Report 2012/1325 HSA Annual Report 2012/1324Simpler Submissions Submissions are now made simpler for medical device registrations and complementary health products notifications with the launch of step-by-step guides. Improved System for Change Notification From 1 October 2012, applicants of minor variations applications (MIV-2) no longer need to wait for 40 working days after submission. They are now notified once the processing of the MIV-2 has been completed. This provides greater transparency and allows faster implementation of proposed changes by applicants. We are always on the lookout for new and innovative ways to improve our stakeholders' experience. From feedback and surveys, we review our processes and practices constantly to facilitate smooth processes for all our partners.FriendlyMaking it for our Partners HSA Annual Report 2012/1325 HSA Annual Report 2012/1324Berberine is Back We have relaxed the control of Chinese Proprietary Medicines (CPM) containing berberine in Singapore. From January 2013, sale of CPM containing berberine has been allowed, as long as the product is listed with HSA. Products containing berberine will, however, require cautionary labels to inform consumers of the potential adverse effects and contraindications.HealthEvolution in Products Regulation With ongoing innovation and emerging information from research, we take a proactive approach in reviewing regulatory requirements to resolve current challenges and address emerging needs. HSA Annual Report 2012/1327 HSA Annual Report 2012/1326Faster Access, Lower Costs for Medical Devices Following changes to various regulatory frameworks, patients now have quicker access to medical devices as a result of shorter turnaround times. Over the year, enhancements were made to Class B, C and D device registration through the introduction of new expedited evaluation routes with lower fees. Class A devices, with the exception of sterile devices, have been exempted from registration. In addition, Special Authorisation Route fees were lowered to help patients with unmet medical needs. Facilitating Exchange and Understanding Forums and dialogue sessions were organised for healthcare professionals, academic institutions and the industry, to encourage a culture of sharing and learning from each other. Through these engagements, our stakeholders' understanding of health products regulations have been enhanced. At the same time, this allows us to better understand their needs. HSA Annual Report 2012/1327 HSA Annual Report 2012/1326HSA Annual Report 2012/1329 HSA Annual Report 2012/1328HSA Annual Report 2012/1329 HSA Annual Report 2012/1328New ScientiFIc Advancing and Knowledge Clinical trials offer an important avenue in discovering new treatments and medicines. We ensure that clinical drug trials in Singapore are carried out safely, adhering to stringent international ethical and scientific quality standards. A Registry for Clinical Trials In August 2012, we launched a public clinical drug trials registry. With this registry, healthcare professionals and individuals are able to find out the types of clinical trials taking place and the ones they may consider for participation. It also enables the clinical research industry to make informed strategic decisions on conducting local clinical trials. Enhancing Quality We have been conducting training, workshops and providing consultations to help stakeholders better understand the expectations of regulatory standards and the critical system process controls. Educational guides and newsletters on Good Clinical Practice have also been published to improve quality control and assurance management. MedicalHSA Annual Report 2012/1331 HSA Annual Report 2012/1330New ScientiFIc An Eye on Pharmacogenetics HSA and the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health (SSHSPH) jointly developed the Singapore Pharmacogenomics Portal for comparison of genetic variation between the main ethnic groups in Singapore and other populations from around the world. This portal aims to facilitate regulators and researchers to compare genetic variations across several global and local populations for genetic variants that affect drug responses, dosages and adverse drug reactions. Separately, in a collaboration with National University Hospital, Singapore General Hospital, Changi General Hospital and the Singapore Immunology Network, the first phase to study the genetic association of drug-induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN) in the local population was completed by the end of 2012. A key outcome from this initiative showed a strong association between the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) and SJS/TEN in Singaporeans who carry the HLA-B*1502 allele. A cost-effectiveness study by the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, in collaboration with HSA, also showed that it is cost-effective to genotype newly-diagnosed epilepsy patients in Singapore. Together with MOH, we announced genetic testing of HLA-B*1502 prior to initiation of CBZ therapy in new Asian patients as a standard of care from April 2013. MOH also approved a 75% subsidy for this genetic test for subsidised patients in the restructured hospitals and institutions. Significant measures implemented on 1 March 2013, in line with the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, were: Revision of health warning labelling pictorials and text messages on all tobacco packaging to improve the impact on health messages to users Banning of descriptors on packaging (for example \"light\", \"mild\", \"low-tar\"), to prevent users from being misled that certain tobacco products are less harmful than others Lowering of cigarette tar and nicotine yield limits from 15 mg to 10 mg and from 1.3 mg to 1.0 mg in line with international benchmark limits Requiring all cigarillos to be sold in packets of 20 sticks to make it less affordable for the young From new research studies on genetic testing, improving the systems for medical devices, to enhancing legislation, here are some of our key developments in the year. Enhanced Legislation on Tobacco Products and PackagingHSA Annual Report 2012/1331 HSA Annual Report 2012/1330 Stubbing Out Illegal Electronic Cigarettes A network of four local major suppliers of electronic cigarettes was stubbed out during the 3-day Operation Trident. The identities of the suppliers were established through cyber forensics and intelligence gathering. A total of 491 electronic cigarettes, valued at an estimated profit worth of $59,000 and $73,000, were seized. Illegal Sales Stopping Clampdown on Illegal Codeine Sale In two operations, we cracked the illegal sale of codeine cough syrup to addicts through medical clinics. In Operation Shenton, a clinic employee and three patients were found selling 2,450 bottles of cough syrup and profited a sum of $24,500. They were sentenced to between two and three months in prison. In Operation Focus, a medical practitioner was found to have sold excess codeine to three patients. These patients, who were also addicts, went on to supply the cough syrup to the black market. Investigations revealed that the doctor illegally supplied more than 800 canisters of cough syrup and had profited over $500,000. The medical practitioner was sentenced to 7.5 months imprisonment and fined $60,000. The patients were each sentenced to between two and four months of imprisonment. We take a holistic approach, incorporating enforcement to complement our regulatory system to keep the market and public safe. During the year, we uncovered various activities that contravened the health product laws and followed through with swift and decisive actions. HSA Annual Report 2012/1333 HSA Annual Report 2012/1332 Errant Tobacco Retailers and Underage Smoking A total of 22 tobacco retail licensees received a 6-month suspension for selling tobacco products to minors (persons under 18 years of age). This was on top of the three tobacco retail licences that were revoked and prosecuted in court for selling tobacco products to minors in school uniforms. Through regular checks on tobacco retail outlets and popular sites where minors congregate, HSA and its authorised officers caught 5,711 underage smokers during the year. Swift Action against Illegal Online Sales We detained a female suspect for the sale of birth control pills, Viagra tablets and pregnancy test strips online. In her possession were 3,000 units of oral contraceptives, condoms and pregnancy test kits amounting to a street value of $5,685. This was the highest value of products seized from an individual caught for illegal online sale and the first case of illegal online sale involving both medicinal products and medical devices. The suspect was convicted and fined $19,000 in lieu of 38 weeks of imprisonment. It was the most severe penalty meted out to an individual for the sale of illegal health products online.Adulterated Capsules for Joint Pain After two people suffered serious adverse reactions from consuming complementary medicine capsules to relieve joint pain, HSA initiated investigations. These capsules were found to contain dexamethasone, a potent steroid used for anti-inflammatory purposes. A sting operation was conducted to disrupt the source of the adulterated products. The accused were charged and sentenced to between two and four months of imprisonment. Illegal Health Products Fight Goes Primetime We collaborated with the Singapore Police Force, and worked with MediaCorp to produce an episode for CrimeWatch to alert the public on the dangers of illegal health products and at the same time, assure the public that illegal peddlers would be caught and punished. The episode was aired in the four official languages - English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil in May and June 2012.Operation Pangea: A Global Crackdown HSA took part in Operation Pangea, for the fifth year in a row, from 25 September to 2 October 2012. In this concerted week of action, 38 Internet platforms were screened, and 15 sites were found to be selling illegal health products. We seized close to 13,000 units of products worth an estimated $18,000. Ten individuals were investigated for suspected illegal sale of these products, which included medicines such as oral contraceptives, weight-loss products and medical devices such as contact lenses, condoms and pregnancy test strips. One of our cases was featured in INTERPOL's Operation Pangea Public awareness video.HSA Annual Report 2012/1333 HSA Annual Report 2012/1332Awarded for Excellence In recognition of our enforcement efforts in two multi-agency operations, our enforcement officers were awarded the Certificates of Appreciation for Operational Excellence from Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs. In addition, 29 of our HPRG staff were also awarded the Service Excellence Award 2012, a national award that recognises individuals who have delivered quality service. Awarded for ISO 9001 :2008 The Tobacco Regulation Branch (TRB) was first awarded the Quality Management System - ISO 9001:2000 certification in March 2008. This was subsequently upgraded to the ISO 9001:2008 version in 2010. In January 2011, TRB successfully passed the re-certification audit. Recognising Good Work We are proud of our team members who excel at their work and go the extra mile to get the job done.HSA Annual Report 2012/1335 HSA Annual Report 2012/1334Connecting withour Partners In line with our Core Value \"Passion for Excellence\", we believe in being there for our partners and stakeholders, enhancing our processes to improve efficiency and allow more readily accessible information. Side-by-side with our Stakeholders To showcase our commitment in working together with our industry stakeholders, we launched our stakeholder engagement and service campaign \"NEX2US - Connecting with Our Partners\" in February 2012. The campaign kicked off with a NEX2US campaign video ad the first issue of our NEX2US newsletter. Published bi-annually, the newsletter showcases the latest regulatory developments, updates and events in the health product industry . A Personal Touch with Hospital Liaison Officers Established in October 2012, the appointment of Hospital Liaison Officers for Fortis Colorectal Hospital and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital is an initiative to increase knowledge sharing of our regulations and policies, and foster a relationship of trust between hospitals and regulator. Senior management of both organisations met with HPRG to discuss ways to resolve challenges in medical device access and procurement issues faced by the new hospitals. This resulted in roadshows to share medical device regulatory requirements and encourage medical device adverse event reporting. HSA Annual Report 2012/1335 HSA Annual Report 2012/1334Enhancing Collaboration AND COOPERATION Inking Partnerships In October 2012, HSA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, highlighting pharmacogenetics as a key area of cooperation. We also signed an MOU with the Medicines Evaluation Board of the Netherlands on 28 January 2013 to facilitate information exchange and cooperation in the area of health product regulation. A confidentiality agreement was signed with the European Directorate for Quality of Medicines and Healthcare of the Council of Europe with which we will cooperate and share information related to quality and manufacturing of substances for pharmaceutical use. The second bilateral meeting between the Ministry of Health Malaysia's National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau and HSA was held on 31 January 2013. From the meeting, we have committed to enhance information sharing over border enforcement issues and will work towards further collaboration in the area of evaluation and audit for health products.Working together with local and international agencies gives us immense opportunities to expand our knowledge and further our cause in protecting and advancing public health. HSA Annual Report 2012/1337 HSA Annual Report 2012/1336Engaging in Singaporethe World Working Towards Regulatory Convergence and Cooperation Over 300 health and pharmaceutical experts from all over the world gathered at the second Drug Information Association (DIA) Asia Regulatory Conference, hosted in Singapore for the first time. Held from 28 to 30 January 2013, the opening ceremony was graced by Dr Amy Khor, Minister of State for Health and Manpower. The conference themed \"Towards Regulatory Convergence and Cooperation to Improve Access and Quality\" served as a platform for delegates to exchange views and identify specific areas to enhance patient access to new and improved medicines. It also touched on ensuring the viability of global supply chains, the importance of post-market and active surveillance, and combating counterfeit health products. The Asia Regulatory Conference was co-organised by the DIA, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and HSA. As host to various regional and international events in Singapore, we seek to engage, share and learn from experts, regulators and industry stakeholders from around the world.HSA Annual Report 2012/1337 HSA Annual Report 2012/1336PIC/S Expert Circle Meeting on Human Blood, Tissues and Cells Regulators and inspectors from 26 countries gathered in Singapore for the 19th Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) Expert Circle Meeting on Human Blood, Tissues and Cells, hosted by HSA in October 2012. HSA accepted the invitation to join the PIC/S Steering Committee for the expert circle at the meeting. WHO-HSA Inter-regional Pharmacovigilance Training Course Over 40 participants, including more than 20 overseas delegates from ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific came to Singapore in October 2012 to attend a 3-day WHO-HSA Inter-regional Pharmacovigilance (PV) Training Course. Jointly organised by WHO and HSA, with participation from the Uppsala Monitoring Centre, this course focused on the advanced topics of pharmacoepidemiology and data mining. Learning from Visiting Experts Two visiting experts under the Health Manpower Development Programme imparted their valuable knowledge and resources to HSA and our stakeholders through training courses. They were: Professor Stephen Evans, Pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, December 2012 Professor Joga Gobburu, School of Pharmacy, University of Maryland, 21 January to 7 February 2013 Meeting with the World's Pharmaceutical Experts HSA Annual Report 2012/1339 HSA Annual Report 2012/1338Attachment of Staff from the Health Enforcement Unit, Ministry of Health of Brunei Darussalam In October 2012, our partners from the Health Enforcement Unit, Ministry of Health of Brunei Darussalam, were attached to our Tobacco Regulation Branch to study our enforcement best practices in curbing smoking by minors, and errant tobacco retailers, as well as the administration of the tobacco licensing system. Attachment of Staff from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, Korea We hosted a staff member from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, for a period of 15 months from April 2012, to understand our regulatory frameworks and processes across the product life cycle. Study Visit to the Malaysia National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau The 1-day visit to the Malaysia National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) in November 2012 focused on NPCB's ISO 9001 certification process as well as the implementation of the quality systems in the seven regulatory centres of NPCB. Working Together towards Common Goals We have been actively involved in work-sharing efforts since the Head of Agencies Consortium comprising our international partners - Health Canada, Australia Therapeutics Goods Administration and SwissMedic - was established in 2007. The group's efforts on work-sharing for generic products applications are ongoing and there have been more streamlining in the regulatory processes. It has initiated a plan of action that includes reviews sharing, staff exchanges and identifying opportunities for convergence. This is expected to serve as a \"proof of concept\" for broader international initiatives underway in this area. In addition, the consortium has joined hands with the Centre for Innovation in Regulatory Science (CIRS) to work on the CIRS Consortium on Benefit-Risk Assessment initiative. In July 2012, we joined the Communications Working Group under the umbrella of the Head of Agencies Consortium to share best practices, challenges, approaches, outcomes and lessons learnt. Through the work group, we aim to develop more effective communication methods on therapeutic products regulation for external stakeholders. HSA Annual Report 2012/1339 HSA Annual Report 2012/1338Harmonising Frameworks We have been actively involved in ASEAN harmonisation efforts for Traditional Medicines and Health Supplements aimed at reducing technical barriers to trade without compromising safety, including: Host for 17th Traditional Medicines and Health Supplements Product Working Group (TMHS PWG), June 2012 Co-chair for 16th, 17th and 18th ASEAN TMHS Scientific Committee (ATSC) meetings, from September 2012 to March 2013 Chair for 17th TMHS PWG meeting in Singapore, June 2012 and 18th TMHS PWG meeting in Brunei, November 2012 GMP for Traditional Medicines and Health Supplements The ASEAN Traditional Medicines and Health Supplements GMP (TMHS GMP) Taskforce has successfully completed the development of the ASEAN Guideline on GMP for TMHS which was endorsed in November 2012.

This guideline is used by the industry and regulators to ensure that drug manufacturers have in place processes that are capable of consistently producing finished products of the required quality.ASEAN Sectoral MRA on GMP Inspection Following the 1st Joint Sectoral Committee Meeting that HSA chaired in Bangkok, the inspection services of Singapore (HSA), Malaysia (National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau) and Indonesia (National Agency for Food and Drug Control) were accepted as Listed Inspection Services under the ASEAN Sectoral Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA). With this, ASEAN Member States will recognise and accept GMP certificates and inspection reports issued by Listed Inspection Services without the need to conduct a separate audit. HSA Annual Report 2012/1341 HSA Annual Report 2012/1340The Science of Beauty The cosmetics industry and its regulating authorities around the region convened at the 17th and 18th meetings of the ASEAN Cosmetic Committee and ASEAN Cosmetic Scientific Body. Held in July and November 2012 in Cambodia and Indonesia, topics of discussion included the review of safety of cosmetic ingredients and the regional efforts in post-market surveillance of cosmetic products.Countering Counterfeits with Technology At the APEC Patient Safety and Detection Technology Workshop in September 2012, we presented \"Product Quality Surveillance in Detecting Substandard and Spurious Medicines\", which covered the appropriate use of detection and prevention technologies for drug safety. We also discussed future global cooperation related to the use of detection technologies to promote drug safety. Learning from Our Hong Kong Counterparts In November 2012, we visited Hong Kong's Tobacco Control Office to study its experience in handling tobacco control challenges and establish useful networks for future cooperation and collaboration. Stamping Out Pharmaceutical Crimes Enforcement officers from across Asia learnt how to effectively detect and combat pharmaceutical crimes at various enforcement training programmes hosted by HSA over the year, including: Storm Enforcement Network, \"Train-the-Trainer\", April 2012 Singapore-United States Third Country T raining Programme, \"Combating Counterfeit Health Products\", August 2012 Training on Pharmaceutical Crime, February 2013 HSA Annual Report 2012/1341 HSA Annual Report 2012/1340HSA Annual Report 2012/1343 HSA Annual Report 2012/1342 We are committed to making it easier and safer for donors, hospitals, and healthcare professionals. Together, we strive to make a positive difference to patients' lives.People HopeBlood Services GroupCONNECT ADVANCE&Making blood donation a convenient and pleasant experience is the best way to encourage donors to give the gift of life. HSA Annual Report 2012/1343 HSA Annual Report 2012/1342 Keeping it SustainableSafe and The Blood Services Group (BSG) has made key advances during the year to ensure that the national blood supply to patients continues to be safe and adequate. The following section showcases practical applications of new knowledge, as well as systemic enhancements made in our efforts to advance transfusion medicine and maintain a ready supply of safe blood products for hospitals, healthcare professionals and patients.Better Way of Preparing PlateletsScreening for Malaria Keeping Singapore's blood supply free from existing and emerging threats to transfusion medicine is a priority of the Blood Supply Management at BSG. In April 2012, we implemented the Malaria Antibody Screening for blood donations from people who have been to malaria- endemic areas. Through this new screening protocol, BSG aims to safeguard blood supply coming from these donors who are considered at-risk of malaria infection. BSG recognises the importance of maximising the use of each whole blood donation by processing the blood into its various components. In 2012, we implemented the buffy-coat (BC) method as part of our routine process. This new platelet preparation method allows blood components to be produced from whole blood donations, enabling white cell filtration and pre-storage pooling of platelets for easier administration. The BC method also allows platelets to be prepared more efficiently up to 24 hours after the blood is collected. That is a four-fold improvement on the conventional limit of six hours.HSA Annual Report 2012/1345 HSA Annual Report 2012/1344Improving Flow In September 2012, BSG provided hospitals a stockpile of pre-pooled cryoprecipitate, a concentrated component rich in a blood-clotting protein obtained from the thawing of frozen blood plasma. Used in the treatment of patients whose blood have a reduced or dysfunctional ability to clot naturally, this ready inventory ensures that these patients can now receive cryoprecipitate transfusions in a more timely manner. Speedier Outcomes, Lower Costs BSG regularly reviews processes and leverages newer and more efficient testing technologies for speedier outcomes. Among the new capabilities introduced is a new processing methodology for classifying HLA alleles \u2014 Polymerase Chain Reaction based on Reverse Sequence Specific Oligonucleotide (PCR- RSSO). This highly efficient new technique has significantly reduced processing time and costs, allowing the processing of up to 96 platelet donor samples at any one time. Explaining Blood Transfusions Helping patients understand what blood transfusion is all about - the process and its possible risks - enables them to make informed decisions. To this end, BSG worked with the Corporate Communications department to produce a patient information leaflet, developed in the four official languages, for distribution to all hospitals. Introduced in October 2012, this informative campaign is designed to help doctors explain the procedure to patients when seeking consent for blood transfusion.Enhancing the Success of Transfusions Blood transfusions are sometimes ineffective because patients are unable to achieve the desired level of blood platelets after receiving blood due to immunity. In a majority of these cases, antibodies against Human Leucocytes Class I Antigen (HLA) in the patient's blood are the primary cause. To support patients with such needs, BSG's Transplant Support Laboratory has embarked on a project to screen for HLA in donors who undergo apheresis to supply blood components to patients with specific needs. The tests are performed using the Polymerase Chain Reaction - Sequence Specific Primer (PCR-SSP) methodology where HLA-A, B and C can be accurately typed for enhanced matching, thereby enhancing the probability of transfusion success.HSA Annual Report 2012/13 45 HSA Annual Report 2012/1344Donating Blood in the City Youths and the young at heart can now donate blood in the heart of the city. Following the success of Bloodbank@Woodlands, a second satellite collection site was established at Dhoby Ghaut Xchange on 28 September 2012. The launch was officiated by Minister for Health, Mr Gan Kim Yong. Bloodbank@Dhoby Ghaut achieved 3.5% of the total blood collection for 2012 within the first three months of operation. The location, chosen for its accessibility and healthy youth demographic has attracted more youth donors compared to our other collection sites. At Bloodbank@Dhoby Ghaut, youth donors make up 40.7% of the total donor pool. We will continue to build on Bloodbank@Dhoby Ghaut's success in driving BSG's strategy to decentralise our network of fixed donation centres for the convenience of donors across the country. BSG depends on the generosity of volunteer blood donors to ensure that the transfusion needs of patients continue to be met. Hence, making the blood donation process as convenient and pleasant as possible is instrumental to our mission's success. Here are some key advancements we made in the year.Happy and DonorsEngageD Key to Constant Blood Supply Donors Park Free at Wo o dlands BSG has made arrangements for complimentary parking whenever donors donate at Bloodbank@ Woodlands, Woodlands Civic Centre. Implemented in May 2012, this gesture is just one of the many ways we hope to continue enhancing the overall experience of donors, and to show them our appreciation for their support.HSA Annual Report 2012/1347 HSA Annual Report 2012/1346Faster Access to Platelets Patients now have quicker access to platelets. A new workflow with the Restructured Hospitals, implemented in the year, now allows the direct collection and issue of platelets for patients with low platelet counts, cutting down on consultation with BSG's on-call physician. This decentralisation of platelet storage has seen tremendous benefits with decreased workload for hospital blood bank staff and clinicians, leading to a productivity boost that enhances patient care. Time is of the essence, especially in life-threatening situations such as the case of young patients with heart or lung issues in the intensive care unit (ICU). To better support paediatric patients at the KKH (KK Women's and Children's Hospital) Neonatal ICU, we began supplying standard packs of blood products that can be readily used for Emergency Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). These special blood products, now promptly available, are used to prime the ECMO device at the onset for neonatal patients requiring urgent ECMO support for failing heart or lung functions.A Cost-Saving Design An innovative, yet simple design of a movable stainless steel tray has effectively saved us up to 50% in costs. This newly installed tray eliminates the need to cater two blood mixer machines per chair, along with their routine calibration and preventive maintenance. During emergencies, the time taken to retrieve blood and platelets is vital in saving lives. As such, BSG has taken steps to support hospitals and patients with new ways to access blood and blood products whenever the need arises. A New Identity Over the years, blood donors have carried paper-based donation cards that required their personal details and appointments to be recorded manually. In April 2012, Bloodbank@HSA began issuing new plastic donor cards to replace the paper version. The new plastic cards were also implemented at Bloodbank@Woodlands in July 2012. With this enhancement, the new cards capture essential information such as the donor's name, NRIC and blood type, speeding up processing, and cutting down waiting times. Besides using the card to book their next donation appointment, donors can also locate the nearest blood bank simply by scanning the QR code on the card. All Packed and Good to Go Special Blood Packs for Emergency PaediatricsHSA Annual Report 2012/1347 HSA Annual Report 2012/1346Working Together, Saving Lives Building good working relationships with our partners have boosted BSG's effectiveness in keeping the nation's blood programme safe and sustainable. Our myriad of collaborations with local, regional and international organisations, and individuals have also helped us stay at the forefront of technologies and capabilities in our field. These key collaborations will enable us to make more impactful contributions in the road ahead. Strengthening Ties with the Singapore Red Cross Over the past 11 years, BSG and the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) have been working hand in hand, through voluntary blood donation programmes, to ensure an adequate supply of safe blood and blood products for patients in Singapore. A strategic retreat was conducted in August 2012 to review how the partnership will meet new challenges for the years to come. A key outcome of the retreat was the formation of the HSA-SRC steering committee which meets twice a year to discuss the strategic direction for the National Blood Programme. A joint action plan was also developed for the National Blood Programme to deepen engagement with our multiple stakeholders, across public, private, civic and media organisations, to enhance our efforts towards maintaining a safe and sustainable national blood supply. HSA Annual Report 2012/1349 HSA Annual Report 2012/1348Fighting Blood Diseases with Cell Therapy Clinical researches help physicians narrow down and find the most effective form of care for their patients. Collaborating with other institutions, the Cell Therapy Facility (CTF) has embarked on several projects in its continuous effort to develop new cellular therapies to counter blood diseases. One such successful research initiative is the culture of Cytokine-Induced Killer (CIK) cells for patients with haematological malignancies. Working with the Singapore General Hospital, the initiative has been introduced as a routine service available to patients. Moving forward, CTF will also be involved in other projects which are currently in the translational and validation phases. These include the cord blood expansion project with Duke-NUS, and the T-regulatory cell isolation project with the Singapore Immunology Network. Solving Problems with Lean Six Sigma In the year, BSG adopted the Lean Six Sigma methodology to enable our staff to apply a simple structured approach to problem solving. The methodology also facilitates better communication and teamwork between cross-functional personnel in BSG. By employing Lean Six Sigma, seven projects were completed in 2012. Of these, three of the best projects were submitted for poster presentations at the International Society in Blood Transfusion Conference in Amsterdam. Over the next two years, we plan to develop a core group of black belt Lean Six Sigma practitioners who can take the lead to further improve our processes. HSA Annual Report 2012/1349 HSA Annual Report 2012/1348Excellenceof AABB Accreditation Renewed AABB has remained a symbol of authority and distinction in advancing the practice and standards of transfusion medicine and cellular therapies worldwide. In April 2012, we successfully renewed our accreditation with AABB after having completed the requisite assessment which we have been doing every two years since we first attained accreditation in 2006. This is testament to our strong commitment to quality and continuous improvement in the field of transfusion medicine.BSG has a strong reputation for its high standards in the processes and delivery of its services. Our long-standing accreditations with the world's most respected standards bodies in our field attest to the quality benchmarks we set for ourselves. Recognition CTF Accreditation Update We work hard to ensure that we can offer world-class healthcare to our patients. In doing so, we benchmark processes and procedures in our Cell Therapy Facility (CTF) to international standards. By implementing a quality management system, our high standards have been acknowledged with accreditations by international organisations. The first Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) audit was conducted by the Health Products Regulation Group (HPRG) in collaboration with Swissmedic for our cell therapy products in October 2012. In January 2013, the CTF was also assessed by the Joint Accreditation Committee - International Society for Cell Therapy and European Blood & Marrow Transplantation (JACIE). We were awarded the accreditation in July 2013. HSA Annual Report 2012/1351 HSA Annual Report 2012/1350 HSA Annual Report 2012/1351 HSA Annual Report 2012/1350 Welcoming Foreign Friends While we learn from others, we are also happy to share our best practices with others. In 2012, we hosted delegates from various organisations including: The Red Cross Blood Centre from the Xuzhou city of Jiangsu, China The Indonesia Red Cross from East and Central Java The Shanghai and Dalian Blood Centres The Beijing Blood CentreOne AnotherLearning Constant learning is not the only thing that keeps us growing and excelling. By forming and nurturing collaborative alliances with our wide network of local and international partners, we are finding newer and better ways to keep Singapore's blood supply safe and adequate.fromHSA Annual Report 2012/1353 HSA Annual Report 2012/1352Overseas Visits and Ideas Exchange To better understand how our overseas counterparts work, we visited blood centres in Beijing and Hong Kong in April 2012. We learnt the best practices of Beijing's efficient process management during disasters, as well as aspects of emergency planning in the capital's largest blood centre. In Hong Kong, we gained insights into how blood products inventory is managed to minimise outdating and to ensure adequate supply to meet hospital demands. On top of the opportunity to establish relationships with the blood banks overseas, these visits were also fruitful with the sharing and exchanging of ideas. Sharing Concepts on Blood Safety In collaboration with the HSA Academy, and with the support of the Ministry of Health, we organised the Risk-Based Decision Making in Blood Safety symposium to share the concepts of the topic as well as the perspectives from three international blood services in managing blood safety risks. With blood safety decision-making becoming increasingly complex, a half-day workshop was held in February 2013 to discuss the introduction of a framework that can guide decision-making for blood safety in Singapore. The event saw representatives from key stakeholders such as Hospital Transfusion Committees, regulatory agencies, legal and policy planning departments. HSA Annual Report 2012/1353 HSA Annual Report 2012/1352We devote time to looking at the future needs of the Singapore blood services system and its many stakeholders and beneficiaries. From how to improve the donor experience, to enhancing our research capabilities, and finding ways to apply new knowledge to meet and further our goals, BSG is committed to delivering a brighter and safer future by being exceptional in all we do.Doing MoreLooking Health Assessments, the E-fficient Way In our constant drive to enhance our donors' experience, we introduced a prototype e-questionnaire system for donor health assessments in February 2013. Donors were invited to try it and with their feedback, we aim to improve the system before its full implementation targeted for the third quarter of 2013. Supporting Ethics-based Research Together with HSA Academy, we have developed a research framework with clear guidelines on the use of donor samples in relevant research work. Implemented in June 2013, we support and advance healthcare and medical treatment relevant research based on ethical principles. A Better Match for Rare Blood Types While most people have blood types from one of the major blood groups, there are patients who have rare blood types. To best meet the needs of patients in our community who belong to rare blood types, a Rare Blood Donor Inventory will be set up, ensuring safe and adequate blood supply to all who need them.Forward, HSA Annual Report 2012/1355 HSA Annual Report 2012/1354Archiving Blood Samples for Future T ests A National Blood Donation Sample Repository System will be implemented for look-back investigations. This sample archive repository with a 12-month holding period will be beneficial in supporting and resolving investigations of potential transfusion- transmitted infections or other adverse events like transfusion-related lung injuries. New Process for Frozen Plasma We will be phasing in the new process of using plasma frozen within 24 hours (PF24). The new process will enable us to adopt safer approaches of using male- only donor plasma for transfusion purposes, and preventing transfusion associated acute lung injury. RFID Tracking to Ensure Blood Safety Following our successful pilot project with Tan Tock Seng Hospital of implementing RFID (radio frequency identification) technology in tracking blood units from collection to transfusion, we are planning to expand this initiative across more hospitals. With this system, we look forward to enhanced safety and more efficient healthcare delivery, minimising the risk of patients receiving the wrong type of blood. Expanding Our Cell Processing and Therapy Programme We recognise the many benefits that cell therapy has to offer and will continue to develop this programme. Our efforts include significantly expanding collaboration with national and international organisations in translational clinical projects, and provision of safe cell therapy products for specific disease treatments. HSA Annual Report 2012/1355 HSA Annual Report 2012/1354HSA Annual Report 2012/1357 HSA Annual Report 2012/1356 With a focus on continuous innovation and leveraging the best minds, we push the frontiers of knowledge and expertise, actively contributing to the scientific community and seeking to be the leader in our fields.We partner law enforcement agencies, regulators and the judiciary, and draw on the expertise of our scientists to serve the administration of justice and safeguard public health. Insights CapabilitiesApplied Sciences GroupCONNECT ADVANCE&HSA Annual Report 2012/1357 HSA Annual Report 2012/1356 Tracing Hit-and-run Culprits by Paints The success rate of the vehicle paint database (VPD) using blind test samples for hit-and-run incidents was shared with the Singapore Police Force (SPF). The Traffic Police from SPF has started to submit evidence to screen for vehicle paint smears and fragments, which were searched against the VPD for vehicle identification and comparisons. We have also increased the population of the paint samples in the VPD and used various statistical and database management software to enhance the search process of the database. As the national authority in forensic medicine and science, and chemistry testing, we provide specialised scientific and investigative services to support health products and food safety regulation, as well as hospital and law enforcement needs. inBreakthroughS Research Benchmarking of Measurement Capabilities We completed five regional and international comparisons over the year, examining trace elements in wine, pesticides in tea, essential elements in seafood and the purity of amino acids. We also completed a second collaborative project with Brazil's National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology on the determination of inorganic contaminants in Cacha\u00e7a, a distilled alcoholic beverage made from sugarcane. HSA Annual Report 2012/1359 HSA Annual Report 2012/1358Drug T esting through Hair Hair testing has recently been legislated in the Misuse of Drugs Act as an additional tool to detect drug abuse. This empowers drug enforcement officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau to procure hair samples from suspected drug abusers for analysis. Hair testing can detect drugs in a person's body even months after consumption, compared to urine tests which can only detect drug consumption a few days following usage. With this new initiative, we are developing the necessary capabilities and services in hair testing to detect drug abuse. Innovative Screening for Drugs We successfully developed the Ultra Fast Liquid Chromatography (UFLC) Screening System - the most comprehensive of its kind in the region. Allowing the screening of more than 707 common western drug substances in complementary health products, this system offers better resolution and capacity than the conventional LC Screening System. Faster , Better Cosmetics Analysis Colour additives, or colourants in cosmetics must be ensured safe to be allowed in cosmetic products. Employing a new chromatographic technique has allowed us to screen colourants faster. A total of 26 prohibited colourants can be analysed in a single run, allowing faster turnaround for cosmetics analysis. We also introduced a new testing service to determine the presence of the carcinogenic compound, N-nitrosodiethanolamine, in cosmetic products. We are looking to develop new acid testing methods for Alpha-Hydroxy-Acid in skincare products and Thioglycolic Acid in haircare products to increase the safety of cosmetics sold in Singapore by February 2014. Enhancing Metrology Services To assist laboratories in improving the accuracy and comparability of their test results, we expanded our External Quality Assessment Programme in Clinical Chemistry to include additional analytes and organised a proficiency testing scheme on the determination of toxic and essential elements in mushroom powder. We also produced two certified reference materials (CRMs) - toxic and essential elements in mushroom powder and toxic elements in cosmetic creams. These CRMs were sold to local testing laboratories as quality control and method validation samples.HSA Annual Report 2012/13 59 HSA Annual Report 2012/1358The Cutting Edge in Food Safety With state-of-the-art hybrid instrumentation, we are actively working on increasing the robustness of methods to enhance the accuracy and reliability of food safety tests. Some of the instrumentations used include Gas Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS-MS) Liquid Chromatography- Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). During the year, we offered 20 new testing services to the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore. These new tests, such as 4-methylimidazole in beverages by Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) and 3-monochloropropane- 1,2-diol and glycidyl esters in oils and flour by GC-MS- MS, were developed to support new regulations on food additives and food contaminants. These will also be used for research on emerging areas such as food contact materials and process technologies, or environmental contaminants.Taking Down New Psychoactive Substances New technologies have been developed to counter new psychoactive substances (NPS) in seized drugs. NPS are drugs that have been designed to evade legislative control, but provide psychoactive effects similar to controlled drugs such as Ecstasy. To better detect NPS in seized drugs, we developed a fast Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS- MS) method to target the screening of synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones and common controlled drugs. New Alkaloids T esting Capability Our testing capability in natural occurrence alkaloids was expanded to support the pre and post-market evaluation of complementary health products. We can now provide comprehensive screening of 34 toxic alkaloids from their 12 respective families of herbs. This capability enhances our investigation of adverse drug reactions associated with natural health products containing toxic alkaloids. We will also be developing a 2-Dimensional Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Time-of-Flight (2D GC/MS- TOF) analytical technique to enhance our capability in the analysis of chiral drugs and provide unambiguous identification of specific toxic natural alkaloids from structurally similar members of the alkaloid families, present in natural health products. HSA Annual Report 2012/1361 HSA Annual Report 2012/1360Getting the Lowdown from INTERPOL & US DEA In September 2012, we hosted Mr Noboru Nakatani, Executive Director of INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation (IGCI) who visited us for a discussion on pharmaceutical crime, digital technology and forensics. At the meeting, we presented our holistic approach for counterfeit drugs analysis. We also hosted Mr Scott Oulton, Associate Deputy Assistant Administrator of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in December 2012. He gave a seminar on the drug scene in the USA, the changing roles of the DEA, as well as technical areas such as drug profiling and investigating clandestine laboratories. He also led a roundtable discussion which was attended by Central Narcotics Bureau officers.Opening our Doors International Expertsto Expert Exchange on Forensics A 3-day Forensic Science Seminar held in March 2013 brought together three international experts - Dr Dwight Adams, Forensic Science Institute, University of Central Oklahoma, USA; Dr Tony Raymond, New South Wales Police Force, Australia and Mr Wim van Geloven, Netherlands Forensic Institute Academy, Netherlands, as well as Mr David Khoo and Mr Anandan Bala, Senior State Counsels from the Attorney-General's Chambers, Singapore, who shared their experience on forensic science services. Recognising the value that international experts can offer, we are setting up International Expert Committees for 3-year term, to provide professional and technical advice on the critical scientific aspects of the different disciplines in the forensic laboratories. This will ensure that we stay aligned with international best practices and that our staff are kept abreast of the latest advances. In seeking to further advance our capabilities in the arena of forensic science, we create opportunities to host the world's leading experts in related fields.HSA Annual Report 2012/1361 HSA Annual Report 2012/1360During the year, we continued to enhance our facilities and capabilities, with new and strengthened internal controls for greater accuracy and reliability in our processes. New DNA Lab at Biopolis Arising from our service level agreement with the Ministry of Home Affairs in 2011, we have strengthened our capability and enhanced the scientific scope of our forensic laboratories' services to support the operational requirements of the Home Team departments. This includes increased manpower and developing faster tests to deliver timely results. A second DNA laboratory was established at Biopolis and commenced operations in April 2012. The new laboratory incorporates negative air-pressure examination rooms and advanced wastewater monitoring systems in compliance to new biosafety and environmental standards. Additionally, custom- designed chambers have been built to cater to low-level touch DNA evidence. Our DNA laboratories are now identifying twice as many possible perpetrators to unsolved cases through matches to persons in the Singapore Police Force DNA Database. Boosting Capabilities, Bolstering Our Strengths HSA Annual Report 2012/1363 HSA Annual Report 2012/1362Containing an Outbreak In collaboration with ACRE Engineering, we initiated a BB2 (Mobile Containerised BSL-4 Autopsy Suite, also known as Blue Box 2) receptor deployment exercise known as Ex-Andromeda III in March 2013. This exercise comprised a mobile containerised autopsy facility that provides a high-level containment space to enable the autopsy of suspicious and highly infectious cases. In an outbreak situation, this facility will allow the recovery of biological materials for further investigation, with maximum containment at the national level while protecting the staff involved. The facility will also allow the investigation of homicidal deaths arising from acts of bioterrorism, to support law enforcement investigations. Our third exercise of its kind, the biennial event is aimed at testing the operational readiness of the BB2, processes and the people. Unlike the past two exercises, Ex-Andromeda III showcased its capability for night deployment. Renewing Our Commitment to Quality Our laboratories successfully achieved the Singapore Laboratory Accreditation Scheme (SAC-SINGLAS) annual re-accreditation in the Chemical, Biological, and Environmental fields in May 2012. The assessment passed without any major non-compliances, reaffirming the international quality standards of our labs. The Cosmetics Laboratory expanded its accredited list of prohibited colourants in the colourants screening test for cosmetics products, while the Food Safety Laboratory expanded its scope by 10 new tests. With the successful accreditation of the new methods, we can now offer our customers greater assurance of quality.Our Pharmaceutical Laboratories also took part in the External Quality Assurance Assessment Scheme, a proficiency test programme, organised by the European Directorate for Quality Medicines & Healthcare for the WHO. The scheme benchmarks the performance of our laboratories with our European counterparts, and the results validated our good standing. In addition, to ensure that excellence is inherent in every step of what we do, we established an independent Quality Team for our laboratories in October 2012. This unit, which is dedicated to quality assurance activities, comprises one director and six quality managers for the forensic and analytical laboratories.Automated Alerts for Instrument Maintenance To effectively control and maintain our laboratory instruments, we developed and implemented an Instrument Maintenance and Calibration Alert System for the Pharmaceutical Division's laboratories. This system is capable of providing real- time maintenance status of instruments and sending auto reminders to owners through emails when their instruments are due for calibration and maintenance. With the successful implementation, we plan to expand the project to include the other laboratories. HSA Annual Report 2012/1363 HSA Annual Report 2012/1362Swift Action on Chromium-Contaminated Drug Capsules Following the alert issued by the China Food and Drug Administration on chromium-contaminated drug capsules, we beefed up our post-market surveillance checks, especially on Chinese products likely to be affected by the incident. To support this urgent market investigation, our laboratory developed a method to analyse chromium contamination in capsule shells. A total of 317 pharmaceutical products were screened, and two products were found to contain more than 10 ppm of chromium. This swift response enabled HSA to take appropriate action on the contaminated products, safeguarding public health. Zeroing In on Zidolam-N Tablets Together with the WHO, we investigated three batches of Zidolam-N tablets that were suspected to be falsified anti-HIV medicines discovered in Kenya. Investigations showed that these suspected medicines were original products, but were diverted from the destination they were intended, and subsequently repackaged and sold illegally. Our results from the analysis supported the investigation - while the packaging of these products were counterfeit, the dosage form of the medicine was likely to be authentic although they were not similar to the batch indicated. WHO subsequently issued a warning against these falsified anti-HIV medicines in Kenya.International collaboration has enabled us to remain alert to new developments for adulterated drugs that are on sale in the market. Through supporting this effort of post-market surveillance, we reinforce HSA's ability to take targeted action to avert the sale of contaminated and counterfeit health products in Singapore.Protecting Health ProductSHSA Annual Report 2012/1365 HSA Annual Report 2012/1364Silver Award for a Sticky Collaboration We worked with the Raffles Institution (RI) on a project on the computer-assisted recognition of the textural surfaces of adhesive tapes.

As a collaborating centre, we provide monitoring information on the levels of contaminants in food to the Global Environmental Contamination Monitoring and Assessment Program. This helps to strengthen capabilities in contaminant monitoring and health impact.Taking the Lead in Applied Sciences We are committed to contributing to the global advancement of applied sciences by helping laboratories around the world raise and sustain their service quality. To this end, we actively participate in many international working groups such as the Scientific Working Group, Joint International Atomic Energy Agency / Food and Agriculture Organisation, Forensic Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry Network and the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes. We are the first non-European agency to participate in the network group meeting of Official Cosmetics Control Laboratories, organised by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and HealthCare. We are also part of the assessment teams for the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/ Laboratory Accreditation Board International assessment of two overseas laboratories. We also participated in a collaborative study with the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) to establish an acceptance range for USP Proposed LOT Q2 USP Prednisone Tablet to be used as the international USP standard calibrator for the Dissolution Apparatus Suitability Test. The inter-laboratory collaboration study involved more than 30 international government and industry laboratories. HSA Annual Report 2012/1369 HSA Annual Report 2012/1368Faster Paint Analysis Restructuring and training of staff at the Forensic Chemistry & Physics Laboratory has improved the number of cases meeting the TAT of their forensic paint analysis service for traffic accidents. They increased the number of trained staff at the critical stages of casework. Regrouping the team allowed for better case allocation and parallel processing of exhibits, which resulted in faster processing time. Finding New Efficiency Gains Through better arrangement of duty rosters to rationalise manpower and resources utility, and also refining testing processes and system workflow, the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory - Drug Abuse Testing Unit was able to increase the number of non-urgent routine cases meeting the target turnaround time (TAT).Driving Science Forward with Lean Six Sigma Improving our processes and performance is something that we constantly seek. By applying Lean Six Sigma into our operations, we have been able to make excellent headway in delivering more and faster service for our partners and stakeholders.HSA Annual Report 2012/1369 HSA Annual Report 2012/1368Streamlined Processes, Better Output The Analytical Toxicology Laboratory - Clinical and Forensic Toxicology Unit aimed to improve the percentage of clinical toxicology cases meeting the TAT. The solutions implemented included stepping up the training of junior scientists to enable them to handle more complex cases, streamlining workflows to reduce waiting time and unnecessary reworking. For example, scientists were required to review each case and send for further analysis if necessary, once the cases were submitted to them. Clearer guidelines and instructions were also provided to the laboratory staff to assist them to make better decisions and produce higher quality reports that did not need reworking. Cases were also prioritised according to the expected date of completion. With these processes in place, the number of cases meeting the TAT increased to 95%. Solving Crime Faster with Better Processes The DNA Profiling Laboratory aimed to reduce the TAT for Police Division crime cases with less than ten exhibits, from an average of 31 weeks to 13 weeks. The laboratory went through a process overhaul and increased staffing. New process schedules were developed and designated officers were rostered for the various processes. An optimal sample batch size was also determined so that the assigned officers could complete each test within the scheduled time. These changes enabled a consistent assignment of cases and reduced waiting time between processing steps. Eventually, the original target was surpassed and the average TAT was successfully reduced to 11 weeks. Staff morale also improved as the results helped in the speedy arrest of the perpetrators. Analysing Unknowns More Efficiently Analyses of unknown chemicals and materials are generally non-routine cases that follow some basic methodologies, requiring the examiner in the Forensic Chemistry and Physics Laboratory to select or modify the techniques according to the nature, quality and quantity of the evidence. To reduce the time required for method development, they re-delegated administrative work, created a searchable index for cases, compiled reference sources and literature searches, and trained more officers for competency in complex cases. Technical experts were trained to take charge of the analysis and to act as \"knowledge centres\". As a result, the number of cases meeting the TAT improved to 83%. Absent: Maggie Tiang Su Su, Koh Hui Low Hui Koon, Noorshahira binte Mohamad Absent: Jean Chen Xiu Xiu HSA Annual Report 2012/1371 HSA Annual Report 2012/1370Faster Submission, Better Customer Satisfaction It now only takes half an hour to complete the full registration of food sample at the Food Safety Laboratory. This was achieved through relocating the customer service counter and further streamlining the process. A dedicated customer service officer has also been assigned to the laboratory to facilitate registration of samples and documentation. This has greatly enhanced work efficiency and improved audit traceability. The team also worked with the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore to batch samples for submission at designated timings, to allow for better work allocation. The improvement has resulted in better overall internal and external customer satisfaction. Speeding Up Illicit Drug T ests The Illicit Drugs Laboratory was focused to meet its target TAT for testing of controlled drugs in possession cases. To achieve this, they allocated officers according to the drug type that they were most efficient in. These officers were also responsible for monitoring the progress. The team was also able to identify the optimum size and drug types that could be batched together for analysis. This has significantly improved the percentage of exhibits meeting the TAT. A 96% Success Rate The Pharmaceutical Laboratory aimed to increase the number of routine Product Quality Surveillance screening for western medicine cases completed within the targeted TAT to 96%. To do so, they collaborated with the Generics and Biosimilars Branch and the Enforcement Branch from Health Products Regulation Group to revise the workflow. Company testing methods were retrieved and standards of concerned pharmaceutical products were purchased at least two months in advance, based on the yearly operational list before the samples were sent in for testing. This enabled the laboratory to work on the cases immediately to achieve the target.

Strategies By developing a culture focused on excellence, and by creating opportunities to gather, learn and share, we champion an HSA that is stronger than the sum of its parts, and ready for the future. LeadershipCorporate HeadquartersCONNECT ADVANCE&HSA Annual Report 2012/1373 HSA Annual Report 2012/1372 Sustaining Our Success To be a truly future-ready organisation, we continue our pursuit of excellence through continuous learning and managing change. We are constantly reviewing and updating our corporate strategies and departmental operational plans. Sharing and discussion sessions are held regularly with the Professional Groups to ensure effective and timely implementation of plans. By taking an active approach in leading process improvement, we aim to excel in our 4-in-1 organisational excellence certification at the end of 2013.Enjoy, Exchange, Excite HSA believes in having our people gather often, to grow, bond, and learn in our journey as a family. In the past year, we continued the tradition of organisation-wide events such as our annual New Year gathering and Dinner & Dance, where everyone had the opportunity to relax and celebrate with fellow colleagues from across the different groups and departments. One for All, and All for Excellence At HSA, we are professionals driven by a shared passion to make a difference in people's lives every day - be it patients, consumers, industry partners, staff or members of the community. As an organisation, we are focused on sustaining and advancing our effectiveness and capabilities so that we can realise our vision, and deliver ever-improving value to all whom we partner and serve.HSA Annual Report 2012/1375 HSA Annual Report 2012/1374Strengthening Our Core HSA is a values-driven agency. The success we have enjoyed thus far is anchored by our Core Values which defines how we do everything - from retaining and attracting the best talents, to servicing both our internal and external customers. To enhance synergy across the organisation and promote a better understanding of our Core Values, the HSA-wide team building programme, that complements the regular orientation sessions, has continued to emphasise our Core Values. To refresh our HSA identity, we updated the visual icons that represent each of our five Core Values. All new HSA notebooks have the refreshed icons printed on them. To further reinforce our branding and reputation as a progressive employer, we have enhanced the layout and design of our recruitment advertisements and HSA career webpage, offering meaningful work and career progression with competitive compensation packages.Extra SPICE HSAians can now share their ideas and suggestions easily on the Shared Portal for Information, Collaboration & Engagement (SPICE). The new staff suggestion portal also simplifies the processes of reviewing suggestions, tracking the implementation stages and providing in-depth reporting for planning and tracking purposes. This ensures that no suggestion is left out and entrusts HSAians with greater ownership of their workplace environment. Empowering Our People Our people are the active force behind the long-term success of HSA as a trusted authority. We continue to support our staff by providing developmental programmes and activities that bring out the best in their work performance and overall well-being. One of our key platforms to promote a learning culture and to spread knowledge, ideas and growth-driving organisational excellence was the HSA Organisational Excellence Forum, held on 15 August 2012. Mr Ang Hak Seng, then-CEO of Health Promotion Board, was invited to share his experience on the pursuit of organisational excellence in the Public Service. We continued to conduct regular roadshows aimed at keeping our staff informed and updated on our latest policies and processes. Work-life balance talks were also conducted to help our staff enhance their personal productivity and discover more ways to find balance between work and personal life.HSA Annual Report 2012/1375 HSA Annual Report 2012/1374Perfecting Our Work We have completed a trial implementation of the Near-Miss Reporting Framework that helps to identify, analyse and share problems before they escalate into more serious issues. This has been found to be particularly useful for trending and early detection of systemic errors. Reporting such incidents provides opportunity for early rectification to enhance the quality of HSA's work. We are in the midst of streamlining the process so that it can be implemented across the entire organisation.A Showcase of Excellence In the spirit of innovation, learning and sharing, we took part in the PS21 ExCEL Convention in November 2012. We showcased HSA's excellence by hosting a learning journey for 80 public officers at the Bloodbank@ HSA, and shared with them how blood is collected and processed. At the convention, we conducted a public talk entitled \"Real or Counterfeit Medicine... Can You Tell?\", and showcased three projects by the Blood Services Group and Applied Sciences Group with live demonstrations within the exhibitors' booths. Frozen Blood Inventory Electronic System (FRIES) FRIES is an enhanced blood storage management system that provides real-time inventory information on frozen blood units. Using a barcode scanner, the status on the location of each frozen blood unit is updated in real-time at each station during storage and retrieval without compromising cold chain storage. Now, frozen blood units can be easily retrieved in a shorter time, meeting the needs of patients more effectively. FRIES has also allowed timely tracking of storage locations, improved storage space planning and raised overall efficiency . Forensic Examination of Counterfeit Medicines In the past, laboratory analyses of counterfeit medicines relied solely on the identification and quantification of its active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Now, the Forensic Chemistry and Physics Laboratory (FCPL) has developed a multidisciplinary method to examine both medicine and packaging. Optical microscopy methods are employed to examine the printing and security features of packaging materials. At the same time, an array of analytical techniques is applied to retrieve information on any excipient and adulterant content. This integrated technique also characterises medicines to determine their source of origin and offers a rapid, comprehensive and reliable way to differentiate counterfeit from authentic medicines. Forensic Examination of Drug Packaging Material Collaborating with the Central Narcotics Bureau, FCPL applies its forensic expertise in the investigation and prosecution of drug related offences. Through the use of advanced instrumentation and technologies, the analyses of drug packaging materials such as plastic bags, straws and tapes, can provide useful evidence to link a suspected trafficker or an abuser to a case or syndicate operation. To further complement drug enforcement work, forensic databases comprising information on various packaging materials are being developed to provide invaluable investigative leads to aid in the administration of justice. HSA Annual Report 2012/1377 HSA Annual Report 2012/1376Caring for the Community For the Young During the year, we organised an English Learning Journey for the students of APSN Katong School through a play based on popular children's author Eric Carle's books. To give them the opportunity to build their entrepreneurial spirit, we invited the students to set up a booth during our Public Service Observance & Learning Day where they sold their handmade items.HSA is committed to being a socially responsible organisation. Through our Corporate Social Responsibility framework, CARE (Community Action, Responsible for our Environment), we encourage our employees to contribute their time, talents and resources in three main areas of need: social volunteerism, preservation of environment, and cultivating a community-caring culture. For the Elderly Our project, \"HSA Care-in-Action through Sponsoring, Packing and Distributing\", saw 100 bags of household items given to the elderly. In addition, a charity bazaar held in conjunction with our National Day Observance Ceremony raised $3,470 worth of proceeds for the Lions Befrienders Service Association (Singapore). For Our Staff Our employees are our best assets, and having healthy employees makes us an even stronger organisation. As such, it is with great pride that HSA achieved the Platinum Award for the Singapore Health Awards 2012, with a score of 91.45%, up from 83.21% in 2010.HSA Annual Report 2012/1377 HSA Annual Report 2012/1376Our Digital Network Putting in resources to create an effective IT environment has played a vital role in allowing HSA to optimise value to all our stakeholders. From enhancing our security efficiencies, creating smoother workflows for our staff to boosting the donor experience at our blood banks and more, the benefits that we have gained are invaluable.Plugged In To counter any potential malicious activity, we have implemented the Next Generation Firewalls in mid 2013. In addition, we have upgraded our security services with the Government's Cyber Watch Centre to the Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to ensure that our Internet-linked networks are properly guarded against unknown threats from viruses and malware. We also began converting our Internet protocol version to IPv6 for our public facing systems and electronic systems. This communication protocol not only helps to increase the number of our IT addresses, but also has other advantages such as helping to save network bandwidth. In 2012, we achieved 75% of our rollout, with a 100% target by early 2013. Smooth Experiences A customer relationship management system was completed in end 2012. This system, complete with automated analytics and reporting, helps us manage feedback, enquiries and engage our industry partners more effectively and efficiently. A new email management system has been rolled out to ease the access to filed emails from a centralised electronic repository. This repository enables employees to search and retrieve valuable information and institutional knowledge that are contained in email exchanges. HSA Annual Report 2012/1379 HSA Annual Report 2012/1378Smart Consumers Our elderly can be vulnerable to unscrupulous sellers who promise miracle cures and treatments through well-packaged but illegal health products. Not only are they cheated of their hard-earned money, such products may harm their health and lead them to inadvertently forgo proper and necessary medical treatment. \"Guaranteed\" Cures Following the successful nation-wide campaign to curb illegal health products, which won a Bronze Award at the Singapore Press Holdings iink Awards 2012, a new public education campaign was launched in November 2012. With the aim of helping the elderly purchase health products smartly and safely, the new campaign focused on the dangers of illegal health products passing off as natural or traditional cures and obtained from dubious sources such as makeshift stalls or via word-of-mouth.These sellers entice buyers through false promises of guaranteed results, as well as exaggerated testimonials from \"past users\". Some of these common illegal medicines include painkillers for rheumatism and other 'cures' for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and high blood pressure. HSA's testing has established that such products are at high risk of being adulterated with unknown and harmful substances. To counter this, a comprehensive advertising campaign and micro-site (www.healthdangers.sg) reminded users that while it may be cheaper and convenient to purchase health products online or from unknown sources or even from friends; it is difficult for them to be sure of the safety and authenticity of the products. The advertisements also warned about possible fatal or serious health consequences. This campaign reached an estimated 2.2 million people through mainstream advertising and secured over 11 million online impressions. HSA Annual Report 2012/1379 HSA Annual Report 2012/1378Honouring Our Ambassadors HSA held its fourth Customer Service Day on 1 March 2013. Themed \"Touch Hearts, Win Hearts\", Mr Manoj Sharma from the Singapore Service Academy was invited as our guest speaker. In recognition for their contribution to service excellence, 36 officers and four teams were presented with the HSA Outstanding Service to Customers Awards.
