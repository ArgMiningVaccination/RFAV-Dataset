Qi is often translated as \"energy,\" but can also be understood as \"function.\" All of the functions of the body can be described in terms of its Qi. Each aspect of the body can have too much or too little. When the energy flow gets stuck or the amount is incorrect, symptoms are observed. Symptoms are created when the body is trying to re-establish a normal flow of Qi. The goal of Chinese medicine treatments is to help the body re-establish the normal amount and flow of Qi. Chinese medical therapy consists of diet, exercise, acupuncture, and herbs and can be beneficial in the treatment of many ailments. Acupuncture Acupuncture is several thousand years old and is the practice of placing thin, sterile, stainless steel needles in specific locations on the body to affect a specific response. These needles are so thin that several can be placed inside a vaccine needle. The needles are placed into acupuncture points. Most acupuncture points are located in the muscle layer under the skin; some are in the tendons. Microscopically, the acupuncture point is found to be a locus of fine nerve endings. Stimulation of a specific point will result in a specific, repeatable response. For dogs and cats, acupuncture is a simple, painless process, typically recommended at ongoing, regular intervals depending on the condition being treated. Treatment sessions take about 20-30 minutes and are easily tolerated. Acupuncture Medicine Herbal medicine involves the use of compound products administered most commonly in the form of tablets or powders. Most medicinal herbs are of plant origin, although some minerals and animal products are also used. Most Chinese herbal medicines are made up of five to 15 individual herbs. Formulas are designed to treat the syndrome, not a single symptom. Chinese Herbal Medicine therapies Classical homeopathy is based on the 18th century teachings of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann and seeks to cure the problem, not merely treat it. Homeopathy is based on the idea that the body creates symptoms in an attempt to heal itself. Persistent symptoms are evidence of the system needing help. Remedies (or medicines) work by stimulating a focused inflammatory response that supports what the body is already trying to do. This supports the theory of \"like cures like.\" That is, a substance that creates symptoms can be used to stimulate a cure of the diseased state. Symptoms are not the disease; they represent the illness. Symptoms are evidence the body is responding to a problem. Homeopathic remedies come from a wide array of plants, minerals, salts and some animal products. Homeopathic remedies are usually used individually, rather than in combination. Concurrent use of some conventional medications, especially steroids, may interfere with the body's ability to respond to homeopathic remedies.

Massage Therapy Just as for humans, massage therapy for dogs and cats can improve circulation, relieve tension and muscle strain, promote healing, and increase range of motion and flexibility. This hands-on treatment works well for pets suffering from chronic pain, anxiety issues, muscle spasms or atrophy, and problems associated with aging. Massage therapy has become an essential part of the canine athlete and working dog routine. Using massage techniques and trigger point therapy, we can enhance performance and potential, and improve quality of life.

Chiropractic care Animal chiropractic care has been practiced for more than 100 years as a treatment option to improve gait and mobility as well as alleviate pain. Growing in acceptance and popularity for dogs and cats, animal chiropractic care aims to improve and preserve the health of the neuromusculoskeletal system. Chiropractic therapy can be helpful in treating injuries or chronic conditions like arthritis. Chiropractic care & Rehab Physical therapy and rehabilitation for dogs and cats is often recommended post-operative care following orthopedic surgeries, but it is also helpful in treating and managing various debilitating conditions. Pets dealing with chronic pain or age-related conditions, or recovering from athletic or traumatic injuries, are common candidates for physical therapy and rehabilitation. Similar to what you may expect for human physical therapy and rehab, treatment sessions involve some hands-on massage and manipulation, but also exercises using equipment and tools, such as stability balls, elastic bands, weights, and treadmills. In addition to the current services offered, VHC has an underwater treadmill for rehab patients, as well as those seeking safe, pain-free exercise to help with conditioning and weight loss. Our Rehab provider is currently on leave. We do have a trained treadmill technician to provide that service. Animal Communication Animal Communication is an intuitive or telepathic connection between the communicator and the animal. Animal communicators can provide information on an animal's essence, life force, emotional state and how they're feeling physically (pain levels, where it hurts). People use animal communicators to understand challenging behavioral issues and assist their animals in becoming better family members. They also communicate upcoming changes to their animal (surgery, moves, new members), find out if they're ready to transition and say goodbye when the time is right.

They either want to know how their current diet is rated or they want to make a change because the pet is not doing well on the current diet. We are exposed to lots of information from friends, television ads, pet supply stores, nutritional advisors and veterinarians. There is no perfect diet since no one knows all of the nutritional needs of dogs and cats. The best that can be done is to feed as well as you can based on the information you have and make adjustments based on how things are going. At the Veterinary Holistic Center there are several options for finding answers to your feeding questions. Most of the doctors will provide general recommendations during your visit for other services which may include comments on the current diet and some general suggestions for changes. You also have the opportunity to make an appointment specifically focused on Nutritional Counseling. These consults will take into account how the pet is doing on the current diet and then suggest modifications to meet the pet's individual needs.
