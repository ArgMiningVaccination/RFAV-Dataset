Golimumab is in a class of drugs called biologics. It is administered to you as an intravenous(IV) infusion to reduce signs and symptoms of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as joint swelling, pain, fatigue, and length of morning stiffness. Golimumab is commonly known as Simponi Aria\u00ae. It can also be given as an injection. How do I take it? The intravenous infusion will be given to you by a healthcare professional. This procedure usually takes about 30 minutes. After you receive your first dose, you will get your second dose 4 weeks later and the following doses every 8 weeks. What about side effects? The most common serious side effect is infection. Golimumab can lower the body's ability to fight infection. Be sure to contact your physician if you have any signs of infection such as fever, cough, or red or painful skin; or if you are planning a surgery. You may have to stop Golimumab while being treated for an infection or if you are planning a surgery. You will need to have a negative tuberculosis (TB) skin test before beginning Golimumab therapy. Your doctor may also test for hepatitis B and C. You should not take a live vaccine (Flu-Mist nasal spray, chicken pox vaccine, shingles vaccine, measles booster) while on Golimumab, or within 3 months of stopping Golimumab.
