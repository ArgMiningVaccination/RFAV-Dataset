Professor Ian Owens joined us from Imperial College as our Director of Science and Dr Justin Morris from the British Museum has become our Director of Public Engagement. In response to the global economic crisis and subsequent decline in public funding, we are refocusing our work and structure to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Museum by generating yet more of our own funding and better demonstrating the impact and relevance of our work. We are extremely grateful to all our supporters, old and new, including the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The Museum's collections, comprising almost 80 million specimens, are of international importance. Our team of curators and researchers, and the knowledge and expertise the y have of our collections, are what makes us unique and of value to the global endeavour of science. Our collections can be used to address compelling questions about the natural world, such as how the genomes of the wild relatives of crop plants can help develop more sustainable agriculture for our growing population. It is our research and the research of thousands of others that make answers to these questions a reality. The refocusing of our science means that we will be more responsive to the challenges facing society today. We are now organised in a more multidisciplinary way and are collaborating with more external partners than ever before to answer the big questions of the day. We continue to invest in new equipment and facilities, including our molecular collections storage facility and our quarantine facility, to ensure we are able to deliver world-class science. Our science demonstrates our authority, but being an authority is not enough in itself. We have a mission to engage with the wider public and inspire them by the work we do. It is by being a voice of authority that we can also encourage a greater understanding of our place in, and impact on, the natural world, and this has ne ver been so important. In 2012 we welcomed five million visitors through our doors for the first time. This figure demonstrates our increasing appeal. It also - and much more importantly - testifies to a growing public interest in the environment, and a growing sense of public responsibility for it. We continue to be a museum that helps find solutions to the challenges of today, informed by the past, to create a better future. We are a voice of authority on the natural world.Dr Michael DixonDirector 5 million visitors were welcomed to the Natural History Museum in 2012 4 Overview from the Director of Science Distinctive, excellent and relevant This is a time of extraordinary opportunities for the Natural History Museum. Digital and molecular technologies are revolutionising the sciences that underpin our activity, as well as making it possible to disseminate our data and findings to a truly global audience. The urgent need for scientific solutions to environmental problems is stimulating ever greater public engagement with our work. Meanwhile a growing focus on scientific 'grand challenges' has encouraged previously competing organisations to work together to address major questions. As one of the world's great natural history museums, we must take advantage of these opportunities to answer questions of broad significance to science and society. A new age of discovery Our new five-year science strategy, A New Age of Discovery1, is designed to employ our unique expertise and collections to pursue a programme of scientific work that is distinctive, excellent and relevant. Based on our three focal areas of activity - scientific discovery, infrastructure and engagement - the strategy identifies five major challenges: Challenge 1: The digital NHM Challenge 2: Origins, evolution and futures Challenge 3: Biodiversity discovery Challenge 4: Natural resources and hazardsChallenge 5: Science, society and skills Over the next five years we will work with our collaborators and sponsors to make major contributions in all of these five areas, demonstrating the impact and value of our science. The new strategy also identifies a number of milestones to allow us to track our progress over this period. These include publishing 1,000 papers in leading international journals, ensuring that 20 million of our specimens are digitally a vailable, delivering one million face-to-face engagements between members of the public and our scientists, and raising \u00a310 million to fund our work on the major challenges. UK strategy for taxonomy and systematics We have formed an alliance with other leading institutions in the field to develop a national strategy for taxonomy and systematics, as recommended b y the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee. Our foci in this UK strategy are the five priority areas identified by the funder community: the development of a series of grand challenges, distribution of UK natural history collections, collection digitisation, identification tools for UK organisms, and training. Of these we see the first - a prioritised list of time-limited grand challenges to advance UK taxonomy and systematics - as being key in building a progressive and compelling vision that will inspire both the community and its sponsors.Key science achievements 2011 and 2012 Performance indices 1,200+ scientific papers 25 papers in Nature, Science and PNAS100,000+ scientific loans and visitors250,000+ face-to-face interactions between scientists and the public\u00a315m+ external science funding Improved collections infrastructure Large vertebrate store Centralised quarantine facilitiesNew archive store New molecular facilities Ancient DNA laboratory Next-generation sequencingMolecular collections repositoryThe nation's collections Building on the success of the Darwin Centre, we have completed a series of projects to ensure we can provide a secure physical home for the nation's natural history collections and make those collections available. The projects completed in 2011 and 2012 include a new large vertebrate store, centralised quarantine facilities and a modern store for the Museum's archives. These projects are part of a broader programme of work to ensure all our collections are housed in satisfactory physical conditions. In the coming years this programme will extend to our world-famous palaeontological and mineral collections, which are under threat from oxidation, and our vast collection of beetles, which is currently housed in a space designed as a public gallery. We will also begin the next phase in the development of our natural history library, which underpins so much of our taxonomic research and is at the forefront of the transformation from traditional paper-based literature to digital information. Genomic revolution We have also made substantial investments in our molecular facilities to apply modern genomic approaches to the information in our collections. During the two years covered by this review, and with the support of a number of our major sponsors, we have opened a new 'ancient DNA' laboratory, introduced next-generation sequencing in the Museum, and developed a molecular collections repository. Together, these new facilities will allow us to extract DNA from our historical collections, sequence a large number of genes from that DNA, and then secure the genomic products for future use and reference. We are already using these new facilities to probe the early evolution of humans, understand ancient patterns of climate change, explore microbial div ersity, and create genetic reference libraries for parasites and disease. In the next few years, the genomic facilities will play a key role in our work to develop new ways to rapidly discover and describe species in mega-rich systems. Organisation of the science group In order to deliver our new strategy we have also reorganised our structure. The overall objectives of the reorganisation were to: foster cross-disciplinary activities while at the same time maintaining disciplinary expertise and strong links between collections and research; better align our activities with external drivers; manage our resources more efficiently; make it easier to interact with other organisations; and reduce senior management salary costs. Following an extended period of consultation, we moved from a system with six largely autonomous science departments to one that has two large departments, Earth Sciences and Life Sciences, plus centralised Science Facilities, Library and Archives, and Science Administration. Laid across these departments is a series of cross-cutting initiatives and centres which focus on the five major challenges identified in our strategy. Having only joined the Museum towards the end of 2011, I can't take credit for the projects included in this review, but I do derive great pride from the huge variety of activities described here. This is a fascinating snapshot of what makes the Museum a unique national institution. It combines arguably the most important natural histor y collection in the world with deep scientific expertise and the opportunity to engage millions of members of the public with fundamental ideas about our place in the natural world. Over the next few years, we will build on these distinctive strengths to further increase the quality of our work and maximise its impact on science and society.Professor Ian OwensDirector of Science 5Global databases on vertebrates are being used to understand large-scale patterns of biodiversity and conservation6 Challenge 1 The digital NHM Connecting with a global audience Digital technology enables us to make our huge amount of collections, research and other information available to a truly global audience. We are in a time of rapid change that promises to revolutionise how collections are used to understand the natural world and to address environmental issues. We are playing a leading role in collaborations that are reinventing the way in which museums collect and store information, the way in which that information is made available, and the way in which the great natural history museums of the world work together as a global network. In particular, we are working with our partners to create digital collections, collaborative research environments, and tools that will enable rapid taxonomy, diagnostics and analysis of high priority groups. The Natural History Museum has a strong record of innovation and leadership that we will develop in coming years to place us at the forefront of a new generation of digital museums. High-throughput digitisation: making the Museum's collections accessible to all With almost 80 million specimens, the collections of the Natural History Museum are a unique source of information, and are indispensable for understanding our planet's past, present and future. Over the last decade, the Museum has dedicated increasing resources to the digitisation of its collections to make them more widely accessible. Our specimens range from the blue whale to micro-organisms. To digitise such a vast range of specimens we deploy industrial-scale methods based on automation. Unique barcodes are used to link specimens with derivatives - images, videos, preparations, field observations and DNA sequences. Three collections illustrate some of our approaches to digitisation - British butterflies and moths, Library and Archives, and botanical collections.British butterflies and moths Insect collections present one of the great challenges for specimen digitisation because of their vast size - the Museum's collections contain at least 30 million specimens. iCollections is the Museum's first large-scale digitisation project. In the next three years we shall digitise our entire collection of British moths and butterflies. This will give us a record of the British natural environment over the last two centuries that we will use to study long-term change. To create a high-throughput pipeline to digitise our collection we use new imaging technologies. For example, the SatScan collection scanner takes high-resolution, low-distortion images of collection drawers, spending less than two seconds per specimen. Library and Archives The Library and Archives collections form a unique resource for scientific and historical research. Many items are used alongside Museum specimen collections, but the majority can be used only by visiting the Library because they are unique or very rare. Nearly three million digital images of artworks, books, manuscripts and films have been created for public view by high-throughput digitisation and boutique scanning processes. We have delivered images to initiatives such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) and the cultural heritage portal Europeana, and have contributed unique content to Darwin Online and the Wallace Correspondence Project, which launched in 2013. One example of how digitisation is supporting wider access to rare items is the recent project to produce a new edition of Audubon's Birds of 7 3 million digital images of our artworks, books, manuscripts and films have been created for the publicLeft A drawer of mounted specimens of butterflies and moths. The SatScan collection scanner takes high-resolution, low-distortion images of collection drawers, spending on average as little as two seconds per specimen using high-throughput digitisation America, considered one of the finest ornithological works ever completed. The plates feature life-size images of the birds in realistic poses and scenery, often interacting with other birds or wildlife. Audubon is widely regarded as the greatest bird artist of all time, so making his work available in this way has attracted enormous attention the world over. Our Library is a leading partner in the BHL 2, a consortium of natural history and botanical libraries that co-operate to digitise and make accessible their legacy literature. The BHL consortium works with the international taxonomic community, rights holders, and other interested parties to ensure this heritage is made available through open access principles. We made available a rare, out-of-print title regularly requested by egg curators from around the world through the BHL. The Handbuch der Oologie by M. Sch\u00f6nwetter and W. Meise contains detailed measurements of eggs and is now accessible digitally 3 with the kind permission of W. Meise's family and current rights holder Wiley-VCH. Botanical collections The global community of plant scientists has led the way in large-scale digitisation. We now have more than 130,000 fully digitised botanical items, including full data transcription and high-resolution imaging. The Museum has focused on its most important collections, type material and historical collections, alongside important taxonomic groups. This means we can reach a wider user group than if we had focused on one sole element of the collections. Similarly, by presenting our digital collections via a range of resources we reach a more varied user group than by populating a single online resource. All flowering plant, algal, fern, moss and lichen types will ultimately be digitised. Through international consortia such as the Global Plants Initiative 4, they will be presented alongside material from sister organisations to help realise the goal of facilitating online taxonomy from anywhere in the world. Digitisation fulfils a basic premise of our corporate mission to give access to and increase understanding of the natural world. It also helps safeguard the collections and aid their conservation. The high quality of the images should also reduce the costly demands of meeting (and seeking) many loan requests because the increasing use of online resources will vastly reduce the need to examine actual specimens. Digitisation is an expanding field, with many national organisations now looking at ways of industrialising the digitisation process to make all collections available electronically. The huge advances over recent years, and the experiences gained over the last decade, now make this a potential reality for the Museum.Vladimir Blagoderov, Jane Smith and Steve Cafferty8 eTaxonomy Rapid and pervasive technological change is creating new ways of acquiring, storing, manipulating and transmitting vast amounts of data. It is also stimulating new habits of communication and collaboration among scientists. The Museum is leading a multinational, EU-funded project to develop a sustainable electronic infrastructure that supports these activities for the global biodiversity community. Scratchpads 5 allow users to create, link, analyse and publish taxonomic and biodiversity data on the web, making their work discoverable, accessible and reusable. Advanced tools and analytical functions incentivise data harmonisation and open data licensing while still offering flexibility to support the diverse needs of different research communities. Scratchpads use a framework of data standards to facilitate integration with a network of global biodiversity initiatives including the Encyclopedia of Life project 6 and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility 7. Scratchpads are also piloting the production of data papers through a new Biodiversity Data Journal 8, allowing researchers to gain credit in the production of open and reusable datasets that are well described and annotated. With over 6,400 active users, Scratchpads provide a unified virtual research environment for taxonomists, biodiversity researchers and citizen scientists around the world. Currently 430 research communities use Scratchpads to curate data on over 52,000 taxa. These include 15 Scratchpads on monocotyledon plants developed in association with Kew Gardens and Oxford University as part of the Natural Environment Research Council-funded e-monocot project 9, the Phasmid Study Group10 (with more than 1,600 active users) and Antkey11, an ant identification site with almost 20,000 pages of content on invasive, introduced and commonly intercepted ant species from across the globe. Training and outreach are an important part of the Scratchpads project. In 2012, members of the Scratchpads team ran training courses and gave lectures in 15 countries across five continents. These meetings often result in the formation of international scientific working groups, such as the Eriocaulaceae site 12, which has taxonomic experts from Europe, North America and South America with an interest in this group of flowering plants.Vincent SmithLeft A green winged orchid found in Kent which is a member of the monocotyledon group of plants, a focus of a major eTaxonomy project eTaxonomy will create an integrated, online information resource 9 Right Data providers can feed consistant data into a single pipeline using EMu. Valuable information can then be shared globallyresearch communities use Scratchpads to curate data on over 52,000 taxa430EMu Conference The Natural History Museum hosted the inaugural Worldwide EMu Users Conference in October 2011, to bring together users of the KE EMu information and collections management software package from around the world. More than 300 museums use EMu and attendees from the Australasian, European, Middle Eastern, and North American regions discussed use, needs, and common development goals. The conference showed museums' ability to innovate and evolve. First-iteration tools and protocols were demonstrated at the conference for an initiative called Across the Great Divide, which is led by the Museum. These tools and protocols allow data to be reconciled, displayed and shared among museums using EMu. The test case shared information about Charles Darwin held in EMu in the Smithsonian, Peabody Museum (Yale University), and the Natural History Museum, and proved that the technology works. Additional work on algorithms to reconcile differences among the data sources is underway. Museums using EMu aim, eventually, to hold data in a distributed and more accessible way instead of each institution holding separate, duplicate and sometimes disparate data sets. The information that natural history museums hold and curate in areas such as climate change, biodiversity and evolutionary biology is of worldwide interest. Diverse stakeholders ask institutions for access to information. Discussion at the first Worldwide EMu Users Conference laid the groundwork for an open, common approach to provide access to the combined data resource of all users of EMu. Rather than each institution responding in a unique way to requests, we will pool information and provide access to it through a common, open data structure in line with international data standards. The efficiencies and cost savings for both the data providers and the data consumers will be enormous. Data providers will be able to feed consistent data into a single pipeline rather than many; data consumers will be able to go to a single source instead of dozens.Darrell Siebert10 Challenge 2 Origins, evolution and futures Understanding our changing planet The Earth is entering a period of unprecedented environmental change that threatens the existence of the global systems upon which life depends. One of the great scientific challenges is, therefore, to understand the consequences of this change for natural ecosystems and for those which humans directly exploit in various ways, such as marine, freshwater and agricultural environments. Natural history collections offer a unique opportunity to address this challenge because they document the origin and evolution of the solar system, the Earth and the diversity of living organisms, and the effect of previous periods of change. With our collaborators we are using our collections and our knowledge of deep time to understand the causes, processes and impacts of such changes and to use this knowledge to predict the impact of current and future change. 6 million years of human evolution history is explored by Natural History Museum scientists Left A skull-cup identified among human remains from Gough's Cave, Somerset. At around 14,700 years old, these skull-cups are the oldest directly dated examples in the world 11 Human origins and evolution Natural History Museum research on human origins covers about six million years of the history of hominin evolution but concentrates on the study of the most recent one million years of that time period. We carry out fieldwork in the UK, Europe and North Africa, and collaborate with many other institutions, both in the UK and around the world. We cover several different aspects of human origins and evolution, some examples of which are given below. Human evolution and dispersal The Ancient Human Occupation of Britain (AHOB) project is a large-scale collaboration between palaeontologists, earth scientists and archaeologists to investigate ancient humans in Britain and adjoining regions. The project aims to understand the chronology of human dispersals, how the nature of the occupation of Britain changed through time, and the factors controlling dispersal into marginal environments. Growth and development Museum scientists are studying the evidence of early lifetime experiences preserved in human tooth enamel. The age of onset and duration of enamel formation varies between teeth, so different teeth preserve a record of different stages of life. The health of an individual during development can be inferred from surface enamel defects, which are caused by interruptions in enamel formation and reflect periods of ill health. Human behaviour Bone, teeth and antlers can record signs of human activity, including butchering, engraving, tool manufacture, burial practice and cannibalism. Museum projects employ newly developed technologies for the analysis of surface modifications. Researchers have been excavating the Palaeolithic site of Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt in Morocco in collaboration with colleagues from Oxford University and the Institut National des Sciences de l'Arch\u00e9ologie et du Patrimoine. The 'Cemeteries and Sedentism' project funded by the Leverhulme Trust focuses on changes in human occupation, diet, health and funerary behaviour during the Iberomaurusian period, approximately 20,000 to 10,000 years ago.Anatomical and behavioural adaptations Research led by Markus Bastir and Antonio Rosas of the Spanish Natural Science Museum, and including Museum scientists Chris Stringer and Robert Kruszynski, has shown differences in brain morphology between hominin species. The researchers used computed tomography (CT) scans and virtual reconstructions of fossil skulls to show that the temporal lobes, which correspond to cognition, and the olfactory bulbs, which correspond to the sense of smell, are about 12 per cent larger in Homo sapiens compared with Neanderthals. This suggests that these two areas work together and are more important in the evolution of the modern human than previously recognised; historically, our sense of smell had been thought of as less significant compared with our other senses.Laura Buck, Silvia Bello, Louise Humphrey and Chris Stringer Left Stylised partial figure of a horse in left profile engraved on a reindeer antler from the Magdalenian site of Moulin-sous-Chirel, Neschers (France) 12 Modelling the past: virtual reconstructions of dinosaur walking The first dinosaurs were bipedal animals, walking and running on long, powerful hind legs. This released their hands and forelimbs for other uses, such as food gathering and display. The ability to walk bipedally is a rare evolutionary event, found only in dinosaurs, their descendants the birds, a handful of mammals (most obviously humans) and a few reptiles (such as basilisks). Given the rarity of this phenomenon, the mechanics of walking and running in bipeds, including dinosaurs, has been studied intensively. However, some dinosaurs gave up bipedality in favour of life on all fours, reverting to the quadrupedal condition characterising the vast majority of land-living vertebrates. The reasons for this are unclear - why should animals that have been through the rare transition to bipedality give it up? A recently completed, three-year Natural Environment Research Council-funded project based at the Museum has been attempting to answer this question. This project, led by Museum scientists Paul Barrett and Susannah Maidment, was carried out in collaboration with palaeontological colleagues from the Royal Tyrrell Museum, Canada and biomechanical collaborators from the University of Manchester. We applied computational techniques borrowed from the world of medicine and zoology to the skeletons of bipedal and quadrupedal dinosaurs, concentrating on those from the ornithischian dinosaur group. Ornithischia, or bird-hipped dinosaurs, includes animals like Stegosaurus, Triceratops and Iguanodon. The earliest ornithischians, and many of their descendants, were bipeds, but the ability to walk on all fours reappeared on at least three separate occasions in the group, in duck-billed (hadrosaur), horned (ceratopsian) and armoured (thyreophoran) dinosaurs. After examining hundreds of bones, and dissecting birds and crocodiles, we were able to reconstruct their leg musculatures. Computational techniques were then applied to their skeletons and muscles, allowing us to calculate their centre of mass and body volumes, and deduce the ways in which the different muscles acting on the hips and hind limbs acted during walking.We found major differences in the attachment points, sizes and functions of the muscles in the legs of quadrupeds and bipeds. Plotting these features on to evolutionary trees showed that features associated with quadrupedality were acquired in different ways in each of the three major groups that adopted this stance. This showed that the evolution of these features was not constrained by their original bipedal adaptations. In addition, we were able to show the centre of body mass in ceratopsians moved forwards in comparison with their bipedal ancestors, due to their enormously heavy frilled heads. It seems that increased head size actually helped drive quadrupedality in this group. In hadrosaurs and thyreophorans it seems most likely that the need for a capacious gut for digesting tough plant food might have been the driving force behind the loss of bipedality, as longer guts need longer trunks to house them, which affects the position of the centre of mass and thereby their walking style.Paul Barrett Below Triceratops are part of the Ornithischia group, the bird-hipped group of dinosaurs studied 13London protocol for climate change Understanding the impact of climate change on the biosphere is one of the most pressing problems of our time. Natural history collections provide a unique and valuable resource for exploring these effects, but one that until now has been very little exploited. The Natural History Museum is taking a lead in this respect. In 2010 we undertook a comprehensive survey of our collections, identifying case studies where the available material had significant potential for climate-change research. This survey drew up a 'long list' of suitable collections, then by working in the collections we could identify a 'short list' of the most promising candidates for research. Several of these projects are currently being pursued at the Museum. This process of identifying and exploiting collections suitable for research has been promoted at meetings among the world's leading scientific collection organisations, where delegates named it the 'London protocol'. The value of natural history collections for exploring the effects of climate change resides principally in their coverage of the Earth's biota across large areas and back through the time of acquisition of the material - typically into the nineteenth century and beyond. They therefore span the period of major human impact on the biosphere by industrialisation, human population growth and, latterly, climate warming. Above Scientists are studying the genetic structure in whale populations over the last 200 years The work involves close collaboration between curatorial and research staff, because data associated with collections often have to be collated, and collections curated and/or databased before the research can commence. This collections development, which may extend to new collecting to give a 'present-day' snapshot of the species for comparison with older material, is a valuable by-product of the work.Our recent and current initiatives in this area include: A new database of the Museum's and other British collections suitable for investigating the effects of ocean acidification on shelly marine organisms Research into changes in seasonal timing in orchid flowering and insect emergence in the UK Using fossil collections to examine the effects on marine organisms of a past analogue of global warming - the 'Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum' some 60 million years ago Studying changes in the genetic structure of whale populations over the past 200 years. Adrian Lister the London protocol shows the importance of natural history collectionsClimate change: By collating and analysing data associated with Museum specimens, plus new analysis of the specimens themselves, we can: Map changes in the distribution of species through time, such as range contraction through human impacts on habitats, or poleward or altitudinal shifts due to global warming Track shifts in the seasonal timing of biological events: for example, earlier flowering or insect emergence with climate warming Examine the genetic effects of these processes: for example, has the genetic diversity within a species become reduced as its range has contracted? Measure the effects on the organism itself: for example, has ocean acidification affected the survival of marine species that build their shells from calcium carbonate?14 Challenge 3 Biodiversity discovery Mapping the world we know - and exploring the world we don't At least 75 per cent of life remains to be discovered. Based on the current rate of discovery with established techniques, that task may take more than 500 years to complete. We need to develop new approaches to the discovery of biological diversity and to apply this information to the understanding and preservation of natural and artificial ecosystems. Natural history museums are well placed to lead on this, given their expertise in taxonomy, systematics and understanding natural diversity. We have been working on new technologies to support this goal, including molecular approaches, web-based taxonomy, informatics and citizen science. We plan to develop this strength to enhance international collaboration and leadership on new approaches to taxonomy. This will form a modern tool kit for biodiversity discovery both in the UK and in mega-diverse systems such as tropical forests, deep oceans and microbial communities. Turbo taxonomy Taxonomy and the development of natural history collections have been the foundation for studying species diversity on Earth, but estimates predict that 75 per cent or more of diversity still remains unknown. This lack of knowledge of biological diversity on Earth hampers progress in understanding extinction, evolution and ecological organisation. Advances in genomic analysis can greatly improve the rate of species description and identification. The idea of building a DNA-based system for species delineation and identification arose in the early 2000s and has now been widely applied. The most notable success is 'DNA barcoding', a standardised library of gene fragments for most animal and plant species. This provides exciting opportunities for studying biodiversity in the twenty-first century. A major challenge for the environmental sciences is the study of complex ecosystems, such as those in the tropics, especially if studies involve small-bodied or 'cryptic' species (species that can only be separated by differences in DNA). The great species numbers and ecological diversity make these ecosystems important for ecosystem services, biogeochemical cycles and climate change. Large-scale DNA sequencing can address this challenge. Our scientists demonstrated this possibility initially with a study of poorly known insect communities in Madagascar. To capture the insect diversity of the island, an expedition sampled a set of indicator groups, including butterflies, dung beetles and termites to represent terrestrial ecosystems, while water beetles and mayflies exemplified aquatic habitats. When specimens were assessed for both DNA and morphological differences there was little discrepancy: among 348 species, 8.3 per cent were split by the genetic tests, whereas only 2 per cent of morphologically recognised species were not separable by DNA data. This shows the power of DNA methods in taxonomy. Very recently, the use of nanotechnology has resulted in a quantum leap in DNA sequencing. This technology can be extended to address questions in taxonomy and biodiversity, generating data on literally billions of nucleotides in a single day. The high throughput makes it suitable for sequencing numerous genes and multiple individuals, making it very useful for the analysis of complex taxonomic problems. For example, standard trapping of invertebrates produces thousands of specimens preserved in alcohol. This 'biodiversity soup' requires careful sorting and identification of specimens before it is useful for addressing specific questions about biodiversity or ecology. This process is very time-consuming and requires the expertise of taxonomists, of which there are fewer available. Researchers at the Natural History Museum are now developing molecular methods that can identify all specimens in a large pool of samples. Eventually, this procedure will circumvent the 'taxonomic impediment' of a lack of taxonomists that has been holding back the study of biodiversity. Future approaches will use DNA data to model the magnitude and distribution of species diversity and make inferences about the causes of diversification.Alfried Vogler 15 is used by Museum scientists to develop rapid tools to describe biodiversityGenomic analysisBelow Polybothris goryi (Gu\u00e9rin-M\u00e9neville,1833), a jewel beetle from Helena Maratheftis16 Right Filoreta marina Bass and Cavalier-Smith is a rhizarian network-forming amoeba from marine sediments. The cell bodies are c. 10-50 microns across. Thin cytoplasmic strands link cell bodies together in networks that cover many square centimetres Microbial diversity Not all microorganisms are bacteria and viruses: some are eukaryotes - the same group of organisms that contain most of the more familiar fungi, plants and animals (including ourselves). The world of microbial eukaryotes is incredibly diverse and underpins many of the ecosystem processes that the rest of life depends on. However, only a tiny proportion of these eukaryotes have been seen and described, and an even smaller proportion has been cultured so they can be studied in more detail. Molecular biology techniques offer a range of ways that these organisms can be detected and understood. As an example of this, in a recent study published in Nature we confirmed the existence of a very diverse group of microbes commonly found in freshwater and marine habitats that are closely related to fungi. The existence of these single-celled eukaryotes, which we refer to as Cryptomycota, was originally indicated by DNA sequences generated by several eukaryote-wide surveys of a wide range of habitats. We designed more specific molecular probes to members of this large group that allowed us to pinpoint where they are found (very often in freshwater lakes and ponds). We designed other molecular probes tagged with fluorescent labels that specifically bind to Cryptomycota cells. These labels are visible when excited by particular wavelengths of light in a microscopy technique called fluorescent in situ hybridisation. This technique allowed us to see cells that were tiny, approximately five thousandths of a millimetre in diameter, and that existed in several forms - resting stages, cells attached to other organisms (feeding), and zoospores with a single flagellum that allows them to swim through their aquatic environment. Interestingly, none of the cells we observed had a cell wall containing chitin, which is thought to be one of the key evolutionary innovations of the fungi, enabling later-evolving fungi to live in diverse habitats and feed by extracellular digestion followed by nutrient uptake. Our finding suggests that Cryptomycota represent a very early branch of the fungal tree of life, and the diversity and distribution of these microbes tell us that this 'intermediate form' is hugely successful in ecological and evolutionary terms. Further study of these enigmatic organisms will tell us a lot about how fungi also evolved into the highly successful group that they are today.David Bass 17 Left The AMC holds collections of UK biodiversity and fossils to help with enquiries from the publicinvertebrates counted using the OPAL app800,000UK biodiversity and citizen science UK biodiversity faces many pressures, from urban expansion to the introduction of non-native species and the impacts of changing weather patterns and climate. The Museum has provided science to understand and document this biodiversity for decades, in the form of taxonomy and identification tools, together with collections that provide archive evidence for changing patterns of distribution. In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the personally enriching and scientifically valuable role that increased public involvement can play in helping to track changes in UK flora and fauna. This has given an added dimension and increased capability to our work. The Museum combines broad collaborative science and public outreach and is an ideal focus for innovation and exploration in the field of citizen science - the involvement of volunteers in the process of science research. The Museum's Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity (AMC) 13 co-ordinates an innovative UK citizen science programme. This ranges from BioBlitzes - comprehensive surveys of a location's biodiversity that simultaneously engage professional and amateur scientists and members of the public - to mass engagement surveys that investigate species of interest on a country-wide scale. As well as generating valuable data on UK biodiversity, the programme directly engages participants with biodiversity and science relevant to their lives. In doing so it helps to translate major global concerns into tangible local issues in a way that fosters ongoing environmental stewardship. With NERC-CEH (Natural Environment Research Council-Centre for Ecology and Hydrology), John Tweddle and Lucy Robinson (AMC) completed a major review and assessment of 230 citizen science projects, including interviews with scientific data users and policy makers. The review makes recommendations on the future of citizen science in the UK, including its potential to deliver environment and biodiversity monitoring targets. A knowledge transfer guide was produced to support practitioners in developing, implementing and evaluating projects to study biodiversity and the environment in the UK 14. The AMC team, in partnership with eight UK natural history societies and four universities, launched the Open Air Laboratories network (OPAL) Bugs Count citizen science survey in June 2011. The survey investigated how urbanisation affects the abundance and distribution of terrestrial invertebrates. It encouraged members of the public to document habitat availability and then identify, photograph and report a range of native and recently arrived species. The survey is supported by identification resources, an interactive website 15 and the Museum's first mobile app. Uptake was fantastic. 30,000 copies of the survey pack were distributed, almost 20,000 people participated, more than 800,000 individual invertebrates were counted and data for over 5,000 survey sites entered online. The breadth of participation reflects both public interest and the accessibility and value of the survey resources. Data analysis began in summer 2012 and initial results give a clearer picture of changing species distributions within the UK and of the value of the built environment for terrestrial invertebrates.John Tweddle and Lucy Robinson18 Challenge 4 Natural resources and hazards Applying our expertise to tackle society's challenges The global human population is predicted to reach 10 billion within the next 50 years, a five-fold increase in the space of a century. This population explosion poses a series of major problems: increasing demand for food, emergence of new diseases and patterns of disease, and depletion of the scarce elements upon which new technology is based. The Natural History Museum's unique scientific expertise in taxonomy, systematics and mineralogy allows us to address these problems in novel ways. We can explore new sources of food by identifying the wild relatives of crop plants that will thrive in changing environments, advise on the importance of pollinators, understand invasive species, predict the emergence and spread of diseases, and find new ways to discover and extract scarce minerals in a sustainable way. The first step in realising these goals is to work with our collaborators to develop new scientific approaches and tools that will secure future supplies of food and scarce mineral resources and help identify neglected and emerging diseases. people infected by urogenital schistosomiasis: our scientists are leading an elimination programme in Zanzibar1 12 million 19 Left 'Kichocho day', a fun educational event held at schools in Zanzibar to educate children on how to control Kichocho - a local Swahili name for schistosomiasis Right Mwanza, National Institute for Medical Research, one of our international collaborators in the fight against neglected tropical diseases Parasites, disease and health Neglected tropical diseases Some of the most devastating neglected tropical diseases are caused by parasitic worms, which live and reproduce in the human body. Such diseases include schistosomiasis, elephantiasis and river blindness. They have a major impact on the health and well-being of some of the poorest populations in the developing world.The long evolutionary history of parasitic worms makes them uniquely adapted to develop and survive in the challenging environment of the human body. Many have complex lifecycles, often involving a biting insect or a snail, to ensure the transmission of the parasite from one person to another. Our scientists, backed by good molecular laboratories, are well placed to investigate the biology of parasitic worms and to translate their findings into new solutions for control. Throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, one particular parasitic worm, Schistosoma haematobium, causes a disease known as urogenital schistosomiasis, which may currently infect more than 112 million people. The adult stage of the worm lives in blood vessels around the bladder and one of the most common features of the disease is blood in urine caused by parasite eggs passing through the bladder wall. Schistosomiasis is particularly prevalent among children. In many African villages the symptoms may often go untreated but infection causes much discomfort, blood loss and anaemia. Later in life, infection can be linked to bladder cancer, kidney failure, HIV infection and death. Fortunately, much can be done to control this disease using the drug praziquantel and our scientists are leading an elimination programme for schistosomiasis on the islands of Zanzibar. Working with the Ministry of Health and an international consortium of research scientists, we are investigating new ways to control the disease. Only one safe drug is available for treatment of urogenital schistosomiasis so it is imperative to look for alternative means of control. Exciting opportunities have arisen due to new molecular techniques that allow the full documentation of an animal's genome. The Museum has been part of an international consortium, led by the University of Melbourne, Australia, to produce the first detailed description of the genome of this important parasite, which was recently published in Nature Genetics. As the worms are quite tiny, a new genome amplification approach was used to provide sufficient DNA to sequence the whole of the nuclear genome from a single pair of worms. This remarkable advance gives a new insight into the genetic mechanisms behind the functioning of the parasite. It allows differences from other closely related parasites to be identified that might help to explain many of the key biological questions surrounding the development and reproduction of these formidable human pathogens. Most importantly, knowledge of the genome sequence provides insights and possibilities for the design of new effective drugs. The Parasites and Vectors division in Life Sciences has been re-designated as a World Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Centre until December 2016, in recognition of the importance of their work and expertise on Schistosoma species. The re-designation of the Museum as a WHO collaborating centre recognises the important role played by our scientists and is an example of how we can contribute to global problems impacting on health and well-being.David Rollinson 20 Emerging diseases Emerging diseases are novel parasitic diseases, either appearing in a population for the first time or having existed previously but rapidly increasing in incidence, geographic range or severity. Although emerging human diseases have taken centre stage (for example, SARS and West Nile virus), emerging diseases of other organisms may be of equally great concern if they affect human well-being, for example, in terms of food security. Beth Okamura, the research group and both UK and international collaborators, have been conducting research on the drivers of a devastating emerging disease of salmon and trout, called proliferative kidney disease (PKD). PKD is caused by the myxozoan endoparasite, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, and is increasing in severity and in geographic range in Europe and North America. The disease is highly problematic for fish farms and hatcheries, where up to 100 per cent of stock can be infected and mortalities can reach 95 per cent. There is growing evidence that PKD also substantially contributes to declines in wild salmonid populations, with implications for the conservation of salmonid fishes. Since all salmonids are susceptible, PKD may imperil some of the most iconic of freshwater fish. Our research on PKD began with the ground-breaking discovery that freshwater bryozoans represent the long-sought source of the disease. Like many parasites, T. bryosalmonae has a complex life cycle, in this case involving obligatory development in freshwater bryozoans prior to development in fish. Bryozoans are widespread but poorly known invertebrates that form spreading colonies on surfaces in both running and still water habitats. The discovery of bryozoan hosts has opened up new research avenues to gain a better understanding of disease ecology and why PKD has joined the list of emerging fish diseases. Using a combination of field and laboratory studies, we have made strong links between the emergence of PKD and environmental change (global warming or eutrophication). Host-parasite interactions are of interest with T. bryosalmonae showing a tendency to be a prudent parasite, remaining as 'silent infections' when bryozoan hosts are stressed. Further areas of investigation are using environmental sampling to assess the risk of potential emerging diseases caused by other myxozoans and by parasitic protozoans. We are exploring the diversity, ecology and life cycles of myxozoan parasites of bryozoans and at present we know of four species, two of which are linked with fish hosts. We are now aiming to develop molecular tools to screen for emerging diseases and provide a reference collection.Beth Okamura Above Salmon. Emerging fish diseases have the potential to wipe out 95 per cent of stock in fish farms 21 Viruses, mosquitoes and diagnostic tools We are developing diagnostics for viruses and for mosquito vectors of emerging and re-emerging viral disease. Research, in collaboration with the Unit for Emerging Viruses in Marseille, comprises development of novel, high-throughput cell-culture techniques for viruses and integrated morphological and molecular diagnostic tools for mosquitoes, capable of isolating and fully characterising viruses from individually identified mosquitoes. Fieldwork in Uganda, Thailand, Vietnam and France provided endemic mosquitoes for the integrated study of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, which include dengue fever, yellow fever and West Nile viruses among others. Mosquito diagnostics Fieldwork involves two stages. Firstly, mosquitoes are collected from a range of ecosystems to maximise species diversity. Larvae, pupae and adults are collected using various methods. Immature stages are reared to obtain adults with associated larval and pupal exuviae to serve as taxonomic vouchers. The correlated life stages are thoroughly studied, along with dissected male genitalia, to ensure accurate identification to species. This is critical because the majority of mosquito species that transmit viruses are only reliably identified by characteristics of the male genitalia and/or larval stage. A leg of each mosquito is used to obtain genetic sequence data. Integrating the morphological and molecular data for at least five mosquitoes of each species provides a backbone phylogeny that is used, together with the voucher specimens, as an essential and unique foundation for flavivirus surveillance. Viral diagnostics Secondly, mosquitoes are frozen at -80\u00b0C immediately after capture, identified over dry ice and homogenised individually. Samples are screened using molecular protocols capable of detecting known and novel flaviviruses and also screened by culture in mosquito cell lines to isolate and characterise any viruses present. DNA is extracted from all viral-positive samples and sequenced from the corresponding mosquito homogenate. The sequence is included in the backbone phylogeny to provide failsafe identification of the mosquito that harboured the virus. This provides an unparalleled diagnostic tool for identifying both virus and vector. Our work has several unique aspects. Firstly, viral-positive samples are retrospectively identified back to individual mosquitoes that have associated global positioning system, ecological and temporal data. Viruses are tracked at an exceptionally high resolution of detail from the field to the test tube using automated protocols. Our protocol is the first to use mosquito cell-culture techniques compatible with high-throughput analytical techniques. Until now, cell-culture techniques in mosquito cell lines for viral surveillance have only been possible using large volume flasks and screening of pooled mosquitoes, which has significant room for error. Overall, our work provides information about emerging and re-emerging viruses and their vectors at a completely new level of resolution and accuracy.Shelley Cook and Ralph HarbachBelow Mosquitoes are collected from a range of ecosystems to maximise species diversity mosquito species are currently known: our scientists are developing tools to assist in the identification of vectors3,527 Below Electron micrographs of cultured mosquito cells infected with the Nakiwogo virus, discovered during integrated studies in Uganda22 Food security and agricultural ecosystems Wild relatives of crops Human beings depend upon fewer than a dozen species of flowering plants for 80 per cent of their calorific intake. The genetic diversity in these few species has been drastically reduced during the domestication process because early farmers selected only a relatively narrow range of the diversity available in the wild populations from which the crops were derived. This has led to 'domestication bottlenecks', where crop genetic diversity is very limited and lacks the variation necessary to evolve resistance to pests and diseases. On the other side of the 'domestication bottleneck' are the wild relatives of crop plants, so-called crop wild relatives (CWR). Natural History Museum science is focused on these wild relatives. By understanding the species identity of those plant species related to crops - and their evolutionary relationships - our science can directly contribute to helping plant breeders' efforts in crop improvement. CWR are becoming the focus for breeding efforts aimed at improving crops in the face of climate change and the increasing human population. Because we are using most of the land suitable for agriculture, the main hope for boosting agricultural production lies in improving the crop plants themselves. Crops with higher yields, more resistant to drought or salinity, and resilient to extreme weather, pests and diseases will all be needed in the years to come. Developing these crops depends on access to the broad base of genetic diversity found in CWR. Together with the Global Crop Diversity Trust, our scientists are using knowledge of the distribution of wild relatives of crops in the Solanaceae or nightshade family to look at priorities for collection of CWR for use in plant breeding. Using a monograph on the species-level taxonomy of the tomatoes published in 2008, plus thousands of records of localities from herbarium specimens, they examined the distributions of all the 17 wild species as compared with collections held in germplasm banks around the world. All wild species of tomatoes are from South America, and many species grow in very arid environments and will contain useful genetic variation for drought resistance. They did the same for the Old World crop the aubergine, or brinjal eggplant (Solanum melongena), whose wild relatives occur mostly in Africa. This work was underpinned by another species-level monographic treatment of all the prickly Solanum in Africa - the first for over a century. New understanding of the identity of the eggplant wild relatives from Africa and their interrelationships will allow plant breeders and their seed collectors to target populations where traits of interest might exist. Eggplants belong to the largest division of Solanum, the subgenus Leptostemonum, which has more than 400 species. It is a challenge to figure out just which of those 400 species are the close relatives of the crop. Here is where the Museum's research helps. Our studies on the identity and relationships of CWR, and the accurate information derived from the collections on where these species grow, are all essential for focusing subsequent action. Without an in-depth taxonomic context, the extensive genetic diversity in CWR that could be useful to crop improvement could remain an untapped reservoir.Sandra Knapp Above Collecting examples of wild potatoes in Argentina, which grow in very arid environments, useful for investigating drought resistance Right Museum research is helping to identify which types of wild growing Solanum (eggplants) have benefits that breeders could use to improve their crops of human calories come from 12 plant species: our scientists' research directly contributes to crop improvements80 per cent 23 Pollination: which commercial bumblebee? Food security depends on pollination. Many tree fruits, berries, and greenhouse crops such as tomatoes depend on commercially-reared bumblebees for pollination, an industry worth billions of pounds annually. One of the largest and fastest growing markets for these crops is in China, where the national government is looking for growth in productivity, especially in North China and in particular from greenhouse crops. One European bumblebee species (Bombus terrestris) has performed well at commercial pollination in greenhouses. Unfortunately, translocation from Europe has led to the introduction and invasion of the exotic B. terrestris and its pathogens into New Zealand, Tasmania, South America and Japan. In Japan and South America in particular it is causing sharp declines in the local bee species. The use of local species is likely to be less damaging, both in terms of competition and the introduction of novel diseases. If local species are to be used effectively in this way, good identification tools are essential: different species can have different strategies and preferences for pollination. In addition, the tendency of horticulturalists to move colonies to different locations could have unexpected ecological consequences if there is not accurate knowledge of which species is being used. However, clarifying the taxonomy of this particular group of bumblebee species has proved difficult even for European species. Recently there have been claims that each of three western European species have both characteristic colour patterns of the hair and characteristic DNA 'barcode' sequences. However, other larger studies have shown that the colour-pattern groups and the DNA groups frequently disagree - these bees have truly cryptic species that are impossible to separate by physical characteristics. The Natural History Museum has led a collaborative study by 18 scientists from 12 countries of the DNA barcodes and Bayesian models to disentangle 17 cryptic species of this bumblebee group from all over the world. This has allowed us for the first time to identify the species throughout their ranges and to map these ranges worldwide. Among the results in North China, for example, we found that orange-tailed bumblebees are actually part of the widespread Russian but otherwise white-tailed species B. patagiatus, whereas the similar orange-tailed bees in Japan, previously considered to be of the same species as the North China bees, prove to be a separate species - B. hypocrita.This result has important commercial and ecological implications, because both B. patagiatus and B. hypocrita have been used for pollination in greenhouses. As demand for pollination services by greenhouse growers inevitably increases, these bees are more likely to be transported between countries. Our research shows that any future transport of B. patagiatus from China into Japan, or of B. hypocrita from Japan into China, would be inadvisable. Trials of the locally indigenous species are now in progress in China. The accurate identification of bees being bred and translocated for commercial pollination is crucial to avoid the possible extinction of other bee species. This research has an obvious value in terms of biodiversity conservation and an additional value in terms of avoiding potential risks to important pollinators of valuable foods.Paul Williams Right Examples of the bumblebee subgenus Bombus s.(top row left to right): worker, Sweden; queen, Turkey; queen, China and queen, Denmark,(bottom left to right): queen, India; Vogt queen, Denmark; Bischoff male, China and queen, Denmark24 Pest control: searching for new natural enemies for control of invasive pests Over several decades there has been an increasing recognition and acceptance that the emission of environmentally damaging pesticides into the environment must be reduced. A very effective and sustainable alternative to the use of insecticides is the release of insect natural enemies for pest control. These are most commonly parasitoid wasps - species that develop in or on the bodies of other insects, mites or spiders. Parasitoids tend to be relatively host-specific, able to develop only on a narrow range of host species, which makes them ideal biological control agents. For example, one of the most common biological control agents, the wasp Encarsia formosa, has been used in greenhouses for whitefly control for 90 years, and has only ever been reared from 15 whitefly species, all of which are relatively closely related. Probably the most successful biological control agent of all time, Anagyrus lopezi - responsible for saving thousands of millions of pounds for African agriculture - is known only from its target pest, the cassava mealybug (Phenacoccus manihoti) and two very closely related species in the same genus. Parasitoid researchers at the Museum are international experts in the study of economically important species which have been used successfully in biological control programmes around the world. These have been especially effective when they concern invasive pest species, for example, the cassava mealybug discussed above. Tuta absoluta is a moth of South American origin which is currently the most serious pest of tomatoes in Europe and which is spreading east into Asia. It has had a devastating effect on tomato production in Europe over the past few years, especially in Italy and Spain. We have discovered and identified five species of Trichogramma wasps that destroy the eggs of Tuta absoluta. This was achieved in collaboration with a Spanish team of researchers based in the Canary Islands, and later involving USA-based specialists on DNA characterisation of insect species and populations. All five species were collected in the Canary Islands, where before this study no Trichogramma species was known. Identification was initially carried out using the physical morphological characteristics of the adult wasps, and later confirmed by DNA sequencing. The team has since developed a rapid and inexpensive method for identifying the Trichogramma species known from Tuta absoluta. The most commonly detected species in the study is now being mass-reared in Spain and used successfully for the biocontrol of Tuta absoluta and other pest moth species.Andrew Polaszek Above Trichogramma wasps destroy the eggs of Tuta absoluta, a moth that is currently the most serious pest of tomatoes in Europe Below Sample of DNA sequences of 16 specimens (or individuals), representing six species, of Trichogramma wasps, including five previously unknown from the Canary Islands, one of which is a completely new species 25 Mineral exploration The Altaids story The mountains and surrounding areas of Central Asia, or Altaids, that cross parts of Russia, Kazakhstan, the Central Asian states, China, Mongolia and Afghanistan, contain a large number of world-class precious and base metal deposits. How these ores formed is very poorly understood. This vast, largely under-explored, region has the potential to become one of the most important sources of metals of the twenty-first century. The Ores research team is working to discover how episodes of ore formation and tectonic activity that created the Altaids are related and how these contribute to the geological history of the region. This research provides a framework for mineral exploration and important insights into the processes that form ores. It is led by Reimar Seltmann and builds on contacts made through the Museum's Centre for Russian and Central EurAsian Mineral Studies (CERCAMS). A series of 1,000-kilometre transects across the region and subsequent laboratory studies were supported by \u00a31 million from a consortium of major mining companies, including Rio Tinto, Anglo-American, BHP-Billiton, Vale, Newmont, Gold Fields and Ivanhoe Mines Mongolia. Local collaborators and associated research partners from the CERCAMS network around the world made in-kind contributions to the project. One of the key findings of the research is that the conventional exploration approach can be improved. Traditionally tectonic terranes, magmatic arcs (where volcanism and other magmatic activity has occurred) and belts of ores are correlated and extrapolated in space and time. The research showed that this approach can be improved by considering interactions between the Earth's crust and mantle and the key role of shear zones that dissect the Earth's lithosphere and control the location of most of the giant ore deposits.The ongoing research, now under the umbrella of a UNESCO-funded International Union of Geological Sciences' project, involves 30 teams from Central Asian states, China, Mongolia, Russia, Australia, Canada and the EU. It has resulted in a series of important publications, including a new regional synthesis. From this, a geographic information system platform is playing a pivotal role both as a generic database for mineral exploration and as a strategic information source for research. This has been used by the United States Geological Survey to delineate prospective target areas in their Global Mineral Resource Assessment Program.Reimar Seltmann Above Kumtor gold mine (Kyrgyz Tienshan) in summer26 Left An example of pentlandite, which comprises iron nickel sulphide New sources of nickel Nickel is a key component of many alloys, magnets and rechargeable batteries. Finding and extracting nickel-bearing deposits is therefore of great commercial importance. Laterites are deep soils formed by extensive weathering under hot, wet tropical conditions. Nickel laterites form where these soils develop on ultrabasic rocks that are rich in nickel sulphides. We have been working on the geology of nickel laterites with the Universities of Southampton and Loughborough and C \u00b8alda g Nikel, a mining company based in Turkey. This collaboration has resulted in the publication of new ideas on the geological evolution of lateritisation and how it relates to the formation of economic nickel deposits in the Mediterranean region in the last 70 million years. This work has more clearly defined the favourable climate periods when such deposits formed and therefore better defined the packages of rocks that can be explored to find these economic resources. The results of the research have been published in three peer-reviewed papers, including one in Geology, which links climatic changes to the formation of nickel laterite deposits.Parallel work on understanding the detailed mineralogy of nickel laterite deposits is being used to help develop improved processes for extracting nickel, particularly the hydrometallurgical methods of processing. The work has focused on understanding the fundamental mineralogical controls on nickel incorporation in a range of mineral groups (mainly layered silicates and oxides). There have been two main strands to the work. Firstly, to understand fundamentally how iron oxy-hydroxides and layer silicates accommodate nickel in their lattices. The second strand is to investigate the dissolution and nickel liberation mechanisms during hydrometallurgical leaching test work. Specimens from the collections are used extensively as natural standard material for comparison work with ore material and experimentally synthesised products.Volcanic origins of ores The most significant way that continental crust has grown on the 'modern' Earth over the last billion years is through the collision of island arcs with continents and thus the addition of material to the continents. The arcs have formed through volcanic activity above zones where tectonic plates are active. So when arcs and continents collide the resulting collision zones are rich in ore deposits and contain some of the world's major mineral deposits. We have been working on the processes of mineral deposit formation in arc-continent collision belts with a series of international collaborators. The work has resulted in extensive collections of material from mineral deposits and associated host rocks from modern and ancient arc-continent settings. The project has focused on mineralised belts spanning a range of geological epochs from the Palaeozoic Urals of Russia and Caledonides of Ireland to the recent Banda arc in Indonesia. It has documented the key processes leading to the formation and preservation of deposits in these areas. In the future we will use these new models to predict the occurrence of ore deposits.Richard HerringtonBelow Ore deposits form in volcanic activity above subduction (when one tectonic plate moves under another and sinks into the mantle) 2728 Challenge 5 Science, society and skills New ways of engaging with the world around us The Natural History Museum has been developing new ways to engage society in both contemporary scientific debates and the processes of scientific discovery. To do this we have been building on our existing expertise in citizen science, online blogging, and large-scale public science events in the Museum and elsewhere in the UK. Our national and international profile provides us with a unique opportunity to inspire the next generation of scientists. We can equip them with the skills required to understand natural diversity and engage with society. Together with museums, universities and other partners we have developed a portfolio of training programmes in science, curation and public engagement. These courses integrate training in the traditional skills that underlie our core disciplines with the new digital and molecular technologies that are revolutionising our field. Lyme Regis Fossil Festival The Natural History Museum was a lead partner at the annual Lyme Regis Fossil Festival in May 2012, as it has been since the festival began in 2005. The festival is the largest for Earth Sciences in the UK, attracting about 17,000 visitors over two days of the May Bank Holiday weekend. It included dedicated events for 900 students from secondary and primary schools over the two preceding days. Lyme Regis sits near the centre of the 'Jurassic Coast', England's only natural UNESCO world heritage site, with which the Museum is partnered. It is an ideal location for a fossil festival, having been key to the development of palaeontology and the understanding of fossil evolution since the early nineteenth century. Today its rapidly eroding coastline provides fossils that can be collected on the beach and may be of scientific importance or excite interest in the Earth's history among young and old alike.Thirty-six Museum staff, including scientists, scientific associates, educators and volunteers, used specimens and activities to talk about life through geological time: from the earliest periods of the solar system, through the times represented by the rocks of the Jurassic Coast, to what is living in Lyme Bay today using a remotely operated submarine vehicle. A team of palaeontologists ran a stand for identifying fossils fresh from the beach and scientists from the Museum's Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity answered questions about living animals and plants. The secondary schools' day was the first to be held at a festival and took place at the Thomas Hardye School, Dorchester, which provided a convenient venue for all local schools. The activities there were tailored for a secondary school audience, for instance including an activity on copper ores and processing. The day closed with a Caf\u00e9 Scientifique evening by the Museum's Chris Stringer on 'The origin of our species'. The following day was tailored for primary schools at Lyme Regis where students were able to learn about minerals through a hands-on 'gold' panning exercise and indulge in messy extractions of DNA of 'fruit and vegetables'. Broadcasts from Lyme Regis back to the Museum linked visitors in South Kensington to the festival and we are now using the festival as a model for our national programme of engagement.Andy Fleet 29 visitors attended the Lyme Regis Fossil Festival in May 2012, engaging with 36 Museum staff17 ,000 Above Museum scientist engaging with children \u00a9 Lyme Regis Fossil Festival Below The Museum's wallchart book Life on Earth, which traces the evolution of life on Earth, was printed onto a ten-metre screen to create an exciting backdrop for visitors30 V Factor V Factor is the Museum's unique volunteer initiative that runs in the Darwin Centre's scientific laboratories which are open to viewing by the public. Teams of volunteers become part of the Museum exhibits as they work side-by-side with scientists to collect data for research. The initiative brings citizen science alive through volunteering and provides a framework for our scientists to undertake collections-based projects through engaging volunteers. It is designed to be mutually beneficial and it works. This year we collaborated with the Throughflow Marie Curie Initial Training Network. The Throughflow team has recently returned from two large-scale field expeditions to Borneo with several tonnes of fossils required to reveal the origins of incredible diversity of reef life living in the 'Coral Triangle' of southeast Asia.We wanted to reach new volunteers who had not necessarily made a long-term commitment to the Museum or started a career in natural history. V Factor is about real research experience: during ten-week sessions, volunteers learned about collections care and worked with scientists to learn how fossils are used to solve scientific questions. We challenged them to consider the broader significance of natural history collections as records of life on Earth. Thanks to the hard work of our project and volunteer team a grand total of 1,000 samples has been processed - a volume that would have taken years without their involvement. V Factor greatly increased the value of new fossil collections for scientific research, while giving volunteers a unique learning experience. The value of the work and volunteer commitment in the project is priceless.Ken Johnson Above V Factor volunteers working in the public laboratories within the Darwin CentreLeft V Factor volunteers after completing the programme and receiving their certificates for their work on tropical fossil corals 31 Public outreach and citizen science In addition to involving volunteers in scientific research, citizen science is an essential tool for broadening public awareness of environmental issues. It can communicate the fascination and value of the natural world, develop participants' skills and give people a tangible, personal experience of biodiversity. The Museum's Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity (AMC) 16 leads on a variety of engagement activities, ranging from production of identification tools to workshops, NGO networking and collaboration, public surveys and mass participation events. Visitors to the Museum can contribute to the process of biodiversity discovery in addition to satisfying their own curiosity. Recent items brought in to our Identification and Advisory Service team include the first two UK records of the large and charismatic false wolf spider, Zoropsis spinimana. Native to warmer regions of continental Europe, 'people power' has shown that the species is now established within London.In May 2012, the AMC helped to design and deliver a fantastically successful Big Nature Day at South Kensington. Over 5,000 Museum visitors took part in activities that explored the wealth and beauty of UK biodiversity and celebrated the achievements of the OPAL project. A key element was the opportunity to meet and interact with members of the UK's naturalist community. Over 50 UK natural history societies and external organisations shared their expertise and enthusiasm by presenting stands and running nature-themed activities in the Museum's Darwin Centre and gardens.John Tweddle, Stuart Hine and Lucy Robinson Museum visitors took part in Big Nature Day activities5,000Right The Museum leads on a range of citizen science projects including public surveys and mass participation events32 Next generation sequencing CT scanner The Natural History Museum is recognised as one of the world's leading authorities in X-ray Computed Tomography (CT). It is currently the only museum to house a state-of-the-art CT facility in the UK which holds over 3,500 sets of 3D data scans, making it one of the largest 3D digital collections in the world. Over 1,000 visitors have visited the facility in the last year with a significant number from the international community. The CT facility provides support to large-scale international projects such as SYNTHESYS (the Museum-led consortium of Europe's prestigious natural history museums), as well as carrying out high profile research on some of our rarest collections, such as the Tissint meteorite and the Blaschka glass models. CT has dramatically changed the way we and our colleagues can research our collections, including the contribution of data to form 'surrogate' specimens. This will take the use and care of collections firmly into the twenty-first century.Farah AhmedCollections and facilities Supporting the scientific community Our collections and science facilities provide a state-of-the-art infrastructure to support the international scientific community. Building on our core role to protect, develop and provide access to our globally important scientific collections, we work with our national and international partners to harness the opportunities offered by the digital, molecular and imaging revolutions. These technologies enable us to enhance the value of global natural history collections by improving the accessibility and utility of collection data in both the physical and virtual realms. The Natural History Museum's in-house Sequencing Facility has recently invested in an Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing platform. This cutting-edge equipment can produce millions of DNA sequence reads in less than one day, and is in the first generation of high-throughput sequencing machines that are easy to install and operate in general molecular biology laboratories. The resulting data can be used to gain unprecedented insight into microbial communities in ways that traditional microscopy and cell culturing methods could never achieve. We can detect gene expression patterns of almost any organism, sequence small genomes, map population changes in terms of gene flow and understand how pathogens are transmitted and cause disease. Next generation sequencing complements and enhances other elements of our molecular biology facilities. In particular, we will be able to gain previously unreachable insight into the materials in our collections by sequencing into the genomes of organisms, even ones that have been preserved for over a hundred years.David Bass Above Specimen jar containing copepod parasites, which live on the body surface of salmon and in large numbers can cause damage to the fish Above Chrysanthemum image scanned at high resolution to determine cell structure in 3D, and coloured to represent differences in tissue density 33Conservation Centre The Museum's Conservation Centre is a leading facility in collection preservation and care. A major focus for the Conservation Centre has been the 11-y ear collaborative research project on the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain (AHOB) which has been excavating evidence on human presence in Britain over the past million years. The AHOB collections represent an international resource for researchers studying habitation and climatic change in Britain. The preservation of these collections with their complete datasets is therefore critical to AHOB's international research programme. Working closely with curators and researchers, the AHOB conservation project in the Museum's Conservation Centre has focused on four mammal collections that are heavily used by the Origins group. These are Gough's Cave, Swanscombe, Grays Thurrock and Hyena Den. After a complete survey of these collections, staff restored and conserved the mammal and hominid specimens from Gough's Cave. In particular, three human skull-cups from the Gough's Cave collection were conserved to allow researchers to study them. Centre staff also conserved and reconstructed the Kent's Cavern Jaw, the earliest human jaw found in the UK, using CT imaging to accurately restore the object for publication in Nature.Efstratia Verveniotou and Chris Collins Cheddar man: the restoration of hominid specimens allows researchers better access and opportunity to study these collections Above Human remains from Gough's Cave, Somerset. At around 14,700 years old, they are the oldest directly dated examples in the world34 Compound eyes in early predators Our research showed that the top predator of the Cambrian seas, the metre-long Anomalocaris, had vision rivalling that of living insects and crustaceans. W orking on exceptionally preserved fossilised eyes from a 515-million-year-old deposit in South Australia, Greg Edgecombe from the Museum and his collaborators in Australia and Spain, discovered the details of the eyes of this early predator for the first time. The study was published in Nature. A pair of large stalked eyes was known in Anomalocaris from Canada and China but the surface of the fossil eye did not preserve the lenses. The Australian fossils revealed more than 16,000 lenses in each compound eye, vastly more than in any known eye fossils of a similar age. Finding direct evidence of compound eyes confirmed that Anomalocaris is a close relative of arthropods. We now know that eyes evolved very early during arthropod evolution, before other fundamental characteristics of this group, such as a hardened exoskeleton and walking legs.Greg EdgecombePublications and impact Disseminating new insights The Natural History Museum produces around 600 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals each year. These publications include both fundamental contributions to our core disciplines of taxonomy, systematics and mineralogy, and synthetic studies where we use our expertise to tackle questions of broad significance to science and society. We aim to increase our impact and value by leading new developments in science and by being a key collaborator for broader scientific initiatives. Pufferfish developmental biology Bony fishes comprise approximately half of all living vertebrates and show extreme variation in form. Zerina Johanson, Ralf Britz and Andie Hall are investigating a particularly interesting aspect of this diversity - their jaws and teeth. A paper published in PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America) showed that some of the most unusual dentitions occur in the pufferfishes (Tetraodontiformes), where adults possess a distinctive parrot-like beaked jaw. We thought that this functional cutting beak was present throughout growth, but our research showed instead that the beak formed from separate teeth in early developmental stages. We now believe that all bony fish dentitions, no matter how highly derived, form via these conserved early tooth developmental stages, with extreme diversity resulting from subtle changes to the tooth developmental process.Zerina Johanson, Ralf Britz and Andie Hall the Cambrian predator, Anomalocaris, that had vision rivalling living insects Above A male pufferfish guards his eggs. The 'beak' of pufferfishes is a unique dental structure and Museum scientists have discovered how it is formed 35 Phylogenetic reconstruction Until DNA sequencing became commonplace, systematists would choose characters to help reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between living organisms. In particular, morphological features with a shared common ancestry (homologous) have been and remain a vital resource for phylogenetics, systematics and taxonomy. However, such features may be scarce, or shared ancestry may be difficult to establish - for example, when comparing very different looking organisms or very similar organisms. Gene sequencing provides many more potentially homologous characters with which to untangle the branching patterns that make up the tree of life. The era of genomics and next-generation sequencing, which has brought forth 'phylogenomics', offers the prospect of huge amounts of data on lots of species and lots of genes. The problem with phylogenomics is that different genes have evolved differently from one another. Some have duplicated, some have converged, some have changed so much that they are saturated with change and have lost any evolutionary (phylogenetic) signal. Meanwhile our species sampling is restricted to what is available: those that have survived over time. Greater volumes of data have exacerbated some problems while more sophisticated computing has brought sense to the data being used. Ultimately, just as morphologists have chosen from the characters available, so too must molecular systematists. They must select from the genomic data sets for characters that can be most reliably called upon to reflect the branching points in the tree of life, whether they occurred rapidly, recently or in deep time. An international team, including Museum researcher Tim Littlewood, published in PLOS Biology a review of these problems in the light of resolving deep branches in the tree of animal life. This showed that lessons learned in the early history of systematics remain as pertinent today as they have always been.Tim Littlewood Tomato genomeTomatoes are a member of the plant family Solanaceae, as are potatoes, aubergines, and peppers. In terms of both economic value and production volume the family is the world's most important for vegetables. In 2012, a group of over 300 scientists from 14 countries, including Sandra Knapp from the Museum - the Tomato Genome Consortium (TGC) - reported the genome sequences of the domesticated tomato and its wild ancestor. The results were published in Nature. The sequences reveal the order, orientation, types and relative positions of all of the tomato's 35,000 genes. This knowledge will help researchers inv estigate how genes and the characteristics they encode are related, including how taste and fruit quality are controlled. The sequences also offer insight into how the tomato and its relatives have diversified and adapted to new environments. The genome expanded by duplication about 60 million years ago, but during the process of evolution and domestication, many of the doubled genes were lost. Some of the genes that remained evolved new functions that are involved in the development and control of the ripening process and so are of great interest to tomato breeders. The genome sequences will also allow researchers to probe more deeply into how humans have adapted plants for our own use, and why we have been able to domesticate some plants and not others. This could help us one day to use a wider variety of plant species for food than the few we currently rely on.Sandra Knapp 35,000 genes in the tomato were ordered and placed in the genome sequence: our scientists were part of this project Above Darwin's sketch of his concept of the 'tree of life' from 1837 (MS.DAR.121:p.36) 36 Media profile Getting our stories out there Our science features regularly in the media: new specimens in the collections, high-interest and high-impact papers, the ongoing work of Natural History Museum scientists, and comment by our experts on broader scientific themes and discoveries. This is an important facet of our public outreach and engagement, bringing the interest of science and the natural world to a wider international audience and emphasising the value and interest of our work to the public and other stakeholders. Collaboration between our press and web teams and our scientists is an essential factor in success. Above The Tissint meteorite, a piece of Mars that fell to Earth, is now in the Museum's collections Television is a high impact outlet to reach wider audiences with our work, and allows us to explore popular avenues of science in greater depth. Former senior research palaeontologist Richard Fortey published a popular science book Survivors in 2011. This was made into a three-hour BBC4 series about living fossils and attracted more than 800,000 viewers, a record for the channel. The series travelled around the world in search of animals and plants that time had left behind. Its central theme was to tr y to work out the secrets of how these living fossils had survived, especially as they had weathered the mass extinctions that terminated many famous fossil groups, including trilobites and dinosaurs. Richard is now a research associate of the Museum and Fellow of The Royal Society. He is a winner of the Michael Faraday Prize for excellence in communicating science to UK audiences.Richard Fortey Above Horseshoe crabs, one of the animals that has survived more than one mass extinctionMartian meteorite SurvivorsIn February 2012 the Museum acquired the largest piece of arguably the most important meteorite to have fallen in 100 years. The 1.1 kilogrammes Tissint was seen to fall in a shower of stones in southern Morocco in July 2011. Just 61 out of the 41,000 meteorites known to science come from Mars, and there have only been four other witnessed Martian meteorite falls, the last one in Nigeria in 1962. When they have been seen to fall and recovered quickly, like Tissint, meteorites offer a unique insight into Mars, as they have the lowest possible level of contamination from moisture in the air or bacteria. This acquisition, made possible with the support of a private donor, secured national and international coverage for the Museum which reached an audience of over 73 million people. Highlights included interviews with meteorites collections manager, Caroline Smith, in the New York Times, BBC Breakfast, BBC News at Six, ITV lunchtime news and a rare slot on Channel 4 evening news.Chloe Kembery and Caroline Smith 37 The Museum's collections, architecture and people inspired an hour-long television programme which took viewers behind the scenes and into the galleries to discover the secrets of the past and the future. The programme, named Museum Secrets, reached international audiences when it was broadcast and focused almost entirely on our scientific relevance and value. The programme featured interviews with researchers, curators and associates such as Alan Hart, Oliver Crimmen, Paul Clark, Chris Stringer, Julian Hume and Richard Sabin. It explored the Museum's work on the creatures living in the ocean depths and on meteorites from far away worlds; from early humans eating each other and the so-called cursed amethyst in The Vault. Clearly it is not possible to encapsulate all that the Museum does in just one hour but the popularity of the programme demonstrated just how strong an international reputation our science has.Claire Gilby The discovery of a dwarf mammoth, based on Museum fossils discovered by Dorothea Bate in Crete, was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B in May 2012 by Victoria Herridge and Adrian Lister. The importance of the paper lay in a demonstration of parallel evolution, since other Mediterranean island dwarfs were derived from a different elephant genus. The great antiquity of the find, between one and three million years old, indicated that episodes of colonisation and dwarfing had been continuous over a long period. Several media reports mentioned these factors but for most of them the 'hook' was the idea of a mammoth only a metre tall: the 'world's smallest'. BBC Radio 2 and Radio 4 News announced the find in bulletins throughout the morning of publication and BBC London Breakfast TV featured the story. Internationally, interviews were included by Canadian Broadcasting Company science show Quirks and Quarks 17. A myriad of newspapers covered the story over a week-long period, including the Guardian, the Sun, the Metro and the Daily Mail, as well as scientific journals Nature and Science. It even appeared in the New York Times and the South China Morning Post. A video featuring an interview with Victoria Herridge was posted to our website 18 and on YouTube19, where it has been viewed over 7,000 times.Adrian Lister Above Victoria Herridge with mammoth jaw and dwarf mammoth jaw fossilsAbove The 'cursed Delhi Purple sapphire' is in fact a magnificent amethyst gemstoneMuseum Secrets television programme The 'world's smallest mammoth' 38 Successful partnerships Funding for growth The Natural History Museum has achieved a great deal over the past two years, but we have exciting plans to do much more. Some of this work will inevitably be dependent on securing appropriate funding. We have therefore stepped up our efforts to obtain the funding we require within the context of partnerships that bring benefits both to ourselves and to these organisations that support us. We have become increasingly successful in applying for competitive external funding for science and public engagement over the past 20 years, and we are building on this track record. We also secure consultancy contracts, and are developing our reputation in a number of business sectors. Funders include the UK research councils, trusts and foundations, the European Union and others. These sources of funding allow us to collaborate more effectively with universities, cultural partners and others.

It was awarded a third phase of funding by the European Commission's Infrastructure Programme in 2012. The cumulative value of SYNTHESYS1, 2 and 3 will be \u20ac28.2 million. The SYNTHESYS consortium 20 comprises 18 institutions in 12 European countries. The project has three key elements: Access, Joint Research Activity and Network Activity.Access funds collections-based research visits to 15 of our consortium's institutions for scientists working in European states. Under SYNTHESYS1 and 2 more than 37,000 research visit days have been delivered which have, so far, contributed to more than 1,200 peer-reviewed papers. SYNTHESYS3 will offer a further 11,000 funded visitor days from 2013. The Joint Research Activity by the consortium's staff members has delivered new tools for delivering sequenceable DNA by enhancing and improving the extraction tools and protocols. The Joint Research Activity developed non-invasive tools for estimating the presence of ancient DNA and optimal extraction protocols for ancient and more modern DNA. By focusing the Joint Research Activity on DNA extraction, SYNTHESYS will exploit a largely untapped facet of the consortium's 337 million strong collections. In SYNTHESYS3 the Joint Research Activity will focus on accelerating the de velopment and quality of virtual collections across Europe to enhance access for scientists worldwide unable to travel to use the physical collections. This will be achieved through research into automated data collection methods from digital images, new methods for 3D digitisation and crowd-sourcing metadata enrichment of digital images. Network Activities continue work to improve collection management standards across Europe and beyond with a focus on virtual and new physical collections such as genomic repositories. Best practice guides and training tools are among the planned outputs, many of which will be based on the work delivered in the Joint Research Activity. The popular collection management self-assessment tool delivered in SYNTHESYS2 will be continuing 21.

This celebrated contribution to the EU-funded Researchers' Night has involved more than 21,360 visitors in 107,420 interactions with our scientists over three vibrant evenings since 2010. We use the event's scale and range of audiences to explore new ways to engage and empower people for future action and change. Most visitors were from the harder to reach 17-35-year-old category but we saw many more schools and families taking part in 2012. Our rigorous evaluation demonstrates that Science Uncovered raises awareness of the relevance of science to everyday lives and the value of engaging a wider audience with our science. More than 200 researchers across 28 organisations have joined us to extend our reach and scale. This network of partnerships stretches from Imperial College across the globe to NASA. Collaboration not only helps us facilitate wider conversations with visitors but also share our most effective public engagement practice. Science Uncovered is heralded by EU funders as demonstrating excellence in this area and we hope that our collaborative approach will shape the direction for such funding in years ahead.

The programme of work is split into four projects: The European Rift Valley Project, led by Chris Stringer and involving collaborators at the Natural History Museum, British Museum, University College London (UCL), and Queen Mary, University of London, will focus on submerged Palaeolithic sites at the edge of a major rift valley system now covered by the North Sea, in a region that has revealed evidence of the earliest human occupation of Britain. The Morocco Caves Project is a collaboration between Louise Humphrey and colleagues at the Museum, the University of Oxford and Institut National des Sciences de l'Arch\u00e9ologie et du Patrimoine in Rabat. Research will reinterpret 60 years of archaeological investigations at the Palaeolithic site of Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt based on recently discovered archives and our own excavation records. Prehistoric Behaviour in 3D is led by Silvia Bello with collaborations at the Museum, UCL and the British Museum. It will investigate human behaviour through the traces left on animal and human bones and teeth by human activities including engraving, butchery, funerary behaviour and cannibalism. The ALSPAC Tooth Project, led by Louise Humphrey with collaborators at UCL, the University of Bristol and the Museum will investigate deciduous teeth donated by children enrolled on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). It will reveal how evidence of infant health and diet is reflected in enamel growth, structure and chemical composition. Louise Humphrey, Silvia Bello and Chris Stringer Above Louise Humphrey excavating at Taforalt in Morocco For the last eight years the Museum has been part of a global initiative supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Originally focused on Africa and Latin America, and now extended across the world, the Global Plants Initiative is a consortium of over 200 partner herbaria, all actively pursuing a common goal, and also developing common international standards. As an active member of this group the Museum has also been able to exploit the relationships developed within the initiative, to further our own research aims to the benefit of stakeholders within and outside the Museum. A good example of this is the development of the Plant Collector Database 22, an online resource developed and managed by the Museum but with direct input from many other major partners. This resource is now fully accessible and extensively used by other partners in the initiative to aid development of their own online collections resources. Significantly, it is also of great interest to other researchers not necessarily from within the botanical or scientific community. It is a good example of how building partnerships (whether within or independent of other initiatives) can help raise the profile of the Museum. At the same time these partnerships f urther scientific research both within the Museum and in the home institutions of our partners who have helped create the resource.Steve Cafferty Above Banksia specimen image from the Cook voyage, one of many digitised specimens now on the Plant Collector DatabaseCalleva Foundation and human origins Mellon Foundation and plant digitisation42 References Overview from the Director of Science 1 www.nhm.ac.uk/sciencestrategy Challenge 1 2 www.biodiversitylibrary.org 3 www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/124796#page/4/mode/2up 4 http://plants.jstor.org/ Challenge 13 \u00a9 Kayp.5, 9, 13, 21 mosquito, 22 eggplant, 'Tree life' sketch reproduced by kind permission of the Syndics of Cambridge University Library All other images \u00a9 Natural History MuseumAll efforts have been made to list all copyright holders.

Museum scientists are using next-generation sequencing to investigate the biology of micro-organisms, with particular focus on their diversity and role in emerging diseases and food security (see pages 16, 20 and 22 of this review). Radiolaria are of special importance because they form characteristic micro-fossils that are used to date geological strata, so are a key tool both in understanding the evolution of our planet and in oil exploration.
