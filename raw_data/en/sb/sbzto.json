Most people who have P. jirovecii pneumonia develop a fever, shortness of breath, and a dry cough, often slowly. The lungs may not be able to deliver sufficient oxygen to the blood, leading to shortness of breath that is sometimes severe. Diagnosis of Pneumonia in Immunocompromised People Chest x-ray Microscopic examination of a sputum (thick or discolored mucus) sample Blood cultures Pulse oximetry The diagnosis of pneumonia in a person who has a weakened immune system is based on the person's symptoms, the results of a chest x-ray or CT scan, and the results of sputum and blood tests. Chest x-rays may be normal or may show signs of infection. Doctors obtain sputum samples by giving a vapor treatment that causes the person to cough deeply (inducing sputum production) or insert a [bronchoscope](/home/lung-and-airway-disorders/diagnosis-of-lung-disorders/bronchoscopy) [ Bronchoscopy Bronchoscopy is a direct visual examination of the voice box (larynx) and airways through a viewing tube (a bronchoscope).

Sputum samples obtained by inducing a cough and particularly those obtained with a bronchoscope are less likely to contain saliva and are more likely than expectorated sputum samples to allow doctors to identify the organism causing pneumonia. Doctors usually take a sample of blood so they can try to grow (culture) the bacteria in the laboratory and identify it. People who have a weakened immune system may have low levels of oxygen in their blood. Doctors can measure levels of oxygen in the blood without taking a blood sample by placing a sensor on a finger or an earlobe. This test is called [pulse oximetry](/home/lung-and-airway-disorders/diagnosis-of-lung-disorders/arterial-blood-gas-abg-analysis-and-pulse-oximetry#v34534678) [ Pulse oximetry Both arterial blood gas testing and pulse oximetry measure the amount of oxygen in the blood, which helps determine how well the lungs are functioning.

Prognosis for Pneumonia in Immunocompromised People Even when the pneumonia is treated, the overall death rate is higher than that for generally healthy people with [community-acquired pneumonia](/home/lung-and-airway-disorders/pneumonia/community-acquired-pneumonia) [ Community-Acquired Pneumonia Community-acquired pneumonia is lung infection that develops in people who are not patients in a hospital, usually in people with normal (competent) immune systems, or in those who are immunocompromised... read more ](/home/lung-and-airway-disorders/pneumonia/community-acquired-pneumonia) because infections are much harder to treat in people with immune system problems and because these people tend to be much sicker, even before pneumonia begins. The overall death rate for people who have P. jirovecii pneumonia is high. Prevention of Pneumonia in Immunocompromised People Doctors often give treatments to help bolster the person's immune system and prevent pneumonia. For example, in people whose immune system has been weakened by cancer treatment, doctors may give a drug called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor to enhance the production of white blood cells (the type that fight infection). People who are at risk of pneumonia caused by bacteria should receive vaccinations against [pneumococcus](/home/infections/immunization/pneumococcal-vaccine) [ Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal vaccines help protect against bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci).

These infections may be serious in children. Use... read more ](/home/infections/immunization/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-vaccine) . The combination antibiotic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can be used to help prevent P. jirovecii pneumonia in people at risk. This drug's side effects, which are particularly common among people who have AIDS, include rashes, a reduced number of infection-fighting white blood cells, and fever. Alternative preventive drug treatments are dapsone or pentamidine. Treatment of Pneumonia in Immunocompromised People Antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals Treatment of any immune system problem Treatment of pneumonia depends on the Specific immune system problem Severity of illness Organisms that may be causing infection Doctors usually give an antibiotic that is effective against many organisms (a broad-spectrum antibiotic). If the person's condition does not improve, doctors may add an additional drug that is effective against viruses or fungi.

Drugs that suppress the immune system (such as chemotherapy drugs or drugs used to treat autoimmune disorders) should be temporarily stopped until the infection has resolved. People who have P. jirovecii pneumonia are given the combination antibiotic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Alternative drugs are dapsone, atovaquone, clindamycin, and pentamidine. Some people with severe pneumonia due to P. jirovecii are also given the corticosteroid prednisone to reduce inflammation. [VIEW PROFESSIONAL VERSION](#) [ VIEW PROFESSIONAL VERSION ] "}
