If 260 any such opinion is contested, the court shall hold a 261 hearing on the issue. The report or reports may be received 262 in evidence at any hearing on the issue but the party 263 contesting any opinion therein relative to fitness to 264 HCS SS SCS SB 106 115 proceed shall have the right to summon and to cross -examine 265 the examiner who rendered such opinion and to offer evidence 266 upon the issue; 267 (4) If the accused is found men tally fit to proceed, 268 the criminal proceedings shall be resumed; 269 (5) If it is found that the accused lacks mental 270 fitness to proceed but there is a substantial probability 271 the accused will be mentally fit to proceed in the 272 reasonably foreseeable future, the court shall continue such 273 commitment for a period not longer than six months, after 274 which the court shall reinstitute the proceedings required 275 under subdivision (1) of this subsection; 276 (6) If it is found that the accused lacks mental 277 fitness to proceed and there is no substantial probability 278 that the accused will be mentally fit to proceed in the 279 reasonably foreseeable future, the court shall dismiss the 280 charges without prejudice and the accused shall be 281 discharged, but only if pro per proceedings have been filed 282 under chapter 632 or chapter 475, in which case those 283 sections and no others will be applicable.

The result of any examinations made pursuant 311 to this section shall not be a public record or open to the 312 public. 313 [14.] 15.

A person is not responsible for criminal 1 conduct if, at the time of such conduct, as a result of 2 mental disease or de fect such person was incapable of 3 knowing and appreciating the nature, quality, or 4 wrongfulness of such person's conduct. 5 2.

Such a plea or notice shall not deprive the 14 accused of other defenses. The state may accept a defense 15 of mental disease or defect excluding responsibi lity, 16 whether raised by plea or written notice, if the accused has 17 no other defense and files a written notice to that effect. 18 The state shall not accept a defense of mental disease or 19 defect excluding responsibility in the absence of any 20 pretrial ev aluation as described in this section or section 21 552.020. Upon the state's acceptance of the defense of 22 mental disease or defect excluding responsibility, the court 23 shall proceed to order the commitment of the accused as 24 provided in section 552.040 in cases of persons acquitted on 25 the ground of mental disease or defect excluding 26 responsibility, and further proceedings shall be had 27 regarding the confinement and release of the accused as 28 provided in section 552.040. 29 HCS SS SCS SB 106 118 3.

All persons are presumed to be free of mental 118 disease or defect excluding responsibility for their 119 conduct, whether or not previously adjudicated in this or 120 any other state to be or to have been sexual or social 121 psychopaths, or incompetent; provided , however, the court 122 may admit evidence presented at such adjudication based on 123 its probative value. The issue of whether any person had a 124 HCS SS SCS SB 106 121 mental disease or defect excluding responsibility for such 125 person's conduct is one for the trier of fact to deci de upon 126 the introduction of substantial evidence of lack of such 127 responsibility. But, in the absence of such evidence, the 128 presumption shall be conclusive. Upon the introduction of 129 substantial evidence of lack of such responsibility, the 130 presumption shall not disappear and shall alone be 131 sufficient to take that issue to the trier of fact. The 132 jury shall be instructed as to the existence and nature of 133 such presumption when requested by the state and, where the 134 issue of such responsibility is one for the jury to decide, 135 the jury shall be told that the burden rests upon the 136 accused to show by a preponderance or greater weight of the 137 credible evidence that the defendant was suffering from a 138 mental disease or defect excluding responsibility at the 139 time of the conduct charged against the defendant. At the 140 request of the defense the jury shall be instructed by the 141 court as to the contents of subsection 2 of section 552.040. 142 7. When the accused is acquitted on the ground of 143 mental disease o r defect excluding responsibility, the 144 verdict and the judgment shall so state as well as state the 145 offense for which the accused was acquitted. The clerk of 146 the court shall furnish a copy of any judgment or order of 147 commitment to the department of me ntal health pursuant to 148 this section to the criminal records central repository 149 pursuant to section 43.503. 150 552.040. 1. For the purposes of this section, the 1 following words mean: 2 (1) \"Prosecutor of the jurisdiction\", the pros ecuting 3 attorney in a county or the circuit attorney of a city not 4 within a county; 5 HCS SS SCS SB 106 122 (2) \"Secure facility\", a state mental health facility, 6 state developmental disability facility, private facility 7 under contract with the department of mental heal th, or a 8 section within any of these facilities, in which persons 9 committed to the department of mental health pursuant to 10 this chapter shall not be permitted to move about the 11 facility or section of the facility, nor to leave the 12 facility or section of the facility, without approval by the 13 head of the facility or such head's designee and adequate 14 supervision consistent with the safety of the public and the 15 person's treatment, habilitation or rehabilitation plan; 16 (3) \"Tried and acquitted\" incl udes both pleas of 17 mental disease or defect excluding responsibility that are 18 accepted by the court and acquittals on the ground of mental 19 disease or defect excluding responsibility following the 20 proceedings set forth in section 552.030. 21 2. When an accused is tried and acquitted on the 22 ground of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility, 23 the court shall order such person committed to the director 24 of the department of mental health for custody. The court 25 shall also order custody and ca re in a state mental health 26 or intellectual disability facility unless an immediate 27 conditional release is granted pursuant to this section. If 28 the accused has not been charged with a dangerous felony as 29 defined in section 556.061, or with murder in t he first 30 degree pursuant to section 565.020, or sexual assault 31 pursuant to section 566.040, or the attempts thereof, and 32 the examination contains an opinion that the accused should 33 be immediately conditionally released to the community by 34 the court, t he court shall hold a hearing to determine if an 35 immediate conditional release is appropriate pursuant to the 36 procedures for conditional release set out in subsections 10 37 HCS SS SCS SB 106 123 to 14 of this section. Prior to the hearing, the court 38 shall direct the director of the department of mental 39 health, or the director's designee, to have the accused 40 examined to determine conditions of confinement in 41 accordance with subsection [4] 5 of section 552.020. The 42 provisions of subsection 16 of this section shall be 43 applicable to defendants granted an immediate conditional 44 release and the director shall honor the immediate 45 conditional release as granted by the court. If the court 46 determines that an immediate conditional release is 47 warranted, the court shall order the person committed to the 48 director of the department of mental health before ordering 49 such a release. The court granting the immediate 50 conditional release shall retain jurisdiction over the case 51 for the duration of the conditional release. This shall not 52 limit the authority of the director of the department of 53 mental health or the director's designee to revoke the 54 conditional release or the trial release of any committed 55 person pursuant to subsection 17 of this section. If the 56 accused is committe d to a mental health or developmental 57 disability facility, the director of the department of 58 mental health, or the director's designee, shall determine 59 the time, place and conditions of confinement. 60 3. The provisions of sections 630.110, apply to 64 persons committed pursuant to subsection 2 of this section. 65 If the department does not h ave a treatment or 66 rehabilitation program for a mental disease or defect of an 67 individual, that fact may not be the basis for a release 68 from commitment. Notwithstanding any other provision of law 69 HCS SS SCS SB 106 124 to the contrary, no person committed to the department of 70 mental health who has been tried and acquitted by reason of 71 mental disease or defect as provided in section 552.030 72 shall be conditionally or unconditionally released unless 73 the procedures set out in this section are followed. Upon 74 request by an i ndigent committed person, the appropriate 75 court may appoint the office of the public defender to 76 represent such person in any conditional or unconditional 77 release proceeding under this section. 78 4. Notwithstanding section 630.115, any person 79 committed pursuant to subsection 2 of this section shall be 80 kept in a secure facility until such time as a court of 81 competent jurisdiction enters an order granting a 82 conditional or unconditional release to a nonsecure facility. 83 5. The committed person or the head of the facility 84 where the person is committed may file an application in the 85 court that committed the person seeking an order releasing 86 the committed person unconditionally; except that any person 87 who has been denied an application for a co nditional release 88 pursuant to subsection 13 of this section shall not be 89 eligible to file for an unconditional release until the 90 expiration of one year from such denial. In the case of a 91 person who was immediately conditionally released after 92 being committed to the department of mental health, the 93 released person or the director of the department of mental 94 health, or the director's designee, may file an application 95 in the same court that released the committed person seeking 96 an order releasing the committed person unconditionally. 97 Copies of the application shall be served personally or by 98 certified mail upon the head of the facility unless the head 99 of the facility files the application, the committed person 100 unless the committed person files th e application, or unless 101 HCS SS SCS SB 106 125 the committed person was immediately conditionally released, 102 the director of the department of mental health, and the 103 prosecutor of the jurisdiction where the committed person 104 was tried and acquitted. Any party objecting to th e 105 proposed release must do so in writing within thirty days 106 after service.

Prior to the 113 hearing any of the parties, up on written application, shall 114 be entitled to an examination of the committed person, by a 115 psychiatrist or psychologist, as defined in section 632.005, 116 or a physician with a minimum of one year training or 117 experience in providing treatment or services t o 118 intellectually disabled or mentally ill individuals of its 119 own choosing and at its expense. The report of the mental 120 condition of the committed person shall accompany the 121 application. By agreement of all parties to the proceeding 122 any report of the mental condition of the committed person 123 which may accompany the application for release or which is 124 filed in objection thereto may be received by evidence, but 125 the party contesting any opinion therein shall have the 126 right to summon and to cross -examine the examiner who 127 rendered such opinion and to offer evidence upon the issue. 128 6. By agreement of all the parties and leave of court, 129 the hearing may be waived, in which case an order granting 130 an unconditional release shall be entered in accordan ce with 131 subsection 8 of this section. 132 HCS SS SCS SB 106 126 7. At a hearing to determine if the committed person 133 should be unconditionally released, the court shall consider 134 the following factors in addition to any other relevant 135 evidence: 136 (1) Whether or not the committed person presently has 137 a mental disease or defect; 138 (2) The nature of the offense for which the committed 139 person was committed; 140 (3) The committed person's behavior while confined in 141 a mental health facility; 142 (4) The elapsed tim e between the hearing and the last 143 reported unlawful or dangerous act; 144 (5) Whether the person has had conditional releases 145 without incident; and 146 (6) Whether the determination that the committed 147 person is not dangerous to himself or others is dependent on 148 the person's taking drugs, medicine or narcotics. 149 The burden of persuasion for any person committed to a 150 mental health facility under the provisions of this section 151 upon acquittal on the grounds of mental disease or defect 152 excluding res ponsibility shall be on the party seeking 153 unconditional release to prove by clear and convincing 154 evidence that the person for whom unconditional release is 155 sought does not have, and in the reasonable future is not 156 likely to have, a mental disease or de fect rendering the 157 person dangerous to the safety of himself or others. 158 8. The court shall enter an order either denying the 159 application for unconditional release or granting an 160 unconditional release. An order denying the application 161 shall be wi thout prejudice to the filing of another 162 HCS SS SCS SB 106 127 application after the expiration of one year from the denial 163 of the last application. 164 9. No committed person shall be unconditionally 165 released unless it is determined through the procedures in 166 this section that the person does not have, and in the 167 reasonable future is not likely to have, a mental disease or 168 defect rendering the person dangerous to the safety of 169 himself or others. 170 10. The committed person or the head of the facility 171 where the perso n is committed may file an application in the 172 court having probate jurisdiction over the facility where 173 the person is detained for a hearing to determine whether 174 the committed person shall be released conditionally.

In such cases, jurisdiction over 182 the application for conditional release shall be in the 183 committing court. In the case of a person who was 184 immediately conditi onally released after being committed to 185 the department of mental health, the released person or the 186 director of the department of mental health, or the 187 director's designee, may file an application in the same 188 court that released the person seeking to amend or modify 189 the existing release.

In the case of a person who was 221 immediately conditiona lly released after being committed to 222 the department of mental health, the prosecutor of the 223 HCS SS SCS SB 106 129 jurisdiction where the person was tried and acquitted shall 224 appear and represent the public safety interest. 225 11. By agreement of all the parties, the hear ing may 226 be waived, in which case an order granting a conditional 227 release, stating the conditions and duration agreed upon by 228 all the parties and the court, shall be entered in 229 accordance with subsection 13 of this section. 230 12. At a hearing to det ermine if the committed person 231 should be conditionally released, the court shall consider 232 the following factors in addition to any other relevant 233 evidence: 234 (1) The nature of the offense for which the committed 235 person was committed; 236 (2) The person's behavior while confined in a mental 237 health facility; 238 (3) The elapsed time between the hearing and the last 239 reported unlawful or dangerous act; 240 (4) The nature of the person's proposed release plan; 241 (5) The presence or absence in the community of family 242 or others willing to take responsibility to help the 243 defendant adhere to the conditions of the release; and 244 (6) Whether the person has had previous conditional 245 releases without incident. 246 The burden of persuasion for any person committed to a 247 mental health facility under the provisions of this section 248 upon acquittal on the grounds of mental disease or defect 249 excluding responsibility shall be on the party seeking 250 release to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the 251 person for whom release is sought is not likely to be 252 dangerous to others while on conditional release. 253 HCS SS SCS SB 106 130 13. The court shall enter an order either denying the 254 application for a conditional release or granting 255 conditional release. An order denyi ng the application shall 256 be without prejudice to the filing of another application 257 after the expiration of one year from the denial of the last 258 application. 259 14. No committed person shall be conditionally 260 released until it is determined that the c ommitted person is 261 not likely to be dangerous to others while on conditional 262 release. 263 15.

If a person on conditional release is returned 322 to a facility under the provisions of this subsect ion, a 323 hearing shall be held within ninety -six hours, excluding 324 Saturdays, Sundays and state holidays, to determine whether 325 the person violated the conditions of the release or whether 326 resumption of full -time hospitalization is the least 327 restrictive a lternative consistent with the person's needs 328 and public safety.

At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court or 23 jury finds that the respondent, as the result of mental 24 illness, present s a likelihood of serious harm to himself or 25 herself or to others, and the court finds that a program 26 appropriate to handle the respondent's condition has agreed 27 to accept him or her, the court shall order the respondent 28 to be detained for involuntary treatment in the least 29 restrictive environment for a period not to exceed ninety 30 days or for outpatient detention and treatment under the 31 supervision of a mental health program in the least 32 HCS SS SCS SB 106 171 restrictive environment for a period not to exceed one 33 hundred eighty days. 34 632.355. 1. At the expiration of the ninety -day 1 inpatient commitment period ordered by the court pursuant to 2 section 632.350, the respondent may be detained and treated 3 as an involuntarily inpatient for an additional period of 4 time not to exceed one year or such lesser period of time as 5 determined by the court or may be detained for outpatient 6 detention and treatment for a period of time not to exceed 7 one hundred eighty days; provided, that: 8 (1) The responden t is mentally ill and continues to 9 present a likelihood of serious harm to himself or herself 10 or to others; and 11 (2) The court after a hearing orders the person 12 detained and treated for the additional period. 13 2. Within the ninety -day commitme nt period, the head 14 of the mental health program [or the mental health 15 coordinator ] may file or cause to be filed, in compliance 16 with the requirements of section 632.330, a petition for a 17 one-year inpatient detention and treatment period or a 18 petition for outpatient detention and treatment for a period 19 not to exceed one hundred eighty days if he or she has 20 reasonable cause to believe that the respondent is mentally 21 ill and as a result presents a likelihood of serious harm to 22 himself or herself or others, and that further detention and 23 treatment is necessary pursuant to an individualized 24 treatment plan prepared by the program and filed with the 25 court. Procedures specified in sections 632.340, 632.345 26 and 632.350 shall be followed. 27 3. At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court or 28 jury finds that the respondent, as the result of mental 29 illness, presents a likelihood of serious harm to himself or 30 HCS SS SCS SB 106 172 herself or others, and the court finds that a program 31 appropriate to handle the respondent 's condition has agreed 32 to accept him or her, the court shall order that the 33 respondent be detained for involuntary treatment in the 34 least restrictive environment for a period not to exceed one 35 year or for outpatient detention and treatment under the 36 supervision of a mental health program in the least 37 restrictive environment for a period not to exceed one 38 hundred eighty days. 39 632.370. 1. The department may transfer, or authorize 1 the transfer of, an involuntary patient detained u nder this 2 chapter, chapter 211, chapter 475, or chapter 552 from one 3 mental health program to another if the department 4 determines that it would be consistent with the medical 5 needs of the patient to do so. If a minor is transferred 6 from a ward for m inors to an adult ward, the department 7 shall conduct a due process hearing within six days of such 8 transfer during which hearing the head of the program shall 9 have the burden to show that the transfer is appropriate for 10 the medical needs of the minor. Whenever a patient is 11 transferred, written notice thereof shall be given after 12 obtaining the consent of the patient, his or her parent if 13 he or she is a minor or his or her legal guardian to his or 14 her legal guardian, parents and spouse, or, if none b e 15 known, his or her nearest known relative or friend. In all 16 such transfers, due consideration shall be given to the 17 relationship of the patient to his or her family, legal 18 guardian or friends, so as to maintain relationships and 19 encourage visits ben eficial to the patient. The head of the 20 mental health program shall notify the court ordering 21 detention or commitment, the patient's last known attorney 22 of record [and the mental health coordinator for the 23 HCS SS SCS SB 106 173 region], and if the person was committed purs uant to chapter 24 552, to the prosecuting attorney of the jurisdiction where 25 the person was tried and acquitted, of any transfer from one 26 mental health facility to another. The prosecutor of the 27 jurisdiction where the person was tried and acquitted shal l 28 use their best efforts to notify the victims of dangerous 29 felonies. Notification by the appropriate person or agency 30 by certified mail to the most current address provided by 31 the victim shall constitute compliance with the victim 32 notification requi rement of this section. In the case of a 33 patient committed under chapter 211, the court, on its own 34 motion, may hold a hearing on the transfer to determine 35 whether such transfer is appropriate to the medical needs of 36 the patient. 37 2. Upon receipt of a certificate of an agency of the 38 United States that facilities are available for the care or 39 treatment of any individual heretofore ordered involuntarily 40 detained, treated and evaluated pursuant to this chapter in 41 any facility for the care or trea tment of persons with a 42 mental illness or an intellectual disability or a 43 developmental disability and that such individual is 44 eligible for care or treatment in a hospital or institution 45 of such agency, the department may cause his or her transfer 46 to such agency of the United States for hospitalization. 47 Upon effecting any such transfer, the court ordering 48 hospitalization, the legal guardian, spouse and parents, or, 49 if none be known, his or her nearest known relative or 50 friend shall be notified the reof immediately by the 51 department. No person shall be transferred to an agency of 52 the United States if he or she is confined pursuant to a 53 conviction for any felony or misdemeanor or if he or she has 54 been acquitted of any felony or misdemeanor solely on the 55 HCS SS SCS SB 106 174 ground of mental illness, unless prior to transfer the court 56 originally ordering confinement of such person enters an 57 order for the transfer after appropriate motion and 58 hearing. Any person transferred to an agency of the United 59 States shall be deemed to be hospitalized by such agency 60 pursuant to the original order of hospitalization. 61 632.375. 1. At least once every one hundred eighty 1 days, the head of each mental health program shall have each 2 respondent who is detaine d at the program for a one -year 3 period under this chapter examined and evaluated to 4 determine if the respondent continues to be mentally ill, 5 and as a result presents a likelihood of serious harm to 6 himself or herself or others. The court, [the mental health 7 coordinator for the region, ] the respondent , and the 8 respondent's attorney shall be provided copies of the report 9 of the examination and evaluation described by this section 10 and the respondent's individualized treatment plan. 11 2. Upon rece ipt of the report, the court may, upon its 12 own motion, or shall, upon the motion of the respondent, 13 order a hearing to be held as to the need for continued 14 detention and involuntary treatment. At the conclusion of 15 the hearing, the court may order: 16 (1) The discharge of the respondent; or 17 (2) An appropriate least restrictive course of 18 detention and involuntary treatment; or 19 (3) The respondent to be remanded to the mental health 20 program for the unexpired portion of the original commitm ent 21 order. 22 632.385. 1. The head of a mental health facility 1 shall release a patient, whether voluntary or involuntary, 2 from the facility to the least restrictive environment, 3 including referral to and subsequent placement in the 4 HCS SS SCS SB 106 175 placement program of the department, when he or she believes 5 that such release is in the best interests of the patient. 6 Release to the least restrictive environment shall include 7 provisions for continuing responsibility to and by the 8 facility. 9 2. Release to the least restrictive environment may be 10 conditioned on the patient receiving outpatient care as 11 prescribed by the head of the mental health facility from 12 which the patient is being released. The period of 13 treatment in the least restrictiv e environment shall not 14 exceed the period of one year. 15 3. The facility or agency which is to provide 16 treatment in the least restrictive environment must agree in 17 writing to assume such responsibility. A copy of the 18 conditions for release shall b e given to the patient, to the 19 probate division of the circuit court having jurisdiction 20 and the mental health facility providing treatment. 21 4. The head of a mental health facility may permit a 22 respondent detained for treatment to leave the facili ty for 23 prescribed short periods on trial visit during his or her 24 detention subject to conditions prescribed by the head of 25 the mental health facility. 26 5. The head of the mental health facility providing 27 treatment may modify the conditions for con tinued release 28 from the facility to the least restrictive environment when 29 such modification is in the best interest of the patient. 30 Notification of any changes shall be sent to the patient and 31 to the court within ninety -six hours if the patient is 32 involuntarily detained under this chapter. Upon a receipt 33 of a notification returning the patient to the facility as 34 an inpatient, the committing court shall, if necessary, 35 order the sheriff or other law enforcement official to 36 HCS SS SCS SB 106 176 apprehend and transport the patient to the facility. The 37 committing court may, on its own motion or shall upon the 38 respondent's motion, order a hearing to be held on the need 39 for such change. 40 632.390. 1. The head of a mental health program shall 1 release any person who is involuntarily detained under this 2 chapter when, in his or her opinion, the person is no longer 3 mentally ill or the person , although mentally ill, does not 4 present a likelihood of serious harm to himself or herself 5 or others, even thou gh the detention period has not expired. 6 2. Whenever the head of a mental health program 7 discharges a person prior to the expiration of the detention 8 order, he or she shall notify , in writing , the court [and 9 the mental health coordinator ]. 10 3. Whenever a respondent voluntarily admits himself or 11 herself and the head of a mental health program accepts the 12 admission application submitted by respondent in good faith 13 under section 632.105, the respondent's involuntary 14 detention shall cease, and the head of the program shall 15 notify, in writing, the court [and the mental health 16 coordinator ]. 17 632.392. 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of 1 subsection 1 of section 630.140, a mental health program and 2 any treating physician, up on release of a patient who was 3 committed or who is civilly detained and consents to 4 voluntary treatment during the course of the inpatient stay 5 pursuant to section 63 2.375: 7 (1) Shall provide to the patient and his or her care 8 provider a written packet of educational information 9 developed and supplied by the department of mental health 10 describing symptoms of common mental illnesses, early 11 HCS SS SCS SB 106 177 warning signs of deco mpensation, and availability of other 12 education, community and statewide services.

The chief officer of any hospital or institution 13 operated by such agency and in which the individual is so 14 hospitalized shall, with respect to such individual, be 15 vested with the same powers as the heads of hospitals or the 16 division within this state have with respect to detention, 17 custody, transfer, conditional release and discharge of 18 patients. Jurisdict ion is retained in the appropriate 19 courts of this state at any time to inquire into the mental 20 condition of an individual so hospitalized and to determine 21 the necessity for continuance of his or her hospitalization, 22 and every order of hospitalization i ssued pursuant to this 23 section is so conditioned. 24 HCS SS SCS SB 106 179 2. An order of a court of competent jurisdiction of 25 another state, or of the District of Columbia, authorizing 26 hospitalization of an individual by any agency of the United 27 States shall have the sa me force and effect as to the 28 individual while in this state as in the jurisdiction in 29 which is situated the court entering the order, and the 30 courts of the state or District of Columbia issuing the 31 order shall be deemed to have retained jurisdiction o f the 32 individual so hospitalized for the purpose of inquiring into 33 his or her mental condition and of determining the necessity 34 for continuance of his or her hospitalization, as is 35 provided in subsection 1 of this section with respect to 36 individuals o rdered hospitalized by the courts of this 37 state.

Once a court has assumed 11 jurisdiction with respect to involuntary detention 12 proceedings, no other c ourt shall assume jurisdiction until 13 the court having prior jurisdiction has transferred 14 jurisdiction and all papers, files, and transcripts. If the 15 court having jurisdiction receives notice that a respondent 16 has been transferred to a mental health pr ogram in another 17 county, the court shall transfer jurisdiction, along with 18 all papers, files and transcripts, to the court in the 19 county where the respondent has been transferred. 20 632.415. 1. The judge having probate jurisdiction in 1 each county where a mental health program is located shall 2 prepare and maintain a current register of attorneys who 3 have agreed to be appointed to represent respondents against 4 whom involuntary civil detention proceedings have been 5 instituted in such county. The judge may choose lawyers who 6 are paid by any public or private agency or other lawyers 7 who are appointed to the register. [The register shall be 8 provided to the mental health coordinator for the area which 9 includes the county for which t he list was prepared. A new 10 register shall be provided to the mental health coordinator 11 each time a new attorney is added. ] 12 HCS SS SCS SB 106 181 2.
