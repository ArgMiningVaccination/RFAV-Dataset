We are oriented towards the needs of the person with cancer and may be less conservative than research-based organizations that take the long view. People with cancer don't have the luxury to wait for the large, gold-standard, decades-long research studies to find definitive answers. If something offers real hope based on evidence, we present that. We also share if evidence to date does not show an effect or even shows harm from using a therapy. As new research is published, our assessments and ratings can change. Throughout the site, we link readily to all the evidence that informs our assessments and ratings. We are transparent about all our information. - We are funded by individual donors and private foundations and do not receive funds from any manufacturers or retailers who profit from cancer treatments or therapies. - We investigate cancer therapies and practices by relying heavily on peer-reviewed studies and reviews in medical journals. Oncology experts review our therapies and handbooks. - We do not promote any specific approaches or therapies. We offer information so that people facing difficult choices can make informed decisions.
