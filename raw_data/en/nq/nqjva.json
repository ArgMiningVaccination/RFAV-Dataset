While several vaccine candidates are currently under development, antivirals with the potential to limit virus transmission or block infection are also being explored. Plant production platforms are being used to generate vaccines and antiviral proteins inexpensively and at mass scale. The following review discusses the biology and origins of the current coronavirus pandemic, and describes some of the conventional, synthetic, and plant-based approaches to address the challenge that it presents to our way of life. Keywords: coronavirus; antibodies; plants; vaccines; antivirals 1. a very diverse group of positive-sense enveloped RNA viruses with genomes ranging between 27-32 kb [ 1]. The viral structure comprises four structural proteins including the spike, nucleocapsid, membrane and envelope pro- tein [ 2], several non-structural proteins and proteins derived from the host cell [ 1]. The CoVs display a characteristic 'crown-like' appearance under an electron microscope owing to the presence of club-shaped protein projections on the viral surface (ECDC, 2020; [ 3,4]). The simplied SARS-CoV-2 structure and its afnity with human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor is illustrated in Figure 1. Coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales, which is classied into four families, in- cluding the Coronaviridae, Mesoniviridae, Arteriviridae Roniviridae. and Torovirinae. The sub-family Coro- navirinae is in mammals only while Gamma- coronaviruses and Deltacoronaviruses are infectious in birds with some viruses infecting mammals as well [ 6]. In the 1960s, coronaviruses were discovered in humans for the rst time [ 7]. The earliest studied human viruses were the human coronavirus OC43 and 229E, both caused the common cold [ 8]. Coronaviruses also consist of emerging viruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related CoV (SARS-CoV) of Southern China (2003), the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related CoV (MERS-CoV) of Saudi Arabia (2012) [ 9,10] and SARS-CoV-2, the recently identied coronavirus in the Wuhan City of China (December, 2019) [ 11,12]. Among the coronaviruses known to infect humans, MERS- CoV , SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have the potential severe disease while OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 display mild symptoms [ 13]. SARS-CoV-2 is seventh among the coronaviruses that infect humans [14].

SARS-CoV-2 structure and its affinity with human ACE2 receptor (adopted from [15]., 2020). 2. The COVID-19 Pandemic A novel Coronavirus that recently emerged in Wuhan City, China was initially de- tected on 29 December, 2019, from four huma n cases who were all linked to the Huanan seafood market in Southern China. Patients displayed \"pneumonia of unknown etiology\" similar to the 2003 SARS. Deep sequencing of samples obtained from the patients' lower respiratory tract revealed a novel strain of coronavirus that was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [16,17]. Scientists quickly identified the causative agent as betacoronavirus [12,18,19]. Phylo- genetic analysis revealed genome nucleotides shared 89.1% nucleotide similarity with coronaviruses [18,20] previously detected in bats in China [21]. Although the virus has similarities with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, it is completely unique [11,12]. It was initially thought that the new virus may have lesser severity as compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, further evidence of a rapid upsurge in incidence and interper sonal transmission indicated that it is highly contagious [22-26]. The World Health Organization offici ally declared the outbreak caused by 2019- nCoV a pandemic on 11 March, 2020 [27] and termed the disease 'COVID-19' [11,12]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus particle has a spherical shape that exhibits some degree of pleomorphism with a diameter ranging from 60 to 140 nm, and distinct spikes 8-12 nm long [12]. SARS-CoV-2 seems well suited to bind the ACE2 human receptor with its spike protein having a polybasic (furin ) functional cleavage site that favours the attachment 12 nucleotides at the S1-S2 boundary [28]. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is the most variable portion of the CoV genome [12,18] Six amino acids in the RBD are critical for attachment to the ACE2 receptors as well as determination of host range of viruses like SARS-CoV [29]. The virus primarily spreads through the respiratory secretions of an infected person when he sneezes, coughs or talks [30]. Drople ts of the infected person can infect others when they come in contact with their mucous membranes. Droplets are typically present within a range of 2 metres (6 feet) from the in fected individual and do not last long in the air [30]. Infected surfaces can serve as a sour ce of infection too if touched with the hand Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 structure and its afnity with human ACE2 receptor (adopted from [ 15]., 2020). 2.

It was initially thought that the new virus may have lesser severity as compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV . However, further evidence of a rapid upsurge in incidence and interpersonal transmission indicated that it is highly contagious [ 22-26].

Infected surfaces can serve as a source of infection too if touched with the hand followed by touching the mouth, nose, and eyes. Symptomatic patients are believed to be most contagious [ 31]. The exact time required for virus incubation in the host is not known.Vaccines 2021 ,9, 15 3 of 16 However, it is thought to vary between 2 and 14 days post exposure to the virus, with ve days being the most common time frame [ 31-33]. The age groups most affected are the middle aged and the elderly. Children do not appear to display symptomatic infection and, if they do, it is generally mild [ 34]. A study conducted on 1099 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China revealed the following common clinical features at the disease onset: fever (88%), fatigue (38%), dry cough (67%), myalgias (14.9%) and dyspnea (18.7%). Pneumonia was found to be the most severe consequence of the infection. In patients with pneumonia, breathing difculties developed after an average of ve days [ 33].

The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients are illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 pa tients (adopted from [15]). Important similarities exist between the symptoms of COVID-19 and previous be- tacoronavirus infections including fever, dyspnea, dry cough and ground-glass opacity in CT scans of the chest [35]. However, COVID- 19 displayed some unique symptoms includ- ing sneezing, rhinorrhea and sore throat, indicating that the lower airway is being tar- geted. Moreover, chest radiographs of some cases upon admission indicated infiltrate in the lung's upper lobe that is responsible for dyspnea associated with hypoxemia [36]. 3. Vaccines and Antibodies under Clinical Trials There is a lack of precise antiviral trea tment and vaccines for COVID-19 currently [37]. However different potential vaccines and antibodies in different parts of the world are under trial, but we cannot say with certainty which vaccine and antibody will be suc- cessful and which will fail until/unless we have tested these vaccines and antibodies on a large human population. Future clinical trials of these vaccines and antibodies will deter- mine their clinical efficacy. If a vaccine be comes available for COVID-19, vaccination rate has remained an issue of concern which requires proof such as \"clear and convincing ev- idence, \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" and \"preponderance of the evidence\" on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. Several va ccines and drugs are under trial against COVID-19 [38]. Table 1 below shows information about some of the vaccines and antibod- ies currently under clinical trials. Figure 2.

Potential Drug Therapies Against COVID-19 4.1. Remdesivir Remdesivir is currently recognized as a procient antiviral drug with promising potential against a broad range of RNA virus infections (including SARS/MERS-CoV) in cell cultures, nonhuman primate (NHP) models, and mice. Clinical development of Remdesivir to treat Ebola virus infections is underway [ 60]. Remdesivir is an analogue of adenosine which integrates into the emerging chains of viral RNA and marks their pre-mature termination showed that remdesivir was functional at the post entry stage of SARS-CoV-2 virus which supports its antiviral mode of action, acting as a nucleotide analogue. In a NHP model, demonstrated that an intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg of remdesivir conferred 100% resistance to Ebola virus infection with concomitant sustained levels (10 \u0016M) in the blood. [ 61] revealed that EC90 value of this drug against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells was found to be 1.76 \u0016M, signifying its potential working concentration to be attained in NHP . Similarly, Remdesivir was also found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human cell line (liver cancer Huh-7 cells). [ 62] studied the effect of remdesivir on 53 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir was administered for 10 days with 200 mg on the rst day and 100 mg on the other nine days. Results showed improvement in 36 out of 53 patients demonstrating an efcacy of 68%. However the study lacked a control group, therefore the results remain inconclusive. More recently, WHO has issued a conditional recommendation restricting the usage of remdesivir in hospitalized individuals irrespective of disease severity since there is no current evidence that remdesivir promotes survival and recovery in patients. 4.2. Favipiravir Favipiravir is a pyrazine carboxamide derivative anti-viral drug that has been ap- proved to treat influenza in Japan. It is a prodrug, intracellularly phosphorylated and ribosylated to give ibofuranosyl-50-triphosphate (T-705-RTP) metabolite [ 63]. T-705-RTP hinders viral replication by competing with purine nucleosides and becoming incorporated into the viral RNA and thereby constraining the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [ 64]. Apart from the inhibitory effect on influenza virus, Favipiravir displays inhibition of a broad variety of RNA viruses including bun- yavirus, loviruses, falvivirus, and arenavirus that cause hemorrhagic 63]. During the Ebola outbreak in 2014-15, favipiravir showed improved survival rates in patients tested in Guinea. A retrospective study on Ebola virus disease found that patients who were treated with favipiravir in addition to WHO-recommended supportive treatment showed an overall higher survival rate and time and a >100-fold reduction in viral load [ 65]. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that it has the same RdRp gene as found in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [ 12,66,67]. Therefore, favipiravir can be considered for use against COVID-19 but recognized in vitro and animal studies are not yet available. A clin-Vaccines 2021 ,9, 15 6 of 16 ical trial to check the efcacy and safety of favipiravir was carried out on 80 patients in Shenzhen [ 68]. Results demonstrated that the viral clearance time was shorter in 35 patients who received favipiravir as compared to 45 patients who served as controls. Moreover, X-ray studies conrmed that there was a higher improvement rate in chest imaging of the favipiravir group as compared to the control group (91.43% vs. 62%) [ 68] Another randomized clinical trial of favipiravir on COVID-19 patients demonstrated an effective control with increase in seven days clinical recovery period from 55.86% to 71.43% [69]. 4.3. Lopinavir/Ritonavir A study carried out by Jian-ya et al. [ 70] on 51 patients of COVID-19 with interferon, Ritonavir, traditional medicine and Lopinavir and corticosteroids (3-5 days) resulted in successful recovery of 50 patients. Another study by Qin et al. showed that treatment with lopinavir along with interferon and moxifloxacin to non-ICU patients and administration of methylprednisolone in addition to the above drugs to treat patients in intensive care unit (ICU) resulted in the discharge of 26 patients from ICU and 16 patients from hospital [71]. Case reports on the successful treatment of COVID-19 patients with Lopinavir/Ritonavir includes a 54 year old patient who received two tablets of Lopinavir (200 mg)/Ritonavir (50 mg), 12 h apart, after 10 days of illness and resulted in the reduction of viral load which gradually became negligible. However, a recent randomized, controlled trial by Cao et al. [ 72] on 199 COVID-19 positive patients with Lopinavir-ritonavir resulted in no obvious differences between the standard care group and the treatment group which suggests that future trials are needed to exclude or conrm its efcacy. 4.4. Convalescent Plasma (CP) Therapy Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a classic approach of immunotherapy that has been in use for over a century to treat various infectious diseases. CP proved successful in treating SARS, MERS and pandemic 2009 H1N1 over the last two decades with satisfactory results [ 61,73-75]. A meta-analysis of 32 studies involving infection caused by SARS coronavirus and influenza indicated a signicant statistical pooled odds reduction in mortality with CP therapy as compared to placebo and non-treatment groups with odds ratio of 0.25%, condence interval 95%, 0.14-0.45) [76]. A recent study by Shen et al. [ 77] was carried out on ve critically sick COVID-19 patients who were receiving aided breathing through ventilators and along with antiviral therapy and methylprednisolone. Plasma transfusion to these patients resulted in normal- ization of body temperature within three days in four out of ve patients, reduction in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, increase in PAO2/FIO2 and decrease in viral load within 12 days. However, the small sample size precludes a conclusive statement about the efcacy of CP therapy. Duan et al. [ 78] conducted a study on 10 critical COVID-19 patients who were receiving antiviral agents and supportive care. A 200 mL dose of CP with above 1:640 neutralizing antibody titers obtained from recovered donors was trans- fused to these patients. CP transfusion resulted in increased neutralizing antibody levels in ve patients with four patients maintaining a high neutralizing antibody ratio (1:640). A signicant improvement in clinical symptoms without any adverse effects was observed including a rise in lymphocyte count, improvement in lung lesions, reduced C-reactive protein and increase in oxyhaemoglobin saturation within three days. However, further investigations regarding the optimal dose, time point and clinical benets are required. 5. Herbal Therapies Against COVID-19 The application of phytomedicines has increased due to their therapeutic value when compared to allopathic medicines as these bio-compounds exhibit fewer side effects [ 79]. The possibility of using plant-derived phytochemicals (particularly polyphenols) with putative active substances (e.g., flavonoids, gallates, and quercetins), which are potent agents prohibiting the proliferation of the COVID-19-inducing coronavirus has recently been reviewed by [ 80]. They can be used as pharmaceutical preparations or functional foods.Vaccines 2021 ,9, 15 7 of 16 Herbal plants of phenolic compound [ 81,82]. Biflavonoids from of SARS-CoV 3CLpro [83]. Senna L. is large genus of flowering plants in the legume family (Fabaceae) of subfamily Caesalpinioideae, comprised of 300-350 species [ 84]. It is a widespread and diverse genus. Many species of Senna are commonly used in foods and herbal medicine [ 85]. In different parts of the world, the whole Senna alata plant is currently being used in the treatment of flu, fever, malaria, and large number of other medical conditions due to the presence of bioactive compounds in the plant, including quinones, alkaloids, and terpenes [ 86-90]. The leaf extract of Senna alata considerably inhibited 3D7 strain of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in vitro [87,88]. Recently, it was determined that use of an aqueous extract obtained after boiling of 5 g of Senna leaves in 500 mL water for 10 min provided relief from virus symptoms in COVID-19 patients (unpublished data). After boiling, it is recommended that half of the aqueous leaf extract can be used immediately while the second half can be used after 8-10 h to avoid toxicity. In the intervening time, water taken frequently can avoid toxicity. In order to avoid the bitter taste of aqueous leaf extract, honey can be added, which has also an antimicrobial effect. As Senna alata plants are currently being used to treat different medical conditions in different parts of world, including Africa and Asia, there is a need to conrm Senna leaf aqueous extracts in COVID-19 patients as a herbal therapy. Lianhuaqingwen (LH), a Traditional Chinese Medicine formula composed of a combina- tion of 13 herbs was shown to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and changed the morphology of SARS-CoV-2 cells [ 90]. These herbs are presented in Table 2. [ 91] demonstrated that LH also has a comparable antiviral potency against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro . It was noteworthy that transmission electron mi- croscopy (TEM) revealed that the number of virus particles in infected patients was greatly reduced in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 that were treated with LH at 600 \u0016g/mL. LH is widely used for a variety of respiratory virus infections, including influenza virus. The pre- cise mechanism of action of LH to reduce virus infection remains unknown, although it has been shown to also reduce cytokine release from infected cells, suggesting that multiple levels of action are taking place. Table 2. Herbs involved in Lianhuaqingwen, used in traditional Chinese medicine to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication. Common Name Scientic Name Chinese (Thunb.) Sh \u00afan x\u00ecng Chinese health authorities in 23 out of 31 provinces have issued herbal remediy programs to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The top two herbal formulas used were Radix astragali (Huangqi) studyVaccines 2021 ,9, 15 8 of 16 recommends the use of tender leaf of Toona sinensis Roem, a popular Chinese vegetable that is already used safely. In vitro studies show that the tender leaf of Toona sinensis Roem, can inhibit SARS-CoV [93]. It is expected to also block SARS-CoV-2. As mentioned above, licorice root has some bioactive properties, including antitu- moral, antiinflammatory, and antiviral effects on health. Glycyrrhizic acid (glycyrrhizin, GL) and its aglycone glycyrrhetinic acid (GLA) are active against a broad spectrum of viruses, including herpes viruses, flaviviruses, Hepatitis C virus, human immunodeciency virus, and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in vitro . Virus inhibition has been demonstrated in Vero cells and in patients [ 35,94-96]. Further dissection of glycyrrhizic acid indicated that sugar moieties are responsible for the anti-SARS activity, as a replacement of these with functional groups resulted in a loss in activity. Earlier studies using herbs to block SARS could also successfully inhibit SARS-CoV2 infection. For example, Wen et al., 2011 [ 97] examined extracts of over 50 traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) herbs on anti-SARS-CoV activity using a Vero E6 cell-based cytopathogenic effect (CPE) assay. The authors were able to demonstrate that six novel herbal extracts may be used as potential SARS drug targets. The herbal extracts were derived from Rhizoma cibotii all of them inhibited SARS-CoV replication, and two inhibited virus protease activity. Studies using phlorotannins isolated from the edible brown algae Ecklonia cava found that several of these bioactive compounds were able to inhibit SARS-CoV activity by functioning as protease inhibitors. One of these, dieckol, had the most potent antiviral activity; this took place through competitive binding at the catalytic site of the protease [ 98]. It is feasible that dieckol would also have an inhibitory effect against SARS-2. 6. Plant Molecular Pharming to Combat COVID-19 Plants are being used for the production of recombinant vaccines and drugs for more than 30 years and the whole process is described under term 'molecular farming' [99,100] . Secondary metabolites functions in plants; partic- ularly advantageous is their role in chemical defense because of their antioxidative and antimicrobial activities. Thus, molecular farming is used for the large-scale production of valuable secondary metabolites. In addition, metabolic engineering tools can be used to overwhelm the bioactive-compounds availability limitations from medicinal plants and to improve the productivity benecial from both bioprocessing and molecular farming [ 101] The synthesis of desirable recombinant proteins (pharmaceuticals and industrial proteins) using whole plants or in vitro cultured plant tissues/cells in large-scale bioreactors is termed molecular farming. The advantages of plant-based reactors have been described in a review of molecular farming by Mohammadinejad et al. [ 101] as follows: (i) lower cost in maintenance; (ii) lower risks of contamination from animal pathogens; (iii) competence to implement modications in eukaryotic post-translational machinery function; and (iv) being amenable to the large-scale manufacturing process. Vaccines generated in plants have been shown to elicit a robust immune response in humans and animals (Figure 3). Plants have a great ability to act as a bioreactor system that supports many important biological processes including virus-like particles (VLPs) and vaccines. Transformation of plants with foreign genes leads to protein drugs, vaccines, and antibodies against different human pathogens hence plants make it easy to deal with safe, inexpensive, and provide trouble-free storage of protein vaccines and drugs [ 102]. Many research studies and clinical trials have shown that plant-made vaccines are safe and efcacious [ 103,104]. Examples of plant-made vaccines and therapeutics produced by molecular pharming include vaccines to combat cholera, Dengue fever virus and Hepatitis B virus, monoclonal antibodies to HIV and Ebola virus, and a therapeutic agent to provide glucocerebrosidase and help Gaucher Disease patients [ 104,105]. Several plant pharming companies and research labs have taken up the challenge to combat COVID-19. At the same time, there is a dramatic shortage of COVID-19 tests that could be alleviated byVaccines 2021 ,9, 15 9 of 16 producing diagnostic agents in plants [ 106]. A few examples of vaccines, diagnostics for test kits and antiviral therapeutics are presented in the following section. Vaccines 2021 , 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 16 Figure 3. Schematic diagram of plant pharming. Medicago, a biopharmaceutical company ba sed in Canada, has successfully devel- oped a virus-like particle (VLP) of the coronavirus 20 days after obtaining the SARS-CoV- 2 genetic sequence. Instead of using egg-based methods to develop vaccines, this technol- ogy inserts a genetic sequence encoding the spike protein of COVID-19 into Agrobacterium , a common soil bacterium that is taken up by plants [107]. The resulting plants that are developed produce a virus like particle that is composed of a plant lipid membrane and COVID-19 spike protein. Medicago is using the plant Nicotiana benthamiana , a close rela- tive of the tobacco produce VLPs of the SARS-CoV2 virus (COVID-19: Medi- cago's Development Programs). The VLPs are similar in size and shape to actual corona- virus but are lacking in nucleic acid and are, thus, noninfectious. Medicago has success- fully completed its Phase 1 clinical trials and is currently working on Phase 2 clinical trials [108]. Previously, Medicago has made VLPs composed of influenza virus haemagglutinin, and have demonstrated their safety and efficacy in animal models as well as in human clinical trials [109]. The cost of producing a plant-made vaccine based on VLPs is a small fraction compared to its conventional counterpart [110]. In Canada, the University of Western Ontario and Suncor are developing diagnostic test kits for COVID-19 using algae as a production factory to make the viral spike proteins [111]. Algae has long been considered a pote ntial platform for generating pharmaceutical proteins as well as industrial proteins, such as cellulases [112]. Algae is a superior biofac- tory alternative because it is easy to grow an d can be readily modified to produce the viral proteins. Figure 3. Schematic diagram of plant pharming. Medicago, a biopharmaceutical company based in Canada, has successfully developed a virus-like particle (VLP) of the coronavirus 20 days after obtaining the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence. Instead of using egg-based methods to develop vaccines, this technology inserts a genetic sequence encoding the spike protein of COVID-19 into Agrobacterium , a common soil bacterium that is taken up by plants [ 107]. The resulting plants that are developed produce a virus like particle that is composed of a plant lipid membrane and COVID-19 spike protein. Medicago is using the plant Nicotiana benthamiana , a close relative of the tobacco plant, to produce VLPs of the SARS-CoV2 virus (COVID-19: Medicago's Development Programs). The VLPs are similar in size and shape to actual coronavirus but are lacking in nucleic acid and are, thus, noninfectious. Medicago has successfully completed its Phase 1 clinical trials and is currently working on Phase 2 clinical trials [ 108]. Previously, Medicago has made VLPs composed of influenza virus haemagglutinin, and have demonstrated their safety and efcacy in animal models as well as in human clinical trials [109]. The cost of producing a plant-made vaccine based on VLPs is a small fraction compared to its conventional counterpart [110].

Algae has long been considered a potential platform for generating pharma-Vaccines 2021 ,9, 15 10 of 16 ceutical proteins as well as industrial proteins, such as cellulases [ 112]. Algae is a superior biofactory alternative because it is easy to grow and can be readily modied to produce the viral proteins. British American Tobacco, through its biotech subsidiary in the US, Kentucky Bio- Processing (KBP), is developing a potential vaccine for COVID-19 and is currently un- dergoing pre-clinical testing [ 113]. Experts at KBP cloned a part of the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, which they used to develop a potential antigen that was inserted into Nicotiana benthamiana plants for production. The vaccine has elicited a positive immune response by pre-clinical testing and will be onto Phase 1 human clinical trials soon [ 114]. BAT could manufacture as much as 1-3 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine per week (they made 10 million vaccines of flu in a month as well as an Ebola vaccine using the same plant-based approach) [115]. South African company Cape Bio Pharms (CBP) is also responding to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through the production of reagents in plants, which could be used for diagnostic kits [ 116]. CBP is producing SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 reagents consisting of various regions of the glycoprotein attached to various fusion proteins. The company, based in Cape Town South Africa, is also collaborating with antibody manufacturers to produce antibodies against these proteins [116]. Another example of a plant molecular pharmed solution to COVID-19 is taking place in the department of nanoengineering at the University of California, San Diego. Researchers in Nicole Steinmetz' lab have been using Cowpea mosaic virus like particles, with B- and T-cell epitopes from the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 displayed on their icosahedral surfaces [117]. The recombinant virus harboring these COVID-19 epitopes can be applied in the form of an implanted microneedle technology incorporating VLP vaccines to skin and will elicit an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 [118]. The Steinmetz research group have recently developed positive control probes, com- posed of Cowpea mosaic virus-like particles, to be used as COVID-19 diagnostics and improve the accuracy of COVID-19 tests. The researchers hope that these positive controls, which are stable at room temperature for prolonged periods of time and cheap to generate, could be useful in resource-poor settings [32]. Another collaboration between two research groups in Toronto, Canada, has brought about a novel way to ght COVID-19 using a synthetic peptide that binds to the viral deu- biquitinase (DUB) and is carried by a plant virus. The work initially began by examining the role of the virus protease, located in ORF 1a of the coronavirus genome responsible for the related MERS virus. This protease contains a deubiquitinase activity as a means of protecting the virus from the innate immune system of the cell. Ubiquitin is a protein found in eukaryotic cells that play an important role in the regulation of proteins. It labels unwanted proteins (poorly folded proteins, viral proteins) to be degraded by the protea- some into shorter fragments or amino acids that can be recycled for cellular metabolism. Some viruses, such as coronavirus, express deubiquitinases (DUBs) to prevent destruction by the cell. A synthetic peptide of approximately 80 amino acids and known as a ubiquitin variant (UbV) was created by phage display library design and shown to bind tightly to MERS DUB at its ubiquitin binding site, thus blocking its deubiquitinase activity as well as its proteolytic activity (Figure 4). This synthetic UbV was shown to block MERS virus infection in a human cell line, using a lentivirus vector for cell entry [ 119]. An analog to this UbV , which selectively binds to the DUB of SARS-CoV2, has recently been engineered for use in the current pandemic [ 120]. Both MERS and COVID-19 UbVs have been fused to the N-terminus of the coat protein of a plant virus expression vector known as Papaya mosaic potexvirus (PaMV) (unpublished results). The UbV:CP fusion protein can assemble into virus like particles. PaMV has previously been shown to enter human cells via vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein. The virus nanoparticle, loaded with COVID-19 UbV , can enter cells and block virus infection. Potexvirus nanoparticles have been shown to successfully enter the epithelial cells of lungs when introduced in the form of an aerosol spray. It isVaccines 2021 ,9, 15 11 of 16 possible that these VLPs can be loaded into an inhaler to treat the lungs of infected and uninfected patients. The ubiquitin variant is also being produced in a plant geminivirus vector, to be puried as an antiviral for COVID-19 patients (Manuscript in preparation). Geminiviruses, such as Bean yellow dwarf virus, have been engineered to produce large amounts of pharmaceutical proteins from plants in relatively short periods of time [ 121]. A novel synthetic antibody to COVID-19 that was engineered from a phage display library is also currently being examined using the geminivirus vector system [122]. Vaccines 2021 , 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 16 preparation).

As a result of the current COVID- 19 pandemic, therapies such as Remdes ivir, convalescent plasma (CP), and Senna leaf ex- tracts are the best available against COVID-19, until we have vaccine candidates in hand which have successfully undergone laboratory experiments, animal trials, and all phases (1-3) of clinical trials. Possible targets including the spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, en- velope, viral RNA polymerase, and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro), which cleaves the virus polyprotein at 11 distinct sites to generate various non-stru ctural proteins that are important for viral replication, are all being used to develop potential vaccines and antiviral drugs. Virus like particles (VLPs) of SARS-CoV-2 may act as promising vaccines because they have the potential to activate the human immune response in a fashion sim- ilar to the original virus. There is need to explore plant-based systems to check whether VLPs with retained structure and in sufficient quantity can be generated in these systems [123]. On the one hand, this can include the furthe r refinement of herbal extracts, particularly ones that had been used in the past to successfully inhibit SARS-CoV, as they may also function to block SARS- CoV-2. The use of attenuated viruses and viral vectors in humans as vaccines may pose certain health risks involving the possibility of mutation (in the case of attenuated viruses) and recombination (in the case of vi ral vectors). The develo pment of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may also not be a long-term solution due to potential ad- verse reactions. Thus VLPs of SARS-CoV-2 generated by a plant expression system may act as a viable vaccine for the future.
