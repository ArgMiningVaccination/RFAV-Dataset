Introduction Breastcancerremainstobetheleadingcauseofcancerdeath amongwomenworldwidewiththerateofreportedincidenceand mortality increasing annually [ 1,2]. In the past decade, women with tumors between stages I and II increased from41% to 65%, 80% of which are invasive tumors originatingfrom ductal carcinoma and its variants [ 3]. Current early detectionmethodsallowbreastcancertobediagnosedatanearlystagewhensuccessfultreatmentismorelikely.Multipleagencies and organizations around the world support mam-mography as the most reliable way to detect breast cancer atanearlystage,particularlyinwomenaged50yearsandolder[4,5]. About 70% of breast cancers express estrogen hor- mone receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR), andthese markers along with human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 (HER-2) and proliferation marker Ki-67 provideinformation about tumor grade and possible response todifferent treatments [ 6]. Although several treatment options are currently available including surgery, radiation therapy,and chemotherapy, specific treatment strategies depend on characteristicssuchastumorgrade,hormonereceptorstatus,metastatic potential, and molecular and patient profile [ 7]. Chemotherapy is still the most commonly used and recom-mended treatment option for breast cancer, either by usinga single compound or combination therapy with multipledrugs [8]. However, chemotherapeutic drugs have narrow therapeutic indices resulting in nonselective toxic effects onnormaltissues,thusincreasingtheriskofinfection.Althoughchemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective against breastcancer,theyareaccompaniedbyvariedsideeffectsincludingvasomotor syndrome (occurring in up to of hot flushes, and psychological stress, which presentmajorhurdlesinincreasingtheeffectivenessofcancertherapy[7-10]. Palliative care is an important aspect of cancer therapy that centers on the relief of pain and other symptomsrelated to cancer and its treatment. It aims to improve the 2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine patient'squalityoflife(QOL)andcanbeadministeredalong with curative treatment. Pharmacological interventions thatreduceorpreventadversesideeffectsandincreasechemosen-sitivity may have a substantial impact on cancer treatmentand palliative care. Though the use of complementary andalternativemedicine(CAM)bycancerpatientsisnotpartof conventional cancer palliative care regimens in some coun- tries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO),80% of cancer patients use CAM, in one form or another,for these purposes [ 11]. According to the WHO definition, t h et e r mC A Mi su s e di n t e r c h a n g e a b l yw i t h\" t r a d i t i o n a lmedicine\" and refers to a broad set of health care practices,includingtraditionalChinesemedicine(TCM),acupuncture,herbalpreparations,vitamins,homeopathicremedies,musictherapy, and other psychological, physical, and spiritualtechniques [ 12-14]. The effectiveness of CAM is primarily basedonempiricalevidenceandcasestudieshowever,intherecent years, the increasing amount of supporting data fromcontrolledclinicaltrialsrelatingCAMusetooverallqualityoflifeandsafetyhasdramaticallyincreased[ 15-17].Thesesup- portivemeasuresaresupposedtocontrolsymptoms,improveQOL, boost the immune system, decrease cytotoxicity tonormalcells,andpossiblyprolonglife[ importanttonotethattheintegrationofCAMintopalliativecare and cancer treatment regimens is One multicenter study that reported oncology profes- sionals' attitude towards CAM concluded that in Europeancountries, for example, CAM therapies commonly includemistletoe extracts, vitamin supplementation, and phytoe-strogens, and only an approximately 4% of Scandinavian healthpractitioners,incontrasttothe20%Germandoctors, b e l i e v et h a tC A Mu s eh a sap o s i t i v er o l ei na d j u v a n tt r e a t -ment of cancer patients [ 22]. Traditional oriental medicine systems (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Ayurvedic), spiritu-alism, hypnosis, aromatherapy, and acupuncture representthe widespread use of these CAM practices in the region[23]. In particular, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan operate a two-tiered medical system of integrativemedicine, and CAM is fully integrated into national health,education, and insurance policies [ 16,24,25]. On the other hand, though not integrated in current oncological practice,16% to 63% of North American cancer patients are reportedtocommonlyuseacupuncture,hypnosis,andspiritualism,aswell as vitamin therapies and botanicals. In one populationsurvey, 75% agreed that combining conventional medicaltreatment and CAM was preferable to using either alone[26,27]. The apparent widespread use of CAM worldwide andits(erroneousorotherwise)associationwithminimalorzero risk means that there is a significant need to do furthers t u d i e st og a i na nu n d e r s t a n d i n go ft h ep h a r m a c o d y n a m i cinteractions between chemotherapeutic drugs and herbalcomponents and the effects of either component and dosingregimensincancertreatmentandpalliativecare[ 28,29]. Among cancer patients, CAM is used more frequently by breast cancer patients with an estimated use by 45% of patients across different treatment stages [ 30,31]. In one survey done among long-term breast cancer survivors (onaverage, 8.7 years after-diagnosis), more than 50% believedthat CAM use could prevent cancer recurrence (69%), playan active role in recovery (67%), and help to manage stress (64%) [32]. Evidence gathered from recent randomized control trials (RCTs) demonstrates that herbal medicinesand chemopreventive phytochemicals in combination withchemotherapeutic agents are effective in sensitizing cancercells to treatment and minimizing the side effects arising from conventional therapy, thus increasing patient survival rate and QOL [ 18,33-40]. In addition to herbal medicine, acupuncture has also become a popular complementarytreatment in oncology, particularly as patients seek non-pharmacologicalalternativestoprovidesymptomcontrol.Areview of recent RCTs of acupuncture in oncology suggeststhat it has a promising role in controlling a wide varietyof cancer and treatment-related symptoms. The evidencecurrently available suggests that acupuncture is a safe, lowcost, and effective therapy, which further permits cancerpatientstoactivelyparticipateintheirowncareplan[ 41]. Several reviews had been done in the past on the use of either herbal medicine or acupuncture [ 42-47]; however, a comprehensive review of clinical trials utilizing eitherof these CAM methods in palliative care of breast cancerpatients had not been done yet. This review focuses on theuse of herbal medicine treatments, either as single herbsor combinations, and acupuncture in palliative care and asadjuvantsincombinationwithchemo-orradiotherapyinthetreatment of breast cancer based on recently conducted orcompletedRCTs.Thecorrelationbetweenclinicaluse, invitro mechanistic and in vivoanimal studies of herbal medicine, and the effectiveness of acupuncture with the use of certainacupoints in breast cancer patients is summarized and is aimed at facilitating an understanding of current practices involving the use of herbal medicine and acupuncture asadjuvantsinbreastcancertherapy. 2. Methods An electronic search for previously published articleswas conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Database, theUS National Center for Complementary and AlternativeMedicine (NCCAM) ( http://www.nccam.nih.gov/ ), and Health ( http://www.clinicaltrials .gov/) databases to find relevant studies published up until February2013(inclusive).Thesearchincludedthefollowingspecific medical subject heading (MeSH) terms: breastcancer, AND/OR breast neoplasms, AND/OR adjuvant chemo/radiotherapies,AND/ORherbalmedicine,AND/OR acupuncture, AND/OR acupuncture points in addition torelevant text keywords comprising the following words incombination: cancer palliative care, traditional Chinesemedicine, herbal formulation, phytoagent, and acupoints.The article or study types were limited to clinical trials(Phases I to IV), controlled clinical trials, and randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs). The titles and abstracts of allretrievedcitationswerereadandanalyzed.Intotal,90RCTs,either completed or ongoing, were included regardless ofblinding. The most common phytoagents, single herbaltreatments, herbal formulations, and acupoints used in theretrieved RCTs were singled out. Moreover, an exhaustiveEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 search for references regarding in vivoandin vitrostudies pertaining to mechanistic actions, acupuncture practices,individual acupoints, treatment-related symptoms, andassociatedeffectswasconducted. Furthermore,theherbalmedicineandacupunctureprac- ticesincludedinthemostrecentRCTsarehighlightedinthis review because these are generally accepted as constituting the most reliable evidence of treatment effects [ 48,49]. RCTsincludeexperimentswhereinindividualsarerandomlyallocated to receive or not receive experimental preventive,therapeutic, or diagnostic procedure; they are then followedover a given time period to determine the effects.

Results and Discussion 3.1. Herbal Medicines as Adjuvant Treatment in Breast Can-cer Chemotherapy. The most common complaint among patients receiving chemotherapy treatment is fatigue, whichis experienced by 80% to 96% of the patient mucositis and myelosuppres- sion, by almost 40% of patients, are the com-mon, dose-limiting, and costly side effects of cancer ther-apy [51]. Moreover, cytotoxic chemotherapy suppresses the system andlimitingthedosesofdrugsthatcanbetoleratedbythepatient[52].Table 1summarizes the conventional/approved drugs usedinbreastcancerchemotherapytogetherwiththeirmajormechanisms of action and most commonly observed sideeffects [50-63]. Several drugs have been used in combina- tion,forexample,cisplatin-methotrexatefluorouracil(CMF),fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide and FEC-tamoxifen (FEC-T), supposedly to increase efficacy pression alongside long-term side effects including ovarian failure,weightgain,cardiacdysfunction,and,insomecases,leukemia[ r ewidel 3.1.1. Traditional Chinese Medicines Composed of Multiple Herbs.In traditional medicinal systems, herbal medicines a r eu s e do ft e nt ot r e a tt h es y m p t o m sa s s o c i a t e dw i t hc a n c e rand the side effects of cancer treatment [ 68]. Herbal formu- lations used in TCM include mixtures of herbal compoundsconstituted as decoctions, tea, injections, or capsules, whicharepurportedtopossessanticancercompoundsandareusedalone or as adjuvants to existing chemotherapy regimens toimprove efficacy and/or reduce drug-induced toxicity [ 69]. Although TCM is commonly used to counteract the sideeffects of chemotherapy, scientific evidence for its use in womenwithbreastcancerstillisbeingcollected.Amongthe mostcommonChinesemedicinalherbformulationsusedin preclinical and clinical practice for breast cancer treatment are Danggui ( Angelica sinensis -radix) and Ren Shen ( are reported to have potential bene- ficial synergistic effects that include decreasing treatment-associated toxicity, psychosocial stress, and fatigue [ 70]. Jia-wei-xiao-yao-san, commercially known as \"Augmented Rambling Powder,\" a Chinese medicinal herb formulationcontaining Danggui, is the most frequently prescribed for- mula for treating breast cancer and chemotherapy-related symptomsbyTCMpractitionersinTaiwan.Thisformulationhas a long history of use for alleviation of blood toxicity and s l e e pd i s t u r b a n c e .I ti sa l s ou s e dt or e l i e v eh o tfl u s h e sa n d lowerserumlevelsofinflammatorycytokines,IL-6,IL-8,and macrophageprotein1-[71,72]. LSC101, an encapsulated homogenized mixture of dry powdered extracts from a combination of medicinal herbs, littoralis, is used widely by breast cancer patients. Its efficacy in atten- uating the hematological complications of chemotherapyh a sb e e nt e s t e di nc l i n i c a ls e t t i n g s[ 70]. In mouse breast cancer models, the use of LSC101 together with doxorubicinl e dt os i g n i fi c a n t l yh i g h e rn e u t r o p h i l ,s p l e n i ce r y t h r o c y t e ,and leukocyte counts [ 71]. In addition, the use of LCS101 together with conventional chemotherapy regimens pro- vided protection against mild to moderate chemotherapy-induced anemia and neutropenia, supporting its use fordecreasing hematological toxicity but not cancer prevention[73]. Though it is not yet clear how the compounds in LCS101 reduce hematological toxicity, it is suspected thatthe interactions and synergistic effects of the active com-pounds from the combination of herbs may be responsiblefor the pronounced efficacy [ 74]. Some of the component herbs, for example, Ophiopogon japonicus andAstragalus membranaceus, inLSC101havebeenindependentlyshownto stimulatetheproductionoferythroidprogenitorcellsinmiceand in patientsw i t hc h r o n i ca p l a s t i ca n e m i a[ 75]. A TCM formulation composedoffiveherbs,commonlyknownas\"Ruyiping\"and\"Runing II,\" is used as treatment for detoxification and pre-venting relapse, recurrence, and metastasis in breast cancerpatients after mastectomy [ 76]. Clinical evidence suggests that the mechanism of action of this herbal formulation isviainhibitionofangiogenesisanddownregulationofvascularendothelialgrowthfactor(VEGF)andVEGFreceptoraswellas microvessel count (MVC) and micro-vessel area (MVA)[75,76]. ShenqiFuzhengInjection(SFI),aTCMformulationused in repairing immune function at the cellular and molecular levels, is also effective in alleviating myelosuppression andGI tract reaction induced dendritic cellsand upregulating costimulatory molecules [ 77,78]. Clinical studies using a natural dietary supplement composed of a combination of medicinal mushrooms Coriolus versicolor , ,a n Curcuma longa suggested that the formula can alleviate chemotherapy-inducedtoxicityinliver,spleen,kidney,lung,and heart tissue [ 79].In vitrostudies also elucidated the mechanism of action of this mushroom-herbal formulationininhibitingproliferationandloweringtheinvasivebehaviorof a highly metastatic human cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, by the inhibition of cyclin A1 expression and by used in TCM treatmentsfor breast cancer and is associated with immunomodulationbased and wound-healing propertiesattributedtothesynergisticactivityofthecomponentsoftheherbs[82].InoneRCT,RG-CHMinterventionimprovedthe immunecellcountofcancerpatientsreceivingchemotherapy and/or radiotherapy preventing leukopenia and immune impairment associated with a decrease in levels of T cells,helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and natural killer cells com-paredwiththegroupreceivingplacebotreatment.However,the differences between the two groups were not statisticallysignificant [ 83]. The results did show, however, that the administrationofRG-CMHtopatientsreceivingchemother-apy/radiotherapydelayedthereductioninlevelsofleucocytesand neutrophils u l e sh a v eb e e ns h o w nt ob e n e fi tt h ec i r c u l a - tory system through vasodilation, immunomodulation, andantidementiaactivities[ 85].ResultsofarecentRCTshowedthattheabsolutecountsofT-helperlymphocytes(CD4+),the B lymphocytes were significantly elevated in patientsaftertakingYunzhi-Danshencapsules.Theseclinicalfindings imply that regular oral consumption of Yunzhi-Danshen capsules could be beneficial for promoting immunologicalfunction in breast cancer patients after chemotherapy [ 85, 86]. These findings were also supported by in vitroresults showingthatYunzhi-Danshentreatmentinhibitedcancercellproliferation by cell-cycle arrest and downregulation of Aktphosphorylation cells, a human breast cancer cellline,andbyinducingapoptosis[ 87,88]. 3.1.2. Single Herbs and Medicinal Mushrooms.

Since breast cancer chemotherapeutics such as cytostatics,aromatase inhibitors, or antiestrogens frequently induce oraggravate preexisting menopausal symptoms, extracts of C. racemosa are currently being explored as an adjuvant. The mechanisms of action of this phytotherapeutic herb arestill not totally understood, but there is growing interestin its usefulness in the treatment of vasomotor symptomsand hot flushes and in preventing the decrease in bone densityassociatedwithmenopause[ 93,94].Theuseofblack cohosh in clinical trials as an adjuvant to chemotherapy wasobserved to help patients improve their QOL through reliefof vasomotor symptoms [ 95,96 ]. Moreover, in vitrostudies using MCF7 cells showed the high antitumor activity ofC. racemosa extracts their involvement in induction Coriolus versicolor (Yunzhi) also known as Trametes versicolor is a popular component in TCM mushroom preparations. Several clinical trials with patients receivingchemotherapyorradiotherapyhavefoundthatencapsulatedYunzhi preparations significantly improve appetite, alleviateweakness, anorexia, vomiting, dryness of the throat, andEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 spontaneous or night sweats and pain, increase weight, stabilize white blood cell counts, NK cells, IL-2 levels, andCD4/CD8 ratio, and demonstrate a a unique protein-bound polysaccharide, which has been used as a chemoimmunotherapy agent. Several RCTs have demonstrated the efficacy of PSK as anadjuvant in cancer therapy, with positive results seen in theadjuvant treatment of gastric, esophageal, colorectal, breast,and lung cancers. PSK is a biological response modifier(BRM) that improves the ability of cancer patients to fightoff tumor progression through different mechanisms, mostprobably by leukocyte activation, regulation of IFN- and IL-2 levels, and inhibition of metalloproteinases and otherenzymes involved in metastatic activity [ 101-105]. PSK has further been shown to have antioxidant activity which mayallow it to play a role as a normal tissue chemo- andradioprotector when used in combination with adjuvant ordefinitive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in the treat-mentofcancersandmayalsoenableittodefendthehostfromoxidativestress[ 106]. Ganoderma Lucidum ,a l s ok n o w na sL i n g z h i ,i su s e di n TCM to promote health and increase life expectancy [ 137]. Clinically, the spore powder is used to treat cancer-relatedfatigue in breast cancer patients undergoing endocrine ther-apy.Patientsgiventhetreatmentreportedimprovedphysicalwell-being, less fatigue, less anxiety and depression, andoverall better QOL. Comparative evaluation of TNF- ,I L - 6 ,a n dl i v e ra n dk i d n e yf u n c t i o nb e f o r ea n da ft e ri n t e r - ventions showed a statistically significant effect [ 138]. The wide spectrum of biological effects reported for G. lucidum in the prevention of chronic diseases, such as hepatitis,hepatopathy,andhypertension,makesitaviableadjuvantforhepatoprotection in cancer therapy [ 139]. Among the active compoundspresentin G. lucidum extracts,triterpenoidsare one of the main components responsible for the pharma-cologicalactivitiesincludingimmunomodulatory,antioxida-tive, antimetastatic, and antitumor effects [ 140].In Ginseng ( Panax Ginseng ) is one of the most well-known herbal remedies and is used in TCM to proactively promotehealth,vitality,andlongevity.Ginsengisrankedasthefourthtop-selling herbal medicine globally [ 142,143]. In recent years, ginseng has been included in the pharmacopoeiaso fG e r m a n y ,A u s t r i a ,t h eU n i t e dK i n g d o m ,a n dt h eU n i t e dStates. In adjuvant breast cancer therapy, ginseng has beenused to maintain natural energy, increase physical andpsychomotor performance, and improve mood and evidence from epidemiologic, studies has revealed an inverse-relationshipbetweenincreasedintakeofgreentea( Camelliasinensis )andrelativeriskforbreastcancer[ 147].Greenteaextractpolyphe- non (EGCG) was supplemented as decaffeinatedgreen tea capsules for 2 months in a double-blind, ran-domized,andplacebo-controlledinterventionstudy.Resultssuggest the beneficial effects of EGCG on LDL-cholesterol concentrations and glucose-related markers [ 148]. Since green tea has been associated with weight control andcardiovascular disease prevention, its effect on weight gainafter breast cancer treatment was also investigated [ 149]. A slight reduction in body weight and improved HDL andglucose homeostasis was seen in overweight breast cancersurvivors.Theseclinicalfindings,togetherwithsubstantial in vitroandinvivoevidence,suggestthatteapolyphenolscanbe used as chemopreventive agents and 149-151 ]. Mistletoe ( Viscum album ) extracts have been used for cancer therapy since the early 1920s, most commonly incentral Europe [ 152,153]. Most recent clinical studies have focused on the use of mistletoe extracts as adjuvants forchemotherapy specifically for nausea/vomiting and the sideeffects of systemic therapy [ 154]. The active compounds in mistletoe treatment are the recently identified mistletoelectins (ML I, II, and III) that consist of two polypeptidechains: a carbohydrate-binding B chain that can bind to cellsurface receptors enabling the protein to enter the cell, andthecatalyticAchain,whichcansubsequentlyinhibitproteinsynthesis, due to its ribosome-inactivating properties [ 155, 156].Otherpharmacologicallyrelevantcompoundsfoundin mistletoe are viscotoxins and other low molecular proteins, oligo- and polysaccharides, flavonoids, and triterpene acids, which have been found to act synergistically resulting int h ec y t o t o x i ca n da p o p t o s i s - i n d u c i n ge ff e c t so ft h ew h o l eplant extract [ 157,158]. One RCT showed that mistletoe preparations boosted the immune system in low doses,helping to improve the QOL and survival of some cancerpatients by as much as 40% alongside cotreatment withchemo- and radiotherapy. These pathways[159-162]. Rhodiola algida is widely used TCM stimulate the immune system. Oral ulcerative mucositis, a commonadverse effect of mainstream cytotoxic drugs, limits thenutritional intake of cancer patients. One clinical studydemonstrated the effects of R. algida in alleviation of the occurrence of oral ulcers after four cycles of chemotherapyusing 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and tak-ingR. algida extracts. While white blood cell (WBC) levels returned to the normal range a week after every cycle ofchemotherapy,WBCcountincreasedfasterinpatientsusing R.algida.Patientsalsopresentedfewerandsmalleroralulcers and no liver or renal complications were observed in anyo ft h ep a t i e n t si n v o l v e di nt h es t u d y .Th u s R. algida has the potential to be used concurrently with chemotherapy toalleviatetheoccurrenceoforalulcers[ 163-165].6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine Several flavonoids with cytotoxic activity have been isolated from the aqueous extract of the aerial part ofScutellaria barbata . Despite identification of several active chemicalcompounds,nonedemonstratedmorepotentcyto-toxic activity than the whole plant extract. Thus, the wholeherb extract is being used and studied clinically [ 166- 168]. In one multicenter, open-label, and dose-escalation phase 1B clinical trial, S. barbata extract was administered orally, once or twice daily on a continuous basis to womenwith advanced metastatic breast cancer (MBC) receivingchemotherapy. decreasedincluding aspartate transferase (AST) elevation, diarrhea,fatigue, and pain, proving this herb to be effective and safea n dt h u ss h o w i n gp r o m i s ei nt h et r e a t m e n to fs i d ee ff e c t srelated to the treatment of women with MBC [ 169].

In addition to its antioxidant properties, U. tomentosa modulates the activity of the immune system by proliferation of normal T and Blymphocytesandmodulationofcertaincytokines,includingIL-1,IL-6,andTNF-[182-184]. 3.2.UseofAcupunctureinBreastCancer 3.2.1. Definition and Concept of Acupuncture. The National InstitutesofHealth(NIH),USA,hasdefinedacupunctureasa family of procedures involving stimulation of anatomicallocations on the skin by a variety of techniques. The moststudiedmechanismofstimulationofacupuncturepointsusespenetration of the skin by thin, solid, and metallic needles,whichar emani p ula tedman uallyo rb yelectricalstim ula tio n[185]. The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that bodily functions are regulated by an energycalled \"qi\" which flows through the body; disruptions ofthis flow may cause disease [ 186]. Traditional acupunctur- ists understand qi as circulating between the organs alongchannels called meridians, which are classified as yin oryangmeridians[ 187].Yinmeridiansincludethelung,spleen, heart, kidney, pericardium, and liver, while yang meridiansinclude the stomach, large intestines, small intestines, blad- der, triple energizer, and gall bladder [ 188,189]. Qi energy must flow in the correct strength and quality through eachof these meridians and organs for health to be maintained.ThroughoutthehistoryofChinesemedicineanddescriptionsinHuangdiNeijing ,theconceptofbalancingyinandyanghad beenextensivelyappliedintheapplicationofcombinationofmeridians,correspondingorgans,andacupuncturepointsoracupoints [ 188,189]. Acupoints are mainly (but not always) foundatspecificlocationsalongthemeridianswhichprovideonemeansofalteringtheflowofqi.Therearealsoanumberof acupuncture points with specified locations outside themeridians; these are called \"extraordinary\" points and areoften credited with special therapeutic properties. A thirdcategoryofacupuncturepointscalled\"A-shi\"pointshavenofixedlocationbutrepresenttenderorreflexivepointsappear-ing in the course of pain syndromes [ 188]. Acupuncture points are thought to correspond to conventional (Western)physiologicalandanatomicalfeatures,suchastheperipheralnerve junctions, and are known to stimulate the release ofneurotransmitters, partially explaining its effect particularlyinpainmanagement[ 189]. 3.2.2. Scientific Exploration into Acupuncture. Acupuncture is aimed at correcting imbalances in the flow of qi by stimu- lation of acupoints by a variety of techniques which involvesthe insertion of fine needles into the skin and underlyingtissues at specific points, for therapeutic or preventativepurposes. Evidence of the neurophysiological mechanismsunderlying acupuncture now exists [ 190-193]. For example, the release of a number of endogenous substances including-endorphin,met-enkephalin,anddynorphinswasobserved during treatment [ 194-196]. Moreover, acupuncture can alter gene expression, upregulating opioid production [ 197, 198]. Acupuncture works by modulating noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways to give extra segmental pain relief,that is, analgesia throughout the body [ 199]. releases serotonin [ 200], oxytocin [ 201], and endogenous steroids [ 202], which may further contribute to analgesia. In functional MRI studies, acupuncture induced brain acti- vation in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens and deactivated areas of the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala,andhippocampus.Intermsofanalgesia,itwassuggestedthatacupuncturemodulatedtheaffective-cognitiveaspectofpainperception [ 199]. Furthermore, correlations between signal intensities and analgesic effects have been reported [ 203]. Further work using PET scanning showed that acupunctureinducedextraeffectsintheipsilateralinsulabeyondtheshamneedle, which also had greater effects on activation patternsthanthecontrolgroup[ 107]. Recent advances in clinical research on acupuncture suggest that acupuncture provides clinical benefit for breastoncology patients in symptom control and supportive care.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7 Symptoms that respond to acupuncture treatment include pain,gastrointestinalsideeffects,hotflushes,fatigue,anxiety,depression, and insomnia.

Daily flush frequency was the main outcome measure. All the studies used self-administrated questionnaires to measure this effect. Sometrials also used the Kupperman Index (KI) to score climac-teric symptoms. Most studies used six or more acupointsof which SP6 was the most commonly used.

Nausea and Vomiting. Ten studies included in Table 2 investigated the antiemetic effect of acupuncture on distresssymptoms induced by chemotherapy [ 119-126]. Participants received intervention over a treatment period of 5 days to3 weeks. These studies, including three high quality studies[118,119,121], reported that acupuncture could significantly improve emesis caused by breast cancer therapy. Acupunc-ture stimulation at points PC6 and ST36 has repeatedlybeen shown to be a clinically useful antiemetic treatment for postoperative nausea and vomiting and chemotherapy- induced emesis. In 1998, the US NIH stated that \"acupunc-ture is a proven effective treatment modality for or minimal acupuncture demonstrated thatthe electroacupuncture plus antiemetics arm was the mosteffectiveforpreventingnauseaandvomitingassociatedwithhigh-dosechemotherapy[ 121].Ezzoandcolleaguesreviewed eleven trials in 2006 and concluded that electroacupuncturehas demonstrated benefit for chemotherapy-induced acutevomiting,andself-administeredacupressureappearstohavea protective effect against acute nausea and can readily betaught to patients [ 206]. Since then, two multicenter longi- tudinalRCTshaveshownthebeneficialeffectofacupressurein significantly reducing the severity of both acute anddelayed vomiting [ 118,119]. These studies also demonstrate that acupuncture and acupressure are simple to administerandmeritwiderconsideration. 3.3.3. Pain. Up to 70% of cancer patients still suffer signif- icant pain which adversely impacts their QOL [ 207]. Bone painisthemostcommontypeofcancer-associatedpain,andbone metastases are common in advanced breast cancers.Current pain-relieving strategies the use of opioid-based analgesics, bisphosphonates, and radiotherapy. Thepharmacological failure to control pain alone has led tothe use of nondrug treatments including acupuncture. Theanalgesiceffectsofacupuncturemaypermitadecreaseintherequirement and side effects of pharmaceuticals. It can alsohelpthosewhoaresensitivetonormaldosesofanalgesicsandthose who have pain despite analgesic dose titration [ 196]. Although acupuncture is used in palliative care settings forall types of cancer pain, the evidence base is still insufficientand inconclusive and there is very little evidence to show itseffectivenessinrelievingcancer-inducedpain[ 208,209]. Threetrialsusedacupuncturetomanagepostmastectomy pain(Table 2)[127-129,208,209].AcupointL14wasusedin all the three trials. demonstrated a significanteffectfavoringtheacupuncturegroup[ 128,129],butonehigh quality RCT [ 127] found no significant difference between the intervention group and the control group. Althoughreviews vary in their conclusions,acupuncturewas foundtobe superior to no treatment or waiting list control in moststudies. Finally, emerging evidence demonstrates the analgesic effectiveness of both acupuncture and electroacupuncturein breast cancer patients experiencing joint pain as a resultof adjuvant aromatase inhibitor treatment. Four trials haveincludedinvestigationofarthralgia,andallexploredtheeffectof acupuncture therapy on aromatase inhibitor-related jointpain and functional ability ( Table 2). Positive results were obtained including enhanced postoperative analgesic effi-ciency, relief of postoperative pain, and significant improve-mentinjointandmusclestiffness[ 128,130-132,210]. 3.3.4. Fatigue. Fatigueisanextremelycommonsymptomin cancer patients [ 211]. Fatigue is also an adverse side effect of chemotherapyandradiotherapy,whichcanpersistlongafterthe cessation of treatment. In a prospective phase II study on patients with persistent fatigue who had previously com- pleted chemotherapy, acupuncture resulted in a significantreductioninbaselinefatiguescores[ 212].FurtherfourRCTs showed that acupuncture was associated with a significantimprovementingeneralfatiguescores[ 213-216]. 3.3.5. Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia. The two anxiety, sickness, and dyspnoea (ASAD) points located at the upperleft and right sternal regions are used extensively in the UKto control dyspnea and also anxiety. Patients can to control these distressing symptoms in the event of a panic attack. In a systematic review of RCTs ofacupuncture in the treatment of depression, Leo and Ligot Jr. stated that although the odd ratios derived from com- paring acupuncture with control conditions in the existing literaturesuggestaroleforacupuncture,theevidenceisthus far inconclusive [ 217]. More recent evidence suggests that acupuncturewhencombinedwithantidepressanttherapyhasa faster therapeutic onset rate than pharmacotherapy alone, c o u p l e dw i t har e d u c t i o ni nt h es i d ee ff e c tp r o fi l eo ft h e antidepressant medication [ 218]. An additional RCT exam- ining the treatmentof hot flushes revealed that compared to women taking venlafaxine, those receiving acupuncture felt theyhadmoreenergy,improvedclarityofthought,increasedlibido, and a greater sense of well-being [ 219]. In one study donebyMehlingandcolleagues,massageandacupuncturein postoperative cancer patients who were also receiving usual careresultedinasignificantimprovementintheirdepressed mood with short-lived significant improvement in tensionand anxiety when compared to patients receiving usual care alone [220]. A subsequent meta-analysis revealed that the rate of improvement in insomnia produced by auricular acupuncture was significantly higher than that achieved by taking Diazepam [ 221]. Although a Cochrane systematic review of acupuncture for insomnia in 2007 concludedthat acupuncture or its variants were not more effective than the control groups [ 222], five clinical studies showed significantimprovementinanxietyanddepressionovertime in patients who underwent acupuncture treatment. QOL measures of pain severity and interference, physical andpsychological distress, life satisfaction, and mood states alsoshowed improved scores after acupuncture treatment [ 223- 227]. 3.3.6. Lymphoedema and Leukopenia. Lymphoedema is a distressing problem that affects many women after breastcancersurgery.IntheUnitedStates,needlingandevenliftingobjects using the affected arm has been prohibited, resultingin a limited number of publications on acupuncture andlymphoedema [ 133]. However, recent results of two studies demonstratedthattraditionalacupunctureafterbreastcancersurgery was associated with improvements body of evidence comes from China whereasystematicreviewofRCTswaspositiveforincreasing WBC in patients undergoing chemotherapy [ 228]; however, the quality of trials was considered poor, and the authorssuggest that the positivemeta-analysisshouldbe consideredasexploratory. 3.4. Safety of Acupuncture. With an increasing number of positive evidence-based acupuncture trials, more cancerpatients may seek acupuncture treatment. While closelymonitored clinical trials often report low incidences ofadverseeventsofacupuncture,manyphysiciansremaincon-cernedaboutitssafety.Seriousadverseeventsareexceedinglyrare\u2014roughly five in one million [ 229]\u2014and are usually associated with poorly trained, unlicensed acupuncturists[230]. The vast majority of adverse events from acupunctureEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 9 are minor; those most commonly reported occur at the site of needle insertion: minor bleeding (3%), hematoma(2-3%), and pain from needling (up to 3%). Dizziness isr e p o r t e di na b o u t1 %o ft r e a t m e n t s[ 229,231,232]. Serious adverse effects including pneumothorax, spinal lesions, andhepatitis Btransmission have been reported in the litera- ture for acupuncture, but these are rare and are generally associated with poorly trained unlicensed acupuncturists[233]. Acupuncture for oncology should be administered by asuitablyqualifiedpractitionerwhocanmaintainaconstantdialogue with the oncology team treating the patient. Thecontraindicationsandcautionsforacupunctureinanoncol-ogysettingareoutlinedin Table 3. Ingeneral,acupuncturecanbeconsideredasafemethod of treatment, with a low side effect profile, which in partaddstoitspopularityamongpatients[ 234-236].Establishing an eligibility guideline for cancer patients before receivingacupuncture would add another layer of safety. Lu andRosenthal suggested that cancer patients should not be rec-ommendedforacupunctureiftheyhaveoneofthefollowingconditions: (a) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than500/L, (b) platelet count less than 25,000/ L, (c) altered mental state, (d) clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias,and (e) other unstable medical conditions (case-by-caseconsideration). Guidelines for safe practice within this fieldhave previously been published [ 237]. Before the first visit, approvalisrequiredfromtheprimaryoncologistbasedupontheseguidelines[ 238]. 4. Conclusions and Future Prospects Research on CAM as adjuvants in chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, particularly that on herbal medicine andacupuncture,hasgainedmomentumoverthepastfewyears.Thisdevelopmentpavesthewaytowardunderstandingtheirefficacy and modes of action in alleviating cancer or cancertreatment-relatedconditions.Evidencefromvarious invitro, in vivostudies andRCTs supporttheuseof herbalmedicine immune system, in relievingpain,fatigue,cyto-andhepatotoxicity,andininhibitinggas-trointestinaltoxicity,angiogenesis,andothersideeffectsfromchemo- and radiotherapy. The inclusion of selected herbalmedicines from well-designed RCTs in this review providesevidence-based knowledge to strengthen the rationale forthe use of herbal medicines in controlling breast cancer in the clinical setting. Further, considering the assessment of benefit:risk ratio of the presented results, acupuncture isseen as a valuable nonpharmaceutical treatment option forsymptom management in cancer patients. Although currentevidence from basic science and clinical research on herbalmedicines or acupuncture is still not sufficient to changeoncological practice in general, the quality and design ofclinical trials have significantly improved over the last fewyears which can provide patients with the most effectiveprotocols or treatment types and safety profiles. Despite allthe evidence presented, key challenges still exist includingquality control of herbal medicinal materials, standardiza-tion of practices and drug components or between chemotherapy and herbal medicine. Furtherresearchaddressingthesechallengesintheformofrigorouslydesigned clinical trials accompanied by comprehensive andin-depth laboratory studies is needed to improve the qualityoftheexistingevidencebaseandsupporttheuseofCAM.
