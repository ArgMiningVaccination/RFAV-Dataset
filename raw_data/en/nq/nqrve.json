On the island there are accommodations for all needs and tastes. Hostels and guesthouses are great places to meet people - most of them have breakfast included and dreamy swimming pools. However, what would really give a local taste to someone's experience in Bali is to live in a homestay, run by Balinese families. It gives the chance to live in a traditional compound and be welcomed in the daily local life. Most likely, guests are invited to traditional ceremonies in the temple of the local village: the best way to dive deep into the timeless Balinese culture and spirituality. It will definitely set the tone of a solo travel experience. Alternatively, if thinking of a pampering and full relaxing holiday, Bali hosts some of the most luxurious hotels in the world, perched in between the lush tropical jungle or overlooking jaw-dropping beaches, like the [REVIVO Wellness Resort](#REVIVO). Surrounded by dense Rainforest in Nusa Dua, this resort offers three types of Balinese style suites and two Four-Suite Villas, a pool and a vast area to stroll around and soak up Bali nature. Another option, quite easy to find, is to rent a room in a shared villa: perfect for feeling at home on the Island of the Gods and have the chance to meet fellow solo travellers, but in a more quiet environment than a hostel. And if you prefer a mix of all [Vision Villa Resort ](#Vision Villa Resort)in East Bali coould be the right choice. Filled with elemental themes and Zen-inspired adornments, as well as a healthy beach club, it's perfect for both meeting fellow travelers, and feeling as one with nature. Bali is one of the main destinations in the world for digital nomads and location independent professionals. There are plenty of coworking spaces on the island and also of coliving spaces, where fellow nomads gather and work together for either a short or long-term period. One of them is [Outpost](#outpost), which has been voted as the best coworking space on Bali for two years in a row by Coworker.com. Outpost offers training on personal development, happy hours with live music and opportunities to enhance your business through skill shares and networking sessions. They have three locations across Bali including a beachside space in Canggu and two in Ubud. How to move around? Most accommodations have a paid airport shuttle service. It's highly recommended to get the WhatsApp number of the driver before departing to be able to communicate when being at the airport - there's free wifi. Since there are usually many drivers waiting at the arrival gate it is always good to have a contact. After that, it's convenient to rent a scooter to get around since the roads can get busy and it's easier to move around by motorbike than by car. Cycling is also an option, but only for short routes outside the busiest spots: Bali has steep hills and the weather is hot...a scooter is a much more comfortable choice and always brings that sense of freedom when feeling the wind touching the face. If someone is not feeling confident to drive, there are some alternatives. The most popular driver service app on the island is called \"GoJek.\" It's possible to choose between scooter and car. Quick and easy. Also, there are many taxi drivers waiting along the streets. Moving around won't be an issue for sure and sharing a car could be such a good way to meet new friends during your solo travel. Tip: almost every restaurant, venue and accommodation has very good wifi. However, Google Maps can be convenient to get around, so it is better to get a local sim card, for example \"Telekomsel\". The cost is about 100k IDR per new card and the owners of the accommodations usually know where the next local shop is that sells them. What to do when solo travelling in Bali? It depends if someone prefers to stay alone or if someone is keen to meet new friends. No worries though, there's a vast choice for both moods. What to do when wanting to stay alone during a solo travel Well, the best option is to just grab a scooter and go for a ride in the lush countryside or discover wild beaches. The Northern part of the Island is perfect for that. It's the ideal place to go chasing waterfalls, snorkeling and scuba diving. While for relaxing and embracing that solo inner journey, why not signing up for a silent retreat in the Balinese hills? If you prefer a more vivid surrounding, the town of Ubud is the perfect for solo travellers willing to experience that 'urban' vibe. Just grab a book and sit in a comfy cafe, like [KAFE](#KAFE) in Hanoman Road. Or why not joining a movie night? [The Yoga Barn](#The Yoga Barn) has those every Monday and the Betelnut noodle, satay bar and music lounge offers a vast choice of films and documentaries. An institution when it comes to watching movies is the [Paradiso Ubud](#PARADISO UBUD), the world's first vegan cinema.It is a cultural center that combines a movie theater, live performance space, raw vegan bar and cafe, shop and a private event facility. Another great experience is the visit of a healer. There are quite a few healers around the island, who not only check the state of health by ancient healing methods, but also not rarely give some guidance for your life. In addition to that, Bali is the perfect place for wellness and spa treatments. Whether as traditional Balinese Massage, herbal baths or other wellness treatments, the island has it all. You can choose between Spa's only, Health centers or hotels, which have inhouse Spa and Wellness areas. An example is the [REMISSIO](#REMISSIO) spa at REVIVO Hotel Nusa Dua, which brings together ancient Balinese healing traditions, aroma, hydro and chromo therapies together with complex wellness facilities. What to do when wanting to meet new friends while solo travelling Yoga classes are a great place to bump into fellow travellers and Ubud is the spot to be. Yoga centres like [The Yoga Barn](#The Yoga Barn) give a well-rounded experience, with more 100 classes per week, 7 studios, monthly workshops, ecstatic dances, acro yoga jams, talks and other event. Basically, it's a community where it's very easy to meet like-minded people. For people that love the beach the most, the village of Canggu has everything to offer. Why not joining a surf camp and meet new adventurous peeps while riding waves? There are surf camps all around Canggu, Seminyak, Kuta, the Bukit Peninsula and other parts of the island. Perfect for solo female travelers, are the [Goddess Retreats](#Goddess Retreats), offering an enchanting space where the best of yoga, health and wellness retreats come together in a light-hearted and friendly environment packed with fun, laughter and plenty of time to unwind from the pressures of life. Also [Pelan Pelan Surfcamp](#Pelan) is a nice option for doing that.It offers a mixture of surf, yoga, amazing Indonesian food, and spa Treatments, just outside the crowd of Canggu Also, Bali is the mecca for digital nomads around the world. There are many coworking spaces on the island, with amazing and lively communities and lots and lots of events. Perfect for networking while on holiday, and why not, maybe discussing about a next entrepreneurial projects and get inspired by new ideas. A work-ation at its best. Besides the already mentioned [Outpost](#outpost), Hubud coworking and community space - the first coworking space in Bali - for example organises more than 400 events a year and it's all about changing the way people live and work, while also having fun with the other fellow members. Last, but definitely not least, let's not forget about festivals, \"the\" spot to gather and meet new people when solo travelling. Bali has a lot of music festivals down the southern coast, like Sunny Side Up Tropical Fest at Potato Head in Seminyak. While Ubud is home of the Bali Vegan Food Festival and the Ubud Food Festival, unmissable for the foodies out there. Also, Bali hosts the largest yoga festival in Asia, [BaliSpirit Festival](http://www.balispiritfestival.com), where art, music, yoga, dance and healing beautiful intertwine to create an unforgettable experience and perfect event to join a like-minded community of conscious solo travellers and people from all over the world. What else to keep in mind? Have a travel health insurance! When traveling to Bali it is essential to have a health insurance. For most of the travelers, tropical temperatures and surroundings are not quite what they are used to and even though we hope for the best, it still can happen that you become ill. There is good access to medical services in Bali, be it doctors or hospitals - but they can get pricy. Having health insurance can save you a lot of money - and we really mean a lot - and hassle, especially when traveling alone. One provider we can recommend is [World Nomads](https://www.worldnomads.com/?affiliate=bs89310&subId=email&affiliateTrackingId=ee5c4ee186644471a4157d82bf977fc9&utm_source=bs89310&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Affiliate&utm_content=email), but there are also many others. See a list of travel health insurance providers [here.](https://www.consumersadvocate.org/travel-insurance) To embrace solo travel might seem scary before departure. \"Am I going to be ok?\" \"Will I feel lonely?\" \"Will it be easy to meet people?\" \"Will I get lost?\" All questions popping in solo travellers head when planning a trip. Bali is an amazing destination for solo travellers and solo travel itself is a unique life-changing experience that everyone should have at least once in their life. Solo travel allows people to meet new friends, to engage with locals on a more personal level and to dive deeper in and understanding more the local culture. Also, solo travellers are free to move and adventure as they like: isn't it liberating to travel somewhere where no-one knows who we are? There's a rare sense of freedom that nourishes every cell of the body and mind. Plus, alone time is definitely healthy and being alone makes people appreciate the people that count the most in our life. Let's embrace the freedom of it, a bit of fear is ok, but the exciting one!
