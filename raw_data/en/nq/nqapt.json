On December 11, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the first emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, paving the way for the first vaccinations against the disease. One week later, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Even with two separate vaccines available, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) predicted that supplies would be initially limited, and recommended that the first doses of the vaccine be allocated to healthcare personnel and long-term care facility residents. Northwestern Medicine physicians have begun receiving their vaccines, an experience that for many was inspiring, sobering and hopeful.
