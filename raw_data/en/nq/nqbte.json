The short-term goals for this one-year supplement are to: - Understand characteristics of vaccine-hesitant communities within the cancer center catchment area - Identify promising and innovative approaches to reducing hesitancy and other barriers to HPV vaccination - Gather pilot data to support future interventions towards reducing vaccine hesitancy and increasing HPV vaccination. This supplement is part of a larger effort to bring together NCI cancer centers, CDC programs, and state/local health departments and their immunization programs. These administrative supplements are being offered in response to the Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel Report's recommendation \"to expand the use of proven prevention and early detection strategies\" and the World Health Organization's report which cited vaccine hesitancy as one the \"Ten Threats to Global Health in 2019.\" Two previous rounds of supplements were issued to NCI-designated cancer centers that focused on increasing HPV vaccination rates in regions with low HPV vaccination uptake. NCI funded supplements 18 supplements in 2014 and 12 supplements in 2017.
