That's why our essential oil candles and wax melts use all-natural ingredients and are [MADE SAFE\u00ae certified](https://fontanacandlecompany.com/pages/made-safe%C2%AE-certified)! Fontana candles are free of fragrance oils and other harmful ingredients, like paraffin. Instead, we use [pure essential oils](https://fontanacandlecompany.com/collections/essential-oils) to create a range of non-toxic candle scents - from light citrus to rich floral aromas. Whether you have sensitivities to traditional candles or simply want a safer alternative, Fontana's all-natural wax melts make a perfect addition to your home or office. They also [make an excellent gift](https://fontanacandlecompany.com/collections/scent-samplers)! What Is A Wax Melt? Wax melts are small pucks of wax and essential oils without the wicks. They are meant to be used in a wax warmer for a flameless candle option. When the light bulb in the warmer melts the wax pucks, it releases the scent into the air similar to how a traditional candle works as the flame melts the wax. The wax pucks have the cutest bee motif and are sold in a completely biodegradable custom gift box. Each box of wax melt pucks has an approximate burn time of 20 to 25 hours, which is the equivalent of our 6 ounce small tin candles. Fontana Uses Safe Candle Ingredients Our wax melt products contain zero harmful chemicals. [Each candle ingredient](https://fontanacandlecompany.com/pages/ingredients) is simple and non-toxic: - Beeswax - Coconut oil - Pure essential oils No toxic paraffin or petroleum byproducts. No artificial fragrance oils. We hand-selected safe ingredients to create our truly non-toxic, beeswax, and essential oil based candles. None of our ingredients or products are ever tested on animals, and we are certified cruelty-free by the Leaping Bunny Program. Transparency And Trust Many candlemakers claim their products are natural, but they still don't disclose their ingredients or hide behind \"proprietary blends.\" At Fontana, we believe in transparency. We chose to submit our products through third-party testing. MADE SAFE\u00ae is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that independently certifies non-toxic products. Fontana is the first candlemaker to earn a MADE SAFE\u00ae non-toxic certification.

We take as many precautions as possible to ensure your order arrives in tip-top shape in the warmest of weather. Please note the ice packs only protect the candles for approximately 24-48 hours. If you are experiencing extremely hot weather where you live, we recommend waiting to cooler weather to order Wax Melts. "}
