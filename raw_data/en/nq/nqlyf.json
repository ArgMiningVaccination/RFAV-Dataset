So, why is that? We know and understand that everyone with an addiction to drugs or alcohol is an individual with complex needs. We consider a person's overall health by combining medical doctors who use conventional medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, and alternative therapies. This holistic combination treats symptoms that affect a wide range of biological, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of a person's life. Addiction Treatment Centers and Holistic Treatment Models If you are dealing with a substance use disorder, you are much more than your addiction. Your life experiences also shape who you are and can contribute to the development of addictions. Drugs and alcohol affect the brain and body in so many ways. Substances affect your physical health, your brain changes, and you may find yourself dealing with consequences in every part of your life. You could have legal troubles, relationship problems, or your career may be suffering. With holistic treatment, your chances of a successful recovery go up. Holistic treatment looks at every part of who you are and what brought you to the point you are in your life currently. We see you as much more than an addiction, and your treatment is individualized with you in mind and central to everything. The Mind-Body Connection One part of understanding how holistic treatment works is to think about [ the mind-body connection.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/mind-body-medicine-in-addiction-recovery-2020102821239) The mind-body connection is a philosophy saying, the outcomes of a physical illness stem from the interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors. - Our emotional health is affected by stress from significant events in our lives and also by our daily routines. - The mind-body connection in addiction treatment isn't necessarily new. Mind-body principles are part of Alcoholics Anonymous and 12-step programs and have been since the 1930s. - When you are dealing with addiction, it hijacks your brain's reward system. The result is that you choose drugs or alcohol over even your survival needs. - With mind-body therapies in addiction treatment, therapists address the neurological disorder directly. We look at the biological reasons for substance abuse. Holistic treatment emphasizing the mind-body connection improves your mental and physical health and your brain function simultaneously. What is Holistic Treatment? A holistic addiction treatment program is one focusing on your mind and your body for complete healing. With a holistic approach, your physical and psychological needs and spiritual needs are part of your treatment plan. With a holistic approach, you may be more comfortable entering treatment. You may also find that it dramatically increases your chances of a successful, long-term recovery. There isn't one specific type of holistic treatment. Instead, the individual is central to everything. Your treatment plan isn't like anyone else's because your experiences are unique, as is your addiction. A combination of approaches will support you in being the best version of yourself on your recovery journey. Types of holistic treatments include: 1. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) EMDR is an evidence-based therapy to help with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and trauma. With EMDR, you can help strengthen your brain's natural ability to heal itself from traumatic or difficult experiences. A gentle approach, EMDR can help specifically heal the areas of your brain that trauma affects. You learn to feel safe when you think about a traumatic memory.

Nutritional Counseling As part of a well-rounded treatment plan, you may receive [nutritional counseling](https://opustreatment.com/substance-abuse/getting-over-addiction-with-nutrition/).

For your mind to heal, your body needs to heal. You may work with nutrition experts to give your body the fuel it needs and overcome nutritional deficiencies. Having a nutritional plan also helps you begin rebuilding your life through healthy habits and a sense of structure. 5. Neurofeedback With neurofeedback, a computer reads your brainwaves through something known as EEG. This is helpful for addiction as well as trauma and other symptoms of mental health disorders. You get a visual of the activity in your brain. Then, you can see how your brain's activity changes as you use relaxation and mindfulness techniques. Neurofeedback can be complementary to cognitive behavioral therapy. 6. Exercise & Massage Therapy Physical exercise can help with anxiety and depression symptoms. Having a physical outlet can help restore your brain's chemical levels to a sense of balance. You may also find that participating in regular exercise enables you to avoid relapse because it gives you another outlet. 7. Acupuncture When you detox from drugs and alcohol and addiction treatment, acupuncture can help bring about balance to your physical and mental health. Acupuncture can help with specific symptoms of withdrawal, such as nausea and headaches. This holistic treatment also improves mood and positive feelings, and it's a safe procedure. 8.
