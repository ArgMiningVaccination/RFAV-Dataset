The foregoing amend- ments shall become effective upon issuance. The amendments quarantine a portion of Lafayette County, Miss., and portions of Nansemond and Isle of Wight Coun- ties in Virginia because of the existence of hog cholera. This action is deemed necessary to prevent further spread of the disease. The restrictions pertaining to the interstate movement of swine and swine products from or through quar- antined areas as contained in 9 CFR Part 76, as amended, will apply to the quaran- tined areas designated herein.The amendments impose certain fur- ther restrictions necessary to prevent the interstate spread of hog cholera and must be made effective immediately to accomplish their purpose in the public interest. Accordingly, under the admin- istrative procedure provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found upon good cause that notice and other public procedure with respect to the amendments are imprac- ticable and contrary to the public inter- est and good cause is found for making them effective less than 30 days after publication in the FEDERAL REGISTER.

It appearing, that an acute shortage of certain plain boxcars exists on the railroads named in paragraph (a) (1) herein; that shippers located on the lines of these carriers are being deprived of such cars required for loading, resulting in a severe emergency and causing grain elevators to be unable to accept newly harvested grain, or to store grain on the ground, thus creating economic loss; that present rules, regulations, and prac- tices with respect to the use, supply, con- trol, movement, distribution, exchange, interchange, and return of boxcars owned by these railroads are ineffective. It is the opinion of the Commission that an emergency exists requiring immediate action to promote car service in the in- terest of the public and the commerce of the people. Accordingly, the Commis- sion finds that notice and public proce- dure are impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and that good cause exists for making this order effective upon less than 30 days' notice. It is ordered, That: \u00a7 1033.1041 Service Order No. 1041. (a) Distribution of boxcars.

Section 7 of the Fishermen's Protec- tive Act of 1967 (Public Law 90-482; 22 U.S.C. 1977), authorized the Secretary of the Interior to set fees to be chargedfor the furnishing of a guarantee agree- ment. The Fishermen's Protective Act Procedures, which became effective Feb- ruary 9, 1969, established fees, based on anticipated losses, to provide for pay- ment of the administrative costs and one-third of the .estimated claims to be paid from the Fishermen's protective fund. Experience to date in the payment of claims under this program indicates that a change in the fee schedule on a fiscal-year basis is not warranted at this time. However, to avoid the necessity for issuing two guarantee agreements within a period of 4 months with the consequent additional costs to the owners an op- tional fee is authorized for any guarantee agreements effected between March 1, 1970, and June 30, 1970, in the event the owner desires to have the guarantee agreement extend through June 30, 1971. This amendment relates to matters which are exempt from the rule making requirements of the Administrative Pro- cedures Act (5 U.S.C. 1003). Furthermore this amendment has the effect of relax- ing previous restrictions and so should be made effective immediately. This amendment is hereby adopted and will become effective on the date of its pub- lication in the FEDERAL REGISTER. Section 258.5 is hereby amended as follows: \u00a7 258.5 Fees. (a) The fees during' the period ending on June 30, 1970, are established to pro- vide for payment of the administrative costs and one-third of the estimated claims to be paid from the fund. They will be set based on anticipated lossesand prior experience. The fee schedule may be increased or decreased by amendment to this part at any time, if warranted by changed conditions; and if this change takes place prior to the end of a fiscal year it will be applicable to all contracts executed after the effec- tive date of the amendment. (b) The fees to be paid by an appli- cant during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971, shall be as follows: For each vessel $60 plus $1.80 per gross ton as listed on the vessel's documents. Frac- tions of a ton are not included. (c) The fees-vill cover the guarantee agreement for a fiscal year ending on June 30, or any part of that fiscal year. No return of a fee or portion of a fee will be made after an agreement is executed by the Secretary. (d) The fees to be paid by an appli- cant to cover a guarantee agreement executed between March 1 and June 30, 1970, in the event said applicant desires to have the guarantee agreement extend through June 30, 1971, shall be as fol- lows: For each vessel $90 plus $2.70 per gross ton as listed on the vessel's docu- ments. Fractions of a ton are not included. (e) A guarantee agreement may, with the consent of the Secretary, be assigned to a new owner of a vessel if the owner- ship of the vessel is transferred during the period in which the agreement is in force.

Notices of investigation, proposed rule- making, and statement on new applica- tions for certificates for sale of Permian Basin area natural gas. 1. Notice is hereby given, that pursu- ant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. (1967) and sections 4, 5, 7, 8, 14, 15, and 16 of the 1tatural Gas Act (52 Stat. 822, 823, 824, 825, 828, 829, 830; 56 Stat. 83, to be'conducted in this docket, the Commission proposes to issue rules fixing the terms and conditions under which it will issue permanent certif- icates for, and will otherwise regulate. new sales of natural gas subject to the Commission's jurisdiction in the Per- mian Basin area, under contracts dated after the date of issuance of a rule herein. The rates to be set pursuant to this rulemaking will be firm rates, not subject to refund obligation. However, any rate set will be subject to prospec- tive modification at the conclusion of the new Permian Basin area rate proceeding which we have today instituted by sepa- rate order in Docket No. AR70-1, 35 P.R. 10180. Data available to the Commission in- dicates that interstate pipelines are un- able to procure contracts for new sup- plies of gas, on a spot or long-term basis, at the same relative rate as heretofore, and that this does not appear to repre- sent any decline in the productivity of the area below earlier estimates. Re- cently significant pipeline capacity for intrastate transportation aid sales has been put into operation. 2. We do not propose any specific terms and conditions in this notice. Rather, we will rely in making that determination on the responses to be filed herein. We propose to amend \u00a7 2.56 Area price levels for natural gas sales by independ- ent producers, as amended, in Part 2- General Policy and Interpretations, Chapter I, Title 18 of the Code of Fed- eral Regulations. 3. As an aid to interested parties (hereinafter \"parties\") in preparing responses, and as notice to those who may be examined in this investigation, we set forth specific areas of inquiry, the purpose of which is to determine the terms and conditions which will result in an adequate supply of natural gas for consumers at the lowest rate consistent with maintaining an industry structure capable of providing, ,and motivated toprovide, service with its attendant risks. See Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747 (1968) (hereinafter \"Permian\"); Austral Oil Co. v. F.P.C., -F. 2d - (Fifth Circuit 1970, slip opinion dated Mlar. 19, 1970, No. 27492, et al.) (here- inafter \"Austral\"). 4. First, we call on all parties includ- ing staff to submit an estimate of the current, nationwide cost of finding and producing nonassociated natural gas. This-estimate should be made using as far as possible the costing methods set forth in Commission Opinions Nos. 468 (34 FPC 191-207) and 546 (40 FPC 556- 589). An explanation of the methods used in estimating current cost, together with all supporting calculations, shall be at- tached to the response. New gas cost es- timates should be determined at the in- dicated 12 percent rate of return for pur- poses of responding to this paragraph 4. However, in their responses to the para- graph 5, the parties will have an oppor- tunity to state any alternative rates of return which they deem more appropri- ate. The Bureau of Natural Gas has made a preliminary estimate which indicates cost increases in the range of 3-5 cents per Mcf exclusive of any modification in rate of return. 5. Second, We call on all parties to respond on rate of return and other fac- tors discussed by the Supreme Court in Permian, supra, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Austral, supra. 6. Third, we call on parties to respond on the question of the weight to be given to gas contract prices, terms, and in- ducements or commodity value, in con- sidering producer rates and on the ques- tion of whether the market mechanism in the light of pipeline regulation will adequately protect consumer interests. See Permian, supra, p. 795. Any party responding to this issue should either include any information he may have concerning prices and other relevant terms applicable to contracts dated on or after January 1, 1966, for the intrastate sale of natural gas in the Permian Basin and any information he may have con- cerning prices and other relevant terms offered (or demanded), but not accepted, for contracts for interstate sale of natu- ral gas in the Permian Basin (together with the factors \"believed to be the cause of the failure to contract) or state that no such information is available to him or state the reason or reasons why the information is withheld. Nothing herein shall limit investigation by the staff (pursuant to paragraph 11, infra), independent of any responses which may be filed. 7. A public hearing will be held in this proceeding commencing on July 29, 1970, for the purpose of allowing a number of persons such as small producers to state their views in lieu of filing written com- ments. This hearing will be held in Mid-land High School Auditorium, Midland, Tex., commencing at 10 am. and thence from day to day until recessed by an officer designated by paragraph 11, infra. Any statements taken at a public hear- ing announced hy the Commission or Its Secretary will be reduced to written form and will be considered together with the filed comments in this docket. Any party who wishes to make an oral statement in lieu of filing written comments should file a request with the Secretary on or before July 10, 1970. The request shall state the name, title, and mailing ad- dress of the person, the interest he has or represents in this proceeding, and a waiver of the right to fie written com- ments pursuant to paragraph 10, infra. Denial of an oral presentation means only that the person should file written comments if he wishes to be heard. Per- sons whose request is granted will be notified by mail of the date and time al- lotted. Additional hearings may be held upon notice from the Secretary. 8. This rulemaking proceeding shall encompass Texas Railroad Commission Districts 7-B, 7-C, 8, and 8-A; Val Verde, Edwards, Real, Bandera, Kendall, Comal, Gillespie, Mason, Llano, Blanco, Hays, Travis, Burnet, Williamson, Milam, and Bell Counties located in Texas Rail- road Commission District 1; and Chaves, Eddy, Lea, and Roosevelt Counties, N.

The Bureau of Land Management ad- vertises for public auction between 450- 500 timber sales each year. Prospective purchasers receive detailed sale bro- chures on each tract of timber to be offered. Bids are determined from on- the-ground inspections, information contained in sale brochures and presale reviews of the proposed timber sale con- tracts. The need no longer exists forlengthy newspaper legal notices contain- ing bidding procedures, timber recovery tabulations and appraisal data, since such information is now mailed to eachprospective bidder in advance of the sale. This amendment will reduce the num- ber of mandatory items to be included in a legal newspaper notice. It is the policy of the Department of the Interior, wheneyer practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to par- ticipate in the rule making process. Ac- cordingly, interested parties may submit written comments, suggestions, or objec- tions with respect to the proposed rules to the Director (210), Bureau of Land Management, Washington, D.C. 20240, within 30 days of the publication of this notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER.

(c) (1) Except as provided in sub- paragraph (2) of this paragraph, a person shall be eligible for an alloca- tion of imports into District I of No. 2 20, 197010153 PROPOSED RULE MAKING fuel oil under paragraph (e). of this section: (i) If he is in the business in District I of selling No. 2 fuel oil and has under his management and operational con- trol a deep water terminal located in District I into which there has been delivered No. 2 fuel oil which he owned at the time of delivery, such delivery being the first delivery of that oil into a deep water terminal in District I; or (ii) if he is in the business in Dis- trict I of selling No. 2 fuel oil and has a throughput agreement (warehouse agreement) with a deep water termi- nal operator in District I who does not have a crude oil import allocation in Districts I-IV under which agreement the person has delivered to the termi- nal No. 2 fuel oil which he owned when it was so delivered, such delivery being the first delivery of that oil into a deep water terminal in District I. For the purposes of this section, \"throughout agreement\" means an agreement which provides for the de- livery to a deep water terminal by a person of No. 2 fuel oil which he owns and for a right in such person to with- draw on call an identical quantity of such oil from the terminal. A qualify- ing throughput agreement will be deemed to exist only (1) if the person operating under the agreement owned-the oil at the time it was delivered to the terminal and only if that delivery was the first delivery of that oil into a deep water terminal in District I; and (2) if the person has delivered at least 100,000 barrels of No. 2 fuel oil into-the terminal under the agreement during the 12-month period ending March 31, 1970. Any transaction between persons involving sales, purchases, or exchanges of No. 2 fuel oil which were designed to gain allocation benefits to otherwise ineligible persons shall not be deemed a qualifying throughput agreement. (2) No person who has an allocation of imports into Districts I-IV of crude oil under section 9, 10, or 25 of this regulation shall be eligible for an allo- cation under paragraph (e) of this section. (d) A person seeking an allocation under paragraph (e) of this section must file an application with the Administra- tor no later than 10 days after the pro- mulgation of the regulation. The appli- cation shall disclose in detail such information as the Administrator may require. (e) C1) Except as provided in subpara- graph (2) of the paragraph, each appli- cant eligible under this section shall re- ceive an allocation of imports of No. 2 fuel oil into District I computed accord- ing to the following formula: Applicant's qualified B/D 40,000 Avg B/D of No. Avg B/D of all qualified terminal inputs (Apr. 1, 1969-Mar. 31,1970) X 2 fuel oil (2) If an applicant- eligible under this section has an allocation under section 13 of this regulation of imports into Districts I-IV of finished products, the allocation computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be reduced by, the amount of the allocation of imports of finished products. The Administrator shall allocate the quantity of imports re- sulting from reductions under this sub- paragraph (2) according to the following formula: Total reductions Applicant's Total of Actual Allocations Allocation (f) (1) Only those inputs of No. 2 fuel oil which were made as provided in this paragraph (f) are qualified terminal in- puts for the purposes of allocations under paragraph (e) of this section. The termi- nal input is designed to measure an eli- gible person's bona fide business done through deep water terminal facilities. Any inputs resulting from sales, pur- chases, or exchanges which were made for the purpose of increasing the terminal input base disproportionately to bona fide business sales shall not constitute quali- fied terminal inputs. (2) In order to constitute a qualified terminal input, a delivery of No. 2 fuel oil into a deep water terminal must have been made during the period of 12 months ending March 31, 1970. (3) An eligible applicant may count as qualified terminal inputs a quantity of No. 2 fuel oil which was delivered into a deep water terminal in District I under his management and operational control or into a deep water terminal with whichthe eligible applicant had a throughputagreement, if he owned the oil when it was placed in the terminal and if the delivery constituted the first delivery of that oil to a deep water terminal in District I. (4) An eligible applicant may count as qualified terminal inputs a quantity of No.. 2 fuel oil which the applicant (W owned and (ii) sold to a person who was not in the business of selling No. 2 fuel oil, and (ii) delivered to a deep water terminal in District I under the manage- ment and operational control of the buyer, if such delivery constituted the first delivery of that oil to a deep water terminal in District I. (5) An eligible applicant may count as qualified terminal inputs a quantity of No. 2 fuel- oil which the applicant (i) owned, (Ii) sold to a Federal agency, or to an agency of a State or a political sub- division of a State, and (ill) delivered to a deep water terminal in District I for the account of such agency, if such delivery constituted the first delivery of that oil to a deep water terminal in District I. (6) For the purposes of this para- graph (f), delivery of No. 2 fuel oil pro- duced in a refinery and placed in storage at that refinery shall not be deemed to be a delivery to a deep water terminal. (g) No allocation made pursuant to this section may be sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred. All No. 2 fuel oil which is imported under an allocation made pursuant to this section must be manufactured in the Western Hemi- sphere from crude oil produced in the Western Hemisphere (North America,Central America, South America, and the West Indies), and shall be sold for use as fuel in District I. (h) As used in this section, \"deep water terminal\" means a permanent land installation which (1) consists of bulk storage tanks having not less than 140,000 barrels of operational capacity, pumps, and pipelines used for the stor- age, transfer and handling of No. 2 fuel oil, and (2) is adjacent to waterways that permit the safe passage to the In- stallation of a tanker rated 16,500 cargo dead weight tons, drawing not less than 30 feet of water, and moored in the berth.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT The hearing on the record of which the proposed amendments, as herein- after set forth, to the tentative market- ing agreements and to the orders as FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 197010154 PROPOSED RULE MAKING amended, were formulated, was con- ducted at Peoria, Ill., May 13, 1970, pur- suant to notices thereof which were issued April 8, 1970 (35 FR. 6009), April 23, 1970 (35 FR. 6712), and April 30, 1970 (35 FPR. 7082). This decision deals only with the issues relating to the handling of milk in the Southern Illinois marketing area. All other issues are reserved for later decision. The material issues on the record of the hearing relating to the Southern Illinois marketing area concern: 1. Diversions of producer milk; and 2. Location adjustments. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS -The following findings and conclusions on the material issues are based on evi- dence presented at the hearing and the record thereof: 1. Diversions of producer milk. The provision relating to the diversion of producer milk should be revised to per- mit diversions in the month of July onthe same basis as now provided for May and June. Presently, the order permits unlimited diversions of producer milk to nonpoolplants that are not other order plants only during the months of May and June.During each of the other months, diver- sions to such plants are limited to 8 days.Diversions between pool plants and to other order plants are allowed eachmonth for not more days of production of a producer than they are physically received at the pool plant from which diverted. Three cooperative associations pro- posed that the month of July be added to the months of unlimited diversions tononpool plants that are not other order plants. They testified that it has been necessary each year since the SouthernIllinois order was promulgated on Jan-uary 1, 1967, to suspend the 8-day limit for the month of July. There was no opposition to this proposal. The provisions for diversion of pro- ducer milk should be related to the re-serve needs of the market. Nearly 1,000. of the 2,429 producers delivering to poolplants regulated under the SouthernIllinois order in December 1969 live in the States of Iowa, Minnesota, and Wis- consin. When milk is not needed at poolplants from these distant producers, it is more efficient to divert' their milk tomanufacturing plants located near their farms. May and June are the months of high-est milk production for the Southern Illinois market. This causes the percent-age of producer milk classified as Class 11 during these 2 months to be among the highest of the year. However, due tothe relatively low volume of Class I sales during July which is attributable, in part, to the closing of schools and factories, the percentage that Class II milk is of total producer receipts in July is higher than it is in May and not significantly lower than it is in June. For example, in 1969 the annual percentage of Class II utilization was 36 while in May it was 43.7, in June 49.8, and in July 44.4. Com- parable patterns also existed in 1967 and1968. May, June, and July are the 3 months of the year when the proportions of producer milk that must be utilized in Class II outlets are the greatest. For the reasons set forth above, it is appropriate to include the month of July along with May and June as a month of unlimited diversions of pro- ducer milk to nonpool plants that are not other order plants. In the briefs filed by several coopera- tive associations, unlimited diversions were requested also for the months of August and December. No testimony was presented at the hearing which would support this request. The record evi- dence does not indicate that the same situation exists in these two months as was described previously with respect to May, June, and July. The proportions of milk utilized as Class II milk in Au- gust and December are significantly lower than in May-July. In fact, during August and December the Class II utili- zation percentages are as low or lower than the yearly average. Thus, the months of unlimited diversions should not be extended to include August and December and the request is denied. An alternative provision to allow di- versions of producer milk during the months of August through April on a percentage basis was suggested at the hearing. However, proponents did not offer any specific examples to demon- strate the need for this type of provision in the Southern Illinois order. Accord- ingly, the suggestion is denied at this time. Another change in the provisions re- lating to transfers and diversions was proposed by cooperatives. Presently, the- order provides for automatic Class I clas- sification of fluid milk products trans- ferred or diverted to nonpool plants lo- cated more than 500 miles from the city hall of Vandalia, Ill. Although -this pro- vision has not interfered with the di- version of producer milk to nonpool plants, it could affect the orderly dispo- sition of reserve milk supplies in the future, especially in view of the substan- tial number of producers delivering to the market who are located in the States of Iowa, Minnesota, -and Wisconsin. Milk must be classified and priced on the basis of the form in which, or the purpose for which, used or disposed of by handlers. Originally, it was considered economically feasible to move milk be- yond the 500-mile limit only if it were intended for Class I use. Because Class II milk brings the same price at all loca- tions, it was uneconomical to transport it long distances for Class II use. How- ever, under today's marketing conditions milk associated with this market might be handled at manufacturing plants lo- cated more than 500 miles from the basing point of Vandalia, -ill. Also, limiting such transfers or diver- sions to Class I earlier tended to save some administrative costs. The cost in- volved in checking utilization at distant plants is less today because the Federal order system is extensive. The 68 Federal milk orders are located throughout the continental United States With exception of a few States, and arrangement forchecking utilization at distant nonpool plants is feasible through the facilities of neighboring market administrators' offices. Accordingly, the order should be amended to remove the automatic Class I classification of -fluid milk products transferred or diverted to nonpool plants located more than 500 miles from Vandalia, Ill. 2. Location adjustments. The provi- sions which establish a location adjust- ment on Class I'milk received at plants located outside the marketing area, and to the uniform price for milk received at such plants, should be revised. The Class I and uniform prices should be reduced 7 cents for milk received at a plant that is located in the Indiana counties ofFountain, Parke, Vermillion, and War- ren. No change would be made with re- spect to the proviso that milk received ata plant located outside the marketing area but in the State of Illinois south ofthe northernmost boundaries of Adams and Schuyler Counties, Ill., shall be sub- ject to the prices applicable in the north-ern zone. Presently, the order provides for 15- cent location adjustment on milk re- ceived at plants located 100 miles or more from the nearest of the three bas- ing points, plus an additional 1.5 cents for each 10 miles or fraction thereof that such distance exceeds 110 miles. Also, there are three pricing zones estab- lished under the Southern Illinois order. The announced Class I and producerblend prices apply to milk received at pool plants located in the base zone. The southern zone Class I and producer blend prices are 7 cents higher than prices in the base zone, while the north- ern zone Class I and producer blend prices are 7 cents lower than prices in the base zone. Producer milk has been diverted in the past from a pool plant located in thenorthern zone to a manufacturing plant located outside the marketing area butin a county adjacent to the northern zone. Such milk was subject to the base zone blend price because the receiving plant is within 100 miles of the nearest of the-three basing points described in the order, all three of which are located in the base zone. The diverted milktherefore was priced at the 7-cent higher base zone price even though the receiv- ing plant was located in an area ad-jacent to the northern zone. Two cooperative associations proposed that the pricing of diverted milk should be at the location of the plant to which delivered, except that such price shouldnot exceed the price applicable at the pool plant from which diverted. This proposal was made to prevent the pay- ment from the pool plant at the higher blend price now payable to the producers whose milk was diverted for manufac- turing use. There was no opposition tothis proposal. While the proposal made would ac- comodate the specific situation described on the record, there is a more appropri- ate method which would have general application. The problem which propo-nents sought to remedy through a FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 197010155 PROPOSED RULE MAKING change In the diversion rules arises be- cause the present location adjustment as it applies in the particular area to which this milk has been diverted is no longer appropriate.Class I and producer blend prices at plants located just outside the northern zone should be at the same level as at plants located within such zone ratherthan 7 cents higher. There is insufficient distance involved to warrant different prices between such locations. The pres-ent price relationship can be corrected by revising the location adjustment pro- visions to include the territory inFountain, Parke, Vermillion, and War-ren Counties, Ind., in the same location price adjustment zone as now applies in the northern zone. This change willcomplement the present-provision which establishes the same price as the north-ern zone price in the Illinois counties that are just west of the northern zone. Accordingly, the order should be so amended. RULINGS ON PROPOSED FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Briefs and proposed findings and con- clusions were filed on behalf of certain interested parties.

Interested persons may participate in the proposed rulemaking by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should be submitted in triplicate to the Chief, Airspace and Program Standards Branch, Federal Aviation Administra- tion, 5651 West Manchester Avenue, Post Office Box 92007, Worldway Postal Cen- ter, Los Angeles, Calif. 90009. All com- munications received within 30 days after publication of this notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER will be considered before action is taken on the proposed amendment. No public hearing is contemplated at this time, but arrangements for informal con- ferences with Federal Aviation Adminis- tration officials may be made by contact- ing the Regional Air Traffic Division Chief. Any data, views, or arguments presented during such conferences must also be submitted in writing in accord- ance with this notice in order to become part of the record for consideration.

A public docket will be available for examination by interested persons in the office of the Regional Counsel, Federal Aviation Administration, 5651 West Manchester Avenue, Los Angeles, Calif. 90045. A review of the controlled airspace re-* quirements for Colorado Springs, Colo., has indicated a need for redesignation of the airspace in the Canon City, Colo. area. That airspace currently floored at 10,700 is proposed to beamended to a floor of 1,200 feet above the surface. The portion in the vicinity of Canon City is proposed to be floored at 11,700 feet MSL. These alterations are necessary to provide maximum radar capability and vectoring at the lowest available altitudes in the Canon City area for arriving/departing aircraft inthe Colorado Springs terminal area. In consideration of the foregoing, FAA proposes the following airspace action. In \u00a7 71.181 (35 F.R. 2134) the descrip-' tion of the Colorado Springs, Colo., transition area Is amended as follows: In the 10th line delete all after \"* * * 307' radial;\" and substitute therefor ,\"that airspace southwest of ColoradoSprings bounded on the north by a line beginning at latitude 38\u00b035\"00\", N., longi- tude 105\u00b010'00\" W. to latitude 38\u00b040'00\" N., longitude 104052'00\" W., on the east by longitude 104\u00b052\"001, W., on the south by the north edge of V-244 and on the west by longitude 105\u00b010'0011 W.; that airspace southwest and northwest of Colorado Springs extending upwards from 11,700 feet MSL bounded on the north by a line beginning at latitude 38'- 30'00\" N., longitude 105127'00'\" W., to latitude 38\u00b035'00\" N., longitude 105\u00b010'- 00\" W.; on the east by longitude 105\u00b010'- 00\" W., on the south by the north edge of V-244 and on the west by longitude 105'27'00\" W. and that airspace bounded on the north by latitude 39\u00b005'00\" N., on the northeast by a line 5 miles south- west of and parallel to the ColoradoSprings VORTAC 3070 radial on the east by longitude 104'52'00\" W., on the south by latitude 38655'00' N., andl on the west by longitude 105\u00b020'00\" W.\" This amendment is proposed under the authority of section 307(a) of the Fed- eral Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1348(a)), and of section 6(c) of the Department of Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 1655(c) ).

Interested persons may submit such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should be submitted in triplicate to the Chief, Air Traffic Division, Southwest Region, Fed- eral Aviation Administration, Post Office Box 1689, Fort Worth, Tex. 76101. All communications received within 30 days after publication of this notice in the FEDERAL REGISTEa will be considered be- fore action is taken on the proposed amendment. No public hearing is con- templated at this time, but arrangements for informal conferences with Federal Aviation Administration officials may be made by contacting the Chief, Air Traffic Division. Any data, views, or arguments presented during such conferences must also be submitted in writing in accord- ance with this notice in order to become part of the record for consideration. The proposal contained in this notice may be changed in the light of comments received. The official docket will be available for examination by interested persons at the Office of the Regional Counsel, South- west Region, Federal Aviation Adminis- tration, Fort Worth, Tex. An informal docket will also be available for examina- tion at the Office of the Chief, Air Traffic Division. There are many areas of uncontrolled airspace, ranging from very small to large, and several segments of controlled airspace with floors higher than 1,200 feet above the surface within the State of New Mexico. These areas are sur- rounded by or they are adjacent to either Federal airways or transition areas 3vith floors of 1,200 feet above the surface. Because of the increasing traffic volume and the -demand for air traffic control services, there is a need to include many of these areas within the proposed New Mexico transition area. More efficient FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 197010157 PROPOSED RULE MAKING air traffic services, including radar in some areas, could be provided without the restrictions imposed by small irregu- lar areas of uncontrolled airspace which cannot be easily discerned on essential aeronautical charts. Inclusion of these areas within the proposed New Mexico transition area would, in fact, lessen the burden on the public and it would incur no apparent derogation to VFR operations. To simplify airspace descriptions, pro- vide continuity of the floors of con- trolled airspace, and to improve chart legibility, the following airspace actions are proposed: 1. Designate the New Mexico transi- tion area as follows: NEW MExICO That airspace extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface within the boundary of the State of New Mexico, ex- cluding that airspace north of a line be- ginning on the Arizona/New Mexico State line at lat. 35\u00b031'00\"' N., thence to lat.35*52'00\" N., long. 108*47'00\" W., to lat. 35*47'30\" N., long. 108*34'00\" W., thence along long. 108034'00\" W., to and along the north boundary of V-291N to and clockwise along the arc of a 46-mile radius circle cen- tered. at the Albuquerque VORTAC to lat.35\u00b037'35\" N., long. 106\u00b024'48\" W., to lat. 35*47'00'' N., long. 106\u00b015'00\" W., to lat. 35\u00b047'00'' N., long. 105\u00b050'00\" W., thence along long. 105\u00b050'00' W., to and along the north boundary of V-19 to long. 105\u00b016'30\" W., to lat. 3600'001 N., long. 10507'00\" W., thence along lat. 36\u00b000'00\" N., to and along the north boundary of V-190 to the New Mexico/Texas State line, excluding R-5101, R-5107B, R-5107C and the portidn of R- 5107A north of lat. 32\u00b018'00' N., excluding that airspace bounded by a line beginningon the Arizona/New Mexico State line at lat. 34-18'00\" N., thence to the south bound- ary of V-264 at long. 108\u00b054'00' W., thence along the south boundary of V-264 to and south along long. 107\u00b000'00\" W. to and along the northwest boundary of V-19 to lat. 3335100' N., to lat. 333500' N., long. 107\u00b020'00\" W., to the northwest boundary of V-202 at long. 107\u00b025'00 W., thence along the northwest boundary of V-202 to lat. 32-59O00' N., to lat. 32-35'00\" N., long. 10837'00' W., to the Arizona/New Mexico State line at lat. 3225'00'' N., thence along the State line to point of beginning, ex- cluding that airspace south of V-66, and ex- cluding that airspace below 11,500 feet MSL bounded by a line beginning at lat. 33\u00b043'30\" N., long. 105\u00b009'00\" W., thence to lat. 33017'- 10\" N., long. 105009'00\" 33010'20\" N., long. 105\u00b038'00'' W., thence counter- clockwise along the arc of a 35-mile radius circle centered at lat. 32\u00b051104'\" N., long. 10606'05\" W., to and along long. 10604'00\" W., to and along the south boundary of V-264 to long. 105\u00b050'30\" W., thence to point of beginning. 2.

A copy of the record pertaining to this decision is available for public reviewduring ordinary business hours of the Department of Commerce, at the Scien-NOTICES tifle Instrument Evaluition Division, De-partment of Commerce, Washington, D.C. Docket No. 70-00532-33-46500. Appli- cant: National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, 10, Room 8B14, use of article: The article will be used for the study of biological specimens of tumor and animal origin, virus particles, and membrane structures. The development of tumor cells and the development of viruses in mammalian tissues will also be studied. Since the ap- plicant's researci deals with tissue cul- tures and surgical materials, section thickness of 50-100 angstroms and a widerange of cutting speeds are important, Comments: No comments have been received with respect to this application. Decision: Application approved. Noinstrument or apparatus of equivalent scientific value to the foreign article, for such purposes as this article is intended to be used, was being manufactured inthe United States at the time tho appli- cant placed the order for the foreign article. Reasons: We note that captioned ap- plication is a resubmission of Docket No. 70-00030-33-46500 which was received on July 10, 1969, at which time the ap-plicant indicated that it had already placed an order for the foreign article. The most closely comparable domestic instrument available when the originalapplication was received, was the Model MT-2 ultramicrotome which is being manufactured by Ivan Sorvall, Inc. (Sor- vall). The foreign article provides a spec- ified minimum thickness capability of 50 angstroms, whereas the Sorvall Model MT-2 provides a specified minimum thickness capability of 100 angstroms. The thinner the section, the more is it possible to take advantage of the utmost resolving capability of the electron microscope under which the specimen will be examined. The ability to achieve the highest possible resolution is neces-sary to accomplishing the purposes for which the specimens will be prepared and, consequently, the lower minimum thickness capability of the foreign article is a pertinent characteristic. We, there- fore, find that the Sorvall MT-2 is not of equivalent scientific value to the for- eign article for such purposes as this article is intended to be used. The Department of Commerce knows of no other instrument or apparatus of equivalent scientific value to the foreignarticle, for such purposes as this article is intended to be used, which was being manufactured in the United States at the time the applicant placed the order for the article.

The response to the announcement did noj contain information to fully support the label claims, and available information still fails to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness of the drugs for their recommended use in the treatment of dermatomycosis and nonspecific derma- tosis in small and large animals. Therefore, notice is given to Jensen- Salsbery Laboratories, and to any in- terested person who may be adversely af- fected, that the Commissioner of Food and Drugs proposes to issue an order un- der the provisions of section 512(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(e)) withdrawing ap- proval of new. animal drug applications Nos. 8-177V and 9-602V and all amend- ments and supplements thereto held by Jensen-Saisbery Laboratories for the drugs Cycloderm Creme and Cycloderm Lotion on the grounds-,that: Information before the Commissioner with respect to the drugs, evaluated together with the evidence available to him when the applications 'were ap- proved, does not provide substantial evidence that the drugs have the effect they purport or are represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their labeling.

PromulgationNOTICES of the order will cause any drug similar in composition to and recommended for the same conditions of use as Cycloderm Creme and Cycloderm Lotion to be a new animal drug for which an approved new animal drug application is not in effect. Any such drug then on the market would be subject to regulatory proceedings.

If such persons elect not to avail them- selves of the opportunity for a hearing, the Commissioner without further notice will enter a final order withdrawing the approval of the new animal drug applications. Failure of such persons to file a writ- ten appearance of election within 30 days following date of publication of this no- tice in the FEDERAL REGISTER will be con- strued as an election by such persons not to avail themselves of the opportu- nity for a hearing. The hearing contemplated by this no- tice will be open to the public except that any portion of the hearing that con- cerns a method or process which the Commissioner finds is entitled to pro- tection as a trade secret will not be open to the public, unless the respondent specifies otherwise in his appearance. If such persons elect to avail them- selves of the opportunity for a hearing,they must file a written appearance re- questing the hearing and giving the rea- sons .why approval of the new animal drug application should not be with- drawn, together with a well-organized and full-factual analysis of the clinical and other investigational data they are prepared to prove in support of their opposition. A request for a hearing may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and substantial Is- sue of fact that requires a hearing. When it clearly appears from the data in the application and from the reasons and factual analysis in the request for the hearing that there is xfo genuine and sub- stantial issue of fact which precludes the withdrawal of approval of the applica- tion, the Commissioner will enter an or- der on these data, making findings and conclusions on such data. If a hearing is requested and is justified by the re- sponse to the notice of hearing, the is- sues will be defined, a hearing examiner will be named, and he shall issue a writ- ten notice of the timq and place at which the hearing will commence, not more than 90 days after the expiration of such 30 da s unless the hearing examiner and the applicant otherwise agree.

[F.R. Doc. 70-7824; Filed, June COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION [Docket No. 18875; FCC 70-6201 LICENSING OF FACILITIES FOR OVERSEAS COMMUNICATIONS Notice of Inquiry 1. By separate letters of August 5, 1969 to American Telephone and Tele- graph Company (A.T. & T.) and to Com- munications Satellite Corp. (Comsat), the Commissioni, noting the rapid de- velopments in overseas communications and the ever-growing demand for facili- ties, requested certain information as to each company's present and planned ac- tivities regarding research and develop- ment with respect to cables (A.T. & T.) and satellites (Comsat). By reply of August 22, A.T. & T., among other things \"strongly urged that the Commission consider the practicability of devising new procedures for granting preliminary approval\" of new cable requests \"so that the carriers may proceed with some as- surance in working out the myriad of details which are necessary before formal requirements for authorizations can be filed.\" Similarly, Comsat, In its reply of September 4, 1969, endorsed an early consideration of the issues Involved in the establishment of a U.S. policy for the assignment of total traffic between cables, satellites, and other overseas communications facilities. 2. Thereafter, by letter of Septem- ber 18, 1969, to A.T. & T. we noted that both replies raised substantial questions of policy requiring careful consideration, and indicated that we intended to Initiate action looking to a resolution of those questions. We are now prepared to take such adtion, and are therefore initiating this inquiry pursuant to the Communi- cations Act, sections 403, 4(1), 214, and Title III, Part I, and the Communications Satellite Act, section 201 (c). 3. We think that, to the extent pos- sible, we should formulate a policy which will govern our future licensing in the field of overseas communications and which will enable interested carriers toplan their own actions accordingly. Such action, rather than separate actions on an ad hoc basis, will be more conducive to the effective discharge of our statu- tory responsibilities, set out in the Com- munications Act, which, among other things, are designed to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, world- wide wire and radio communication serv- ice with adequate facilities at reasonable charges; and at the same time effectuate our responsibilities under the Communi- cations Satellite Act in light of the ob- jectives and policies set out in that Act. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 197010M6 NOTICES 4. In this connection, we note that the pace of technological progress in over- seas communications has increased in recent years and promises to continue without abatement. These advances have been evidenced by the introduction in the mid-1950's of high-capacity long-dis- tance submarine cables, and the intro- duction in the mid-1960's of the first commercial communications satellite. Improvements in submarine cables have resulted in successive increases in ca- pacity, so that the most recent cable we authorized has a capacity of some 800 voice-circuits as compared to a 36 voice- circuit capacity in the first such cable. Progress in the development of communications satellites has been even more rapid-froni a nominal 240 voice-circuit capacity in the first gen- eration-Intelsat I-satellite, there is now a capacity of over 1,000 voice- circuits in Intelsat 311 satellite now in use, With the expectation of over 5,000 circuits in the next series of satellites scheduled for operation in 1971. More- over, in 1965 we had satellite coverage on a two-point basis over the Atlantic Basin in the northern hemisphere whereas to- day, with several satellites providing At- lantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean basin coverage to numerous earth stations in each ocean basin on a multiple access _basis, there is the true global coveragecontemplated by the Communications Satellite Act. 5. Increases in the use of overseas com-munications services have, of course, ac- companied technical progress. The use of high-capacity -transatlantic cables hasincreased from some 36 voice-circuits in 1956 to over 700 circuits in 1970, and At- lantic basin satellite use has increased from less than 100 voice-circuits in 1965 to over 800 circuits today. Similar in- creases have occurred in other areas. De- mand for conventional services is ex- pected to continue to grow at at least the same very rapid rate, and with the in- creasing use of new overseas services such as television and real-time high-speed data, the requirements for capacity are expected to in the future increase even more sharply. 6. The increasing complexity of com- munications underscores the need for a Commission review of facilities planning. We recognize that the U.S. carriers are aware of their obligations to the public and continually review the adequacy of existing facilities and the desirability or need to either replace such facilities with more modern facilities or to supplement them with additional facilities. We think our present inquiry can provide a per- spective for such planning through the next decade to 1980, and we propose to employ our licensing process in suchmanner as to be conducive to efficient planning by the carriers, including Com- sat, and their foreign correspondents. 7. A.T. & T., in its letter of August 22, has indicated it proposes a policy of di- versification in facilities and routing. It believes that the development of high- capacity cables and satellites has reduced per circuit costs to the point where it will soon be feasible to provide neededcapacity to meet unexpected peak de- mands, growth, and to restore circuits lost because of facilities failures. Not- ing the transatlantic communications growth is such that, without additional cables, an imbalance between satellite and cable circuits will develop after the next few years, it proposes that a 720- circuit cable be installed with France as soon as practicable, i.e., 1972-73. It also proposes a similar cable between the mainland and Hawaii in the early 1970's with extensions to Australia and the western Pacific thereafter. It also points out that larger-capacity cables will be available in the mid-1970's at which time it proposes to add ,a new cable to Europe about 1976, and may add cables to the Caribbean and Pacific in 1980. In its letter it points out that it is develop- ing a 3,000-circuit cable for use in the mid-1970's, and that the United King- dom has developed an 1,800-circuit cable which, with appropriate modification, might be available for transatlantic use by the mid-1970's. 8. Comsat, in its September 4 reply, indicated that the Intelsat constortium undertakes technological investigations so as to be able to take advanced steps whenever they are justified by the quan- tity of traffic, the type of traffic, or the status of new developments, and that a new generation of satellites available in the later 1970's may be capable of providing 20,000 to 30,000 circuits, with a maximum degree of redundancy to achieve the highest standards of relia- bility and useful lifetime. Comsat states that research is being conducted which will result in tremendous gains in the refinement of operational techniques, qualitative extension and diversification of service, increases in reliability and consequent significant financial savings to users. In commenting on the A.T. & T. reply, Comsat noted its disagreement with the proposed A.T. & T. program, and suggested that a review be made of the various viewpoints and a policy be es- tablished for the assignment of total traffic between cables, satellites, and other international communications fa- cilities. Specifically, Comsat alleged that A.T. & T. did not deal with the economic considerations basic to the definition of a \"reasonable balance\" between cables and satellites, e.g., whether investment in cables is justified if there is excess satellite capacity, the extent to which cables on high-density routes will in- crease satellite costs on routes to the rest of the world, the need for diversity of cable and satellite facilities, and the relative economies of cables and satel- lites. It also raised questions as to the need for sustaining A.T. & T. cable -manufacturing capability, and the rela- tionship of any licensing policy to the U.S. objectives for the global satellite system. 9. By letter of November 14, 1969, the Office of Telecommunications Manage- ment (OTM), commented on this mat- ter, stressing that reliability of service is vital to the Government in time of crisis, and essential to the commercial Interests and the general public. OTlM advocated an approach which would regard cablesand satellites as complementary rather than competitive as recognized by the Commission and incorporated in the TAT-5 and Virgin Islands-Puerto Rico arrangements. OTM felt that the wisdom of such approach was demonstrated by restoration activities occasioned by re- cent cable and satellite failures. It felt that the respective qualities of satellites and cables required their use in balanced quantities for maximum availability and reliability of service, and to afford ade- quate restoration capability in event of failure of either media. 10. As may be seen, there are a num- ber of factors which must be evaluated in the formation of an appropriate policy. In particular, consideration must be given to the following: (a) That there is a growing need for new and expanded overseas communica- tions facilities and services; (b) That cable and satellite technol- ogy may each be expected to develop new and improved applications with substan- tial public benefits in the form of im- proved and expanded service at lower costs and that any policy must be suffi- ciently flexible to accommodate unfore- seen developments; (c) That this nation is committed by the Communications Satellite Act to a policy establishing and maintaining a global communications satellite system as part of improved global communica- tions network and in implementing this commitment through participation in the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium; (d) That the Communications Satel- lite Act states the intent of Congress that Comsat be so organized and operated as to maintain and strengthen competition in the provision of communication serv- ices to the public; and (e) That the touchstone for Commis- sion licensing actions is the mandate set out in section 1 of the Communications Act of 1934 to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, nationwide and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reason- able charges. 11. In the context of the foregoing factors, and for the guidance of those concerned with this inquiry, we are setting out below the areas in which we seek specific information and com- ment. To the extent applicable, each carrier participating in overseas com- munications should address itself to those items applicable to it. Such car- riers, as well as any other person com- menting herein, may of course address any other area of relevance, and we encourage such comment. We shall undertake to promptly review com- ments and replies and as soon there- after as possible indicate our next step in this matter, so as to avoid any undue delay in the addition of needed facilities. 12. In reaching a determination the Commission may take into considera- tion any other relevant information before it. Comments should be filed by August 16, 1970, with replies thereto being filed by September 21, 1970.

Comment as to the desirability of encouraging competition between Comsat and carriers providing service through media other than satellite, and the manner In which such competition may be encouraged, including customer choice of media (see sec- tion 102(c) of the Communications Satellite Act). Should the Commission modify its au- thorized user policy? If so, give reasons there- for, and the modifications which should be made. Should Comsat serve the public di- rt tly for television, leased line, and broad- band services? Any other services? If so, should such *services be provided only on routes which have both satellite and other media? Should there be any effect on earthstation ownership policy? Discuss the effect on reliability, quality, efficiency, and cost of service, responsiveness to customer needs, etc. Assuming additional cables are authorized, to what extent should the Commission re- quire that carriers other than Comsat meettheir service needs through satellites.

Memorandum Opinion and Order Enlarging and Modifying Issues In re applications of Day-Nite Radio Message Service Corp., Docket No. 18826, File No. 731-C2-R-69, for renewal of li- dense of domestic public land mobile ra- dio station KGA-593, Philadelphia, Pd.; and Radio iSroadeasting Co., Docket No. 18827, File No. 439-C2-P-(2)-70, for new facilities in the domestic public land mo- bile radio service in Philadelphia, Pa. 1. This proceeding involves the appli- cation of Day-Nite Radio Message Serv- ice Corp. (Day-Nite) for renewal of license of domestic public land mobile radio station KGA-593, Philadelphia, Pa., and the mutually-exclusive appli- cation of Radio Broadcasting Co. (RBC) for new facilities in Philadelphia, Pa. RBC is presently a licensee of station KGB-874 and is seeking additional facili- ties operating on the frequencies now as- signed to KGA-593. By memorandum opinion and order, FCC 70-340, 22 FCC 2d 270, released April 7, 1970, the Com- mission designated the applications for hearing on the following three issues: (1) To determine with respect to Day- Nite's renewal application: (a) The nature and extent of the serv- ices currently offered by Day-Nite, including rates, practices, personnel, and facilities available. (b) Whether, in light of (a), Day-Nite has and is conducting its operation effi- ciently, and if not, whether there are any future plans to develop the potentiality of the facility. (c) Whether Day-Nite violated any of the requirements of the Commission's rules, specifically with respect to \u00a7\u00a7 21.208 (e) and (g), 21.213, 21.515(b) and, if so, the impact of such violations on the qualifications of Day- Nite to be a DPLMRS licensee. (d) Whether any changes requiring Commission authorization were made without first securing such authorization. (2) To determine with respect to the application filed by RBC: (a) The nature and extent of the service proposed to be offered by RBC including rates, practices, personnel, and facilities to be made available. (b) Whether RBC, in keeping with the provisions of \u00a7 21.516 of the rules, has evidenced sufficient need for the addi- tional frequency. (3) To determine, in light of the evi- dence adduced pursuant to the fore- going issues, which, if either, of the ap- plications should be granted. Presently before the Review Board is a motion for enlargement of issues, filed Apr. 27, 1970, by RBC I seeking the modi- I Also before the Review Board are: (a) Common Carrier Bureau's comments, filed May 8, 1970; (b) opposition, filed May 12, 1970, by Day-Nite; and (c) reply, filed May 21, 1970, by RBC.fication of issues 1(c) and 2(b), and the addition of a character qualifications issue against Day-Nite. Modification of issue 1(c). 2. RBC states that, as a result of inspections of Day-Nite's station by the Commission's Field Engineering Bureau, official notices were issued indicating possible violations of 11 of the Commission's rules. Paragraph 5 of the designation order states this fact and lists the 11 pos- sible rules violations. RBC notes, how- ever, that the issue pertaining to the matter (Issue 1 (c)) lists only nine of the rules allegedly violated, omitting Rules 21.107(c) and 21.205(o). RBC maintains that both of these possible violations are serious and, accordingly, that Issue 1 (c) should be drawn broadly enough to per- mit inquiry into these infractions, as well as those listed. The Common Carrier Bureau, in its comments, indicates that it has no objection to a grant of the request. Day-Nite, in oppesition, -argues that \"not one fact\" is offered in support of the requested modification, and that RBC contents itself with conclusory as- sertions. Day-Nite further states that RBC has not contended that the Com- mission was unaware of the relevant circumstances, nor has it shown any new facts. Moreover, Day-Nite asserts, not only is there no basis for adding the is- sues requested, but the Review Board is affirmatively precluded from specifying such new issues, citing Atlantic Broad- casting Co., 5 FCC 2d 717, 8 RR 2d 991 (1966). In reply, RBC argues that the listing of the possible violations of Rules 21.107(c) and 21.205(o) by the Commis- sion in the designation order is a suffi- cient basis for \"broadening the issue\" to permit an inquiry into \"all possible vio- lations\" of the Commission's rules dis- closed by the Commission's inspections. 3. The Review Board agrees with RBC and the Common Carrier Bureau that Issue 1(c) should be modified as. re- quested. The failure of the Commission to list the above-mentioned rules in Is- sue 1(c) appears to have been merely an oversight, especially in light of the fact that the rules were specified with particularity in paragraph 5 of the desig- nation order. The omission is not fatal to RBC's request, as Day-Nite argues. Since there is no indication in the designation order of why the Commission listed the possible rule violations in the body of the designation order, but did not in- clude them in the specified issues, the Board does not believe that the rationale of the Atlantic case, supra, is applicable here. Since Issue l(c) is designed to in- quire into the requisite qualifications of Day-Nite to be a Commission licensee, it would, in the Board's opinion, be ap- propriate to add the omitted sections of the rules so that all necessary informa- tion will be obtained at the hearing. Modification o1 issue 2(b). 4. RBC contends that Issue 2(b), as presently framed, appears to limit the needs in- quiry to the showing required by Commission Rule 21.516 only. In mov- ant's view, the basic question in this proceeding is the broader one encom- passed by Item 52 of the FCC Form401, which seeks facts showing how the proposal will be in the public interest and how it will satisfy the need for the proposed service. RBC argues that such a showing should include, but should not be limited to, the specific elements listed in Rule 21.516. Petitioner submits that Rule 21.516 contemplates showings as to need beyond the traffic study specif- ically required by \u00a7 21.516, that the Bureau accepts such showings of need, and that the hearing orders which in- volve questions of need are drawn with sufficient breadth to permit need show- ings beyond the mere traffic study (citing Able Paging Service, 8 FCC 2d, 412, 10 RR 2d 167 (1967): and Long Island Pag- ing, 20 FCC 2d 519 (1969)). RBC there- fore urges that Issue 2(b) be redrawn to permit a full comparison of the need for the services of the respective appli- cants, and that an appropriate issue be added to permit it to show the areas and populations which it proposes to serve within its service contours. The Common Carrier Bureau does not oppose the requested modification of Issue 2(b), and supports the addition of issues which would permit showings of areas and populations presently, or proposed to be, served by both applicants. In opposition, Day-Nite alleges that RBC did not make an effective showing that the Commis- sion failed to conslder the matters now urged or that new facts exist which would justify altering the Commission's judgment. RBC's mere disagreement with the Commission's formulation of Issue 2(b), Day-Nite asserts, is an in- sufficient basis for the Board to modify the Commission's designation order in any respect, and, in the absence of the type of showing required by Atlantic Broadcasting, supra, there are no grounds for radically redesigning a pur- posely narrow \"need\" issue into the broad comparative issue requested. In reply, RBC argues that a broadly framed needs issue is \"absolutely essential to a full, fair adjudication of the ultimate question whether to award the channel to RBC or Day-Nite.\" The requested areas and populations issue, states movant, is ancillary to the requested broadened issue. 5. In the Review Board's opinion, Is- sue 2 (b) should be modified as requested by RBC. In Atlantic Broadcasting Co., supra, 5 FCC 2d at 721, 8 RR 2d at 996, the Commission held, with regard to re- quests to enlarge or modify issues, that \"where the designation order contains no reasoned analysis with respect to the merits of that particular matter, the subordinate official should make such an analysis and rule on the merits of the petition so that the hearing may be con- ducted in an orderly and expeditious manner.\" A reading of the designation order in this proceeding reveals no \"rea- soned analysis\" of the matter raised by RBC in its motion (i.e., a broadly framed \"needs\" issue). Rather, in our opinion, Issues l(a), 2(a), and 3, when read to- gether, indicate that a full comparative analysis of both proposals is what the Commission intended. To alleviate any doubts, however, we will modify the FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 35, NO. 120-STURDAY, JUNE 20, 1970 No. 120--510169 NOTICES issue in line with RBC's request. Modi- fying the issue thusly would not, as Day- Nite argues, be contrary to the intent of the Commission; it Would be consistent with our view of that intent, and would best.serve the public interest by permit- ting a complete determination of \"which, if either, of the applications should be granted.\" Issue 3. Thus, it would be desirable to elicit evidence at the hearing which would permit a full com- parison of the competing proposals in assessing the need for the best possible service to the public. Cf. Able Paging Service, supra. In this regard, additional issues will be added to permit the appli- cants to show the areas and populations presently served by Day-Nite and pro- posed to be served by RBC, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 21.504. Character qualifications issue. 6. RBC states that, in its July 30, 1969, petition to deny Day-Nite's application, it (RBC) charged that Day-Nite, in an effort to conceal its failure to properly monitor its control point, as required by the Commis- sion's rules, sought to persuade others to make fraudulent log entries; and that RBC had substantiated this charge in two affidavits submitted to the Commis- sion, one by letter dated June 26, 1969, and the other in a reply pleading filed on November 14, 1969. Movant further claims that the Commission, in dispens- ing with further consideration of RBC's charge, relied upon Day-Nite's affidavit by letter dated July 17, 1969. RBC avers that, from the Commission's recital of facts in paragraph 5 of the designation order, \"it almost appears that the Com- mission was unaware of [RBC'sl last affidavit.\" RBC argues that the truth of the accusation is in part corroborated by the Commission's own inspections which apparently revealed failures to log and failures to monitor. RBC thus urges that an issue be added to determine whether Mrs. Markovitz, Day-Nite's principal owner, sought others to make fraudulent log entries. Day-Nite, in opposition, al- leges that both documents alluded to by RBC were offered to the Commission before; and that the Commission spe- cifically rejected RBC's arguments and the import of those affidavits in the des- ignation order. Day-Nite contends that since RBC has shown neither that the Commission did not fully consider the matter nor any new facts in this regard, a grant of the requested issue is barred by Atlantic Broadcasting supra. The Common Carrier Bureau, in its -com- ments, states that the contents of both affidavits were duly considered by the Commission, as was the information con- tained in the affidavit submitted on be- half of Day-Nite, and that, on the basis of all of the information contained- in all of these documents,' it was deter- mined that any further consideration of this contention was unwarranted. Suf- ficient latitude exists, -the Bureau de- clares, under Issues 1(c), as modified, and 1(d) to permit'the necessary and appropriate inquiry to be made concern- ing any possible failure by Day-Nite to log and/or to monitor its existing facility.7. RBC's request for a character issue against Day-Nite will be denied. The matter was fully considered by the Com- mission in the designation order, Atlan- tic Broadcasting, supra, and movant has presented no new allegations to substan- tiate its request for a disqualifying issue. At footnote one to the designation order, the Commission listed the pleadings under consideration by it; included were RBC's petition to deny, filed August 29, 1969, and RBC's reply, filed November 14, 1969. Thus, there is no basis for RBC's statement that theCommission was un- aware of all of its allegations and sup- porting affidavits. In this regard, it has recently been held that the Commis- sion need not mention each and every fact considered by it in reaching a con- clusion. DuPage County Broadcasting, Inc., FCC 70-492, released May 15, 1970, 35 FR 8320, 8321. Further, at paragraph -5 of the designation order the Commis- sion stated that: \"On the basis of an affidavit submitted on behalf of Day- Nite on July 17, 1969, we find unwar- ranted any further consideration of RBC's claim that Day-Nite attempted to persuade others to falsify records.\" The fact that the Commission rejected Day- Nite's allegations with respect to this matter in spite of the conflicting Affi- davits does not necessarily indicate that the Commission ovelooked the conflict, as RBC suggests in its reply. Finally, as the Bureau states, there is sufficient lati- tude under Issue 1(c), as modified, and Issue 1(d), to permit an inquiry into the alleged failure of Day-Nite to log and/or monitor its station. 8. Accordingly, it is ordered, That the motion for enlargement of issues, filed April 27, 1970, by Radio Broadcasting Co. is granted to the extent indicated below and is denied in all other respects; and 9. It is further ordered, That the hear- ing issues are enlarged by addition of the following issue: 1(e) The areas and populations now served by Day-Nite in accordance with \u00a7 21.504 of the rules and the need and demand for the service of Station KGA- 593. 10. It is further ordered, That Issues 1(c) and 2(b), as specified in the desig- nation order herein, are modified to read as follows: 1 (c) Whether Day-Nite violated any of the requirements of the Commis- sion's rules, specifically if so, the impact of such violations on the qualifications of Day-Nite to be a DPLMRS licensee. 2(b) The present and proposed areas and populations within RBC's present and proposed contours in .accordance with \u00a7 21.504 of the rules, and the needs and demands for--the service on the present and additional frequency in said proposed areas. *11. It is further ordered, That Day- Nite Radio Message Service Corp. shall have the burdeiis of proceeding and proof with respect to Issue I (e).Adopted: June 10, 1970.

FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 197010170 NOTICES male minors in August of 1966, allegedly obscene moving pictures and whether such event led to the issuance of a search warrant on or about August 29, 1966, to search that principal's home, and whether that principal made improper sexual advances or otherwise acted im-properly with respect to male minors visiting his house on or about August 17, 1966; ' to determine whether Home Serv- ice has misrepresented its programing plans to the Commission with respect to the use of automated programing; to determine whether Home Service en-gaged in further construction of its pro- posed station after the Commission had stayed the effectiveness of the construc- tion permit previously issued to Home Service; and to determine whether the rate card proposed to be issued by Home Service was deceptive as to prospective advertisers and unfair as to other local broadcast stations. Home Service, in its motion to enlarge issues, requests the addition of the following issue against Natick: To determine the facts and circum- stances surrounding the preparation and execution of affidavits by [Afflant A] l dated November 21, 1969 and by [Affiant B] dated November 28, 1969 and fled with the Commission by Natick Broad- cast Associates, Inc., and to determine, based on these facts and circumstances, whether Natick Broadcast Associates, Inc., and its principal Leon M. Fox pos- sess the requisite character qualifica- tions to be a licensee of the Commission. Timeliness of NaticL's motion to en- large issues. 2. Natick concedes that its motion to enlarge does not comply with the time limitation set forth in \u00a7 1.229 (b) of the Commission's rules. However, Natick asserts that its tardiness was un- avoidable since Mr. Leon M. Fox \" did not learn of the existence of the search war- rant that prompted this request until May or June of 1969, and since he was unable to read the written affidavit sup- porting the search warrant until Sep- tember 26, 1969. This delay, Natick con- tends, was due to Fox's unfamiliarity with procedures in criminal cases-he had never, prior to May or June of 1969, read a search warrant and did not know that an affidavit was required in support thereof. In further support of Natick's contention that good cause for late filing A This issue differs from the issue originally requested by Natick; it was revised and ex- panded by Natick's supplement to its mo-tion to enlarge issues, filed Dec. 3, 1969. This issue, as well as the other issues requested by Natick, also requires a determination ofthe effect of the evidence adduced on the basic or comparative qualifications of Home Service to be a licensee. 5 In view of the fact that two of the affiants herein appear to have been minors at thetime of the alleged incident to which they affirm, the Board is of the view that it would be appropriate to refer to these personsmerely as Affiants A and B. Also, in light of the nature of the allegations, the Board has seen fit not to divulge the identity of Home Service's principal. OLcon AT. Fox is a stockholder and clerk (secretary) of Natick, and is general counsel for Natick; he has held these positions since the corporation's inception.is present, it points to recent changes in its communications counsel. Finally, Natick submits that, even-if good cause for the late filing is not found, it would be in the public interest for the Board to consider the merits of the proposed is- sues, in light of the \"graveness\" of the matters raised, citing The Edgefield- Saluda Radio Co., 5 FCC 2d 148, 8 R 2d 611 (1966). 3. Home Service counters that all the facts on which the pleading is based were known to, or should have been known by, Natick through the exercise of even a modicum of diligence and that the retention of different communications counsel is not an adequate basis for con- sidering these tardy requests. Home Service contends that it is \"incredible\" that Fox, a practicing lawyer for over 18 years, did not know that an affidavit is required in support of a search warrant in Massachusetts;7 that Natick has failed to meet Rule 1.229(c) requisites;8 and, finally, that the Edgefield-Saluda doctrine is not applicable here since there is no \"substantial likelihood\" that, any of the allegations have any bearing on the character qualifications of Home Service or of its principals. The Broad- cast Bureau, although not convinced that Natick exercised \"reasonable diligence\" in the filing of its request, is of the opin- ion that, under Edgefield-Saluda, it is appropriate to consider the public in-, terest questions raised. In reply, Natick reasserts that it acted with all due dili- gence and that, in any event, the motion should be considered pursuant to the mandate of Edgefield-Saluda. 4. The Review Board is of the opinion that no persuasive showing of good cause has been made sufficient to justify the untimely filing of Natick's request. We are unconvinced that Natick's general counsel, in practice for over 18 years, was not cognizant of the fact that a search warrant must be supported by an affidavit. Since the existencu of the search warrant was discovered in May or June of 1969, Natick had 3 to 4 months, prior to the deadline for filing petitions to enlarge, to timely file the enlargement request. It is apparent that the facts on which the pleadings are based could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable dili- gence at a much earlier time. Equally un- availing is Natick's claim concerning the retention of new counsel. Natick has been represented by counsel throughout this proceeding and cannot now avoid the ef- fects of lack of diligence by asserting that it has changed counsel for the third time. The Board also concurs with Home Service that the request for character issues does not meet the test set forth in the Edgefield-Saluda case, since the likelihood of proving these allegations are not so substantial as to outweigh the 7Such an affidavit has apparently been required n support of a search warrant sincethe adoption of the Massachusetts Constitu- tion in 1780. s These requirements were subsequently met by additional pleadings filed by Natick in support of its requested issues, which in- cluded supporting affidavits of those with personal knowledge of the facts.10171 public interest benefits inherent in the orderly and fair administration of the Commission's business. However, the af- fidavits attached in support of the ap- plicants' respective pleadings raise seri- ous public interest questions, due to the apparent contradictory statements con- tained therein, which necessitate our consideration of all matters raised bythe pleadings. Although the remaining issues requested by Natick are similarly untimely and involve much less serious public interest questions, we will, never- theless, consider the merits of these re- quests in order to avoid any further de- lay in the prosecution of this proceeding.Character and misrepresentation is- sues. 5. A brief summary of the manner in which the issues requested in this pro- ceeding arose may prove useful in plac- ing the instant requests in their proper perspective. The pleadings before us originally arose out of Natick's dis- covery by Fox of a search warrant issued by the Natick District Court on or about August 29, 1966, which authorized the search of a house occupied by a Home Service principal to discover allegedly obscene pictures. In further support of these issues, Natick filed affidavits of two minors (Affiant A and Affiant B), viho were present at the home of Home Serv- ice's principal on August 17, 1966, when these allegedly obscene pictures were shown. This action prompted Home Serv- ice to obtain affidavits from the same affiants who repudiated their former af- fidavits in certain material respects con- cerning the activities of Home Service's principal and the role of Fox in obtain- ing the former affidavits.' Since these later affidavits formed the basis for Home Service's request for a character issue as to Fox and Natick (concerning the man- ner in which the initial affidavits were obtained), the Board has combined this request with Natick's motion to enlarge issues so as to facilitate the disposition of these interrelated matters. However, these matters are further complicated by still another set of affidavits, fied by Fox and Paul G. Murphy,1\" to explain the manner in which they obtained the first set of affidavits and to support Natick's initial request as well as Natick's opposi- tion to Home Service's requested issue. In order to disentangle the facts before us, the Board will first discuss the search warrant\" aspect of this proceeding and then present a detailed analysis of the series of seven affidavits that form the basis of the requested issues. 6. As noted previously, Natick's firstrequested character issue against Home 0 Home Service had previously filed an af-fidavit of its principal in opposition to Natick's request. IO lurphy is an attorney who works as a law associate out of Fox's office. Murphy waspresent during the taking of the initial af- fidavits, presumably for the purpose of nota-rizing the affidavits. n Fox also filed an affidavit explaining thecircumstances under which he discovered the search warrant and affidavit in support thereof, but this affidavit (attached to Na- tick's original request), should not be con-fused with Fox's later affidavit concerning the circumstances surrounding the taking of the affidavits of Affiant A and Affiant B. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1970 NOTICES Service specified in its motion to enlarge was subsequently revised and expanded in a supplementary pleading, filed De- cember 3, 1969. As originally specified, that issue would inquire into the facts and circumstances surrounding the is- suance of the search warrant on Au- gust 29, 1966, to search the premises of Home Service's principal and the effect of the evidence so adduced upon Home Service's requisite qualifications. Based on an affidavit of Leon M. Fox and copies of the search warrant and supporting af- fidavit, Natick points out that the search warrant authorized a search of the prin- cipal's premises for allegedly obscene pic- tures; that the affidavit In support of the warrant indicates that, as the result of a prior investigation, Massachusetts police authorities learned that one Sid- ney Shulman 1 and several young boys had visited the home of the Home Service principal on August 17, 1966; and that said principal had served beer and had shown allegedly- obscene pictures during the course of the visit. Fox, in his affi- davit, claims that the local authorities have documentation and other evidence in support of the warrant's affidavit, but that these police files can only be pro- duced pursuant to a valid subpoena.? Ac- cording to Fox, the same local author- ities informed him that at least one of the boys involved in the incident was under 16 and that a number of others were under 18. Natick asserts that the acts reported to have been committed by the principal, i.e., serving beer to minors and showing obscene pictures to minors,- \"if in fact committed, presumably vio- lated several statutes of the Common- wealth of Massachusetts.\" These Charges, according to Natick, raise serious ques- tions concerning the basic qualifications of Home Service which should be inves- tigated by the Commission. The peti- tioner also notes that the fact that the search warrant was returned with the notation \"[niothing obscence found\" is not conclusive, especially since there is documentation supporting the charges made in the warrant's affidavit in Massa- chusetts police files and since the con- duct underlying the charges can be considered by the Commission in passing upon the principal's and ultimately the applicant's qualifications. 7. In opposition to Natick's original request, Home Service asserts that Na- tick's accusation is baseless since the l2Shulman is not a party to the Home Service application. Fox, in his affidavit, ex- plains that Shulman fled the Massachusetts jurisdiction after having been apprehended and released on bail pursuant to indictments returned against him in the Worcester County Superior Court of Worcester, Mass.\" On Dec. 2, 1969, Natick requested the Examiner to issue a subpoena duces tecum to Sergeant Fahey, Chief of the Headquarters Squad of the city of Worcester, Mass., Police Department, to compel production of docu- ments which allegedly support the affidavit filed for the issuance of the search warrant. This motion was denied by the Examiner, FCC 691M-1684, released Dec. 19, 1969.search warrant1' was returned with nothing fodnd and since its principal was not charged with any unlawful conduct of any kind as a result of the search. Home Service contends that the pre- sumption of innocence has not been re- butted since there has been no complaint, no prosecution, and no other claimhed violations of law by this principal or any other principal of Home Service. In further opposition, Home Service submits a November 4, 1969, affidavit of the prin- cipal involved concerning the date in question, who states, inter alia, that: (1) His home was searched, and nothing obscene was ,found; (2) Shulman came to his house with six or seven other per- sons; (3) he (the principal) had not previously known these other persons; (4) he told Shulman that he had no 'beer, whereupon Shulman went out of the house and brought some back; (5) he did not know that any of the boys were minors; and (6) no obscene pictures were shown. The Broadcast Bureau, in its comments, points out that the local au- thorities, with all of the facts before them, have done nothing to indicate that they believe that Home Service's prin- cipal did, in fact, commit a crime. Since the local authorities would have acted if the circumstances warranted such ac- tion,- the Bureau is of the opinion that Natick has failed to make a persuasive showing. 8. Natick's reply contains the Novem- ber 28, 1969, affidavit of its communica- tions counsel, in which he states that he was attaching a copy of a \"handwritten\" affidavit of Affiant A, dated November 21, 1969. Affiant A, one of the minors al- legedly present at the home of Home Service's principal during the night in question, states, in his affidavit, inter alia: (1) That the boys knew the prin- cipal by another name; (2) that he and two other boys had previously met the principal at Shulman's house in early August; (3) that the principal and Shulman told them at this meeting that they would afrange a party in about a week or so at the principal's home; (4) that, after arriving at the principal's home on August 17, 1966, Shulman went out and brought back beer and that the principal stated he had beer in the house; (5) that Shulman and the principal \"broke out some movie films\" and the latter put them in his projector and showed them; (6) that the films were \"stag movies\" of nude muscular men walking through the woods; (7) that, at the time, he was 16, and the other boys were 17, 18, and 19 years old; (8) that he gave a statement a few days later to the Worcester Police Department con- cerning what took place at the principal's house; (9) that the principal sat in a chair, drank beer and showed the \", Home Service also argues that the search warrant was defective under applicable law and that the warrant would have been sup- pressed had an appropriate motion been made, since it did not contain an adequate description of the objects to be seized.movies; (10) that the principal said he knew some of the people in the movies and said he was. \"queer\" and he did not want his next door neighbor to see the movies. After noting several inconsisten- cies between the affidavits of Home Service's principal and Afilant A, which, it is contended, must be explored at hear- ing, Natick concludes that Afflant A's affidavit alone furnishes sufficient sup- port of the search warrant affidavit to necessitate enlargement of the Issues. 9. Natick's supplement to its motion to enlarge issues contains the December 3, 1969, affidavit of its communications counsel, in which he states that he was attaching a copy of a \"handwritten\" affidavit of Afflant B, dated November 28, 1969. Affiant B, another of the minors allegedly present at the principal's house during the night in question, states, In his affidavit, inter alia: (1) That he and three other boys had previously met the principal at Shulman's house In July of 1966; (2) that the principal brought beer out from his refrigerator during tlhe visit of August, 1966; (3) that the principal brought out the films at Shulman's re- quest, set up the projector and screen, and showed the films; (4) that the mov- ies were of \"male nude sex orgies\" In- volving certain sodomous acts; (5) that the principal, as did Shulman, moved among the boys and tried to entice them into the bedroom; and (6) that the prin- cipal said he was \"queer and gay\" and wanted to go to bed with the boys. Natick again points to certain inconsistencies between the affidavits of Home Service's principal and Afflant B which allegedly require further inquiry. In light of Afll- ant B's statements concerning the prin- cipal's actions during the evening of Au- gust 17, 1966, Natick suggests a revision and expansion of the issue requested previously in order to embrace all of the events which allegedly occurred at the principal's home on August 17, 1966. See paragraph 1, supra. 10. Subsequent to Natick's submission of the affidavits of Afflants A and B, Home Service allegedly interviewed the same two affiants. The affidavits obtained from these individuals by Home Service were filed as a supplement to its opposi- tion to Natick's motion to enlarge and as support for Its requested character issue against Fox and Natick. It is Home Service's Contention that these affidavits disclose the manner in which the Natick affidavits were obtained and presented to the Commission, and .which \"Indicates a shocking lack of candor and truth\" and an attempt by Natick to misrepre- sent to the Commission the factual basis for its motion to enlarge issues. In sup- port of these allegations, Home Service relies on copies of \"handwritten\" affi- davits of Affiants A and B, dated Decem- ber 21, 1969, and December 31, 1969, re- respectively. Affiant A, when interviewed by Home Service, stated inter alla: (1) That Fox told him they could talk in the car if he didn't want his parents In- volved; (2) that Fox wrote down what he said; (3) that he thought Fox and FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1970 NOTICES Murphy were lawyers representing Home Service's principal; (4) that he told Fox that Shulman went out to his (Shul- man's) car to get the movies; (5) that Shulman threaded the projector and that Affiant A did not know where the pro- jector came from (at this point, Afflant A relates that Fox got mad and said \"We are not interested in Shulman, we are interested in [Home Service's princi- pall.\"); (6) that he could not remember the principal doing anything wrong (at this point, he stated, Fox hollered at him); (7) that Fox more or less told him what happened during the night at the principal's home; (3) that he told Fox that he did not recall any acts of sodomy in the films--because if there were any he would have remembered; (9) that Fox was rude and he let Fox put down what he wanted, and when he told Fox the information was not true, Fox would start arguing with him; (10) that he told Fox all the principal did was sit in a chair and be quiet; (11) that the principal had beer which Afflant A got himself (although Fox kept insisting that the principal served the beer); (12) that the principal did not touch any of the boys present; (13) that the movies were \"muscle type films\" not \"sex films\"; (14) that when he told Fox some parts of the statement were not true, Fox said: \"Roughly that is what happened,\" and Afflant A responded, \"yes\"; and (15) that the principal did not make any improper suggestions or advances to anyone at the party. 11. Afflant B, when interviewed by Home Service, stated, inter alia: (1) That on four occasions during his inter- view with Fox, Fox stated that the \"least he [Affiant B] could get out of this would be an all expense paid trip to Washington for two or three days\"; (2) that Fox said he was representing a group opposing the principal for a radio station; (3) that Fox told him that he had a complete statement from Affiant A and that Fox knew all about what happened that night; (4) that Fox talked to him as if Afflant A \"had just said all the things he was suggesting to me\"; (5) that Fox phrased nearly every ques- tion with the words \"Didn't this happen and didn't that happen?\" (6) that he went along with what Fox said Affiant A had told Fox; (7) that Fox wrote down what he said; and (8) that he signed the statement just to get the interview over with. Home Service, in support of its request for a character issue against Fox and Natick, asserts that Fox had no intention of presenting accurate state- ments to the Commission and that Fox's \"only interest was obtaining self-serving statements to serve his client of which he is a principal, a patent conflict of in- terest of the most pernicious sort.\" In this regard, Home Service avers that the affidavit of Afflant B was merely F6x's statement of what he wanted Affiant B to say and that Fox's statements to Affiant B about what Affiant A told Fox were plainly false. Home Service asserts that Fox has demonstrated a lack of forth- rightness and candor, and that, were he 'practicing before the Commission, hisintentional filing of misleading docu- ments which allegedly misrepresent and distort the facts, would warrant his cen- sure or disbarment by the Commission. Furthermore, Home Service insists that the interrogations of the affiants were conducted in such a manner that only the \"preconceived result\" desired by Fox would be forthcoming; that such action falls short of the standard of conduct required of Commission applicants; and that, accordingly, a disqualifying issue, is required. 12. The Broaacast Bureau, in its com- ments on Home Service's requested issue, notes that the Commission is now con- fronted with four affidavits (two affi- davits by both Affiant A and Affiant B) which have formed the foundation for requests for the addition of character issues in this proceeding and that Affi- ants A and B are now retracting their previous affidavits and accusing Fox, a Natick principal, of preparing and sub- mitting false affidavits to the Commis- sion. The Bureau concludes that, since the \"affidavits raise very serious ques- tions on all sides,\" these matters should be fully explored through the hearing process. 13. In opposition to Home Service's request for a character issue, Natick as- serts that Home Service acted with a \"surprising degree of recklessness\" in making its \"unprecedented personal at- tack\" upon a respected member of the Massachusetts bar on the sole basis of the affidavits obtained by Home Service from Affiants A and B. In defense of Fox, Naticksubmits Fox's personal state- ment of all of his civic, religious, char- itable, literary, legal, business, scholastic and governmental accomplishments from the time he was admitted to the bar in 1951 to the present.n In addition, Natick attaches affidavits of Fox and Murphy, which describe the manner in which the initial affidavits of Affiants A and B were taken. Fox, in his affidavit of January 10, 1970, first describes the manner in which the affidavit of Afflant A was obtained stating inter alia, that: (1) The Decem- ber 21, 1969, statement of Afflant A taken by Home Service is almost completely false; (2) Affiant A preferred talking in the car so his mother could not see them; (3) he (Fox) told Affiant A of his interest in the matter and that he was being ques- tioned as a disinterested eyewitness to the event; (4) he told Afflant A that he was only interested in Home Service's principal; (5) Affiant A sat in the right- front seat next to the curb and was free to leave at any time; (6) Affiant A at no time appeared nervous or tense; 1 (7) \"1This statement has been admitted into evidence as Exhibit 30 by the Hearing Ex- aminer, except as to the material pertaining to mr. Fox's wife. 10 Fox also states that he thought \"that anyone who met [Afflant A] would quickly conclude that he is not likely to .be fright- ened, tense or nervous at a layman question- ing him on any type of level, and does not appear to be the type that would likely to be [sic]. intimidated even by a law enforce- ment official.\"10173 Whatever Affiant A said, he wrote down exactly in the speaker's words; (8) he read the statement over lin6 by line to Affant A, asked if it was all the truth, and that Affiant A responded \"yes\"; (9) he did not holler, shout, or intimidate Affiant A, nor was he rude to him; and (10) he only questioned him in a direct examination form. With regard to the affidavit of Afflant B, Fox states, inter alia, that: (1) Afflant B elected to be in- terviewed in the car; (2) Fox explained his interest in Natick and that he was a principal; (3) he told Afflant B that the very \"worst\" that could happen to him would be that he would be sub- poenaed to go to Washington to testify and would receive a witness fee and travel expenses as allowed by law; (4) he told Afflant B that he had spoken to Afflant A, but did not discuss with Affiant B any of the contents of the statement he had already obtained from Affiant A; (5) he wrote down exactly what Affiant B told him; (6) he questioned Affiant B in the direct examination form; and (7) he went over the statement line by line with Affiant B, who indicated the statement was all true. 14. Murphy, in his affidavit of Janu- ary 10, 1970, first describes, as did Fox, the manner in which the affidavit of Affiant A was obtained stating, inter alia, that: (1) He went along with Fox to serve as a disinterested witness andas a notary public; (2) the January 5, 1970, affidavit of Affiant A contained many \"untrue\" statements; (3) Fox made it very clear that he was not the attorney for Home Service's principal; (4) Affiant A, on November 21, 1969, had said that Shul- man and the principal \"broke\" out some films in direct contradiction of his state- ment of January 5, 1970, wherein Affiant A stated that Shulman went out to his car to get the films; (5) Fox never hol- lered at Affiant A, nor was he rude, threatening or argumentative; (6) Fox asked no leading questions; and (7) Fox at no time told Affiant A what had hap- pened at the party. With regard to the interview with Affiant B, Murphy's affi- davit further states, inter alia, that: (1) Fox did not put words in Affiant B's mouth, but merely tried to clarify what Affiant B related when Afflant B made statements that were inconsistent with his prior statements; (2) Affiant B's statement of December 31, 1969, contains several \"distortions\"; (3) Fox did not tell Afflant B that he had a complete state- ment from Affiant A; (4) Fox used a direct examination technique in this interview; and (5) at no time was Afflant B the least bit nervous, frightened, or embarrassed. 15. It is Natick's contention that the affidavits of Fox and Murphy clearly establish that: (1) Both Affiant A and Affiant B will- ingly granted interviews to Mr. Fox. (2) During each of the interviews the interviewee was in the right-front seat of Mr. Fox's car and was free and able at any time to leave the car; (3) Both interviewees volunteered in- formation not previously known to Mr. Fox or Natick; FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1970 NOTICES (4) Mr. Fox did not put words into the interviewees' mouths, and the interviews were conducted in a proper manner; and (5) Both interviewees specifically stated on a line by line basis, that their statements were true before they exe- cuted their respective affidavits. For these reasons, Natick concludes that there are no substantial and material questions of fact raised which require a hearing on the issue requested by Home Service. 16. In reply, Home 3ervice urges that, if Fox's biographical statement is rele- vant to the Review Board's considera- tion of Home Service's motion to en- large, then the absence of any adverse allegations concerning the life of its prin cipal is similarly relevant to Natick's motion to enlarge issues. With regard to the Fox and Murphy affidavits, Home Service submits that these affidavits establish clear factual disputes with the affidavits of Affiant A and Affiant B ob-tained by Home Service, and that these differences can only be resolved by evi- dentiary hearing. In addition, Home Service avers that the issue of Fox's qualifications cannot be decided on the basis of affidavits since credibility is now in issue, particularly in respect to the affidavit of Fox7 Furthermore, Home Service argues that Natick cannot have it both ways-that if the Review Board finds that the affidavits given to Home Service by Affiants A and B cannot be credited, then the Review Board may not give credence to the initial affidavits from the same individuals obtained by Natick. If anything, Home Service avers that the affidavits given to Home Service by Afflants A and B must be accepted and those given to Natick must be rejected since both affiants effectively'renounced their initial affidavits given to Natick. In reply to Natick's characterization of its pleading, Home Service asserts that there has been no \"personal attack\" against Fox which would not have been made in the same premises on any other prin- cipal of Natick, lawyer or layman; andthat the \"recklessness\" is not that of Home Service but of Natick which filed an \"unprecedented personal attack\" on one of its principals. 17. Preliminarily, the Board will ad- dress itself to the character issues that have been raised by Natick in connection with the allegedly improper activities of Home Service's principal and the is- suance of the August 29, 1966, search warrant. We realize that persons holding substantial Interests in- broadcast com- panies must be keenly aware of and re- sponsive to rules and regulations of State and Federal jurisdictions as well as ob- servant of those of the Commission. However, the fact that a search warrant had been issued in 196.6 for the discovery of allegedly obscene materials at the premises of a Home Service principal 27Home Service further alleges that, inso- far as the Fox and Murphy affidavits are di-rected to the states of mindof Affant A and Affiant B, they are not affidavits of personswith personal knowledge and cannot b6 con-sidered as proper rebuttal of afflants' second affidavits.cannot be considered adversely against him, nor affect the comparative con- sideration of the corporate applicant, especially when the warrant was returned without the discovery of the allegedma- terials. The Commission has held that criminal prosecution of an applicant which results in acquittal cannot be con- sidered adversely to the applicant nor affect his qualifications to be a licensee. See James A. Noe (WNOE), 13 FCC 799, 4 RR 1441 ,(1949). In the instant case, the local Massachusetts authorities, with all the relevant facts before them, have done nothing to indicate that Home Service's principal has committed a crime. Since no complaint, indictment, or other action has been brought against the individual, the Board is not convinced that the pre- sumption of innocence that attaches to such an individual has been rebutted. Moreover, we note that the Commission has traditionally declined to interfere in matters of alleged violations of State law where the State officials, themselves, have apparelitly deemed the allegations to be nonmeritorious. Cf. Home Service Broad- casting Corp., 21 FCC 2d 168, 18 RR 2d 63 (1970) ; North American Broadcasting Co., Inc., 15 FCC 2d 979, 15 RR 2d 311 (1969). The question, if one exists, as to whether or not there have been violations of State law is initially one for the Com- monwealth of Massachusetts, and is not properly the subject of a determination in this proceeding. 18. Although the Board has decided to deny Natick's request for character issues going to the allegedly improper activities of Home Service's principal (paragraph 17, supra), we are of the opinion that serious questions of possible misrepresentation are clearly raised by virtue of the affidavits submitted by the competing applicants. The affidavit of its principal, submitted by Home Service -in support of its opposition to Natick's requested character issues, contains many matters that are clearly incon- sistent with certain alleged facts that have remained constant in-the affidavits of Affiants A and B. In the affidavit of November 4, 1969, Home Service's prin- cipal states that he did not previously know any of the minors I present at. his home during the night in question, whereas both Affiants A and B contend in their affidavits of November 21, 1969,and November 28,; 1969, respectively, that they had been introduced to him by Shulman at Shulman's house a week or so earlier' The principal also avers that he had no beer in the house that night, whereas Affiant A claims, in his first affidavit, that the principal offered beer to the visitors, and, in his second affidavit that Affiant A himself went out and got the beer (from the kitchen); Affiant B, in his first affidavit, avers that 18 The principal also contends that he didnot know that any of the boys present wereminors, whereas Affiant A stated he was 16 years old at that time and the other boyspresent were 17, 18, and 19. See paragraph 8, supra.109 This matter was not repudiated by either Afflant A or 3B in. their subsequent affidavits.the principal brought out beer for them.-O The Home Service principal further relates that no obscene pictures were shown during the evening, whereas Affiant A states, in both of his affidavits,that the movies were of nude muscular men walking through the woods, and Affiant B alleges, in his first affidavit,that the films depicted male sex orgies.2\" The conflict of the afflants here Is plain and concise. Therefore, due to these Ir- reconcilable factual inconsistencies, the Board is constrained to specify a mis-representation issue against Home Serv- ice and its principal. As we noted in Five Cities Broadcasting Co., Inc., FCC 62R--153, 24 RR 743, where, as here, we have affidavits, each contradictory of the other, the only appropriate resolution of the conflicts is on the record In hear- ing. An appropriate issue will be specified. 19. In support of its motion to enlarge, Home Service contends that a character issue is warranted due to the manner In which Fox obtained the affidavits of Affiants A and B. For this reason, Home Service submitted the later affidavits of saii affiants, dated December 21, 1969, and December 31, 1969, respectively, describing the manner in which their first set of affidavits was taken by Fox. These affidavits also apparently repudi- ate the affiants' earlier affidavits given to Fox. In opposition, Natick filed the affidavits of Fox and Murphy In order to give their view of how the affidavits were obtained. Affiant A, in his affidavit taken by Home Service, states, that he got the impression that Fox rezresented Home Service's principal, since Fox was only interested in what the principal had done wrong, whereas Fox and Murphy relate in their respective affidavits that Fox specifically apprised both affiants of his interest in the matter. Affiant A states that Fox on a few occasions got angry, hollered and was generally rude to him, whereas Fox and Murphy statethat Fox did ndt holler, shout or other- wise intimidate either of the affiants. Both affiants A and B allege that Fox more or less told them what had hap- pened and that he asked leading questions, whereas Fox and Murphy claim that Fox only wrote down what the affiants told him and that he only questioned the affiants by the direct examination technique. Affiant A also states that he told Fox at the end ofthe interview that not all of the infor- mation in the statement was true, andthat Fox remarked that it was \"roughly\"what happened. However, Fox and Murphy allege in their affidavits that,in each instance, Fox read the statement back to the particular affiant on a line by line basis and that each swore that it was completely true. Affiant B con- tends, in his affidavit, that, on four separate occasions, Fox remarked that \"the least he could get out of this would =0 There was no mention of the principal's offering or serving beer In Affiant B's second affidavit. =Affiant B did not discuss the subject matter of the movies in his second affidavit. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 197010174 NOTICES be an all expense paid trip to Washing-ton for two or three days,\" whereas F03 and Murphy affirm that Fox stated thathat was the \"worst\" that could happen Affiant B also states that he informec Fox that he had forgotten most of what went on that night and that Fox stateche had a complete statement from Affani A and that Fox knew all about what happened. In response, Fox replies thathe did not discuss with Affant B any ol the contents of Affant A's statement,and Murphy supports this statement. Affiant B also states that he merely went along with what Fox said occurred on the night in question. Fox states that Affant A's affidavit of December 21, 1969, is \"almost completely false,\" and Murphy claims that it contained many untrue statements. Murphy describes Afflant B's December 31, 1969, affidavit as containing \"several distortions' 20. Based on these later affidavits of Affants A and B, Home Service contendsthat Fox had no intention of presenting to the Commission factually accurate statements, and that he intentionally filed misleading documents and misrep- resentations with the Commission. The Review Board, on the basis of the plead- ings before it, is of the belief that the allegations are sufficient to raise a sub- stantial question as to whether Fox did,in fact, wrongfully influence the affliants, and therefore to warrant the addition of an issue to permit the parties to adduce the requisite record in hearing to deter- mine what actually occurred. The affl- davits of Fox and Murphy clearly con- flict with those of Afflants A and B in many material respects. This alone would ordinarily dictate the addition of the requested issue. However, in addition to the conflicts, there is raised, by the affidavits of Afflants A and B, a strong inference that Fox may have wrongfully or unduly influenced the afflants or otherwise misrepresented their state- ments. Furthermore, the Board notes that the affidavits of said affiants (ob-tained by Natick) are remarkably sim- ilar in phraseology, and that, as indicatedin Fox's affidavit, they are definitely notthe \"handwritten\" affidavits of the affi- ants as represented by Natick's commu- nications counsel. These discrepancies, coupled with the conflicting affidavits, raise serious questions which require the addition of an appropriate issue against Fox and thus Natick, so that the matter may be appropriately resolved in an evidentiary proceeding. Lack of candor issue. 21. Natick con- tends that an issue is required to resolve the discrepancy between the Home Serv- ice application, which proposes a large quantity of local live programing, and statements of a Home Service principalreported in a newspaper article to the effect that Home Service's station will use automated programing. Natick claims that it is extremely doubtful that Home Service could use automated pro- =Home Services communications counselalso represented that the afdavits obtainedfrom Afflants A and B were \"handwritten\"by said afflants when apparently they werenot.-graming in view of the amount and fre- quency of the local live programing pro- posed by Home Service. Natick assert, * that, since Home Service never informed I the. Commission of its intention to use automated programing, the public inter- est requires full inquiry into whethel Home Service has -acted with candor in its representations to the Commission. Home Service, in opposition, charges that Natick's request is based on a \"complete misconception\" of what automated equipment entails. Home Service points out that the possession of automated equipment by a station does not neces- sarily result in 100 percent automated programing, and that, in fact, live broad- casts on automated stations are com- monplace. In conclusion, Home Service contends that this new equipment would free station personnel from routine oper- ations to devote more time to the prepa- ration of live programing arid to the gathering and editing of news, all of which can readily be broadcast between automated segments. The Broadcast Bureau is of the opinion that automated programing is in no way inconsistent with Home Service's programing repre- sentations and that there is no basis for adding the requested issue. 22. The Review Board is in accord with the views espoused by Home Service and the Bureau. The issue requested by Natick is not warranted. The request is clearly deficient; it cites no figures to demonstrate the amount of time that Home Service proposes to devote to live broadcasts, and it fails to assess the spe- cific impact upon Home Service's pro- gram proposal that would result from the utilization of automated equipment; in other words, it lacks any specifi*c allegations of fact. In our view, live broadcasting does not, as a matter of course, cease with the acquisition of automated equipment by a station. In- deed, there is virtually no distinction between live broadcasts and programs taped on the premises of a local station for later broadcast. Moreover, the use of taped programs can be successfully inte- grated with live programs so as not to affect the character of the program ma- terial. Since the two methods of broad- casting are not necessarily mutually ex- clusive, the issue will not be specified. Construction issue. 23. On July 6, 1967, the Commission announced the grant without hearing of the Home Service application. However, upon Natick's ap- peal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the case was remanded to the Commission for its further consideration. Natick Broadcast Associates, Inc. v. FCC, 128 U.S. App. D.C. 203, 385 F.2d 985, 11 RR 2d 2065 (1967). Subsequently, by order, dated December 6, 1967, the Commission stayed the construction permit previously granted Home Service pending further proceedings before the Commission. Now, Natick claims that Home Service con- tinued construction of its facility after December 6, 1967, by painting the trim on its transmitter shack and by the in- stallation of a \"protective\" fence around the base of the tower. In spite of the fact that Home Service was notified of theCourt's decision by Natick via telegram, dated November 7, 1967, Natick contends, Home Service did not cease construction, and blatantly disregarded the Commis- sion's order by continuing construction beyond December 6, 1967. Natick alleges that such conduct calls into question the L basic character qualifications of Home Service and requires the addition of an appropriate issue. * 24. Home Service, in its opposition, asserts that Natick's request is clearly frivolous since constructing a safety * fence and painting the trim on a build- ing do not amount to construction under any test, but merely involve the mainte- nance of an existing structure.= The Bureau, in opposing the issue, claims that Home Service did not act improp- erly in continuing construction until or- dered to cease by the Commission. The fact that Natick requested Home Service to cease construction is not controlling in the Bureau's view since the governing date is the date the Commission ordered construction to cease. The Bureau recog- nizes that the stay order must be read with a modicum of reasonableness, and contends that, if a dangerous condition exists at the construction site, the per- mittee can take such measures as are necessary to protect itself and the public from the potentially dangerous condi- tion, Therefore, the Bureau concludes that there is clearly no violation of the Commission's stay order and that these actions of Home Service were clearly not\"construction of broadcast facilities.\" 25. The Review Board agrees with Home Service and the Broadcast Bureau that the requested issue is not war- ranted. The erection of a protective fence around a transmitter tower and the painting of the trim on a transmitter shack amount to no more than protec- tive maintenance of the existing struc- ture; in no sense can such actions be deemed further construction of buildings or facilities necessary for the operation of a broadcast station. Indeed, a permit- tee would be remiss in its obligation to the public as well as to the Commission if it were to leave its construction site in an inherently precarious state. Since Home Service was under a continuing obligation to construct its facility until notified by the Commission to cease such construction and since Home Service's actions thereafter did not constitute violations of the stay order or amount to further construction of the Home Service facility, the requested issue will not be specified.Rate card issue. 26. Natick contends that Home Service's proposed rate card for Station WGTR violates Commission rules in two respects; first, Natick al- leges the portrayal of the 0.1 mv./m. con- tour on the face of the card is \"grossly misleading\" to advertisers, who might be led to believe that their messages wi reach listeners farther away than will actually be the case; and second, it urges 23ome Service also points out that at the time the stay was issued, it informed the Commission that it was constructing a fence around its tower for safety and that it would engage in no other construction. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 197010175 10176 that the representation in the rate card that the station is on \"Clear. Channel 1060AM\" is deceptive since the Home Service facility is a Class II station, not a Class I \"Clear Channel station.\" In olpbsition to the requested issue, Home Service attacks Natick's allegations as being \"naive in the extreme:\" In this regard, Home Service 'points out that Natick does not allege that the WGTR contours are incorrectly depicted on the rate card, and cites no authority that dis- tinctions must be made between Class I and Class ]1 stations on rate cards. Home Service emphasizes that it specifically labels its 0.1 mv./m. contour as \"inter- mittent\" and that there can be no dispute that 1060 kc. is a \"Clear Channel\" fre- quency under \u00a7 of the Com- mission's rules.' That the 0.1 mv./m. con- tour is referred to as intermittent, Home Service claims, recognizes the fact that the intermittent service area may be limited or destroyed by interference. Therefore, Home Service asserts, there ale no misrepresentations on the face of its rate card, and no issue should be added. The Broadcast Bureau agrees with Home Service that there is nothing deceptive about the rate card and that Home Service has made full disclosure to anyone who reads it. 27. The Review Board shares the views of Home Service and the Broadcast Bu- reau that the requested issue should' be denied. Rule 73.25(b) designates the frequency of 1060 kc/s. as a clear chan- nel, assigned for use by both a Class I and a Class II station; therefore, Home Service's representation in this regard is correct. Section 73.11(c) of the Commis- sion's rules defines intermittent service area as the \"area receiving service from the groundwave but beyond the primary service area and subject to some interfer- ence and fading.\" Thus, Home Service, by labeling its 0.1 mv/m contour as in- termittent, makes an express representa- tion that service which it may provide between this contour and its normally protected 0.5 mv/m contour may be materially limited or destroyed due to interference from other stations or fad- ing. Thus, we do not believe that pros- pective advertisers would be misled by the rate card. For these reasons, the re- quested issue is not warranted. Letter request of May 1, 1970. 28. As a final matter, we note that Natick and Home Service filed a letter request on May 1, 1970, for our consideration. In the letter, the parties disclose that they are presently engaged in settlement discus- sions which could simplify this proceed- ing and expedite the inauguration of a broadcast service to Natick. They, there- fore, request that the Board withhold further action on the motions to enlarge issues already referenced in paragraph 1, supra, and on a further motion to en- :4Rule 73.25 reads in pertinent part: The frequencies in the following tabula- tions are designated as clear channels and assigned for use by the classes of stations given: (b) Tro each of the following channelsthere may be assigned Class I and Class II stations: * * * 1060 * * * kc./s.NOTICES large issues, filed on March 12, 1970, by Natick, for a period of 30 days to \"en- able the parties to determine whether a settlement can be worked out and, if so, to prepare and make an appropriate fil- ing with the Board.\" The Broadcast Bu- reau, by letter, dated and filed May 4, 1970, opposes the request on the ground that any settlement agreement pursuant to \u00a7 1.525 of the rules could not be con- sidered by the Board until outstanding motions to enlarge seeking character qualifications issues are considered and issues, if added to the proceeding, are re- solved. The Board, of course, agrees with the Bureau's position. Any request for approval of a settlement agreement which the parties may subsequently file cannot be considered until the outstand- ing motions to enlarge issues which re- quest character issues are disposed of and such issuesif specified by the Board, ate resolved. With our action here, we note that several character qualifications issues are outstanding against the appli-cants and that the resolution of these matters must precede the approval of the reimbursement aspect of any settlement agreement. Moreover, we do not look with favor upon the parties' use of the informal technique of a letter request; a formal request consistent with appli- cable procedures is to be preferred. For these reasons, the request for a delay in our consideration of pending motions to enlarge in this proceeding will be denied. 29. Accordingly, it is ordered, That the motion for leave to file supplement to Natick's supplementary motion to en- large issues, filed December 3, 1969, by Natick Broadcast Associates, Inc.; the motion for leave to file supplemental op- position, filed January 7, 1970, by Home Service Broadcasting Corp.; and the mo- tion for leave to file reply to supple-mental opposition, filed January 16, 1970, by Natick Broadcast Associates, Inc., are granted, and the pleadings att ched thereto are accepted; and 30. It is further ordered, That the sup- plementary motion to enlarge issues, filed October 10, 1969, by Natick Broad-cast Associates, Inc., is granted to the extent herein indicated, and is denied in all other respects, and that the issues inthis proceeding are enlarged to include the following issue: (a) To determine the facts and cir- cumstances surrounding the filing of a principal's affidavit, dated November 4, 1969, with the Commission by Home Service Broadcasting Corp., and to de- termine, in light of the evidence adduced pursuant to this issue, whether Home Service Broadcasting Corp. or its prin- cipal has made misrepresentations to the Commission or has, in any manner, at- tempted to deceive or mislead the Com- mission, and, if so, to determine the effect of such conduct on the applicant's basic and/or comparative qualifications to be a Commission licensee. 31. It is further ordered, That the further motion to enlarge issues, filed January 9, 1970, by Home Service Broad- casting Corp., is granted to the extent herein indicated, and is denied in all other respects; and that the issues in this proceeding are enlarged to include the following issue:(b) To determine the facts and cir- cumstances surrounding the preparation and execution of affidavits by certain minors, dated November 21, 1969, and November 28, 1969, respectively, and filed with the Commission by Natick Broad- cast Associates, Inc., and to determine, in light of the evidence adduced pur- suant to this issue, whether Natick Broadcast Associates, Inc., or Its prin- cipal has made misrepresentations to the Commission or has, In any manner, at- tempted to deceive or mislead the Com- mission, and, if so, to determine the ef- fect of such conduct on the applicant's basic and/or comparative qualifications to be a Commission licensee. 32.

FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1970 NOTICES misrepresentation, \u00a7 1.65 and availability of funds issues against Voice of Reason.2 2. In its petition, the Bureau alleges sufficient facts, adequately supported, to warrant the addition of the requested issues. As to the first requested issue, the Bureau avers that Voice of Reason mis- represented on its February 28, 1969, balance sheet that it owned, without en- cumbrance, a Youth Ranch in Missouri, when in fact the applicant had sub- stantially encumbered this property in July 1968. The Youth Ranch, alleges theBureau, was deeded as security for a $60,430.59 loan which has yet to be re- paid, and Voice of Reason has recently been sued for $58,423.15, the outstanding balance on the loan. Failure to inform the Commission of this substantial and significant change in its financial status, i.e., the pending civil action, is the basisfor the Bureau's requested \u00a7 1.65 issue. Petitioner then questions Voice of Rea- son's financial ability to meet its con-struction and first year operating costs; while acknowledging the applicant's as- surance that it would sell or encumberany of its assets to meet its costs, the Bureau believes, especially in light of the alleged default on the loan secured bythe Missouri Youth Ranch, that Voice of Reason's balance sheet does not demonstrate that it will be able to raise the necessary funds. The Bureau points out that Voice of Reason, in its applica- tion, estimates that first year operating costs and the purchase of necessary equipment will require funds in an amount of approximately $113,000; ini- tially, Voice of Reason showed only $40,000 in liquid assets, but, the Bureaunotes, the applicant was found finan- cially qualified because of its large net worth. However, the Bureau asserts, the inability to rely on the full value of theYouth Ranch results in a substantial de- crease in that net worth: Voice of Rea- son's equity in its fixed assets totals $97,000.2 Thus, if full credit is assigned to all nonliquid assets and all assets were encumbered, Voice of Reason shows an excess of only $24,000 to meet estimated costs and unexpected expenses; this, maintains petitioner, coupled with the applicant's default on anothei loan, is sufficient to warrant an evidentiary hear- ing on the applicant's financial qualifi-cations. The Bureau's allegations are, in our opinion, adequate to raise a substan-tial question as to whether Voice of Reason has available sufficient funds tomeet its estimated costs, as well as whether the applicant misrepresentedfacts to the Commission and complied with the requirements of section 1.65 ofthe rules. Appropriate issues will there- fore be specified. 3. Accordingly, it is ordered, That the petition to enlarge issues, filed May 1, 1970, by the Broadcast Bureau is granted; and4. It is further ordered, That the issues in this proceeding are enlarged by the addition of the following issues: 2 No opposition to the instant petition has been filed and the time for filing has expiredIThis Includes $40,000 of the remaining value of the Youth Ranch.(a) To determine whether Voice of Reason, Inc., has made misrepresenta- tions to the Commission as regards its assets and liabilities in its balance sheet filed with its application on April 2, 1969. (b) To determine whether sufficient funds are available to Voice of Reason, -Inc., to construct and to operate its pro- posed station for I year without revenue. (c) To determine whether Voice of Reason, Inc., has complied with the pro- visions of \u00a7 1.65 of the Commission's rules by keeping the Commission advised of substantial changes. (d) To determine, in light of the facts adduced pursuant to the foregoing issues, whether Voice of Reason has the requi- site qualifications to be a Commission licensee. 5. It is further ordered, That the bur- den of proceeding with the evidence on issues (a) and (c) above shall be on the Broadcast Bureau, the burden of pro- ceeding with the introduction of evi- dence on issue (b) above shall be on Voice of Reason, Inc., and the burden of proof under all of the issues added herein shall be on Voice of Reason, Inc.

The buyer, El Paso Natural Gas Co. (El Paso), in ac- cordance with its policy of protesting tax filings proposing reimbursement for the New Mexico Emergency School Tax in excess of 0.55 percent, is expected to file a protest to these rate increases. El Paso questions the right of the producer under the tax reim- bursement clause to file a rate increease re- flecting tax reimbursement computed on the basis of an increase in tax rate by the New Mexico legislature in excess of 0.55 percent. While El Paso concedes that the New Mexico legislature effected a higher rate of at least 0.55 percent, they claim there is controversy as to whether or not the new legislation ef- fected an increased rate in excess of 0.55 percent. In view of the contractual problem presented, the hearings provided for herein for Bernat and Tenneco's rate filings shall concern themselves the contractual basis for such rate filings, as well as the statutory lawfulness of the proposed increased rates and charges.

The proposed rate is 4.6 cents below the 20.6-cent initial ceiling rate for the area Involved. Opinion No. 567 provides that a producer of gas discovered after Septem- ber 28, 1960, would be entitled to collect the 20.6-cent price without suspension. Although the gas was discovered after September 28, 1960, Opinion No. 567 is not applicable since the gas involved Is casinghead gas. Pan American's proposed price increase is sus- pended for 1 day from July 1, 1970, the pro- posed effective date, as stated in the para- graph next above. The proposed rate increases filed by H. N.Burnett (Operator) et al. (Burnett) from 13 cents to 14 cents per Mcf for wellhead sales of gas to Phillips Petroleum Co. (Phil- lips) in Texas Railroad District No. 10. Phil- lips gathers and processes the gas and reselis the gas to interstate pipelines at rates which_are in effect subject to refund. Burnett's pro- posed rates exceed the area increased rate ceiling for Texas Railroad District No. 10. Since the buyer's, Phillips, resale rates are In effect subject to refund we conclude that Burnett's proposed rate increases should be suspended for 1 day from July 1, 1970, the proposed effective date.

GORDON M. GRANT; Secretary. [P.R. Doe. 70-7787; [Docket No. AR70-1] PERMIAN BASIN AREA Order Instituting Area Rate Proceeding JUNE 17, 1970. The original Permian Basin Area Rate Proceeding, Docket No. AR61-1, was in-stituted on December 23, 1960, and rep:. resented the Commission's first step to- ward establishing producer rates on anarea basis following Statement of Gen- eral Policy 61-1, as amended. Prior tothat time, producer regulation had been attempted on an individual com-pany basis. After lengthy hearings,the Commission on August 5 and October 4, 1965, issued Opinions Nos. 468- and 468-A respectively (34 FPC 159, 34 FPC 1068), establishing just and reasonable rates for jurisdictional gas sales in the Permian Basin. These orders were amfirmed in their entirety by the Supreme Court on May 1, 1968. Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747.Data available to the Commission in- dicates that interstate pipelines are un- able to procure contracts for new supplies of gas, on a spot or long-term basis, at the same relative rate as heretofore, and that this does not appear to represent any decline in the productivity of the area below earlier estimates. Recently significant pipeline capacity for intra- - state transportation and sales has beenput into operation. It is in the public interest to institute a new proceeding to review rates in the Permian Basin. In order to induce pro- ducers to dedicate supplies to the Inter- state market without waiting for the final price determination of these pro- ceedings, contracts dated after the date of this order will have the same price ceilings as contracts entered into after the date of the final order herein. The Commission to the maximum ex- tent feasible will utilize the data which has been ordered in the Southern Louisiana area rate proceeding, Docket ,No. AR69-1. Attention is called to Docket No. R-389, notice of investigation, proposed rulemaking and statement on new appli- cations for certificates for sale of Per- mian Basin Area Natural Gas issued concurrently herewith. (35 P.R. 10152) A prehearing conference for the pur- pose of developing the issues and pro- cedures to be followed in this proceeding will be ordered at a future date. The geographical area of the original Permian proceeding was made up of Texas Railroad Commission Districts 7-C and 8 (now 8 and 8-A), plus Chaves, Eddy, and Lea Counties, New Mexico. The present proceeding will be expanded to include Texas Railroad District 7-B, 17 counties in the northern portion of Texas Railroad District No. 1, and Roose- velt County, N. Mex. These additional areas appear to be similar to the original Permian Basin areas not only from the standpoint of geology, but also on the basis of production practices; contract arrangements, and general operating conditions. The Commission finds: It is necessary and appropriate for purposes of carry-ing out the provisions of the Natural GasAct, particularly, but not in limitation of 1 See order issued Apr. 8, 1970, Jack L.Bryant, Trustee, Dockets Nos. R160-416 and R165-158. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1970 NOTICES the foregoing sections 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 15, and 16 thereof (52 Stat. 822, 823, 824, 825, 826, 828, 829, 830;.56 Stat. proceeding be instituted en- compassing the Permian Basin Area, as hereinafter ordered. The Commission orders: (A) An area rate proceeding is hereby instituted to determine rates for sales of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission in the Permian Basin area. (B) This proceeding shall encompass Texas Railroad Commission Districts 7- B, 7-C, 8, and 8-A; Val Verde, Edwards, Real, Bandera, Kerr, Kendall, Comal, Gillespie, Mason, Llano, Blanco, Hays, Travis, Burnet, Williamson, Milam, and Bell Counties, located in Texas Railroad Commission District 1; and Chaves, Eddy, Lea, and Roosevelt Counties, N. Mex. (C) All jurisdictional pipelines pur- chasing, and all producers having juris- dictional sales, in the areas set forth in paragraph (B) above are listed in Appen- dix A hereto, and are hereby made re- spondents to this proceeding. (D) This proceeding shall apply to all section 4 rate suspension proceedings in- volving gas sales in this hearing area and also to all section 7 certificate proceed- ings involving sales in the hearing area to which the respondents listed in Ap- pendix A are parties, and to all such pro- ceedings arising during the pendency of this proceeding. (E) Evidence filed in Phase I of the Southern Louisiana Area Rate Proceed- ing, Docket No. AR69-1, is hereby in- corporated by reference into this pro- ceeding, and will be considered to the extent deemed relevant to the issues in AR70-1. Respondents or interveners in this proceeding who wish to cross- examine or rebut such evidence should do so in the AR69-1 proceeding or show cause by the date set in paragraph I, in- fra, why such procedure is not appro- priate. (F) The proceeding hereby instituted shall be conducted in two separate phases. Phase I will be confined to evi- dence relating to price ceilings for con- tracts entered into after the date of final order herein, including evidence with respect to the adequacy of gas supply and adequacy of service to consumers, the demand for gas, the cause of a gas shortage, if any, the effect of price on gas supply and demand, and other relevant economic evidence, together with data as to the current nationwide cost of finding and producing nonassociated gas. This phasing will facilitate joint hearings with AR69-1, Phase I. (G) In order to induce producers to dedicate supplies to the interstate mar- ket without waiting for the final price determination of these proceedings, con- tracts dated after the date of this order will have the same price ceilings as con- tracts entered into after the date of the final order herein. (H) A presiding Examiner, designated by the Chief Examiner for that purpose [see Delegation of Authority, 18 CFR 3.5(d) ], shall preside at the hearing in this proceeding; shall prescribe relevant pro- cedural matters not herein provided; and shall control this proceeding in accord- ance with policies expressed in \u00a7 2.59 of the Commission's rules of practice and procedure (18 CFR 2.59). (I) Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to (said proceeding should, on or before July 10, 1970, file with the Federal Power Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a petition to intervene or a notice of in- tervention or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commis- sion's rules of practice and procedure (18 CFR 1.8 or 1.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate ac- tion to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the pro- ceeding. Persons wishing to become par- ties to this proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file petitions to intervene in accordance with the Commission's rules. (J) The Secretary shall cause a copy of this order to be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER and served upon each of the respondents listed in Appendix A, and upon interested State Commissions as is provided for in \u00a7 1.19 of the Com- mission's rules of practice and procedure (11 CFR 1.19).

Take notice that on June 18, 1970, El Paso Natural Gas Co. (Petitioner)-, Post Office Box 1492, El, Paso, Tex. 79999, filed in Docket No. CP64-99 a petition to amend the certificate of public conven- ience and necessity issued to it in this FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 35, NO. 120-SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1970 NOTICES dlocket on February 18, 1964, as previ- ously amended August 7, 1964, Octo- ber 21, 1964, December 15, 1964, June 2, 1965, June 27, 1966, April 11, 1967, July 8, 1968, and on July 22, 1969, all as more fully set forth in the petition on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. The certificate authorizes petitioner, with others, to construct and operate certain facilities for the purpose of test- ing capability for underground natural gas storage in the Jackson Prairie area of Lewis County, Wash. As amended the testing activities are to cease June 30, 1970, and the total expenditure is limited to $14,700,000. A volumetric inventory of 12 million Mcf (at 14.73 p.s.i.a.) is authorized. Petitioner requests that the certificate be further amenided so as to authorize El Paso to inject natural gas into the Storage Project during the period com- mencing on July 1, 1970, and continuing through no later than October 31, 1970. Such extended authorization is required in order to enable completion of the in- jection cycle for natural gas presently being injected into the storage reservoir preparatory to utilization of the Storage Project on a firm, permanent basis com- mencing with the forthcoming 1970-71 heating season. It appears reasonable and consistent with the public interest in this case to prescribe a shortened period for the fling of protests and petitions to intervene. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with refereice to said application should on or before June 26, 1970, file with the Federal Power Com- mission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a peti- tion to intervene or a protest in accord- ance with the requirements of the Com- miSion's rules of practice and procedure (18 CFR 1.8 or 1.10) and the regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Com- mission will be considered by it in deter- mining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceed- ing or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file- a petition to intervene in accordance with the Com- mission's rules. Take further notice that, pursuant tothe authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Power Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's rules of practice and pro- cedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission on this application if no petition to in- tervene is filed within the time requiredherein, if the Commision on its own re- view of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a petition for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion be- lieves that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, It will be unnecessary for Applicant to appear or be represented at the hearing.
