Conventional approach is taken as a given In my experience, cancer patients who combine conventional and alternative treatments will generally do better than those doing only conventional treatment But, might they do even better by NOT doing any conventional therapy at all in some cases? Many of our patients do very well by skipping some of the conventional therapies recommended by conventional oncologists (e.g. automatic use of radiation after lumpectomies for breast cancer) See some previous PPTs of recent lectures CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 6Other Questions about Cancer Treatment to Ponder The question often asked by patients is will nutritional supplements interfere with conventional treatment? Rarely asked is: Will the conventional treatment make the results of alternative treatment results worse? CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 7Keith Block MD; An Integrative Oncologist from the Chicago area Keith I Block MDClaims he uses the best of conventional medicine combined with \"scientifically supported complementary therapies\" Advocates what he calls \"proven ways\" to make conventional treatment more effective while reducing toxicity and side effects of these treatments (See his book!) Works closely with conventional oncologists Conventional therapy is a given and alternative methods are used to reduce adverse effects Recently, one of my patients who lives near him and was looking for a support group was refused because she is alternative, rather than integrative CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 8 Downside of Diagnostic Procedures: Infrequently discussed by Conventional MD's Scans emit considerable radiation and radiation exposure causes cancer CT Scan 100 chest x -rays PET Scan 500 chest x -rays Size of tumor not good marker for longevity of patient ; yet this is what is generally used Success should be measured by survival time and quality of life and not shrinkage of tumors, which are frequently temporary Gadolinium widely used as a dye in MRI's recently given an FDA warning that it is retained in some tissues like the brain Biopsies cause inflammation and may stimulate cancer growth if cancer is present or contribute to the development of cancer if it isn't present; infections, bleeding or other complications are common (e.g. Numerous complications occur following prostate biopsies) CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 9Four Approaches to Killing Cancer Cells without harming Normal Cells Takes advantage of fact that cancer cells differ from normal cells and may have different responses to certain substances: Cancer cells generally have large amounts of the enzyme protein CYP1B1, which is not present or very low in normal cells; allows salvestrols to stimulate cancer cell death, but cause no harm to normal cells Cancer cells are high in the enzyme beta glucosidase which is low in normal cells; this enzyme splits off 2 sugar molecules from amygdalin (Laetrile or B17 ) which then results in release of cyanide and benzaldehyde , both of which are capable of killing cancer cells (but normal cells are unharmed) Pancreatic enzymes preferentially attack cancer cells and not normal cells (work of Gonzalez, Isaacs, Beard and Kelley) High dose vitamin C intravenously forms hydrogen peroxide outside the cells; gets into normal cells and the enzyme catalase converts peroxide to oxygen and water; but cancer cells lack catalase and hydrogen peroxide forms the toxic hydroxyl radical that can kill the cancer cell CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 10Salvestrols: A Relatively Non -Toxic Approach to Controlling Cancer Cells CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 11Prof. Dan Burke did research in the UK Authored over 200 published research studies Early 1990's -Discovered the enzyme protein CYP1B1 present in cancer cells and not in normal cells (ultimately found this to be true in 26 different cancers ); he wondered why it was in cancer cellsCYP1B1 & the Discovery of Salvestrols So, why is CYP1B1 present in cancer cells, but not in normal cells? Hypothesis: CYP1B1 protects against cancer Research found a group of relatively inert substances found in organic plants (fruits, vegetables & herbs) when mixed with CYP1B1 form metabolites that inhibit cancer cell growth; the researchers named them SALVESTROLS Most people suffer from a deficiency of salvestrols, which predisposes them to cancer (few people eat organic foods) Salvestrols have no effect on normal cells which do not have CYP1B1 Various substances inhibit CYP1B1 and should be avoided when taking salvestrols CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 12Effects of Salvestrols on Cancer Cells & Normal Cells; How They Work CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 13CYP1B1 Inhibitors and Substances to Avoid when on Salvestrols Amygdalin=Vitamin B17 = Laetrile or sources like Resveratrol in high doses Citrus flavanone naringenin from grapefruit, especially grapefruit juice Carbon monoxide (present in cigarette smoke) Various herbicides and pesticides, such as Roundup and some household chemicals Herbs, such as: Cannabis , St. John's Wort, Ginkgo biloba, Gin Seng, Hesperidin Artificial Sweeteners interfere with the absorption of salvestrols Calcium D Glucarate may reduce absorption of salvestrols Metformin Drug used for diabetes and cancer There are undoubtedly others Need to avoid CYP1B1 inhibitors for best results with salvestrols CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 14Amygdalin = Laetrile = Vitamin B17 From mid 70's through 2012, most of our cancer patients used B17; some still do; others use salvestrols The narrated film strip \"World Without Cancer\" got me started with alternative cancer therapies in the 1970's Film strip available on YouTube at : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeYMduufa -E Trailer of movie on Laetrile at Sloan Kettering : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGXzLuxwqQs NY Times article opinion -on-the-dispute -over -laetrile.html?_r=0 http://www.schachtercenter.com/IntegrativeOncologyISIMJ ournal.pdf My article on our website includes B17 discussion CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 15Amygdalin with 2 Sugar Molecules bound to Benzaldehyde & Cyanide: Relatively Non -Toxic CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 16The Enzyme Glucosidase (present in CA cells) Splits 2 sugar molecules (S -S) from Benzaldehyde (BZD) and Cyanide (CYD); BZD TOXIC when released from sugarsAmygdalin=Laetrile=Vitamin B17 B17 is a cyanide containing nitriloside Nitrilosides found many foods -such as prunasin family (bitter apricot kernels, apple seeds, peach seeds, pear seeds), millet, buckwheat, cassava and others Structure -2 sugars, benzaldehyde, cyanide Non -toxic when molecule intact Cyanide and benzaldehyde are toxic when separated from sugars Many cancer cells are high in enzyme to release cyanide and benzaldehyde, whereas normal cells lack this enzyme (beta glucosidase); so, B17 selectively attacks cancer cells Can't be used with salvestrols because B17 inhibits CYP1B1, so that salvestrols won't work CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 17Amygdalin -2 Normal cells lack enzymes that remove sugars from the amygdalin molecule Normal cells also have enzymes to detoxify cyanide and benzaldehyde ; Rhodanese is one of them (Converts cyanide to thiocyanate); We use serum thiocyanate to help check both for toxicity and for evidence of efficacy Cancer cells lack these protective enzymes Amygdalin tends to attack cancer cells and leave normal cells alone Used orally and as IV infusion; also can add oral bitter apricot kernels, but these should not be taken within 2 hours of the B17 tablets , as the tablets contain 500 mg of B17 (compared to the kernels which have 5 mg) and the kernels may cause too much cyanide to be released in the gut from the tablets, since the kernels do contain some glucosidase Can use the blood test serum thiocyanate to help to see that the patient's dose is high enough, but not high enough so as to cause toxicity A reasonable plan might be to alternate Salvestrol for a few months with B17 for a few months CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 18Conquering Cancer: 50 Case Histories Incredible case histories of patients using the Gonzalez, Isaacs, Kelley protocol; book published after his death Dr. Gonzalez died of unknown cause in July 2015: See: http://thegonzalezprotocol.com/foundation - video/ Description of 50 cases of pancreatic Ca and breast Ca with long -term survival (some 10 to 20 + years) Used his own individualized program with each patient (Individualized diet, detoxification like coffee enemas to detox the liver); pancreatic enzymes to kill cancer cells and a large supplement program Most cases supported by biopsies and scans CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 19Conquering Cancer -Volume 2: 62 Cases CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 20Also published after his death just a few months ago 62 patients with 17 different types of cancer with unexpected long term survival Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma, Bladder, Colon, Kidney, Liver, Leukemia, Lung, Lymphoma, Melanoma, Mesothelioma, Ovarian, Prostate, Salivary Gland, Sarcoma, Thyroid, Uterine, Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia plus a diabetes case report Companion book to Conquering Cancer: Volume One All of these patients have documented diagnoses of cancer . Dr. Gonzalez Protocol Diet is geared to patients metabolic type from extreme vegetarian to extreme animal food users (10 metabolic types) Many nutritional supplements also based on metabolic type to support the autonomic nervous systems, including many glandulars; patients may wind up taking 200 pills or capsules daily Extensive use of specific pancreatic enzymes between meals as cancer cell killers (dosage may be as high as 100 capsules or more daily); with meals to help with digestion; a breast cancer patient being followed by Dr. Isaacs recently told me that she took 16 enzymes between meal 6 times daily and some with meals to help digestion Coffee enemas are recommended to help detoxify ; also gallbladder flushes may be recommended (with olive oil and lemon juice) Dr. Linda Isaacs who had been his partner for many years now runs the practice Practice is selective & takes only patients who are highly motivated to carry on this difficult protocol without adding or subtracting elements & who have had minimal or no conventional treatment CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 21Books by Nicolas Gonzalez MD or Related to His Work and Further Information CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 22 Website showing books by Nicolas Gonzalez MD and related to his work: http://www.dr - gonzalez.com/books.htm There are a few additional books recently added Coffee Enemas: Short video in which Dr. Gonzalez explains the value of coffee enemas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qycZ3 mfmQBM Treatment -dr-gonzalez -part-1/ Linda Isaacs MD : Long Term Associate of Dr. Gonzales: See: http://www.drlindai.com/ Dr. Isaacs and Dr. Gonzalez worked together in private practice in NYC starting in the 80's She continues their work Patients must be highly motivated to do their difficult program Pancreatic enzymes kill cancer cells Question: Might elements of their protocol be used with some elements that they didn't use (B17 or Salvestrols or Vitamin C drips)? CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 23Vitamin C as a Relatively Non -Toxic Anti -Cancer Strategy Vitamin C has numerous ways of helping the body fight cancer It enhances functioning of the immune system by several mechanisms, strengthens connective tissue surround the cancer, thereby reducing the likelihood of metastases At high concentrations, achieved only by intravenous treatment , vitamin C or ascorbic acid converts to hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular spaces When hydrogen peroxide enters normal cells , the enzyme catalase converts it to oxygen and water Cancer cells have only small amounts of catalase and the hydrogen peroxide converts to the very damaging hydroxyl radical , which can kill cancer cells For more information about C and cancer, see my article which has a good discussion about C and cancer and contains has many references See: http://schachtercenter.com/CSJARTICLE0001.PDF Pages 3 through 5 CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 24High Dose Oral Vitamin C for CA Patients CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 2510 grams or more of vitamin C give orally extends life of cancer patients by more than 4 times according to one study Study in the 70's and 80's length of life in 100 terminal CA patients receiving at least 10 grams daily of vitamin C compared to 1000 patients who didn't (8 year study) http://www.peakenergy.com/news/Vitami nC_Cancer_w_Comments.pdf http://vitamincfoundation.org/alerts.php Relatively inexpensive cancer control strategyLinus Pauling PhD and Ewan Cameron MD: Champions of Oral C for CancerHigh Dose IV Ascorbate (Vitamin C) Drip to Treat Cancer Patients at the Schachter Center Used at our Center -more than 40 years Published clinical cases show treatment plausible Dosage of Vitamin C -25 to 100 Grams (our usual maximum dose is 60 grams per infusion) Administered over 2 -3 hours Treatment one to three times a week; some clinics do it daily When used with chemotherapy (given by other MDs) -patients report that they feel much better IV B17 can be given in a separate infusion after the C drip Sometimes given with IV Alpha Lipoic Acid in a separate infusion A discussion about oral and IV vitamin C appears in my article at: http://schachtercenter.com/CSJARTICLE0001.PDF 26 CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBSLow Vitamin D Levels Associated with Cancer 3,000 studies indicating that serum 25 Hydroxy vitamin D levels inversely associated with cancer ; Check 25 Hydroxy D; Optimal around 80 (Ref Range 30 to 100); Rarely checked by Cancer Centers 75 epidemiologic studies suggest low D levels associated with increase in cancer Vitamin D upregulates (generally anti -inflammatory and anti -cancer genes) and downregulates (pro -cancer & pro -inflammatory) genes (about 3,000) Number of genes affected keeps rising!!!

To reduce this damage, the radiation is fired at the tumor from a series of different directions. This ensures that the cancerous tumor will receive a full dose while the surrounding healthy tissue receives a much lower dose .Two Recently Published Books are Potential Game Changers for How Health and Disease are Viewed The Plant Paradox by Steven Gundry MD -Released July 2017 The End of Alzheimer's by Dale Bredesen -Released August 2017 Both authors have impeccable conventional credentials , one as a cardiovascular surgeon and the other as a neurologist and researcher Both published extensively about their work in peer reviewed journals Both seriously question accepted medical dogma Both believe that the major way of managing chronic degenerative diseases is by changes in lifestyle, diet & use of nutritional supplements Both books give precise suggestions on what to do; both use lab results to help with specifics of the program CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 39Steven R Gundry MD: \" The Plant Paradox : The Hidden Dangers in ' Healthy ' Foods that Cause Disease and Weight Gain \" CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 40Former cardiovascular surgeon who did many heart transplants on children Was professor and chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at Loma Linda Univ in California Resigned from this position because in 2001 he became convinced that he could better help cardiac patients by teaching them how to eat Author of more than 300 journal articles on how to help patients with heart disease with diet and supplements Published papers showing a 2% event rate in 10,000 known coronary artery pts over a 12 - year period, far superior to any conventional TxThe Plant Paradox Program CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 41The Paradox : Plants supply us with food for nourishment , but also produce toxic substances to ward off predators like insects and us Lectins are sticky proteins produced by plants that are potentially toxic to insects and animals Many \"healthy\" foods we eat are high in lectins (whole grains and the nightshade family); gluten is one example of a lectin that can be harmful to many Lectins and sugar adversely affect our immune system , gut and brain leading to leaky gut, autoimmune diseases like arthritis, Crohn's disease and coronary artery disease and contribute to weight gain The program consists of foods low in lectins, sugars and devoid of any artificial chemicals like artificial sweeteners Other Elements of the Plant Paradox Program Essential to Healing Seven disruptors, widespread in our society contribute to chronic degenerative diseases (broad spectrum antibiotics, NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors and others). Discussed in detail in the book Numerous case histories involving various autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's and coronary artery disease recovered on this program and are described in the book; also patients who are overweight, invariably lose weight on this program Dr. Gundry emphasizes that what is eliminated from the diet is more important than what one eats in terms of healing In one published paper, Dr. Gundry asserted that the \"event\" rate (death, heart attack, coronary artery bypass surgery) was only 2% in 10,000 patients following his program over a 12 -year period. This is far superior to any conventional approach to coronary artery disease The program is a comprehensive dietary and supplement approach to all chronic disease including cancer CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 42Dale Bredesin MD: The End of Alzheimer's: The First Program to Prevent and Reverse Cognitive Decline CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 43 Internationally recognized as an expert in the mechanisms of neurodegenerative disease Has held faculty positions at several California universities, including UCLA Published peer reviewed articles on his work with Alzheimer patients Explains and exposes the difficulty of getting new ideas accepted when the paradigm is already taken as a given This book can serve as a guide for professional caregivers as well as the families of Alzheimer patientsThe End of Alzheimer's: The First Program to Prevent and Reverse Cognitive Decline CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 44David Perlmutter MD -author of Grain Brain says on the cover: \"A Monumental Work\" For the first time in history, more than 200 patients with documented Alzheimer's showed significant improvement during the past 5 years Rather than looking for one factor being responsible for Alzheimer's, Dr. Bredesen found at least 36 factors that may be involved (analogy of roof with 36 holes) These factors relate to diet, sleep, exercise, stress, hormone levels, vitamin levels; blood test results are used to guide the treatment He developed a total wholistic approach dealing with as many as these factors as possibleReversing Declining Cognitive Decline ( RECODE ) Program He aims to make lab test results optimal, rather than within the reference range (e.g. vit.D3 blood level: 50 to 80, rather than 30 to 100) He relates genetic predisposition (presence of apolipoprotein E4 ) to environmental factors (reducing inflammation) to how to reduce the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's He shows how AD is caused by the destruction of brain cells being greater than the creation of new brain cells (analogous to osteoporosis) dispelling the false belief that we are born with the number of brain cells we have This process is reversed with his program Dr. Bredesen divides Alzheimer's into 3 categories: (1) Inflammatory; (2) Lack of necessary nutrients; (3) Toxic; however they may overlap His therapeutic program is called: Recode: Reversing cognitive decline Improvement can occur if several (not necessarily all) of the factors are addressed CARE Nov 9 2017 New Developments -MBS 45Program to Certify RECODE Practitioners Dr. Bredesen realized that the conventional model of disease which attempts to find a drug to control or cure a disease is NOT applicable to Alzheimer's disease. He needed a model which stresses find the many causes of a condition and then correcting them (usually without the need for a drug) Over the past 5 years, he has seen improvement in over 200 patients with AD. According to conventional dogma, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE The functional medicine approach is a great paradigm to fit his findings for helping Alzheimer's patients; his group is partnering with the Institute for Functional Medicine (IFM) to teach this approach Several hundred practitioners have been trained in RECODE and the next training program is in Miami at the beginning of December in person or by livestream. I will be participating in the livestream program; the cost is $1,800.
