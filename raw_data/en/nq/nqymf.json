(3) OJ L 128, 21.05.1 999, p. 1.28.5.2003 L 132/1 Official Journal of the European Union ENA/66323), Greece informed the Commission that a reply would be completed by 25 September 2002. Thereply by the Greek authorities was sent on 1 October(DG TREN(2002) A/67131). (7) On 1 6 of October 2002, a meeting was held with theGreek authorities concerning the state of play on OA's financial developments and progress realised to that date. During this meeting, the representatives of Greece remitted a document called 'Reporting to the Commission' which has been registered under the reference DG TREN(2002) A/69882.

Past Commission decisions regarding OA and its subsidiaries 2.1.1. The 1994 Decision (10) On 7 October 1 994 the Commission adopted the decision 94/696/EC (hereafter 'the 1 994 decision')according to which aid granted or to be granted by Greece to OA was declared compatible with the common market under Article 87(3)(c) (then 92(3)(c)) ofthe EC Treaty and under Article 61(3)(c) of the agreement on the European Economic Area (hereafter 'the EEA agreement') provided that Greece met a seriesof commitments listed therein. The aid packageconsisted of the following measures:\u2014 Loan guarantees extended to OA to 7 October 1 994 pursuant to Article 6 of Greek Law No 96 of 26June 1975; \u2014 New loan guarantees totalling USD 378 million for loans to be contracted before 31 December 1 997 forthe purchase of new aircraft; \u2014 Easing of OA's debt burden by GRD 427 billion;\u2014 Conversion of GRD 64 billion of OA's debt into equity; \u2014 A capital injection of GRD 54 billion in three instalments of GRD 19, 23 and 12 billion in 1995, 1996 and 1997 respectively. The last four of these five measures formed part of a restructuring and recapitalisation plan for OA, whichhad initially been submitted to the Commission. On thisbasis, the Commission considered that the aid wouldfacilitate the development of air transport activity by restructuring the main air carrier of a fragmented, peripheral region of the Community, of which Greece isone of the least developed parts. (1 1) The compatibility of the aid was, however, conditional on compliance by Greece with the 21 commitments,which were given to ensure that the aid did notadversely affect trading conditions to an extent contraryto the common interest. According to thesecommitments, which concerned both OA and its subsidiary Olympic Aviation, Greece was required to meet among the 21 commitments the following: (a) To repeal by 31 December 1994, Article 6 of the Greek Law No 96/75 of 26 June 1975 which permitted the Greek State to extend guarantees forthe loans contracted by OA; (b) Not to interfere in the management of OA except within the strict limits of its role as shareholder; (c) To give OA, by 31 December 1 994, the fiscal status of a public limited company comparable to that of Greek undertakings under ordinary law, except, however, for exonerating OA from any taxes likelyto affect the recapitalisation operations envisaged in therecapitalisation and restructuring plan communicated to the Commission; (d) Not to grant any further aid to OA in any form whatsoever, in conformity with Community law;L 132/2 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union EN(e) To have adopted immediately the legislation necessary for the effective implementation of thesalary, social and financial aspects of therestructuring plan; (f) To submit to the Commission each year, at least four weeks before payment of each instalment of thecapital increase scheduled in January 1996 andJanuary 1997 , a report on the implementation of therestructuring plan to enable the Commission tocomment and to postpone by four weeks paymentof those instalments should the Commission wish tosubmit the report in question for scrutiny by anindependent consultant; (g) Not to carry out the capital increases scheduled in 1 995, 1996 and 1997 if the objectives of therestructuring plan, as set out in the 1 994 decision, had not been attained for the previous years; (h) To ensure that OA did not act as price leader on the scheduled routes Athens-Stockholm andAthens-London during the period 1 994 to 1997inclusive; (i) To ensure that throughout the entire duration of the restructuring plan, the number of seats offered by OA on scheduled flights within the European Economic Area (EEA), including addition andseasonal flights, but excluding domestic flights tothe Greek islands, would not exceed what has beenoffered by OA in the EEA market in 1993; (j) To ensure that the remaining loan guarantees extended to OA and the new guarantees to beextended before 31 December 1997 explicitlyprovided for by the restructuring plan to theamount of USD 378 million, comply with theconditions set out in the letter of 5 April 1989 fromthe Commission to the Member States; 2.1.2. The 1998 Decision (12) However, due to the fact that several of the conditions attached to that decision had not been observed, the Commission decided on 30 April 1 996 (4) to reopen the procedure provided for by Article 87(2) of the Treaty,and to initiate proceedings with regard to new andnon-notified aid of which it had been informed. (13) In particular, the Commission's doubts concerned thefollowing:(1) The commitment by Greece not to interfere in the management of OA in future except within thestrict limits of its role as a shareholder. Indeed, itappeared at the time that the Greek Governmentinterfered in the management of OA, either directlyor through the board. (2) The commitment by Greece not to grant any further aid, as OA had been exempted from taxation orpublic levies for the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 ,from all taxes and other expenses in respect of theloan guarantees, as well as from costs related to themilitary service by OA's employees. These benefitsamounting to GRD 1 1 billion. Also, it appeared that OA was not paying landing and parking fees since the 1994 Decision was notified to Greece. (3) The commitment by Greece to bring the agreements with OA in line with the provisions of the thirdpackage appeared to be not complied with as Greece delayed unduly the abolition of OA's exclusive right to operate domestic flights withincontinental Greece. (4) The commitment by Greece to give OA the fiscal status of a public limited company comparable tothat of Greek companies under ordinary (company)law appeared to be not complied with, as variousprovisions of Greek Law No 2271/94 exempted OAgenerally from taxation inasmuch this was linked tothe reorganisation of the structure of OA's balancesheet. (5) The commitment by Greece to accept that airlines other than OA are authorised to operate flight tocountries outside the EEA appeared to be notcomplied with, as there was still no legislation inforce terminating OA's exclusive rights on suchroutes. (14) On 14 August 1998, the Commission adopted decision 1 999/332/EC (hereafter 'the 1998 decision') accordingto which the aid granted or to be granted by Greece to OA was compatible with the common market by virtue of Article 87(3)(c) of the EC Treaty (then Article 92(3)(c)) and of Article 61(3)(c) of the EEA agreement. Theaid comprised: (a) Loan guarantees granted to the company until 7 October 1 994 pursuant to Article 6 of Greek Law No 96/75 of 26 June 1 975; (b) New loan guarantees totalling USD 378 millions for loans to be contracted before 31 December 1 997 forthe purchase of new aircraft; (4) OJ C 17 6, 19.6.1996, p. 5.28.5.2003 L 132/3 Official Journal of the European Union EN(c) Easing of the undertaking's debt burden by GRD 427 billion; (d) Conversion of GRD 64 billion of the undertaking's debt to equity; (e) A capital injection of GRD 40,8 billion, reducing the originally foreseen GRD 54 billion and in threeinstalments of GRD 19, 14 and 7 ,8 billionrespectively in 1995, 1 998 and 1 999. (15) The aid measures approved by the 1 998 decision were accompanied by a revised restructuring plan (hereafter 'the plan'). This plan (5) concerned the period 1998-2002. The initial restructuring plan provided forthe improvement of yield and revenue management,operating cost reduction based on organisational restructuring and changes in the working terms (freezeof salaries, reduction of allowances, decreased overtimein relation to permanent personnel, reduction of thenumber of the seasonal staff), changes in themanagement. The 1998 plan confirmed the initialmeasures and contained additional measures to achievethe reorganisation of the cost structure of the company(wage freezing, reduction of staff etc.) and animprovement of the yields through the introduction ofyield management. It also foresaw the redimensioning ofthe network, a company-wide reorganisation of thecompany's internal structure and in relation toinvestment for the acquisition of aircraft. Other measures referred to the relocation of OA to Athens International Airport of Spata (hereafter 'AIA') andadditional infrastructure investment to take placewithout new capital to be drawn from the shareholder. (1 6) The implementation of the 1998 restructuring plan and the achievement of the financial estimates have been based on the following: indicators 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Financial indicators Turnover (GRD millions) 324 234 329 071 344 829 359 057 380 626 Operating result after interest (GRD millions) 14 610 21 294 9 622 1 644 8 470 Profit before tax (GRD millions) 5 120 20 914 22 587 2 697 6 590Long term debt (GRD millions) 59 501 123 993 191 542 1 71 625 151 708 Operational indicators Average stage length (km) 1 014 1 053 1 087 1 097 1 1 10 Load factors 66,3 % 64,4 % 61,8 % 62,3 % 64,3 % Yields (GRD/RPK ( 1)) \u2014 1998 Prices 100 106 1 10,4 107 ,2 106,1 Number of employees (FTEs) 8 875 8 467 8 256 8 078 8 032 Total number of aircraft 35 37 40 40 40 Average Network Capacity 395 595 365 717 357 409 378 7 45 386 329 Financial ratios Operating result turnover 4,5 % 6,5 % 2,8 % 0,5 % 2,2 % (5) This plan was submitted to the Commission with letters dated 3 and 6 July 1998.L 132/4 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union EN1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Gearing employees 1 560 092 1 598 148 1 731 631 1 875 440 1 923 950 Staff expenditure ASKs 8,46 8,30 7 ,86 7 ,54 7 ,64 Cockpit crew expenditure ASKs 1,38 1,38 1,31 22,37 22,56 23,04 Staff expenditure total operating costs ,8 % 36,5 % 33,5 % 31,9 % 31,7 % Cockpit crew expenditure aviation operating costs 6,5 % 6,4 % 5,9 % 5,6 % 5,6 % Cabin crew expenditure aviation operating costs 6,8 % 6,6 % 6,2 % 6,1 % 6,1 % (1) RPK: Revenue passenger per kilometre. (2) ASK: Available seat per kilometre. (17) The whole scenario has been based on the assumption that OA's aviation revenues would increase by 25,5 %over the duration of the plan (from GRD 269 billion in1998 to GRD 337 ,6 billion in 2002) while groundhandling revenues would decrease by 28,2 % during thesame period (from GRD 46,5 billion in 1 998 to GRD33,3 billion in 2002) as a result of the liberalisation ofthis activity. (18) The aid approved by the 1998 decision was subject to the respect of four conditions listed in Article 1 of thatdecision. These were the following: (a) The integration into the 1 998 decision of the twenty-one commitments given by the Greekauthorities at the occasion the 1 994 decision. (b) Note had been taken of Greece's commitment to ensure that OA would not act as price leader on thescheduled routes Athens-Stockholm andAthens-London during the period 1 998 to 2002inclusive; (c) Note had been taken of Greece's commitment to ensure that until 31 December 2002, the number ofseats offered by OA on scheduled flights in the EEA,including additional and seasonal flights andincluding services between continental Greece andthe Greek islands, would not exceed what OA had offered in the EEA market during 1 997 (7 792 243seats), taking into account, however, a possibleincrease proportional to the growth of the market inquestion; (d) Note has been taken of Greece's commitment to ensure that by 1 December 1998, OA would have implemented a fully operational and adequate Management Information System. Greece wasrequested to submit by 1 December 1998 a reportto the Commission on this matter. (19) Moreover, the decision stipulated, that the payment ofthe instalment of GRD 7 ,8 billion was to be subject to compliance with all the conditions attached to the decision in order to secure the compatibility of the aidwith the common market and the actualimplementation of the revised restructuring plan andachievement of the expected results, in particular asregards the cost and productivity ratios set out in thatdecision. (20) In order to take into account the fact that the 1998restructuring plan extended the original plan beyond1 997 and allowing OA to reach viability by 2000, the Commission requested further commitments to ensure the effectiveness of the aid and its compatibility withthe common market. (21) Accordingly, the 1998 decision foresaw, that Greece hadthe obligation to submit a report to the Commission inthe following cases:28.5.2003 L 132/5 Official Journal of the European Union EN(a) at least ten weeks before the payment of the above mentioned second instalment planned for 15 June1 999 and, (b) by the end of the months of October 1 999, March 2000 and October 2000. (22) The reports would confirm that all conditions imposed were fully respected to ensure the compatibility of theaid and the implementation of the revised restructuringplan and thus eventual achievement of the estimatedresults. Accordingly, payment of that instalment was notto be released if all or part of the conditions were notrespected and/or the objectives of the revisedrestructuring plan were not met. The decision did notforesee any contingency plan nor provided for anyexemption to that obligation. 2.1.3. The 2000 Decision (23) By letter of 1 7 July 2000 Greece notified the Commission its intention to use the remaining authorised aid for loan guarantees to be contractedbefore the end of 2000 for investment in relation to therelocation of OA from Hellinikon airport to the newAthens international airport at Spata, and to extend thedeadline for the loan guarantees to 31 March 2001. Bythen the Greek State had issued loan guarantees totalling USD 201,6 million for the purchase of four Airbus 340. By letter of 10 November 2000(SG(2000)D/108307), the Commission informed the Greek authorities of its decision to amended Article 1 (1)(ii) of the 1998 decision with regard to the aidmeasure concerning the loan guarantees totalling USD378 million. Following this modification, the aidmeasure in question consisted of new loan guaranteestotalling USD 378 million for loans to be contractedbefore 31 December 2000 for the purchase of newaircraft and for investment necessary for the relocationof Olympic Airways to the new airport at Spata. Theseloan guarantees could be issued by 31 March 2001. (24) In February 2001, OA contracted a loan ofapproximately GRD 62 billion from ABN-AMRO in thisrespect. 2.2. OA's economic and management development from 1998 to 2002 (25) Following the adoption of the 1998 Decision, the Greekgovernment released in September 1998 to OA thesecond tranche of the capital injection of GRD 15 billion and issued part of the State guarantees, whichwere authorised for an amount of USD 378 million forthe fleet renewal of OA, in particular in respect to fournew Airbus 340-400 aircraft. (26) In May 1999 Greece submitted to the Commission areport on the implementation of OA's 1 998 restructuring plan and supplemented it by a Memorandum in June 1 999. This report was scrutinisedby an independent expert (Deloitte & Touche) inaccordance with the provisions of the 1998 decision(Article 1(a) of that decision and Article 1 \u2014commitment (h) of the 1994 decision). (27) The report was based on 1997 audited results, on 1 998 management estimates and budgeted forecasts for 1999. The report came to the result that OA had significantly under-performed the plan. Hence, a number of projected targets of the 1 998 decision had not been achieved on time since, according to the Greekauthorities 'The actual 1997 results exceeded the mostpessimistic estimate made in late February 1998'.Indeed, the actual 1997 operating result after interestamounted to a loss of GRD 28 billion (approx. EUR 82million) against a previewed profit of approx. GRD 1.7billion (approx. EUR 5 million). This poor performancehad been caused by loss of revenue due to reducedactivity levels, for which labour disruption were partlyresponsible. While load factors had not deviated fromthe plan, the report indicated that this was achieved atthe expense of yield. The main cause for suchdegradation was due to agents' commissions discountslarger than expected. Management had suffered from alack of control over behaviour in relation to agents'incentives and it was doubtful whether instruments allowing such control were yet put in place at that moment. In addition, performance has been poor due tolack of punctuality, ageing aircraft, strikes and resultingflight cancellations. (28) To counterbalance this underperformance the company claimed to have undertaken austerity measures and tohave introduced strict financial practice from February1 998 to August 1999. Despite these efforts and givenalso the labour unrest experienced during that period \u2014it should be noted however, that the restructuring Plan had estimated costs amounting to GRD 15 billion for such disruptions. In actual terms, costs generated wereof GRD 12 billions and thus 3 billion less thanestimated (Report Deloitte & Touche, 21 July 1 999, p.22 \u2014 the objectives set in the plan for 1998 could notL 132/6 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ENbe reached and an operating loss after interest of GRD 10,4 billion (EUR 30,4 million) against a previewedprofit of GRD 14,6 billion (EUR 42,3 million) wasaccumulated. Contrary to this, Greece confirmed themanagement's commitment to the restructuring planand to the objectives laid down therein. (29) The analysis of the shortcomings in the state of implementation of the 1 998 plan by the report ofDeloitte & Touche showed that it would not allow the Commission to take a positive decision on the release of the last instalment. The Commission transmitted thisanalysis to the Greek authorities by letters of 12 and 1 9May and of 27 July 1 999. The Commission also invited Greece to submit an updated restructuring plan for OA, which would then be examined by the Commission inrelation to the capital injection of GRD 7 ,8 billion (EUR22,8 million). In their reply to the Commission of 26August 1999, Greece accepted that implementation ofthe 1998 to 2002 restructuring plan would have to befurther revised to meet the previewed results and toallow the Commission to consider positively thegranting of the last instalment. (30) To address these concerns, and in order that 'no more restructuring time would be wasted' (Memorandum of Greek authorities of 1 1 April 2002.) the Hellenic authorities had already decided and informed the Commission by letter of 7 July 1999 of their intention to appoint, through an international open tender, anexperienced international management to run theairline. Speedwing the consultancy subsidiary of British Airways (herafter 'BA'), was finally awarded the management contract, which also provided for BA'soption to purchase a stake of up to 20 % in OA withinone year from signing the management contract. (31) After a meeting in August 1 999 between the newmanagement team formed by Speedwing and Commission's officials in Brussels, the Greek authorities submitted by letter of 1 8 November 1 999 a modifiedrestructuring plan for OA prepared by Speedwing. Bothcompanies, however, already started its implementationbefore its formal approval by the Commission. Deloitte& Touche examined the plan and expressed concern onsome of its aspects. The key difference between theSpeedwing plan and the plan approved in the Commission's decision of 1998 as applied in 1 998 and early 1999 was a focus on revenue increase and expansion of the company's activities. Deloitte & Touche qualified in their initial report the Speedwing plan as'ambitious'. The Greek authorities themselves confirmedin their memorandum of 1 1 April 2002 that 'thephilosophy of this plan was far distant from thephilosophy of the previously authorised plan since it was mainly focusing on expansion and revenuemaximisation than on the cost side'. (32) By letter of 20 March 2000, the Commission submittedthe final draft of the Deloitte & Touche report,confirming the initial concerns to the Greek authorities. Therein, the Commission expressed its concerns about the failure to implement the revised restructuring planas authorised by the 1998 decision. Speedwingcontested the conclusions of the Deloitte & Touchereport and replied to the Commission before departingfrom the management of OA in mid-2000. By letter of29 August 2000 to the Commission, the Greek Authorities confirmed that OA had no official results for 1 999 in the form of audited accounts and committedthemselves not to grant the last capital injection. Greeceasked the Commission to abstain from adopting adecision with regard to that matter. (33) In parallel, the Greek authorities and the newmanagement, put in place after Speedwing's departurewanted to re-assess the overall financial situation of thecompany in order to make 1999 a sound basis forfurther OA restructuring. In addition, the managementintended to 'neutralize' some of the long-term effects ofdecisions taken by Speedwing management that wouldhave a negative impact on the finances of the Companyand to 'start to put emphasis on the cost efficiency ofthe airline' (Greek reply of 1 1 April 2002). In autumn2000 PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) were asked by OAto provide a compilation report on un-audited preliminary consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 1999. The findings made by PwC mentioned,among others, that, in application of Law 2271/94 asamended by Law 2465/97 (Article 14), corporate taxwas payable by OA and its subsidiary Olympic Aviationon taxable profits as from 1994. However, from PwC'sreport it resulted that books and records of thecompanies forming the OA and Olympic Aviation hadnot been audited by the tax authorities for a number ofyears, as early as 1 988 (Olympic Aviation) or 1 992(Olympic Airways). Furthermore, the 1 999 statutoryfinancial statements for OA and Olympic Aviation hadnot at the time (December 2000) been approved by therespective general meetings of shareholders. (34) After this thorough examination of the financialsituation of OA, following the departure of the Speedwing management, the Greek authorities acknowledged in summer 2000 that it would not bepossible to achieve the restructuring of OA solely on thebasis of own funds or a sale of a minority stake. In earlysummer 2000 the Greek authorities informed the28.5.2003 L 132/7 Official Journal of the European Union ENCommission of their decision to proceed with the sale of a majority stake of OA in order to achieve thefinancing of the airline. In September 2000, the Greekauthorities appointed Credit Suisse First Boston, asfinancial advisor, as well as a number of other advisorsas required by the Greek Law on privatisation 2000/91.Meanwhile, the reports due for March and October2000 in application of the 1998 decision had not beencommunicated to the Commission. (35) The 1 998 decision also provided as part of the plan thatOA's move to AIA would be financed by cash flow and compensation (point 82 of the 1 998 decision). Thecompany would, however, have been grantedcompensation by the Greek State for the loss ofinvestments at Hellenikon airport as a result of itsclosure (estimated at GRD 35 billion). With regard tothis compensation, the Greek State had confirmed to the Commission by letter of 3 July 1 998 that the compensation would not involve any element of aid to OA and that it would strictly correspond to what any other company in a similar situation would be entitled to receive. In addition, in order to react to the Commission's concerns with regard to the timing of this compensation, Greece had also reassured the Commission that on the basis of the agreement to be reached between OA and the Greek State, paymentwould coincide with the company's expendituresincurred by its move to AIA airport. (36) By letter of 12 December 1 999 Greece informed the Commission that the compensation to OA directly linked with its move to AIA was estimated by theconsultancy American Appraisal, UK, employed by the Greek State to determine the losses that OA would incur as a result of the closure of Hellinikon and its move toAIA at GRD 33,66 billion as of 20 April 1999. (37) This report was transmitted to the Commission, without however a formal notification for additional State aid. The Commission appointed Alan Stratford to verify whether the appraisal carried out by the consultancyAmerican Appraisal was based on the 'fair market value'principle and whether it involved anyovercompensation. Alan Stratford, after havingexamined OA's situation at Hellinikon and the methodof application of the fair market value principle,concluded in its final report of May 2000, that thecalculations and the resulting amounts were reasonable.Nevertheless, it also questioned the necessity ofincluding equipment as a compensation item and whether certain historic benefits enjoyed by OA at Hellinikon should be offset by compensation. Accordingto the consultant if Greece had used anothermethodology proposed by Alan Stratford (especially inrespect of life assumptions on buildings) 'the calculatedcompensation figure would be significantly increased'. OA moved its operations in time to Athens International Airport at Spata, which opened on 28March 2001. The same day Hellinikon was closed. (38) At the end of January 2002, OA contracted a loan ofEUR 19,5 million from the Commercial Bank of Greece,a public commercial bank, on the basis of anassignment from OA to that bank of its claims againstthe Greek State for unpaid air tickets for an amount ofEUR 22 millions. The loan was granted for one year. 2.3. The HACA complaints (39) The Commission received two sets of complaints on 12 October 2000 and 24 July 2001 by HACA. Members of the HACA are the following air carriers: AegeanAirlines, Cronus Airlines, Hellenic Star Airways, CalAviation, Trans European Airlines, Interjet, Avionic andAviator. They concerned: (a) preferential payment allowances to OA workforce, (b) unclarity of the Greek Law 2733/99 providing for the offset of debts between OA and the Greek State, (c) the non payment in time of some landing and parking charges at Hellinikon Airport and the nonpayment of airport charges to AIA; (d) the arrears in payment of the Spatosimo (a passenger tax for the development of Greek airports) of ca EUR 47 million (GRD 1 6 billion), (e) default or substantial delay for paying rent of premises and landing charges to other Greekairports that Hellinikon and/or AIA; (f) V AT relief on fuel and spare parts for Olympic Aviation for a financial benefit of EUR 2,6 million, (g) default or substantial delay for paying social security contributions, default or substantial delay for paying V AT at 8 % on domestic fares, default or substantial delay for paying amounts due to Olympic Catering.L 132/8 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union EN3.THE DECISION OF 6 MARCH 2002 3.1. Grounds for investigation (40) The replies given by the Greek authorities to the complaints on 1 9 February 2001, 7 and 1 1 December2001, as well as 12 March 2002 did not dissipated the Commission's doubts, hence it decided to reopen the formal investigation procedure laid down in Article88(2) of the Treaty. The grounds for investigations weretwofold and are cited below: 1.Abusive application of aid granted in the 1994 and 1998 Commission Decisions (41) a) The non respect of the restructuring plan: Therestructuring plan that served as the basis for the 1 998authorisation has apparently not been implemented as foreseen. In particular, the changes in the organisational structure of the company have not taken place, themanagement layers having essentially remained thesame. The number of employees have decreased morethan what was foreseen in the restructuring plan (seeparagraphs 1 1-17), however, this appears to be due onlyto the spinning-off of activities into its subsidiariespreviously carried out by OA. While employees' salarieshave been frozen for 1 996 to 1997 , the resultingreduction in production costs was largely cancelled bysignificant raise in salaries in 1998. (42) It is worth noting that the objectives of therestructuring plan that served as a basis for the 1998decision were never achieved. This resulted from OA'sfinancial situation as described earlier herein. Based onthe information given above the Commission haddoubts as to whether OA's economic and financialdevelopment corresponded to the plan covering theperiod 1998 to 2002 on the basis of which the aidmeasures where approved with the 1998 decision. Inparticular, since the Commission had not received anyinformation about the financial results of the company in 2000 or any estimates for 2001 and given that Speedwing failed to produce a business andrestructuring plan observing the targets set out in the1998 decision, the Commission had serious doubts as tothe current financial situation of the company beingfurther apart from the targets set out for the years 2000to 2002 in the restructuring plan. (43) Against the requirements of Article 1 paragraph 2 ofthe 1998 decision, no report on the implementation ofthe plan was submitted to the Commission in Marchand in October 2000. Moreover, the absence of information and of credible accountancy on the resultsof the company does not enable in any case the Commission to fully verify the respect of this essential condition without further investigation. (44) It resulted from the above that the economic andfinancial projections upon which this plan waselaborated by the Greek State and approved by the Commission have not been continuously met. Monitoring of the implementation of the restructuringplan indicated the existence of serious doubts as to thecontinuous compatibility of OA's current economic andfinancial situation with the operational and financialindicators of that plan. These doubts were of suchnature that justify that the Commission re-examined the1 998 decision with regards to the correctimplementation of the restructuring plan. (45) b) The non-respect of the conditions andcommitments of the previous decisions. Article 1(d) ofthe 1998 decision requires Greece to ensure that OAwould have implemented a fully operational andadequate management information system (hereafter'MIS') by 1 December 1 998. To date, the Greek authorities have not submitted a report to the Commission about the MIS nor have they informed it about the degree of its implementation and its results. (46) The 1998 decision required Greece to have set up a fully operational and adequate management information system by 1 December 1998. The purpose of setting up the MIS was to allow the management of OA to receiveadequate information to monitor the results of therestructuring plan and further amend the plan ifnecessary. Also, it should be noted that on the basis ofthe restructuring plan which formed the core of the1 998 decision, the Greek State was obliged to establishconsolidated accounts for OA and its subsidiaries.Accurate input for setting up such accounts would stemfrom a fully operational and adequate MIS. (47) The Commission had put emphasis on the absolute necessity of this step, not only for the respect of thedecision's condition itself, but much more for the ownsake of the company. The experience of the 1 997accounts, described earlier (see paragraph 26), easilyproved the difficulty to reach targets set in a planwithout a proper starting point. Generally speaking, thisimplies that the management of a company can onlytake the right decisions to address a situation for thefuture if it has a coherent, precise, accurate and timelyprepared picture of the past actions and achievements and/or failures. Such a management tool also implies that the underlying information, recorded in theaccounting systems of the companies is timely andaccurately processed, controlled and reported to themanagement.28.5.2003 L 132/9 Official Journal of the European Union EN(48) Article 1(a) of the 1998 decision requires Greece to fulfil the undertakings referred to in Article 1(a) to (u) of the 1994 decision. For better understanding of the legal context within which OA should have been functioning as any other commercial company since 1994 under common commercial law, the following isbeing recalled: OA is a public undertaking, that does notform part of the Greek public administration and issubject to the provisions of private law, most notablythose of Law No 2190/1920 governing the form andfunctioning of private limited companies ('AnonymosEteria' - 'Societ\u00e9 Anonyme'). Such companies are subjectto strict publicity obligations. However, even though OAwas listed under registry No 422/01/B/86/423, itsarticles of association do not form part of either thispublication or any other, according to informationavailable to the Commission. (49) Also, Law No 21 90/1920 in its article 25 requires thegeneral meeting of shareholders to meet within sixmonths after the end of each financial year in order todiscuss and approve the financial statements of the company for the year which has ended. Also, according to article 43b \u00a75 of the same law, the managing board of a private limited company has to publish thefinancial statements of the company for the previousfinancial year at least 20 days before the generalmeeting of the shareholders. However, OA published itsfinancial statement for the year 1 999 only on 28December 2001. This statement was established on 31March 2001 by the CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of thecompany and the general manager. It was examined byauditors on 1 1 December 2001. Clearly, these datesindicate that the requirement of the law that isapplicable to any other private limited company wasnot respected. Without prejudice to any further actionby the Commission that this situation may give raisewith regards to the application of Articles 3(1) and 5 (6)of Council Regulation (EEC) 2407/92 of 23 July 1992 on air carrier licensing ( 6), this matter is of particular importance for the competitive position in the marketof OA and its competitors when considering that thestatement of the auditors, for the year ended on 31December 1 999, draws the attention to the fact that theown funds of the company have fallen bellow 50 % ofthe share capital. In fact, it appears that for the financialyear 1999 own funds (GRD 33 699 706 104 or EUR98,89 million) correspond only to 27 ,8 % of the sharecapital (GRD 120 947 970 000 or EUR 354,94 million). This situation has according to article 47 of Law No 2190/1920 the consequence, that the managing boardhas to call a meeting of the shareholders to decide thedissolution of the company or other measures to redressthe financial situation of the company. (50) This particular aspect raises further serious doubts.Therefore, it appears necessary to examine theconditions under which OA and its subsidiaries have been able to remain active after 1999 withoutrestructuring measures and against what is foreseen innormal Commercial law. The Commission recalls thatsuch situation, apart from being a breach of thecommitments and conditions foreseen in the previousdecisions, may also imply an aid element (see Court ofJustice, Case Magefesa, C-480/98). (51) The same can be said (7) about both OA's legal and fiscal status as well as the situation of its payments tothe Greek State. These indicate, that the undertaking hasbeen able to continue its business at least since 1999without complying with their tax, and social securityobligations as well as with their obligations to make duepayments for airport charges, levies, rentals and fees tovarious Greek airports and to the Greek State itself. (52) The current situation of default on or deferred payments of airport charges, taxes, rentals, fees and any otherlevies to Greek airports and the Greek State raisesdoubts as to whether OA is granted new state aid, which is contrary to the 1 998 decision and apparently further distorts competition among air carriersoperating services to/from Greece. (53) The Commission draws particularly the attention of theGreek authorities to the extremely difficult situation ofOA's competitors. In that context, particular reference is made to Axon Airlines. Also, other competitors such as Cronus Airlines and Aegean Airlines are facing significant difficulties, which appear to be partially dueto the fact that, legally and financially, OA is not treatedeven-handedly by the Greek State. It appears thereforelikely that OA's current situation regarding the paymentof its obligations to Greek airports and the Greek Stateconstitute aid against the common interest. (54) OA's legal and fiscal status. A series of laws subject OA to the direct supervision and control of Ministriesproviding for rights and obligations, which deviateexplicitly from that law. Also, certain other Greek laws (6) OJ L 240, 24.8.1992, p. 1.(7) See in particular case C-480/98, points 20-21, European Court Reports 2000, Page I-8717 .L 132/10 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ENprovide OA exclusively with fiscal benefits, which do not apply to private limited companies or any otherform of commercial company. (55) These provisions appear to be against the commitment of the Greek State to ensure that: (a) from a management and status point of view (part VII of the 1994 decision and Article 1(a) and (c) thereof), OA would have the fiscal status of a publiclimited company become an undertaking subject toordinary law on the same footing as the other Community airlines with no special privileges or constraints, (b) it would not interfere in the management of OA except within the strict limits of its role asshareholder (Article 1(b) of the 1 994 decision), (c) it would have adopted immediately the legislation necessary for the effective implementation of thesalary, social and financial aspects of the plan(Article 1(f) of the 1 994 decision). The legislation in question is the following: (56) Law 2271/94 and Law 2602/98: In the 1998 decision the Commission considered that Article 2(12)(a) andArticle 4 of Law 2271/94 which aims at implementingthe restructuring plan of OA was not comparable tothat of a private undertaking as regards staffmanagement. Furthermore, the Commission took intoaccount that Article 4(4) of Law 2271/94 re-qualified inpractice OA and its subsidiaries as a public sectorcompany for the purpose of recruitment of staff. (57) In particular, as far as the system of recruitment isconcerned, the Commission took note in its 1998decision of the provisions of Law 2190/94 concerningthe public undertakings and undertakings of public lawbelonging to the public sector. The only exemptions areprovided in article 14(2)(j) of that Law concerning OApilots. (58) Furthermore, the Commission stated in that decision(point 66) that 'the cumbersome administrativeprocedure regarding permanent staff 'was not unsuitedto flexible personnel management as needs for suchpersonnel were usually planned in advance.' Theprovisions in question of Law 2271/94 have beensupplemented by Law 2602/98 on the completion of the implementation of the restructuring plan of OA. Article 3 paragraph 2 of this Law provides that allpersonnel (flying crew, technical, ground staff) are allsubmitted to the provisions of Law 21 90/94.'(59) Therefore, it appears that the flexibility previously existing for the recruitment of flying crew (and pilots)has been removed. Furthermore, it is not clear whetherthe provisions of Law 2527/97 , which, as stated in the 1 998 decision, provide for a specific recruitment procedure for OA's seasonal staff, have not beenimplicitly abrogated by the provisions of Law 2602/98. This appears to be the case as this latter Law does not exclude explicitly seasonal staff from the provisions ofLaw 21 90/94 concerning the public undertakings andundertakings of public law belonging to the publicsector, so as to further maintain the recruitmentflexibility for seasonal staff. (60) Additionally, it should be noted that OA's management is not subject to the provisions of Law 2190/94 as stipulated in Article 2 of Law 2608/98 containing OA'sstaff regulations (preamble, paragraph 3 thereof).However, as OA is a public utility company accordingto the provisions of Law 241 4/96 as is explained below,its management and in particular the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors, the DirectorGeneral, the general and legal Counsels are appointed by the State. These aspects bring OA's recruitmentconditions further afar form the private ordinary lawapplying to private or public limited companies. (61) Law 95/7 6. Article 3 paragraph 2 of the Law providesthat claims by the Bank of Greece against OA for loansgranted by the State to OA as from 1 January 1975 areto be considered as claims against the State, which canthereafter be offset against any claims by OA against theState. (62) Article 3 paragraph 3 of the Law provides, that allcontractual transactions entered into by OA for thetransfer of any assets, real estates or any other property of OA, in particular aircraft, aircraft engines, helicopters etc., as well as any other notary transactions are to befree of any notary or registration fees. Article 4paragraph 2 of the Law provides, that by act of the Cabinet of Ministers OA's shares can be transferred to the Hellenic Bank of Industrial Development (ETV A) incontravention of otherwise applicable Greek legislation.Article 4 paragraph 3 of the Law stipulates that OA issubject, in any event to the control and supervision ofthe Minister of Transport and Communications. Thescope of this provision is very broad and covers everyactivity or managerial aspect of OA. It constitutes oneof the most important differences between anundertaking such as OA and any other private or publiclimited entity. Article 4 paragraph 4 of the Lawprovides that any contractual transactions for the transfer of any assets or any other property of OA to any entity of private or public law) will be carried outfree of any taxation or any other fees or public levy.Article 6 paragraph 2 of the law stipulates that the mealallowance paid in cash to the personnel of OA working28.5.2003 L 132/1 1 Official Journal of the European Union ENat the airports does not constitute a part of its wage and thus is not subject to withholdings in favour of theSocial Security Fund or other pension schemes. Thisparticular aspect was also addressed in the complaintlodged by HACA with the Commission against the Greek State on 12 October 2000. Article 6 paragraph 3, last indent stipulates that any reevaluation of OA'sproperty and any resulting readjustments are exemptfrom any taxation or any other fee. (63) Law 241 4/96. This Law concerns the 'modernisation ofthe public undertakings and organisations and otherprovisions'. This Law includes OA and all its subsidiariesin the list of 'public undertakings' to which the law applies and qualifies as 'public utilities' ('DEKO' in Greek). Most of the companies subject to this law are already private limited companies. Those who are notmust be transformed to such company form as requiredby Article 2 of that Law. (64) However, the provisions of this law, which apply also to OA, clearly derogate from those applicable to ordinary private limited companies. DEKOs are considered to beundertakings offering services to the general interestand, therefore, the Greek Government's involvement inthe management and the overall operation of suchundertakings is more intensive. Furthermore, there is nostandard legal environment for DEKOs. Therefore thescope of intervention of the State can vary. (65) With the exception of Articles 14, 19 and 20, which are not applicable to OA, all other Articles of that Law (24total number of Articles) constitute significant deviations from the provisions of Law 2190/1920. On the one hand the Greek State, as sole shareholder of OA, may appoint and revoke OA's members of the Board of Directors at any time, as is the case of ordinaryprivate limited companies, where the Board is appointedby the General Assembly of the shareholders. On theother, according to the provisions for DEKOs the Statecan de facto intervene and OA has accordingly to followdifferent procedures for the appointment of themembers of its Board and their decision-makingprocedures. In particular, the Chief Executive Officer isappointed by the State as representative of the Government and may be at the same time the Chairman of the Board of the company. Also, DEKOs have, unlikeordinary private limited companies, an extra body, theDirectorate's Board, the main tasks of which, is to ensure that the company's policies are coordinated with State policies. Moreover, DEKOs (and therefore also OA)are given preferential access to state funded programmesfor projects with national, Community or internationalinterest.(66) The Commission considers that these measures specific to OA raise doubts as to their compatibility with theabovementioned commitment entered into by the GreekState. This is so in particular because Article 1(c) of the 1 994 decision referred to tax exoneration affecting the recapitalisation and the restructuring of OA as theyresulted directly from the restructuring plan. Inasmuchas they confer to OA exclusively specific financialbenefits they also constitute new aid. The measuresprovided for by Law 75/96 and 241 4/96 go beyond thisprovision of the 1994 decision. Also, they clearly showthat OA is still not given the status of an ordinaryprivate or public limited company against the provisionsof Article 1(a), (b) and (f) of the 1994 decision. 2.Initiate the procedure with regard to new illegal aid. (67) The Commission considers that the following measures, apart of being a possible violation of the priordecisions, seem particularly likely to constitute State aids: (a) Greece tolerance with the non-application of normal Commercial law rules to OA (Laws 21 90/1920, 2271/94, 2602/98, 95/7 6 and 241 4/96) (b) Greece tolerance with the default on or deferred payment of Social Security and Tax obligations by OA. (c) Greece tolerance with the default on or deferred payment of the different kind of airport charges. (d) The exemptions from taxes, notary or registration fees for OA transactions. (e) The possibility of offseting debts of the State and of OA, or between airports and OA, including the 'Spatosimo' tax, in a non-transparent way. (i) The fact that by Presidential Decree 138/97 OA is required to pay airport charges and is not exempt from any rentals or other fees and levies for the use of space at Greek airports, does notin itself mean that OA factually complies withits obligation to pay such charges, fees andL 132/12 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ENlevies. In fact, the Greek authorities accept in their submissions to the Commission regardingthe complaint by HACA that OA has been inarrears with payments and that it has indeedrequested that its debts be offset against itsclaims against Greece. (ii) The same argument applies to the offset of debts between OA and the Greek State, asimplemented by virtue of Law 2733/99. Itshould be stressed, that as such the offset ofdebt is not considered incompatible withArticles 87 - 89 of the Treaty. This particularmeasure, however, does not provide in an objective, relevant, transparent, neutral and non-discriminatory way the debt accrued oneach side. Therefore, serious doubts arise as tohow the amounts concerned by the offset havebeen calculated. For that reason serious doubtsexist about the compatibility of the calculationmethod and the amounts offset by Law2733/99, i.e. GRD 9 862 639 493 (EUR 28,9million) as outstanding amounts by31 December 1998, which appear also toinclude tax payable by OA for overduepayments for airport charges and space rentalsuntil 31 May 1 999. (iii) Furthermore, serious doubts exist about the payment conditions for the landing charges atAthens International Airport as well as for thepayment of the airport development tax 'Spatosimo'. Furthermore, the Commission is particularly concerned with the statement of the Greek authorities in their observations on the supplementary complaint, that OA has requestedthe offset of amounts of EUR 15 million due asSpatosimo, as well as of the amountsoutstanding for airport charges and space rentalsat other Greek airports. Given that OA is thebiggest operator at all Greek airports, default onpayment of such charges and rentals deprivesthese airports of significant revenue and createsimportant distortions of competition among theair carriers which use these airports. (iv) It appears that the Greek State tolerates that OA is in arrears in its payments of airport charges,taxes, rentals and other levies to the airport and to the Greek State itself, because it has not made full payment to OA of that compensation. Therefore, the state of payment by the Greek State of any amounts agreed and/or outstandingat this moment to OA for the loss of investmentat Hellinikon raises doubts as to the compatibility of such payment. In that context,particular consideration is given to what the Greek authorities assert in their observations on the supplementary complaint lodged by HACA. (f) The granting of the operation of the fuelling facility to an OA subsidiary without an open tender and thetariff conditions applied. With regard to the fuellingfacility two aspects raise concerns: OA is the largestshareholder of OFC (Olympic Fuel Company) (66 %); OFC was selected by the Greek State in the course of a tender procedure for the construction andoperation of the fuelling facility at AIA. There aresignificant discrepancies between the final cost asopposed to planned cost for that facility. Seriousdoubts arise on whether the amounts charged by OFC as fuelling fees to recoup this investment only reflect differences in the exchange rate or whetherthey also contain elements of State aid. (g) The granting of a loan of EUR 19,5 millions by a public commercial bank (Commercial Bank of Greece) to OA on the basis of an assignment fromOA to that bank of its claims against the Greek State for an amount of EUR 22 millions for unpaid tickets. (68) In the same opening of the procedure, the Commission issued an information injunction in application ofArticle 10 of Council Regulation (EC) 659/1999 of22 March 1 999 laying down detailed rules for theapplication of Article 93 of the EC Treaty ( 8) with regard to all the information necessary for the Commission to decide about the alleged violation of the commitments and conditions included in the 1998decision, about the implementation of the restructuring plan at the basis of such decision and about the alleged new unlawful aid referred to above. This informationshould include all the relevant elements and inparticular: (a) the audited financial accounts for the years 2000 and 2001; (b) the use of the loan guarantees provided for in the 1998 decision with regards to the purchase ofaircraft and with regards to the relocation of Olympic Airways to AIA; (8) OJ L 83, 27 .3.1999, p. 1.28.5.2003 L 132/13 Official Journal of the European Union EN(c) the State of all financial and operational leases for the aircraft operated by Olympic Airways and itssubsidiaries; (d) all information regarding the introduction of a yield management policy and programme; (e) all information regarding the State of relocation of all activities of Olympic Airways to AIA; (f) the reports on the implementation of the restructuring plan as due by March and October2000; (g) the State and details of payment by Olympic Airways of the 'Spatosimo' tax as well as of V ATconcerning the company and its subsidiaries, theairport charges at Hellinikon and AIA, all rentals, fees and levies payable to Hellinikon, AIA and all other Greek Airports since 1998 until today; (h) all information and particular all payment details and conditions regarding the loan guarantee of EUR 1 9,5 million extended in February 2002 by the Greek State (Commercial Bank of Greece) to OA to cover operational costs. (69) The Greek authorities replied on 1 1 April. Although the information sent was extremely dense, the auditedaccounts for 2000 and 2001 were still missing, as wellas the reports on the implementation of therestructuring plan as due by March and October 2000.In the same letter, Greece informed the Commissionthat a new process of privatisation of OA is triggered. 3.2. Information injunction (70) As a result a second information injunction was adopted by the Commission on 9 August 2002, it requestedfrom the Greece: (a) The information already requested in the decision of 6 March 2002: (i) the audited financial accounts for the years 2000 and 2001. (ii) Precise and quantitative information on the payment of the operating costs OlympicAirways did not met in 2001 ( 9) (further enlightening the charges for the year 2001 onthe one hand, and the charges for the previousyears on the other hand), as well as therepayment plan of those debts from 1 January2002. (b) The following additional information: (i) Precise and quantitative information on all the current debts in any financial institutions andothers, as well as the repayment plan of thedebts ( 10). (ii) Concrete economic data of Olympic Airways for the first six months of 2002, as well as anobjective analysis for the company to reachviability in 2002. This analysis shall becontrolled and certified by an independentexpert. (iii) The legislation modifying the Law 2414/96 and Articles 3 paragraph 2, 3 paragraph 3, 4paragraph 2 to 4, 6 paragraph 2, 6 paragraph 3of the Law 95/7 6, which would permit to Olympic Airways to act as an effective private limited company, independent from any otherState influence than this resulting from itsshareholder position. (71) By 1 October 2002, Greece sent a reply and asked the Commission to convene a meeting on this issue. However, the 2001 audited accounts were still missingfrom the information sent to the Commission. The2002 analysis certified by an independent expert haseventually been transmitted on 14 November 2002. 4.COMMENTS BY THE GREEK AUTHORITIES (72) The Commission would like to emphasise the fact that the information transmitted by Greece following theopening of the procedure and the two injunctions ofinformation, notably by letters of 1 1 April 2002 and1 October 2002, and by hand at the occasion of themeeting of 1 6 October, have been often late andincomplete. The situation according to the Greek authorities concerning first the abusive application of the aid granted in 1994 and 1998 and secondly the newillegal aid is as follows: (9) It concerns debts, which have to be paid to suppliers and other third parties (airport charges, social security etc.). (10) It concerns financial debts (banks) or possibly debts related to the financing of the fleet.L 132/14 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union EN1.Abusive application of aid granted in the 1994 and 1998 Commission Decisions (a)The non respect of the restructuring plan (73) The Greek authorities underlined that the 1 997 results exceeded the most pessimistic results. In addition, in1998, because of strikes, financial crisis, shortfall ofaircraft as well as significant personnel retirements, itwas not possible to achieve targets for the year,especially as far as productivity was concerned. Effortswere nevertheless undertaken (strict management,introduction of a Frequent Flyer Programm, progress inthe development of a Management Information System). On 18 November 1999 Speedwing presented a new restructuring Plan. However, due to the disagreementwith the expert appointed by the Commission, Deloitte& Touche, such a plan was never accepted. Aprivatisation process started in 2000. In parallel, themanagement of OA rationalised OA's operations(reduced capacity and costs etc.). (7 4) In the meeting held in Brussels on 1 6 October betweenDG Energy and Transport officials and the Greekauthorities, accompanied by OA representatives, it wasspecified that OA had made significant progress sincethe arrival of the new management, in summer 2000,in terms of reduction of costs, as well as efforts not tomaximise revenue. (75) By doing so the domestic market share of OlympicAirways in the first half of 2002 was 57 %, as against53 % in the same period of 2001. The internationalmarket share was 25,2 %, as against 22,6 % in 2001. The load factor indicator for the network as a whole rose to 63,7 % in the first half of 2002 from 60,84 % inthe same period of 2001. (7 6) On the economic side, and in spite of such progress, theGreek flag carrier still recorded losses. Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation of Assets (('Earnings BeforeInterest Taxes and Depreciation of Assets', hereinafter:EBITDA) amounted to a loss of EUR 132 million in 2000. Such results are due, according to OA to the change of management and the increase of USD andpetrol. In 2001 the EBITDA estimation is a loss EUR149 million (mainly due to the move to Spata, whichhas increased the operational landing costs by 1000 %). The first estimations for 2002 made by OA's management would show that the company would havea positive EBITDA of EUR 1 1 million. (77) Indeed the new Deloitte & Touche report submitted by Greece points out the recent achievements of the company in its operation and financial result. It states,nevertheless, that depending on the hypothises takeninto account, the EBITDA would however range fromEUR 10 to EUR 58 million, with a 'most likely' scenariobeing a loss, of EUR 39 million. The differences aremainly linked to variances in revenue estimations butalso, according to the report, to a negative impact ofstaff cost vs. Plan objectives up to EUR 7 ,4 million.Deloitte explains that this impact may be linked to thestill unsatisfactory staff productivity; indeed 'Staffproductivity, however, when compared to 2000productivity per ASK (Available seat-kilometres) has deteriorated by 5,7 %'. (78) Once all operational costs (i.e. depreciation of assets and interest charge) are included, the operating result 2002shown by OA's management would be a loss of EUR 41 million. The review made by Deloitte & Touche also gives a lower figure, with a loss ranging from EUR 63to EUR 1 1 1 million and a most likely scenario of EUR92 million. Although these estimates tend to show animprovement from the previous years operating results(2001: EUR 194 million and 2000: EUR 1 64 million),they remain in all cases negative. (79) In addition, the profit and loss accounts includeexceptional results of about EUR 60 million in 2002(EUR 57 million in 2001 and EUR 69 million in 2000),which would enable the company, according to itsprojection, to post a net profit in 2002 for EUR 18million. On the basis of the operating result reviewed byDeloitte, the net result would remain, according tomanagement expectations, a loss and could range fromEUR 3 to EUR 50 million and a most likely scenario ofEUR 31 million. OA informed the Commission thatthese incomes would come from the next sale of planes, Galileo Hellas, Olympic Catering etc. Such possible actions have not been quantified in the report of Deloitte and have only been mentioned as expectations from the management. On the other hand, theconsultant takes note of the possible necessity for OA tobuild up a provision, therefore an additionalexpenditure, of EUR 23,5 million in relation to fines28.5.2003 L 132/15 Official Journal of the European Union ENand surcharges for past-due payments indicated as pendent for settlement with the Greece. (80) On the balance sheet side, the company has a negative stockholders equity since end 2001 for EUR 136million. No comments on this side have been made byDeloitte in their new report. (81) In the light of such late achievements, the Hellenicauthorities consider that they have made progresstowards the restructuring of the company. Hence, the Commission should not assess a formalistic attachment to a plan. (82) As far as the absence of reporting for March and October 2000 is concerned, the Greek authorities considered that they could have only been able to senda report on the basis of the Speedwing report. Given,however, that it became apparent that the results of theplan up to the summer 2000 were not satisfactory against the time frame of the restructuring of OA (non achievement of revenue targets, costs increase), Greecetook the view that a realistic assessment of the situationof the airline (i.e. the PriceWaterhouseCoopers report)had to be made before the adoption of a decision for itsrestructuring. Greece considered therefore appropriateto inform the Commission once such assessment andverification of the situation had been achieved. (83) To conclude, Greece insist in their comments of 21 November 2002, that the restructuring process has beenimpeded by 'insurmontable obstacles': First, OA hasalways operated under a situation of unrest due to theseveral changes of management; second, norestructuring Plan has ever had the chance of being fullyimplemented; third, the authorised aid has been delayedby the Commission. In particular the payment of thelast tranche of GRD 7 ,8 billion (EUR 22,9 million) hasnot been authorised, preventing the restructuring effort to bear its fruits; fourth and final point, a number of critical external factors (i.e. September 1 1th, Relocationto AIA, aviation market downturn etc.) have negativelyaffected OA's performance. (b) The non-respect of the conditions and commitments of the previous decisions (84) Article 1(d) of the 1998 decision regarding the MIS system. The Greek authorities argue that by imposing the 1 December 1 998 deadline to implement the MIS,the 1 998 Decision actually required OA to put in placesuch a system within four months. This requirement isconsidered unrealistic for a company, which had to implement such a system from the start. (85) Article 1(a) of the 1998 decision requires Greece to fulfil the undertakings referred to in Article 1(a) to (u) of the 1994 decision. In general Greece considers thatall these conditions were fully complied with in thecontext of the 1 998 decision. Indeed, they were aprerequisite for the adoption of the said decision.Hence, the application of normal commercial law to OA was one of the basic issues at stake for the 1998 Decision. As far as OA's articles of association areconcerned they have been published in the Government Gazette 451 8 of 15 June 2000. Concerning Article 47 of Law 21 90/1920 Greece draws the attention of the Commission to the fact that as sole shareholder it could not have been able to convene a meeting for thedissolution of the company. Instead, it has decided toprivatise the company, taking also into account the factthat the last instalment of GRD 7 ,8 billion of the capitalinjection had not been released. The delay for presentingthe 1999 accounts are due to the fact that OA neededto have a sound basis for future decisions and could notrely on best estimates any longer. 1 999 was chosen toconstitute such a basis. Nevertheless, Greece insists thatsufficient financial information was available to themanagement well before the audit of accounts. (86) As for the legal and fiscal status, Greece maintains that Law 2271/94 has been repealed or modified inaccordance with Commission suggestions, as theadoption of the 1 998 Decision was conditional on thisaspect. Besides, the provisions of Law 2602/98 have notabrogated Law 2527/97 , providing for a specific suigeneris recruitment procedure for OA. The former,adopted in March 1 998, has been carefully examined bythe Commission before the adoption of the 1998Decision and was accepted. The same explanationapplies to Law 241 4/96 of which most aspects havebeen implicitly repealed by Article 1 of Law 2602/98 before the adoption of the 1998 Decision. The application of Law 241 4/96 to OA was formallyrepealed following the adoption of the InterministerialDecision for the privatisation of the company. Law2602/98 was a precondition for the adoption of the1 998 Decision, it is, according to the Greek authorities,in full compliance with the requirement of the 1994and 1 998 Decisions to enact legislation necessary forthe implementation of the Plan. (87) Concerning Law 95/7 6, the Greek authorities stress that Article 1 of the 1 994 Decision required the HellenicRepublic to repeal Article 6 in so far as it concerned the extension of guarantees for the loans contracted by Olympic Airlines. The Greek authorities were not required to repeal the second paragraph of this article,this explains why such a request was not formulated forinstance during the opening of the investigationL 132/1 6 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ENprocedure in 1996. In substance, Law 2602/1998 (Article 1(3)) repealed food allowance for the entireflying crew and reduced it to 10 % of the gross monthlysalary for the rest of OA's employees. Consequently, thesocial security contribution exemption corresponding tothis 10 % of monthly salary of ground staff isinsignificant. If the Commission still finds this Lawincompatible, it is up to the European institution topropose appropriate measures for its modification sinceLaw 96/75 pre-dates accession. (88) In general Greece considers that the 'mere fact thatdelays or deviation occurred during the implementationof a restructuring plan does not suffice in itself tocharacterise the aid granted as misused'. They considerthat those elements are not a proof of contravention of the decision. Moreover, an amendment to a restructuring plan is always possible. 2.The granting of new illegal aid (89) A. The State tolerance with the non-application of normal Commercial law rules to OA. The Greek authorities categorically deny such allegation. They considered that the measures involved in this case should not be considered as State aid measures, but canonly be assessed in the context of an examination ofcompliance with conditions. As such, there is no causallink between the delay of publication of 1 999 OAaccounts and the ability of the company to survive since1999. With regard to the alleged support to OA viadefaulted or deferred payments, the Greek authoritiesrefers to the poor functioning of Greek administration,which is not in possession of modern and efficientresources and infrastructure. However, both the law andthe administration practice are applicable in a generalfashion and do not discriminate in favour of OA. (90) The Magefesa case is not applicable in the present case, as the Greek authorities consider they have used allavailable legal measures to ensure payments of theamounts due. Such a treatment of OA did not providefor any discrimination since it is identical to what happens in every similar case. OA competitors also have outstanding debts to the State (~ GRD 1,5 billion) andsome of them intend to settle due outstanding debts toAIA exactly the same way OA has. Even in the case ofan extremely limited number of legal provisions whichstill apply to OA there is no pecuniary element of support to OA and thus no State aid within themeaning of Article 87 of the EC Treaty. As for OA'scompetitors, Greece fails to see why their financialdifficulties should be attributed to the Greek State, as forinstance in the case of Axon, it ceased operation solelyon business grounds. Its shareholders did not want toaccumulate losses in this difficult period of time for theair industry. Moreover, in its comments of 21November, Greece insists that the plaintiffs areinsignificant players compared to OA and they are notin real competition with OA. It also considers that nodistortion of competition is imputable to OA as it haslost almost 40 % of its market share since 1 998. Greece considers that future relationship of OA with the State has now been rationalised. The Secretary General ofMinistry of Economy and Finance has already issued adecision that payments of air tickets in the future willbe effected as per market practices (i.e. cash). In thisregard, OA also issued an internal document to all OADepartments which prohibits the issuance of tickets toState employees on credit. (91) B. The Member State tolerance with the default on or deferred payment of Social Security and Tax obligations by OA; Concerning delayed OA payments of socialsecurity contributions for its employees for the periodMarch to December 2000, a settlement with IKA hasbeen concluded in accordance with applicable Greeklegislation. Following the signing of the settlement, OAis obliged to pay all new debts in time, if not alloutstanding settled amounts will become immediatelydue again. In their reply of February and October 2001 Concerning the alleged non payment of V AT on fuel byOlympic Aviation, the Greek authorities reassessed, while giving supporting evidence (V AT statements) that OA buys fuel for it and Olympic Aviation, which in returns then pays the V AT to OA. Concerning thenon-payment of 8 % V AT on domestic fares (journeys toislands), when OA operates flights between a certain number of Islands, it pays a reduced V AT (the 8 % V AT rate is reduced by 30 % provided OA maintainsbranches at these locations). The Greek authorities arguethat this is a 'insignificant fraction of the total salesvolume' that is why they have not explained the V ATsituation as regards the flights to the concerned islands,in their reply of 24 October 2001. The Greekauthorities acknowledge, however, that such a situation(passengers on these flights seem to be charged anamount up to EUR 3 per flight, which is paid to theState) is not consistent with the applicable legislation,but that it does not constitute State Aid. (92) C. The State tolerance with the default on or deferred payment of the different kind of airport charges. Greece28.5.2003 L 132/17 Official Journal of the European Union ENstated that the overdue payments have been organised via offset, in a transparent manner and that there is nodiscrepancy of data. Concerning the non-payment ofrental fees for the use of different facilities (ex-UShangar) at Hellinikon, the Presidential Decree 138/97imposes on OA to pay airport charges. Such legislationdoes not provide for any exemption from any rentals orother fees levied for the use of space at Greek airports.In case of delays of payments by OA, the applicableprocedures are imposed (e.g imposition of interest). With regards to the allegation of OA's debts to AIA for unpaid charges (ca EUR 30 million), as the Spata airportoperates as a private undertaking, no State aid isinvolved. There has been indeed an accumulation of debts due to the moving to AIA, hence OA has increased its operating expenditure by 1000 %.However, the two companies, AIA and OA, havereached an agreement to settle all OA outstanding debts.Such an agreement will be forwarded to the Commission when signed. (93) Concerning the delays in paying rent of premises and landing charges to other Greek airports, it is stated that common Greek law applies in full should OA default itspayment obligations. The offset of payments betweendebts of OA to the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authorities(hereinafter referred to as HCAA) and debts of HCAAtowards OA (ca. approximately GRD 750 million) areongoing, Greece promised to provide the Commissionwith an update within one month, as from 1 1 April. Asregards the non-payment of Spatosimo, the Greekauthorities insist that in case of defaults OA paysinterests and fines. In the present situation OA has topay fine and interest for GRD 5,1 billion (EUR 15million) for a total unpaid Spatosimo of GRD 2,2billion. Currently, OA has contested the payment of afine of EUR 15 million, the Administrative Courts haveupheld the action and ordered the suspensions of theHCAA decisions and Tax assessment. Finally no outstanding debt exists between Olympic Airlines and Olympic catering, except for normal commercial debt. (94) In general the Greek authorities contest the allegationthat it tolerates absence or default of payments by OAand that it does not impose interests on deferredpayments or fines. It considers that its replies of19 February and 24 October 2001, as well as Annexes 19 to 21 of that memorandum demonstrate that OA is treated as any other Greek Company. OA has requestedthe payment of delayed State debts in order to improveits cash-flow position during the 2002 winter season,which is always a difficult season, (and all the moreafter 1 1 September). Besides, for the unpaid amounts by OA, Greece has initiated applicable procedures for the recovery of amounts due. (95) D. The exemptions from taxes, notary or registration fees for OA transactions. The Greek authorities affirmthat OA does not enjoy such exemption. Legislation hasbeen enacted to implicitly repeal Articles 3(2), 3(3), 4(2),4(4) and 6(3) of Law 96/75. (96) E. The possibility of off-seting debts of the State and of OA, or between airports and OA, including the 'Spatosimo' tax, in a non-transparent way. The Greekauthorities consider the off-setting debts system istransparent. (97) The totality of last years' defaulted payments of OA to the Greek State (including Spatosimo) have been verifiedas debt to the State in accordance with common Greeklaw and has been forwarded for payment arrangements (including all corresponding interest and fines due. This is common procedure and is applied also to otherairlines. As soon as OA is in default of payment, theapplicable procedures for recovery are applied. Theoutstanding OA claim of GRD 1 9 billion forcompensation for its forced early eviction fromHellinikon is still a pending issue and thus cannot beoffset against OA debts to the State by virtue of Greeklaw, such offsets can be effected only against certifiedclaims towards the State). Finally, as for the argumentthat airports are deprived from important revenuesbecause of the delayed or non payment by OA (themain contributor) and that this affects competition, the Greek authorities replied that airports in Greece are not autonomous but are funded by the State budget, allincome derived goes to State budget, hence there is nodistortion of competition. (98) F. The granting of the operation of the fuelling facility to an OA subsidiary without an open tender and the tariff conditions applied; there was an internationaltender run by Spata airport in 1 997 and not by the Greek government. On the basis of clearly stated assessment criteria OFC was chosen. The entireL 132/18 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ENdevelopment costs amount to approximately GRD 1 4 billion, while the expenses on a 12-month basis arebudgeted by OFC at approximately GRD 600 million. (99) The hydrant fee charged by OFC to airlines for the storage and distribution of aviation fuel amounts to4,36 US cents/Ugallon at the EUR/USD exchange rate ofApril 2002 and allows, according to Greece, for therecovery of the annual operating expenses, the loanamortisation and a contained return on the investor'sequity at an annual rate of well below 15 %. At anestimated projected fuel consumption growth of 2 % peryear, the current value of OFC's charges over the21-year operating period amount to approximately GRD30 billion according to the Greek authorities, as opposed to the Commission estimation of GRD 100 billion. Finally, Greece stated that OA has decided tojoin OFC in order to make sure, as it is the biggest userof the airport, that the fee would not rise significantlyand that it would not be controlled by petroleumcompanies and refineries solely. (100) G. The granting of a loan of EUR 1 9,5 million by a public commercial bank (Commercial Bank of Greece) to OA on the basis of an assignment from OA to thatbank of its claims against the Greek State for an amountof EUR 22 million for unpaid tickets. The CommercialBank of Greece ((CBG) is not part of the public sector),10 % is acquired by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Caisse Nationale. OA needed such a loan to face likely problems of cash-flow for winter 2002, which is always a verydifficult season. The loan was granted by CBG againstcertified claim of OA towards the State for unpaid air tickets amounting to EUR 22 million. This is not a State Guarantee. Besides, the loan has been granted at worst market condition than if it had been covered by a Stateguarantee: EURIBOR + 1,25 %. 5.OA's situation as of November 2002 (101) Before engaging in the assessment of the abusive application of the previous aid and the alleged new aid,it is necessary examine the current economical and financial situation. (102) The Commission would like to emphasise the fact that the examination of OA's present situation has only beenpossible after two injunctions of information. Thereplies however not only have they been late, forinstance the requested objective analysis on whether thecompany is going to reach viability as of 2002, was only remitted on 14 November 2002, but Greece never forwarded to the Commission the main information inrelation to audited accounts for 2001. 5.1. Abusive application of the aid granted in 1994 and 1998 5.1.1. The restructuring plan (103) The Commission insists on the fact that the analysis of OA's results and financial situation must be conducted bearing in mind that the reliable audited informationonly relates at the latest to the year 2000. For morerecent figures the Commission relies on the informationprovided by Greece, which does not consist of auditedaccount for 2001, and on estimations made by thecompany and subject to a limited review by anindependent consultant for 2002. (104) All figures reported in the text are rounded to theclosest million EUR or billion GRD. (105) The table shows key indicators of the 1998 decision accumulated by the Commission on the basis of theinformation provided by Greece. Some of the figures and ratios corresponding to those of 1998 can not be provided on the basis of the information available today.28.5.2003 L 132/19 Official Journal of the European Union ENFinancial Indicators (1)1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Plan Actual Plan Actual Plan Actual Plan Estimated Plan Projected Turnover Million GRD 324 234 269 519 329 071 273 602 344 829 283 083 359 057 \u2014 380 626 \u2014 Million Euros 951,5 791 965,7 802,9 1 01 1,9 830,8 1 053,7 7 61,8 1 1 17 802,8 Operating result after interest (2) Million GRD 1 4 610 - 10 362 21 294 - 1 6 832 9 622 - 55 651 1 644 \u2014 8 470 \u2014 Million Euros 42,3 - 30,4 62,5 - 24,9 - 41,7 Profit before tax (3) Million GRD 5 120 1 660 20 914 - 25 980 22 587 - 32 378 2 697 \u2014 6 590 \u2014 Million Euros 15 4,9 61,4 - 7 6 66,3 - 95 7 ,9 ,3 19,3 2,22 N/A Total number of aircrafts (5) 3 53 33 73 34 03 24 03 24 02 6 (1) Actual figures 1998 to 2000 taken from OA's balance sheets; estimations for 2001 and projections for 2002 from draft figures submitted by the Greek au thorities.

(5) Figures-other than plan - do not include the aircrafts of the subsidiaries. 1 EUR= 340,75 GRD (106) It can be seen that serious difficulties arose in the implementation of the plan as early as 1998. In 1997operating result after interest amounted to a loss of GRD - 28 billion (~EUR - 82 million) against an intended profit of GRD ~1,7 billion (~EUR 5 million).Despite austerity measures undertaken in 1998 tocounterbalance this development, the objectives set bythe plan for 1998 were not be achieved. The operatingloss after interest the company experienced in 1998amounted to GRD - 10,4 billion (EUR - 30,4 million)against an intended profit of GRD 14,6 billion (EUR42,3 million). (107) The restructuring plan foresaw over its whole period a significant increase in turnover: in 2002, the turnovershould have reached GRD 380 billion (EUR 1 17 million)compared to GRD 275 billion in 1 997 (+ 38 %).Between 1998 and 2002 the turnover remained in factin the range of GRD 270 to 283 billion (EUR 792 to831 million) bearing in mind that 2001 itself was anoverall difficult year for the air industry. (108) The operating result was intended to be positive already in 1 998. The restructuring plan forecasted a drop to analmost breakeven level for 2001 before a return to more positive results in 2002. In reality the operating loss (i.e.after all operative expenditures including depreciation ofassets and interest cost on financing, but beforeexceptional items) remained ca. GRD - 10/- 17 billion(EUR - 30/- 49 million) in 1 998-1999, it increased to GRD - 55/- 66 billion (EUR - 1 63/- 194 million) respectively in 2000 and 2001 and is estimated to beEUR - 41 million (GRD - 14 billion) in 2002. (109) If the 2002 estimated figure of EUR 1 1 million EBITDArepresent an improvement compared with the last twoyears, which had negative figures, this result can only beconfirmed in actual figures when the 2002 accountswill be audited. It is, however, very unlikely that OA willachieve this result, as confirmedby the reportcommissioned by the Greek authorities fromDeloitte ( 11). (1 10) In that respect it must be pointed out that the level ofperformance to which the Greek authorities refer as (11) See paragraph 75 and followings.L 132/20 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ENOperating profit in their reply to the Commission of 1 October 2002 cannot be considered as such. It is also not the definition used for the same heading in theDecision of 1998 and in the spreadsheet included andreproduced above. Therefore, the claim that thecompany has now achieved a positive operating profit isnot valid, since such profit actually corresponds to theso-called EBITDA. Indeed, the EBITDA has to cover, notonly the normal profitability for the shareholders \u2014which is not even envisaged here \u2014 but also two majorcosts components for all companies: \u2014 the depreciation of fixed assets represents, in the accounting form, the decrease of value, linked to theuse, of assets invested in the activity of thecompany, here mainly the aircrafts and otherair-related fixtures, or in other terms theiramortisation over their expected lifetime. Thisheading plays also a key role for the futurefinancing of new assets to replace the existing ones and to ensure the long-term running of the company; \u2014 the interest charge paid by the company to its banks and other financial institutions providing funding toits activity and/or investments. (1 1 1) Therefore, it must be emphasised that such a low level of EBITDA remains unsustainable. On the basis of OA'sfigures as forwarded to the Commission thedepreciation of fixed assets and the interest charge willtogether amount to an estimated EUR 52 million.Deducting this amount from the EBITDA would bringthe operating result or EBT ('Earnings before taxes' ( 12) of 2002 to a loss of more than EUR - 41 million and toa most likely case of EUR - 92 million as per Deloittereview. (1 12) However, Greece insists, in their reply of 21 November,that according to the Deloitte & Touche reportindications, the application of International AccountingStandards (IAS) instead of the Greek ones, would havesignificantly improved the EBITDA. It must beunderlined, nevertheless, that this only constitutes aclassification issue as the use of IAS, i.e. in the presentcase accounting the leases as economic purchases of theassets, would transfer part of the costs from thefinancial to the depreciation charge. The Deloitte & Touche report, accordingly, makes clear that it does 'not believe that this change would significantly affect theoverall results of OA', i.e. the operating profit on whichthe analysis of the Commission is based since 1994.(1 13) According to Greek information an important amountof exceptional gains seems to have been generated since2000 and would have reduced these losses. Indeed, theiramount is very significant (EUR 68 million in 2000, EUR 57 million estimated for 2001 and EUR 60 million forecasted for 2002). For the years 2000 and 2001 theymainly consist of the compensation received from theState for moving from Hellinikon airport to AIA Spata(EUR 51 million in 2000 and EUR 65 million in 2001).In addition there has been the sale of a building (EUR22 million in 2000). In 2002 exceptional gains areintended to consist of a last instalment of thecompensation for moving to AIA Spata of EUR 6million as well as of gains from the sale of tangiblefixed assets \u2014 such as aircraft of up to EUR 1 6 million\u2014 and financial fixed assets such as shares inparticipation of up to EUR 25 million. These gains,which may partially be linked to disposals of non-coreassets, may indeed help easing the financial situation ofthe company. They remain nevertheless a one shotoperation, which has no consequences on the cost structure of the company, which remains worrying. It must be emphasised that only operating profit may inthe long run allow the survival of an undertaking. (1 14) The information provided also refers to an exceptional income for 2002 of EUR 5 million relating to thecompensation offered by Greece to all Greek airlinesfollowing the events of 1 1 September 2001 and theclosure of airspace. This aid scheme has been registeredby the Commission under the number NN 1 19/2002and is still under scrutiny by its services under the Stateaid rules. The present decision will not prejudge theoutcome of this examination. (1 15) For 2002, the last information provided on 1 6 October2002 by OA's management and the Greek authoritieswould be that in addition to these EUR 60 millionexceptional item, an additional EUR 1 12 million ofexceptional income is awaited. No formal evidence onthe content of such item was communicated, however,the OA's management broadly explained that it couldcorrespond up to EUR 37 million to the sale of thecompany's shares in the catering and reservation's systems activities. The remaining and major part (EUR 75 million) is described as sale and lease-back ofairplanes. The magnitude of this alleged profit incomparison with the underlying value of these assets inthe last balance sheet of the company per 31 December (12) And also before exceptional items.28.5.2003 L 132/21 Official Journal of the European Union EN2000 (Gross book value of EUR ~155 million and Net book value - after depreciation - of EUR ~41 million),as well as the poor level of second-hand aircraft's sellingprices at the moment, when many of them are alreadygrounded awaiting a buyer or lessor, can not lead the Commission, until final proof, to consider these figures as reliable. (1 1 6) Due to the company continuing making high losses theequity situation, the increasing debts and the gearingstatus (total payables of the company divided by equity)remain that of a company in difficulty. \u2014 The negative gap of shareholders equity (plan vs. actual) has increased from GRD 32 billion (EUR 93million) in 1 997 , to GRD 37 billion (EUR 108million) in 1998, to GRD 85 billion (EUR 249million) in 1999 and finally arrives at GRD 132 billion (EUR 387 million) in 2000. For that year own funds were almost nil (GRD 645 million or lessthan EUR 2 million). Based on the non-auditedfigures communicated to the Commission for 2001own funds further decreased to EUR - 136 million. \u2014 Following the various figures for 2002 ( 13) mentioned above and depending of the level ofexceptional income effectively achieved, own fundsas of 31 December 2002 may range between EUR- 209 million and EUR - 6 million and with a 'mostlikely case' as described by Deloitte of EUR - 139million. Even in the most favourable assessment ofthe effect of exceptional income on the company'sfinancial situation, the shareholders equity will inany event remain negative during the final period ofthe restructuring plan. \u2014 This level of shareholders equity is exceptionally uncommon for a company still active. The auditedaccounts confirm that the red line of 50 % loss ofthe share capital has been crossed in 1999.Normally such a situation triggers immediatereaction by the shareholders, which may constitute in an increase in share capital and/or in putting intoaction severe restructuring measures in relation tothe cost structure, which may lead to adapting thecompany's activities. There has been no suchreaction of Greece, neither by increasing the sharecapital nor by undertaking important adaptations tothe restructuring plan in time. \u2014 In view of this situation the company relies since the end of 2000 only on borrowed money tofinance its activities. In 2001 the need for externalfunds financed by the banks and other third parties,trading partners, suppliers as well as Stateauthorities, through additional loans or by grantingdelays in payment has increased even more. Indeedthese borrowings finance not only the whole assetsof the company but also the negative shareholdersequity of EUR 136 million. \u2014 The debt has notably increased in 2000 and in 2001. Financial debt increased in 2000 by approx. GRD 15 billion (EUR ~ 44 million) and thus multiplied by 4 compared to 1 999. In addition,liabilities towards suppliers also increased by GRD ~1 1 billion (EUR ~ 32 million), whereas liabilities inrelation to taxes and social security were GRD ~ 1 1billion higher than in 1 999. In both cases the 2000figures doubled the amounts shown for 1 999. Suchimportant increases in debt can not be justified bythe company's development of activities i.e.turnover, which remained more or less stable, andwhich could have generated higher costs forpurchases, salaries, etc. if it had itself increasedsignificantly. The debt situation relates in fact to OA's overall financial situation and the company's lack of means to meet its current financial obligations in relation to third parties. \u2014 According to OA's audited figures current liabilities ( 14) in total increased from GRD 39 billion (EUR 1 1 6 million) in 1999 to GRD 86 billion (EUR252 million) in 2000. In 2001 the long-term debtincreased by EUR 187 million due to the loanguaranteed by the State financing the relocationcosts in connection with the OA's move to AIASpata. (13) See paragraph 78: net result could amount par management estimations to + EUR 18 million and following Deloitte analysis tolosses from \u2014 EUR 3 million to \u2014 EUR 50 million. Possible additional exceptional income of EUR 1 12 million and charge of EUR 23 million could also arise. (14) Caption Liabilities C 2 of OA's balance sheet.L 132/22 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union EN\u2014 In 2001 current liabilities to third parties increased by another EUR 90 million from EUR 252 millionin 2000 to EUR 342 million estimated for 2001. They almost tripled in comparison with 1999. Figures show that OA debts in relation to socialsecurity payments rose from EUR 19 million in1 999 to EUR 29 million in 2000 and almost EUR44 million at the end of 2001. Between the end of1 999 and 2001, OA's debts relating to taxes havebeen multiplied by 10 (EUR 10 million in 1999,EUR 33 million in 2000 and EUR 99 million in2001). Once again such an increase may not bejustified by changes in the company's activitiescausing higher debts. In relation to the factual situation of OA on the contrary, current assets, which are normally financed by current liabilities asdescribed above, slightly decreased from EUR 313million in 2000 to EUR 301 million as of thenon-audited 2001 figures, thus normally reducingthe need for financing. The acute need for cash tocompensate recent losses is the only justification forthe described development. \u2014 The gearing is one indicator provided by the 1 998 decision intended to monitor the implementation ofthe restructuring plan. This ratio is to be calculatedas the total of all debts owed by the companydivided by the shareholders equity ( 15). Depending on investment and operating results of each year, itwas expected to remain between 2.22 and 2.7 6, inthe worse for year 2000. In fact, after a positivestart in 1 998 (2.01 instead of 2.22), the weight ofthe debts combined with poor operating resultsbrought the actual figures to 3.87 in 1999. At the end of 2000, when the equity had almost vanished, debts represented 303 times the equity and thegearing arrived at 303. \u2014 Today the ratio can not be calculated any more due to the negative level of the equity. It is a furtherelement proving that OA is a company in financialdifficulties far away from any possibility to achieveviability independent from outside intervention. Agearing ratio of 2.7 6 (highest ration allowed for2000 by the 1998 restructuring plan) put in relationto the 2000 and 2001 total debt level ( 16) requests a net equity of OA representing of at least EUR 200to 300 million, in case exceptional gains foreseenfor 2002 can be realised. The only way to achievean increase in equity in the company's presentfinancial situation is through an equivalent cashinjection in capital by shareholders. To compensatethe current negative equity in 2001 the necessarycapital injection would rather amount to EUR 340to 450 million. \u2014 The above figures represent the minimum necessary capital injections supposing that as of 2003 OA willremain at least breakeven. Under the condition thatall conditions and obligations laid down by thepresent restructuring plan authorised by the Commission 1998 are met, OA may still receive a last instalment of EUR 23 million (GRD 7 ,8 billion) foreseen therein. Not only the conditions andobligations have not been at least partially met, butalso the amount of the last instalment of the 1998restructuring aid of EUR 23 million (GRD 7 ,8billion) is far from corresponding to theabove-described minimum need for a capitalinjection meeting paying off the current debts of OA. (1 17) Conclusion : Greece stated to the Commission its commitment to implement the 1 994 and 1 998restructuring plans. Most of the targets requested thereinhave not been achieved. In addition the conditions andobligations requested by the plans have not or notcorrectly been implemented. The company continues tobe in serious financial difficulties. OA's describedfinancial situation and the serious difficulties identifiedlead to a lack of viability in the short as well as in the long term. 5.1.2. The implementation of a Management Information System 'MIS' (1 18) In relation to the effectiveness of the information systemput in place by OA in September 1999 Alan Stratfordand Associates, the independent experts investigating it,stated that: 'the consultants are satisfied thatmanagement will receive valid and reliable information,but only provided that data is input according to thedefined timetables'. The information system should havebeen put in place at the latest in December 1 998, asrequested by the Commission's 1 998 decision.

There were two further potentialweaknesses of the system identified by the consultant,which relate to the fact that the MIS is not applied to allsubsidiaries of OA (for example; Olympic Aviation) andthat certain key management information is not yetincluded, which seriously reduces the management'sability to obtain a true overview of the whole of theiraviation business. (1 1 9) According to the information submitted on 1 1 April2002, Greece argued that the deadline of 31 December1998 has been unrealistic as it would have meant toimplement a MIS within four months. Greece alsosubmitted to the Commission the MIS currently applicable to OA as Annex 39 to the mentioned information, stating that it has been completed in October 2000 and been applied since. (120) According to Annex 39 the MIS is not applied to any of the subsidiaries and in particular neither to Olympic Aviation nor to Macedonian Airlines, which bothoperate air transport services. The Commission is not inpossession of any evidence confirming that the systemhas been successfully implemented and whether it everbecame a 'fully operational and adequate managementinformation system' as requested by the Commissiondecision of 1998. From the information provided (page4 of Annex 39) it shows that the system has not beenmade accessible as would be necessary for fullimplementation. Limited access has been granted as of October 2000. The actual application of the information system is not being proven by any of the informationavailable to the Commission nor are any results thereofreflected in the data transferred to the Commission. (121) The most significant evidence that the MIS is not operational is provided by the official auditors of OA(SOL SA - Certified auditors) in the audit reports forthe years 1 998, 1 999 and 2000, and by the enormousdelay it took to have the accounts audited. (122) It must be reminded that audit reports can generally bebroken up into three major categories. The mostfavourable situation, and by far the most frequent one, relates to reports issued without any remarks, the so called 'clean opinions', showing no restriction in theopinion of the auditors and therefore fully ensuring atrue and fair view of the accounts of the company. Onthe opposite side, there can be a refusal of certificationin very severe cases or suspected frauds. In between, one finds the grey zone of the so-called 'qualifiedopinions' where the auditors accept the accounts underthe condition that they also mention their reservationsor qualifications in the same report. Hereby it has to benoted that certain qualifications are in some casesunavoidable, for instance, for a first audit year or whenbig changes in the accounting policy occur. Thisremains, however, the exception and does not relate tothe present case. A qualified opinion, with the exceptionof the mentioned specific situations, is always a negativeoccurrence for a company, which the management willalways try to avoid by persuading their auditors to lifttheir reservations. A qualified opinion has always an impact on the company's situation vis-\u00e0-vis its clients, suppliers and credit institutions. (123) OA last audited reports relating to 1998, 1 999 and 2000 were all subject to a qualified opinion referring infinancial terms to very serious issues, which may bemainly qualified as follows: (124) Qualifications made on the basis of the audit process, its scope and restrictions. In relation to year 1 998 auditorsstate that 'Until today (note: 10 September 1999) wehave not received a satisfactory number of confirmationletters for liabilities and receivables in concern'. Inrelation to 1 999 it was written that 'the balances ofcertain receivable and liability accounts have not beenfully investigated, for which due to discrepancies, crosschecking, lack of data etc., provisions ( ...) have been set up against the results'. They also refer to 'The delay incompleting the closing entries of the Balance Sheet andthe events affected significantly in the uniformapplication of the inventory method among the years '.In 2000 it is stated in relation with the overdue drawingup of the accounts that 'the aforementioned delayrestricted our ability of applying basic auditing procedures (physical counts, verification and reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents, inventoriesand other assets).' (125) The Commission understands from the above that the auditors, in order to be able to release a non-negativeopinion, had to remind the public to which the reporthas been addressed that the work and assessmentusually required by the rules of the profession could notbe fully performed as the relevant evidence was notavailable. Indeed, an audit assignment never undertakesa 100 % check, it however requests compliance with normal auditing standards required by both national legislation and rules as well as International standards ofauditing, to which auditors make reference at thebeginning of each report. In OA's case the remarksmentioned in their report are designed to show thatL 132/24 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ENcompliance with normal audit standards could not be assured. (126) Qualifications linked to the accounting, management and internal control status. For the year 1998, auditorsmentioned the following: 'Generally speaking the systemof the book-keeping for the income and the wholeaccounting system has to be improved in order toensure the full compliance with Accounting standardsand principles'. In 1 999, they went one step further bystating that 'The incomplete following up system of therevenue and the presented weaknesses in the accountingorganisation along with the inefficiency of internalcontrol, entail immediate measures to be taken in order to eliminate these significant weaknesses'. In relation to 2000, the criticisms in the same field became not onlymore precise, but also harsher: 'The incompleteapplication of the revenue Information System thatresulted in deficient application and monitoring of therevenue, receivables and payables cycle, as well as thesignificant deficiencies in the company's accountinginfrastructure, combined with the absence of internalcontrol, entail immediate action to be taken in order toeliminate these significant weaknesses'. (127) It is obvious from the successive reports that theauditors, not only were not satisfied with and confidentin the Information System of OA, but moreover hadgrowing concerns over the years. Indeed, where, in1998, the report mentions the need for improvement ofthe revenue and accounting system, the 1999 reportstresses the need to take measures against weaknesses, on the revenue side, as well as in relation to internal control qualified as deficient. In 2000, the auditors hadan even more devastating opinion. Not only the revenuecycle but also the whole key aspects of the relationswith third parties (including customers and suppliers)were reported as weak and needing immediate action.As far as the internal control is concerned, thejudgement is more than clear: from inefficient in 1999,in 2000 full absence is being reported. (128) As a consequence, the Commission may not concludethat a Management Information System has beenimplemented. The auditors, who are mostly involved inits control, have so acutely described its downtrend overthe years and thus providing little comfort for themanagement to monitor their actions and to all thirdparties to gain confidence in the company's performance. In addition is the recent outsourcing of the Revenue system a further evidence of the poor pastperformance of the company in this respect. It appearsto be linked not only to efforts in relation tocost-reduction but to the complete lack of internalorganisation in this respect and, especially in terms of time-table. (129) The delay in producing final accounts confirms the overall negative trend mentioned in the auditors'reports. (130) The Commission notes that during the restructuring period audited financial accounts of OA have neverbeen presented in time. According to Greek law, inparticular Article 43 paragraph 5 of Law 21 90/1920,the managing board of a private limited company has to publish the financial statements of the company for the previous financial year at least 20 days before thegeneral meeting of shareholders. Such a meeting has tobe convened six months after the end of each financialyear. Moreover, Articles 3 and 5 paragraph 6 ofRegulation (EEC) No 2407/92 require an air carrier 'toprovide its licensing authority every financial year,without undue delay the audited accounts relating to theprevious financial year'. Since 1998, however, OlympicAirways has been unable to present final auditedaccounts in due time: \u2014 the 1 998 accounts have been finalised, as shown by the audit's report, on 10 September 1999, more orless eight and a half months after the closure of thefinancial year. This was already late compared to thelegal deadline in Greece, as well as per Europeancommon practice, which are six months after theclosure of the year; \u2014 for the 1 999 accounts, the report was issued on 1 1 December 2001, almost two full years after theclosing and more than five months after thedeadline of those for 2000; \u2014 as a consequence, the report on 2000 accounts was issued on 1 August 2002, still 17 months after theclosing and again after the deadline for the 2001accounts; \u2014 as far as the 2001 accounts are concerned no audit accounts were supplied to the Commission and it istherefore more than doubtful that such accountsexist. The best estimate of OA management, givenorally in the meeting of 1 6 October 2002, would bea signature of the accounts early 2003, which wouldbe still one year after the closing of the financialyear and at least six months out of schedule. (131) Once more the problem relating to the production of audited accounts has not decreased but worsened or at least remained at a disturbing level as shown above. The Greek authorities consider that the last reduction in the delays, prove that the situation is improving. In fact the28.5.2003 L 132/25 Official Journal of the European Union ENCommission would like, on the contrary, to emphasise the degradation occurred between 1998 and followingyears. Should the reduction of delay improve further,one can only hope, but without any certitude, to have2002 or possibly 2003 accounts on time. (132) These accumulated delays create further difficulties as the management may not rely on properly auditedaccounts for their daily business. In addition, neither theshareholder nor third parties ever gain a proper viewand security over the company's performance andresults. The delays in relation with the qualifiedopinions raised by the auditors may only lead to greatersuspicion regarding the reliability of the accounts andany data related to it. The conclusions drawn up byDeloitte & Touch in their reports to the Commission ( 17) on 1998 and 1999 going into the same direction prevail. Greece has not informed the Commission of any action able to comfort the situation in the future. (133) In view of the above relying on non-audited data for2001, although necessary to obtain a final picture, hasto be undertaken with great caution. During recentyears significant differences are traceable between thecompany's last announced figures and those finallyshowed by annual audited accounts. In their assessmentof the 1997 figures, the expert appointed by the Commission, Deloitte & Touche, reported a change from a net profit of GRD 15 billion to a loss of GRD - 7billion between the last forecast and the final figure. (134) More recently Greece reported by 1 1 April 2002 (18)a net loss estimated at GRD ~ - 26 billion (EUR ~ - 7 6,3million) for the year 2000. This figure, althoughprovided more than 12 months after the closure of thefinancial year, had then to be changed to a loss of GRD- 32,4 billion (EUR - 95 million) in the auditedaccounts signed on 1 August 2002. This incident confirms the persistence of the lack of reliability of the non-audited figures presented. (135) Finally, in relation to the implementation of a reliablemanagement information system applying to theholding OA, the auditors have mentioned in theirreports on 1 999 and 2000 that, despite obligation under Greek law and in infringement to the Seventh Council Directive 83/349/EEC of 13 June 1 983 based on the Article 54 (3)(g) of the Treaty on consolidatedaccounts ( 19), lastly amended by Directive 2001/65/CE of the European Parlament and the Council (20), the company has not prepared consolidated accounts for itsgroup. In addition to what constitutes a breach of law,such behaviour, in the context of the growing role ofthe two major subsidiaries, Olympic Aviation andMacedonia Airlines (in the overall network and airtransport activities of OA) represents a lack ofinformation for all parties, the management, theshareholder and the engaged third parties, including the Commission, to gain a proper vision of OA's group activity, results and financing flows. (136) Even the newest piece of information, the reportsubmitted by Greece on 14 November 2002, and veryrecently prepared by Deloitte & Touche confirmed theabsence of reliable data at OA. The consultant stated 'Aswe have noted in previous reports, Management Information relies on manual systems that are, in some cases, unreliable or inconsistent.' (137) Conclusion : No reliable MIS is in place in relation to OA and its subsidiaries. Apart from confirmation to thisrespect offered by the Greece no respective prove hasbeen granted to the Commission. OA management isstill unable to rely on valid data or to produce reliable figures. Surveying the effects of the restructuring plan authorised by the Commission in 1998 is thereforeunachievable. 5.1.3. The specificity of OA status (138) Greece has informed the Commission that the legislation at stake (Laws 2271/94, 2602/98, 2527/97 and2414/96) does not contravene Article 1(a) of the 1998decision (Article 1 commitments (a), (b), (c) and (f) ofthe 1994 decision), as it has been examined, verifiedand accepted by the Commission within the proceedingleading to the adoption of the 1998 decision. The Commission acknowledges that such legislation in the contest of the 1 998 decision was indeed acceptable. (139) However, as far as Law 95/7 6 is concerned, the Greek authorities indicated their readiness to redress the (17) Pages 55 and 56 of the draft report of 3 July 1998 and page 7 4 of the report of 21 July 1999. (18) Appendix 2 of the Greek memorandum forwarded on 1 1 April 2002.(19) OJ L 193, 18.7 .1983, p. 1. (20) OJ L 283, 27 .10.2001, p. 28.L 132/26 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ENsituation created by the provisions of this Law in favour of OA. The Greek authorities do not refute the doubtsexpressed by the Commission as to its compatibility. Given that the law in question has entered into force before the date of accession of Greece into the Community (1 January 1 981), it appears necessary to redress the situation by requiring appropriate measureswhich would consist in the simple abrogation of therelevant provisions of that law, i.e. Article 3 paragraph2 and paragraph 3, Article 4 paragraph 2, paragraph 3and paragraph 4 and Article 6 paragraph 2. (140) The Commission takes note of the fact that OA's articles of association have been published. (141) Concerning the financial accounts, the Greek authorities argue that there is no link between the delay ofpublication of the financial audited accounts and theability of the company to survive. The Commissionacknowledges the absence of such a link strictu sensu. However, it observes that by accepting that the audited financial accounts are never produced in time (on thecontrary delays increase), Greece accepts that OA clearlyinfringes Community and national Greek law, it alsoshows that the MIS has not been implemented as askedin the 1998 Decision. 5.2. The new illegal aids 5.2.1. The granting of EUR 19,5 million loan (142) OA has been granted on 8 February 2002 a loan by a public commercial bank (Commercial Bank of Greece)to OA on the basis of an assignment from OA to thatbank of its claims against the Greek State for an amountof EUR 22 million for unpaid tickets. The loan has to berepaid within one year. The repayment interest of theloan shall be equal to the Euribor rate + 1,25 %. If thereis default for late payment, late payment interest will bedue with penalty interest of 2 % above the repaymentinterest. According to the submission of Greece (Annex10) since the mutual settlement of debt between the Greek State and OA (and Olympic Aviation) in December 1998, the accrued debt of the Greek Statetowards OA amounted as of 31 December 2001 to GRD14 844 375 105 (ca. EUR 43 563 830), out of which GRD 12 71 1 47 4 679 (ca. EUR 37 304 401) were overdue amounts of unpaid tickets. This piece of evidence appears to be in line with the amount of EUR22 million which has been recognised by Greece as debttowards OA and which has been ceded to CommercialBank of Greece to secure its loan for EUR 19,5 million.5.2.2. Greece tolerance with the default or deferred payment or any other advantageoustreatment under Greek fiscal and commerciallaw (143) The Greek authorities submitted as annex IX of their reply of 1 October 2002 an extract (Article 22) of Greek Law 2731/1999 of 5 July 1999 on cooperation and development regarding non-governmentalorganisations and other issues. Therein it is referredimplicitly to OA. The relevant provision states thatwhere a decision is taken in accordance with Article 2of Greek Law 2000/91 regarding company privatisation,the provisions of Greek Law on DEKOs (companies thatqualify as 'public utility undertakings') 2414/96regarding the modernisation of public undertakings andorganisations and other provisions, will not beapplicable except from Articles 9 and 10 of that law. These concern the procedure to be followed in the case of privatisation (Article 9) and the percentage of the capital of the companies' under privatisation, which hasto remain always Greek (at least 51 %). (144) Hence it appears that OA is no longer a DEKO. This has been confirmed by the Greek authorities in their submission of 1 October 2002 (point 5) stating that OAwas not subject to the provisions of Greek Law 2414/96on DEKOs, as of June 1999, when the Greek Stateconferred the management of OA to Speedwing. (145) Application of Article 2 of Greek Law 2000/1991requires a decision to privatise a company, which hasbeen until then subject to the provisions of Greek Law2414/96 regarding DEKOs. In their correspondence of26 August 1 999, the Greek authorities referred to the OA's new managers without however indicating any privatisation procedure. It was only on 13 December1 999 that the Greek State took the decision to privatise OA, a procedure, which was launched on 20 December 2000 and declared unsuccessful in February 2002.However, the Greek authorities never notified the Commission about the actual change of status of the company. (146) Taking into account the fact that OA is no longer a DEKO and hence OA is not subject to the provisions of Greek Law 2414/96 since June 1999 (or even December 1 999) but only to the general provisions of Greek Law2190/1 920 regarding public limited companies, certainprovisions of Greek Laws 2271/94 and 2602/98 shouldhave been adapted accordingly as they do constitute a separate legal frame for the recruitment and staff regulations of OA's employees. The Commissionobserves that OA, while being a normal public limitedcompany continues, however, to be subject to theDEKO's legislation.28.5.2003 L 132/27 Official Journal of the European Union EN(147) With regard to the payment of social security obligations, according to the submission of Greece (as communicated in Annex 53 section 15 and 1 6, as wellas Annexes 31 and 32 of the 1 1 April 2002 reply) amounts have been due to the Greek State by OA in form of social security payments since 1 993 until 2001.During this period of eight years when OA has not paidthese charges, no actions in the form of fines, auctionsetc as foreseen in the applicable Law ( 21) have been undertaken by the Social Security Institution ('IKA'). InApril 2001 OA benefited from a settlement with IKAfor amounts due up to EUR 32 million. Accrued interestbrought outstanding payments to a grand total of EUR45 million. The amount was payable in 24 monthlyinstalments plus one bulk advance payment (2instalments). The monthly rate of the settlement was setat EUR 1 7 60 821. The monthly rates of contributionsfor the ongoing monthly due payment vary, but are ca. GRD 2,235 billion, i.e. ca. EUR 6 559 060. The legal basis for that settlement was Greek Law 267 6/1999,which allows for such settlement under the condition, that no payment after the date of settlement is unpaid and overdue. Otherwise the entire settlement collapses.Also, according to that law, OA had the possibility tosuspend overdue payments for 3 months after a periodof six months of payments after the settlements wasagreed. However, that should have not affected OA'smonthly due payments. (148) In order to secure payment of its claim IKA proceeded in July 2001 to an execution on immovables of OA for the amount of EUR 21 218 264. However, there is noevidence of any further action against OA's property tosecure this payment. OA appears to have paid effectivelyafter the settlement agreement only until September2001. For the months of October \u2014 December 2001 itbenefited from the provision of the above mentionedLaw regarding a three-month suspension of payments ofthe amounts concerned by the settlement. However, OAdoes not appear to have made any payments to IKA forany social security contributions due during thesemonths. (149) Therefore, not only OA has not paid its social security contribution during eight years, without incurring anypunitive action, but it has also not observed the latesettlement, which should have collapsed uponnon-payment of the settlement instalment of one month(October 2001). Against the amount of EUR 45 million,payment has been effected for 6 months in 2001 plusthe advance payment. January and February 2002appear to have been paid. Thus paid amounts are EUR 1 7 608 210. (150) With regard to the non-payment of V AT on fuel and spare parts by Olympic Aviation, after examination ofAnnexes 28 and 29 to the 1 1 April Memorandum, thereis no evidence that Olympic Aviation has paid theconcerned V AT to the fiscal authorities from January toMay 2001, and from November to December 2001. (151) Concerning t he possibility of offseting debts of the State and of OA, or between Airports and OA, including the 'Spatosimo' tax, in a non-transparent way,the Commission has raised the issue of the vagueness of the Greek Law 2733/1999 as to the calculation of debt mutually owed and settled as per that law. Greece in itssubmission of 1 1 April 2002 presented the offsetagreement between the Greek State and OA of 24 June1 999, it gives a breakdown of the amounts due andunpaid on each side. The amount offset was GRD9 862 639 493 (ca. EUR 28,9 million). (152) OA's outstanding payments to the Greek State represent airport charges for domestic and international flights forthe period November 1 994 until December 1998 aswell as 'rentals'. The documentation submitted ( 22) fully covers the airport charges. There is, however, no details(only a total amount) regarding the 'rentals' that concernthe period 1 996 to 1 998 only. Thus, the amount of GRD 509 192 802 (ca. EUR 1 494 330) are unidentified. (153) It should also be noted that the Greek State'soutstanding obligations towards OA do not cover aparticular period of time. Therefore, it is not possible toverify the validity of the submission. In particular, theoffset agreement refers, under point 2 (a) of Annex 15to the Memorandum of 1 1 April, that GRD3 402 729 422 (ca. EUR 9 986 000) represent amountsdue for unpaid tickets of officials of the HCAA,maintenance of aircraft used to transport officials by theHCAA, utility costs of buildings of the HCAA. Abreakdown of these costs in an annex to that agreementwhich forms integral part of it indicates that these costsamount only to GRD 2 443 981 910 (ca. EUR7 1 72 361). There is no explanation on the differencebetween the two figures. According to point 2 (b) of theoffset agreement the amount of GRD 6 459 910 071 (ca. (21) Greek Law 2238/1 994, in particular Article 95 and encyclia of IKA No 42/1999 for the settlement of obligations. (22) In the Annex 15.L 132/28 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ENEUR 1 8 957 317) i.e. the rest of the amount offset, represented obligations of various Ministries and publicservice organisations towards OA. Here too, there is noreference to which period of time these obligationscorrespond. Also, Greece does not provide any evidencefor the amounts presented neither tickets, nor invoices. (154) Concerning the period 1 998 to 2001 no offset betweenOA and Greece has been forwarded. Instead, theCommission notices that rentals for different airports for the period 1998 to 2001 are due up to an amount ofEUR 2,46 million (EUR 1,6 million for OA and EUR860 000 for Olympic Aviation). No evidence ofpayment has been communicated. (155) Regarding the imposition of the airport development tax 'Spatosimo', according to the submission of 1 1 April2002 ( 23) it appears that no evidence of payment has been adduced for the total amount of ca. EUR60 999 156 as Spatosimo tax for the period ofDecember 2000 to February 2002 as well as for themonth of March 1999. The complementary documentssent on 1 4 November 2002, specifies that anoutstanding debt of EUR 31 million would be settled inaccordance with applicable law and procedure.However, no proof of payment, nor details on the period and the airports concerned are provided. (156) With regard to the payment of the Airport charges to AIA, Greece in its submission of 1 1 April 2002 (in particular Annex 44) states that airport charges and any other levies and fees (including rentals and payments for utilities) have been duly made and that there is thereforeno issue of state aid. Examination of the materialsubmitted by Greece reveals that according to Annex 44costs and payments incurred between March 2001 (startof activity at the new airport) until February 2002, arereported at EUR 24 million. OA and AIA had reachedan agreement on 23 April 2002 to settle OAoutstanding debt. The Commission has received copy ofthe final agreement dated 23 April 2002 on 14November 2002. This document assesses the debt toEUR 33,92 million for the period March 2001 to March2002. Debts should be reimbursed with 12 quarterlyinstalments for 3 years, beginning in July 2002. Theinterest rate for the repayment are based on Euriborrate + 2,5 %, which is actually high. OA has secured thisthree-year settlement by conceding all anticipated PublicService Obligations revenue to AIA throughout this period and by granting a first rate mortgage on a737-400 fully-owned aircraft. However, no proof of anypayment made in that respect has been communicatedmeanwhile. (157) The exemptions from taxes, notary or registration fees for OA transactions. These exemptions are linked withLaw 95/7 6 and should be treated in the context of theappropriate measures to be adopted. (158) With regard to the non-payment of V AT at 8 % collected by OA on domestic fares. Greece in its submission of 1 1April 2002 ascertain that the reduced V AT is to be paidby OA and Olympic aviation 'only for flights betweenthe islands of Lesbos, Hios, Samos, Dodekanesse, as Thasos, Samothraki, Northern Sporades and Skyros, providedthat it maintains branches at these locations. Throughthe documentation received, the Commission has been able to verify that the amounts were in fact paid by OA to the State as they are charged on the passenger ticket.' (159) Concerning the outstanding debt to Olympic Catering, the Commission has been presented with theinformation that OA has a normal commercial debt ofEUR 2,43 million. (1 60) As far as the compensation for the early eviction from Hellinikon and the relocation to Spata, the amount seton April 1999 and agreed by the Commission inDecember 1 999 was GRD 33,66 billion (EUR 98,8million). An additional GRD 8,7 billion (EUR 25,6million) has been determined by an independent reviewin February 2002 and is linked to disturbances becauseof OA's forced early eviction. It brought thecompensation due to EUR 124,4 million. As a whole,Deloitte mentions that OA has received EUR 138,7million in compensation. This amount, when taking intoaccount the inflation and interest impacts, is close tothe one established. OA, however, requests up to GRD1 9 billion (~ EUR 55 million) to settle all its claims arising from the move from Hellinikon but this amount is not at the time recognised by Greece. Therefore,considering the documents analysed, the Commissioncan be satisfied that there is no overcompensation of OA for such a move. (23) In Annexes 41-44.28.5.2003 L 132/29 Official Journal of the European Union EN5.2.3. The granting of the operation of the fuelling facility to an OA subsidiary (1 61) The Greek authorities have stated that the granting of the fuelling facility has been undertaken through aninternational open tender launched by AIA in 1997 . Theinitial cost for the construction and operation of thefuelling facility by OFC was set at GRD 9,6 billion (ca.EUR 28,3 million), and the contract was awarded to OFC for 23 years according to Greece. OA is OFC's largest shareholder with 66 %. According to Annex 24of their submission of 1 1 April 2002, the Greekauthorities submit as part of a fuelling concession, theagreement of 13 August 1998 between the AIA and Olympic Airways, Avinoil, Motor Oil Hellas, BFSC and Hansaconsult for the construction, commissioning,operation and maintenance of an aviation fuel distribution system at AIA. (1 62) They have also communicated an amendment agreement No 2 of 22 May 2001 relating to that fuelling concession agreement between AIA and the OFC SA providing for amendment of the initial agreement to implement the maximum agreedconstruction cost. The fuelling concession agreementdoes not contain any reference as to the initial cost ofthe investment as well as how the throughput fee wouldbe applied given that it clearly states in point 1 6.4 ofthat agreement that: 'Subject to the foregoing [the fuelling concessionaire \u2014 OFC SA \u2014 shall implement a charging policy (including without limitation, in respect of thethroughput fee) which is fair, objective, transparentand non-discriminatory between users and whichdoes not discriminate on the grounds of the volumeof frequency of aviation fuel supplied or therelationship between the user and the Fuelling Concessionaire or any connected persons with the fuelling concessionaire] the fuelling concessionairemay charge through put fees lower than thosecalculated in accordance with annex M but in nocircumstance shall it charge at a higher level.' (1 63) It should be noted that there is no evidence submittedas to the actual fuelling throughput fees charged to OAand its subsidiaries, or to its competitors by OFC SA. The part of the fuelling concession agreement submitted as Annex 24 does not contain any reference to the costof the facility at the moment of the conclusion of the fuelling concession agreement (Annex C which has not been forwarded). It must be borne in mind that the costof the construction of the fuelling facility is the basis forthe calculation of the base rent and the throughput fee.As per amendment agreement No 2 to the fuellingconcession agreement the cost of the facility increased and reached the amount of GRD 14,030 billion (EUR41,175 million). Therein it also mentioned that thefuelling concessionaire would need additional financingof an amount of GRD 1 381 47 6 238 (ca. EUR 4,054million). It is not explained what the relationshipbetween the initial financing requirements of the facilityis, neither how additional finance may be achieved, norhow the additional costs would be amortised throughfuelling charges or State subsidy. 6.ASSESSMENT OF THE AID (1 64) Under the terms of Article 87(1) of the Treaty and Article 61(2) of the EEA Agreement, any aid granted bya Member State or through State resources in any formwhatsoever which distorts competition by favouringcertain undertakings or the production of certain goodsis incompatible with the common market and with theEEA Agreement. The measures to be assessed are: (a) The aid granted to OA, initially authorised by the Commission's Decisions of 7 October 1 994 and of 14 August 1998, in relation to which the Commission decided to open the procedure provided for in Article 88(2) of the Treaty on 6March 2002, relating to the non-compliance with the restructuring plan as well as the non-compliance with commitments undertaken by Greece (will betreated in section 6.1). (b) The alleged non-notified new aid granted to OA in relation to which the Commission also decided on 6March 2002 to open the procedure provided for inArticle 88(2) of the Treaty, relating to the grantingof EUR 1 9,5 million, tolerance with default paymentor any other advantageous treatment under Greekfiscal and commercial law as well advantages inrelation to the operation of the fuelling facilities(will be treated in Section 6.2). 6.1. Assessment of the aid initially granted in the 1998 Decision, referred above under (a) 6.1.1. Existence of State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty (1 65) With regard to aid initially authorised the Commission already in the previous decisions of 1 994 and 1998L 132/30 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ENstated that it constitutes State aid and that it affects trade between Member States and also distortscompetition within the common market. In this respect,the Commission refers to its assessment set out in thosedecisions. 6.1.2. Legal basis for the assessment of compatibility (1 66) The Commission considers that the derogation provided by Article 87(2) of the Treaty and Article 61(2) of theEEA Agreement as well as Article 87(3)(b) of the Treatyand Article 61(3)(b) of the EEA Agreement do not applyin the case at hand. In this respect, the Commissionrefers to its assessment as set out in the previous twodecisions. (1 67) Article 87(3)(a) and (c) of the EC Treaty containderogation in respect of aid intended to promote theeconomic development of areas where the standard ofliving is abnormally low or where there is seriousunderemployment. Greece is a region falling entirely within the scope of Article 87(3)(a). (1 68) However, the regional needs in relation to Olympic Airways and aviation services in general, are taken intoaccount thorough public service obligations imposed by Greece to companies offering services between theGreek mainland and the islands as well as between islands. When offering such services Olympic Airways,like all other airlines, is subject to these obligations andbenefits, as the case may be, from compensation inrelation to non-viable routes. In particular cases, theairlines in question may operate under exclusive rightsgranted in accordance with Article 4 of CouncilRegulation (EC) No 2408/1992 ( 24). In a liberalised market services necessary to achieve economic and social cohesion as well as regional development may beoffered by any operator. In addition, the Commissionconsiders that the objectives of regional aid arenormally met more easily through aid schemes, whichensure the supply of such services by a variety ofoperators. (1 69) The aid under examination is a clear-cut restructuring aid granted to a company in financial difficulties sincealmost 10 years, a situation which has not considerablyimproved. Not only has the restructuring aid notachieved the envisaged results, but moreover has theauthorisation by the Commission for State aid grantedto rectify the financial difficulties of the company been abused. The Commission does not see any justificationto consider the aid assessed by this decision as helpingto achieve any regional development purposes andtherefore regards the aid as not eligible to anyexemptions with regional objectives. (170) With regard to the derogation provided by Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty in respect of aid to facilitate thedevelopment of certain economic activities where suchaid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest, the Commission also refers to its initial decisions whereby it considered that the restructuring aid of the companywas considered compatible with the common marketunder proviso of respect of the conditions. 6.1.3. Appraisal of the compatibility of the aid granted in the 1994 and 1998 CommissionDecisions (171) In its 1998 decision, Commission considered that thecompatibility of the aid with the common market wassubject to the full implementation of the restructuringplan aimed at the restoration of the viability of the Company, to the respect by Greece of 24 specific conditions attached to the authorisation of the aid; theavoidance of undue distortions of competition and that the aid was to be limited to the exact minimum. The compatibility of the aid being subject to specificcommitments, the Commission by the following has toassess the impact of the breach of certain of thesecommitments. 6.1.3.1. The full implementation of the plan (172) As early as 1 999, the Commission had informed Greece that it could not authorise the grant of the remaininginstalment of GRD 7 ,8 billion, as the achievement of theexpected results in particular as regards costs andproductivity ratios had not been achieved. On 26August 1999, Greece, while stating its commitment tothe 1 998 restructuring plan, accepted that it would haveto be further revised to achieve the targeted results.From mid-1999 onwards, however, the 1998restructuring plan had been unilaterally changed by OA and Greece for a new restructuring plan, established by Speedwing and mainly focusing on expansion ratherthat cost containment, and which, as such, could nothave been accepted by the Commission. Moreover, (24) OJ L 240, 24.8.1992, p. 8.28.5.2003 L 132/31 Official Journal of the European Union ENSpeedwing had initiated its implementation in August 1999, even before the plan was submitted to the Commission on 18 November 1 999. During the period August 1 999 - Summer 2000 i.e. management periodof Speedwing, the restructuring efforts and objectiveswere suspended. After the departure of Speedwing anew phase of cost containment started with the arrivalof a new management. Meanwhile, the company hadlost 50 % of it share capital. (173) The Commission is forced, therefore, to construe that the reduction of costs, which had been identified as akey element of the restructuring plan of 1998 ( 25) together with the improvement in yields, was not considered as such any longer by OA management and the Greek authorities. Moreover, the continuing lossesby the company and the decreasing level of theshareholder equity have kept OA has a firm in difficulty. This should have triggered an immediate reaction byGreece, the sole shareholder, in order to redress the situation, either by increasing the share capital or byundertaking important adaptations to the restructuringplan in time. None was done. Indeed, Greece couldhave, during the rest of the restructuring period, hadpresented changes to the restructuring plan and even tothe amount of the aid according to the Communityguidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuringfirms in difficulty ( 26). However, it has not done so, although Greece has repeated at several occasions that 'aformalistic attachment' to the restructuring plan couldnot serve as a reference any longer. The Commission, therefore, can only assess the full implementation of the plan on the basis of the restructuring plan of the 1998decision. (17 4) The Commission accordingly observes that the plan, object of its decision, was not fully implemented anylonger. Moreover, the appointment and then departureof Speedwing management, created a stop and go effectbetween cost reduction phases (1 998 - early 1 999) andexpansion phases (late 1 999 - early 2000). Such asituation could only be seen as counterproductive by alllayers of the company staff and could create frustration,impression of lack of direction and of support by theState, thus creating an additional difficulty to restore OAsituation. It is interesting to note in this respect, that Greece itself in its comments of 21 November 2002 acknowledges that these changes have created a situation of unrest in the company. (175) The Commission could certainly welcome the move made mid-2000 by the Greek authorities, after thedeparture of Speedwing, to try to renew with the application of the plan. However, in addition to thenegative effects of this new stop and go movementimposed again to the company, such a move arose oneand a half year before the deadline of the restructuringplan, thus giving little time to the company to restartand achieve the plan. In that respect, the Commissionconsiders that the behaviour of OA's variousmanagement, as tolerated or even generated by theState, sole shareholder of the company, and as aconsequence the Greek State, have not shown aconstant, effective and willing attitude to put in placethe plan presented for approval to the Commission. (17 6) The argument put forward by the Greek authorities that the non payment of the last tranche of the capitalinjection (EUR 22,9 million) has further aggravated thefinancial situation of the company and hence weakenedits restructuring effort, can hardly be accepted. Greeceacknowledged as early as 1998, that the implementation of the 1 998 to 2002 Plan would have to be further revised for the Commission to consider positively thegranting of the last instalment. Besides, as explained insection 5.1.1 EUR 23 million are far fromcorresponding to the minimum need of capital injectionnecessary to restore the equity of OA. (177) Also, the Commission could hardly verify, not being inpossession of the audited accounts for 2001, what thereal impact of the 1 1 of September events have had on OA financial situation. It appears, nevertheless, that irrespective of these implications and irrespective of thecompensation already received by OA and currentlybeing examined by the Commission, the non respect ofthe restructuring plan can be identified as early as 1999and confirmed in the following years. (178) The fact that OA has not put in place a MIS has also prevented the company to implement the plan, as itlacked an appropriate monitoring tool and a properaccounting system. (179) As a consequence, since the plan was not effectivelyimplemented, the objectives initially set have never beenmet. Indeed, all indicators as reviewed in point 5.1.1.depart significantly from the ones set in the 1 998decision. (180) Finally, in order for the Commission to fully monitorthe progress of the restructuring plan, it needed detailedand regular reports. The Commission opposes the Greek(25) Indeed, seven major actions were described under the heading \u2014 reorganisation of the cost structure of the company \u2014 in the1998 decision. ( 26) OJ C 288, 9.10.1999, p. 2.L 132/32 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ENstatement that reports transmitted in various forms, gave the necessary information that should have beensupplied through the March and October 2000 reports. The information received, sporadic and heterogeneous, could have not allowed the Commission to clearlymonitor the progress of the restructuring plan,according to the indicators set in the 1 998 Decision. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that the table in point 5.1.1 as per today, cannot be fully completed. (181) Conclusion : Bearing in mind all abovementioned financial elements, it is the view of the Commission that OA hasnot implemented the restructuring plan as accepted bythe Commission in its 1 998 Decision and has been,since 1999, a firm in difficulty according to thedefinition of the Guidelines on State aid for rescuingand restructuring firms in difficulty ( 27). This has been acknowledged by the Greek authorities, which in contradiction with their constant statement to respectthe restructuring plan admitted in their comments of 21November 2002 that no Restructuring plan has everhad the chance of being fully implemented. Consideringthis deviation from the results foreseen in the plan, thelack of a timely reaction by the Greek authorities, whichwere aware of the situation, can also be seen as aviolation of the original decision. The Commissionconsiders that the non respect of the restructuring planalone would be enough evidence to justify theconclusion that previous aid has not been respected. The Commission will nevertheless also assess the impact of the breach of the other conditions. The restoration of the viability (182) A restructuring plan, the duration of which must be as short as possible, must, according to the Communityguidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuringfirms in difficulty, lead to the long term viability of thefirm within a reasonable time-scale and on the basis ofrealistic assumptions as to the future operatingconditions. (183) As early as 1994, the Commission considered in itsdecision that OA's recapitalisation and restructuringplan could enable the company to create an operationof lasting viability within three years without receivingfurther aid. Due, however, to the difficulties met and following the wish of the Greek authorities, an updated plan was submitted and approved by the Commission in1998. As a consequence, the restructuring period hasbeen extended to 2002.(184) However, since the restructuring plan has not beenrespected, as a consequence the long term viability ofthe company, primary goal of the Commission decision,has never been achieved, neither for the long term, nor even for the short term. This is clearly demonstrated by the total financial collapse of the company, which hasno own funds, only debts. Under any usual commercialpractice, OA should have been forced to file forbankruptcy by any associated third parties. Hence, evenif the Commission was to assess OA financial situation,irrespective of the full implementation of the 1 998restructuring plan, as repeatedly requested by the Greekauthorities, the viability of the company would be veryunlikely to be established. (185) It must also be reminded that the auditors, in theirreport for the year 2000, had mentioned that theircertification was made 'under the strict assumption thatthe company continues its activities as a going concern'. This statement is quite unusual in an audit report and shows that the viability of OA was already questionableand that other options, such as liquidation, which wouldhave led to another balance-sheet, could have beenconsidered. 6.1.3.2. The respect of the 24 specific conditions Article 1(d) of the 1998 decision required OA to put in place a MIS by December 1 998 (186) Greece informed the Commission that such a system is in place as from October 2000. It can therefore beaffirmed that a MIS was not put in place in time asrequired by the decision. However, considering theamount of time necessary to have such a systemworking effectively, the Commission can accept Greecearguments that 4 months to implement the system werenot sufficient. (187) However, the Commission considers that today there isno evidence submitted to substantiate theimplementation of the requirement of the decision for afully operational and adequate system to allow OA tomonitor the results of the restructuring plan. On the contrary, OA has met huge delays to have its annual accounts approved. All audit reports includequalification that testify the lack of reliable accounts andof internal control, as well as the deficient applicationand monitoring of the revenue, receivables and payables (27) Paragraph (5)(a) of section 2.1 specifies that a firm is in difficulty in the case of a limited company, where more than half of its registered capital has disappeared and more than one quarter of that capital has been lost over the preceding 12 months.28.5.2003 L 132/33 Official Journal of the European Union ENcycle. There has been no improvements in this respect over the last three years. In several instances, OA had tocontract external experts to assess its financial situation(PriceWaterhouseCooper), since it was unable tomonitor the restructuring plan and hence its normalday-to-day activity. Finally, Deloitte & Touche, theconsultant appointed by OA, confirmed in 2002 theunreliability of the MIS. (188) Besides, the MIS should have allowed the Greekauthorities to amend the restructuring plan on the basisof monitoring. Such amendment was never done,although the Greek authorities on 1 6 October 2002accepted that the restructuring plan was not respected. (189) Conclusion : The Commission concludes that Greece has not respected the condition of Article 1 (d) of the 1 998decision to put in place a fully operational and adequateMIS. Article 1(a) of the 1 998 decision required Greece to fulfil the undertakings referred to in Article 1(a) to (u) of the 1994decision (190) According to the 1 994 decision (28), from a management and status point of view, OA would havethe fiscal status of a public limited company comparableto that of Greek undertakings under ordinary law in Greece, except, however, for exonerating OA from any taxes likely to affect the recapitalisation operations envisaged in the undertaking's '1994' recapitalisationand restructuring plan communicated to the Commission. Also Greece would not interfere in accordance with the 1994 decision ( 29), in the management of OA except within the strict limits of itsrole as a shareholder. Finally in order to respect Article1 commitment (f) of the 1994 decision, Greece wouldhave adopted immediately the legislation necessary forthe effective implementation of the salary, social andfinancial aspects of the plan. (191) The Commission takes note that OA's articles of association are published and hence that the obligationsof transparency of Law 21 90/1920 are respected. (192) The Commission considers that the clarifications transmitted by the Greek authorities give the insurancethat Laws 2271/94, 2602/98, 2527/97 and 241 4/96 donot contravene the above three commitments (c), (b) and (f) in this respect. (193) As to the commitments for which no breach by Greecewas identified (Article 1(d) and (g) to (u) the informationavailable to the Commission demonstrates that Greecehas not failed to comply with these commitments. (194) As far as Law 95/7 6 is concerned, the Greek authoritiesindicated their readiness to redress the situation createdby the provisions of this Law in favour of OA. The Greek authorities do not refute the doubts expressed by the Commission as to its compatibility. Given that thelaw in question has entered into force before the date ofaccession of Greece into the Community (1 January1 981), the Commission reserves the possibility ofproposing appropriate measures in a separateprocedure. (195) However, Greece by tolerating that OA never publishesits audited financial accounts in time and never appliespenalties clearly accepts infringement of Greek Law2190/1 920 and Community Law (EC Regulation (EC) No2407/92). By not imposing the remedies availableaccording to national law or by not withdrawing the aircarrier license, Greece clearly demonstrate that it allowsto prolong OA's activity after 2000, without furtherrestructuring measures, whereas a company applyingnormal Commercial activity should have stopped.Article 1(c) of the 1 994 decision is not respected. (196) Article 1(e) of the 1994 decision requires Greece not togrant OA any further aid. This has been clearlyinfringed, as it will be explained in section 6.2. 6.1.3.3. Conclusion (197) The Commission has authorised in 1994 to 1998 State Aid under the conditions, which were considered theminimum requirement necessary to accept the aid asnot distorting competition contrary to the commoninterest and therefore compatible with the EC Treaty. The Commission notes that Greece has granted the aid under modified conditions contrary to those underwhich the aid has been originally authorised in 1 994 to1 998 and concludes that the aid no longer complies with the authorisation and can therefore, not be considered compatible with the EC Treaty. It is recalledthat the second tranche of EUR 41 million of therestructuring aid authorised in August 1998 by the Commission, was paid in September 1998. (28) Article 1 commitment (c). (29) Article 1 commitment (b).L 132/34 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union EN6.2. Assessment of the alleged new aid, referred above under (b) 6.2.1. Existence of State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty with regards thealleged new aid 6.2.1.1. Alleged new aid related to the granting of EUR 19,5 million (198) The Commission has been able to verify that the loan of EUR 19,5 million has been granted according to marketconditions, the repayment interest of the loan is equalto the Euribor rate + 1,25 %. There is no advantagegranted to OA as the loan has been secured not againsta State guarantee, but on the basis of an assignmentfrom OA of its claims against the Greek State for an amount of EUR 22 million for unpaid tickets. The Commission has also been able to examine that this amount is in line with the total amounts declared by Greece as debts towards OA for unpaid tickets (total amount of approx. EUR 37 ,3 million. The Commissionconcludes to the non-existence of State aid as far as theEUR 19,5 million loan is concerned. 6.2.1.2. Alleged new aid concerning the tolerance with default payment or any other advantageous treatmentunder Greek fiscal and commercial law (199) With regard to the exemption from taxes, notary or registration fees for OA transactions, as it is linked toLaw 95/7 6, the Commission reserves the possibility ofproposing appropriate measures in a separateprocedure. (200) Concerning the non-payment of V AT at 8 % collected by OA on domestic fares and the compensation for the early eviction from Hellinikon and the relocation to Spata, the Commission has been able to verify that OAhas paid the former and that there is noover-compensation for the latter. The Commission canconclude that there is no State aid involved. (201) The Commission can also conclude that there is no State aid involved in OA's commercial debt of EUR 2,43million towards Olympic Catering, which represents anormal commercial liability. (202) The information received concerning the operation of the fuelling facilities does not allow the Commission toconclude to the existence of State aid.(203) With regard to OA fiscal and legal status, Greece has decided on its own initiative, without a specific requestby the Commission, to modify OA status in order tostart its privatisation. Greece has confirmed that as early as June 1999, OA was not subject to Law 241 4/96 on DEKOs, which had been accepted by the Commission inthe framework of the 1998 decision. However, sincethen, OA instead of being treated as any other Greekpublic limited company continues to benefit fromspecific legislation which is normally only applied toDEKOs and which had been accepted by the Commission in that context. This is an exceptional situation, which does not appear to be foreseen by the Greek law. (204) The Commission is, therefore, unable to verify that such a framework, which only applies to OA, does not entailpossible State intervention and hence possible distortionof competition. Moreover, the fact that OA is imposedspecific cumbersome legislation on the recruitment ofstaff cannot exclude the infringement of one of the 24conditions attached to the granting of the restructuringaid (Article 1(b) of the 1994 decision and Article 1(a) ofthe 1998 decision), where Greece would not interfere inthe management of OA except within the strict limits ofits role as a shareholder. Hence the situation seems to stem from an infringement of the Greek law, a misuse of the previous aid by the non-respect of the conditionsattached in the 1998 decision and the existence ofdistortion of competition. (205) Concerning the payment of social security obligations, before the conclusion of the settlement with the Organisation for Social Security (IKA), which Greece has not provided the Commission with yet, OA has not paidits contributions from 1 993 to 2001 (EUR 32 millions)without incurring any fines or penalty. Since thesignature for an amount of EUR 45 million of thatsettlement (accrued interest brought the outstandingpayments to that total) OA appears not to have paid October to December 2001, thus being in breach with the settlement. A private creditor, considering thefinancial situation of OA, would have immediately usedall legal means of action, including, if needed, legalmeans of execution to obtain the payment of the dueamounts as laid down in the settlement. The fact thatIKA has not undertaken such action constitutes Stateaid. Therefore, the amount of EUR 27 391 790 as partof the (collapsed) settlement is overdue and immediately payable. To that amount default interest should be accrued. (206) With regard to the non-payment of V AT on fuel and spare parts by Olympic Aviation, no evidence of payments from January to May and November to December 2001, have been provided. As the Commission has not received this information, it cannot exclude that it constitutes State aid. No proof ofpayment for the rentals for different airports for the28.5.2003 L 132/35 Official Journal of the European Union ENperiod 1 998 to 2001 to an amount of EUR 2,46 million has been given. A normal creditor, informed of OAfinancial difficulties, would have used, as a minimumfrom 1 999, all legal means of action, including, ifneeded, legal means of execution to obtain thesettlement of the due payments. The absence of suchaction may lead the Commission to conclude to theexistence of State aid. (207) No evidence of payment has been forwarded either tothe Commission for the irport charges to AIA following the adoption of a settlement agreement between OAand AIA for an amount of EUR 33,92 million. The Commission takes note of such an agreement. However, having not received any proof of payment as from todayand taking into account that the first payment shouldhave occurred in July, it cannot exclude that the agreement has not been respected. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, a normal creditor shouldhave claimed the total unpaid amount of instalmentsbearing default interests and would in that respect haveused all legal means of action, including, if needed, legalmeans of execution to obtain this settlement. The Commission has not received any information of this nature, it cannot exclude the existence of State aid. (208) No proof of payment has been adduced for the Spatosimo tax for the period of December 2000 toFebruary 2002, as well as the month of March 1999 foran amount of ca. EUR 60 999 156. As the Commissionhas not received the information that the tax has beenpaid, the tolerance of a persistent non-payment of thedue amount constitutes State aid. (209) Finally the offsetting of debts of the State and OA, or between Airports and OA for an amount of ca. EUR28,9 million, does not include details as the referenceperiod for the State's outstanding obligations toward OA. As the Law forming the basis for the offset lacks precision, the actual agreement itself reproduces suchvagueness, coupled with a lack of evidences. Therefore,the validity of these amounts cannot be verified and they cannot be invoked to demonstrate the absence of aid under the form of tolerance of a persistentnon-payment of airport charges.' (210) In relation to all measures considered as new aid herein,it needs first to be determined whether those measuresare imputable to the State. According to the judgementof the Court dated 1 6 May 2002 in case C-482/99(French Republic v. Commission )( 30), the imputability to the State of a measure taken by a public undertakingmay be inferred from a set of indicators arising fromthe circumstances of the case and the context in whichthat measure was taken. In the present case, there areno doubts that it is the State itself, which tolerates theconstant deferral, non-payment of different charges,taxes due by OA, as well as the infringement of Community and Greek law. In some other cases, the measures are imputable to airports or to IKA. As far asairports are concerned, the Greek authorities have statedthat all airports run by the HCAA are funded by theState budget and all income derived from their activitiesgoes to the State budget. Airports in Greece are not autonomous financially, nor is the HCAA. As for IKA, it is a public body established by the Greek Law ( 31), which has been made responsible, under Statesupervision for managing the social security system, andcollecting mandatory employers' and workers'socialsecurity contribution. The measure is, therefore, clearlyimputable to the State. (21 1) Secondly, it needs to be examined whether the newillegal aids involve any transfer of State resources. Thisis the case by accepting that OA does not pay in time(eight years delay for IKA, for instance) its differentfinancial obligations. It must be reminded to the Greekauthorities that deny the existence of State aid in thiscase, as they consider that there is no pecuniaryadvantage involved, that the concept of aid 'is wider thatthat of a subsidy because it embraces not only positive benefits, such as subsidies themselves, but also measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which arenormally included in the budget of an undertaking' ( 32). (212) Thirdly, it needs to be determined whether the new illegal aid distorts competition. The conduct of the Stategives OA a significant commercial advantage over itscompetitors by mitigating for OA the burden associatedwith normal application of the social security system, oflevies and airport charges. It gives OA the opportunityto regularly escape its financial obligations, incontradiction with normal commercial practices ( 33) and artificially maintains the Hellenic flag carrier alive. Even,if OA would pay the all amount of interests andpenalties due, as stated by the Greek authorities, in (30) The so-called Stardust Marine case. See in particular paragraph 55. (31) Greek development Law 1846/1 951, Article 1 1. (32) Case C-387/92 Banco Exterior de Espana V. Ayuntamiento de Valencia (1994) ECR 1-877 C-256/97 D.M. 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ENreturn for the generous payment facilities (34), these amounts cannot wholly undue the advantage gained by OA. IKA, as well as the fiscal authorities and airports by constantly accepting at their discretion the deferral ofpayments ( 35), must be held to have acted, vis-\u00e0-vis OA, as a public creditor which, like a private creditor, isseeking to obtain payment of sums owed to it by adebtor in financial difficulties ( 36). Considering the magnitude of the facilities obtained by OA by differentpublic bodies and their relative frequency, and takinginto account the fact that OA is in financial dire straits, OA would have been manifestly unable to obtain comparable facilities from a private creditor in the samesituation. Besides, such a creditor would not have allowed a situation where the debts continue to increase while the assets that might be used to satisfy these debtsare disappearing ( 37). On the contrary, a private creditor would have asked by all legal means the payment of thearrears or the execution of its guarantees. There isaccordingly a distortion of competition by favoring OAwithin the internal market, over the other Communityair-carriers. Indeed, aviation is a liberalised sector sincethe implementation of the third package in 1992. (213) Fourthly, the examined measures do affect tradebetween Member States, since OA carries a transportactivity, which by nature is a cross-border activity andcovers the whole internal market. (214) The Greek authorities cannot prevail themselves with the internal weaknesses of their own administration toallow the granting of further aid to OA, neither that because other companies do not fulfil their financial and fiscal obligations, OA could be allowed to be incontravention with the 1 994 and 1998 Decisions, nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans . Finally, that futurerelationship with OA have been rationalized, as ticketsfor civil servants will have to be purchased as pernormal practices. Such a statement only reinforces the Commission conviction that OA has never been allowed to operate as any other commercial entity. The fact thatthe State tries to change such a situation as per now,does not modify the fact that the Greek authorities havenot complied with their obligations derived from the1998 Decision not to grant further aid. Furthermore,the letter of the Secretary General of Ministry ofEconomy requiring that officials of the Greek State payaccording to market practices as of 1 May 2002, is of no legally binding nature to its addressees. Therefore, itremains to be seen, whether, currently, the Greek State is paying for the purchase of tickets from OA or any ofits subsidiaries. (215) On this basis the Commission considers that this new non-notified measure constitutes State Aid within themeaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty. 6.2.2 Legal basis for the assessment with regard to the alleged new aids concerning the tolerancewith default payment or any other advantageous treatment and the advantages in relation to the operation of the fuellingfacilities (21 6) To safeguard the functioning of the common market, and in view of the principles enshrined in Article 3(g)of the Treaty, derogations from the principles enshrinedin Article 87(1) and set out in Article 87(3) must bestrictly interpreted when a system of aid or anyindividual aid measure is under examination. (217) Article 87(2) of the Treaty, which provides for aidhaving a social character, aid making good the damagecaused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrencesand aid granted to the economy of certain areas of theFederal Republic of Germany is not applicable in thepresent case. (218) Article 87(3)(a) and (c) of the EC Treaty containderogation in respect of aid intended to promote theeconomic development of areas where the standard ofliving is abnormally low or where there is seriousunderemployment. Greece is a region falling entirelywithin the scope of Article 87(3)(a). Therefore the aidmay have to be assessed under regional aspects. The Commission does not consider this aid to meet any regional objectives as it has demonstrated in section6.1.2. (219) Article 87(3)(b) of the EC Treaty, which provides for aidto promote the execution of an important project ofcommon European interest or to remedy a serious(34) It must be reminded that for the social security the period covers eight years. (35) According to Law 267 6/1999 IKA has the right (not the obligation) to reach a settlement agreement for late payments or debts. (36) Case C-256/97 D.M. Transports, point 24. (37) Opinion of the Advocate-general Mischo, Case C-480/98, Magefesa, points 32 to 43, Rep I-8717 .28.5.2003 L 132/37 Official Journal of the European Union ENdisturbance in the economy of a Member State, and article 87(3)(d) of the EC Treaty, which provides for aidto promote cultural and heritage conservation, are notapplicable to aid to aviation transport. (220) Under Article 87(3)(c) of the EC Treaty, aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or ofcertain areas may be considered compatible with thecommon market, where such aid does not adverselyaffect trading conditions to an extent contrary to thecommon interest. In the case at stake, the Commissionconsiders Article 87(3)(c) of the EC Treaty as the legalinstrument, which could provide an exemption. It thisrespect it also considers that aid for restructuring maycontribute to the development of economic activitieswithout adversely affecting trade if the conditions setout in both Community Guidelines of 10 December1994 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to state aids in the aviation sector ( 38) and the Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty are met. 6.2.3 Appraisal of the compatibility of the alleged new aids (221) The new non-notified aids are clearly an infringement of the past commitment not to grant any further aid(Article 1(e) of the 1994 Decision) and contravene alsothe Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing andrestructuring firms in difficulty (paragraph 42). There isno legal or economic justification to accept these newaids. (222) More importantly, the grant of the new identifiedunlawful aid, has been examined against the backgroundthat OA has already received aid in the past, so that thecurrent situation indicates a clear breach of the'one-time-last-time' principle contained in both Community Guidelines of 10 December 1994 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to stateaids in the aviation sector, and the Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty. (223) Irrespective of the breach of the above principle, theexamination of the other conditions that shouldaccompany a restructuring aid according to the abovementioned guidelines, indicate that today, OA, while not respecting the ongoing restructuring plan, has still noalternative restructuring plan that can allow the Commission to conclude to a return to viability of the company in the medium and long term. (224) It results from the above that the new aids granted donot fulfil the conditions for a derogation laid down inarticle 87(3)(c). The Commission finds that Greece hasunlawfully granted non-notified new aid relating to thetolerance with default payment or any otheradvantageous treatment under Greek fiscal andcommercial law, as well advantages in relation to theoperation of the fuelling facilities in breach of Article88(3) of the Treaty. 6.3. Conclusion (225) The doubts prompting the Commission to initiate the procedure have been allayed as far as the commitments(b) and (f) of Article 1 of the 1994 decision (Article 1(a)of the 1 998 decision) are concerned, as well asconcerning the granting of EUR 19,5 million loan, thecompensation for the early eviction from Hellinikon toSpata, the debt of EUR 2,43 million towards Olympic Catering, the operation of the fuelling facilities and the payment of V AT at 8 % collected by OA on domestic fares. (226) The Commission takes the view that the abusive application of the 1 994 and 1998 aid and the new aid, except for the elements stated above, are incompatible with the common market as referred to in Article 87(1)of the Treaty because they do not meet any of thenecessary requirements for the application of thederogation provided for in Article 87(2) and (3). 6.4 Recuperation (227) In the light of the above, the Commission is of the view that the State aid granted by Greece to OA pursuant toDecision 94/696/EC and Decision 1 999/332/EC, isincompatible with the common market and needs to berecovered. (228) However, as far as the period of recovery is concerned,a distinction has to be made between the period 1994to 1 998, and 1 998 to 2002. In accordance with Article (38) OJ C 350, 10.12.1994, p. 5.L 132/38 28.5.2003 Official Journal of the European Union EN14(1) of Regulation (EC) 659/1999, 'The Commission shall not require recovery of the aid if this would becontrary to a general principle of Community law'. The Commission has taken into account in some occasions ( 39) that provision in order not to request recovery in the light of the specific circumstances ofthose cases. (229) The Commission adopted in 1994 the decision 94/696/EC authorising State aid with conditions.However, the Commission noticed that several of those conditions had not been observed and, therefore, it was decided to re-open the procedure. Subsequently, on 1 4August 1 998 the Commission took a new positivedecision with conditions. In that decision, in particularparagraphs 66(c), 68, 7 6, 83 and 91, the Commissionconsidered that all the commitments set out in Decision94/696/EC were fully complied with by Greece.Moreover, although the Commission concluded to theexistence of illegal and incompatible new aid, itnevertheless decided in paragraph 93(b) of that decision,not to recuperate that aid, which was fundamentallyequivalent to the aid authorised in the decision of 1 994.In order to ask for the recovery now, it can not beexcluded that the positive decision of the Commissionin 1 998 has created some kind of expectations that theaid package of 1 994 was unproblematic. Consequently,in the light of the very specific circumstances of this case, no recovery is necessary for the aid granted before 14 August 1 998. (230) The same cannot be said for the period 1 998 to 2002. First of all, it is recalled that the second tranche of EUR41 million of the restructuring aid was paid inSeptember 1 998, namely one month after the seconddecision of the Commission. Moreover, as far as newillegal aids are concerned, there is no decisionwhatsoever from the Commission that could create anyexpectation that the aid would not be recovered.Secondly, the timing of this Commission's decision iswithin normal practice. Finally, the core of the aid granted in that period is the new illegal aid for which the Commission has received two complaints (see point39 above). That new illegal aid has been examined indepth following the opening of the procedure launchedin March 2002, and where the Commission has foundthat there is State aid involved incompatible with thecommon market, there is no reason for not asking itsfull recovery.HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 The restructuring aid granted by Greece to Olympic Airways in the form of: (a) loan guarantees extended to the company until 7 October 1 994 pursuant to Article 6 of Greek Law 96/75 of 26 June1975 ; (b) new loan guarantees totalling USD 378 million for loans to be contracted before 31 March 2001 for the purchase ofnew aircraft and for investment necessary for therelocation of Olympic Airways to the new airport in Spata; (c) easing of the undertaking's debt burden by GRD 427 billion; (d) conversion of GRD 64 billion of the undertaking's debt to equity; (e) a capital injection of GRD 54 billion reduced to GRD 40,8 billion in three instalments of respectively GRD 19, 1 4 and7 ,8 billion in 1995, 1998 and 1999 respectively, is considered to be incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty, as the following conditions, under which the initial authorisation of the aid has been granted, are no longer met: (a) the full implementation of the restructuring plan aimed at the achievement of the long-term viability of the company; (b) the observance of 24 specific undertakings attached to the authorisation of the aid and; (c) the regular monitoring of the implementation of the restructuring aid. Article 2 The State aid which Greece has implemented in the form of tolerance of a persistent non-payment of social security obligations, of V AT on fuel and spare parts by Olympic Aviation, of rentals for different airports, of airports charges toAthens International Airport and other airports, of Spatosimotax is incompatible with the common market.
