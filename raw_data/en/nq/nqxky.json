One of the strongest banishing herbs, it is used for repelling evil, reversing hexes, and jinxing enemies. The pungent smell is said to ward off demons and provide a shield of protection around those who use it. It also aids in concentration and focus, helping those who are ungrounded to find their inner balance. Derived from the carrot family, Asafetida is an oleoresin that is gathered by piercing the root stem of the plant. The resin that is released appears almost translucent at first but turns a coppery red when it oxidizes. It contains a large amount of sulfur, which gives it a distinctive odor. This exotic spice is used in Indian and Asian cuisine, often used to flavor dhal, lentils, and other vegetable dishes. Ancient Chinese and holistic medicine used Asafetida to help calm digestive issues and nervous indigestion. The herb is mixed into a paste and rubbed on the abdomen to help ease cramping and abdominal discomfort. The essential oil contained in the spice is believed to help with respiratory conditions, as well as chronic fatigue syndrome. The herb is extremely strong, and it is recommended that it be used intermittently, rather than on a continual basis.
