If your child seems unfazed by a stuffy nose or [cough](/health/illness-and-infection/coughing-in-babies_11526), it's okay to skip the suctioning, gargling, warm liquids, and other remedies and let the illness run its course. But when it comes to helping your child feel better, these home remedies (plus a lot of TLC) can make a big difference. Home remedies for colds in babies A cold can make a baby pretty miserable. While there's not much you can do to speed up their recovery (and antibiotics won't help), there ways to make your baby more comfortable. Liquids - orally, in the air, and as a nasal treatment - are key. Extra fluids Your baby will feel better when well hydrated, and the extra fluids can help thin nasal secretions, too. [Breastfeeding](/baby/breastfeeding) or [formula feeding](/baby/formula-feeding) more frequently is the best way to keep your baby well hydrated. If your baby is having trouble at the breast or bottle because of stuffiness, try suctioning their nose first (see below). Caution: Stick to breast milk or formula for babies younger than 6 months old unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Babies that young [don't need water](/baby/solids-finger-foods/when-can-babies-drink-water_1368488), and too much could be harmful. Moist air Breathing moist air helps loosen the mucus in the nasal passages. Use a cool mist vaporizer or humidifier in your baby's bedroom when they're sleeping, resting, or playing in the room. Caution: Thoroughly clean and dry your humidifier every day. Mold and bacteria can accumulate inside it, and these can then spray into the air when you run the humidifier. Instead of using a vaporizer or humidifier, you can give your little one a warm [bath](/baby/bathing-body-care/when-can-i-give-my-baby-a-bath_9945) in a steamy bathroom. Let a hot shower run for a few minutes before getting the tub ready. Let them play in the bath as long as they like (supervised, of course). A warm bath has the added benefit of relaxing your baby. Or, you can create your own steam room: - Close the bathroom door. - Use a towel to block the gap under the door. - Run hot water in the tub or shower for a few minutes. - Sit in the steamy room with your child for about 15 minutes. Saline drops and nasal aspirator When kids are too young to blow their nose, saline drops and a [nasal aspirator](/baby-products/health-and-safety/best-baby-nasal-aspirators_40007446) can save the day. [Using an aspirator](/baby/bathing-body-care/how-to-use-a-bulb-syringe-or-nasal-aspirator-to-clear-a-stuf_482) will clear mucus from your child's nose and make it easier for them to nurse or drink from a bottle. Try using it about 15 minutes before a feeding. Advertisement | page continues below You'll need: - A nasal aspirator. This can be a simple rubber bulb syringe or a device with tubing that allows you to suction out the mucus with a mouthpiece. - Saline (salt water) nose drops or saline spray for infants and children. Both are available at pharmacies without a prescription. You also can prepare saline drops at home. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggests mixing 1/2 teaspoon table salt with 1 cup warm water. Caution: When making saline drops, the FDA recommends using only store-bought distilled or sterile water, or tap water that you've boiled for three to five minutes and cooled until lukewarm. Organisms in untreated tap water can survive in nasal passages and cause serious infection. Bacteria can grow in the solution, so don't keep it for more than 24 hours. To use saline drops: - Tip your child's head back, or lay them on their back with a rolled-up towel supporting their head. - Squeeze two or three drops of saline solution into each nostril. - Gently massage your child's nostrils. Wait a minute or two for the saline solution to thin and soften the mucus before suctioning. To suction with a bulb syringe: - Squeeze the bulb of the syringe, then gently insert the rubber tip into your baby's nostril. Some doctors recommend also gently closing off the other nostril with your finger to get better suction from the bulb syringe. - Slowly release the bulb to collect mucus and saline solution. - Remove the syringe and squeeze the bulb to expel the mucus into a tissue. - Wipe the syringe and repeat with the other nostril. - Repeat if necessary. - Clean the device with warm, soapy water. To suction with a tube-based nasal aspirator: - Make sure a clean filter is in place. (This prevents you from sucking mucus or bacteria through the tube into your mouth.) - Place the tube end against your baby's nostril, creating a seal. - Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and gently suck out the mucus. - Clean the device and add a clean filter for next time. Some tips: - Don't suction your child's nose more than a few times a day or you might irritate the nasal lining. - Don't use saline drops for more than four days in a row because they can dry out your baby's nose over time, making things worse. - You can also use the bulb syringe or aspirator without saline. - If your baby gets upset when you use an aspirator, try using just saline drops instead. Squirt a small amount into their nose, then gently massage their nose and use a cotton swab to swipe just within the outer edge of the nostrils. Be careful not to insert the swab inside the nostrils. - If your child's nose is irritated from rubbing or blowing, apply a little petroleum jelly or other child-safe ointment on the outside of their nose. Use a wet cotton swab to remove any sticky mucus around the nose. Watch our video on [how to use a bulb syringe](/health/illness-and-infection/how-to-use-a-bulb-syringe-to-clear-your-babys-mucus_10357065). Caution: Don't use nasal decongestant sprays on your baby or young child. Doctors don't recommend them for children younger than 6 and often don't advise them for older kids, either. Nasal decongestant sprays can have side effects in young children and may cause a rebound effect, making congestion worse in the long run. Warm liquids and chicken soup Warm, clear liquids can be very soothing and help relieve congestion for babies 6 months and older. Scientists have actually examined the ingredients in chicken soup and concluded that it's no myth: This old-fashioned remedy may help relieve cold symptoms such as congestion. Broth is a good alternative for babies who are still getting accustomed to solid foods. You can give older babies and toddlers warm water, broth, soup, or chamomile tea. Serve liquids warm, not hot. Lots of rest It takes energy to fight an infection, and that can wear out a baby, toddler, or child (and even adults). When your child rests, they're healing, which is exactly what they need to do. Don't worry if your baby is sleeping more than usual while they're sick. Let them go to bed a little earlier than usual or sleep in a little later, if you can. Your baby may even want an extra [nap](/baby/sleep/naps-the-first-year_1506357). At the same time, it can be challenging to get an uncomfortably sick baby to sleep soundly. Here are some tips that may help them get better sleep: - Try to stick to your usual routines at nap time and bedtime. - Get them as comfy as you can before they fall asleep. For example, use a bulb syringe or nasal aspirator if they're stuffed up and use a humidifier in their room. - Give your baby a warm bath. It's calming and may help relieve congestion, too. Home remedies for colds in toddlers and older kids The above remedies for babies are appropriate for toddlers and older kids, too. Like babies (and adults), older kids need plenty of rest, warm liquids, and humidity to treat a [cold](/health/medicine-and-first-aid/natural-remedies-for-cold-and-flu_10359025). But toddlers and older kids can also use the following remedies: Special foods and drinks It can be challenging to get your toddler or older child to eat and drink when they don't feel well. But it will help them to feel better, recover faster, and avoid [dehydration](/health/medicine-and-first-aid/dehydration-in-children_11407). For toddlers and older children, if plain water isn't appealing, you can also give fruit smoothies, juice, or ice pops made from 100 percent juice. Follow [the recommended juice amounts](/baby/solids-finger-foods/is-juice-good-for-kids_10345293) set by the AAP. Soft, chilled foods, like pudding or frozen yogurt, may be easier to swallow than the usual fare. You can also give warm water, chicken broth or soup, and chamomile tea. Serve liquids warm, not hot. Honey Honey coats and soothes the throat and helps tame a cough. (Keep in mind, though, that a cough isn't all bad - it helps clear secretions.) Some studies suggest honey works better than some commercial cough syrups at reducing coughing. Mix honey with hot water and a squeeze of lemon (which adds a little vitamin C), then let the drink cool until it's lukewarm. You can also give your child honey straight from a spoon. The AAP recommends these dosages: - Ages 1 to 5: 1/2 teaspoon - Ages 6 to 11: 1 teaspoon - Ages 12 and older: 2 teaspoons Because honey is sticky and sugary, have your child brush their teeth after they take it, especially if you give it to them at bedtime. Caution: Never give [honey](/baby/solids-finger-foods/when-can-my-baby-eat-honey_1368490) to a baby younger than 1 year old. In rare cases, it can cause infant botulism, a dangerous and sometimes fatal illness. Mentholated rub These rubs (for kids ages 2 and up) may ease breathing and coughing as the warmth of your child's body helps release the medication into the air for them to breathe. Apply a thin layer to a small area of your child's chest. Store the container out of your kid's reach. Nose blowing Clearing mucus from your child's nose helps them breathe and sleep more easily, and it can generally make them more comfortable. Many kids don't master nose blowing until they're at least 4, but some can do it around age 2 - if you give them some pointers. Tips for teaching nose blowing: - Demonstrate how to do it. For some kids, that's all it takes. - Explain that blowing the nose is \"smelling backward.\" - Have your child hold one nostril shut and practice gently blowing air out the other nostril. - Teach them to blow gently and explain that blowing too hard can hurt their ears. - Teach them to throw used tissues in the trash and to [wash their hands](/health/illness-and-infection/proper-hand-washing-for-kids-and-parents_10317767) or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer gel after blowing their nose. - Be sure they know not to rub their eyes after blowing their nose (so they don't end up with an [eye infection](/health/illness-and-infection/pinkeye-conjunctivitis-in-children_11283#articlesection3)). If your child's nose is sore from all the sniffling and blowing, you can rub a little petroleum jelly or other child-safe ointment around their nostrils. Gargling with salt water Gargling with salt water is a time-honored way to soothe a [sore throat](/health/illness-and-infection/sore-throat-in-children_66420). It also helps clear mucus from the throat. Dissolve 1/2 teaspoon salt in a glass of warm water and stir. Add a squirt or two of fresh lemon juice if your child likes the taste. Many kids won't learn to gargle until they're school age or older, but some children can manage it sooner. Aim to have your child gargle three or four times a day while they're sick. Have a younger child gargle only if they're willing and it makes them feel better. A few tips for teaching your child to gargle: - Practice with plain water. - Tell your child to tilt their head up and try to hold the water in the back of their throat without swallowing it. - Once they're comfortable doing that, have them try to make gargling sounds in their throat. Show them what that looks and sounds like by demonstrating a gargle yourself. - Remind them to spit out the water rather than swallow it. Neti pot A neti pot flushes a mild saline solution through the nasal passages, moisturizing the area and thinning, loosening, and rinsing away mucus. Think of it as nasal irrigation. Don't force your child to use a neti pot if they don't want to. This needs to be a very gentle procedure - it isn't painful but does feel strange at first. It's definitely not for babies or young toddlers, and older children (and even adults) might not go for it. A neti pot looks like a very small watering can or teapot and is typically ceramic, metal, or plastic. You can buy neti pots at drugstores, natural-food stores, and online. You'll also need saline solution. Either store-bought or homemade works. If you make your own, mix 1/2 teaspoon table salt with 1 cup warm water. Note: A solution that comes with the neti pot might be too strong for a child. Caution: Use only store-bought distilled or sterile water, or boiled and cooled tap water. Untreated tap water may contain organisms that are safe to drink because stomach acid kills them but can survive in nasal passages and cause serious infection. Boil tap water for three to five minutes, then cool to lukewarm. After boiling, tap water can be stored in a clean, covered container for use within 24 hours. Practice yourself before teaching your child to use a neti pot. You may also want to watch videos of people using a neti pot to see how it works. Here's the basic method: - Fill the neti pot with warm water or saline solution. - Bending over a sink, tilt your head to one side, breathe through your mouth, and place the spout of the pot deep in the top nostril. The water will flow gently through the nasal cavity and out the other nostril. - Repeat on the other side. Let your child watch you use it, and then help them if they're up for it. Tilt your child's head sideways over the sink, and place the spout of the pot in their top nostril. Then gently pour water or saline solution from the neti pot through the nasal passages to clean and moisturize them. This may take a little trial and error, but it's easy once you get the hang of it. (At first you may want to practice with your child in the tub or shower.) Make sure you clean the neti pot well after each use. Nasal strips Like the nasal strips made for adults, kids' versions (sized for small noses) reportedly use gentle pressure to lift the nostrils so it's easier to breathe while sleeping. They don't contain any medication, and are appropriate for kids ages 5 and up. Just place the strips as directed across your child's nose at bedtime and remove them in the morning. Learn more "}
