OUR HISTORY The Royal Society of Canada (RSC) was established in 1882 as a collegium of distinguished Canadian scholars and scientists, under the auspices of the Governor General of Canada, His Excellency the Right Honorable the Marquis of Lorne. It was incorporated by Act of Parliament on May 25th, 1883. Over the years, more than 4000 men and women have been elected to the Fellowship. Canada's National Academy, the RSC is a not-for-profit organization infused with a strong spirit of cooperation, one that recognizes and celebrates excellence within the Fellowship, shares knowledge and research, and voluntarily provides independent evidence-based policy advice to Canadians. OUR SOCIETY The Royal Society of Canada consists of three bilingual Academies and the College of New Scholars. Fellows and Members are elected from the social sciences and humanities, the natural sciences and engineering, and the health sciences and artistic fields. 2 The Royal Society of CanadaMessage froM the President In her remarks at last year's Celebration of Excellence and Engagement, Her Excellency the Governor- General of Canada and RSC honorary patron, Julie Payette, emphasized that \"Canada and the world are facing many challenges and opportunities, many of which are deeply complex and intertwined. We need everyone's involvement, and in particular the talented and creative minds of the Royal Society of Canada to cooperate, move forward and help find solutions for the future.\" One year later with the guidance of our new Strategic Plan, Mobilize, Catalyze, Sustain , I am delighted to report considerable progress in mobilizing leaders within and beyond the RSC to catalyze informative and advisory activities for sustained impact. Throughout 2018, we have been benefitting greatly from our defining strength: members who are exceptionally talented leaders across all research fields and from multiple generations in numerous domestic and international communities. Highlights include our G7 initiative with domestic and international partners; the strengthening of our pan- Canadian presence on the model of RSC Atlantic; and the updating of governance and management structures, policies and practices to embrace inclusive excellence, efficiency and effectiveness in our operations. As host for the G7 Science Academies, Canada's national representative, the RSC embraced the opportunity to contribute the latest insights and evidence to the political deliberations of G7 political leaders. Following engagement with federal colleagues and together with G7 Academy partners, we selected two topics for specific attention not only in formal statements on them but also in a series of G7 Research Summits: (1) The Global Arctic: the sustainability of northern communities in the context of changing ocean systems; and (2) Our digital future and its impact on knowledge, industry and the workforce. As our major strategic effort to cultivate informed discussion and public policy debate, the RSC G7 initiative has been wonderfully successful, if we judge by partner engagement, attendance at events and feedback within and beyond government. With the active support of Minister of Science and Sport, Kirsty Duncan, and Canada's G7 Sherpa, Peter Boehm (now Senator), many of the Academy recommendations on Our Digital Future and the Global Arctic were reflected in the G7 Summit Communiqu\u00e9 as well as the seven Charlevoix commitments. These documents included, for example, our recommendations on ensuring ethical and human-centered approaches to AI, promoting lifelong learning and digital literacy and promoting research and development in ocean science. It is similarly encouraging that, thanks to the initiative of many RSC members, we are making impressive progress toward our strategic goal of building on the success of RSC Atlantic by working toward additional regional hubs. Last winter and spring, colleagues in British Columbia and in Qu\u00e9bec began meeting to explore how best to leverage local engagement with pan-Canadian collaboration in order to deepen and enrich the impact of our various initiatives. We are now hopeful that RSC Pacific and RSC Qu\u00e9bec will be officially established in the coming year. More immediately, we have now finalized RSC@Massey, a new partnership with Massey College that includes a position of Visiting Fellow as well as the opportunity to take initiatives in the greater Toronto area; we look forward to the initial year of programming in 2019. Throughout the year and thanks to the advice of key RSC members, we have been updating our policies and processes including those related to nomination and selection of new Fellows and College Members as well as governance and ethics. In all our activities, we have been focused on the principles of inclusion, equity and diversity in order to make decisions reflecting the highest standards of excellence. The implementation of these and other components of our strategic plan would not be possible without the talent and determination of those at the secretariat in Walter House, and it is a privilege to work with them. Much more needs to be done, of course. I invite all RSC members and friends to read this Annual Report not only to review the past year but also with a view toward contributing to, and perhaps accelerating, our strategic plan in 2019 and beyond. As the headlines remind us every day, there seems no more important work for us than to cultivate societal trust in science and scholarship as an essential underpinning of enhanced quality of life for all. While we can be confident that steps forward have been taken, we must continue to act boldly and collaboratively to do all that we can to help make a better a future for Canada and the world. Chad Gaffield President 3 2017-18 Annual ReportIn reflecting on the year behind us, we also keep our eyes fixed forward in the conviction that, ultimately, our organization is about people committed to working together. The complimentary contributions of the membership and the team at Walter House form an integral component of the RSC's future. This future continues to brighten. Darren Gilmour Executive Director Message froM the executive director Dear Colleagues, The new Strategic Plan\u2014 Mobilize, Catalyze, Sustain \u2014 arrived at an auspicious moment for the team at Walter House, providing a clear road map to leverage the momentum of recent growth in regional, national and international activities. The strategic plan set the stage for a number of initiatives that have strengthened our nimbleness and performance in supporting the work of Council and the key activities of the membership in a number of ways. Our team has strengthened with Linda Clauson's enhanced role as Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, assuming oversight of the day-to-day functioning of Walter House and our team. Together, our team has implemented a new financial system, soft-launched a new website, and expanded our communications tools. These updates have enhanced our speed of responsiveness to inquiries from members and partners; diffused a renewed branding, logo and coloration; and increased our organizational nimbleness, as you will have noticed from your personalized voting experience in this year's RSC and Academy presidential election processes. These tools have also supported the Walter House team in seizing opportunities such as those that arose in the context of the G7 events held this year. The increasing strength of the team at Walter House has been enabled by Council's standing committees, which have worked throughout the year to enhance pathways both in terms of internal processes such as elections and nominations, and also in terms of the ways in which the RSC fulfills its core roles such as the recognition of excellence and the provision of advice. Updated terms of reference for the Committee on Public Engagement will leverage many of these newly created tools in order to more effectively disseminate findings and mobilize knowledge. As we arrive in Halifax for our annual celebrations, I am delighted to confirm that we have secured partnerships for the RSC's Celebration of Excellence and Engagement for the duration of our new strategic plan. This forecasting enables us to build out the contours of these wonderful celebrations in the unique co-creation model that serves the RSC so well.

From late 2016 to late 2017, Fellows, Members of the College, Institutional Member leaders and others from the larger society participated in meetings and gatherings across Canada. Eleven months of engagement and consultation produced a rich assortment of perspectives and ideas. Following the year-long consultation, the RSC made the following strategic choices for the coming five-year period:MOBILIZING THE MEMBERSHIP The strength of the RSC lies in its membership that spans research fields, generations and Canada together with members and partners around the world. The objective of this priority is to optimize this unique capacity by strategically mobilizing members to engage each other and the larger society on specific issues of concern. CATALYZING NEW CONTRIBUTIONS The ability of the RSC to have impact in its activities is closely connected both to the means and the ends of such activities. In the changing context of the early 21st century, the objective of this priority is to create and implement new strategic ways to engage effectively in keeping with our unique cross-disciplinary and multigenerational membership, and the network of Institutional Members. SUSTAINING MOMENTUM The success of the RSC over the past 135 years has reflected continuing efforts to renew and grow in keeping with the changing times. The objective of this priority is to ensure that near-term goals and activities are informed by a long- term vision to ensure the enduring success of the RSC. THE RSC'S INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY 1. The RSC will address major global challenges collaboratively by mobilizing its multidisciplinary and multigenerational leadership with other National Academies to understand the current state of knowledge; to identify research or knowledge gaps in technology and policy development; and to share approaches and action plans to address some of the world's most pressing issues. 2. The RSC will advance inclusive excellence through international collaboration. In proactively updating our own practices with respect to gender, diversity and inclusion, the RSC recognizes that a wide range of approaches are required to address these global issues. The RSC will work collaboratively with other national academies to enhance mutual learning toward more effective modes of inclusive excellence. 3. Through its Committee on Public Engagement, the RSC will continue its commitment to contributing to the defense of human rights through the leadership of the Human Rights Network based at the US National Academies.4. The advisory capacity of the RSC will be marshalled in collaboration with our cohort Academies around the world to monitor emerging trends of research and provide a 'Canadian perspective' on selected advisory documents from partners such as expert panel reports.international engageMent Marie D'Iorio, International Secretary 2017-18 Annual Report 56 The Royal Society of Canada iMPleMenting the strategic Plan: g7 r esearch initiatives G7 ACADEMIES' SUMMIT March 18-20, The Museum of Nature/The Westin, Ottawa The year 2018 was a banner year for Canada in terms of showcasing leadership on global topics based on robust research. RSC Fellows and College Members have built their careers in the context of Canada's impressive Federal support for world-class science and scholarship during the past half-century. Canada's hosting of the G7 offered an ideal opportunity to share insights and evidence about global issues and along the way, of course, an opportunity to illustrate how research in Canada has moved from the international margins to centre stage. Each year since 2005, the National Academies of the G7 countries have delivered joint statements in time for the G7 political summit, articulating the best available knowledge on key matters of global concern. The objective of the statements is to contribute to the deliberations of the political summit. Following a consultation period during the summer and fall of 2017, the RSC selected two topics for drafting during the G7 Academies' Summit: (1) The Global Arctic: The sustainability of northern communities in the context of changing ocean systems ; and (2) Our Digital Future and its Impact on Knowledge, Industry, and the Workforce . The statements were presented to Minister Duncan in April. Using the statements as a starting point, the RSC organized a series of events throughout 2018 that focused on enriching discussion of these topics. The full text of both statements is available on Pages 40-46. Leaders from the National Academies of the G7 Nations (L to R): Dr. Germany; Takeuchi, Japan; Giovanni Seminara, Italy; the Hon.

Dal.ca/200years17 2017-18 Annual ReportacadeMY of the arts & h uManities Division of Humanities BECK, Hans - Department of History and Classical Studies, McGill University Hans Beck's path-breaking work has led to major innovations in the study of ancient Greek and Roman political culture. Beyond the Mediterranean World, he is an active agent in the development of international research networks in comparative history, including comparisons with ancient China. His prolific output informs contemporary debates about local and global paradigms, the relationship between ethnicity and federalism, and the modes of economic cooperation in federal systems. BERGEN, Doris - Department of History, University of Toronto Doris Bergen is an internationally recognized Holocaust historian. Using an integrative approach, viewing the Holocaust and war as intertwined and considering Jews and non-Jews as victims, she reveals the dynamic contagion of extreme violence. Her innovations established Christianity as a key component of Nazi antisemitism; defined the importance of ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe to anti-Jewish policies; and demonstrated the significance of gender and sexuality in the Holocaust. BLAKE, Raymond - Department of History, University of Regina Raymond B. Blake's innovative historical research has opened up new ways of thinking about Canada. His scholarship on federalism, social welfare, and national identity has demonstrated that public policy is shaped by the demands of all people to participate equitably in Canada's social and economic citizenship. He is the author of several acclaimed monographs explaining how citizenship has been a powerful force in either creating political crises or solving them. GICK, Bryan - Department of Linguistics, The University of British Columbia Bryan Gick's pioneering work uncovering the basic mechanisms of spoken language is remarkable for its originality, impact and breadth. He has made surprising discoveries in multimodal perception, advanced theories of movement control, developed applications for ultrasound imaging in language teaching and clinical intervention and co-developed ArtiSynth, the state-of-the-art biomechanical modelling platform for head/ neck/face simulation, applied in areas from surgical planning to telecommunications and computer animation. class of 2018 n ew fellows JUDGE, Joan - Department of History, York University Joan Judge has reshaped understanding of modern Chinese history through methodologically innovative studies in Chinese print culture, periodical studies, and women's history. Prominent among her publications are three books: Print and Politics: 'Shibao' and the Culture of Reform in Late Qing China; The Precious Raft of History: The Past, the West, and the Woman Question in China; and Republican Lens: Gender, Visuality, and Experience in the Early Chinese Periodical Press.

It is believed that international cooperation will be essential in key areas of security, accessibility, and regulation to secure a digital future that is inclusive, democratically governed and ethically minded in which open data and reliable information can circulate. With these objectives, the Academies propose the following principles of action: Inclusion and access with the goal of equal opportunity to participate in and gain from the digital transformation, to channel gains equitably and eliminate digital divides. Information literacy relying on a comprehensive educational plan for all age groups with the objective of providing skills and tools allowing citizens to critically interpret, verify and validate the quality of information circulating in the digital infrastructure. Quality of tools and standards through robust mechanisms for production, validation, access and dissemination of open data, information and machine learning systems, to strengthen reliability and security, preventing tampering, manipulation and privatizing use of data and ensuring that machine learning algorithms are interpretable by non-specialists. Democratic governance in the form of regulatory frameworks to set up an oversight of internet service providers, social media and other entities and prevent private monopolistic or oligopolistic power in the digital economy and to ensure open and neutral internet, protection of digital data and respect for norms of individual privacy. Employment and training policies to encourage new economic activities, foster emerging technological sectors and ensure that the benefits of new technologies also be distributed to workers and that schemes be available for their training and reemployment. Ethics and human values should guide the development of digital technologies, artificial intelligence and big data analytics and intervene in all stages of digital innovations to preserve values of freedom, democracy, justice and trust.stateMent of the g7 a cadeMies41 2017-18 Annual ReportREALIZING OUR DIGITAL FUTURE AND SHAPING ITS IMPACT ON KNOWLEDGE, INDUSTRY, AND THE WORKFORCE The promises and challenges of the digital revolution continue to expand and change, making the precise character of our digital future profoundly uncertain. We must urgently focus on key policy challenges and principles for action in order to make optimal decisions and choices for realizing our digital future and shaping its impact on knowledge, industry and the workforce. This statement highlights these challenges and principles by drawing upon insights and evidence from across scientific and scholarly fields. Civil society groups, governments, businesses and individuals have been embracing information and communication technologies (ICTs) in digital tools that drive innovation, economic growth, and social prosperity. These tools support the capturing of data to drive insight and knowledge creation while facilitating access to information, collaboration, learning, discovery, and sharing across geographical distances and national borders. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, crowdsourcing, big data analytics, blockchain, digital transactions, and automation increase efficiencies in production and service delivery, change the nature of work, and make new business models possible. Future developments, including quantum computing, may accelerate these changes. New ways of conducting science, learning and collaboration across all research fields emerge from increasing insights from data. At the same time, potential vulnerabilities and perils expand and change with the increasing importance of the digital revolution. Digital technologies disrupt existing business practices, social structures, and economic relationships. Such technologies reshape economies, changing the boundaries between market and non-market activities, disrupting jobs, reducing individual agency in decision-making, diminishing control over personal data, and devaluing labour. The rate and scale of change brought about by the digital revolution magnify the challenges for those unable to take advantage of its opportunities or disproportionately affected by rapid transformations. As ICT developments increasingly affect individual and collective decision-making and understandings of the world, those without adequate digital literacy are seriously disadvantaged. Accordingly, a central challenge of our time consists of harnessing this wave of widespread disruption to ensure that benefits are distributed equitably, that deleterious effects and vulnerabilities are addressed, and that increasing risks are contained. Governments around the world have been preparing for the digital future, working in partnership with international organizations, national scientific academies, and other agencies. Initiatives are underway to better reflect social needs as tomorrow's digital technologies and information resources are developed. Strategies to enable universal access to the tools and networks that power digital economies and support social inclusion are being implemented, albeit unevenly. Individuals, businesses, civil society, and governments are now positioned to reap massive benefits from the adoption of digital technologies by collectively recognizing, critically reflecting upon, and addressing five policy challenges. POLICY CHALLENGES 1. Inclusion and Equity of Access: The digital revolution presents tremendous opportunities to reduce socio- economic inequalities within and among countries. At the same time, accessibility gaps and forms of polarization are intensifying existing stratification between \"winning\" and \"losing\" economic sectors, businesses, social groups, and even societies\u2014thereby potentially excluding significant parts of humankind from the gains of this revolution. Educational and infrastructure programs to grant all citizens access to digital skills needed for jobs of the future; to high- speed internet; and to media and information literacy remain underfunded or underdeveloped. Digital inequities are particularly evident in remote, rural, and poor communities. Social media platforms and online forums, valued for enabling the free exchange of ideas and networked social interaction, have also become spaces in which some citizens (disproportionately women, Indigenous peoples, racialized communities, and diverse vulnerable groups) experience harassment and abuse. Technological interfaces designed for some groups of users but not others can curtail the ability and willingness of citizens to participate in digitally- mediated public debate. 2. Information Quality, Security, and Resilience: The quantity of data produced and disseminated through digital technologies and platforms has not yet been matched by a corresponding bolstering of procedures and norms to verify and validate the sources, quality, diversity, and technical accuracy of the data, nor by policies to protect the security and ensure the resilience of digital infrastructure. All major infrastructure systems have become digitally-based and have major cyber vulnerabilities. Public understanding of key issues and problems may be stagnating in some areas (such as climate change or vaccinations) as information bubbles have proliferated. The potential for subtle or covert manipulation of public opinion is growing, while public confidence and trust in traditional sources of information and knowledge (such as scientific bodies and media of record) erodes. As dependence on data, ICTs and their related systems grows, so does the significance of their vulnerabilities and potential failures. 3. Transparency, Openness, and Interoperability: Many recent technological transformations have appropriated personal data, fostered proprietary standards, or utilized \"black boxed\" algorithms. Examples include social scoring to quantify individual 42 The Royal Society of Canadarisk, shortlisting of job candidates, setting of prices for online transactions, and the selection of optimized and suppressed information in social media. The lack of regulatory structures to ensure oversight, transparency, interoperability, interpretability, and scrutiny of digital data and its uses presents a challenge to democratic principles of openness and accountability. Where the complexity of some systems, such as those based on deep learning, makes their outputs difficult to explain, new approaches to ensuring openness and accountability may be required, based on understanding how these systems work in practice. 4. The Future of Work: Driven by developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital technologies and business strategies are leading to the automation or replacement of jobs across various skills and economic sectors, while creating a variety of new jobs and augmenting the abilities of workers to perform in existing and emerging industries. The ultimate effects of these changes depend on the direction of technological innovation, and how workers, employers, and policy makers respond to it. The evidence thus far shows that the resulting disruption is producing an uneven distribution of work-related gains and losses within and between societies, in terms of job security, wages, working time, or entrepreneurial opportunities. 5. Ethics: Digital capacities have outpaced the institutional arrangements and public understanding on which normative frameworks can be based to ensure that innovation respects principles of public good and human welfare. The fact that something can be done does not necessarily imply that it should be done, notably in the absence of clearly defined ethical guidelines (in the cases of autonomous systems and weaponized artificial intelligence, for instance). The shift from analogue to digital life demands new ethical frameworks to address new fundamental questions regarding the reconciliation of digital technologies to human values, the consequences of human interactions with intelligent machines, and the meaning of responsible innovation. PRINCIPLES FOR ACTION Broad engagement across civil society, industry and governments will be essential to collectively address the five policy challenges noted above, and thereby to realize the potential of the digital revolution to enhance quality of life for everyone. Equity, inclusion, security, and prosperity in our digital world is the responsibility of all. We suggest the following principles for action. 1. Inclusion and Access: The goal of equal opportunity for all to participate in and gain from digital transformations requires consultative design and continuing public dialogue and public programs. Public programs should aim to disseminate technical skills and make data and digital infrastructure accessible to citizens regardless of geographical location or socio-economic status. It is essential to measure and monitor inclusivity in emerging technological areas. Public programs are essential to channel the gains of technological disruption equitably across societies, while preventing disruption from disproportionately affecting vulnerable segments of the population and workforce. While progress has been made on this front, digital divides persist and must be eliminated as a matter of priority. 2. Information Literacy: In addition to access to data, citizens need general digital skills and tools. Citizens now require increasing familiarity with ethical issues surrounding the uses and applications of ICTs, and critical literacy to interpret and validate the quality of information. Among multiple benefits, such capacity can help guard against false claims and coordinated disinformation campaigns. Citizens should be able and encouraged to participate in online interaction through which they can express their opinions and disseminate information. In this way, digital public spaces such as social media platforms can better find a balance between two fundamental democratic norms\u2014protecting freedom of expression and eliminating hate speech. Comprehensive education to develop such digital literacy skills is required for all ages. 3. Quality of Tools and Standards: Robust mechanisms, procedures, and standards for the production, validation, and dissemination of data and information are needed to strengthen data reliability, infrastructure security and resilience, interoperability, accessibility, transparency, and factual accuracy. This could include new standards or guidance to create trustworthy and resilient cybersecurity systems. At the same time, action is required to prevent tampering, manipulation, and arbitrary or privatizing uses of data and digital infrastructure. Quality control measures and open standards are essential for effective evidence-based scientific research and societal decision-making, and to secure citizens' trust in democratic institutions. Long- term preservation and curation of data resources are essential. Such measures and standards must be co- designed, implemented and enforced by stakeholders within governmental and international organizations, the private sector, and civil society. Developers should ensure that machine learning methods and algorithms are interpretable by non-specialists and thus open to public scrutiny. 4. Democratic Governance: Regulatory frameworks and policies are needed to provide democratically governed oversight of internet service providers, social media corporations and other entities that serve as gatekeepers and data stewards. The emergence of private monopolistic or oligopolistic power in 43 2017-18 Annual Reportthe digital economy should be prevented in order to safeguard the principles of an open and neutral internet. It is vital to ensure service neutrality and to ensure the protection of digital data to respect norms of individual privacy and safety while preserving data in the public domain. Patterns of data use in the 21st century have led to a reflection on ownership and control of personal data and information by the individual; humans and their digital selves must enjoy rights to dignity and respect. International cooperation will be essential to the implementation of this principle. 5. Employment and Training: Appropriate public policies and private investment models must encourage new economic activities and employment opportunities, and foster the growth of small- and medium-sized players, as well as fund and support\u2014through tax incentives or targeted strategic investments\u2014training and re-employment opportunities for workers. Education, training, and mentoring are needed to complement technical knowledge. Such opportunities should also address creativity, innovation, adaptability, and interpersonal skills to adjust to changing labour markets. Policies should ensure that the benefits of new technologies be distributed to workers in the form of reduced or more flexible working hours, higher wages, and better working conditions. These benefits should also contribute to societal needs via appropriate tax policies. 6. Ethics and Human Values: Appropriate ethical models must guide the development of digital and computationally-based technologies, artificial 4 STATEMENT OF THE G7 ACADEMIES OF SCIENCEbackgrounds that will ensure the necessary ex- pertise is available internationally; Training those residing in the Arctic is essential: this will incorporate locally-driven science ques - tions and foster development of circumpolar re- search infrastructure. 3.

Innovation should be pursued within a framework of ethical considerations regarding human welfare and ecological preservation. Shared social norms, moral frameworks, and technical principles\u2014such as open data standards, responsible technological development, and the protection of nature\u2014are essential to our global digital future. CONCLUSION The digital revolution is transforming the early 21st century, leading to the creation of entirely new industries based upon artificial intelligence and machine learning, and lowering barriers to participation in and access to data, education, and communication tools for citizens around the world. By drawing upon insights and evidence from across scientific and scholarly fields to address specific policy challenges and guided by the principles highlighted in this statement, we believe that significant gains can be harnessed and optimized, via national and regional governments and institutions, civil society and private sector actors. International cooperation will be essential in key areas of security, accessibility, and regulation. Our Academies intend to continue our efforts to inform this process and contribute to ongoing communication and international collaboration amongst all stakeholders. Together, we can secure a digital future that is inclusive, democratically governed, ethically minded, and in which open data and reliable information can circulate\u2014that is, a future in which all citizens will be equipped to respond to challenges and take advantages of emerging opportunities.44 The Royal Society of Canadathe gloBal arctic: the sustainaBilitY of coMMunities in the context of changing ocean sYsteMs MaY 2018 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Arctic is being profoundly transformed by climate change. This has implications on terrestrial and marine ecosystems, affecting those who live on and from them. It is time to develop a shared scientific vision to protect these vital ecosystems as best we can, produce science for evidence- based decision-making and enhance collaborative scientific investigations of these issues. The G7 Academies propose the following: Research cooperation relying on augmented interdisciplinary research supported by large scale international science initiatives in combination with cooperative decision-making among Arctic nations; Training individuals from a diversity of fields and backgrounds, including those residing in the Arctic, to ensure the necessary scientific capacity to address global and local issues; Accessible, usable and timely science databases that can be shared among all stakeholders and decision makers; Programs on remote sensing linked with in-situ monitoring activities integrating sustained high- inclination satellite missions, new technologies for underwater measurements and regionally-integrated in-situ monitoring that incorporates local knowledge.stateMent of the g7 a cadeMies45 2017-18 Annual ReportA CHANGING ARCTIC OCEAN AND ECOSYSTEMS Arctic air temperature is increasing at twice the rate of the global average, equating to an approximate 2\u00b0C increase over the course of the 20th century. Since satellite measurements began in 1979, Arctic sea ice extent has declined in all months of the year and at an astonishing rate of 13.2% per decade for the month of September (or 86,100 square kilometers per year). These changes have global consequences for ocean temperatures, salinity, water circulation and acidification. Particularly significant is the Greenland ice sheet, which has been losing about 270 billion tons of ice every year since the early 2000s, and as a result now contributes to around 25% of global mean sea level rise. Fresh water increases in the Arctic due to sea ice melting, Greenland ice mass loss, and Siberian river runoff alter Arctic ocean circulation patterns, and impact air-sea interactions and related chemical exchange processes that can have consequences on a global scale. Changes to the Arctic climate system have resulted in less predictable weather patterns; sea ice formation occurring later, earlier sea ice break-up; melting of glaciers; thawing permafrost, with the potential increase of methane release; increased coastal and soil erosion. Most researchers expect that, due to climate change, the Arctic will become largely free of sea ice (i.e. less than 1 million km2 in extent) during the summer months sometime between 2030 and 2070, profoundly transforming regional and global environmental processes. All of these factors will result in profound changes to important feedback loops such as when sea ice, which reflects light, turns to open water that absorbs heat \u2014meaning that climate change will continue in the region and at an accelerated rate. Furthermore, there will be a significant shift in the abundance of species, their seasonal occurrence and geographic distribution, thereby affecting Arctic food webs and local food security. HEALTHY OCEANS, HEALTHY COMMUNITIES, AND HEALTHY PEOPLES The Arctic is being significantly impacted by climate change. Biophysical impacts related to changing temperature, precipitation, extreme weather events, sea ice, and permafrost will have implications for terrestrial and marine ecosystems, which in turn have consequences for the health and well-being of the numerous coastal communities in the region. All communities in the Arctic will be affected as they rely on the services of healthy ecosystems for hunting, fishing, local economic enterprises, as well as for physical and mental health. The seaways enable bulk maritime re-supply with essential north/south and international economic connections that are fundamental to domestic and international trade. There is also a strong and vibrant Indigenous presence in many communities across the Arctic where cultural networks transcend national borders, where travel over water and importantly over sea ice has occurred for thousands of years, and where connections to a healthy ocean are entwined in the cultural fabric and well-being of local society.SOVEREIGNTY, SECURITY AND SUSTAINABILITY The changing Arctic Ocean also has major implications for global security, national sovereignty, and international trade related to: increased access to new global marine trade and transportation routes; lengthened ice-free shipping seasons; and increased opportunities and pressures related to Arctic tourism, Arctic fisheries and natural resource development. It is predicted that climate-related changes to the Arctic regions could stimulate investments ranging from US$ 85-265bn over the next decade, offering the potential for significant and long-term sustainability opportunities for communities and governments in the region. However, with these largely climate change-induced socio-economic changes come increased potential risks such as: oil spills, shipping disasters and environmental contamination with subsequent public health risks, as well as the potential for the introduction of invasive species. There are also ramifications for search and rescue operations, human safety, mortality, and morbidity, together with impacts to infrastructure and livelihoods in the North. There are also risks related to local capacity, whereby larger global forces may overwhelm and impede locally led initiatives. While the Arctic marine environment sustains unique and globally important ecosystems, it remains among the least- understood basins and bodies of water in the world. This lack of scientific understanding is concerning, as changes to the Arctic Ocean have complex and wide-reaching biophysical implications for local and global environmental processes. They also have significant repercussions for the health and well-being of local communities, and they could influence the future of global maritime trade, and with it, the potential for altered global power relations. SHARING A SCIENTIFIC VISION FOR PEOPLES AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS The G7 Academies stress the critical need to support and enhance basic Arctic research endeavours and cooperation that promote healthy and thriving coastal communities in the context of changing ocean systems. To address this need, the G7 Academies propose a vision of broad international collaboration that includes natural, social, and health sciences, engineering, humanities, and Indigenous knowledge in order to: Understand how climate change and human activities impact vital Arctic ecosystems; Develop innovative and interdisciplinary approaches and technologies to address these challenges; Use this knowledge to enable rich and robust evidence- based decision-making to inform decisions and manage and minimize environmental and sociological impacts.46 The Royal Society of Canadafinancial stateMents 4 STATEMENT OF THE G7 ACADEMIES OF SCIENCEbackgrounds that will ensure the necessary ex- pertise is available internationally; Training those residing in the Arctic is essential: this will incorporate locally-driven science ques - tions and foster development of circumpolar re- search infrastructure. 3.
