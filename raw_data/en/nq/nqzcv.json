I Have quite a collection of books in the same field as Grow Your Own Herbal Remedies By Maria Noel Groves. However, this book stands out from the crowd in so many ways. The photography is really lovely for a start . This book covers a huge selection of topics and skills that you need to be aware of before you attempt the grow your own remedies. This book is a mine of information, the topics covered are well written and very informative.

She has included recipes and lots of details on various plants and herbs and finishes with a magnificent A-Z of plants and herbs too. Maria really has put together everything you could wish to know in one book. A wonderful book. I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own. A very thorough reference for growing, harvesting, processing, storing, and using herbal remedies. Will definitely have to refer to this book again and again during garden planning time, and for ideas/recipes for various herbal goodness. *Thanks to NetGalley for the ARC, provided by the author and/or the publisher in exchange for an honest review. I love reading herbal remedy books, and this is one of my favorite to date. It's well-organized and covers everything the new and experienced gardener needs to grow and use healing herbs. The pictures are beautiful, and readers will appreciate the step-by-step directions. The author provides tips on the best uses for each herb and offers the perfect amount of information for readers (comprehensive but concise). The recipes include options for sprays, skin care, tinctures, teas, food, and more. Part 3 includes an in-depth look at each herb and guides readers on how to cultivate, harvest and prepare them, and the appendix gives readers a quick view of which herbs are best for specific conditions and handy conversion charts. This is a book you'll refer to again and again. Recipes I recommend: Herbal Nutri-Broth with Mushrooms, Lemon Cake Tea (under Yummy Teas), Stress Support Tincture Blend, Brain-Boosting Tincture Blend, Mellow-Me Glycerite, Bitters Spray, and Bee Balm Honey. These have been my favorite so far, but you'll want to try all of them. I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review. I love the way this book is presented, the introduction has plenty of safety advise and suggests one checks with at least three other sources the use of the herbs in this book, more to get familiar with all aspect of the plant. The book has wonderful photos and is divided into various sections such as growing, preserving, propagating and harvesting. There is information on how to make the tincture, teas, powders and much more, and these remedies can be used for stress relief, brain boosters, pain relief and many more. There are recipes just for the collecting forager and good photo of all the herbs. I went out and bought this book - excellent resource for any aspiring or actual herbalist. How to use herbs in salves, tinctures, teas, etc - basic overview on how to do that, plus herbs for different health reasons (lungs, cramps, brain, etc.) and then an in-depth look at certain herbs. Wonderful! This richly illustrated book is a must have for whoever is interested in herbs and herbal remedies. There're plenty of recipes, hints and advice. It was a really interesting read. Highly recommended! Many thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for this ARC I received a copy of this book via NetGalley and Storey Publishing and have decided to give an honest review. This book is so beautifully illustrated and contains so much helpful for information in using Herbal remedies to aid your health. I have had a long time interest in all that is natural in medicines and this book is a worthwhile look at for the beginner and the practiced herbalist. The remedies I found to be helpful to me were the Relax and Restore remedy the Sleepy Time remedy Insect Repellant and Bite Care remedy. As for the growing of my own garden if I was able to have a full garden, I would be using the helpful advise given in this book. As it is a few pots of herbs on the patio or window sill are still there when needed. I highly recommend this book. A nice introduction into making the medicine talked about and what types of healing gardens to make. Gives some recommened reading for further research and resources. A nice balance on how to grow te herbs and put them together. This is just the book I've been looking for. It's got so much information on choosing and growing herbs...and then on what you can do with them. It covers health, medicine, food flavoring, tinctures, and more. I only read about a third of the way thru this book and decided that I would be buying a hard copy of it for my reference shelves. Loved the fact that Grow Your Own Herbal Remedies read like a novel but was great at teaching at the same time. It was done well and in such a way that all audiences could enjoy it form amateur herbalists like myself to someone with ages of experience. If you are interested in herbal remedies, this is the book for you. Plenty of recopies and uses for all types of herbs. A well written and easy to follow directions on methods used. A book I will be referring to many times in the years to come. From tinctures to infused oils, this book is a reference book about herbal remedies. Maria starts from the garden about how to cultivates these marvelous herbs. Then, she shares a large collection of recipes which includes tinctures, hydrosols, infused oils and more. This is a very important book which begins by answering what to grow in your garden and why, particularly the cost-effectiveness. The author then explains the intricacies of growing, harvesting, and even preserving your herbs for maximum utilization, so that nothing is wasted. Then she explains various uses for the hers, such as in teas, various styles of tinctures, and alcohol-free extracts which use honey or vinegar, and even creating powders. She also teaches how to create salves, creams, tonics, infused oils, and poultices. This book is perfect for the person who wants to start their own herbal remedy garden, answering basically any questions you could conjure, so that you and your family can be as healthy as possible, naturally and frugally. While living in Alaska , I attended some classes given by the Cooperative Extension Office at UAF. The subject was herbal remedies specific to Alaska. I had been looking for a class in this area, (I now live in Oklahoma) but had not found one that seemed as good as the Alaskan one. This book could be used as a textbook to teach the sort of class I attended. The information provided will bring you a new awareness of the plant life around you and how you can utilize them for your health and welfare. A very interesting, useful book. I am reviewing this book 'Herbal Remedies' for Maria Noel Groves, Storey Publishing and NetGalley who gave me a copy of their book for an honest review Decided to review this as this month as we are starting to grow herbs and I had been considering how we could use them apart from in cooking. I never realised there were so many uses and simple remedies too. A great handy resource to have on hand. "}
