It is believed that each person has their own essence that is locked in a physical form \"our body\" and this way they can learn in body, mind and spirit. To be able to understand the roots of Native American traditional medicine, it is important to Harell Mitchell III Mr.Clark Ant 101 12/05/16 Aztecs and African cultures Aztec and African are two distinctive cultures with many differences. The two cultures are on different continents that are far away from each other, and there is a wide difference between the two cultures. The beliefs and practices of the people are different Many traditional Native medicines and healing practices were discouraged with the advent of Western medicine, but now there is a movement to return to traditional ways (Zubek, 1994, p. 1924). Modern Western medicine treats the symptoms to cure a diseased state when the body is out of homeostasis. Native American healing traditions do this as well with herbs and plants suited to the purpose. These Native healing traditions also include sacred rituals, chants, and purification rites to help bring the spirit and mind of the afflicted back into balance. In effect, treating the whole person, not only the disease. A blending of these two healing practices could bring about better prognoses for today's patients. The purpose of this paper is I agree with you, Hispanics do have an endless list of home remedies. I too make use of many Hispanic herbal remedies that were passed on from my mother. Some of the remedies, I believe work, while others I use for the placebo effect, nevertheless, I believe it is important to keep some of these practices alive and pass them on to our children. The great Aztec Empire, Tenochtitl\u00e1n was overpowered and taken by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. When the empire fell, many Aztecs were infected with a disease from Europe, smallpox. It was their first exposure to the disease and they had no immunity. Over a course of months, the culture and civilization of the fallen empire have changed.Numerous people wonder about the Aztecs who have survived and still remain in Tenochtitl\u00e1n. On a trip to the city, we stopped an Aztec resident on the street to answer a few questions. The resident requested to remain anonymous for safety reasons. There is a connection between the Aztecs territorial expansion, growing population and agriculture. Document A shows that the Aztecs wouldn't use some lands to use them for \"flower wars\", these wars were to gain \"flowers\" or captured sacrifice victims. Based on Document D sacrificed two-Thousand three- hundred men. Even though some of these men were treated different. Some men were treated like kings before being sacrificed. Based on Document E, this would be because after their death they would become The Native American woman interviewed has a strong holistic approach when viewing medicine compared to Western civilization. Before seeking any medical attention she states she will first try teas, herbs and other supplements in soothing common ailments. She often bakes Mesoamerica was once a place filled with expanding, ruthless empires and civilizations, although none was like the Aztecs and their empire. Although they started off with a humble beginning, they quickly grew into a great civilization that dominated present day Central Mexico. They conquered and expanded into an empire stronger than the other neighboring empires. The heart of the Aztec empire, Tenochtitlan, was a grand capital filled with many people and astounding temples. The Aztecs were also ahead of their time with fully-functional government and irrigation systems. They continue to astound many historians with their diverse way of life. They impacted the way of life for many people today with their customs and ways of life. Throughout the years, the Aztecs were able to grow and prosper with their sufficient supply of agriculture and blessed fertile lands of the Mexican Valley, and demonstrated to be an important part of Mexican heritage. The Aztec civilization was truly one of Mesoamerica's most influential empires because of their history, vibrant culture, and unique architecture. In my lesson plan, I intend to use both primary and secondary sources. For my primary sources, I plan on using Spanish and Aztec diary letters and codices. I plan on using Hernan Cortes' \"Second Letter to Emperor Charles V,\" which describes his exploits and capture of Montezuma II and the Aztec capital. This source also contains the first published detailed map of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan drawn by the Spanish. My students will be able to analyze the reasons why the Spanish captured the Aztec capital. By using the map, I also want to show my students how substantial the Aztec capital was, to illustrate how advanced this civilization was, as well as how the Spanish created a detailed map to use for strategic military purposes when they The Aztecs had many different believes and theories. This included gods, practices, and culture. This paragraph is going to be focused on the Aztec gods. There were many gods that the Aztecs believe in. There are 10 main gods. They were, Huitzilopochtli who was the main god for the Aztecs. He is the one who lead them during the migration for directions of where they should build their capital city Tenochtitlan. He is the god of the sun and war. Tlaloc who is the god of rain is associated with agriculture and fertility. Tonatiuh was the god of nourishing who provided warmth to the people. Tezcatlipoca whose name means: \"smoking mirror\". He is the god of evil power, death, and cold. Chalchiuhtlicue who was the goddess of running water and aquatic The panic in the eyes of the Aztec emperor's victim escalated hastily, making nothing comprehensible and fearing what the life ahead of him has in store. Taking advantage of each element of the human body, the most important reason for sacrificing humans was donating the blood to their god. The Aztecs utilized every resource available to them to make them a proficient and accomplished civilization. The Aztec civilization adapted their way of life in Mesoamerica to become a notorious culture; from their advanced rituals and authority they have continued their legacy to today. The Aztecs made great advances in many areas. One of their accomplishments was herbal medicine. Aztec medicine was based on two areas which are spiritual healing and herbal healing. Many of the illnesses that affected the Aztecs were caused to religious reasons: an angry god, bad My parents tell us about the fiestas de la plaza and my mom tells us stories about the santuario. Basically they tell us about their lives in Mexico and how they grew up compared to me and my brothers. I think these stories are important to tell because it makes me learned more about my parents when they were younger. Also I get to learn more in how they grew up and what lead them to come to the U.S. Although there's no stories about these practices, there are certain home remedies that have been passed down from generations for instance, we use Yerba Buena when someone is sick or has abdominal pain. Vapor rub when someone has the common cold, cough or difficultly breathing. Placing aloe Vera on sunburns. Also for coughs taking three spoons of honey with lemon for sore throat. We drink these teas that allows us to cleanse our systems and ease the pain for instance, t\u00e9 de Manzanilla (chamomile tea). Basically my parents would follow traditions that their parents have used and use it on us. I think the reason why these traditions are passed down is because my parents want us to continue using these home remedies they want us to use more natural ingredients instead of depending too much on pharmacological medicines. Also growing up I have heard some ridiculous myths or stories that my mother have said, for instance, she believes if you walk barefoot you might get sick especially when you step into the cold floor. Another believe that my parents think is that if you go outside after taking a shower and its a cold day you might get Aztec is civilization created by the ancient Indian, which was mainly distributed in central and southern Mexico. Aztecs were a tribe with a lower level of development at first, but they absorb and fuse with other outstanding cultural traditions of Indian in the region that they rose rapidly. Aztec had developed agriculture and the main crops were corn, beans, squash, potatoes. Religion played an important role in the life of the Aztecs. The inhabitants believed in the immortality of the soul and Supreme domination. They adored the natural god that one of the peculiar was to use the living person for sacrifice. Ayahuasca, a Quechuan word meaning vine of the souls, or spirits or vine of the dead, has been used in sacrament for over two millennia. There exists a retreat that can provide a new experience and deeper healing to those in need. People have attempted several different techniques, but nothing has given them the healing that they truly are desperate for. Life is a hard journey and at times people feel as they have climbed mountains only to be pushed off the other side. Getting up can be hard, but there are so many helpful resources to fit the many types of healing needs. In today's society, doctors often prescribe handfuls of medication to help in the healing process, yet for some this attempt at numbing the pain just doesn't work. Others look to a higher power for answers, and others start a pattern of self-medication that can quickly spiral out of control, therefore making things much worse. Deep in the mountains of Peru, shamans perform ceremonies for those who have tried, without relief, to heal their pain. The ceremonies involve drinking a mixture of the rare ayahuasca vine, and other plants found in Peru that contain DMT, such as "}
