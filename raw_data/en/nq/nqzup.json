Janet Jacks shares her knowledge with us to help us increase our energy and improve our detoxification! In our grandparents' day, detoxification meant clearing out internal toxins and sluggishness that had accumulated over the long winter months. Today, a yearly or twice yearly detox protocol can lower our toxic load, but the daily bombardment of man-made, external toxins may require some ongoing assistance to protect our precious health and to help the body cope. We may worry about our heart, our kidneys or our bones, but we pay rare attention to one of the most important organs of all...the liver. Perhaps that is because an overworked liver (which today's environment too easily creates) may produce only a few vague symptoms that we do not directly link to the liver, such as fatigue, constipation, or emotional distress. Yet, the liver is the central clearing house of the body, responsible not only for removing toxins from the bloodstream, but also for 'packaging up' these toxins so that they can be effectively -- and safely -- removed from the body (i.e. stage 1 and stage 2 of the detox cycle). To do this, the liver needs our ongoing help. The liver is a dome shaped gland - the largest in the body - that sits at the lower edge of the right rib cage. It's constantly bombarded with toxic chemicals coming not only from within but also especially from the environment: from medications, chemicals from food, fumes or cleaning products, hormones (including our own), and by-products of metabolism. Our body cannot functionwithout a liver. It filters almost two litres of blood per minute. And, if the bowel is not eliminating toxins at least daily, then these are re-absorbed into the blood, putting a yet larger burden on the liver, so supporting the other detox pathways of the body, including the GI tract, supports the liver as well. We have an incredible opportunity to protect our bodies, lower our risk of disease, and boost our energy, all at the same time! Diet, herbs and other gentle remedies cleanse and strengthen the liver, and that in turn lowers our toxic burden. Here are some easy and important helps for the liver that you can incorporate into your daily routine: Improve your diet, adopt new habits, add in several of these cleansing herbs, and create an internal environment conducive to rejuvenation and health. Your risk of disease will diminish, and your energy will increase.
