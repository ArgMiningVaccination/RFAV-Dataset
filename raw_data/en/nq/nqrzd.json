The blood delivers oxygen and nutrients around your body and takes away carbon dioxide and waste products. The heart is divided into 4 chambers - 2 on the right and 2 on the left: The 2 smaller upper chambers collect blood going into the heart. These chambers are called the right atrium and the left atrium. The 2 larger lower chambers pump blood out of the heart. These chambers are called the right ventricle and the left ventricle. There are 4 valves inside the heart. They open and close as the heart pumps blood. The valves keep the blood flowing in one direction through the heart. Blood travels around the body through tubes called blood vessels. The blood going to the heart is low in oxygen. It travels through the heart and is pumped out to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen and gets rid of carbon dioxide, which is then breathed out. The blood carrying oxygen travels back through the heart and is pumped out to the body again.The heart and heart problems 7 The inside of the heart Right atrium Valve Right ventricleLeft ventricleValveLeft atrium8 Heart health and cancer treatment The outside of the heart Lower bodyLungs LungsUpper body Key Blood that has oxygen Blood that needs oxygenCoronary arteries Heart muscleThe heart and heart problems 9 Like the rest of your body, the heart needs its own blood supply to bring it oxygen. Small blood vessels on the outside of the heart carry blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. These blood vessels are called coronary arteries (see the diagram on the opposite page). The heart has its own electrical system that tells it when to beat and pump blood around the body. A group of cells called the sinus node send an electrical signal through the heart to start each beat. This happens about 60 to 100 times a minute. The sinus node is also known as the heart's natural pacemaker.10 Heart health and cancer treatment Heart problems Problems can happen when parts of the heart become diseased or damaged. Coronary heart disease (CHD) Coronary arteries are the small blood vessels that carry blood and oxygen to the heart muscle (see the diagram on page 8). Sometimes, fatty deposits (called atheroma) can build up inside the arteries. This can make the arteries narrow and is called coronary heart disease (CHD) or coronary artery disease. A normal artery and a narrowed artery Normal blood flow Abnormal blood flowArtery wall Fatty depositThe heart and heart problems 11 Certain things, called risk factors can increase the risk of CHD. These include: smoking being overweight high blood pressure a high blood cholesterol level diabetes a lack of exercise age - you are more likely to develop CHD as you get older a family history of CHD some cancer treatments. The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to develop CHD. We have more information about risk factors on pages 19 to 25.12 Heart health and cancer treatment Symptoms of CHD Sometimes a blood vessel gets so narrow that it does not let enough blood and oxygen flow to the heart muscle. This can cause symptoms. The main symptom of CHD is chest pain or discomfort, known as angina. Angina often feels like a heaviness or tightness in your chest. Some people describe a feeling of: a dull ache - a bit like indigestion severe tightness. The pain and discomfort may spread to your arms, neck, jaw or stomach. Other symptoms of CHD include: feeling short of breath extreme tiredness (fatigue) on physical exertion. These symptoms often develop when you are physically active, exercising or stressed. They may also develop after a meal, or in cold weather. Symptoms usually go away when you rest and relax.Philippa'I started feeling breathless after chemotherapy. One time I drove to hospital for my appointment and when I got out of the car, I was struggling to breathe.'14 Heart health and cancer treatment Heart attacks Sometimes a piece of fatty deposit can break off and a blood clot forms. This may block the blood vessel, stopping the flow of blood to parts of the heart. This is called a heart attack. It can cause permanent damage to the heart muscle. The symptoms of a heart attack vary from person to person. The most common sign is sudden pain or discomfort in your chest that does not go away. For some people, the pain is severe. Other people just feel uncomfortable. Sometimes the chest pain or discomfort: feels like tightness, heaviness or burning in your chest may spread to the arms, neck, jaw, stomach or back. You may also: feel sweaty feel dizzy or light-headed be short of breath feel sick or vomit feel generally unwell. If you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, call 999 immediately for an ambulance.The heart and heart problems 15 Heart muscle damage Damage to the heart muscle can make it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. The most common reasons for heart muscle damage are: a heart attack high blood pressure heart muscle disease, which is also called cardiomyopathy problems with the heart valves or rhythm being born with a heart problem (congenital heart disease) some infections using recreational drugs or excessive alcohol some cancer treatments. Heart failure Damage to the heart muscle can lead to heart failure. This does not mean that the heart stops. It just means that it does not pump blood around the body as well as usual. Symptoms of heart failure can include: feeling short of breath, when you are physically active, or at rest feeling unusually tired or weak (fatigue) swollen feet, ankles, legs or tummy (abdomen).16 Heart health and cancer treatment Heart valve disease The heart valves can become stiff and not open properly. Or they may not close tightly and the blood may leak backwards. The main causes of heart valve disease are: infection damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) being born with an abnormal heart valve (congenital heart valve disease) getting older radiotherapy to the heart or nearby areas. You may not have any symptoms, but the main symptoms of heart valve disease are: feeling unusually tired feeling short of breath swelling of the legs, feet and ankles. If valve problems are not treated it can put a strain on the heart. This can sometimes lead to heart failure over time.The heart and heart problems 17 Electrical heart problems A problem with the heart's electrical system may make your heart beat: too fast too slow with an irregular pattern. This is different to the normal changes in heart rhythm that can happen during the day. For example, your heart may beat slower when you are resting, and faster when you are active or feeling anxious. An abnormal heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia . There are many reasons why someone may have an abnormal heart rhythm. It is more common in older people or people who already have a heart condition. Some cancer treatments can also affect the electrical system and how the heart beats. Many people have palpitations from time to time. This is the sensation of feeling your heart beating. It may feel like your heart is: fluttering pounding beating too fast, too slow or irregularly skipping a beat. For most people palpitations are harmless and do not mean anything is wrong with your heart. But sometimes it can be a sign of a problem.18 Heart health and cancer treatment Symptoms of arrhythmia Some arrhythmias are more serious than others. The symptoms depend on the type of arrhythmia you have. The most common symptoms include: palpitations feeling dizzy breathlessness blackouts (fainting).The heart and heart problems 19 Risk factors for heart problems Risk factors are things that can make you more likely to develop certain heart problems. Some risk factors cannot be changed. You can control other risk factors by making changes to your lifestyle or by taking medicines. If you are worried about any of these risk factors, talk to your GP or nurse. They can give you information about your risk of future heart problems and advice about reducing this risk. You can also find out more about risk factors on the British Heart Foundation website at bhf.org.uk Risk factors you cannot control There are some risk factors that you cannot change. Age As your body gets older, you are more likely to develop coronary heart disease (CHD) or have a heart attack (see pages 10 to 14). Family history Some heart problems can run in families. You have a higher risk if your parents, brothers or sisters have had heart problems. Ethnicity People in the UK who come from a South Asian background, may have a higher risk of developing CHD than the rest of the UK population. CHD can lead to a heart attack. You are also more likely to have diabetes, which is another risk factor for heart problems.20 Heart health and cancer treatment If you are from an African Caribbean background, you are more likely to have other risk factors. These include high blood pressure and diabetes. Risk factors you can control There are some risk factors that you can control by changing your lifestyle (see pages 72 to 87) or with medicines from your doctor (see pages 59 to 63). This lowers your chance of developing CHD or having a heart attack. Even if you already have a heart problem, you can help your heart by controlling these factors. Smoking Smoking increases your risk of CHD or a heart attack in several ways: It damages the lining of your coronary arteries, which can lead to a build-up of fatty deposits (atheroma). It reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood. This means your heart has to work harder to supply the body with enough oxygen. It makes your blood more likely to clot. This increases your risk of a heart attack or stroke. It makes your heart beat faster and work harder.The heart and heart problems 21 Weight and body shape If you are overweight or carry more weight around your waist, you have a higher risk of developing CHD. You are also more likely to develop conditions that can cause heart problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. You can check whether you are a healthy weight and body shape in two ways. Body Mass Index (BMI) BMI is a measure of whether your weight is healthy for your height. The table below shows how BMI can check if you are underweight, a healthy weight or overweight. Your GP or practice nurse can tell you what your BMI is. Or you can check it online using a BMI calculator. Visit bhf.org.uk/bmi BMI Weight Less than 18.5 Underweight 18.5 to 24.9 Healthy weight 25 to 29.9 Overweight 30 or more Very overweight22 Heart health and cancer treatment Waist measurement Whatever your height or weight, having too much fat around the middle of your body increases your risk of heart problems. You can measure your waist by placing a tape measure halfway between your lowest rib and the top of your hip bone. For most people, this will be at the level of their tummy button. You can check if your waist measurement is putting your health at risk on the British Heart Foundation's website. Visit bhf.org.uk A healthy waist measurement varies depending on your ethnic group. For people of white European heritage: Women have an increased risk if their waist measures more than 80 cm (31.5 inches). The risk is severe if it measures over 88 cm (35 inches). Men have an increased risk if their waist measures more than 94 cm (37 inches). The risk is severe if it measures over 102 cm (40 inches). People of South Asian, African-Caribbean, Black African, Chinese and Middle Eastern heritage have a greater risk of heart problems at a lower waist measurement: For women, the risk is severe if their waist measures more than 80 cm (31.5 inches). For men, the risk is severe if their waist measures more than 90 cm (35.5 inches).The heart and heart problems 23 Physical activity People who spend more time sitting or being inactive have a higher risk of developing CHD, high blood pressure and diabetes. Regular activity helps to keep your heart healthier. It can: lower your cholesterol keep your blood pressure at a healthy level help control your diabetes. We have more information on pages 77 to 82. You may also find our booklet Physical activity and cancer helpful (see page 104). High blood pressure Blood pressure measures the pressure of your blood as your heart pumps it out to your body. If the pressure is high it can damage the arteries. This increases the risk of a heart attack or stroke. High blood pressure can also damage the heart muscle which can lead to heart failure. You can improve your blood pressure by: being more physically active losing weight reducing the salt in your diet eating more fresh fruit and vegetables drinking less than 14 units of alcohol each week and not drinking alcohol for several days each week. Your doctor may also give you medicines to help control your blood pressure.24 Heart health and cancer treatment High cholesterol Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in the blood. If there is too much cholesterol, fatty material can build up in the artery walls. This can increase the risk of CHD and heart attack. You can improve your cholesterol level by: eating a healthy diet - choosing unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats (see pages 74 to 75) stopping smoking being more physically active keeping to a healthy weight and waist measurement. Your doctor may also give you medicines to lower your cholesterol levels.The heart and heart problems 25 Diabetes Diabetes is a condition where the level of sugar in the blood is too high. There are two main types: Type 1 diabetes is rare. It is more common in children or young adults. This type of diabetes is not related to diet or lifestyle. It is treated with insulin by injection or through a pump. Type 2 diabetes is more common and usually affects adults over the age of 40. This type is much more likely if you are overweight or physically inactive. It is treated with a healthy diet and physical activity. Tablets and insulin can also help manage it. Over time, diabetes can damage the heart and blood vessels. This can increase the risk of high blood pressure and coronary heart disease (see ages 10 to 14). If you have diabetes, keeping your blood sugar under control will help reduce your risk of heart problems. Your doctor or nurse can give you more advice about this. You may also find our booklet Diabetes and cancer treatment helpful (see page 104).

This may cause heart problems that are either short-term (temporary) or long-term (permanent). Problems may develop during or soon after cancer treatment. Some problems may develop many years later. These are called late effects. The risk of heart problems depends on: the type of cancer treatment you have how much treatment you have. Your risk may be higher if: you have other risk factors for heart problems (see pages 19 to 25) you had a heart problem before starting cancer treatment (see pages 10 to 18) you have several cancer treatments at the same time. Your cancer doctor will explain if a cancer treatment is likely to affect your heart. If you are worried about heart problems, ask them for more information. If your treatment has finished and you are worried about your heart, talk to your GP. Sometimes it is hard to remember the details of your cancer treatment. Your cancer doctor or your GP can give you more information and answer any questions you have.Cancer treatment and your heart 29 If you had cancer treatment as a child, you may have a higher risk of developing heart problems as an adult. This depends on the type of cancer treatment you had. Some people will have regular follow-up appointments for the rest of their life to check their heart health. We have more information about late effects of cancer treatment on our website (see page 104). Your data and the cancer registry When you are diagnosed with cancer in the UK, some information about you, your cancer diagnosis and your treatment is collected in a cancer registry. This is used to plan and improve health and care services. Your hospital will usually give this information to the registry automatically. There are strict rules to make sure the information is kept safely and securely. It will only be used for your direct care or for health and social care planning and research. Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions. If you do not want your information included in the registry, you can contact the cancer registry in your country to opt out. You can find more information at macmillan.org.uk/cancerregistry30 Heart health and cancer treatment Chemotherapy Some types of chemotherapy may cause heart problems. The risk can be higher if you are: taking several chemotherapy drugs together having chemotherapy with chest radiotherapy also having some types of targeted therapies. Your age when you have chemotherapy may also increase the risk of heart problems. With some types of chemotherapy the risk of a heart problem is increased in: young children people over 65 years old. Your cancer doctor will explain any risks before you start chemotherapy. Different drugs can cause different problems: Some drugs are only likely to cause heart problems if you have a high dose. Your cancer doctor will plan your treatment carefully and record the doses you are given. Some drugs may cause heart changes during or shortly after you have treatment. Some drugs can cause heart problems many years later - these are known as late effects (see pages 28 to 29). Some chemotherapy drugs are given into a vein (intravenously) with large amounts of fluid. If you already have a heart condition, this can put pressure on your heart and may cause problems. Your nurse will monitor you for any signs of problems while you have these treatments.Cancer treatment and your heart 31 Before treatment, you may have blood tests and a scan to monitor how your heart is working. For some types of chemotherapy, you will have these tests again during and after your treatment. These tests look for early signs of heart muscle damage and monitor your heart function. You may not have any symptoms, but it is important to treat early signs to stop further damage. We have more information about tests on pages 50 to 58. Sometimes chemotherapy causes symptoms that need urgent treatment to prevent serious problems. You should tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you: have chest tightness, pain or discomfort have pain that spreads to your shoulders, neck, back, jaw or arms feel unwell, sick or sweaty have shortness of breath or are wheezing black out (faint) feel dizzy or light-headed can feel your heart beating (palpitations). If you get any of these symptoms during treatment, your doctors will stop the chemotherapy drug and check your heart. They may change the type of chemotherapy to one that does not cause heart problems. We have more information about different chemotherapy drugs on our website. You may also find our booklet Understanding chemotherapy helpful (see page 104).32 Heart health and cancer treatment Anthracyclines Anthracyclines are a group of chemotherapy drugs that most commonly affect the heart. They are used to treat many different types of cancer. This type of chemotherapy includes the drugs: doxorubicin, which is also called Adriamycin\u00ae epirubicin daunorubicin idarubicin mitoxantrone. Many people who have these drugs do not develop any heart problems. But sometimes they can cause heart muscle damage. This can cause symptoms during, shortly after or years after treatment (late effects). To help reduce the risk of heart problems, doxorubicin can be wrapped in a fatty covering called a liposome. The liposome helps prevent the drug from reaching areas with small blood vessels, such as the heart. This treatment is called liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx\u00ae, Myocet\u00ae). Your cancer doctor can tell you if it is suitable for you. Other chemotherapy drugs Sometimes other types of chemotherapy drugs can affect the heart. A small number of people may develop heart problems. These may develop within hours or up to a few days after having these treatments.Cancer treatment and your heart 33 Alkylating agents Alkylating agents are used to treat many different types of cancer. Commonly used alkylating agents include: cyclophosphamide carmustine ifosfamide. Taxanes These are used to treat different types of cancer including ovary, breast, prostate and lung cancer. The 2 main taxanes are: paclitaxel docetaxel. Fluoropyrimidines These chemotherapy drugs are used to treat different cancers, such as bowel and breast cancer. Commonly used fluoropyrimidines include: fluorouracil (5FU) capecitabine. Other commonly used chemotherapy drugs can also affect the heart. But the risk of heart problems with these drugs is small. They include: bleomycin cisplatin fludarabine gemcitabine mitomycin. We have more information about chemotherapy drugs on our website (see page 104).34 Heart health and cancer treatment Targeted therapies Targeted therapy drugs are used to treat many different cancers. There are different types of targeted therapy. Some of them can affect the heart. Different drugs can cause different heart problems (see pages 10 to 18). Some may cause high blood pressure or abnormal heart rhythms. Others can cause symptoms of angina or heart failure. Researchers are still looking at the effect some newer drugs have on heart health. Before treatment, you may have blood tests and scans to monitor how your heart is working (see pages 50 to 58). For some types of targeted therapy, you will have these tests again during and after your treatment. This is done to look for early signs of heart muscle damage. You may not have any symptoms, but it is important to monitor your heart. This is so that any early signs can be treated to stop further damage. There are many different targeted therapy drugs. Over the next few pages are examples of the different types of targeted therapy drugs that may affect the heart. Your cancer doctor, specialist nurse or pharmacist will talk to you about the drug you are having. They will explain any risks before you start treatment. We have more information about targeted therapies and many of the different targeted therapy drugs on our website (see page 104).Cancer treatment and your heart 35 Cancer growth inhibitors Chemical signals tell cells in the body how and when to develop and divide. Cancer growth inhibitors are treatments that make it difficult for cancer cells to receive these signals. Cancer growth inhibitors that can affect the a blood supply to be able to survive. Without a good blood supply, the tumour does not get the oxygen and nutrients it needs. This may slow the tumour's growth or sometimes shrink it. Angiogenesis inhibitors block the chemical signals cells use to make blood vessels grow. This makes it difficult for a tumour to develop the network of blood vessels it needs to get a blood supply. Angiogenesis inhibitors that can affect the heart include: bevacizumab everolimus.36 Heart health and cancer treatment Checkpoint inhibitors Checkpoint inhibitors affect a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte. Lymphocytes are an important part of the immune system. When they are active, they can attack another cell such as a cancer cell. Checkpoint inhibitors block the signals that 'switch off' lymphocytes. This means the lymphocyte stays active and is able to attack the cancer cells. Some checkpoint inhibitors can cause inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) and arrhythmias. Checkpoint inhibitors that can affect the heart include: nivolumab pembrolizumab.Cancer treatment and your heart 37 Immune system modulators Immune system modulators help the immune system work better. Examples that may affect the heart function include: lenalidomide pomalidomide thalidomide. Proteasome inhibitors Proteasome inhibitors interfere with enzymes (proteasomes) that are found in all cells, including cancer cells. This may cause the cancer cells to die and can stop them from growing. Proteasome inhibitors that can affect heart function include: carfilzomib bortezomib ixazomib.38 Heart health and cancer treatment Radiotherapy Most people who have radiotherapy do not develop heart problems after treatment. Radiotherapy is only likely to cause heart problems if the heart is in the area being treated. For example, this could be if you have radiotherapy for breast cancer in the left breast. If you have radiotherapy to another part of your body, away from the heart, it is unlikely to damage the heart. Radiotherapy techniques are very accurate. Treatment can usually be planned to avoid affecting the heart. This means heart problems after radiotherapy have become rare. Radiotherapy to the heart can: affect the coronary arteries, which can lead to coronary heart disease cause inflammation of the layers that cover of the heart (pericarditis) cause a build-up of fluid between the layers that cover the heart (pericardial effusion) damage the heart muscle damage the heart valves affect the heart's electrical system and cause an abnormal rhythm. The risk of damage to the heart depends on: the total dose of radiotherapy given how much of the heart is in the treatment area.Cancer treatment and your heart 39 The higher the overall dose of radiotherapy and the amount of the heart exposed, the greater the risk of damage. But the risk is still very small. The risk of heart damage is also increased if: you are having chemotherapy at the same time you already have a heart condition. After radiotherapy Heart problems can sometimes happen during treatment. Or they may develop months or years later (late effects). If you were told the radiotherapy may affect your heart, you can reduce the risk by making healthy lifestyle choices (see pages 72 to 87). Your GP may arrange regular appointments after cancer treatment to check for signs of heart problems. At the appointments, you may have: your blood pressure checked a blood test to check your cholesterol levels scans to check how your heart is working. If you notice any warning signs of heart problems (see page 86), tell a doctor as soon as possible. 40 Heart health and cancer treatment Hormonal therapies These drugs are often used to treat breast cancer or prostate cancer. Sometimes they are used to treat other types of cancer. Hormonal therapies do not usually damage the heart directly, but they can affect your risk factors for heart problems. They may raise your blood pressure or cholesterol levels. People also tend to gain weight while taking hormonal therapies. This can increase your risk of developing diabetes and heart problems in the future. Women taking hormonal therapies may have an early menopause. The risk of heart problems increases in women after the menopause. If you are taking a hormonal therapy, you can reduce these risks by making healthy lifestyle changes (see pages 72 to 87). Your doctor may also suggest treatments for high blood pressure or high cholesterol. We have more information about hormonal therapy drugs on our website (see page 104).42 Heart health and cancer treatment Surgery Surgery is one of the main treatments for cancer. Sometimes surgery can put the heart under stress and cause heart problems. Having drugs to keep you asleep during surgery (general anaesthetic) may also cause heart problems for some people. If you have a healthy heart, surgery is not usually a problem. But there may be a higher risk of damage to the heart for people who: had heart problems before surgery have diabetes are over 70 years old have high blood pressure smoke are overweight. If you have minor surgery and only need to be asleep (anaesthetised) for a short time, the risk may be small. If you have major surgery and need to be asleep for several hours, the risk can be greater. Your doctor will talk to you about the possible risks of your surgery. Before you have a general anaesthetic, you will have some tests. These are to check your heart and make sure you are fit enough for surgery. If you have a high risk of serious heart problems, your doctors may suggest other cancer treatments you can have.Cancer treatment and your heart 43 Cancer research trials (clinical trials) Your cancer doctor may talk to you about having cancer treatment as part of a clinical trial. Clinical trials test new treatments or new ways of giving treatments. Before you decide if you want to take part, your doctor or a clinical researcher will explain the trial. They will give you information about any known side effects of the treatment. They may not know all the effects these treatments have on the heart. If you join the trial, you will be monitored closely for side effects. If you develop any warning signs of heart problems (see page 86), tell a doctor or nurse straight away. We have more information about clinical trials in our booklet Understanding cancer research trials (clinical trials) . See page 104.Philippa'My heart nurse has always been a great support.'Planning cancer treatment 46 If you already have a heart problem 48 Tests to check heart health 50 If heart problems develop 59 After cancer treatment 67Having treat me n T for canC er46 Heart health and cancer treatment Planning cancer treatment Before you have cancer treatment, your cancer doctor will explain your treatment plan. They will tell you about any possible benefits and disadvantages of the treatment, including any possible risks to your heart. Your cancer doctor may check your heart health. They will ask whether you have any heart problems or risk factors such as: high blood pressure high cholesterol diabetes (see page 25). They will ask what treatments you have had or are having for these conditions. If you are not sure or cannot remember the name of a condition or treatment, check your medical notes. Your cancer doctor might also speak to your GP or cardiologist (heart doctor). You may also have tests to check your heart health (see pages 50 to 58). For some cancer treatments, you may have these tests even if you do not have heart problems. Tests can be repeated during and after treatment to check for any heart changes. ' Before surgery I had a pre-op visit to the hospital and had an electrocardiogram as part of that. It was very routine. A few days later, I was told my results were unusual and that people with a heartbeat pattern like mine usually have a pacemaker.' JudithHaving treatment for cancer 47 Making your decision Making a decision about your cancer treatment can be complicated. For many people, the possible benefits of cancer treatment are greater than the risk of possible heart problems later in life. But it is your decision. Your doctor and nurse will help you understand the benefits and risks of having treatment. It is important to understand this information before you decide what is right for you. You might find it helps to make a list of the questions you want to ask. Some people take a relative or friend with them. This may help you remember what was said. You will normally have time to think about your decision, and another appointment with your doctor or nurse to discuss it. We have further information to help you make your decision in our booklet Making treatment decisions (see page 104). 'My team gave me the best information to help me make my decision. They explained everything in a way I could understand. My cardiologist didn't become part of the team treating the cancer, but they did exchange emails about my situation.' Judith48 Heart health and cancer treatment If you already have a heart problem Not all cancer treatments are suitable for people with heart problems. But this can depend on the type of heart problem and how well-controlled it is. Your cancer doctor will talk to you about this. If a cancer treatment is likely to cause serious problems, they may suggest a different type of treatment. If you are having a cancer treatment that might make a heart problem worse, you may need: heart tests before, during or after cancer treatment other treatments to control the heart problem. You might need to go to extra appointments before cancer treatment starts. Your cancer doctor may arrange for you to see your cardiologist (heart doctor) for specialist advice about the heart problem. If this delays your cancer treatment, you may feel frustrated or worried. But it is important to get the right information, treatment and advice. This way, you can have the cancer treatment as safely as possible. You may find it helpful to: know who to contact if you have a question about your cancer treatment, heart problems or test results check what will happen next at the end of each appointment speak to your specialist doctors, GP or nurse specialist about any worries you have - they should have access to your test results and medical notes.Having treatment for cancer 49 If you have an implanted electronic device Some people have an electrical device placed under the skin near the heart. It is used to treat abnormal heart rhythms. These are: pacemakers implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Radiotherapy and some types of scans can affect how these devices work. So it is important to tell your healthcare team if you have one. They will plan any scans and treatment to avoid affecting your device. They will also arrange any extra monitoring you need to check your device or adjust its settings. 'As well as visiting the hospital for treatment, they had to check my pacemaker was still working. That meant extra visits to a different hospital when I had radiotherapy.' Judith50 Heart health and cancer treatment Tests to check heart health Your doctors may use different tests to check how well your heart is working before, during and after your cancer treatment. How often you have tests depends on the type of treatment and whether you already have heart problems. Your cancer doctor or nurse will explain any tests that you need. Some people find it helpful to have a relative or friend come with them to the test. You can find more information and videos of people having heart tests on the British Heart Foundation website. Visit bhf.org.uk/ informationsupport/tests Blood tests Blood tests help check how well your heart is working. They are also used to monitor the effects of any heart medicines you take. The most common blood tests used to check heart health are: Cardiac enzyme tests (including troponin test) - These can help show whether your heart muscle has been damaged. Natriuretic peptide tests (BNP or NT-proBNP) - These can help show whether you have heart failure. A high level may be a sign of heart failure. If the level is high, you will need further tests such as a heart ultrasound (an echocardiogram). Urea and electrolytes (U&E) tests - These give information about the levels of sodium and potassium in your blood. Sodium and potassium are important for the function of your heart. U&Es also show how well your kidneys are working. Your kidneys may be affected by any medicines you are taking.Having treatment for cancer 51 Full blood count (FBC) - This test measures the number of different types of blood cells in your blood - red cells, white cells and platelets. It also measures the level of haemoglobin (Hb) in your blood. Haemoglobin carries oxygen around the body. Cholesterol blood tests - Having too much cholesterol in your blood increases the risk of heart problems. If your cholesterol level is high, you can make changes to your lifestyle that can help reduce it. Your doctor may also suggest that you take a cholesterol-lowering medicine. Electrocardiogram (ECG) This test: records the electrical activity of the heart measures the heart's rate and rhythm detects heart rhythm problems sometimes shows if someone has had a heart attack in the past can show if the heart is enlarged or thickened. Small sticky pads (electrodes) are placed on your chest, arms and legs. Wires connect the pads to an ECG recording machine. This picks up the electrical signals that make your heart beat. The electrical activity is recorded and printed on paper. The test takes about five minutes and is painless. You need to lie still during the ECG, as moving can affect the results.52 Heart health and cancer treatment 24-hour ECG An ECG can also be recorded over 24 to 48 hours. This is also called Holter monitoring or ambulatory ECG monitoring. You have electrodes put on your chest. The wires attached to these will be taped down. The wires go under your clothes to a small portable recorder on a belt around your waist. While you are wearing the ECG recorder, you can do everything you would normally do except have a bath or shower. When the test is finished, you return the recorder to the hospital. Your doctor will check the results. Exercise ECG The aim of this test is to see how your heart works when you are more active. It is sometimes called a stress test. An ECG is recorded while you are walking on a treadmill or cycling on an exercise bike. An exercise ECGHaving treatment for cancer 53 Angiogram This test: looks inside your coronary arteries to find out if any of them are narrowed, and how severe the narrowing is gives information about how effectively your heart is pumping gives information about the blood pressure inside your heart. You will be asked not to eat or drink anything for several hours before your angiogram. You will have a local anaesthetic injection to numb the skin in your groin or on your arm. The doctor then makes a small cut. They insert a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into an artery. Using x-ray, the catheter is guided to the heart. The doctor will inject dye into the catheter and take x-rays. You might feel a hot, flushing sensation from the dye. Tell your doctor if you feel uncomfortable or unwell at any time.54 Heart health and cancer treatment Ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) An echocardiogram (echo) uses sound waves to build up a detailed picture of your heart. It is like the ultrasound scan used during pregnancy. It gives information about: the structure of the heart the heart valves how well the heart is pumping. You will be asked to lie down. When you are comfortable, some gel is rubbed on your chest. A probe is then placed over different areas of your chest. This probe gives off pulses of sound waves, which echo against the structures of the heart. These echoes are picked up by the probe. They are shown as pictures on the screen of the echo machine. An echocardiogramHaving treatment for cancer 55 The test can take from 15 to 60 minutes. It is painless, but it may cause some discomfort if you have had recent surgery on your chest. Your doctor can give you painkillers to help with this. Trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) Some people will have a trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE). This test takes more detailed pictures of the heart from inside the gullet (oesophagus). The gullet is the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. It lies behind your heart. This means a TOE can get a closer and clearer picture of the heart valves. Before you have a TOE, you may be given drugs to make you feel sleepy (sedation). Your doctor will gently pass a small, flexible ultrasound probe through your mouth and into the throat. You will then be asked to swallow. The test usually takes around 20 minutes. It can feel uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. You can usually go home after the sedation has worn off. CT scan A CT scan takes a series of x-rays, which build up a three -dimensional picture of the inside of the body. It can be used to look at the structure and the pumping action of your heart. A CT coronary angiogram is a type of CT scan that helps show the blood flow through the coronary arteries. Before a CT scan, you may be given a tablet or injection of a drug that slows your heartbeat slightly. A slower heartbeat makes it easier to get clear scans. You will also have a dye injected into a vein in your arm. This dye helps show how blood is moving through the heart.56 Heart health and cancer treatment You lie on a bed which is moved inside the scanner. The scanner is shaped like a large doughnut. A small amount of radiation is used during a CT scan. If you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before having this test. Cardiac MRI scan (CMR) An MRI scan uses magnetism to build up detailed pictures of areas of your body. A cardiac MRI scan gives information about: the structure of the heart the heart valves how well the heart is pumping. The scanner is a powerful magnet, so you may be asked to complete and sign a checklist to make sure it is safe for you. The checklist asks about any metal implants you may have. These could include a pacemaker, surgical clips, bone pins, artificial joints or artificial heart valves, nerve stimulators or a cochlear implant. It is safe to have an MRI if you have coronary stents in place. You should also tell your doctor if you have ever worked with metal or in the metal industry. This is because very tiny fragments of metal can sometimes lodge in the body. Having metal in your body does not always mean you cannot have an MRI scan. Your doctor and radiographer will decide if the MRI scan is safe for you. If you are not able to have an MRI scan, another type of scan can be used. Some tattoo ink contains traces of metal. Most tattoos are safe. But tell the radiographer immediately if you feel any discomfort or heat in your tattoo during the MRI scan.Having treatment for cancer 57 Before the scan, you will be asked to remove any metal belongings including jewellery. For some cardiac MRIs, the doctor will inject a dye into a vein in the arm. This does not usually cause discomfort. The dye helps to give a clearer picture of the heart muscle and the blood flow through and around the heart. Your doctor can tell you more about this. During the test you will lie very still on a couch inside a long cylinder (tube) for up to an hour. It is painless but can be slightly uncomfortable, and some people feel a bit claustrophobic. If you are worried about this, tell your doctor before having the scan. You may be offered a mild sedative drug to help you relax. The scanner is also noisy, but you will be given earplugs or headphones. You can hear, and speak to, the person operating the scanner. Myocardial perfusion scan This scan shows how well the heart is pumping and looks at the flow of blood to the heart muscle. It may be used to check for heart changes caused by some types of chemotherapy or targeted therapy treatment. During the scan, your doctor will give you an injection of a small amount of radioactive dye. A special camera then takes images of your heart. This measures how the dye is pumped through your heart. The scan may be done while you are resting and during exercise on a treadmill or exercise bike. You may be asked to avoid close contact with children and pregnant women for a few hours after. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, talk to your doctor before having this test.58 Heart health and cancer treatment 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor Some cancer drugs can cause high blood pressure. Your cancer doctor or nurse will check your blood pressure regularly. But sometimes they may want to monitor it over a longer time. This can be done with a portable (ambulatory) blood pressure monitor. You wear it for 24 hours while you continue most of your normal routines. You should not have a bath or shower. A blood pressure cuff (a band) is wrapped around your upper arm. A tube goes from the cuff, under your clothes, to a small monitor on a belt around your waist. The cuff inflates around your arm and records your blood pressure. It does this automatically at regular times. For example, it could happen every 30 minutes during the day and every hour at night. The monitor records your blood pressure measurements and the time they were taken. After 24 hours, the monitor is removed. The information is collected for your doctor to check.Having treatment for cancer 59 If heart problems develop If you develop heart problems during or after cancer treatment, your doctors will talk to you about the best way to manage them. Heart problems are often treated with medicines. Some conditions are treated with a heart procedure or surgery. Your cancer doctor may arrange for you to see a heart doctor (cardiologist) for advice. Some heart problems will be managed and monitored by your GP. If you are having cancer treatment when the heart problem starts, your cancer doctor may suggest changing your treatment to prevent further damage. These changes may include: stopping cancer treatment for a time lowering the dose changing to a different treatment that is less likely to cause heart problems stopping cancer treatment completely. Heart medicines Medicines are often used to treat heart problems. They may also be used to help protect your heart during cancer treatment. Your doctor or pharmacist can give you more information about your heart medicines. You can also get more detailed information from the British Heart Foundation. Visit bhf.org.uk/medicines'My nurse explained everything. She has been fantastic.' PhilippaHaving treatment for cancer 61 ACE inhibitors ACE inhibitors make your blood vessels relax and widen. This reduces the amount of work your heart has to do and can also lower your blood pressure. So, ACE inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. They are also used after a heart attack. Examples are enalapril, ramipril and lisinopril. Angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) ARBs work in a similar way to ACE inhibitors. They relax and widen your blood vessels. They are used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. They are also used after a heart attack. Examples are candesartan, losartan and valsartan. Beta blockers Beta blockers work by slowing your heart rate, which means your heart has less work to do. They can help control angina and reduce the risk of a heart attack in people who have already had one. They can also be used to treat abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure and high blood pressure. Examples are carvedilol, bisoprolol and atenolol. Calcium channel blockers These medicines reduce the amount of calcium entering the cells in the heart muscle and blood vessel walls. Calcium is needed to make the muscles and vessels contract. If there is less calcium the heart muscle and blood vessels relax. This can help lower blood pressure and treat angina. Examples are amlodipine and diltiazem.62 Heart health and cancer treatment Cholesterol-lowering medicines (statins) These medicines reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood. This can reduce your risk of coronary heart disease, heart attack and stroke. Examples are simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Diuretics (water tablets) Diuretics encourage the kidneys to make more urine, which is then passed out of the body. This reduces the amount of fluid and salts in the body, which can reduce the pressure on the heart muscle. Diuretics are used to treat heart failure and high blood pressure. There are different types of diuretics which work in slightly different ways. Your doctor or pharmacist can tell you more about the type of diuretic you are taking. Examples are bumetanide and furosemide. Anti-platelet medicines Platelets are cells in your blood that form clots to help stop bleeding. Anti-platelet medicines help to make the blood less sticky and reduce the risk of clots forming. People who have a higher risk of heart attack or stroke may be given an anti-platelet medicine to help reduce the risk. This includes people with coronary heart disease, angina, or people who have had a previous heart attack or stroke. Some types of chemotherapy may cause a low level of platelets in your blood. If this happens, your cardiologist and cancer doctor may suggest stopping the anti-platelet medicine for a time. You will have regular blood tests to check your platelet levels. Examples are aspirin and clopidogrel.Having treatment for cancer 63 Anticoagulants Anticoagulants prevent harmful blood clots from forming, which can reduce the risk of a stroke. They are most commonly prescribed for people who have certain abnormal heart rhythms, or who have an artificial heart valve. Examples are warfarin, apixiban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban. Nitrates Nitrates are used to treat angina. They relax the muscles in the walls of the coronary arteries. This improves the amount of blood that is supplied to the heart. Examples are glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and isosorbide mononitrate. 'I had to deal with my heart condition before I could continue cancer treatment. It was an anxious couple of months, but my teams worked together to make sure they were doing what was best for me.' Judith64 Heart health and cancer treatment Heart procedures and surgery Some heart problems can be treated with a procedure or surgery rather than medicines. This is always carried out by a specialist doctor, such as a cardiologist or a cardiothoracic surgeon. They will explain your treatment in detail, including possible risks and benefits. Heart procedures and surgery are not always possible. It can depend on the heart problem and your general health. Sometimes the risks of a procedure or surgery are too high. Your doctor may suggest heart medicines or healthy lifestyle changes instead.Having treatment for cancer 65 Angioplasty If coronary heart disease has caused narrow arteries and symptoms of angina, this can be treated with a procedure called angioplasty. It is often done at the same time as an angiogram (see page 53). During angioplasty, the narrowed artery is widened using a small balloon. A small tube (stent) is then put into the artery. The stent helps to keep the artery open. The stent helps blood flow through the artery to the heart muscle. Coronary bypass surgery Coronary bypass surgery is used to treat coronary heart disease and angina. It involves bypassing a narrowed artery. The surgeon uses a small section of an artery or vein from another area of your body. They attach this above and below the narrow section of coronary artery. Heart valve surgery If you have a heart valve problem, it can affect how blood flows through your heart. You may be able to have an operation to repair or replace the valve. Implanted electrical devices Some people have surgery to implant an electrical device to treat certain heart conditions. There are different types of device, including: pacemakers implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). These can help treat electrical problems such as abnormal heart rhythms or a slow heartbeat. Sometimes pacemakers are used to treat heart failure because they can help improve the pumping action of the heart.66 Heart health and cancer treatment Cardioversion This treatment aims to get an abnormal heart rhythm back to a normal pattern. Cardioversion involves giving the heart a controlled electric shock using electrodes that are placed on the chest. It is carried out in hospital so that the heart can be carefully monitored. You will be sedated so that you are asleep during the procedure. Catheter ablation Some types of abnormal rhythm can be treated using a procedure called catheter ablation. During the procedure, a thin tube (catheter) is inserted into a vein or artery in your groin. The catheter is guided to the area in your heart that is causing the abnormal rhythm. Heat (radiofrequency) or extreme cold (cryoablation) is then given through the catheter. Doing this: destroys the area of the heart muscle that triggers the abnormal rhythm can break the abnormal electrical circuits in the heart. Your doctor will give you more information about these different treatments. You can also find out more about them on the British Heart Foundation website. Visit bhf.org.uk/ treatmentsHaving treatment for cancer 67 After cancer treatment If you develop any symptoms of heart problems during or after cancer treatment, tell your doctor straight away. They will assess you and arrange any tests or treatment you need. Some people will have regular follow-up appointments to check their heart health after cancer treatment. This is useful for people who: developed a new heart problem during cancer treatment developed heart changes during cancer treatment had a cancer treatment that may cause heart problems many years later have other risk factors for heart problems. ' I continue to have haematology follow-up appointments every 8 weeks with bloods and PET scans as deemed necessary. My haematologist is amazing and emails me at home and allows me to contact him with any concerns.' PhilippaHaving treatment for cancer 69 Follow-up appointments may be with a GP, practice nurse or a member of the cardiology team at the hospital. You may have regular blood pressure or cholesterol blood tests. Some people will have scans to check how the heart is working. Ask your cancer doctor or GP for more advice about your situation. If your cancer treatment is unlikely to cause heart problems, you may not need follow-up appointments. But if you have other risk factors for heart problems, you can talk to your GP or nurse. They can give you information about your risk of future heart problems and how to reduce your risk. They can also talk to you about a health check to assess risk of heart disease and other conditions. Pregnancy after cancer treatment Pregnancy and giving birth can put pressure on your heart. Women who are thinking about having a baby after cancer treatment should ask their doctor for advice. Your doctor may arrange for you to see a cardiologist. They can give you specialist advice before or during your pregnancy. You may also have extra tests to check your heart health while you are pregnant.Insert divider TOC here Looking after your heart Keeping your heart healthy 72 Eat well 73 Keep active 77 Stop smoking 83 Coping with stress 84 Warning signs of heart problems 86 Share your experiences 8772 Heart health and cancer treatment Keeping your heart healthy You can improve your heart health at any age, even if you already have a heart problem. Making changes such as eating well or stopping smoking can help before, during or after cancer treatment. Even small changes can make a difference. Keeping your heart healthy is important throughout your life, not just during cancer treatment. If you need more advice or support with keeping your heart healthy, talk to your doctor or nurse. The British Heart Foundation has more information about how to keep your heart healthy. Visit www.bhf.org.uk/ informationsupport/support/healthy-living ' When I got the diagnosis it made me take a look at myself. I realised that I needed to turn a corner, start exercising and change my diet. It was time to make a major change.' DavidLooking after your heart 73 Eat well A healthy diet can help prevent some heart problems. It can also help with weight control, high blood pressure, cholesterol levels and diabetes. A healthy diet includes: at least five portions of fruit and vegetables every day - try to have a variety of types and colours meals based on starchy foods (carbohydrates), such as potatoes, bread, cereal, rice, pasta, noodles and couscous - choose wholegrain or wholemeal where possible beans, pulses, fish, egg, meat and other non-dairy sources of protein, such as tofu, bean curd and nuts some dairy and dairy alternative products (such as soya milk) - choose lower fat and lower sugar where possible small amounts of unsaturated oils and spreads small amounts of food and drinks that are high in fat, salt or sugar - try to have these less often plenty of fluids (6 to 8 cups or glasses a day) that are low-sugar or sugar-free - water, tea, coffee and lower-fat milk all count. The British Heart Foundation has more information about healthy eating for your heart. Visit bhf.org.uk/healthyeating74 Heart health and cancer treatment Fats To keep your heart healthy, choose foods that contain healthy unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats. Too much saturated fat can raise cholesterol levels in the blood and increase the risk of heart disease. Foods high in saturated fat include: cheese, butter, ghee, burgers, sausages, samosas, biscuits, pastries, cakes and chocolate.Looking after your heart 75 Monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats are healthy fats. See the table below for examples of healthy fats. Healthy fats Examples Monounsaturated - can help protect the heart Olive or rapeseed oil. Some nuts and seeds, including almonds and cashews. Spreads that are made from these oils. Polyunsaturated - can help lower cholesterol Soya, vegetable or sunflower oil. Some nuts and seeds, including walnuts and sesame seeds. Spreads that are made from these oils. Long-chain Omega-3 fatsThis is a type of polyunsaturated fat found in oily fish, such as: mackerel salmon sardines trout kippers pilchards herring.76 Heart health and cancer treatment Alcohol It is also important to avoid drinking too much alcohol or binge drinking. This can increase the risk of arrhythmias and high blood pressure, and can damage the heart muscle. NHS guidelines suggest that both men and women should: not regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol in a week spread the alcohol units they drink in a week over three or more days try to have several alcohol-free days every week. A unit of alcohol is half a pint of ordinary strength beer, lager or cider, one small glass (125ml) of wine, or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. There is more information about alcohol and drinking guidelines at drinkaware.co.uk Keep to a healthy weight If you are overweight, losing weight will help to protect your heart. If you want and need to lose weight, the British Heart Foundation has more information (see pages 102 to 103). Cancer and cancer treatment can cause problems that may make keeping to a healthy weight more complicated. We have more information about healthy eating and managing your weight (see page 104). If you are finding it hard to keep to a healthy weight, talk to your GP or nurse. They can give you advice and may arrange for you to see a dietitian for more support.Looking after your heart 77 Keep active Regular physical activity helps to keep your heart healthy. It can also help control risk factors for heart disease, such as: high blood pressure high cholesterol being overweight diabetes. 'I'm a somewhat overweight, 71 year old diabetic with high blood pressure, thyroid and cholesterol problems and have had cancer. If I can still walk over the Shropshire Hills, there is hope for anyone!' Alfred78 Heart health and cancer treatment You may find it hard to think about being active when you are coping with cancer and possible side effects of treatment. But even making small changes can help. You could: go for a walk once or twice a day do some gardening go cycling wash the car dance park your car some distance from work or the shops and walk the rest of the way get off the bus one or two stops early and walk the rest of the way use the stairs instead of the lift or escalator. As well as helping your heart, there are lots of other benefits to being active. It can: improve your mood and quality of life help reduce tiredness and some other side effects of cancer treatment help strengthen your muscles, joints and bones. If you are having cancer treatment or are worried about getting more active for any reason, talk to your doctor. They can give advice and may be able to arrange more support for you. We have more information about ways to keep active. You may find our booklet Physical activity and cancer helpful (see page 104).80 Heart health and cancer treatment How much activity is recommended? There are UK recommendations on physical activity. Adults are advised to do one of the following every week: at least 2 and a half hours (150 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least an hour and a quarter (75 minutes) of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity a combination of both moderate and vigorous aerobic activity. To do 150 minutes of activity in a week, you could do 30 minutes of activity on 5 days of the week. You could break this up into 10 minutes of activity, 3 times a day. It is important to build this up slowly, at a pace that is comfortable for you. It is also important to do activities that improve muscle strength on at least 2 days of the week, such as digging in the garden or carrying shopping bags.Keep active 81 Keep your heart and mind healthyBe active Strengthen muscles, bones and jointsBuild strength Sit less Break up long periods of sitting down to help keep your muscles, bones and joints strong.TV Sofa Computerminutes of moderate activity a weekor minutes of vigorous activity a weekdays a weekHow often?

What and how much you do will depend on the following: How fit you were before you were diagnosed. If you were active before, you may be able to continue with the same activities when you feel able to. The type of cancer and treatments you had or are still having. There may be some activities you need to be careful with. Any symptoms or treatment side effects you have. Your age and any long-term conditions you have, such as heart problems. Whether you have bone loss, lymphoedema, peripheral neuropathy or a stoma because of the cancer or its treatment. During your treatment, your energy levels will change from day to day. The main goal is for you to try to spend less time sitting or lying down. If you can, you should try to balance small amounts of light or moderate exercise with periods of rest. Choose an activity you enjoy and set some goals for yourself. But if you feel very tired the day after activity, you may be trying to do too much, too soon. Over time, you will be able to increase the amount you do. After treatment ends, increase your activity slowly. Try to increase slowly to the suggested 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity a week. There are more tips on keeping active in our guide Move more: your guide to becoming more active (see page 104).Looking after your heart 83 Stop smoking If you smoke, giving up is the best thing you can do for your heart. After you stop smoking, your risk of developing coronary heart disease or having a heart attack dramatically reduces.

You may be dealing with some difficult emotions, worrying about the future, and coping with treatment and side effects. Stress can raise your blood pressure and put more strain on your heart than usual. Smoking, drinking alcohol or over-eating to cope with stress can also increase the risks to your heart. If you already have a coronary heart disease (CHD), feeling extremely stressed or anxious can sometimes cause symptoms such as angina. It is important to find healthy ways of coping with stress. You could try some of these ideas: Talk about it . This is not always easy, but it can often help you feel better. You may want to talk to someone you know well, such as family or friends. Or you may decide to talk to your GP or nurse specialist, or a religious leader. Ask for more support . If you have questions about your treatment or other worries, ask your doctor or nurse. And if you feel you need more help to cope, let them know. Work out what makes it worse . Once you know what makes you stressed, avoid these things or get help so you can cope with them. Find ways to relax . You could try listening to relaxing music or doing some physical activity, such as walking, swimming or yoga. Some people find that complementary therapies help, such as a massage.Looking after your heart 85 The British Heart Foundation has information about heart health and coping with stress on their website at bhf.org.uk/stress And there is further information about coping with stress on the NHS Moodzone website.

Early treatment for a heart problem can prevent further problems . Sometimes the symptoms of heart problems are like the symptoms of other conditions. But it is important to get any new symptom checked by your doctor. Always tell your doctor if you: have chest discomfort, pain or tightness have pain that spreads to your arm, neck, jaw, stomach or back feel short of breath feel unusually tired or weak (fatigue) have swelling in your feet, ankles, tummy or lower back have palpitations, which might feel like a thumping or fluttering in your chest have blackouts (fainting) feel dizzy or light-headed. A heart attack is life-threatening. If you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, phone 999 for an ambulance straight away.Looking after your heart 87 Share your experiences Your experience may be helpful to other people with cancer who are about to start treatment. It may help them to hear how you have coped with any heart problems before treatment or because of it. There are many ways you can share your experience. You can: join a patient or support group - you can find support groups near you at macmillan.org.uk/supportgroups or bhf.org. uk/search/location-search volunteer with a cancer or heart disease charity - you can often find out more on the charity's website take part in research or fill in a satisfaction questionnaire - ask your healthcare team for more information, or let them know what you think about the care you had. If you want to get more involved, most hospitals have patient and public involvement departments or Patient Participation Groups. They can give you more information about the different opportunities available.Tips for heart health 89 Tips for heart h e a Lt h Top 10 tips for heart health 9090 Heart health and cancer treatment Top 10 tips for heart health These tips will help to keep your heart healthy before, during and after cancer treatment. Before you start your cancer treatment, tell your cancer doctor if you already have a heart problem. You should also tell them if you have any risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes. Ask your cancer doctor if the treatment you are having is likely to affect your heart. If it is, find out how they will monitor your heart during your treatment. If you have a heart problem, your doctor will want to make sure it is controlled before your cancer treatment starts. For example, if you know your blood pressure is usually high, get it checked by your GP. You may be prescribed medicines to control it. Do not stop taking any medication that you have for your heart unless you have been told to. If you have side effects, talk to your doctor. When you finish cancer treatment, ask your cancer doctor if you will need regular heart check-ups. Ask how long these need to continue for.Tips for heart health 91 Go to your heart follow-up appointments, even if you do not have any heart symptoms. Remember that some heart problems may not cause symptoms. But problems may show up on tests during follow-up appointments. Any problems can be treated quickly and more serious heart problems can be prevented. Know the warning symptoms of heart problems (see page 86). If you get any of them, contact your GP. If you have risk factors for heart problems (see pages 19 to 25), ask your GP or nurse for advice about reducing your risk. Your GP or nurse can also talk to you about a health check to assess your risk of heart disease. If your lifestyle means you are at a greater risk of heart problems, try to make some changes (see pages 72 to 87). Get more information and support about heart disease and keeping your heart healthy from the British Heart Foundation(see pages 102 to 103).

Or you might need financial support if you have to stop working. Statutory Sick Pay If you work for an employer and take time off sick, you may be able to get Statutory Sick Pay. Your employer will pay this for up to 28 weeks. Benefits Benefits are payments from the government to people who need financial help. You can find out more about benefits and apply for them online. Go to gov.uk if you live in England, Wales and Scotland or nidirect.gov.uk if you live in Northern Ireland. Here are some benefits that you might be able to get if you are affected by cancer. Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) This benefit is for people under State Pension age who cannot work because of illness or disability. There are different types of ESA: Contribution-based ESA may be available if you have paid enough National Insurance. Income-related ESA may be available if your income and savings are low, or if you cannot get contribution-based ESA. Income-related ESA is gradually being replaced by a new benefit called Universal Credit.Financial support and work 95 Personal Independence Payment This benefit is for people aged between 16 and 64 who have problems moving around and looking after themselves. You must have had these difficulties for at least 3 months and expect them to last for at least 9 months. Attendance Allowance This benefit is for people aged 65 or over who have problems looking after themselves because of an illness or disability. This could mean getting out of bed, having a bath or getting dressed. You must have had these problems for at least 6 months. Special rules If you are terminally ill, and your doctor thinks you may be expected to live for less than 6 months, you can apply for some benefits using a fast-track process called special rules. Your claim will be dealt with quickly and you will get the benefit you applied for at the highest rate. It does not matter if you live longer than 6 months. Your doctor or specialist nurse will need to fill out a form for you. Help for carers Carer's Allowance is a weekly benefit that helps people who look after someone with a lot of care needs. If you do not qualify for it, you can apply for Carer's Credit. Carer's Credit helps prevent gaps in your National Insurance record if you have to stop working while you are caring for someone else. You do not get money, but it protects your right to a State Pension later in life.96 Heart health and cancer treatment Macmillan Grants Macmillan Grants are small, mostly one-off payments to help people with the extra costs that cancer can cause. They are for people who have a low level of income and savings. If you need things like extra clothing, help paying heating bills or even a relaxing holiday, you may be able to get a Macmillan Grant. How much you get will depend on your situation and needs. The average grant is around \u00a3380, but this may change. A grant from Macmillan would not normally affect the benefits you are entitled to. It is an extra bit of help, not a replacement for other support.Financial support and work 97 Insurance If you have, or have had, cancer, you may find it hard to get certain types of insurance. This includes life and travel insurance. A cancer diagnosis might also mean that you can get a payout from an insurance scheme that you already have. If you are looking into buying insurance or making a claim, one of our financial advisers can help. Call 0808 808 00 00 . We have more information in our booklets Insurance and Travel and cancer - see page 104. Our Online Community forum Travel insurance may also be helpful. Visit macmillan. org.uk/travelinsurancegroup More information The benefits system and other types of financial support can be hard to understand. Macmillan has experienced welfare rights advisers and financial guides. You can speak to one by calling the Macmillan Support Line on 0808 808 00 00 . You can also get information about benefits and other types of financial help from Citizens Advice - see page 112. Our booklet Help with the cost of cancer has lots more information - see page 104. 98 Heart health and cancer treatment Work You may not know how cancer will affect your work, now or in the future. It is a good idea to talk to your manager early on. If your workplace has a human resources (HR) or personnel department, contact them as soon as you can. If they know how the cancer or treatment may affect your ability to work, they can support you better. Some people stop working during cancer treatment and for a while after, until they feel ready to go back. Others carry on working, perhaps with reduced hours or other changes to their job. Some people may decide not to go back to work. Or they may choose to do something different. Others may not be able to go back to work because of the effects of cancer on their health. Going back to work may depend on the type of work you do or how much your income is affected. It is important not to take on too much, too soon. Your cancer doctor, GP or specialist nurse can help you decide when and if you should go back to work. Our booklets Work and cancer , Working while caring for someone with cancer and Self-employment and cancer have more information that may be helpful - see page 104. There is also lots more information at macmillan.org.uk/workFinancial support and work 99 Employment rights If you have, or have ever had cancer, the law considers you to be disabled. This means you cannot be treated differently (less favourably) than other people at work because of cancer. If you are treated less favourably because of cancer, this is called discrimination. The law also says your employer has to make reasonable adjustments (changes) to your workplace and their work practices. If you live in England, Scotland or Wales, you are protected by the Equality Act 2010. If you live in Northern Ireland, you are protected by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Our booklet Your rights at work when you are affected by cancer has more information - see page 104. 'I was determined to try and continue working so I reduced my hours to 22\u00bd over 3 days.'
