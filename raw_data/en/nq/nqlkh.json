Fortunately, Ayurvedic treatment for Erectile Dysfunction and other sexual disorders are shown to be effective and side effect free. So, if you were wondering how to treat erectile dysfunction naturally, this is the blog for you. What Is Erectile Dysfunction, According To Ayurved? Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is a sexual disorder that causes men to struggle to get or stay erect during sexual intercourse. In recent years, this sexual health problem is more common than ever, even with younger men [2]. In Ayurved, ED is called 'Klaibya' and is a well-documented disorder with clear Ayurvedic treatments provided. 4 Types Of Klaibya: - Beejopaghaataja Klaibya: Caused by an abnormality in the sperms. - Shukrakshayaja Klaibya: Caused by diminution in semen. - Dhwajopaghataja Klaibya: Caused by inflammatory diseases in the penis. - Jarasambhavaj Klaibya: Caused by low testosterone levels. According to Vedic texts, ED can be caused due to the excess intake of foods that are sour/heavy or rich in salt or sugar [3]. Imbalanced Vata Dosha with negative emotions like fear, confusion, jealousy, anger, or intoxication can also cause the loss of sex drive.

It is also said to be effective at improving sexual desire, mood, and energy [4]. The biggest benefit of Yoga for ED is its ability to make you feel less stressed.

Safed Musli also has potent muscle gain properties along with being prescribed by Ayurvedic doctors for patients with urinary disorders, diabetes, heart problems, and arthritis. 2.

According to scientific research, Shatavari does this by boosting blood circulation (to the reproductive organs) while calming the mind.
