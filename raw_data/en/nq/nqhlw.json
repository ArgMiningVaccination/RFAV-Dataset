Interactions How to Store Sources & What to Look For Frequently Asked Questions Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) is a lemon-scented herb in the mint family. It is native to southern Europe and northern Africa. Possible uses for lemon balm include sleep, anxiety, and health conditions like cold sores. Lemon balm can be made into tea, taken as a supplement or extract, or rubbed on the skin in lotions. Lemon balm essential oil is also popular in aromatherapy. This article discusses the potential uses of lemon balm. It also covers the risk factors and possible side effects of using lemon balm. Dietary supplements are not regulated in the United States, meaning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement that has been tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, Consumer Labs, or NSF. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn't mean they are safe for all or effective in general. Therefore, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about potential interactions with other supplements or medications. Supplement Facts Active Ingredient(s): Flavonoids, terpenes, phenolic compounds (e.g., rosmarinic acid), Lemon balm, bee balm, honey balmLegal Status: Lemon balm has been assigned Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the United States with a maximum level of 0.5% in baked goods.Suggested Dose: More research is needed for dosing for health condition.Safety Considerations: Current research suggests that thyroid medications or other types of sedatives should not be taken with lemon balm. Although the research is not definitive, antiretrovirals may also interact with lemon balm. Uses of Lemon Balm Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist, pharmacist, or healthcare provider. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent a disease. Lemon balm contains a compound known as rosmarinic acid that appears to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Antioxidants help prevent cell damage. Antimicrobials kill infection-causing organisms like bacteria and viruses. Research on the potential uses of lemon balm is limited. While lemon balm has been researched in labs and in animal studies for certain health conditions (e.g., cold sores, stomach upset, Alzheimer's disease), there is NOT enough evidence to support its use for all because it has not been thoroughly studied enough in humans. It's also important to note that some research used a combination of herbal supplements that included lemon balm. Therefore, it is not known if lemon balm itself could produce the same results. Below are some findings from current research on lemon balm. Anxiety Lemon balm might help reduce anxiety, according to a small pilot study. The study found that consuming a sweetened water-based drink containing 0.3 grams of lemon balm extract reduced stress and improved mood in a group of 25 healthy young adults compared to a drink with no active substance in it (placebo). The researchers confirmed the results by repeating the test with yogurt instead of water. The participants reported feeling the anxiety-reducing effects within one to three hours after eating the yogurt. However, more human research is needed to confirm the effects of lemon balm on anxiety in humans. 3 Health Benefits to Drinking Lemon Water Insomnia A compound in lemon balm called rosmarinic acid is thought to improve sleep in people with insomnia. According to a 2013 study as well as studies before, using lemon balm combined with valerian root significantly improved sleep quality in 100 people in menopause compared to taking a placebo. It's important to note that these studies and others used a combination of lemon balm with another herbal supplement (valerian). Therefore, more research is needed just to look at lemon balm to see if it could produce these effects on sleep without being combined with something else. What Are Hops? Cold Sores Most of the research on lemon balm for cold sores was done using lab test-tube studies. In the studies, it appeared that lemon balm could kill a broad range of common viruses such as herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). HSV-1 is associated with cold sores and some cases of herpes. More randomized controlled trials in humans would need to be done to find out if lemon balm can really help with cold sores. 9 Best Cold Sore Remedies Reviewed What Are Side Effects of Lemon Balm?

Common Side Effects Common side effects herbal supplements which may also be felt from lemon balm may be: HeadacheNauseaBloatingGasVomitingIndigestionDizzinessStomach painAnxietyAgitation The risk of side effects tends to increase as higher doses are used.
