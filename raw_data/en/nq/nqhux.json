Vaccinations Disease prevention is crucial to your health. Getting vaccinated is one of the best ways to maintain good health, and protect you and those you care about against infectious diseases. Vaccinations offer protection against serious diseases by stimulating the immune system to create antibodies against certain bacteria or viruses. [Get vaccine guidance from Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/in-depth/vaccine-guidance/art-20536857), including benefits, safety, side effects and what to know about recommended vaccines for babies, children, teens, adults and during pregnancy. For recommended vaccines based on age, refer to the [adult](https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/prevention-and-wellness/adult) or [child and adolescent](https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/prevention-and-wellness/child) schedules.

Your care team We offer a team-based approach to support you and your health care needs. This model of care is defined by high quality, compassionate medical care delivered by a team of experts focused on getting you the right care at the right time to support your health and wellness. Care teams are your home base for getting the care you need in the most convenient and supportive ways possible. Members of your care team At the center of the care team is you, and your primary care team members will include a physician, nurse practitioners and/or physician assistants, nursing staff, and care team support staff. Each care team member has a specific role in supporting and managing your health and care. Depending on the health situation, additional care team specialists may be included, such as a pharmacist, behavioral health specialist, patient educator, social worker or dietitian. Through collaborative teamwork, your care will be delegated to the most appropriate team member to provide the medical attention and care needed. The benefit of having a care team A care team improves your care in several ways. Rather than depending on just one clinician, you now have an entire team supporting you. When you need to see a specialist, your care team will connect you to the right person. When it's time for a preventive exam or health screening, your care team notifies you to keep you on track with recommended checkups and assessments. You also will have the ability to access care more quickly and efficiently because you now have a team of health care professionals prepared to meet your needs. Seeing a nurse instead of your primary care clinician Your appointment and the care team professional you see are tailored to address your specific health need and its complexity at that moment in time. This allows you access to the right health care professional for the right care at the right time. For example, some registered nurses are specifically trained to provide care related to recurring high blood pressure visits and Medicare annual wellness visits. If the nurse determines your condition has become more complicated, you will be referred to a nurse practitioner, physician assistant or physician for the appropriate care needed. Accessing the care you need Access to your care team is available in several ways for your convenience. You will be connected to the appropriate care team member and through the best care pathway to meet your individual needs. This may occur through a phone call, an in-person visit or through [Patient Online Services](/patient-online-services).
