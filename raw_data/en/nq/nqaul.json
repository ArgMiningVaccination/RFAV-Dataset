YOUR TREATMENTS EXPLAINED WELLNESS CONSULTATION An initial Wellness Consultation is included with every Kamalaya stay. During this orientation, one of our Holistic Consultants will talk with you about your wellness concerns and goals and then advise you on the best treatment plan to maximise the benefit of your stay. BIO IMPENDANCE ANALYSIS (BIA) BIA is a method of measuring several key health markers including levels of hydration, the ratio of body fat against lean muscle mass, and cellular vitality. This helps to determine a realistic measure of your health and wellbeing. This information is useful for setting goals for weight management and fitness, and for making appropriate recommendations to achieve a better body balance to improve overall health and prevent illness. Body Bioimpedance Analysis gives valuable information on cellular health, metabolism and toxicity to help create naturopathic, nutrition, or exercise programs suited to your individual needs. VITAL ESSENCE OIL MASSAGE Kamalaya's unique Vital Essence Oil Massage combines Asian knowledge of energy principles with the science of aromatherapy to create the perfect synergy between East and West. This magical and harmonising experience is a simple and effective way to let go of tensions, improve your health, balance your emotions and enhance your life. One of our Five Element essential oils will be selected to suit your body's constitution: Water, Wood (Air), Fire, Earth, and Metal (Ether). TRADITIONAL THAI MASSAGE Thai massage is based on the discovery of ten invisible energy lines called Sen, which run along the body. Your journey begins with a masterful combination of Thai stretching techniques and deep tissue pressure point massage. This stimulates the blood flow, releases toxins, and allows the body to naturally heal itself and restore suppleness. Daily Thai Massage can help accelerate the pace of the detoxification process and reduce any discomfort. This treatment is available with or without the use of a hot herbal compress. The hot herbal compress, which is an ancient Thai healing tradition, uses a potent blend of herbs that are designed to open energy pathways directly affecting the brain. This can help to clear mental fog, soothe and calm the mind. FAR INFRARED SAUNA Far Infrared Therapy provides deeply penetrating heat while maintaining a comfortable air temperature of 42-45 degrees Celsius. Use of the Far Infrared Sauna has many therapeutic benefits; it stimulates circulation and boosts immunity, increases metabolism and the burning of calories, and promotes detoxification to purify the body. It may also reduce heavy metal accumulation. Far Infrared Therapy deep-cleanses the skin, reduces cellulite, and slows down the ageing process because it promotes skin cell regeneration and unburdens the body of toxins. Various skin conditions may be treated and joint or muscular inflammation reduced. The Far Infrared Sauna promotes deep muscle relaxation to banish tension and stress and a feeling of wellbeing is achieved. Please arrive at Wellness Reception with sufficient time before this treatment to drink the necessary water for hydration purposes. The cold plunge pool should be avoided immediately after this treatment. CHI NEI TSANG Chi Nei Tsang is excellent for a diversity of health imbalances from digestive problems to nervous tension and stress. It promotes circulation and therefore health of the internal organs, while also balancing the nervous system to release stress and facilitate healing. Based on the Taoist theory that refers to the 'gut' as a 'second brain', this treatment releases stored emotional and psychological tension and stress thereby promoting healing on an emotional level. A series of treatments is most beneficial. Chi Nei Tsang is especially recommended for all detoxification, stress release and weight balancing programs. LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE THERAPY This is a detoxifying treatment, using gentle rhythmic strokes and soft pumping movements to encourage the movement of lymphatic fluid without the firm pressure techniques of a regular massage. The lymphatic system acts as a transportation network for the immune system and also as a filter for harmful toxins. By encouraging the movement of lymph fluid to localised lymph nodes your body is supported in efficiently eliminating waste products. Lymphatic drainage may be particularly beneficial in addressing water retention, detoxification and weight loss. This gentle and soothing treatment is also recommended to calm the nervous system and restore sleep. For maximum benefits, two or more treatments are recommended. COLON HYDROTHERAPY Colon Hydrotherapy is a key treatment in any detoxification program, using warm water to gently cleanse the entire large colon. Colon Hydrotherapy aids in the removal of plaque and waste matter that may have accumulated over many years, creating blockages and sluggishness in our digestive system. Removal of this plaque enhances liver function and detoxification, improves lymphatic and capillary function and allows nutrients to be absorbed more efficiently. This therapy can improve ailments associated with a poorly functioning liver, including headaches, fatigue, irritability, skin conditions and many common allergies. It is also beneficial for increasing energy and reducing digestive symptoms such as bloating, gas, constipation and flatulence. Cleansing the colon is also said to bring clarity of mind. Using state-of-the-art, FDA-approved equipment that is safe and hygienic, Colon Hydrotherapy is performed by a highly trained nurse or medical therapist. The water is heated to a comfortable body temperature and any noxious chemicals or contaminants are removed by the filtration system. A series of 3-5 treatments may be required for a full cleanse. A herbal implant may be prescribed for you during this treatment to maximise its health benefits. Chi Nei Tsang abdominal massage is recommended before each session for best results. ORIENTAL HERBAL DETOXIFYING BODY SCRUB & WRAP Oriental herbs are used to gently exfoliate the body in order to improve overall circulation. This is followed by an invigorating body wrap using Thai White Mud, which has long been used by Thai women for cleansing and brightening the skin. The addition of aromatic Thai herbs, each specially selected for its beauty and health-enhancing properties, warms and stimulates the body to enhance circulation. This treatment is recommended for water retention, sluggish circulation, muscular problems and detoxification. IV THERAPY IV therapy involves the dripping of specially formulated infusion fluids directly into the bloodstream at a controlled rate. Our highly trained nurses will connect the drip to your vein, which is quick and painless, while you are comfortably seated and relaxed. Our potent infusions provide powerful benefits from boosting brainpower, metabolism, energy levels and immunity to reversing the signs of ageing and sleep enhancement. The duration of the therapy depends on your body's state and condition, but it will typically require a minimum of 90 minutes. Some IV therapies can be done in less time, while others take longer. OZONE THERAPY Ozone therapy is done through autohemotherapy by drawing from your blood, mixing it with medical-grade oxygen that is exposed to UV light creating O3 bonds and reinjecting it into your bloodstream. The treatment is completely safe and painless and is supervised by our in-house medical team, while highly trained medical nurses administer an activated form of oxygen. The nurse will be present throughout the treatment to ensure guests are comfortable. One session may last 60-90 minutes depending on your overall health and physical condition. HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY Before a guest undergoes hyperbaric oxygen therapy, Kamalaya's medical team will examine the guest's physical condition. During the treatment, the guest will be assisted into the hyperbaric chamber, where the guest will lie wearing an oxygen mask, while 93 - 97% pure oxygen is released and the atmospheric pressure is increased to greater than normal. Inside the chamber, the guests can adjust their posture and position so that they are comfortable and relaxed throughout the treatment. The therapy session lasts between 75-90 minutes and the number of recommended HBOT sessions depends on the purpose of the treatment and how well the patient responds to the therapy. When the session is complete, the chamber is slowly depressurised to normal atmospheric pressure before the guest can exit the chamber. This treatment is not suitable for those with claustrophobia. ASIAN FOOT MASSAGE WITH HERBAL FOOT SOAK Kamalaya's Asian Foot Massage with Herbal Soak is a nourishing treatment which begins with a warm foot soak infused with locally sourced fresh and dried herbs renowned for their therapeutic properties. These herbs help to reduce muscle tension & stress, induce better sleep, inhibit arthritis, reduce inflammation and improve overall blood circulation. To ensure optimum benefits, the water temperature in the foot bath is set as close to 43 degrees as is comfortable. This allows the warmth to gradually penetrate and move up the legs and deeper into the body, bringing with it a welcome sense of calm and rejuvenation. A traditional Asian Hand Massage is then performed to open the energy channels of the chest and related organs, as well as opening the lungs for deeper breathing and the release of accumulated stress and emotions. Following this, a Traditional Asian Foot Massage works on specific pressure points to systematically activate nerve reflexes, thereby stimulating all of the body's organs and tissues to improve overall function and wellbeing. PERSONAL TRAINING Our Personal Fitness Trainers are available to help guide, motivate and inspire you to reach your fitness goals and provide professional training advice during your stay. HOLISTIC ACUPRESSURE FACIAL MASSAGE The result of a collaboration between our Thai medicine practitioner and cranio-sacral therapist, this deeply relaxing treatment uses traditional Thai meridian principles to slow down a hyperactive mind and restore inner calm. The face is gently prepared with coconut oil before acupressure points on the face, neck and ears are stimulated using fingertips and heated herbal compresses packed with nourishing Thai medicinal powders. The massage technique promotes lymphatic drainage for a detoxifying effect that leaves you with a clear head, radiant glow and a soothed soul. IMMUNE RECOVERY FACIAL Suitable for all skin types, this facial combine deep cleansing and a rose crystal massage to soothe the heart and solar plexus chakras. Creating a sense of calm while imparting powerful skin benefits, you will experience inner peace, harmony and balance from the inside out. INDIAN HEAD MASSAGE Based on the ancient healing system of Ayurveda, this massage treatment is received in a seated position to relieve tension and blockages from your shoulders, neck, back and scalp. Using deep thumb and finger pressure, you will experience improved circulation to the head, the release of emotional and physical tension, and an enhanced state of relaxation and mental clarity. REVIVAL EXERCISE Our Physiotherapist will begin with a detailed analysis of your posture, muscles and gait to identify any imbalances. They will then create a customized program of Revival Exercises designed to strengthen the body and stabilise the joints. These Revival Exercises may incorporate Pilates exercises, stretching and other techniques to enhance core stability, improve muscular posture and correct structural imbalances.
