Leksell, Dan; Lindquist, Christer E H 2013-09-01 The authors commemorate the life and career of Dr. Ladislau Steiner, one of the world's most highly regarded neurosurgeons, from Stockholm and Charlottesville, Virginia, who has died at age 92. They review the events of Dr. Steiner's early life, including his early training in his native Romania, his escape with his family from East Berlin, and his postgraduate training in neurosurgery at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Dr. Steiner's work in the development of microsurgery and his collaboration with Lars Leksell in the development of Gamma Knife radiosurgery are described. After his retirement from Karolinska, Dr. Steiner had a second career as head of the Lars Leksell Gamma Knife Center at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. The authors recall their own long association with Dr. Steiner and celebrate his contributions to the field of neurosurgery. [Implementation of Steiner point of fuzzy set.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25161396) Liang, Jiuzhen; Wang, Dejiang 2014-01-01 This paper deals with the implementation of Steiner point of fuzzy set. Some definitions and properties of Steiner point are investigated and extended to fuzzy set. This paper focuses on establishing efficient methods to compute Steiner point of fuzzy set. Two strategies of computing Steiner point of fuzzy set are proposed. One is called linear combination of Steiner points computed by a series of crisp -cut sets of the fuzzy set. The other is an approximate method, which is trying to find the optimal -cut set approaching the fuzzy set. Stability analysis of Steiner point of fuzzy set is also studied. Some experiments on image processing are given, in which the two methods are applied for implementing Steiner point of fuzzy image, and both strategies show their own advantages in computing Steiner point of fuzzy set. [Diameter-Constrained Steiner Tree](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010LNCS.6509..243D) System Guoliang Given an edge-weighted undirected graph G = (V,E,c,w), where each edge e E has a cost c(e) and a weight w(e), a set S V of terminals and a positive constant D 0, we seek a minimum cost Steiner tree where all terminals appear as leaves and its diameter is bounded by D 0. Note that the diameter of a tree represents the maximum weight of path connecting two different leaves in the tree. Such problem is called the minimum cost diameter-constrained Steiner tree problem. This problem is NP-hard even when the topology of Steiner tree is fixed. In present paper we focus on this restricted version and present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for computing a minimum cost diameter-constrained Steiner tree under a fixed topology.

[Steiner trees and spanning trees in six-pin soap films](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AmJPh..78..215D) Roy, Anushree 2010-02-01 The problem of finding minimum (local as well as absolute) path lengths joining given points (or terminals) on a plane is known as the Steiner problem. The Steiner problem arises in finding the minimum total road length joining several towns and cities. We study the Steiner tree problem using six-pin soap films. Experimentally, we observe spanning trees as well as Steiner trees partly by varying the pin diameter. We propose a possibly exact expression for the length of a spanning tree or a Steiner tree, which fails mysteriously in certain cases.

[A restricted Steiner tree problem is solved by Geometric Method II](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013SPIE.8768E..0HL) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Lin, Dazhi; Zhang, Youlin; Lu, Xiaoxu 2013-03-01 The minimum Steiner tree problem has wide application background, such as transportation system, communication network, pipeline design and VISL, etc. It is unfortunately that the computational complexity of the problem is NP-hard. People are common to find some special problems to consider. In this paper, we first put forward a restricted Steiner tree problem, which the fixed vertices are in the same side of one line L and we find a vertex on L such the length of the tree is minimal. By the definition and the complexity of the Steiner tree problem, we know that the complexity of this problem is also Np-complete. In the part one, we have considered there are two fixed vertices to find the restricted Steiner tree problem. Naturally, we consider there are three fixed vertices to find the restricted Steiner tree problem. And we also use the geometric method to solve such the problem. [Performance Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms for Steiner Tree Problems.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27959580) Lai, Zhou, Yuren; 2017-01-01 Steiner tree problem (STP) aims to determine some Steiner nodes such that the minimum spanning tree over these Steiner nodes and a given set of special nodes has the minimum weight, which is NP-hard. STP includes several important cases. The Steiner tree problem in graphs (GSTP) is one of them. Many heuristics have been proposed for STP, and some of them have proved to be performance guarantee approximation algorithms for this problem. Since evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are general and popular randomized heuristics, it is significant to investigate the performance of EAs for STP. Several empirical investigations have shown that EAs are efficient for STP. However, up to now, there is no theoretical work on the performance of EAs for STP. In this article, we reveal that the (1+1) EA achieves 3/2-approximation ratio for STP in a special class of quasi-bipartite graphs in expected runtime [Formula: see respectively, the number of Steiner nodes, the number of special nodes, and the largest weight among all edges in the input graph. We also show that the (1+1) EA is better than two other heuristics on two GSTP instances, and the (1+1) EA may be inefficient on a constructed GSTP instance.

It can also be accompanied by musculoskeletal anomalies such as muscular hypotonia and small hands and feet. Mutations in the KMT2A gene have only recently been identified as the cause of Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome; therefore, only 16 patients from 15 families have been described, and new phenotypic features continue to be added. In this report, we describe 2 newly identified patients with Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome who presented with variable severity. One girl exhibited developmental dysplasia of the hip and fibromatosis colli accompanied by other clinical features, including facial dysmorphism, hypertrichosis, patent ductus arteriosus, growth retardation, and borderline intellectual disability. The other patient, a boy, showed severe developmental retardation with automatic self-mutilation, facial dysmorphism, and hypertrichosis at a later age. Exome sequencing analysis of these patients and their parents revealed a de novo nonsense mutation, p.Gln1978*, of KMT2A in the former, and a missense mutation, p.Gly1168Asp, in the latter, which molecularly confirmed the diagnosis of Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome.

This paper addresses the issue of the effect of these approaches on children's drawing ability. To compare the drawing ability in three drawing tasks of children in Steiner, Montessori and traditional schools. The participants were 60 school children between the ages of 5;11 and 7;2. Twenty children were tested in each type of school. Each child completed three drawings: a free drawing, a scene and an observational drawing. As predicted, the free and scene drawings of children in the Steiner school were rated more highly than those of children in Montessori and traditional schools. Steiner children's use of colour was also rated more highly, although they did not use more colours than the other children. Steiner children used significantly more fantasy topics in their free drawings. Further observation indicated that the Steiner children were better at using the whole page and organising their drawings into a scene; their drawings were also more detailed. Contrary to previous research Montessori children did not draw more inanimate objects and geometrical shapes or fewer people than other children. Also, contrary to the prediction, Steiner children were significantly better rather than worse than other children at observational drawing. The results suggest that the approach to art education in Steiner schools is conducive not only to more highly rated imaginative drawings in terms of general drawing ability and use of colour but also to more accurate and detailed observational drawings.

[Tolerance of image enhancement brightness and contrast in lateral cephalometric digital radiography for Steiner Syahraini, S. I. 2017-08-01 Image enhancement brightness and contrast can be adjusted on lateral cephalometric digital radiographs to improve image quality and anatomic landmarks for measurement by Steiner analysis. To determine the limit value for adjustments of image enhancement brightness and contrast in lateral cephalometric digital radiography for Steiner analysis. Image enhancement brightness and contrast were adjusted on 100 lateral cephalometric radiography in 10-point increments (-30, -20, -10, 0, +10, +20, +30). Steiner analysis measurements were then performed by two observers. Reliabilities were tested by the Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and significance tested by ANOVA or the Kruskal Wallis test. No significant differences were detected in lateral cephalometric analysis measurements following adjustment of the image enhancement brightness and contrast. The limit value of adjustments of the image enhancement brightness and contrast associated with incremental 10-point changes (-30, -20, -10, 0, +10, +20, +30) does not affect the results of Steiner analysis.

[Edmondson-Steiner grade: A crucial predictor of recurrence and survival in hepatocellular carcinoma without microvascular invasio.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554743) Zhou, Li; an important pathologic parameter, has been proven to be a powerful predictor of long-term prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, prognostic factors in HCC without MVI remain unknown. The present study aimed to identify the risk factors of recurrence and poor post-resectional survival in this type of HCC. A total of 109 patients with MVI-absent HCC underwent radical hepatectomy were enrolled. The influence of clinicopathologic variables on recurrence and patient survival was assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Chi-square test found that Edmondson-Steiner grade and satellite nodule were significantly associated with recurrence, while the former was the single marker for early recurrence. Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated the independent predictive role of Edmondson-Steiner grade for recurrence. On the other hand, Edmondson-Steiner grade, serum AFP level and satellite nodule were significant for overall and disease-free survival in univariate analysis, whereas tumor size was linked to disease-free survival. Of the variables, Edmondson-Steiner grade, serum AFP level and satellite nodule were independent indicators. Edmondson-Steiner grade, a histological classification, carries robust prognostic implications for all the endpoints for prognosis, thus being potential to be a crucial prognosticator in HCC without MVI. Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier GmbH. Lipschitz the A.; Chesnokova, K. V. 2018-02-01 This paper is concerned with the problem of the existence of Lipschitz selections of the Steiner map {St}_n, which associates with n points of a Banach space X the set of their Steiner points. The answer to this problem depends on the geometric properties of the unit sphere S(X) of X, its dimension, and the number n. For nslant 4 general conditions are obtained on the space X under which {St}_n admits no Lipschitz selection. When X is finite dimensional it is shown that, if nslant 4 is even, the map {St}_n has a Lipschitz selection if and only if S(X) is a finite polytope; this is not true if nslant 3 is odd. For n=3 the (single-valued) map {St}_3 is shown to be Lipschitz continuous in any smooth strictly-convex two-dimensional space; this ceases to be true in three-dimensional spaces.

These activities are specific approaches of how to encourage prospective teachers to use physical experiments to support students' development of mathematical curiosity and mathematical justifications. [SteinerNet: a web server for integrating 'omic' data to discover hidden components of transcriptional profiling, proteomics and reverse genetics screens provide detailed molecular descriptions of cellular responses to perturbations. However, it is difficult to integrate these diverse data to reconstruct biologically meaningful signaling networks. Previously, we have established a framework for integrating transcriptional, proteomic and interactome data by searching for the solution to the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem. Here, we present a web server, SteinerNet, to make this method available in a user-friendly format for a broad range of users with data from any species. At a minimum, a user only needs to provide a set of experimentally detected proteins and/or genes and the server will search for connections among these data from the provided interactomes for yeast, human, mouse, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. More advanced users can upload their own interactome data as well. The server provides interactive visualization of the resulting optimal network and downloadable files detailing the analysis and results. We believe that SteinerNet will be useful for researchers who would like to integrate their high-throughput data for a specific condition or cellular response and to find biologically meaningful pathways. of Ladislau Steiner, a prolific neurosurgeon and radiosurgeon, who died earlier this year.

In this article, non-rectilinear branch pipe routing with multiple terminals that can be formulated as a Euclidean Steiner Minimal Tree with Obstacles (ESMTO) problem is studied in the context of an aeroengine-integrated design engineering. Unlike the traditional methods that connect pipe terminals sequentially, this article presents a new branch pipe routing algorithm based on the Steiner tree theory. The article begins with a new algorithm for solving the ESMTO problem by using particle swarm optimisation (PSO), and then extends the method to the surface cases by using geodesics to meet the requirements of routing non-rectilinear pipes on the surfaces of aeroengines. Subsequently, the adaptive region strategy and the basic visibility graph method are adopted to increase the computation efficiency. Numeral computations show that the proposed routing algorithm can find satisfactory routing layouts while running in polynomial time.

[Water-quality assessment of Steiner Branch basin, Lafayette County, Wisconsin](https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/1981/0052/report.pdf) Field, Stephen J.; Lidwin, R.A. 1982-01-01 Most of the nutrient load of the stream was transported during runoff: total organic nitrogen, 80 percent; ammonia nitrogen, 80 percent; total phosphorus, 84 percent; and total orthophosphorus, 77 percent. Transport of nitrite plus nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen occurred primarily during baseflow conditions, with 75 and 56 percent, respectively, of the total load for the study period being transported during these conditions. The time distribution of total phosphorus, total orthophosphorus, ammonia nitrogen, and total organic nitrogen transport was very similar to suspended-sediment transport in Steiner Branch. [A comparison of the Cook single lumen immature ovum IVM needle to the Steiner-Tan pseudo double lumen flushing needle for oocyte retrieval for IVM.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23644950) Rose, B I; Laky, D 2013-06-01 This study compared the impact of using the Steiner-Tan pseudo double lumen needle for antral follicle oocyte retrieval to using a conventional non-flushing needle. The Steiner-Tan needle has a much smaller dead space than the needles commonly used for IVM oocyte retrievals. This was a retrospective cohort study. The patient population was determined by the time period in which a patient underwent IVM in a single physician's IVF practice. The following data was abstracted from clinical and embryology records: oocytes retrieved, oocytes matured, early maturing oocytes, oocytes fertilized, embryo quality measures, retrieval time, needle punctures, clot formation, and clinical pregnancy rate. The Steiner-Tan needle did not increase the number of oocytes retrieved. It also did not increase the time required for retrieval. However, flushing of antral follicles significantly decreased clot formation in fluid aspirates. Use of the Steiner-Tan needle also significantly decreased the number of vaginal needle punctures during each case. There was a trend toward improved embryo quality, but statistical power was inadequate to show a difference. The primary benefit of the Steiner-Tan needle was on the embryological aspects of IVM. Decreased blood and blood clots in the aspirates made an IVM retrieval more like conventional IVF for the embryologist. The patient also experienced less tissue trauma without increasing anesthesia or surgical time. There was no improvement in the number of oocytes retrieved, but based on the results, we hypothesized that oocytes were more commonly retrieved from slightly large follicles than when using a routine needle. [The node-weighted Steiner tree approach to identify elements Sun, Yahui; Ma, Chenkai; Halgamuge, Saman 2017-12-28 Cancer constitutes a momentous health burden in our society. Critical information on cancer may be hidden in its signaling pathways. However, even though a large amount of money has been spent on cancer research, some critical information on cancer-related signaling pathways still remains elusive. Hence, new works towards a complete understanding of cancer-related signaling pathways will greatly benefit the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. We propose the node-weighted Steiner tree approach to identify important elements of cancer-related signaling pathways at the level of proteins. This new approach has advantages over previous approaches since it is fast in processing large protein-protein interaction networks. We apply this new approach to identify important elements of two well-known cancer-related signaling pathways: PI3K/Akt and MAPK. First, we generate a node-weighted protein-protein interaction network using protein and signaling pathway data. Second, we modify and use two preprocessing techniques and a state-of-the-art Steiner tree algorithm to identify a subnetwork in the generated network. Third, we propose two new metrics to select important elements from this subnetwork. On a commonly used personal computer, this new approach takes less than 2 s to identify the important elements of PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways in a large node-weighted protein-protein interaction network with 16,843 vertices and 1,736,922 edges. We further analyze and demonstrate the significance of these identified elements to cancer signal transduction by exploring previously reported experimental evidences. Our node-weighted Steiner tree approach is shown to be both fast and effective to identify important elements of cancer-related signaling pathways. Furthermore, it may provide new perspectives into the identification of signaling pathways for other human diseases. [A physarum-inspired prize-collecting steiner tree can reduce the time, costs and risks of drug development by identifying new therapeutic effects for known drugs. It is challenging to reposition drugs as pharmacological data is large and complex. Subnetwork identification has already been used to simplify the visualization and interpretation of biological data, but it has not been applied to drug repositioning so far. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a new Physarum-inspired Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree algorithm to identify subnetworks for drug repositioning. Drug Similarity Networks (DSN) are generated using the chemical, therapeutic, protein, and phenotype features of drugs. In DSNs, vertex prizes and edge costs represent the similarities and dissimilarities between drugs respectively, and terminals represent drugs in the cardiovascular class, as defined in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. A new Physarum-inspired Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree algorithm is proposed in this paper to identify subnetworks. We apply both the proposed algorithm and the widely-used GW algorithm to identify subnetworks in our 18 generated DSNs. In these DSNs, our proposed algorithm identifies subnetworks with an average Rand Index of 81.1%, while the GW algorithm can only identify subnetworks with an average Rand Index of 64.1%. We select 9 subnetworks with high Rand Index to find drug repositioning opportunities. 10 frequently occurring drugs in these subnetworks are identified as candidates to be repositioned for cardiovascular diseases. We find evidence to support previous discoveries that nitroglycerin, theophylline and acarbose may be able to be repositioned for cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, we identify seven previously unknown drug candidates that also may interact with the biological cardiovascular system. These discoveries show our proposed Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree approach as a promising strategy for drug repositioning. [Roy-Steiner-equation analysis of pion-nucleon scattering](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EPJWC.13701014M) [NASA Astrophysics Low-energy pion-nucleon scattering is relevant for many areas in nuclear and hadronic physics, ranging from the scalar couplings of the nucleon to the long-range part of two-pion-exchange potentials and three-nucleon forces in Chiral Effective Field Theory. In this talk, we show how the fruitful combination of dispersion-theoretical methods, in particular in the form of Roy-Steiner equations, with modern high-precision data on hadronic atoms allows one to determine the pion-nucleon scattering amplitudes at low energies with unprecedented accuracy. Special attention will be paid to the extraction of the pion-nucleon -term, and we discuss in detail the current tension with recent lattice results, as well as the determination of the low-energy constants of chiral perturbation theory. [Bacterial and fungal components in house dust of farm children, Rudolf Steiner school children Growing up on a farm and an anthroposophic lifestyle are associated with a lower prevalence of allergic diseases in childhood. It has been suggested that the enhanced exposure to endotoxin is an important protective factor of farm environments. Little is known about exposure to other microbial components on farms and exposure in anthroposophic families. To assess the levels and determinants of bacterial endotoxin, mould beta(1,3)-glucans and fungal extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) in house dust of farm children, Steiner school children and reference children. Mattress and living room dust was collected in the homes of 229 farm children, 122 Steiner children and 60 and 67 of their respective reference children in five European countries. Stable dust was collected as well. All samples were analysed in one central laboratory. Determinants were assessed by questionnaire. Levels of endotoxin, EPS and glucans per gram of house dust in farm homes were 1.2- to 3.2-fold higher than levels in reference homes. For Steiner children, 1.1- to 1.6-fold higher levels were observed compared with their reference children. These differences were consistently found across countries, although mean levels varied considerably. Differences between groups and between countries were also significant after adjustment for home and family characteristics. Farm children are not only consistently exposed to higher levels of endotoxin, but also to higher levels of mould components. Steiner school children may also be exposed to higher levels of microbial agents, but differences with reference children are much less pronounced than for farm children. Further analyses are, however, required to assess the association between exposure to these various microbial agents and allergic and airway diseases in the PARSIFAL population. [Practical optimization of Steiner trees via the Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Braunstein, Alfredo; Muntoni, Anna 2016-07-01 The optimization version of the cavity method for single instances, called Max-Sum, has been applied in the past to the minimum Steiner tree problem on graphs and variants. Max-Sum has been shown experimentally to give asymptotically optimal results on certain types of weighted random graphs, and to give good solutions in short computation times for some types of real networks. However, the hypotheses behind the formulation and the cavity method itself limit substantially the class of instances on which the approach gives good results (or even converges). Moreover, in the standard model formulation, the diameter of the tree solution is limited by a predefined bound, that affects both computation time and convergence properties. In this work we describe two main enhancements to the Max-Sum equations to be able to cope with optimization of real-world instances. First, we develop an alternative 'flat' model formulation that allows the relevant configuration space to be reduced substantially, making the approach feasible on instances with large solution diameter, in particular when the number of terminal nodes is small. Second, we propose an integration between Max-Sum and three greedy heuristics. This integration allows Max-Sum to be transformed into a highly competitive self-contained algorithm, in which a feasible solution is given at each step of the iterative procedure. Part of this development participated in the 2014 DIMACS Challenge on Steiner problems, and we report the results here. The performance on the challenge of the proposed approach was highly satisfactory: it maintained a small gap to the best bound in most cases, and obtained the best results on several instances in two different categories. We also present several improvements with respect to the version of the algorithm that participated in the competition, including new best solutions for some of the instances of the challenge. [A construction of unimodular equiangular tight frames from resolvable System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Jasper, John 2013-09-01 An equiangular tight frame (ETF) is an M x N matrix which has orthogonal equal norm rows, equal norm columns, and the inner products of all pairs of columns have the same modulus. In this paper we study ETFs in which all of the entries are unimodular, and in particular pth roots of unity. A new construction of unimodular ETFs based on resolvable Steiner systems is presented. This construction gives many new examples of unimodular ETFs. In particular, an new infinite class of ETFs with entries in f1;-1g is presented. [Roy-Steiner a closed system of Roy-Steiner equations for pion-nucleon scattering that respects analyticity, unitarity, and crossing symmetry. We work out analytically all kernel functions and unitarity relations required for the lowest partial waves. In order to suppress the dependence on the high energy regime we also consider once- and twice-subtracted versions of the equations, where we identify the subtraction constants with subthreshold parameters. Assuming Mandelstam analyticity we determine the maximal range of validity of these equations. As a first step towards the solution of the full system we cast the equations for the to overline N N partial waves into the form of a Muskhelishvili-Omn\u00e8s problem with finite matching point, which we solve numerically in the single-channel approximation. We investigate in detail the role of individual contributions to our solutions and discuss some consequences for the spectral functions of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors.

[A de novo Mutation in deficiency, psychomotor delay, and facial dysmorphism was originally described in a male patient in 1989 by Wiedemann et al. and later in 2000 by Steiner et al. Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) has since been described only a few times in the literature, with the phenotypic spectrum both expanding and becoming more delineated with each patient reported. We report on the clinical and molecular features of monozygotic twins with a de novo mutation in KMT2A. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray was done on both twins and whole-exome sequencing was done using both parents and one of the affected twins. SNP microarray confirmed that they were monozygotic twins. A de novo heterozygous variant (p. Arg1083*) in the KMT2A gene was identified through whole-exome sequencing, confirming the diagnosis of WSS. In this study, we have identified a de novo mutation in KMT2A associated with psychomotor developmental delay, facial dysmorphism, short stature, hypertrichosis cubiti, and small kidneys. This finding in monozygotic twins gives specificity to the WSS. The description of more cases of WSS is needed for further delineation of this condition. Small kidneys with normal function have not been described in this condition in the medical literature before. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. seminal predictions of the pion-nucleon scattering amplitudes at threshold, this process has been of central interest for the study of chiral dynamics involving nucleons. The scattering lengths or the pion-nucleon -term are fundamental quantities characterizing the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry by means of the light quark masses. On the other hand, pion-nucleon dynamics also strongly affects the long-range part of nucleon-nucleon potentials, and hence has a far-reaching impact on nuclear physics. We discuss the fruitful combination of dispersion-theoretical methods, in the form of Roy-Steiner equations, with chiral dynamics to determine pion-nucleon scattering amplitudes at low energies with high precision. [Transoral laser surgery for laryngeal carcinoma: has Steiner achieved a genuine paradigm shift in 2018-01-01 Transoral laser microsurgery applies to the piecemeal removal of malignant tumours of the upper aerodigestive tract using the CO 2 laser under the operating microscope. This method of surgery is being increasingly popularised as a single modality treatment of choice in early laryngeal cancers (T1 and T2) and occasionally in the more advanced forms of the disease (T3 and T4), predominantly within the supraglottis. Thomas Kuhn, the American physicist turned philosopher and historian of science, coined the phrase 'paradigm shift' in his groundbreaking book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. He argued that the arrival of the new and often incompatible idea forms the core of a new paradigm, the birth of an entirely new way of thinking. This article discusses whether Steiner and colleagues truly brought about a paradigm shift in oncological surgery. By rejecting the principle of en block resection and by replacing it with the belief that not only is it oncologically safe to cut through the substance of the tumour but in doing so one can actually achieve better results, Steiner was able to truly revolutionise the management of laryngeal cancer. Even though within this article the repercussions of his insight are limited to the upper aerodigestive tract oncological surgery, his willingness to question other peoples' dogma makes his contribution truly a genuine paradigm shift.

We then proceed to construct solutions for the lowest partial waves of the s-channel process N N and demonstrate that accurate solutions can be found if the scattering lengths are imposed as constraints. Detailed error estimates of all input quantities in the solution procedure are performed and explicit parameterizations for the resulting low-energy phase shifts as well as results for subthreshold parameters and higher threshold parameters are presented. Furthermore, we discuss the extraction of the pion-nucleon -term via the Cheng-Dashen low-energy theorem, including the role of isospin-breaking corrections, to obtain a precision determination consistent with all constraints from analyticity, unitarity, crossing symmetry, and pionic-atom data. We perform the matching to chiral perturbation theory in the subthreshold region and detail the consequences for the chiral convergence of the threshold parameters and the nucleon mass.

[On the Effectiveness of Wastewater Cylindrical Reactors: an Analysis Through D\u00edaz, J. I.; G\u00f3mez-Castro, D. 2016-03-01 The mathematical analysis of the shape of chemical reactors is studied in this paper through the research of the optimization of its effectiveness such as introduced by R. Aris around 1960. Although our main motivation is the consideration of reactors specially designed for the treatment of wastewaters our results are relevant also in more general frameworks. We simplify the modeling by assuming a single chemical reaction with a monotone kinetics leading to a parabolic equation with a non-necessarily differentiable function. In fact we consider here the case of a single, non-reversible catalysis reaction of chemical order q, 0 0). We assume the chemical reactor of cylindrical shape =G\u00d7 (0,H) with G and open regular set of {R}2 not necessarily symmetric. We show that among all the sections G with prescribed area the ball is the set of lowest effectiveness (t,G). The proof uses the notions of Steiner rearrangement. Finally, we show that if the height H is small enough then the effectiveness can be made as close to 1 as desired. [Motifs in triadic random graphs based on Steiner Conventionally, pairwise relationships between nodes are considered to be the fundamental building blocks of complex networks. However, over the last decade, the overabundance of certain subnetwork patterns, i.e., the so-called motifs, has attracted much attention. It has been hypothesized that these motifs, instead of links, serve as the building blocks of network structures. Although the relation between a network's topology and the general properties of the system, such as its function, its robustness against perturbations, or its efficiency in spreading information, is the central theme of network science, there is still a lack of sound generative models needed for testing the functional role of subgraph motifs. Our work aims to overcome this limitation. We employ the framework of exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to define models based on triadic substructures. The fact that only a small portion of triads can actually be set independently poses a challenge for the formulation of such models. To overcome this obstacle, we use Steiner triple systems (STSs). These are partitions of sets of nodes into pair-disjoint triads, which thus can be specified independently. Combining the concepts of ERGMs and STSs, we suggest generative models capable of generating ensembles of networks with nontrivial triadic Z-score profiles. Further, we discover inevitable correlations between the abundance of triad patterns, which occur solely for statistical reasons and need to be taken into account when discussing the functional implications of motif statistics. Moreover, we calculate the degree distributions of our triadic random graphs analytically. [Performance of a cavity-method-based prize-collecting behavior of an algorithm derived from the cavity method for the prize-collecting steiner tree (PCST) problem on graphs. The algorithm is based on the zero temperature limit of the cavity equations and as such is formally simple (a fixed point equation resolved by iteration) and distributed (parallelizable). We provide a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide range of existing benchmarks, networks, and random graphs. Specifically, we consider an enhanced derivative of the Goemans-Williamson heuristics and the dhea solver, a branch and cut integer linear programming based approach. The comparison shows that the cavity algorithm outperforms the two algorithms in most large instances both in running time and quality of the solution. Finally we prove a few optimality properties of the solutions provided by our algorithm, including optimality under the two postprocessing procedures defined in the Goemans-Williamson derivative and global optimality in some limit cases.

[MIP models for connected facility Gollowitzer, Stefan; Ljubi, This article comprises the first theoretical and computational study on mixed integer programming (MIP) models for the connected facility location problem (ConFL). ConFL combines facility location and Steiner trees: given a set of customers, a set of potential facility locations and some inter-connection nodes, ConFL searches for the minimum-cost way of assigning each customer to exactly one open facility, and connecting the open facilities via a Steiner tree. The costs needed for building the Steiner tree, facility opening costs and the assignment costs need to be minimized. We model ConFL using seven compact and three mixed integer programming formulations of exponential size. We also show how to transform ConFL into the Steiner arborescence problem. A full hierarchy between the models is provided. For two exponential size models we develop a branch-and-cut algorithm. An extensive computational study is based on two benchmark sets of randomly generated instances with up to 1300 nodes and 115,000 edges. We empirically compare the presented models with respect to the quality of obtained bounds and the corresponding running time. We report optimal values for all but 16 instances for which the obtained gaps are below 0.6%.

Underlying both Elizabeth Telfer's article and Dr Steiner's reply, the base is inescapably a 'political' one, but cannot be abandoned in favour of purely philosophical concepts. Whatever the attitude of mind of the reader of these two papers to the provision of a health service, the stimulus to more careful assessments of our own National Health Service and its problems can only be good.

L. 2017-05-01 The paper is concerned with the inverse problem of the minimal Steiner network problem in a normed linear space. Namely, given a normed space in which all minimal networks are known for any finite point set, the problem is to describe all the norms on this space for which the minimal networks are the same as for the original norm. We survey the available results and prove that in the plane a rotund differentiable norm determines a distinctive set of minimal Steiner networks. In a two-dimensional space with rotund differentiable norm the coordinates of interior vertices of a nondegenerate minimal parametric network are shown to vary continuously under small deformations of the boundary set, and the turn direction of the network is determined.

[A Sharp methodology for VLSI layout](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993PhDT........53B) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Bapat, Shekhar 1993-01-01 The layout problem for VLSI circuits is recognized as a very difficult problem and has been traditionally decomposed into the several seemingly independent sub-problems of placement, global routing, and detailed routing. Although this structure achieves a reduction in programming complexity, it is also typically accompanied by a reduction in solution quality. Most current placement research recognizes that the separation is artificial, and that the placement and routing problems should be solved ideally in tandem. We propose a new interconnection model, Sharp and an associated partitioning algorithm. The Sharp interconnection model uses a partitioning shape that roughly resembles the musical sharp 'number sign' and makes extensive use of pre-computed rectilinear Steiner trees. The model is designed to generate strategic routing information along with the partitioning results. Additionally, the Sharp model also generates estimates of the routing congestion. We also propose the Sharp layout heuristic that solves the layout problem in its entirety. The Sharp layout heuristic makes extensive use of the Sharp partitioning model. The use of precomputed Steiner tree forms enables the method to model accurately net characteristics. For example, the Steiner tree forms can model both the length of the net and more importantly its route. In fact, the tree forms are also appropriate for modeling the timing delays of nets. The Sharp heuristic works to minimize both the total layout area by minimizing total net length (thus reducing the total wiring area), and the congestion imbalances in the various channels (thus reducing the unused or wasted channel area). Our heuristic uses circuit element movements amongst the different partitioning blocks and selection of alternate minimal Steiner tree forms to achieve this goal. The objective function for the algorithm can be modified readily to include other important circuit constraints like propagation delays.

Invented by Nyle Steiner in the early 1970's, it was designed to give the performer control of dynamics from breath pressure and the ability to make a humanly generated vibrato. Other musical paramaters can be controlled as well. It has a playing range of seven octaves (similar to that of a piano). When musical lines are played using this instrument (controller) connected to an electronic music synthesizer, the sound is much more natural sounding and expressive than when a normal musical keyboard is used. The evolution of this instrument from the pre-Midi era to it latest Midi configuration, principles of operation, synthesizer programming, and its wide use in movie and TV scoring will be discussed. The EVI has played featured musical lines in many major movie soundtracks and TV shows such as Apocalypse Now, Witness, Dead Poets Society, Fatal Attraction, No Way Out, Gorillas in the Mist, and many others. The EVI design has also been adapted as an Electronic Woodwind Instrument (EWI) by Nyle Steiner and has been manufactured and sold worldwide by the AKAI Co. in Japan.

Follicular flushing with the modified flushing system did not increase the number of oocytes, but increased the procedure duration. Most studies on follicular flushing were performed with conventional double-lumen needles in patients who were normal responders. Overall, these studies indicated no benefit of follicular flushing. Prospective, single-centre, randomized, controlled, open, superiority trial comparing the 17 G Steiner-Tan Needle\u00ae flushing system with a standard 17 G single-lumen aspiration needle (Gynetics\u00ae); time frame February 2015-March 2016. with five follicles >10 mm in both ovaries at the end of the follicular phase were randomized to either aspirating and flushing each follicle 3\u00d7 with the Steiner-Tan-Needle\u00ae automated flushing system (n = 40) or a conventional single-lumen needle aspiration (n = 40). Primary outcome was the number of cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs). Procedure duration, burden (Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale; DASS-21) and post-procedure pain were also assessed. Flushing was not superior with a mean (SD) number of COCs of 2.4 (2.0) and 3.1 (2.3) in the Steiner-Tan Needle\u00ae and in the Gynectics\u00ae group, respectively (mean difference -0.7, 95% CI: 0.3 to -1.6; P = 0.27). Likewise no differences were observed in metaphase II oocytes, two pronuclear oocytes, number of patients having an embryo transfer and DASS 21 scores. The procedure duration was significantly 2-fold increased. Testing for differences in the number of patients achieving an embryo transfer or differences in pregnancy rate would require a much larger sample size.

[A Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree Approach for Riccardo Into the cell, information from the environment is mainly propagated via signaling pathways which form a transduction network. Here we propose a new algorithm to infer transduction networks from heterogeneous data, using both the protein interaction network and expression datasets. We formulate the inference problem as an optimization task, and develop a message-passing, probabilistic and distributed formalism to solve it. We apply our algorithm to the pheromone response in the baker's yeast S. cerevisiae. We are able to find the backbone of the known structure of the MAPK cascade of pheromone response, validating our algorithm. More importantly, we make biological predictions about some proteins whose role could be at the interface between pheromone response and other cellular functions.

We show that the resulting values confirm the scattering-length determination from pionic atoms, and discuss the stability of the fit results regarding electromagnetic corrections and experimental normalization uncertainties in detail. Our results provide further evidence for a large N -term, { } N=58(5) {{MeV}}, in agreement with, albeit less precise than, the determination from pionic atoms. [Environmentally friendly education: A passive solar, straw-bale school](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20050763-environmentally-friendly-education-passive-solar-straw-bale-school) [DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)](http://www.osti.gov/search) Stone, L.; Dickinson, J. The Waldorf students in the Roaring Fork Valley of western Colorado are learning their reading, writing and arithmetic in the cozy confines of a solar heated, naturally lit, straw-bale school. The Waldorf education system, founded in 1919 by Austrian Rudolph Steiner, stresses what's appropriate for the kids, not what's easiest to teach. In constructing a new school, the Waldorf community wanted a building that would reflect their philosophy. There was a long list of requirements: natural, energy efficient, light, warm, alive, and earthy. Passive solar straw-bale construction brought together all those qualities. [Comparative study of the craniofacial growth depending on organizations consider mother's milk the optimal nutrition source for newborns [AAP, 1998; Gartner et al., 1997; Mohrbacher and Stock, 2002; WHO, 1989]. However, there is little scientific evidence supporting the idea that breastfeeding has a positive influence on the development of the orofacial structures. The study of cases and controls (observational, analytical and retrospective) and lateral teleradiographs of the cranium of 197 patients (106 breast-fed and 91 bottle-fed) were compared. Ricketts, Steiner and McNamara values were used for the cephalometric analysis. Differences between the two groups were analysed by applying the T-test and ANOVA. Statistical significance levels were set at p<0.05. Non-nutritive infantile sucking habits have been compared; differences between the two groups were analysed by applying the Chi-square test. First, the upper incisors were found to be protruded in the bottle-fed group. Second, subjects belonging to the breast-fed group displayed a brachycephalic mandible arch, while those fed with bottle had a dolichocephalic Steiner mandibular plane. Third, both facial depth and distance of the pogonion to the perpendicular nasion presented a certain tendency to a retruded mandibular bone in the bottle-fed group. And fourth, the frequency of use of dummy and thumb suction were greater in the bottle feed group, without statistical significance. In addition to the multiple advantages that mother's milk offers to newborns, breastfeeding also helps correct orofacial development (not only for the incisors position, but also for the vertical and sagittal relations of the mandible with upper maxillary and cranial basis).

Grassmann's thesis of 1875. One of our tools is a pair of disjoint Fano planes. Another application of such pairs and properties of plane quartics is a construction of a new block design on 28 objects. This block design is a part of a dissection of the set of 288 Aronhold sevens. The dissection distributes the Aronhold sevens into 8 disjoint block designs of this type.

Using Einstein's Equivalence Principle and an extension of his Clock Hypothesis, an explicit description of this influence is derived. We present a new relativity model by incorporating the influence of the potential energy on spacetime in Newton's dynamics for motion under a central force. This model extends the model used by Friedman and Steiner (EPL, 113 (2016) 39001) to obtain the exact precession of Mercury without curving spacetime. We also present a solution of this model for a hydrogen-like atom, which explains the reason for a probabilistic description.

The heat transfer in fluid domain (water or wet steam) and solid domain (tube wall) is analyzed. For the fluid domain the temperature field is calculated solving energy equation using the Control Volume Method and for the solid domain using the Finite Element Method. The heat transfer between fluid and solid domains is conjugated using the value of heat transfer coefficient from evaporating liquid to the tube wall. It is determined using the analytical Steiner-Taborek correlation. The pressure changes in fluid are computed using Friedel model. [Ernst Haeckel's Kutschera, Ulrich 2016-01-01 ABSTRACT One hundred and 50 years ago (Sept. 1866), Ernst Haeckel published a monograph entitled General Morphology of Organisms, wherein key terms, such as Protista, Monera, ontogeny, phylogeny, ecology and the 'biogenetic law' where introduced. In addition, Haeckel coined the word \"biodynamics\" as a synonym for \"general physiology.\" In contrast, Rudolf Steiner's \"biodynamic agriculture,\" originated in 1924, and was promoted via Ehrenfried Pfeiffer's book of 1938 with the same title, is an occult pseudoscience still popular today. The misuse of Haeckel's term to legitimize disproven homeopathic principles and esoteric rules within the context of applied plant research is unacceptable.

However, only a few studies have examined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as related to these processes. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the expression and extent of autophagy and ER stress-related markers in HCC and their influence on clinical characteristics and prognosis for each protein. The expression of autophagy-related markers (LC3 and Beclin-1) and ER stress-related markers (GRP78 and CHOP) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on tissues from completely resected specimens of 190 HCC patients. Their influence on clinicopathologic features and prognosis were evaluated using the chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Correlations of each protein were determined by Spearman's correlation analysis. LC3 expression was not correlated with TNM, BCLC stage, or Edmonson-Steiner grading, whereas it was correlated with longer overall survival (OS) (p = 0.039) and tended to be related with longer time to recurrence (TTR) (p=0.068) although it did not show statistical significance. Multivariate analysis indicated that LC3 expression was a significantly independent prognostic factor of OS (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, p=0.017). of LC3 in advanced stages of TNM (III) (p=0.045) and Edmonson-Steiner Grades (III and IV) (p=0.043) was correlated with longer survival, but not in the early stages. A positive correlation was not observed between the expression of autophagy-related markers and ER stress-related markers. Our results suggest that the expression and extent of LC3 might be a strong prognostic factor of HCC, especially in patients with surgical resection. [One-dimensional Gromov minimal filling problem](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012SbMat.203..677I) Alexandr O.; Tuzhilin, Alexey A. 2012-05-01 The paper is devoted to a new branch in the theory of one-dimensional variational problems with branching extremals, the investigation of one-dimensional minimal fillings introduced by the authors. On the one hand, this problem is a one-dimensional version of a generalization of Gromov's minimal fillings problem to the case of stratified manifolds. On the other hand, this problem is interesting in itself and also can be considered as a generalization of another classical problem, the Steiner problem on the construction of a shortest network connecting a given set of terminals. Besides the statement of the problem, we discuss several properties of the minimal fillings and state several conjectures. Bibliography: 38 titles. [Color fields of the static pentaquark system computed in Nuno; Pedro We compute the color fields of SU(3) lattice QCD created by static pentaquark systems, in a 243\u00d748 lattice at =6.2 corresponding to a lattice spacing a=0.07261(85)fm. We find that the pentaquark color fields are well described by a multi-Y-type shaped flux tube. The flux tube junction points are compatible with Fermat-Steiner points minimizing the total flux tube length. We also compare the pentaquark flux tube profile with the diquark-diantiquark central flux tube profile in the tetraquark and the quark-antiquark fundamental flux tube profile in the meson, and they match, thus showing that the pentaquark flux tubes are composed of fundamental flux tubes.

They suggested that a future review would be necessary to evaluate any changes in international authorship in the journal. As a follow-up, we analyzed non-U.S. publication trends in the most recent 15 years of JABA and found similar results. We discuss potential reasons for the relative paucity of international authors and suggest potential strategies for increasing non-U.S. contributions to the advancement of behavior analysis. \u00a9 2015 Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior.

An overview of general description of fifteen quinoline derivatives has been given. The biological activity spectra of quinoline derivatives have been correlated on structure activity relationships base which provides the different Pa (possibility of activity) and Pi (possibility of inactivity) values. Expositions of the role of intermolecular interactions in the identified derivatives have been discussed with the standard distance and angle cut-off criteria criteria as proposed by Desiraju and Steiner (1999) in an International monogram on crystallography. Distance-angle scatter plots for intermolecular interactions are presented for a better understanding of the packing interactions which exist in quinoline derivatives. [Mistletoe in conventional oncological practice: exemplary cases.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18956494) Legnani, Walter 2008-09-01 Mistletoe therapy, a cancer treatment suggested by Rudolf Steiner in 1920, is a typical and specific anthroposophic therapy, but could become more important today in the field of mainstream medicine. This article analyzes some of the most typical effects of mistletoe therapy based on the experience of more than 100 cases. A few patients were chosen who appear exemplary of the opportunities offered by mistletoe therapy. Their clinical history demonstrates an improvement in clinical condition and performance status, better quality of life, improved psychological status, reduction of infective events, better tolerance of concomitant chemoradiotherapy, and even a direct reduction of tumor size. The conclusion is that the patients may be indicative for future prospective clinical studies designed to confirm a real efficacy of mistletoe in cancer therapy. [Incremental triangulation by way of edge swapping and local optimization](http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19940028440) [NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp) Wiltberger, N. Lyn 1994-01-01 This document is intended to serve as an installation, usage, and basic theory guide for the two dimensional triangulation software 'HARLEY' written for the Silicon Graphics IRIS workstation. This code consists of an incremental triangulation algorithm based on point insertion and local edge swapping. Using this basic strategy, several types of triangulations can be produced depending on user selected options. For example, local edge swapping criteria can be chosen which minimizes the maximum interior angle (a MinMax triangulation) or which maximizes the minimum interior angle (a MaxMin or Delaunay triangulation). It should be noted that the MinMax triangulation is generally only locally optical (not globally optimal) in this measure. The MaxMin triangulation, however, is both locally and globally optical. In addition, Steiner triangulations can be constructed by inserting new sites at triangle circumcenters followed by edge swapping based on the MaxMin criteria. Incremental insertion of sites also provides flexibility in choosing cell refinement criteria. A dynamic heap structure has been implemented in the code so that once a refinement measure is specified (i.e., maximum aspect ratio or some measure of a solution gradient for the solution adaptive grid generation) the cell with the largest value of this measure is continually removed from the top of the heap and refined. The heap refinement strategy allows the user to specify either the number of cells desired or refine the mesh until all cell refinement measures satisfy a user specified tolerance level. Since the dynamic heap structure is constantly updated, the algorithm always refines the particular cell in the mesh with the largest refinement criteria value. The code allows the user to: triangulate a cloud of prespecified points (sites), triangulate a set of prespecified interior points constrained by prespecified boundary curve(s), Steiner triangulate the interior/exterior of prespecified boundary curve [Streamflow forecasting and data assimilation: bias in precipitation, soil moisture states, and groundwater fluxes.](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFM.H44B..05M) [NASA Astrophysics Data Yu, W. 2014-12-01 Uncertainty in precipitation forcing, soil moisture states, and model groundwater fluxes are first-order sources of error in streamflow forecasting. While near-surface estimates of soil moisture are now available from satellite, very few soil moisture observations below 5 cm depth or groundwater discharge estimates are available for operational forecasting. Radar precipitation estimates are subject to large biases, particularly during extreme events (e.g. Steiner et al., 2010) and their correction is not typically available in real-time. Streamflow data, however, are readily available in near-real-time and can be assimilated operationally to help constrain uncertainty in these uncertain states and improve streamflow forecasts. We examine the ability of streamflow observations to diagnose bias in the three most uncertain variables: precipitation forcing, soil moisture states, and groundwater fluxes. We investigate strategies for their subsequent bias correction. These include spinup and calibration strategies with and without the use of data assimilation and the determination of the proper spinup timescales. Global and spatially distributed multipliers on the uncertain states included in the assimilation state vector (e.g. Seo et al., 2003) will also be evaluated. We examine real cases and observing system simulation experiments for both normal and extreme rainfall events. One of our test cases considers the Colorado Front Range flood of September 2013 where the range of disagreement amongst five precipitation estimates spanned a factor of five with only one exhibiting appreciable positive bias (Gochis et al, submitted).

Significant amount of money has been spent on its monitoring and eradication. This paper presents mathematical analysis of spread of pine wilt disease using a set of partial differential equations with space (longitude and latitude) and time as parameters of estimated spread of disease. This methodology can be used to evaluate risk of various assumed entry points of disease and make defense plans in advance. In case of an already existing outbreak, it can be used to draw optimal line of defense and plan removal of trees. Optimization constraints are economic loss of removal of susceptible trees as well as budgetary constraints of workforce cost. [Comparative study of dental cephalometric patterns Fernando Castanha 2014-01-01 Introduction The objective of this study was to identify the patterns of dental variables of adolescent Japanese-Brazilian descents with normal occlusion, and also to compare them with a similar Caucasian and Mongoloid sample. Methods Lateral cephalometric radiographs were used to compare the groups: Caucasian (n = 40), Japanese-Brazilian (n = 32) and Mongoloid (n = 33). The statistical tests used were one-way ANOVA and ANCOVA. The cephalometric measurements used followed the analyses of Steiner, Tweed and McNamara Jr. Results Statistical differences (P < 0.05) indicated a smaller interincisal angle and overbite for the Japanese-Brazilian sample, when compared to the Caucasian sample, although with similar values to the Mongoloid group. Conclusion The dental patterns found for the Japanese-Brazilian descents were, in general, more similar to those of the Mongoloid sample.

An online algorithm, however, processes its input in a serial fashion. In contrast to offline algorithms, an online algorithm works in a local fashion and has to make irrevocable decisions without having the entire input. Online algorithms are often not optimal since their irrevocable decisions may turn out to be inefficient after receiving the rest of the input. For a given online problem, the goal is to design algorithms which are competitive against the offline optimal solutions. In a classical offline scenario, it is often common to see a dual analysis of problems that can be formulated as a linear or convex program. Primal-dual and dual-fitting techniques have been successfully applied to many such problems. Unfortunately, the usual tricks come short in an online setting since an online algorithm should make decisions without knowing even the whole program. In this thesis, we study the competitive analysis of fundamental problems in the literature such as different variants of online matching and online Steiner connectivity, via online dual techniques. Although there are many generic tools for solving an optimization problem in the offline paradigm, in comparison, much less is known for tackling online problems. The main focus of this work is to design generic techniques for solving integral linear optimization problems where the solution space is restricted via a set of linear constraints. A general family of these problems are online packing/covering problems. Our work shows that for several seemingly unrelated problems, primal-dual techniques can be successfully applied as a unifying approach for analyzing these problems. We believe this leads to generic algorithmic frameworks for solving online problems. In the first part of the thesis, we show the effectiveness of our techniques in the stochastic settings and their applications in Bayesian mechanism design. In particular, we introduce new [Comment on 'Modeling of Convective-Stratiform Precipitation Processes: Sensitivity to Partitioning Methods' by Matthias Steiner](http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20040031846) [NASA Technical Server Tao, W.-K.; Simpson, J.; Ferrier, B. 2003-01-01 Despite the obvious notion that the presence of hail or graupel is a good indication of convection, the model results show this does not provide an objective benchmark partly due to the unrealistic presence of small amounts of hail or graupel throughout the anvil in the model but mainly because of the significant amounts of hail or graupel, especially in the tropical TOGA COARE simulation, in the transition zone. Without use of a \"transition\" category, it is open to debate as how this region should best be defined, as stratiform or as convective. So, the presence of significant hail or graupel contents in this zone significantly degrades its use an objective benchmark for convection. The separation algorithm comparison was done in the context of a cloud-resolving model. These models are widely used and serve a variety of purposes especially with regard to retrieving information that cannot be directly measured by providing synthetic data sets that are consistent and complete. Separation algorithms are regularly applied in these models. However, as with any modeling system, these types 'of models are constantly being improved to overcome any known deficiencies and make them more accurate representations of observed systems. The presence of hail and graupel in the anvil and the bias towards heavy rainfall rates are two such examples of areas that need improvement. Since, both of these can effect the perceived performance of the separation algorithms, the Lang et al. (2003) study did not want to overstate the relative performance of any specific algorithms.

[Detection of Vortex Tubes in Solar Granulation from Observations SUNRISE](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ASPC..455...35S) Astrophysics a time series of continuum intensity maps and Dopplergrams of granulation in a very quiet solar region at the disk center, recorded with the Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment (IMaX) on board the balloon-borne solar observatory SUNRISE. We find that granules frequently show substructure in the form of lanes composed of a leading bright rim and a trailing dark edge, which move together from the boundary of a granule into the granule itself. We find strikingly similar events in synthesized intensity maps from an ab initio numerical simulation of solar surface convection. We conclude that these granular lanes are the visible signature of (horizontally oriented) vortex tubes. The characteristic optical appearance of vortex tubes at the solar surface is explained. This paper is a summary and update of the results previously presented in Steiner et al. (2010).

[[Psychoanalytic study of social withdrawal: grandiose narcissism and passive aggression due to insufficient maternal containing in childhood].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23234194) Ogawa, Toyoaki 2012-01-01 Two different types of pathology can cause social withdrawal: the narcissistic--schizoid personality organization (NSPO) type and the mild Asperger's syndrome (mild developmental disorders) type. Only the former type can be treated by psychoanalytic psychotherapy. In the childhood of both types, one may find traumatic family environments which will result in social withdrawal (Hikikomori). In the infancy of the NSPO type, the mother fails to function as a sufficient container of the child's emotion, which encourages formation of a schizoid personality organization i.e. the psychic withdrawal (or \"psychic retreat\" by Steiner, J.). With only a little failure in life events, this may turn into a physical withdrawal for a long time. And in this type of pathology their aggression takes a passive form that hardens their social withdrawal situation. Moreover, the social withdrawal itself serves to reinforce the pathological narcissism.

B.; Renne, P. R. 2005-12-01 Magnetostratigraphy is potentially a powerful tool for deciphering the high resolution chronostratigraphy of events across the Permo-Triassic boundary, but few well-dated polarity reversals exist to serve as calibration. Red beds of the Dewey Lake Formation (DLF) of West Texas span three reversed polarity intervals (Steiner, 2001) in a section of the DLF at Caprock Canyons State Park, where two tuffs occur. Sanidine separated from these tuffs was analyzed by 40Ar/39Ar methods. Single crystal laser fusion 40Ar/39Ar analyses of 40 grains from the upper tuff yield a weighted mean age of 249.9 \u00b1 2.4 Ma (2 errors here and throughout). The clustering of single crystal data provides some assurance against xenocrystic contamination. Two age spectra from multigrain sanidine separates from the lower tuff yielded integrated ages of 248.9 \u00b1 2.8 Ma and 249.7 \u00b1 2.8 Ma and consistent plateau ages of 249.2 \u00b1 2.4 Ma and 249.6 \u00b1 2.4 Ma. Two age spectra from multigrain upper tuff sanidines lack strict plateaus but with overall flat age spectra, with integrated ages of 249.7 \u00b1 2.8 Ma and 250.3 \u00b1 2.8 Ma and plateau-like segments (>70% of 39Ar released) with ages of 249.9 \u00b1 2.6 Ma and 249.9 \u00b1 2.6 Ma, respectively. These results, compared with 40Ar/39Ar data (using the same FCs = 28.02 Ma standard calibration) from the GSSP section at Meishan, China, suggest that the Permo-Triassic boundary (249.8 Ma; recalculated from Renne et al., 1995) definitely occurs within the lower Dewey Lake Formation. The two tuffs, which bracket a normal to reverse geomagnetic polarity transition polarity (Steiner, 2001), have indistinguishable ages. The age of this Permo-Triassic polarity transition is thus best represented by the weighed average of their ages, ca. 249.7 Ma (based on accepted calibrations of the 40Ar/39Ar system). Further such constraints will facilitate high-resolution comparison of terrestrial and marine records across this critical time interval. [Antibiotic use in early childhood and the development of asthma.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10336592) Wickens, K; Pearce, N; Crane, J; Beasley, R 1999-06-01 Recent investigations have focused on the role of infections in infancy in promoting or protecting against the subsequent development of asthma. A related hypothesis concerns the possible role of medical responses to infections, including the widespread use of antibiotics. We chose children at Rudolf Steiner schools to test this latter hypothesis because a significant proportion of parents rejects the use of conventional treatments, including antibiotics. Seventy-five per cent (n = 456) of parents of children aged 5-10 years attending Rudolf Steiner schools throughout New Zealand completed questionnaires which included questions on the use of antibiotics and a history of asthma and wheeze in their children. After controlling for potential confounders, antibiotic use was significantly associated with having a history of asthma (OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.10-6.85) or wheeze (OR = 1. 86, 95% CI: 1.06-3.26) but not with current wheeze (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.54-2-16). The adjusted odds ratio for asthma was 4.05 (95% CI: 1.55-10.59) if antibiotics were used in the first year of life and 1. 64 (95% CI: 0.60-4.46) if antibiotics had been used only after the first year of life when compared with children who had never used antibiotics. The number of courses of antibiotics during the first year of life was also associated with increased odds ratios for asthma: 2.27 (95% CI: 1.14-4.51) for one to two courses and 4.02 (95% CI: 1.57-10.31) for three or more courses when compared with no antibiotic use in the first year of life. Although not significant, the association of antibiotics and hay fever (OR = 1.99 [95% CI: 0. 93-4.26]) was of a similar strength to the association of antibiotics with a history of wheeze. Antibiotics were not significantly associated with eczema (OR = 1.23 [95% CI: 0.71-2.13]). Antibiotic use in infancy may be associated with an increased risk of developing asthma. Further study is required to determine the reasons for this association. [Structure and formation of ant 2011-01-01 Many biological systems use extensive networks for the transport of resources and information. Ants are no exception. How do biological systems achieve efficient transportation networks in the absence of centralized control and without global knowledge of the environment? Here, we address this question by studying the formation and properties of inter-nest transportation networks in the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). We find that the formation of inter-nest networks depends on the number of ants involved in the construction process. When the number of ants is sufficient and networks do form, they tend to have short total length but a low level of robustness. These networks are topologically similar to either minimum spanning trees or Steiner networks. The process of network formation involves an initial construction of multiple links followed by a pruning process that reduces the number of trails. Our study thus illuminates the conditions under and the process by which minimal biological transport networks can be constructed. PMID:21288958 [Integration of Proteomic, Transcriptional, and Huang, Shao-shan Carol; Fraenkel, Ernest 2009-01-01 Cellular signaling and regulatory networks underlie fundamental biological processes such as growth, differentiation, and response to the environment. Although there are now various high-throughput methods for studying these processes, knowledge of them remains fragmentary. Typically, the vast majority of hits identified by transcriptional, proteomic, and genetic assays lie outside of the expected pathways. These unexpected components of the cellular response are often the most interesting, because they can provide new insights into biological processes and potentially reveal new therapeutic approaches. However, they are also the most difficult to interpret. We present a technique, based on the Steiner tree problem, that uses previously reported protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to determine how these hits are organized into functionally coherent pathways, revealing many components of the cellular response that are not readily apparent in the original data. Applied simultaneously to phosphoproteomic and transcriptional data for the yeast pheromone response, it identifies changes in diverse cellular processes that extend far beyond the expected pathways.

To achieve high accuracy and robustness, image triplets are employed and (an approximate) camera calibration is assumed to be known. The focus lies on a complete linking of images even in case of large image distortions, e.g., caused by wide baselines, as well as weak baselines. A method for embedding image descriptors into Hamming space is proposed for fast image similarity ranking. The later is employed to limit the number of pairs to be matched by a wide baseline method. An iterative graph-based approach is proposed formulating image linking as the search for a terminal Steiner minimum tree in a line graph. Finally, additional links are determined and employed to improve the accuracy of the pose estimation. By this means, loops in long image sequences are implicitly closed. The potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated by results for several complex image sets also in comparison with VisualSFM. [Reconstructing targetable pathways in lung cancer cells harbours the potential for characterizing the signaling networks associated with specific oncogenes. Here we profile the transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome in a panel of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines in order to reconstruct targetable networks associated with KRAS dependency. We develop a two-step bioinformatics strategy addressing the challenge of integrating these disparate data sets. We first define an 'abundance-score' combining transcript, protein and phospho-protein abundances to nominate differentially abundant proteins and then use the Prize Collecting Steiner Tree algorithm to identify functional sub-networks. We identify three modules centered on KRAS and MET, LCK and PAK1 and b-Catenin. We validate activation of these proteins in KRAS-dependent (KRAS-Dep) cells and perform functional studies defining LCK as a critical gene for cell proliferation in KRAS-Dep but not KRAS-independent NSCLCs. These results suggest that LCK is a potential druggable target protein in KRAS-Dep lung cancers. PMID:24135919 [Degree-constrained multicast routing for multimedia Yanlin; Sun, Yugeng; Li, Guidan 2005-02-01 Multicast services have been increasingly used by many multimedia applications. As one of the key techniques to support multimedia applications, the rational and effective multicast routing algorithms are very important to networks performance. When switch nodes in networks have different multicast capability, multicast routing problem is modeled as the degree-constrained Steiner problem. We presented two heuristic algorithms, named BMSTA and BSPTA, for the degree-constrained case in multimedia communications. Both algorithms are used to generate degree-constrained multicast trees with bandwidth and end to end delay bound. Simulations over random networks were carried out to compare the performance of the two proposed algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms have advantages in traffic load balancing, which can avoid link blocking and enhance networks performance efficiently. BMSTA has better ability in finding unsaturated links and (or) unsaturated nodes to generate multicast trees than BSPTA. The performance of BMSTA is affected by the variation of degree constraints. [ isobars and nuclear saturation](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PhRvC..97b4332E) [NASA Astrophysics D. 2018-02-01 We construct a nuclear interaction in chiral effective field theory with explicit inclusion of the -isobar (1232 ) degree of freedom at all orders up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). We use pion-nucleon ( N ) low-energy constants (LECs) from a Roy-Steiner analysis of N scattering data, optimize the LECs in the contact potentials up to NNLO to reproduce low-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts, and constrain the three-nucleon interaction at NNLO to reproduce the binding energy and point-proton radius of 4He. For heavier nuclei we use the coupled-cluster method to compute binding energies, radii, and neutron skins. We find that radii and binding energies are much improved for interactions with explicit inclusion of (1232 ) , while -less interactions produce nuclei that are not bound with respect to breakup into particles. The saturation of nuclear matter is significantly improved, and its symmetry energy is consistent with empirical estimates. [T1 mapping combined with Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in predicting the pathologic grading of hepatocellular carcinoma.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29254310) Chen, C Y; Chen, C C; Huang, Z X; Song, B 2017-01-01 The aim of this study was to investigate the value of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging and T1 mapping sequence in the differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 45 patients with HCC who were to undergo a resection were enrolled in this study. Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance examination was performed prior to resection. T1 mapping was performed before and 20 min after injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA. T1 values of the lesions were measured on pre-contrast (T1p) and during HBP (T1-HBP) on T1 maps. The signal intensity, the diameter and the margin of HCC lesions on HBP images were analyzed. The reduction in T1 value (T1d) and the reduction rate (T1%) of T1 mapping between pre-contrast and HBP were calculated. The Edmondson-Steiner classification of each lesion was made after surgery. The SPSS software package was used for statistical analysis and the analysis of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were carried out by using MedCalc software package. Mean values of T1p and T1-HBP were 1935.4\u00b1730.8 ms and 1257.1\u00b1529.1 ms, respectively. T1p accuracy = 0.685, p = 0.037) in predicting pathological grading was similar to that of T1-HBP (AUC = 0.751, p = 0.005). A T1p of 1648.2 ms or greater had a sensitivity and specificity of 85.19% and 61.11%, respectively. A T1-HBP of 1006 ms or greater had a sensitivity and specificity of 81.84% and 61.11%, respectively. The number of HCCs with a non-smooth tumor margin was 20 (44.4%), and a non-smooth tumor margin correlated moderately with the Edmondson-Steiner grade (Spearman r = 0.491, p = 0.041). There was no significant correlation between T1d, T1%, HCC signal intensity on HBP image grading. T1 pre-contrast and HBP of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced a non-smooth tumor margin in the HBP of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, are useful in predicting the pathologic grading of HCC.

[Distribution and persistence of emamectin benzoate at efficacious concentrations in pine tissues after injection of a liquid formulation.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14727740) Takai, Kazuya; Suzuki, Toshio; Kawazu, Kazuyoshi 2004-01-01 In an earlier paper the authors reported the creation of a novel emamectin benzoate 40 g litre(-1) liquid formulation (Shot Wan Liquid Formulation). The injection of this formulation exerted a preventative effect against the pine wilt disease caused by the pine wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner & Buhrer) Nickle, and this effect lasted for at least 3 years. The present study was carried out to show experimentally that the marked effect of this formulation was due to the presence and persistence in pine tissues of sufficient amounts of emamectin benzoate to inhibit nematode propagation. A cleanup procedure prior to quantitative analysis of emamectin benzoate by fluorescence HPLC was devised. The presence of the compound in concentrations sufficient to inhibit nematode propagation in the shoots of current growth and its persistence for 3 years explained the marked preventative effect. Non-distribution of emamectin benzoate in some parts of the lower trunk suggested that the formulation should be injected at several points for large trees in order to distribute the compound uniformly to lower branches. [Minimal model of a cell connecting amoebic motion a minimal self-sustaining system that can move and compute. Previous work has shown that a unicellular slime mold, Physarum, can be utilized as a biological computer based on cytoplasmic flow encapsulated by a membrane. Although the interplay between the modification of the boundary of a cell and the cytoplasmic flow surrounded by the boundary plays a key role in Physarum computing, no model of a cell has been developed to describe this interplay. Here we propose a toy model of a cell that shows amoebic motion and can solve a maze, Steiner minimum tree problem and a spanning tree problem. Only by assuming that cytoplasm is hardened after passing external matter (or softened part) through a cell, the shape of the cell and the cytoplasmic flow can be changed. Without cytoplasm hardening, a cell is easily destroyed. This suggests that cytoplasmic hardening and/or sol-gel transformation caused by external perturbation can keep a cell in a critical state leading to a wide variety of shapes and motion. [Dynamic probability control limits for risk-adjusted Bernoulli cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart developed by Steiner et al. (2000) is an increasingly popular tool for monitoring clinical and surgical performance. In practice, however, the use of a fixed control limit for the chart leads to a quite variable in-control average run length performance for patient populations with different risk score distributions. To overcome this problem, we determine simulation-based dynamic probability control limits (DPCLs) patient-by-patient for the risk-adjusted Bernoulli CUSUM charts. By maintaining the probability of a false alarm at a constant level conditional on no false alarm for previous observations, our risk-adjusted CUSUM charts with DPCLs have consistent in-control performance at the desired level with approximately geometrically distributed run lengths. Our simulation results demonstrate that our method does not rely on any information or assumptions about the patients' risk distributions. The use of DPCLs for risk-adjusted Bernoulli CUSUM charts allows each chart to be designed for the corresponding particular sequence of patients for a surgeon or hospital. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. or engorged larvae. Nematodes apparently enter the tick through the genital pore, thus precluding infection of immature ticks. The timing of tick mortality, and overall mortality after 17 d, did not differ between infections by S. carpocapsae and S. glaseri. These nematodes typically do not complete their life cycles or produce infective juveniles in I. scapularis. However, both species successfully produced infective juveniles when the tick body was slit before nematode infection. Mortality of engorged I. scapularis females infected by S. carpocapsae was greater than uninfected controls, but did not vary significantly with nematode concentration (50-3,000 infective juveniles per 5-cm-diameter infective juveniles per petri dish (5 ticks per dish). Hatched egg masses of infected ticks weighed less than those of uninfected controls. Mortality of infected ticks was greatest between 20 and 30?C, and was lower at 15?C. [Avoiding reification. Heuristic effectiveness of mathematics and the prediction of the - particle](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016SHPMP..53...20G) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Ginammi, Michele 2016-02-01 According to Steiner (1998), in contemporary physics new important discoveries are often obtained by means of strategies which rely on purely formal mathematical considerations. In such discoveries, mathematics seems to have a peculiar and controversial role, which apparently cannot be accounted for by means of standard methodological criteria. M. Gell-Mann and Y. Ne'eman's prediction of the - particle is usually considered a typical example of application of this kind of strategy. According to Bangu (2008), this prediction is apparently based on the employment of a highly controversial principle-what he calls the \"reification principle\". Bangu himself takes this principle to be methodologically unjustifiable, but still indispensable to make the prediction logically sound. In the present paper I will offer a new reconstruction of the reasoning that led to this prediction. By means of this reconstruction, I will show that we do not need to postulate any \"reificatory\" role of mathematics in contemporary physics and I will contextually clarify the representative and heuristic role of mathematics in science. [Relativistic Newtonian dynamics for objects and particles](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EL....11749003F) [NASA Astrophysics (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Friedman, Y. 2017-04-01 Relativistic Newtonian Dynamics (RND) was introduced in a series of recent papers by the author, in partial cooperation with J. M. Steiner. RND was capable of describing non-classical behavior of motion under a central attracting force. RND incorporates the influence of potential energy on spacetime in Newtonian dynamics, treating gravity as a force in flat spacetime. It was shown that this dynamics predicts accurately gravitational time dilation, the anomalous precession of Mercury and the periastron advance of any binary. In this paper the model is further refined and extended to describe also the motion of both objects with non-zero mass and massless particles, under a conservative attracting force. It is shown that for any conservative force a properly defined energy is conserved on the trajectories and if this force is central, the angular momentum is also preserved. An RND equation of motion is derived for motion under a conservative force. As an application, it is shown that RND predicts accurately also the Shapiro time delay - the fourth test of GR. [The Great Emch Closure Theorem and a combinatorial Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Avksentyev, E. A. relations between the theorems (Poncelet's, Steiner's, Emch's, and the zigzag theorems) and some of their generalizations are discussed. It is known that Emch's Theorem is the most general of these, while the others follow as special cases. A generalization of Emch's Theorem to pencils of circles is proved, which (by analogy with the Great Poncelet Theorem) can be called the Great Emch Theorem. It is shown that the Great Emch and Great Poncelet Theorems are equivalent and can be derived one from the other using elementary geometry, and also that both hold in the Lobachevsky plane as well. A new closure theorem is also obtained, in which the construction of closure is slightly more involved: closure occurs on a variable circle which is tangent to a fixed pair of circles. In conclusion, a combinatorial proof of Poncelet's Theorem is given, which deduces the closure principle for an arbitrary number of steps from the principle for three steps using combinatorics and number theory.

We call this system the generalized Chebyshev-Koornwinder oscillator. In this paper, we study the properties of infinite-dimensional Lie algebra that is analogous to the Heisenberg algebra for the Chebyshev-Koornwinder oscillator. We construct the exact irreducible representation of this algebra in a Hilbert space H of functions that are defined on a region which is bounded by the Steiner hypocycloid. The functions are square-integrable with respect to the orthogonality measure for the Chebyshev-Koornwinder polynomials and these polynomials form an orthonormalized basis in the space H. The generalized oscillator which is studied in the work can be considered as the simplest nontrivial example of multiboson quantum system that is composed of three interacting oscillators. [Biobanking of different body fluids within the frame of IVF-a standard operating procedure to improve The aim of the present study was to develop a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the collection, transport, and storage of human cumulus cells, follicular fluid, blood serum, seminal plasma, embryo culture supernatant, and embryo culture supernatant control obtained within the IVF process under approved protocols and written informed consent from participating patients. The SOP was developed at the Kinderwunsch Institut Schenk, Dobl, Austria, together with Biobank Graz of the Medical University of Graz, Austria. The SOP provides comprehensive details of laboratory procedures and sampling of the different fluids within the IVF process. Furthermore, information on sample coding, references of involved laboratory techniques (e.g., oocyte retrieval with a Steiner-TAN needle), ethical approvals, and biobanking procedures are presented. The result of the present study is a standard operating procedure. The SOP ensures a professional way for collection and scientific use of IVF samples by the Kinderwunsch Institut Schenk, Dobl, Austria, and Biobank Graz of the Medical University of Graz, Austria. It can be used as a template for other institutions to unify specimen collection procedures in the field of reproductive health research. [Many-to-Many Multicast Routing Schemes under a Fixed Hongfa; Wei, Xuerui 2013-01-01 Many-to-many multicast routing can be extensively applied in computer or communication networks supporting various continuous multimedia applications. The paper focuses on the case where all users share a common communication channel while each user is both a sender and a receiver of messages in multicasting as well as an end user. In this case, the multicast tree appears as a terminal Steiner tree (TeST). The problem of finding a TeST with a quality-of-service (QoS) optimization is frequently NP-hard. However, we discover that it is a good idea to find a many-to-many multicast tree with QoS optimization under a fixed topology. In this paper, we are concerned with three kinds of QoS optimization objectives of multicast tree, that is, the minimum cost, minimum diameter, and maximum reliability. All of three optimization problems are distributed into two types, the centralized and decentralized version. This paper uses the dynamic programming method to devise an exact algorithm, respectively, for the centralized and decentralized versions of each optimization problem.

This paper considers the implications of a constellation observed in some adult patients who have increasingly reminded the author of some of the children of latency age with whom he has also worked. In the literature these patients may also have been thought about in terms of 'defences of the self' (Fordham), patients who are 'difficult to reach' (Joseph), 'psychic (Steiner), and those who make 'attacks on linking' (Bion). They may equally be considered in terms of schizoid, narcissistic or borderline personalities, or as showing features on the autistic spectrum, such as mindlessness and extreme obsessionality. Writers such as Helene Deutsch with her concept of an 'as-if personality', Winnicott with his 'false self', and Rosenfeld, discussing the split-off parts of the personality in narcissistic patients, have also offered much to think about in their consideration of some of these phenomena. This paper proposes yet another vertex - the author's own imaginative conjecture - that is by no means mutually exclusive of any of these others. \u00a9 2017, The Society of Analytical Psychology.

Steiner, Ph.D. Project Director, Seminars on Science American Museum of Natural History The American Museum of Natural History, in collaboration with Hebrew University and the Skirball Cultural Center, has created a major exhibit on Albert Einstein, including extensive coverage of his contributions to relativity, quantum mechanics and unified field theories as well as the social and political dimensions of his life. Leveraging the assets of this exhibit as well as the expertise of the Museum's Department of Astrophysics and its Education Department, a six-week online professional development course for K-12 teachers has been created, providing inquires into some of the frontiers of physics through rich media resources, facilitated discussion forums and assignments. The course, which requires only minimal Web access, offers a unique opportunity for teachers across the United States to explore modern physics guided by a working scientist and a skilled online facilitator. The course includes original essays by Museum scientists, images, video, simulations, web links and digital resources for classroom use. The course design, development, implementation and evaluation are reviewed. [Hexamermis popilliae n. sp. (Nematoda: Mermithidae) parasitizing Hexamermis popilliae n. sp. (Nematoda: Mermithidae) is described from the Japanese beetle Popillia japonica Newman in Italy, an area of new introduction for this invasive pest. The combination of the following characters separates H. popilliae from other members of the genus Hexamermis Steiner, 1924: adult head obtuse; amphidial pouches slightly posterior to lateral head papillae in female but adjacent to lateral head papillae in males; amphidial openings large, well developed; amphidial in females and oblong in males; cuticular vulvar cone well developed, vulvar lips greatly reduced or lacking, vagina curved at tip where meeting uteri, without reverse bend (not S-shaped), spicules slightly curved, with a slight bend in the basal portion, approximately equal to body width at cloaca. This is the first record of a species of Hexamermis parasitizing the Japanese beetle Popillia japonica. The only previous mention of mermithid nematodes from P. japonica was an undescribed species of Psammomermis in North America. Hexamermis popilliae will be evaluated as a potential biological control agent in an integrated control program of the Japanese beetle in Italy. [Experimental Investigation of the Electrothermal Instability on Planar Foil Ablation electrothermal instability (ETI) is an important early-time physical effect on pulsed power foil ablation experiments due to its ability to seed the destructive magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability. ETI occurs whenever electrical resistivity has temperature dependence; when resistivity increases with temperature, as with solid metal liners or foils, ETI forms striation structures perpendicular to current flow. These striations provide an initial perturbation for the MRT instability, which is the dominant late-time instability in planar foil ablations. The MAIZE linear transformer driver was used to drive current pulses of approximately 600 kA into 400 nm-thick aluminum foils in order to study ETI in planar geometry. Shadowgraph images of the aluminum plasmas were taken for multiple shots at various times within approximately 50 ns of current start. Fourier analysis extracted the approximate wavelengths of the instability structures on the plasma-vacuum interface. Surface metrology of pre-shot foils was performed to provide a comparison between surface roughness features and resulting plasma structure. This work was supported by US DoE. S.G. Patel and A.M.

[Geoelectric Characterization of Thermal Water Aquifers Using 2.5D This paper presents a short theoretical summary of the series expansion-based 2.5D combined geoelectric weighted inversion (CGWI) method and highlights the advantageous way with which the number of unknowns can be decreased due to the simultaneous characteristic of this inversion. 2.5D CGWI is an approximate inversion method for the determination of 3D structures, which uses the joint 2D forward modeling of dip and strike direction data. In the inversion procedure, the Steiner's most frequent value method is applied to the automatic separation of dip and strike direction data and outliers. The workflow of inversion and its practical application are presented in the study. For conventional vertical electrical sounding (VES) measurements, this method can determine the parameters of complex structures more accurately than the single inversion method. Field data show that the 2.5D CGWI which was developed can determine the optimal location for drilling an exploratory thermal water prospecting well. The novelty of this research is that the measured VES data in dip and strike direction are jointly inverted by the 2.5D CGWI method. [Reduced-rank technique for joint channel estimation division-synchronous code division multiple access systems, increasing the system capacity by exploiting the inserting of the largest number of users in one time slot (TS) requires adding more estimation processes to estimate the joint channel matrix for the whole system. The increase in the number of channel parameters due the increase in the number of users in one TS directly affects the precision of the estimator's performance. This article presents a novel channel estimation with low complexity, which relies on reducing the rank order of the total channel matrix H. The proposed method exploits the rank deficiency of H to reduce the number of parameters that characterise this matrix. The adopted reduced-rank technique is based on truncated singular value decomposition algorithm. The algorithms for reduced-rank joint channel estimation (JCE) are derived and compared against traditional full-rank JCEs: least squares (LS) or Steiner and enhanced (LS or MMSE) algorithms. Simulation results of the normalised mean square error showed the superiority of reduced-rank estimators. In addition, the channel impulse responses founded by reduced-rank estimator for all active users offers considerable performance improvement over the conventional estimator along the channel window length. [Isoscalar-vector interaction and hybrid quark core in massive neutron stars](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PhRvD..87i6012S) [NASA Astrophysics Data Shao, X.; Liu, B. 2013-05-01 The hadron-quark phase transition in the core of massive neutron stars is studied with a newly constructed two-phase model. For nuclear matter, a nonlinear Walecka type model with general nucleon-meson and meson-meson couplings, recently calibrated by Steiner, Hemper and Fischer, is taken. For quark matter, a modified Polyakov-Nambu\u2014Jona-Lasinio model, which gives consistent results with lattice QCD data, is used. Most importantly, we introduce an isoscalar-vector interaction in the description of quark matter, and we study its influence on the hadron-quark phase transition in the interior of massive neutron stars. With the constraints of neutron star observations, our calculation shows that the isoscalar-vector interaction between quarks is indispensable if massive hybrids star exist in the universe, and its strength determines the onset density of quark matter, as well as the mass-radius relations of hybrid stars. Furthermore, as a connection with heavy-ion-collision experiments we give some discussions about the strength of isoscalar-vector interaction and its effect on the signals of hadron-quark phase transition in heavy-ion collisions, in the energy range of the NICA at JINR-Dubna and FAIR at GSI-Darmstadt facilities. [A study of X-ray variation in LMC persistently luminous X-ray black hole binaries accompanying an O type star. It has been observed repeatedly since its discovery by a rocket mission (Mark et al. 1969). LMC X-1 was observed with Suzaku in July 2009 for 120 ksec, and was detected over a wide X-ray band of 0.5-50 keV. As Steiner et al. (2012) reported, the source was in the soft state with 10% of Eddington luminosity, and the spectrum showed a clear iron line emission. We analyzed the Suzaku light curve and found intensity-correlated variations in the spectral hardness ratio on a timescale of 10 ksec. The variation is explained by 10% changes in the Comptonised emission, possibly accompanied by those in the narrow iron line. Assuming that the variation timescale corresponds to the viscous time scale of a standard accretion disk, these components are considered to have been emitted from a region at a distance of 150 Rg from the black hole. We also found 3 mHz QPO in lower energy band. We discuss geometry of accretion flow and interpretation of the low freqency QPO. [Hybrid X-pinch Experiments on a MA Linear Transformer [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) A.; Lau, Y. Y. 2013-10-01 X-pinch experiments have been conducted on the Linear Transformer Driver (LTD) at the University of Michigan. The x-pinch consists of a single wire separated by conical electrodes between two current return plates. The LTD was charged to +/-70 kV resulting in approximately 0.5 MA passing through a 35 m Al wire. Multiple, short x-ray bursts were detected over the 400 ns current pulse. Ultimately the x-pinch will be located in parallel with a planar foil in order to backlight the Magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instability. A smaller 100 kA driver is also in development and may be used to independently energize the x-pinch. The x-pinch chamber has been constructed and the results of these experiments will be presented.

Yager-Elorriaga is supported by an NSF fellowship under 1256260. in the framework of chiral perturbation theory up to fourth order within the heavy-baryon expansion and a covariant approach based on an extended on-mass-shell renormalization scheme. We discuss in detail the renormalization of the various low-energy constants and provide explicit expressions for the relevant functions and the finite subtractions of the power-counting breaking terms within the covariant formulation. To estimate the theoretical uncertainty from the truncation of the chiral expansion, we employ an approach which has been successfully applied in the most recent analysis of the nuclear forces. This allows us to reliably extract the relevant low-energy constants from the available scattering data at low energy. The obtained results provide clear evidence that the breakdown scale of the chiral expansion for this reaction is related to the resonance. The explicit inclusion of the leading contributions of the isobar is demonstrated to substantially increase the range of applicability of the effective field theory. The resulting predictions for the phase shifts are in an excellent agreement with the predictions from the recent Roy-Steiner-equation analysis of pion-nucleon scattering. [Using the preschool language scale, fourth edition to characterize language in preschoolers with autism spectrum Language Scale, Fourth Edition (PLS-4; Zimmerman, Steiner, & Pond, 2002) was used to examine syntactic and semantic language skills in preschool children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) to determine its suitability for use with this population. We expected that PLS-4 performance would be better in more intellectually able children and that receptive skills would be relatively more impaired than expressive abilities, consistent with previous findings in the area of vocabulary. Our sample consisted of 294 newly diagnosed preschool children with ASD. Children were assessed via a battery of developmental measures, including the PLS-4. As expected, PLS-4 scores were higher in more intellectually able children with ASD, and overall, expressive communication was higher than auditory comprehension. However, this overall advantage was not stable across nonverbal developmental levels. Expressive skills were significantly better than receptive skills at the youngest developmental levels, whereas the converse applied in children with more advanced development. The PLS-4 can be used to obtain a general index of early syntax and semantic skill in young children with ASD. Longitudinal data will be necessary to determine how the developmental relationship between receptive and expressive language skills unfolds in children with ASD. [Determination of aminopolycarboxylic acids in river water by solid-phase extraction on activated charcoal cartridges and gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. Method performance characteristics and estimation of the uncertainty.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23498691) Jim\u00e9nez, Juan J 2013-04-03 A new sample preparation procedure to determine aminopolycarboxylic acids (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, EDTA, nitrilotriacetic acid, NTA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, DTPA, and cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid, CDTA) in river water is described. The procedure consists of the solid-phase extraction of the aminopolycaroxyllic acids on activated charcoal cartridges after increasing the ionic strength and acidifying the sample. The extract was eluted with methanol and the analytes were methylated in presence of BF3/methanol to determine them by GC with mass spectrometric detection. Recoveries were higher than 90% with good repeatabilities and inter-day precision for concentrations close to quantification limits (about 10 g L(-1)) and higher. It has been verified that the proposed method is robust according to the Youden and Steiner test and free of matrix effects arisen from the presence of organic matter and iron(III) as deduced from statistical tests. A bottom-up approach was followed to estimate the uncertainty of the measured concentration. At concentrations close to 10 g L(-1) the most relevant step of the method is the calculus of the interpolated concentration which has a high value of relative standard uncertainty.

[Fluoride bioaccumulation by hydroponic cultures of ability of hydroponic cultures of camellia and sugar cane adult plants to remove fluoride was investigated. Plants were grown in a 50% Steiner nutrient solution. After an adaptation period to hydroponic conditions, plants were exposed to different fluoride concentrations (0, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg L(-1)). Fluoride concentration in the culture medium and in tissues was measured. In sugar cane, fluoride was mainly located in roots, with 86% of it absorbed and 14% adsorbed. Sugar cane plants removed 1000-1200 mg fluoride kg(-1) dry weight. In camellia plants the highest fluoride concentration was found in leaf. Roots accumulated fluoride mainly through absorption, which was 2-5 times higher than adsorption. At the end of the experiment, fluoride accumulation in camellia plants was 1000-1400 mgk g(-1) dry weight. Estimated concentration factors revealed that fluoride bioaccumulation is 74-221-fold in camellia plants and 100-500-fold in sugar cane plants. Thus, the latter appear as a suitable candidate for removing fluoride from water due to their bioaccumulation capacity and vigorous growth rate; therefore, sugar cane might be used for phytoremediation.

[NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Hagan, Catherine Beverly Anne Rodin This thesis explores the fundamental experiential connections between visual art and science. The author links the academic text to multiple visual essays in an exploration of the holistic teaching and learning methodologies in visual art pedagogy. An examination of the educational philosophies of Dewey and Steiner supports the focus on experience as education. The philosophies of Eisner, Goudy, Dewey, London, Arnheim and Wallschlaeger provide a foundation for the overall structure of the separate concepts of visual art. The inclusion of visual essays and the hermeneutical mode in which they are sequenced follows the theories and examples of Sontag, Barthes, Berger, Silvers and Wilde. Creativity studies conducted by Csikszentmihalyi and the theories of invention in science investigated by Kuhn and Judson connect the creative process in visual art to science. Sheen, Feynman, D'Arcy Thompson and Capra offer a perspective on the learning, teaching and evaluation methodologies and philosophy in the area of science, particularly physics, botany and geometry. The examination of these theories as background, combined with narrative experiences and the exploratory visual component, draw out conclusions and implications about the untapped potential of visual art in education. [Cold-stenothermic spring fauna in mountainous headwaters of the National Park Kellerwald-Edersee in Germany](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..19.7975R) Stefan; Chifflard, Peter 2017-04-01 Since 2002, spring habitat investigations and mapping campaigns were executed in the National Park Kellerwald-Edersee (Central Germany, Federal State of Hesse). 693 springs are currently assessed within an ongoing ecological-faunistic inventory with additional data about physico-chemical properties and hydrological conditions of the spring water (e.g. pH value, electrical conductivity, water temperature and flow velocity). 1029 taxa are found so far, whereby, springs are investigated as a land-water ecotone where aquatic and terrestrial fauna was detected. Data continuously stored in the data base of the Hesse Biospeleological Register (Reiss, Steiner, Zaenker 2009) coupled with a Geographical Information System. Spring habitats can be characterized as mostly undisturbed, oligotrophic and near natural structured with heterogenous microhabitat conditions. Nearly 90 percentages of the springs are helocrenic habitats with a diffuse and low discharge, temporally dried out, but staying under wet substrate conditions. 85 percentages of the springs occurring under forests without any cultivation or forest management use. Coarse mineral substrate dominating slightly, followed up by fine mineral substrate types. Most common mineral related microhabitats are microlithal (coarse gravel) and psammopelal (fine silt). The high microhabitat diversity depends mostly to forest correlated organic substrate types. Here, most dominant are CPOM (leaf litter) and woody debris (deadwood). Substrate richness is significantly correlated to preferential fauna colonization of different, partly rare or endangered species. Undisturbed conditions are also characterized by relative cold stenothermy and oligotrophy. The latter is indicated by a very low electrical conductivity (Mean: 236 \u00b5S*cm-1). The mean annual water temperature is 9\u00b0 Celsius with low amplitudes of max. and min. values. Spring water is nearly neutral and there is no identifiable trend in acidification (mean pH value of 6 [Intellect, Dream and Action: Story-Telling in Steiner Schools in New Zealand and the Embedding of Indigenous Narrative Knowledge in Education](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1081611.pdf) [ERIC Educational Resources Information Center](http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/extended.jsp?_pageLabel=advanced) Burnett, John 2015-01-01 This paper argues that the historic mode of expression for Indigenous knowledge has been essentially visionary and mythic, often grounded in oral traditions of great antiquity.

[Measurement properties and classification accuracy of two spanish parent surveys of language development for preschool-age children.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20484705) Guiberson, Mark; Rodr\u00edguez, Barbara L 2010-08-01 To describe the concurrent validity and classification accuracy of 2 Spanish parent surveys of language development, the Spanish Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ; Squires, Potter, & Bricker, 1999) Spanish-speaking parents of preschool-age children participated. Twenty-two children had expressive language delays, and 26 had typical language development. The parents completed the Spanish ASQ and the Pilot INV-III at home, and the Preschool Language Scale, Fourth Edition: Spanish Edition (PLS-4 Spanish; Zimmerman, Steiner, & Pond, 2002) was administered to the children at preschool centers. The Spanish ASQ and Pilot INV-III were significantly correlated with the PLS-4 Spanish, establishing concurrent validity. On both surveys, children with expressive language delays scored significantly lower than children with typical development. The Spanish ASQ demonstrated unacceptably low sensitivity (59%) and good specificity (92%), while the Pilot INV-III demonstrated fair sensitivity (82%) and specificity (81%). Likelihood ratios and posttest probability revealed that the Pilot INV-III may assist in detection of expressive language delays, but viewed alone it is insufficient to make an unconditional screening determination. Results suggest that Spanish parent surveys hold promise for screening language delay in Spanish-speaking preschool children; however, further refinement of these tools is needed. [First Experiments with Planar Wire Arrays on U Michigan's Linear Transformer Driver](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014APS..DPPGO4001S) [NASA petawatt-class Z-pinch accelerators, a Linear Transformer Driver (LTD)-driven accelerator promises to be (at a given pinch current and implosion time) more efficient than the conventionally used Marx-driven accelerator. Because there exists almost no data on how wire arrays radiate on LTD-based machines in the USA, it is very important to perform radiation and plasma physics studies on this new type of generator. We report on the first outcome of the new partnership with University of Michigan (UM), which resulted in successful UNR-UM experiments on the low-impedance MAIZE generator with planar wire arrays (PWA). PWA is a novel wire array load that was introduced and tested in detail on high-impedance Zebra at UNR during the last years and found to be the most efficient radiator. Implosion of Al Double PWAs of different configurations were achieved on MAIZE, observed with a set of various diagnostics which include x-ray diode detectors, x-ray spectroscopy and imaging, and shadowgraphy. Al and Mg plasmas of more than 450 eV were studied in detail. Research supported by NNSA under DOE Cooperative Agreement DE-NA0001984. S. G. Patel and A. M.

[Experimental Investigation of the Effects of an Axial Magnetic Field on the Magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor Instability in Ablating Planar Foils](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014APS..DPPJP8104Y) [NASA Astrophysics M.; M. R.; Gilgenbach, R. M.; Lau, Y. Y. 2014-10-01 Experiments are underway to study the effects an axial magnetic field on the magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRT) in ablating planar foils on the 1-MA LTD at the Michigan Accelerator for Inductive Z-pinch Experiments (MAIZE) facility at the University of Michigan. For 600 kA drive current, a 15 T axial magnetic field is produced using helical return current posts. During the current pulse, the magnetic field may diffuse into the foil, creating a sheared magnetic field along with the possibility of shear stabilization of the MRT instability. Theoretical investigation at UM has shown that a sheared azimuthal magnetic field coupled with an axial magnetic field reduces the MRT growth rate in general. In order to study this effect, the amount of magnetic shear is controlled by offsetting the initial position of the foil. A 775 nm Ti:sapphire laser will be used to shadowgraph the foil in order to measure the MRT growth rate. By comparing these results to previous experiments at UM, the effects of magnetic shear and an axial magnetic field will be determined. This work was supported by US DoE. S.G. Patel and A.M. Steiner supported by NPSC funded by Sandia. D.A. Yager-Elorriaga supported by NSF perturbation present results of a third order calculation of the pion-nucleon scattering amplitude in a chiral effective field theory with pions, nucleons and delta resonances as explicit degrees of freedom. We work in a manifestly Lorentz invariant formulation of baryon chiral perturbation theory using dimensional regularization and the extended on-mass-shell renormalization scheme. In the delta resonance sector, the on mass-shell renormalization is realized as a complex-mass scheme. By fitting the low-energy constants of the effective Lagrangian to the S- and P -partial waves a satisfactory description of the phase shifts from the analysis of the Roy-Steiner equations is obtained. We predict the phase shifts for the D and F waves and compare them with the results of the analysis of the George Washington University group. The threshold parameters are calculated both in the delta-less and delta-full cases. Based on the determined low-energy constants, we discuss the pion-nucleon sigma term. Additionally, in order to determine the strangeness content of the nucleon, we calculate the octet baryon masses in the presence of decuplet resonances up to next-to-next-to-leading order in SU(3) baryon chiral perturbation theory. The octet baryon sigma terms are predicted as a byproduct of this calculation. [The Turn of the Millennium, CTIO and AURA-O, 1993-2007](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ASPC..491...39S) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Smith, M. G. 2015-05-01 The decade 1993-2003 was a particularly exciting time to be at Cerro Tololo - for most staff members. Tough times at the beginning involved significant staff reductions - the worst moment of my professional career. In return, the observatory was granted a period of stability in which it was possible to rebuild morale, which in turn helped the research climate to recover rapidly. Emphasis was given to improving the image quality at the Blanco 4m (led by Jack Baldwin), while quietly supporting efficient operation of the smaller telescopes (led locally by Alistair Walker) via the development of the SMARTs consortium. In 1998 came the high point - the announcement of the discovery of Dark Energy that showed us all how much we still have to learn about the universe; this work depended crucially on the work of staff members at CTIO and staff and students from Chilean and Argentinian universities (as described elsewhere at this conference). The Inter-American nature of CTIO also laid the crucial groundwork (in which Joao Steiner was a key player) for Brazil's involvement in SOAR and Gemini. Work during the period to minimize the advance of light pollution over Cerro Tololo (and the rest of northern Chile) helped create a credible case for siting the LSST on Cerro Pach\u00f3n. [Chiral corrections The for the nucleon axial-vector charge, gA , offers a unique signature of chiral symmetry and its breaking in QCD. Its derivation relies on both algebraic aspects of chiral symmetry, which guarantee the convergence of the sum rule, and dynamical aspects of chiral symmetry breaking\u2014as exploited using chiral perturbation theory\u2014which allow the rigorous inclusion of explicit chiral symmetry breaking effects due to light-quark masses. The original derivations obtained the sum rule in the chiral limit and, without the benefit of chiral perturbation theory, made various attempts at extrapolating to nonvanishing pion masses. In this paper, the leading, universal, chiral corrections to the chiral-limit sum rule are obtained. Using PDG data, a recent parametrization of the pion-nucleon total cross sections in the resonance region given by the SAID group, as well as recent Roy-Steiner equation determinations of subthreshold amplitudes, threshold parameters, and correlated low-energy constants, the Adler-Weisberger sum rule is confronted with experimental data. With uncertainty estimates associated with the cross-section parametrization, the Goldberger-Treimann discrepancy, and the truncation of the sum rule at O (M4) in the chiral expansion, this work finds gA=1.248 \u00b10.013 .

The experiment consists of a 400 nm-thick, Al planar foil and a current return post. An optical fiber is placed perpendicular to the magnetic field and linear polarizers are used to isolate the pi and sigma lines. The LTD is charged to +/-70 kV with approximately 400-500 kA passing through the foil. Laser shadowgraphy has previously imaged the plasma and measured anisotropy in the Magneto Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability. Localized magnetic field measurements using Zeeman splitting during the current rise is expected to yield some insight into this anisotropy. Initial experiments use Na D lines of Al foils seeded with sodium to measure Zeeman splitting. Several ion lines are also currently being studied, such as Al III and C IV, to probe the higher temperature core plasma. In planned experiments, several lens-coupled optical fibers will be placed across the foil, and local magnetic field measurements will be taken to measure current division within the plasma.

[A-void--an exploration of defences against sensing nothingness.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11802683) Emanuel, R 2001-12-01 The author describes the potentially annihilating terror implicit in the experience of contact with the void--the 'domain of the non-existent' or nothingness, conceived as an immensely hostile object, terrifying space or a place of 'nameless dread'. All manifestations of existence are threatened by contact with the void, necessitating the deployment of a variety of defences. These various defences--universally employed to avoid contact with this domain--are then discussed. These include trying to search for a fixed sense of identity that can often propel people to seek refuge inside an object or state of mind, as described in Meltzer's 'claustrum' and Steiner's 'psychic retreat'. Other defences, including distraction and grandiosity, are also described. The author then goes on to discuss techniques for helping patients to tolerate contact with mental states engendered by the threat of potential contact with the void, in order to strengthen their capacity to feel and thus enlarge their repertoire of coping with anxiety in a non-reactive and thus growth-inducing manner. This involves discussion about psychoanalytically informed Buddhist understanding of these states and the nature of identity itself, as well as the correlation between these insights and those offered by Bion and other psychoanalytic writers.

[Cephalometric skeletal evaluation of patients with Incontinentia Pigmenti](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4252390) Maahs, Ricardo Gazzola 2014-01-01 Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the skeletal characteristics of patients with the rare genetic disease of Incontinentia Pigmenti, by lateral cephalometric analysis on the antero-posterior plane and by frontal cephalometric analysis on the horizontal plane. Methods Lateral skeletal cephalometric analyses were performed according to Steiner for evaluation of antero-posterior direction, and frontal skeletal cephalometric analyses according to Ricketts for evaluation of horizontal direction in 9 patients with IP. Left and right facial widths at the level of the zygomatic arch were also evaluated. The Student t-test was used for paired to a 5% level of significance data. Results The lateral skeletal cephalometric findings were not statistically significant, but the Class II was the most frequent finding (44.4%), followed by Class III (33.3%) and Class I (22.2%). The right maxillo-mandibular width was significantly lower than normal values, and the right facial width was significantly higher than the left, at the level of the zygomatic arch. Conclusions Patients with IP showed more skeletal discrepancies of Class II and III than Class I malocclusion, and had significant horizontal facial skeletal asymmetries. This should alert health professionals to route these patients for orthodontic assessment and possible therapeutic interventions. However, larger samples are needed to better elucidate if these cephalometric findings can be specifically related to IP.

The study was conducted on a sample which consisted of 154 lateral cephalograms of children and adolescents aged 9-15 years (84 females and 70 males). The evaluation of skeletal maturation stage was performed using a visual morphological analysis of CS3 and CS4 cervical vertebrae. The sagittal skeletal relation was evaluated according to Steiner analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize chronological age in each malocclusion group and for each CS3 and CS4 skeletal maturation stage. Due to a lack of normal distribution, comparisons of CS3 and CS4 age intervals on class I and II subjects were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for independent samples. The results show that the mean duration of the adolescent peak growth spurt was 10 months between CS3 and CS4 stages in class I malocclusion subjects, whereas in class II malocclusion patients the duration was 6 months. This difference of 4 months was statistically significant (p<0.001). Finally, a clinically significant difference of 4 months in the duration of the adolescent peak growth spurt for class I and II malocclusion subjects was identified. [Fathers' and Mothers' Verbal Responsiveness and the Language Skills of Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25836377) Flippin, Michelle; Watson, Linda R 2015-08-01 In this observational study, we examined the interactions of 16 young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their parents to investigate (a) differences in verbal responsiveness used by fathers and mothers in interactions with their children with ASD and (b) concurrent associations between the language skills of children with ASD and the verbal responsiveness of both fathers and mothers. Parent verbal responsiveness was coded from video recordings of naturalistic parent-child play sessions using interval-based coding. Child language skills were measured by the Preschool Language Scale-Fourth Edition (Zimmerman, Steiner, & Pond, 2002). For both fathers and mothers, parent verbal responsiveness was positively associated with child language skills. Mothers' responsiveness was also significantly associated with child cognition. After controlling for child cognition, fathers' verbal responsiveness continued to be significantly related to child language skills. Although other studies have documented associations between mothers' responsiveness and child language, this is the 1st study to document a significant concurrent association between child language skills of children with ASD and the verbal responsiveness of fathers. Findings of this study warrant the inclusion of fathers in future research on language development and intervention to better understand the potential contributions fathers may make to language growth for children with ASD over time as well as to determine whether coaching fathers to use responsive verbal strategies can improve language outcomes for children with ASD. [An Adaptive Data Gathering Scheme for Multi-Hop Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Compressed Sensing and Network Coding.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043574) Yin, Jun; Yang, Yuwang; Wang, Lei 2016-04-01 Joint design of compressed sensing (CS) and network coding (NC) has been demonstrated to provide a new data gathering paradigm for multi-hop wireless sensor networks (WSNs). By exploiting the correlation of the network sensed data, a variety of data gathering schemes based on NC and CS (Compressed Data Gathering--CDG) have been proposed. However, these schemes assume that the sparsity of the network sensed data is constant and the value of the sparsity is known before starting each data gathering epoch, thus they ignore the variation of the data observed by the WSNs which are deployed in practical circumstances. In this paper, we present a complete design of the feedback CDG scheme where the sink node adaptively queries those interested nodes to acquire an appropriate number of measurements. The adaptive measurement-formation procedure and its termination rules are proposed and analyzed in detail. Moreover, in order to minimize the number of overall transmissions in the formation procedure of each measurement, we have developed a NP-complete model (Maximum Leaf Nodes Minimum Steiner Nodes--MLMS) and realized a scalable greedy algorithm to solve the problem. Experimental results show that the proposed measurement-formation method outperforms previous schemes, and experiments on both datasets from ocean temperature and practical network deployment also prove the effectiveness of our proposed feedback CDG scheme. [Connectivity Restoration in Wireless Sensor Networks via Space Network Coding.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28425923) Uwitonze, Alfred; Huang, Jiaqing; Ye, Yuanqing; Cheng, problem of finding the number and optimal positions of relay nodes for restoring the network connectivity in partitioned Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) and thus heuristic methods are preferred to solve it. This paper proposes a novel polynomial time heuristic algorithm, namely, Relay Placement using Space Network Coding (RPSNC), to solve this problem, where Space Network Coding, also called Space Information Flow (SIF), is a new research paradigm that studies network coding in Euclidean space, in which extra relay nodes can be introduced to reduce the cost of communication. Unlike contemporary schemes that are often based on Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), Euclidean Steiner Minimal Tree (ESMT) or a combination with ESMT, RPSNC is a new min-cost multicast space network coding approach that combines Delaunay triangulation and non-uniform partitioning techniques for generating a number of candidate relay nodes, and then linear programming is applied for choosing the optimal relay nodes and computing their connection links with terminals. Subsequently, an equilibrium method is used to refine the locations of the optimal relay nodes, by moving them to balanced positions. RPSNC can adapt to any density distribution of relay nodes and terminals, as well as any density distribution of terminals. The performance and complexity of RPSNC are analyzed and its performance is validated through simulation experiments. [Spatio-temporal clustering and density estimation of lightning data for the tracking of convective events](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AtmRe.134...87S) [NASA Astrophysics Stephan 2013-12-01 Convective cells are cloud formations whose growth, maturation and dissipation are of great interest among meteorologists since they are associated with severe storms with large precipitation structures. Some works suggest a strong correlation between lightning occurrence and convective cells. The current work proposes a new approach to analyze the correlation between precipitation and lightning, and to identify electrically active cells. Such cells may be employed for tracking convective events in the absence of weather radar coverage. This approach employs a new spatio-temporal clustering technique based on a temporal sliding-window and a standard kernel density estimation to process lightning data. Clustering allows the identification of the cells from lightning data and density estimation bounds the contours of the cells. The proposed approach was evaluated for two convective events in Southeast Brazil. Image segmentation of radar data was performed to identify convective precipitation structures using the Steiner criteria. These structures were then compared and correlated to the electrically active cells in particular instants of time for both events. It was observed that most precipitation structures have associated cells, by comparing the ground tracks of their centroids. In addition, for one particular cell of each event, its temporal evolution was compared to that of the associated precipitation structure. Results show that the proposed approach may improve the use of lightning data for tracking convective events in countries that lack weather radar coverage.

In this paper we have considered node mobility and try to find out simulation based comparison of the (SPT's) shortest path tree, (MST's) minimum steiner trees and minimum number of transmission trees in wireless mesh networks by using the performance metrics like as an end to end delay, average jitter, throughput and packet delivery ratio, average unicast packet delivery ratio, etc. We have also evaluated multicast performance in the small and large wireless mesh networks. In case of multicast performance in the small networks we have found that when the traffic load is moderate or high the SPTs outperform the MSTs and MNTs in all cases. The SPTs have lowest end to end delay and average jitter in almost all cases. In case of multicast performance in the large network we have seen that the MSTs provide minimum total edge cost and minimum number of transmissions. We have also found that the one drawback of SPTs, when the group size is large and rate of multicast sending is high SPTs causes more packet losses to other flows as MCTs. [Manual tracing versus smartphone Dara 2017-11-01 This study aimed to compare the results of conventional manual cephalometric tracing with those acquired with smartphone application cephalometric tracing. The cephalometric radiographs of 55 patients (25 females and 30 males) were traced via the manual and app methods and were subsequently examined with Steiner's analysis. Five skeletal measurements, five dental measurements and two soft tissue measurements were managed based on 21 landmarks. The durations of the performances of the two methods were also compared. SNA (Sella, Nasion, A point angle) and SNB (Sella, Nasion, B point angle) values for the manual method were statistically lower (p < .001) than those for the app method. The ANB value for the manual method was statistically lower than that of app method. L1-NB (\u00b0) and upper lip protrusion values for the manual method were statistically higher than those for the app method. Go-GN/SN, U1-NA (\u00b0) and U1-NA (mm) values for manual method were statistically lower than those for the app method. No differences between the two methods were found in the L1-NB (mm), occlusal plane to SN, interincisal angle or lower lip protrusion values. Although statistically significant differences were found between the two methods, the cephalometric tracing proceeded faster with the app method than with the manual method. [New Planar Wire Array Experiments on the LTD Generator at U Michigan](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014APS..DPPJP8102W) [NASA Astrophysics Data System D. A.; R. M. 2014-10-01 Experiments on planar wire array z-pinches have been carried out on the MAIZE Linear Transformer Driver (LTD) generator at the University of Michigan (UM) for the first time. Specifically, Al (Al 5056, 95% Al, 5% Mg) double planar wire arrays (DPWAs) comprising six wires in each plane with interplanar gaps of 3.0 mm and 6.0 mm and interwire gaps of 0.7 mm and 1.0 mm were imploded with x-ray time-integrated spectra indicating electron temperatures of over 450 eV for K-shell Al and Mg, while producing mostly optically thin lines. In addition to x-ray time-integrated spectra, the diagnostics included x-ray time-integrated pinhole cameras, two silicon diodes, and shadowgraphy, which are analyzed and compared. The MAIZE LTD is capable of supplying up 1.0 MA, 100 kV pulses with 100 ns rise time into a matched load. However, for these experiments the LTD was charged to +-70 kV resulting in up to 0.5 MA with a current rise time of approximately 150 ns. Future experiments and the importance of studying planar wire arrays on LTD devices are discussed. This work supported by NNSA under DOE Cooperative Agreement DE-NA0001984. S. Patel & A.

A review of the classical and quantum action principles,\" Rev. Mod. Phys. 29, 377-397 (1957)] has two practical advantages over the traditional methods of \"lattice approximations;\" there is no ordering problem, and classical symmetries are manifestly preserved at the quantum level. Applying the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators, we provide a rigorous proof of the convergence of certain path integrals on Riemann surfaces of constant curvature -1. The Pauli-DeWitt curvature correction term arises, as in DeWitt's work. Introducing a Fuchsian group of the first kind, and a continuous, bounded, -automorphic potential V, we obtain a Feynman-Kac formula for the automorphic Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the Riemann surface H. We analyze the Wick rotation and prove the strong convergence of the so-called Feynman maps [K. D.

A Fenglei; Yin, Xia; Yu, Jianyong; Ding, Bin 2017-03-01 The filtration capacity of fibrous media for airborne particles is restricted by their thick diameter, low porosity, and limited frontal area. The ability to solve this problem would have broad technological implications for various air filtration applications; despite many past efforts, it remains a great challenge to achieve. Herein, a facile and scalable strategy to fabricate the ripple-like polyamide-6 nanofiber/nets (PA-6 NF/N) air filter via combining electrospinning/netting technique with receiving substrate design is demonstrated. This proposed approach allows the scaffold filaments to orderly embed into 2D PA-6 nanonets layer with Steiner-tree structures and nanoscale diameter of 20 nm, resulting in the ripple-like membrane with extremely small pore size, highly porous structure, and hugely extended frontal surface, by facilely adjusting its pleat span and pleat pitch. These unique structural advantages enable the ripple-like PA-6 NF/N filter to filtrate the ultrafine particles with high removal efficiency of 99.996%, low air resistance of 95 Pa, and robust quality factor of >0.11 Pa -1 ; using its superlight weight of 0.9 g m -2 and physical sieving manner. This approach has the potentialities to give rise to a novel generation of filter media displaying enhanced filtration capacity for various applications thanks to their nanoscale features and designed or a pulsator in disguise. II. The spectroscopy](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A%26A...385..600V) [NASA Astrophysics Data der Hucht, K. A. 2002-04-01 , we discern a flaring behaviour, i.e., an emission bump appeared on the blue wing of two He Ii-lines (around -1700 km s-1) lasting less than 5 min. Finally, the line fluxes follow the observed brightenings, also on a time scale of years. We conclude that the short-term cyclic variability confirms the WR nature as established from the WR standard model analysis by Crowther et al. (\\\\cite{Crowther95}; hereafter referred to as CSH). The various time-delay effects are consistent with the formation of the spectrum in a stratified stellar wind. The outer layers trail the inner ones. The variability is inconsistent with the formation of the spectrum in a stellar disc as proposed by Niemela et al. (\\\\cite{Niemela95}) and Steiner & Diaz (\\\\cite{Steiner98}). The long-term cyclic variability of the brightness and line fluxes is related to an increase of the mass-loss-rate, and, possibly, to the period changes. The interpretation of the nature of the variability is deferred to Veen et al. (\\\\cite{Veen02b}, Paper III).

[Fathers' and Mothers' Verbal Responsiveness and the Language Skills of Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4657522) Watson, Linda R. 2015-01-01 Purpose In this observational study, we examined the interactions of 16 young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their parents to investigate (a) differences in verbal responsiveness used by fathers and mothers in interactions with their children with ASD and (b) concurrent associations between the language skills of children with ASD and the verbal responsiveness of both fathers and mothers. Method Parent verbal responsiveness was coded from video recordings of naturalistic parent-child play sessions using interval-based coding. Child language skills were measured by the Preschool Language Scale-Fourth Edition (Zimmerman, Steiner, & Pond, 2002). Results For both fathers and mothers, parent verbal responsiveness was positively associated with child language skills. Mothers' responsiveness was also significantly associated with child cognition. After controlling for child cognition, fathers' verbal responsiveness continued to be significantly related to child language skills. Conclusions Although other studies have documented associations between mothers' responsiveness and child language, this is the 1st study to document a significant concurrent association between child language skills of children with ASD and the verbal responsiveness of fathers. Findings of this study warrant the inclusion of fathers in future research on language development and intervention to better understand the potential contributions fathers may make to language growth for children with ASD over time as well as to determine whether coaching fathers to use responsive verbal strategies can improve language outcomes for children with ASD. PMID:25836377 [The Laws of Nature and the Effectiveness of Mathematics](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005trom.book..131D) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Dorato, Mauro In this paper I try to evaluate what I regard as the main attempts at explaining the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences, namely (1) Antinaturalism, (2) Kantism, (3) Semanticism, (4) Algorithmic Complexity Theory. The first position has been defended by Mark Steiner, who claims that the \"user friendliness\" of nature for the applied mathematician is the best argument against a naturalistic explanation of the origin of the universe. The second is naturalistic and mixes the Kantian tradition with evolutionary studies about our innate mathematical abilities. The third turns to the Fregean tradition and considers mathematics a particular kind of language, thus treating the effectiveness of mathematics as a particular instance of the effectiveness of natural languages. The fourth hypothesis, building on formal results by Kolmogorov, Solomonov and Chaitin, claims that mathematics is so useful in describing the natural world because it is the science of the abbreviation of sequences, and mathematically formulated laws of nature enable us to compress the information contained in the sequence of numbers in which we code our observations. In this tradition, laws are equivalent to the shortest algorithms capable of generating the lists of zeros and ones representing the empirical data. Along the way, I present and reject the \"deflationary explanation\", which claims that in wondering about the applicability of so many mathematical structures to nature, we tend to forget the many cases in which no application is possible. [Exact and heuristic algorithms for Space Information Flow.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29584729) 2018-01-01 Space Information Flow (SIF) is a new promising research area that studies network coding in geometric space, such as Euclidean space. The design of algorithms that compute the optimal SIF solutions remains one of the key open problems in SIF. This work proposes the first exact SIF algorithm and a heuristic SIF algorithm that compute min-cost multicast network coding for N (N 3) given terminal nodes in 2-D Euclidean space. Furthermore, we find that the Butterfly network in Euclidean space is the second example besides the Pentagram network where SIF is strictly better than Euclidean Steiner minimal tree. The exact algorithm design is based on two key techniques: Delaunay triangulation and linear programming. Delaunay triangulation technique helps to find practically good candidate relay nodes, after which a min-cost multicast linear programming model is solved over the terminal nodes and the candidate relay nodes, to compute the optimal multicast network topology, including the optimal relay nodes selected by linear programming from all the candidate relay nodes and the flow rates on the connection links. The heuristic algorithm design is also based on Delaunay triangulation and linear programming techniques. The exact algorithm can achieve the optimal SIF solution with an exponential computational complexity, while the heuristic algorithm can achieve the sub-optimal SIF solution with a polynomial computational complexity. We prove the correctness of the exact SIF algorithm. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the heuristic SIF algorithm. [Stochastic behaviour of tropical convection in [NASA stochastic multicloud model (SMCM, Khouider et al. (2010)) to represent observed tropical convection over a northern Australia coastal site is investigated. In the SMCM, area fractions of three cloud types associated with tropical convection (congestus, deep convection and stratiform) are derived employing a coarse grained birth-death process which is evolved in time using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Here, we force the SMCM with an observed large-scale atmospheric state to assess the feasibility of applying the model's underlying design concept to simulate observed tropical convection. The observational dataset we use here represents the best estimate of the atmospheric state for a 190x190 km2 area centered over Darwin, Australia (Jakob et al., 2011). Cloud area fractions are derived from CPOL radar following Steiner et al. (1995). We use different combinations of predictors derived from the observations (e.g. CAPE, low-level CAPE, moisture convergence, mid-tropospheric relative humidity) to obtain the evolution of the cloud ensemble as simulated by the SMCM. We find that the diagnostic performance of the SMCM depends strongly on the predictor choice and that it performs remarkably well when initiation and maintenance of convection are prescribed to depend on measures related to changes in low-level moisture. This is an encouraging result on the road towards a novel convection parameterization, aimed at overcoming the difficulties of current deterministic convection parameterizations in representing the high variability in simulated tropical convection. [Mass and Radius Constraints Using Magnetar Giant Flare Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) T.; Steiner, A. W.; Brown, E. F. 2013-04-01 We extend the study of oscillating neutron stars to include observed magnetic field strengths. The strong magnetic field will alter the equilibrium composition of the outer neutron star crust. We construct a new neutron star crust model which predicts nuclear masses with an accuracy very close to that of the Finite Range Droplet Model. The mass model for equilibrium nuclei also includes recent developments in the nuclear physics, in particular, shell corrections and an updated neutron-drip line. We perturb our crust model to predict axial crust modes and assign them to observed giant flare quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequencies from SGR 1806-20. The QPOs associated with the fundamental and harmonic crust modes can be used to constrain magnetar masses and radii. We use these modes and the phenomenological equations of state from Steiner et al. to find a magnetar crust which reproduces observations of SGR 1806-20. We find magnetar crusts which match observations for various magnetic field strengths and values of entrainment of the free neutron gas in the inner crust. For a crust without a magnetic field we obtain the approximate values of M = 1.35 Msun and R = 11.85 km. For a magnetized crust with the surface dipole field of SGR 1806-20 we obtain the approximate values of M = 1.25 Msun and R = 12.41 km. If there is less entrainment of the free neutron gas the magnetar requires a larger mass and radius to reproduce observations.

[[Growth and photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii in seedlings of two varieties of Capsicum arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are a biological alternative for the sustainable management of Capsicum annuum L. This research work evaluated the effects of both PGPR and AMF on bell pepper and jalapeno pepper plants. Five bacterial strains isolated from several locations in Estado de Mexico were three treatments with AMF [H1 (consortium isolated from pepper crops in the State of Puebla), H2 (Rhizophagus intraradices), and H3 (consortium isolated from the rhizosphere of lemon trees, State of Tabasco)]. In addition, a fertilized treatment (Steiner nutrient solution at 25%) and an unfertilized control were included. Seedlings of \"Caloro\" jalapeno pepper and \"California Wonder\" bell pepper were inoculated with AMF at seed sowing, and PGPR were inoculated after 15 days of seedling emergence; seedlings were grown under plant growth chamber conditions. P61 bacterium and H1 AMF consortia were the most effective microorganisms for jalapeno pepper whereas R44 bacterium and AMF H3 and H1 were the most effective for bell peppers, when compared to the unfertilized control. Furthermore, P61 and R44 bacteria showed beneficial effects on PSII efficiency. Copyright \u00a9 Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Elsevier Espa\u00f1a, All rights reserved. [Integrated systems biology analysis of KSHV latent infection reveals viral induction and reliance on agent of Kaposi's Sarcoma the most common tumor of AIDS patients world-wide. KSHV is predominantly latent in the main KS tumor cell, the spindle cell, a cell of endothelial origin. KSHV modulates numerous host cell-signaling pathways to activate endothelial cells including major metabolic pathways involved in lipid metabolism. To identify the underlying cellular mechanisms of KSHV alteration of host signaling and endothelial cell activation, we identified changes in the host proteome, phosphoproteome and transcriptome landscape following KSHV infection of endothelial cells. A Steiner forest algorithm was used to integrate the global data sets and, together with transcriptome based predicted transcription factor activity, cellular networks altered by latent KSHV were predicted. Several interesting pathways were identified, including peroxisome biogenesis. To validate the predictions, we showed that KSHV latent infection increases the number of peroxisomes per cell. Additionally, proteins involved in peroxisomal lipid metabolism of very long chain fatty acids, including ABCD3 and ACOX1, are required for the survival of latently infected cells. In summary, novel cellular pathways altered during herpesvirus latency that could not be predicted by a single systems biology platform, were identified by integrated proteomics and transcriptomics data analysis and when correlated with our metabolomics data revealed that peroxisome lipid metabolism is essential for KSHV latent infection of endothelial cells. PMID:28257516 one of the most common malignant tumors that carry a poor prognosis. To improve the long-term outlook for HCC, an accurate prognosis is important. To study the immunohistochemical expressions of p53, Ki67, Bcl-2, VEGF and PCNA and their potential role as prognostic factors in patients with radical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma. Forty-seven formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples from patients with HCC receiving liver resection were investigated immunohistochemically for the expression of cellular proliferation markers PCNA, Ki67, p53, Bcl-2 and VEGF and their correlation with tumor characteristics and survival time after resection. p53 was expressed in a higher percentage (85.7 vs. 42.1%) in undifferentiated histological tumor grades (Edmondson Steiner G3/G4 vs. G1/G2). Patients with p53 accumulating tumors showed a worse survival than patients with p53 non-accumulating tumors (median 9.5 vs. 16.5 months). Over-expression of VEGF was found in 38.3% of all HCCs. VEGF expression was significantly correlated with p53 expression and recurrence rates. The results showed that the labeling index of PCNA and expression of p53 are correlated. The high labeling index of PCNA or over-expression of p53 resulted in high risk of tumor recurrence, more aggressive growth and poor survival. High labeling index of PCNA, p53 nuclear accumulation and VEGF high expression are associated with poor survival in patients with HCC. [Reconstruction of the temporal signaling a bacterial pathogen that usually infects its host through food sources. Translocation of the pathogen proteins into the host cells leads to changes in the signaling mechanism either by activating or inhibiting the host proteins. Given that the bacterial infection modifies the response network of the host, a more coherent view of the underlying biological processes and the signaling networks can be obtained by using a network modeling approach based on the reverse engineering principles. In this work, we have used a published temporal phosphoproteomic dataset of Salmonella-infected human cells and reconstructed the temporal signaling network of the human host by integrating the interactome and the phosphoproteomic dataset. We have combined two well-established network modeling frameworks, the Prize-collecting Steiner Forest (PCSF) approach and the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based edge inference approach. The resulting network conserves the information on temporality, direction of interactions, while revealing hidden entities in the signaling, such as the SNARE binding, mTOR signaling, immune response, cytoskeleton organization, and apoptosis pathways. Targets of the Salmonella effectors in the host cells such as CDC42, RHOA, 14-3-3, Syntaxin family, Oxysterol-binding proteins were included in the reconstructed signaling network although they were not present in the initial phosphoproteomic data. We believe that integrated approaches, such as the one presented here, have a high potential for the identification of clinical targets in infectious diseases, especially in the Salmonella infections.

[Gingival Zenith Positions and Levels of Maxillary Anterior parameters, such as gingival zenith positions (GZPs) and gingival zenith levels (GZLs), anterior bimaxillary protrusion cases and collate it with severiety of crown inclination. Gingival zenith position and GZL in 40 healthy patients (29 females and 11 males) with an average age of 21.5 years were assessed. Inclusion criteria involved absence of periodontal diseases, Angle's class I molar relationship, and upper anterior proclination within 25 to 45\u00b0 based on Steiner's analysis; exclusion criteria included spacing, crowding, anterior restoration and teeth with incisor attrition or rotation. The GZP was evaluated using digital calipers from voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and GZL was assessed from the tangent drawn from GZP of central incisor and canines to the linear vertical distance of GZP of lateral incisor. All the central incisors showed a GZP distal to VBM with a mean average of 1 mm. Severe proclination between 40 and 45\u00b0 showed a statistically significant variation. Lateral incisors displayed a mean of 0.5 mm deviation of GZP from the vertically bisected midline. In 80% of canine population, GZP was centralized. We conclude that the degree of proclination of maxillary anterior dentition was correlated to the gingival contour in bimaxillary cases. The investigation revealed that there is a variation in the location of GZP as the severity of proclination increases. This study highlights the importance of microesthetics in fixed orthodontic treatment. The gingival contour should be unaltered while retraction during management of bimaxillary protrusion. [The Confluence Johannes 2018-01-01 The processual relation of thinking and perceiving shall be examined from a historical perspective as well as on the basis of methodically conducted first-person observation. Historically, these two psychological aspects of human knowledge and corresponding philosophical positions have predominant alternating phases. At certain historical points, thinking and perceiving tend to converge, while in the interim phases they seem to diverge with an emphasis on one of them. While at the birth of modern science, for instance, these two forms of mental life were deeply interlinked, today they seem to be separated more than ever before - as a number of scientific crises have shown. Turning from the outer to the inner aspect of this issue, a phenomenological view becomes relevant. In terms of the consciousness phenomenology developed by Steiner (1861-1925) and Witzenmann's (1905-1988) Structure Phenomenology, this article will show how a methodical integration of thinking and perceiving can be carried out on the basis of first-person observation. In the course of a skilled introspective or meditative self-observation the individual's own mental micro-actions of separating and integrating come into view, jointly constituting what we usually call thinking and perceiving. Consequently, this approach includes a conceptual as well as a perceptual dimension the experimental confluence of which ties in with the methodological core principle of modern natural science. At the same time, making this principle explicit may open the way to a further development of human consciousness and its scientific delineation. PMID:29375432 [At the intersection of toxicology, psychiatry, and T 2013-09-01 Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is a genetic disorder involving a mutation of the ornithine transcarbamylase gene, located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp21.1). This makes the expression of the gene most common in homozygous males, but heterozygous females can also be affected and may be more likely to suffer from serious morbidity. Most males present early in the neonatal period with more devastating outcomes than their female counterparts. Up to 34% will present in the first 30 days of life (J Pediatr 2001;138:S30). Females often have partially functioning mitochondria due to uneven distribution of the mutant gene secondary to lyonization (\"X-chromosome Inactivation\". Genetics Home Reference, 2012). Occasionally, symptomatic females may not even present until they are placed under metabolic stress such as a severe illness, fasting, pregnancy, or new medication (Roth KS, Steiner RD. \"Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency\". EMedicine, 2012). The urea cycle is the body's primary tool for the disposal of excess nitrogen, which is generated by the routine metabolism of proteins and amino acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction impairs urea production and result in hyperammonemia (Semin Neonatol 2002;7:27). The sine qua non among all degrees of OTC deficiency at presentation is hyperammonemia. As in adults, children will have similar symptoms of encephalopathy, but this may be expressed differently depending on the child's developmental level. We present an unusual case of OTC deficiency in an older child with undifferentiated symptoms of an anticholinergic toxidrome, liver failure, iron overdose, and mushroom poisoning. [Prevalence and predictors of premenstrual aimed at assessing the prevalence of premenstrual symptoms and of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in a population-based sample of women of the entire reproductive age range, as well as to analyse predictors of PMS and PMDD in terms of socio-demographic, health status and health behavioural factors. A set of questions on PMS-based on the premenstrual syndrome screening tool developed by Steiner et al., translated into German and piloted-was integrated into the written questionnaire of the 2007 Swiss Health Survey. Weighted prevalence rates and multivariable regression analysis for the outcome variables PMS and PMDD were calculated. A total of 3,913 women aged 15 to 54 years answered the questions on PMS symptoms, and 3,522 of them additionally answered the questions on interference of PMS with life. Ninety one percent of the participants reported at least one symptom, 10.3% had PMS and 3.1% fulfilled the criteria for PMDD. The prevalence of PMS was higher in non-married women, in women aged 35-44 years and in women of the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland. Both PMS and PMDD were strongly associated with poor physical health and psychological distress. Socio-cultural factors seem to determine the prevalence, perception and handling of PMS. Considering the association with poor physical health and high psychological distress, a broader underlying vulnerability in women qualifying for PMDD must be assumed and should be taken into account in clinical management as well as in future research in this field. [Observing atmospheric blocking with GPS radio occultation - one decade of measurements](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..1913099B) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Brunner, Lukas; Steiner, Andrea 2017-04-01 Atmospheric blocking has received a lot of attention in recent years due to its impact on mid-latitude circulation and subsequently on weather extremes such as cold and warm spells. So far blocking studies have been based mainly on re-analysis data or model output. However, it has been shown that blocking frequency exhibits considerable inter-model spread in current climate models. Here we use one decade (2006 to 2016) of satellite-based observations from GPS radio occultation (RO) to analyze blocking in RO data building on work by Brunner et al. (2016). Daily fields on a 2.5\u00b0\u00d72.5\u00b0 longitude-latitude grid are calculated by applying an adequate gridding strategy to the RO measurements. For blocking detection we use a standard blocking detection algorithm based on 500 hPa geopotential height (GPH) gradients. We investigate vertically resolved atmospheric variables such as GPH, temperature, and water vapor before, during, and after blocking events to increase process understanding. Moreover, utilizing the coverage of the RO data set, we investigate global blocking frequencies. The main blocking regions in the northern and southern hemisphere are identified and the (vertical) atmospheric structure linked to blocking events is compared. Finally, an inter-comparison of results from RO data to different re-analyses, such as ERA-Interim, MERRA 2, and JRA-55, is presented. Brunner, L., A. K. Steiner, B. Scherllin-Pirscher, and M. W.

[Influence of alternative lifestyles on self-reported body weight in Thijs, Carel 2014-04-01 Alternative lifestyles are often associated with distinct practices with respect to nutrition, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use and usage of complementary medicine. Evidence concerning effects of these lifestyle-related practices on health status is still fragmentary. To describe maternal health characteristics related to alternative lifestyles, with emphasis on body-weight status, during pregnancy and maternity periods. We compared self-reported health-related features of mothers with alternative lifestyles and conventional lifestyles during pregnancy and maternity period in the KOALA Birth Cohort Study. This cohort comprises two recruitment groups of mother-infant pairs, one with a conventional (no selection based on lifestyle, n = 2333), the other with an alternative lifestyle (selected via organic food shops, anthroposophic clinicians and midwives, anthroposophic under-five clinics, Rudolf Steiner schools and relevant magazines, n = 485). Mothers in the alternative group more frequently chose organic foods, adhered to specific living rules, practised vegetarianism and identified themselves with anthroposophy. Mothers in the alternative group showed lower BMI and lower prevalence of overweight and obesity than the conventional group, before pregnancy as well as 4-5 years after delivery. This difference was partly retained after adjusting for potential confounders. Furthermore, women in the alternative group had a lower prevalence of pregnancy-related hypertension, more often started breastfeeding and gave exclusive and prolonged breastfeeding for a longer period. Finally, they smoked less often, but more often drunk alcohol during pregnancy. The results suggest that an alternative lifestyle is associated with favourable body weight and with several differences in other health features. [Fatal pyogranulomatous myocarditis in 10 of 5 years, 10 pure-bred Boxer puppies, 9-16 weeks old, were presented with a history of sudden death and were diagnosed with pyogranulomatous myocarditis. The myocarditis was characterized by a mixed infiltrate composed predominantly of neutrophils and macrophages. In our retrospective study, original case records and archived materials were examined. All dogs were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi on immunohistochemistry (IHC). There was no evidence of infectious agents in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) heart tissue sections stained caninum, West Nile virus, and canine parvovirus also yielded a negative result in all dogs. Polymerase chain reaction testing for vector-borne pathogens on heart tissue from 9 of the dogs (1 frozen and 8 FFPE samples) yielded positive results for 1 dog with B. burgdorferi as well as Anaplasma phagocytophilum in another dog. Subsequently, 2 additional cases were found in a French Bulldog and a French Bulldog-Beagle mix that had identical morphology, test results, age, and seasonality to these 10 Boxer dogs. The similarities in the seasonality, signalment of the affected dogs, and the gross and microscopic lesions suggest a common etiology. Positive IHC and morphologic similarities to human Lyme carditis indicate that B. burgdorferi is likely the agent involved. An additional consideration for these cases is the possibility of a breed-specific autoimmune myocarditis or potential predisposition for cardiopathogenic agents in young Boxers. \u00a9 2016 The Author(s).

The system consists of 200 MSGC chambers of sizes up to 30 \u00d7 30 cm 2 with a total of 150 000 electronic channels. Rates up to 10 4 s -1 mm -2 have to be handled. The gold electrodes (300 m pitch) are produced by a lift-off process on an alkali-free glass (300 m thick). The glass is CVD coated with amorphous carbon with a surface resistivity of 10 14/. It provides the required lifetime of 5 years with an integrated charge of 30 mC per cm of the anode length. Gains > 5000 are obtained. The efficiency is greater than 99% with negligible noise rate. Measures to avoid deterioration of the anodes by discharges caused by heavy ionizing particles are discussed. The MSGC detectors are connected to hybrid electronics via Kapton foils. A special bonding machine has been built which allows the adjustment by a video system and the chariots moved by micrometer screws and contains electronically steered glue dispenser and pressure pistons. Members of the collaboration are: T. Beckmann, C. Bresch, A. Maag, V. Myalitsin, P. Robmann, B. Schmidt, S. U. Straumann, P. Tru\u00f6l, S. Visbeck, A.-H. Zeuner. [Philosophy of Science and Education](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012Sc%26Ed..21.1055J) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Jung, Walter 2012-08-01 This is a vast and vague topic. In order to do justice to it one has to write a book or maybe more than one. For it can be understood in quite different ways and on different levels For example you may think mainly of the historical aspect, that is how philosophy of science developed in the last hundred or so years and how its influence on education changed; you may think of quite different schools of philosophy, from Marxist or positivist to such exotic but at some places influential philosophic positions like that of Rudolph Steiner; of course, you may limit the subject to special fields like epistemology, theory of scientific methodology, or, what has become fashionable recently, sociology of knowledge which may have a considerable bearing on physics teaching (Collins and Shapin 1983; Jung 1985). Again we may think of the topic treated by a philosopher, a scientist, an educationalist, a teacher, which would mean quite a difference. I am trying here to speak as an educationalist, with the physics teacher in mind: this is my vocational perspective as someone who educates physics teachers. Of course, our main concern is the contribution of science, especially physics, to general education, which integrates many of the special topics mentioned. Philosophy of science comes in because it is not at all clear what science and physics is, and what of it should be taught, and how such chosen parts should be taught. I also take this opportunity to give an idea of the longstanding tradition of this discussion in Germany, connected with names like Wagenshein, Litt, Heisenberg and many others. [Unconscious phantasy as a structural principle and organizer of mental life: The evolution of a concept from Freud to Klein and some of her successors.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28211036) Weiss, Heinz 2017-06-01 Starting with Freud's discovery of unconscious phantasy as a means of accessing his patients' internal world, the author discusses the evolution of the concept in the work of Melanie Klein and some of her successors. Whereas Freud sees phantasy as a wish fulfilling imagination, dominated by primary process functioning and kept apart from reality testing, Klein understands phantasies as a structural function and organizer of mental life. From their very beginnings they involve object relations and gradually evolve from primitive body-near experiences to images and symbolic representations. With her concept of projective identification in particular, Klein anticipates the communicative function of unconscious phantasies. They are at the basis of processes of symbolization, but may also be put into the service of complex defensive operations. The author traces the further evolution of the concept from the contributions of S. Isaacs, the theories of thinking proposed by W.R. Bion and R. Money-Kyrle, Hanna Segal's ideas on symbolization and reparation all the way to the latest approaches by R. Britton, J. Steiner and others, including the understanding of transference and counter-transference as a 'total situation'. Points of contact with Freud are to be found particularly in connection with his concept of 'primal phantasies'. In the author's view, the idea of the transmission and communicative potential of unconscious phantasies enabled these authors to overcome the solipsistic origins of drive theory in favour of a notion in which unconscious phantasies both set down the coordinates of the inner world and form and reflect the matrix of inter-subjective relations.

[Evaluation of the closest speaking space in different speaking space (CSS) together with the vertical overlap of anterior teeth during the production of the /s/ sound have not been previously investigated with respect to differences in dental and skeletal orthodontic classifications. The purpose of this study was to investigate the CSS in dental and skeletal occlusions and to analyze the cause and effect relationship of the CSS and the amount of the vertical overlap of anterior teeth. Poly vinylsiloxane interocclusal registration material was placed bilaterally onto the occlusal surfaces of premolar and molar teeth of 155 native Turkish speaking adolescent and young adult dentate participants, who were then asked to pronounce the word seyis. The thinnest point between the maxillary and mandibular teeth was recorded in millimeters as the CSS. The occlusion of each participant was classified according to the Angle dental and Steiner skeletal classifications. The differences in CSS values within each classification were statistically analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the correlation between the CSS and the vertical overlap was statistically analyzed with the Spearman Rho Correlation tests (P<.05). The differences in the CSS were only significant between Angle Class II division 2 and Class III groups (P=.034), while the differences in the CSS between skeletal classes were not significant. The correlation between the amount of CSS and the amount of vertical overlap was not significant. The results showed that regardless of dental and skeletal occlusions, average CSS values could be used to determine the occlusal vertical dimension of prosthetic restorations.

[Multicasting for high bandwidth and the long session duration requirements of the application scenarios such as interactive distance learning or on-line diagnosis of patients simultaneously in different hospitals. However, multifiber and limited sparse light splitting and wavelength conversion capabilities of switches result in a difficult optimization problem. We attack this problem using a layered graph model. The problem is defined as a k-edge-disjoint degree-constrained Steiner tree problem for routing and fiber and wavelength assignment of k multicasts. A mixed integer linear programming formulation for the problem is given, and a solution using CPLEX is provided. However, the complexity of the problem grows quickly with respect to the number of edges in the layered graph, which depends on the number of nodes, fibers, wavelengths, and multicast sessions. Hence, we propose two heuristics layered all-optical multicast algorithm [(LAMA) and conservative fiber and wavelength assignment (C-FWA)] to compare with CPLEX, existing work, and unicasting. Extensive computational experiments show that LAMA's performance is very close to CPLEX, and it is significantly better than existing work and C-FWA for nearly all metrics, since LAMA jointly optimizes routing and fiber-wavelength assignment phases compared with the other candidates, which attack the problem by decomposing two phases. Experiments also show that important metrics (e.g., session and group blocking probability, transmitter wavelength, and fiber conversion resources) are adversely affected by the separation of two phases. Finally, the fiber-wavelength assignment strategy of C-FWA (Ex-Fit) uses wavelength and fiber conversion resources more effectively than the First Fit. [A novel network analysis approach reveals DNA damage, oxidative the form of neurodegenerative dementia with the highest prevalence after Alzheimer's disease, equally distributed in men and women. It includes several variants, generally characterized by behavioural instability and language impairments. Although few mendelian genes (MAPT, GRN, and C9orf72) have been associated to the FTD phenotype, in most cases there is only evidence of multiple risk loci with relatively small effect size. To date, there are no comprehensive studies describing FTD at molecular level, highlighting possible genetic interactions and signalling pathways at the origin FTD-associated neurodegeneration. In this study, we designed a broad FTD genetic interaction map of the Italian population, through a novel network-based approach modelled on the concepts of disease-relevance and interaction perturbation, combining Steiner tree search and Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis. Our results show a strong connection between Calcium/cAMP metabolism, oxidative stress-induced Serine/Threonine kinases activation, and postsynaptic membrane potentiation, suggesting a possible combination of neuronal damage and loss of neuroprotection, leading to cell death. In our model, Calcium/cAMP homeostasis and energetic metabolism impairments are primary causes of loss of neuroprotection and neural cell damage, respectively. Secondly, the altered postsynaptic membrane potentiation, due to the activation of stress-induced Serine/Threonine kinases, leads to neurodegeneration. Our study investigates the molecular underpinnings of these processes, evidencing key genes and gene interactions that may account for a significant fraction of unexplained FTD aetiology. We emphasized the key molecular actors in these processes, proposing them as novel FTD biomarkers that could be crucial for further epidemiological and molecular studies. PMID:29020091 [Fulfillment of the premenstrual dysphoric disorder criteria confirmed using a self-rating questionnaire among depressive disorders experience severe premenstrual symptoms. However, there have been few studies in which premenstrual symptoms in women suffering from depressive disorders were assessed. In this study, we aimed to investigate premenstrual symptoms in women with depressive disorders using the premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) scale. We administered questionnaires to 65 Japanese female outpatients who had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder or dysthymic disorder and to 303 healthy women as control subjects. The questionnaire consisted of items on demographics and the PMDD scale, which was modified from the premenstrual symptoms screening tool (PSST) developed by Steiner et al. (Arch Womens Ment Health 2003, 6:203-209). Twenty-eight women (43.1%) with depressive disorder fulfilled certain items of the PMDD scale. These women are considered to have coexisting PMDD and a depressive disorder, or to have premenstrual exacerbation (PME) of a depressive disorder. On the other hand, 18 women (5.9%) in the control group were diagnosed as having PMDD. The depressive disorder group who fulfilled the PMDD criteria had more knowledge of the term premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and took more actions to attenuate premenstrual symptoms than the control group with PMDD. Our findings demonstrated that the occurrence of severe premenstrual symptoms is much higher in women with depressive disorders than in healthy subjects. This is partially due to this group containing women with PME, but mainly due to it containing women with PMDD. The higher percentage of PMDD suggests similarity between PMDD and other depressive disorders. Furthermore, educating healthy Japanese women and women with depressive disorders about premenstrual symptoms and evidence-based treatment for them is necessary.

PMID:21535889 [Toward Understanding the Nature of a Partnership Between an Elementary Classroom Teacher and an Informal Science Educator](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013JSTEd..24.1333W) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Weiland, Ingrid S.; Akerson, Valarie L. 2013-12-01 This study explored the nature of the relationship between a fifth-grade teacher and an informal science educator as they planned and implemented a life science unit in the classroom, and sought to define this relationship in order to gain insight into the roles of each educator. In addition, student learning as a result of instruction was assessed. Prior research has predominately examined relationships and roles of groups of teachers and informal educators in the museum setting (Tal et al. in Sci Educ 89:920-935, 2005; Tal and Steiner Technol Educ 6:25-46, 2006; Tran 2007). The current study utilized case study methodology to examine one relationship (between two educators) in more depth and in a different setting\u2014an elementary classroom. The relationship was defined through a framework of cooperation, coordination, and collaboration (Buck 1998; Intriligator 1986, 1992) containing eight dimensions. Findings suggest a relationship of coordination, which requires moderate commitment, risk, negotiation, and involvement, and examined the roles that each educator played and how they negotiated these roles. Consistent with previous examinations in science education of educator roles, the informal educator's role was to provide the students with expertise and resources not readily available to them. The roles played by the classroom teacher included classroom management, making connections to classroom activities and curricula, and clarifying concepts. Both educators' perceptions suggested they were at ease with their roles and that they felt these roles were critical to the optimization of the short time frames (1 h) the informal educator was in the classroom. Pre and posttest tests demonstrated students learned as a result of the programs. [Confirmation and revision on the orbital period change of the possible type Ia supernova progenitor V617 Sagittarii](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASJ...66....8S) variable V617 Sagittarii (V617 analyzed the orbital period change of V617 Sgr by employing three new (since 2010) CCD eclipse timings along with all the available data from the literature. It was found that the orbital period of V617 Sgr undergoes an obvious long-term increase, which confirms the result revealed by Steiner et al. (2006). The rate of orbital period increase was calculated to be {dot{P}} = +2.14(0.05) \u00d7 10-7 d yr-1. This suggests the lifetime of the secondary star will end in a timescale of 0.97 \u00d7 106 yr faster than that predicted previously. In particular, a cyclic variation with a period of 4.5 yr and an amplitude of 2.3 min may appear in the O - C diagram. Dominated by the wind-accretion mechanism, high mass transfer from the low mass secondary to the white dwarf is expected to continue in the V Sge-type star V617 Sgr during its long-term evolution. The mass transfer rate |skew4dot{M}_{ tr}| was estimated to be in the range of about 2.2 \u00d7 10-7 to 5.2 \u00d7 10-7 M yr-1. Accordingly, the already massive ( 1.2 M) white dwarf primary will process stable nuclear burning, accrete a fraction of the mass from its companion to reach the standard Chandrasekhar mass limit ( 1.38 M), and ultimately produce a type Ia supernova (SN Ia) within about 4-8 \u00d7 105 yr or earlier. [Investigating the impact of atmospheric blocking on temperature extremes across Europe using an objective index](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..1912277B) [NASA 2017-04-01 Atmospheric blocking is a key contributor to European temperature extremes. It leads to stable, long-lasting weather patterns, which favor the development of cold and warm spells. The link between blocking and such temperature extremes differs significantly across Europe. In northern Europe a majority of warm spells are connected to blocking, while cold spells are suppressed during blocked conditions. In southern Europe the opposite picture arises with most cold spells occurring during blocking and warm spells suppressed. Building on earlier work by Brunner et al. (2017) this study aims at a better understanding of the connection between blocking and temperature extremes in Europe. We investigate cold and warm spells with and without blocking in observations from the European daily high-resolution gridded dataset (E-OBS) from 1979 to 2015. We use an objective extreme index (Russo et al. 2015) to identify and compare cold and warm spells across Europe. Our work is lead by the main question: Are cold/warm spells coinciding with blocking different from cold/warm spells during unblocked conditions in regard to duration, extend, or amplitude? Here we present our research question and the study setup, and show first results of our analysis on European temperature extremes. Brunner, L., G. Hegerl, and A.

Spiders were collected from on the ground and under the stones and grasses by bottle, aspirator, Pitfall trap and pans and from branches, leaves and trunks of different trees and bushes by Steiner and Baggiolini method and insect net. They transferred to the laboratory and classified in 52 species and 51 genera belonged to 20 families. Thirty species, 13 genera and 2 families are reported for the first time from Iran, as follows: Family Agelenidae: cirrhotic liver cells in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma can hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells has been investigated in many studies, but, to the best of our knowledge, there are no data on DNA analysis of cirrhotic parenchyma around the HCC. In this study, cell kinetics and ploidy of parenchymal cells around HCC were performed to ascertain if this would predict the possibility of recurrence in the cirrhotic areas. The DNA content of 93 cases of HCC and of cirrhotic liver around the tumor nodules was analyzed by flow cytometry. Ploidy and proliferative index of HCC and cirrhotic liver were compared with macroscopic, histologic, and clinical features of each case and linked with the behavior of these tumors. Survival curves were assessed according to the Kaplan-Meier method. A multivariate analysis based on Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed on cases of diploid cirrhosis cells in which the S-phase fraction was evaluable. The univariate analysis of survival suggested significant roles for age, number of intrahepatic nodules, Edmondson-Steiner's classification, portal invasion, vascular invasion, presence of necrosis, hepatitis B surface antigen, alpha-feto-protein, Child's score, ploidy, and S-phase fraction of HCC cells. The DNA analysis of the cirrhotic cells showed that polyploidy was dramatically reduced in patients with HCC, compared with normal hepatocytes, and aneuploid clones were present among diploid cells. High S-phase fraction of cirrhotic cells and Child-Pugh classification were the strongest independent parameters affecting the tumor behavior in this study. The results of this study suggest that S-phase fraction of cirrhotic liver parenchyma may be employed as a new parameter in the prognostic evaluation of HCC Anthroposophic medicine offers a variety of treatments, among others the oil-dispersion bath, developed in the 1930s by Werner Junge. Based on the phenomenon that oil and water do not mix and on recommendations of Rudolf Steiner, Junge developed a vortex mechanism which churns water and essential oils into a fine mist. The oil-covered droplets empty into a tub, where the patient immerses for 15-30 minutes. We review the current literature on oil-dispersion baths. The following databases were searched: Medline, Pubmed, Embase, AMED and terms were 'oil-dispersion bath' and 'oil bath', and their translations in German and French. An Internet search was also performed using Google Scholar, adding the search terms 'study' and 'case report' to the search terms above. Finally, we asked several experts for gray literature not listed in the above-mentioned databases. We included only articles which met the criterion of a clinical study or case report, and excluded theoretical contributions. Among several articles found in books, journals and other publications, we identified 1 prospective clinical study, 3 experimental studies (enrolling healthy individuals), 5 case reports, and 3 field-reports. In almost all cases, the studies described beneficial effects - although the methodological quality of most studies was weak. Main indications were internal/metabolic diseases and psychiatric/neurological disorders. Beyond the obvious beneficial effects of warm bathes on the subjective well-being, it remains to be clarified what the unique contribution of the distinct essential oils dispersed in the water can be. There is a lack of clinical studies exploring the efficacy of oil-dispersion baths. Such studies are recommended for the future. [Can commonly used profile planes be used to evaluate changes in lower lip position?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21299383) Buschang, Peter H; Fretty, Kimberly; Campbell, Phillip M 2011-07-01 To determine the validity of five profile planes commonly used to describe the horizontal changes of the lower lip during orthodontic treatment. Pretreatment and posttreatment cephalograms of 79 patients (12.4 \u00b1 2.8 years of age) were evaluated. Lower lip (labrale inferiorus) changes over time were measured measure of actual horizontal lip changes, the labrale inferiorus was measured relative to a stable reference plane registered on the sella and oriented on the SN-7\u00b0. The lower lip actually moved anteriorly 2.35 \u00b1 3.35 mm during orthodontic treatment; the five profile planes indicated that the lower lip moved to a more retrusive, posterior position. The five profile planes also showed no statistically significant sex differences in terms of the treatment changes that occurred, while the actual lip changes showed that males exhibited significantly greater changes than females. Actual treatment changes showed that the lower lip moved to a more protrusive position with nonextraction than with extraction treatments, changes that were not evident based on the five profile lines. While lip changes based on the five profile planes demonstrated moderately high to high intercorrelations ranging from 0.81 to 0.97, they showed only weak correlations (r < .35) with the actual horizontal changes of the labrale inferiorus. While all five planes measured similar aspects of positional change, none of them closely reflected the actual lower lip changes that occurred. These planes should not be used to measure changes in lip position that occur during treatment. [Increased expression of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin-homologous protein 2 correlated with poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17020969) Lian-Yue; Tao, Ou, Di-Peng; Wang, Wei; Chang, Zhi-Gang; Wu, Fan 2006-10-01 Because of its role in cell migration, the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) 2 has been implicated in cancer metastasis. Evidence to support such a role of WAVE2 in human cancer, however, is lacking. We thus examined the expression of WAVE2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues to test whether the levels of WAVE2 expression correlated to the progression of HCC. Samples of 112 HCC patients were determined immunohistochemically for WAVE2 expression and the correlation of WAVE2 levels with prognosis was analyzed. Among the 112 cases, 31 paired HCC and paracarcinomatous liver tissue specimens were analyzed for WAVE2 levels by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Among 112 cases of HCCs, the immunohistochemistry data indicated significant increase of WAVE2 expression levels in 71 cases. Importantly, the increased WAVE2 expression correlated with the multiple tumor nodules (P = 0.008), the absence of capsular formation (P = 0.035), Edmondson-Steiner grade (P = 0.009), vein invasion (P = 0.023), and a shortened median survival time (326 versus 512 days; P = 0.003). Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed the WAVE2 expression level was an independent factor for prognosis. The immunohistochemistry data were further confirmed by results of reverse transcription-PCR and Western analysis of 31 HCC cases, in which the WAVE2 mRNA and protein in HCC tissues were significantly elevated when compared with paracarcinomatous liver tissue (P < 0.001). WAVE2 expression is elevated in HCC tissues, which correlates with a poor prognosis, suggesting WAVE2 as a candidate prognostic marker of HCC. [The Influence of Class II Division 2 Malocclusions on the Harmony of the Human Face Profile.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29170363) Perovi, Tatjana 2017-11-24 BACKGROUND Persons with class II division 2 malocclusion are characterized by a very specific dento-skeletal and soft-tissue profile (a profile in which a protruding nose and chin, retruding lips, concave and shortened lower third of the face, and gummy smile are dominant), which is the opposite of the currently modern profiles (convex profile of protruding lips and small chin). The aim of this research was to determine the differences in parameters of harmonies of facial profiles between persons with class II division 2 malocclusions and class I, and to establish the significance of those differences. MATERIAL AND METHODS For this study, 50 patients with class II division 2 malocclusions and 50 patients with class I were selected; profile photos were recorded and a photometric analysis was done: a type of profile according to Schwarz, the shape of a nose, the prominence of chin, biometrical field, the position of lips in relation to the tangent Sn-Pg, S-line (Steiner), E-line (Riketts) and a facial angle according to Arnett. RESULTS The significant differences in profiles of persons with class II division 2 compared to class I were: position and prominence of the chin, the position of the lower and upper lip in relation to the S-line, and smaller value of a facial angle in relation to persons with class I. CONCLUSIONS The differences seen in skeletal profiles were not associated with significant differences in the profiled facial contours of the examined groups. The compensatory role of the fullness of soft tissues of the lips is probably the reason why there were not significant deviations in all the examined parameters. [Violence exposure and health related risk among African American adolescent female detainees: A strategy for reducing recidivism](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3045759) Woodson, Kamilah M.; Hives, Courtney; Sanders-Phillips, Kathy 2010-01-01 Juvenile crime and violent victimization continue to be significant social problems (Fitzpatrick, Piko, Wright, & LaGory, 2005); in that, adolescents, females in particular, are likely to participate in health related risk behaviors as result of having been victimized or exposed to a violent environment. Specifically, abuse, neglect, sexual molestation, poverty, and witnessing violence are well known risk factors for the development of trauma-related psychopathology and poor outcomes relative to delinquency, drug and alcohol abuse, and HIV risk behaviors (Steiner, Garcia, & Matthews, 1997). HIV infection is a common public health concern disproportionally affecting adolescent African American female detainees. This unique population has a serious history of violence exposure, which subsequently tends to lead to engaging in risky sexual behaviors, mental health problems, and abusing substances. Also, as a result of little to no intervention, this population is recidivating at an alarming rate, a problem that may further exacerbate the expression of health-related risk behaviors among African American adolescent female detainees. The authors briefly describe a pilot program to be implemented in the juvenile justice system that is based on the Model of Accumulated Risk (Garbarino, 1996), Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Model (1994), and the Positive Youth Justice Model (Butts, Bazemore, & Meroe, 2009). The program proposes to reduce risky sexual behaviors, teach alternatives to abusing substances, treat mental health concerns, and reduce the rate of recidivism through \"positive youth development\", PYD (Butts, Bazemore, Tying elements of wraparound services and reeducation together, this program addresses salient concerns that may have an impact on an adolescent detainees' success following their release from prison in a holistic manner.

It has been suggested that the ability of prohormones to self associate and form aggregates may be responsible for the sorting process at the trans-Golgi. To examine whether insulin oligomerization is required for proper sorting into regulated storage granules, we have constructed point mutations in human insulin B chain that have been previously shown to prevent formation of insulin hexamers (Brange, J., U. Ribel, J. F. Hansen, G. Dodson, M. T. Hansen, S. Havelund, S. G. Melberg, F. Norris, K. Norris, L. Snel, A. R. Sorensen, and H. O. Voight. 1988. Nature [Lond.]. 333:679-682). One mutant (B10His----Asp) allows formation of dimers but not hexamers and the other (B9Ser----Asp) prevents formation of both dimers and hexamers. The mutants were transfected into the mouse pituitary AtT-20 cells, and their ability to be sorted into regulated secretory granules was compared to wild-type insulin. We found that while B10His----Asp is sorted somewhat less efficiently than wild-type insulin as reported previously (Carroll, R. J., R. E. Hammer, S. J. Chan, H. H. Swift, A. H. Rubenstein, and D. F.

B9Ser----Asp is targeted to granules as efficiently as wild-type insulin. These results indicate that self association of proinsulin into hexamers is not required for its targeting to the regulated secretory pathway.

[PREFACE: International Conference on the Applications of the M\u00f6ssbauer Effect atmosphere, the high attendance in the sessions and the lively discussions made the conference a great success and a memorable event. It was pointed out, that M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy is still an interesting and powerful method with great opportunities in the future. Herbert M\u00fcller (Secretary) Michael Reissner (Chairman) This book is dedicated to our colleagues Nicol Malcom, who could not come, because he suddenly died a few weeks in advance to the conference and Hercilio Rechenberg, who died on his way home from Vienna.

This is the first observation of new proton-rich nuclei below Z=50 in over three years. A primary beam of 140-MeV/nucleon ^78Kr was produced using the Coupled Cyclotron Facility and fragmented in a Be target. The secondary neutron-deficient fragments were separated by the A1900 fragment separator [1] and stopped in a stack of silicon PIN diodes. The fragments were identified by a measurement of energy loss, total energy, and time-of-flight. ^60Ge is the last nucleus along the proton dripline lighter than cadmium which is predicted to be bound (S_2p = 50 \u00b1 240 keV) by the latest atomic mass evaluation [2] and which has not yet been observed. Theoretical calculations predict ^60Ge to be bound with respect to two-proton emission by 167(141) keV [3] and 630 keV [4], ^64Se not to be bound [2]. >From the number of observed events of ^60Ge and ^64Se the production cross section and lifetime will be estimated. No events of ^59Ga and ^63As were observed confirming that these nuclei are unbound with respect to proton emission and upper limits of the lifetime can be established. [1] D. J. Morrissey, B. M.

Tandem Repeats (TRs) constitute a large class of repetitive sequences that are originated via phenomena such as replication slippage and are characterized by close spatial contiguity. They play an important role in several molecular regulatory mechanisms, and also in several diseases (e.g. in the group of trinucleotide repeat disorders). While for TRs with a low or medium level of divergence the current methods are rather effective, the problem of detecting TRs with higher divergence (fuzzy TRs) is still open. The detection of fuzzy TRs is propaedeutic to enriching our view of their role in regulatory mechanisms and diseases. Fuzzy TRs are also important as tools to shed light on the evolutionary history of the genome, where higher divergence correlates with more remote duplication events. We have developed an algorithm (christened TRStalker) with the aim of detecting efficiently TRs that are hard to detect because of their inherent fuzziness, due to high levels of base substitutions, insertions and deletions. To attain this goal, we developed heuristics to solve a Steiner version of the problem for which the fuzziness is measured with respect to a motif string not necessarily present in the input string. This problem is akin to the 'generalized median string' that is known to be an NP-hard problem. Experiments with both synthetic and biological sequences demonstrate that our method performs better than current state of the art for fuzzy TRs and that the fuzzy TRs of the type we detect are indeed present in important biological sequences. TRStalker will be integrated in the web-based TRs Discovery Service (TReaDS) at bioalgo.iit.cnr.it. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. allostatic H.; Lee, Sung W. 2015-01-01 We propose to enliven educational practice by marrying a conception of education as guided human development, to an advanced scientific understanding of the brain known as allostasis (stability through change). The result is a groundwork for allostatic neuro-education (GANE). Education as development encompasses practices including the organic (homeschooling and related traditions), cognitive acquisition (emphasis on standards and testing), and the constructivist (aimed to support adaptive creativity for both learner and society). Allostasis views change to be the norm in biology, defines success in contexts of complex natural environments rather than controlled settings, and identifies the brain as the organ of central command. Allostatic neuro-education contrasts with education focused dominantly on testing, or neuroscience based on homeostasis (stability through constancy). The GANE perspective is to view learners in terms of their neurodevelopmental trajectories; its objective is to support authentic freedom, mediated by competent, integrated, and expansive executive functionality (concordant with the philosophy of freedom of Rudolf Steiner); and its strategy is to be attuned to rhythms in various forms (including those of autonomic arousal described in polyvagal theory) so as to enable experiential excitement for learning. The GANE presents a variety of testable hypotheses, and studies that explore prevention or mitigation of the effects of early life adversity or toxic stress on learning and development may be of particular importance. Case studies are presented illustrating use of allostatic neurotechnology by an adolescent male carrying diagnoses of Asperger's syndrome and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a grade school girl with reading difficulties. The GANE is intended as a re-visioning of education that may serve both learners and society to be better prepared for the accelerating changes of the 21st century. PMID:26347688 [FBI-1 promotes cell proliferation and enhances resistance to chemotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21713761) Fang, Feng; Yang, Lianyue; Tao, Yiming; Qin, Wei 2012-01-01 The so-called factor that binds to inducer of short transcripts-1 (FBI-1) purportedly plays an important role in tumorigenesis; however, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression level, clinical relevance, and biologic function of FBI-1 in HCC. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect expression levels of FBI-1 and to analyze its relation to clinicopathologic parameters and to the prognosis of patients with HCC. In addition, the biologic functions of FBI-1 in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and reaction to chemotherapy were detected by using HepG2 cells and SMMC-7721 cells; subsequently, the molecular mechanism of FBI-1 also was investigated. Finally, a xenograft mouse model was used to validate the observations obtained from in vitro studies. Expression levels of FBI-1 messenger RNA and protein were elevated significantly in HCC tissues compared with adjacent nontumorous liver tissues (ANLTs). Increased FBI-1 expression was correlated with multiple tumor nodes, Edmondson-Steiner grade, and a poor prognosis in patients with HCC (P < .05). In vitro studies revealed that FBI-1 was capable of promoting cell proliferation (but not cell migration) by regulating the cell cycle regulation proteins p53, p21, and p27. In addition, FBI-1 could inhibit cell death induced by 5-fluorouracil or doxorubicin through suppressing the activation of p53. Consistent with the in vitro data, FBI-1 was capable of promoting cell proliferation and enhancing chemotherapy resistance of HCC in vivo. The current findings indicated that FBI-1 plays an important role in HCC carcinogenesis and chemotherapy tolerance, and FBI-1 may served as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for HCC.

[Simulation of the West African Monsoon using the MIT Regional Climate Model](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013EGUGA..15.4099I) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Eltahir, Elfatih A. B. 2013-04-01 We test the performance of the MIT Regional Climate Model (MRCM) in simulating the West African Monsoon. MRCM introduces several improvements over Regional Climate Model version 3 (RegCM3) including coupling of Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) land surface scheme, a new albedo assignment method, a new convective cloud and rainfall auto-conversion scheme, and a modified boundary layer height and cloud scheme. Using MRCM, we carried out a series of experiments implementing two different land surface schemes (IBIS and BATS) and three convection schemes (Grell with the Fritsch-Chappell closure, standard Emanuel, and modified Emanuel that includes the new convective cloud scheme). Our analysis primarily focused on comparing the precipitation characteristics, surface energy balance and large scale circulations against various observations. We document a significant sensitivity of the West African monsoon simulation to the choices of the land surface and convection schemes. In spite of several deficiencies, the simulation with the combination of IBIS and modified Emanuel schemes shows the best performance reflected in a marked improvement of precipitation in terms of spatial distribution and monsoon features. In particular, the coupling of IBIS leads to representations of the surface energy balance and partitioning that are consistent with observations. Therefore, the major components of the surface energy budget (including radiation fluxes) in the IBIS simulations are in better agreement with observation than those from our BATS simulation, or from previous similar studies (e.g Steiner et al., 2009), both qualitatively and quantitatively. The IBIS simulations also reasonably reproduce the dynamical structure of vertically stratified behavior of the atmospheric circulation with three major components: westerly monsoon flow, African Easterly Jet (AEJ), and Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ). In addition, since the modified Emanuel scheme tends to reduce the precipitation [New relativistic effective interaction for finite nuclei, infinite nuclear matter, and neutron stars](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PhRvC..97d5806K) [NASA System Agrawal, B. K. 2018-04-01 We carry out the study of finite nuclei, infinite nuclear matter, and neutron star properties with the newly developed relativistic force, the Institute of Physics Bhubaneswar-I (IOPB-I). Using this force, we calculate the binding energies, charge radii, and neutron-skin thickness for some selected nuclei. From the ground-state properties of superheavy nuclei (Z =120 ), it is noticed that considerable shell gaps appear at neutron numbers N =172 , 184, and 198, manifesting the magicity at these numbers. The low-density behavior of the equation of state for pure neutron matter is compatible with other microscopic models. Along with the nuclear symmetry energy, its slope and curvature parameters at the saturation density are consistent with those extracted from various experimental data. We calculate the neutron star properties with the equation of state composed of nucleons and leptons in -equilibrium, which are in good agreement with the x-ray observations by Steiner [Astrophys.

Lett. 852, L25 (2018), 10.3847/2041-8213/aaa401] have set a limit for the maximum mass that can be supported against gravity by a nonrotating neutron star in the range 2.01 \u00b10.04 M (M)2.16 \u00b10.03 . We find that the maximum mass of the neutron star for the IOPB-I parametrization is 2.15 M . The radius and tidal deformability of a canonical neutron star of mass 1.4 M are 13.2 km and 3.9 \u00d71036g cm2s2 , respectively. [High-quality two-nucleon potentials up to fifth the chiral Y. NN potentials through five orders of chiral effective field theory ranging from leading order (LO) to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N4LO ). The construction may be perceived as consistent in the sense that the same power counting scheme as well as the same cutoff procedures are applied in all orders. Moreover, the long-range parts of these potentials are fixed by the very accurate N low-energy constants (LECs) as determined in the Roy-Steiner equations analysis by Hoferichter, Ruiz de Elvira, and coworkers. In fact, the uncertainties of these LECs are so small that a variation within the errors leads to effects that are essentially negligible, reducing the error budget of predictions considerably. The NN potentials are fit to the world NN data below the pion-production threshold of the year 2016. The potential of the highest order (N4LO ) reproduces the world NN data with the outstanding 2/datum of 1.15, which is the highest precision ever accomplished for any chiral NN potential to date. The NN potentials presented may serve as a solid basis for systematic ab initio calculations of nuclear structure and reactions that allow for a comprehensive error analysis. In particular, the consistent order by order development of the potentials will make possible a reliable determination of the truncation error at each order. Our family of potentials is nonlocal and, generally, of soft character. This feature is reflected in the fact that the predictions for the triton binding energy (from two-body forces only) converges to about 8.1 MeV at the highest orders. This leaves room for three-nucleon-force contributions of moderate size. [The nucleon as a test case to calculate vector-isovector form factors at low energies](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018EPJA...54....1L) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Leupold, Stefan 2018-01-01 Extending a recent suggestion for hyperon form factors to the nucleon case, dispersion theory is used to relate the low-energy vector-isovector form factors of the nucleon to the pion vector form factor. The additionally required input, i.e. the pion-nucleon scattering amplitudes are determined from relativistic next-to-leading-order including the nucleons the baryons. Two methods to include pion rescattering are compared: a) solving the Muskhelishvili-Omn\u00e8s (MO) equation and b) using an N/D approach. It turns out that the results differ strongly from each other. Furthermore the results are compared to a fully dispersive calculation of the (subthreshold) pion-nucleon amplitudes based on Roy-Steiner (RS) equations. In full agreement with the findings from the hyperon sector it turns out that the inclusion of Delta baryons is not an option but a necessity to obtain reasonable results. The magnetic isovector form factor depends strongly on a low-energy constant of the NLO Lagrangian. If it is adjusted such that the corresponding magnetic radius is reproduced, then the results for the corresponding pion-nucleon scattering amplitude (based on the MO equation) agree very well with the RS results. Also in the electric sector the Delta degrees of freedom are needed to obtain the correct order of magnitude for the isovector charge and the corresponding electric radius. Yet quantitative agreement is not achieved. If the subtraction constant that appears in the solution of the MO equation is not taken from nucleon+Delta chiral perturbation theory but adjusted such that the electric radius is reproduced, then one obtains also in this sector a pion-nucleon scattering amplitude that agrees well with the RS results. [Characterizing the degree of convective clustering using radar reflectivity and its application to evaluating model simulations](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFM.A13E2127C) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Cheng, W. Y.; Kim, D.; Rowe, A.; Park, S. 2017-12-01 Despite the impact of mesoscale convective organization on the properties of convection (e.g., mixing between updrafts and environment), parameterizing the degree of convective organization has only recently been attempted in cumulus parameterization schemes (e.g., Unified Convection Scheme UNICON). Additionally, challenges remain in determining the degree of convective organization from observations and in comparing directly with the organization metrics in model simulations. This study addresses the need to objectively quantify the degree of mesoscale convective organization using high quality S-PolKa radar data from the DYNAMO field campaign. One of the most noticeable aspects of mesoscale convective organization in radar data is the degree of convective clustering, which can be characterized by the number and size distribution of convective echoes and the distance between them. We propose a method of defining contiguous convective echoes (CCEs) using precipitating convective echoes identified by a rain type classification algorithm. Two classification algorithms, Steiner et al. (1995) and Powell et al. (2016), are tested and evaluated against high-resolution WRF simulations to determine which method better represents the degree of convective clustering. Our results suggest that the CCEs based on Powell et al.'s algorithm better represent the dynamical properties of the convective updrafts and thus provide the basis of a metric for convective organization. Furthermore, through a comparison with the observational data, the WRF simulations driven by the DYNAMO large-scale forcing, similarly applied to UNICON Single Column Model simulations, will allow us to evaluate the ability of both WRF and UNICON to simulate convective clustering. This evaluation is based on the physical processes that are explicitly represented in WRF and UNICON, including the mechanisms leading to convective clustering, and the feedback to the convective properties. [Upper Permian magnetic stratigraphy of the lower a magnetostratigraphic and geochronological study of late Permian sediments in the Karoo Basin of the Western Cape Province, South Africa. A continuous, ~700 m thick section of deltaic sediments of the upper Waterford Formation (uppermost Ecca Group) and the fluvial sediments of the Abrahamskraal Formation (lowermost Beaufort Group) were sampled at the meter scale. U-Pb dating of zircons from interbedded volcanic ash beds by ion microprobe (SHRIMP) provided absolute age constraints on the age of the sedimentary rocks. Paleomagnetic analysis reveals a partial overprint of the Natural Remanent Magnetization (NRM) that is tentatively ascribed to the emplacement of the Karoo Large Igneous Province in the Western Cape region during the middle Jurassic. A stable component of the NRM was found at temperatures higher than 450 \u00b0C and was interpreted as a Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM) acquired during deposition, supported by a positive reversals test for this dual polarity ChRM. The virtual geomagnetic pole position for the Waterford and Abrahamskraal Formations computed from the average ChRM direction is in general agreement with the late Permian directions for stable Gondwana. A significantly different average inclination, and thus paleomagnetic pole position, is obtained by correcting the inclination shallowing error by the Elongation-Inclination method (Tauxe and Kent, 2004). The presence of both normal and reversed polarity zones indicate deposition after the end of the Kiaman Superchron, moreover the polarity sequence is in good agreement with the Illawarra sequence of Steiner (2006). Our results indicate a Capitanian (late Guadalupian) age for the Abrahamskraal Fm., in agreement with the Late Permian age, based on presence of Glossopteris flora and Dicynodont fauna, traditionally assigned to the fluvial-lacustrine sediments of the Beaufort Group. However, the U-Pb zircon ages of ca. 264-268 Ma suggest an age of 269 Ma for the top of the [Consistent, high-quality two-nucleon potentials up to fifth order of the expansion](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018JPhCS.966a2011M) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Machleidt, R. 2018-02-01 We present N N potentials through five orders of chiral effective field theory ranging from leading order (LO) to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N4LO).

[Cephalometric Evaluation of Children with Allergic Rhinitis and Mouth Breathing.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26421783) Helena Josep 2015-01-01 Orthodontists frequently treat children with mouth breathing. The purpose of the present study was to examine dental positions, skeletal effects and the pharyngeal airway space of children with chronic allergic rhinitis, when compared with a control group exhibiting a normal breathing pattern. Seventy Caucasian children from Santa Maria University Hospital - North Lisbon Hospital Center were evaluated, between September 2009 and February 2013. The study group comprised of 35 children with chronic allergic rhinitis, both genders, aged 5 - 14, with positive reaction to allergens, mouth breathing and malocclusion. The control group was composed of 35 children, both genders, displaying normal nasal breathing and malocclusion, who resorted to the orthodontic department. Measures of Ricketts, Steiner and McNamara's analysis were used and the t- Student test was applied to the data obtained. Statistically significant differences were observed between the oral and nasal breathers, respectively: lower facial height (49.1/45.9 mm), (30.1/26.9\u00ba) overjet (4/4.7 mm). Comparison between the allergic rhinitis and control group showed that there is an increased lower facial height, larger Frankfurt \u00e2 mandibular plane angle and Sela-Nasion oclusal plane angle in children with chronic allergic rhinitis. This group also had a shorter maxillary and mandibular length, less overbite and decreased upper airway space. Children with allergic rhinitis and mouth breathing have longer faces, shorter maxillas and mandibles and a narrowed pharyngeal airway space. No statistical differences between the groups in sagital relationships or in dental inclinations were found. [Mapping low- and high-density clouds in astrophysical nebulae by imaging forbidden line A. S. 2009-06-01 Emission line ratios have been essential for determining physical parameters such as gas temperature and density in astrophysical gaseous nebulae. With the advent of panoramic spectroscopic devices, images of regions with emission lines related to these physical parameters can, in principle, also be produced. We show that, with observations from modern instruments, it is possible to transform images taken from density-sensitive forbidden lines into images of emission from high- and low-density clouds by applying a transformation matrix. In order to achieve this, images of the pairs of density-sensitive lines as well as the adjacent continuum have to be observed and combined. We have computed the critical densities for a series of pairs of lines in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet and X-rays bands, and calculated the pair line intensity ratios in the high- and low-density limit using a four- and five-level atom approximation. In order to illustrate the method, we applied it to Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) Integral Field Unit (GMOS-IFU) data of two galactic nuclei. We conclude that this method provides new information of astrophysical interest, especially for mapping low- and high-density clouds; for this reason, we call it `the ld/hd imaging method'.

Anthroposophic therapy includes special medicinal products, artistic therapies, eurythmy movement exercises, and special physical therapies. The Anthroposophic Medicine Outcomes Study (AMOS) was a prospective observational multicenter study of 1631 outpatients starting anthroposophic therapy for anxiety disorders, asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, low back pain, migraine, and other chronic indications under routine conditions in Germany. AMOS incorporated two features proposed for the evaluation of integrative therapy systems: (1) a sequential approach, starting with the whole therapy system (use, safety, outcomes, perceived benefit), addressing comparative effectiveness and proceeding to the major system components (physician counseling, anthroposophic medicinal products, art therapy, eurythmy therapy, rhythmical massage therapy) and (2) a mix of different research methods to build an information synthesis, including pre-post analyses, prospective comparative analyses, economic analyses, and safety analyses of individual patient data. AMOS fostered two methodological innovations for the analysis of single-arm therapy studies (combined bias suppression, systematic outcome comparison with corresponding cohorts in other studies) and the first depression cost analysis worldwide comparing primary care patients treated for depression vs depressed patients treated for another disorder vs nondepressed patients. A total of 21 peer-reviewed publications from AMOS have resulted. This article provides an overview of the main research questions, methods, and findings from these publications: anthroposophic treatment was safe and was associated with clinically relevant improvements in symptoms and quality of life without cost increase; improvements were found in all age, diagnosis, and therapy modality groups and were [A groundwork for allostatic Tegeler, Charles H; Lee, Sung W 2015-01-01 We propose to enliven educational practice by marrying a conception of education as guided human development, to an advanced scientific understanding of the brain known as allostasis (stability through change).

[The oil-dispersion bath in anthroposophic Background Anthroposophic medicine offers a variety of treatments, among others the oil-dispersion bath, developed in the 1930s by Werner Junge. Based on the phenomenon that oil and water do not mix and on recommendations of Rudolf Steiner, Junge developed a vortex mechanism which churns water and essential oils into a fine mist. The oil-covered droplets empty into a tub, where the patient immerses for 15-30 minutes. We review the current literature on oil-dispersion baths. Methods The following databases were searched: Medline, Pubmed, Embase, AMED and terms were 'oil-dispersion bath' and 'oil bath', and their translations in German and French. An Internet search was also performed using Google Scholar, adding the search terms 'study' and 'case report' to the search terms above. Finally, we asked several experts for gray literature not listed in the above-mentioned databases. We included only articles which met the criterion of a clinical study or case report, and excluded theoretical contributions. Results Among several articles found in books, journals and other publications, we identified 1 prospective clinical study, 3 experimental studies (enrolling healthy individuals), 5 case reports, and 3 field-reports. In almost all cases, the studies described beneficial effects - although the methodological quality of most studies was weak. Main indications were internal/metabolic diseases and psychiatric/neurological disorders. Conclusion Beyond the obvious beneficial effects of warm bathes on the subjective well-being, it remains to be clarified what the unique contribution of the distinct essential oils dispersed in the water can be. There is a lack of clinical studies exploring the efficacy of oil-dispersion baths. Such studies are recommended for the future. PMID:19055811 [Overview of the Publications From the Anthroposophic Medicine Outcomes Study (AMOS): A Whole a physician-provided complementary therapy system that was founded by Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman. Anthroposophic therapy includes special medicinal products, artistic therapies, eurythmy movement exercises, and special physical therapies. The Anthroposophic Medicine Outcomes Study (AMOS) was a prospective observational multicenter study of 1631 outpatients starting anthroposophic therapy for anxiety disorders, asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, low back pain, migraine, and other chronic indications under routine conditions in Germany. AMOS INCORPORATED TWO FEATURES PROPOSED FOR THE EVALUATION OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPY SYSTEMS: (1) a sequential approach, starting with the whole therapy system (use, safety, outcomes, perceived benefit), addressing comparative effectiveness and proceeding to the major system components (physician counseling, anthroposophic medicinal products, art therapy, eurythmy therapy, rhythmical massage therapy) and (2) a mix of different research methods to build an information synthesis, including pre-post analyses, prospective comparative analyses, economic analyses, and safety analyses of individual patient data. AMOS fostered two methodological innovations for the analysis of single-arm therapy studies (combined bias suppression, systematic outcome comparison with corresponding cohorts in other studies) and the first depression cost analysis worldwide comparing primary care patients treated for depression vs depressed patients treated for another disorder vs nondepressed patients. A total of 21 peer-reviewed publications from AMOS have resulted. This article provides an overview of the main research questions, methods, and findings from these publications: anthroposophic treatment was safe and was associated with clinically relevant improvements in symptoms and quality of life without cost increase; improvements were found in all age, diagnosis, and therapy modality groups and were [Hazard assessment of exhaust emissions - The next generation of fast and reliable tools for in vitro screening](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFM.A24B..07R) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Rothen-Rutishauser, B. 2017-12-01 Hazard assessment of exhaust emissions - The next generation of fast and reliable tools for in vitro screening Barbara Rothen-Rutishauser Adolphe Merkle Institute, University of Fribourg, Switzerland; barbara.rothen@unifr.ch Pollution by vehicles is a major problem for the environment due to the various components in the exhaust gasses that are emitted into the atmosphere. A large number of epidemiological studies demonstrate the profound impact of vehicle emissions upon human health [1-3]. Such studies however, are unable to attribute a given subset of emissions to a certain adverse effect, which renders decision making difficult. Standardized protocols for exhaust toxicity assessment are lacking and it relies in many aspects on epidemiological and in vivo studies (animals), which are very time and cost-intensive and suffer from considerable ethical issues. An overview about the current state of research and clinical aspects in the field, as well as about the development of sophisticated in vitro approaches mimicking the inhalation of airborne particles / exhaust for the toxicological testing of engine emissions will be provided. Data will be presented that show that the combination of an air-liquid exposure system and 3D lung-cell culture model offers an adequate tool for fast and reliable investigations of complete exhaust toxicity as well as the effects of particulate fraction [4,5]. This approach yields important results for novel and improved emission technologies in the early stages of product development. [1] Donaldson et al. Part Fibre Toxicol 2005, 2: 10. [2] Ghio et al.

[Classification accuracy of brief parent report of development in Spanish-speaking toddlers.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21844403) Guiberson, Mark; Rodr\u00edguez, Barbara L; Dale, Philip S 2011-10-01 The purpose of the current study was to examine the concurrent validity and classification accuracy of 3 parent report measures of language development in Spanish-speaking toddlers. Forty-five Spanish-speaking parents and their 2-year-old children participated. Twenty-three children had expressive language delays (ELDs) as determined through multiple sources of information, and 22 had typical language development (TD). Parents completed the Spanish version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (Spanish ASQ; Squires, Potter, & Bricker, 1999) and the Thal, 1992; Jackson-Maldonado et al., 2003), which is the Spanish version of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories Words and Sentences form, and reported children's 3 longest utterances (M3L-W). Children were administered the Preschool Language Scale, Fourth Edition, Spanish Edition (SPLS-4; Zimmerman, Steiner, & Pond, 2002) at early childhood centers. All 3 parent report measures were significantly correlated with the SPLS-4, establishing their concurrent validity. Children with ELDs scored significantly lower than TD children on all 3 parent report measures. The Spanish ASQ demonstrated less than desirable levels of sensitivity and specificity; both the short-form INV-II and M3L-W measures demonstrated favorable sensitivity and specificity. Of these measures, M3L-W demonstrated the strongest classification accuracy qualities, including sensitivity, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. The short-form INV-II and M3L-W demonstrated highly satisfactory classification accuracy of ELDs, but M3L-W demonstrated slightly stronger accuracy. These results indicate that these measures may be useful in screening for ELDs in Spanish-speaking toddlers. [Semilocal two-nucleon potentials up to fifth order in the chiral expansion. We employ a simple regularization approach for the pion exchange contributions which i) maintains the long-range part of the interaction, ii) is implemented in momentum space and iii) can be straightforwardly applied to regularize many-body forces and current operators. We discuss in detail the two-nucleon contact interactions at fourth order and demonstrate that three terms out of fifteen used in previous calculations can be eliminated via suitably chosen unitary transformations. The removal of the redundant contact terms results in a drastic simplification of the fits to scattering data and leads to interactions which are much softer ( i.e., more perturbative) than our recent semilocal coordinate-space regularized Roy-Steiner equations to chiral perturbation theory, we perform a comprehensive analysis of nucleon-nucleon scattering and the deuteron properties up to fifth chiral order and study the impact of the leading F-wave two-nucleon contact interactions which appear at sixth order. The resulting chiral potentials at fifth order lead to an outstanding description of the proton-proton and neutron-proton scattering data from the self-consistent Granada-2013 database below the pion production threshold, which is significantly better than for any other chiral potential. For the first time, the chiral potentials match in precision and even outperform the available high-precision phenomenological potentials, while the number of adjustable parameters is, at the same time, reduced by about 40%. Last but not least, we perform a detailed error analysis and, in particular, quantify for the first time the statistical uncertainties of the fourth- and the considered sixth-order contact interactions. [Dispersal of the Japanese Pine Sawyer, Monochamus alternatus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), in Mainland China as Inferred from Molecular Data and Associations to Indices of Human Activity](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3585188) Fu, Da-ying; Haack, Robert A.; Zhang, Zhen; Chen, De-dao; Japanese pine sawyer, Monochamus alternatus Hope (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), is an important forest pest as well as the principal vector of the pinewood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer), in mainland China. Despite the economic importance of this insect-disease complex, only a few studies are available on the population genetic structure of M. alternatus and the relationship between its historic dispersal pattern and various human activities. The aim of the present study was to further explore aspects of human activity on the population genetic structure of M. alternatus in mainland China. The molecular data based on the combined mitochondrial cox1 and cox2 gene fragments from 140 individuals representing 14 Chinese populations yielded 54 haplotypes. Overall, a historical (natural) expansion that originated from China's eastern coast to the western interior was revealed by the haplotype network, as well as several recent, long-distant population exchanges. Correlation analysis suggested that regional economic status and proximity to marine ports significantly influenced the population genetic structure of M. alternatus as indicated by both the ratio of shared haplotypes and the haplotype diversity, however, the PWN distribution in China was significantly correlated with only the ratio of shared haplotypes. Our results suggested that the modern logistical network (i.e., the transportation system) in China is a key medium by which humans have brought about population exchange of M. alternatus in mainland China, likely through inadvertent movement of infested wood packaging material associated with trade, and that this genetic exchange was primarily from the economically well-developed east coast of China, westward, to the less-developed interior. In addition, this study demonstrated the existence of non-local M. alternatus in new PWN-infested localities in China, but not all sites with non-local M. alternatus were infested with PWN [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) 2011-10-01 The bi-annual Meeting of the Spanish Neutron Scattering Association, V RSETN, took place in Gij\u00f3n (Asturias), Spain, from 28-30 June 2010, at the Hotel Silken 'Ciudad Gij\u00f3n', close to the beautiful Cantabric seashore. It was the fifth in a series of successful scientific meetings, beginning in 2002 (Donostia - San Sebasti\u00e1n), and followed by conferences in: Puerto de la Cruz (Canary Islands, 2004), Jaca (Pyrenees, 2006) and Sant Feli\u00fa de Guixols (Costa Vicente Gotor, the University of Oviedo and Paz Fern\u00e1ndez Felgueroso, Mayor of the city of Gij\u00f3n chaired the opening ceremony. The conference covered a broad range of topics related to the use of neutron scattering techniques, from soft matter and biosciences to magnetism, condensed matter and materials applications. In addition to those topics, Spanish scientists working at neutron facilities talked about the recent upgrades of the neutron instruments. Colin Carlile (ESS, Lund), F J Bermejo (ESS, Bilbao) and Michael Steiner (Chairman of the European Neutron Scattering Association, ENSA) gave their personal views concerning the present and future perspectives of neutron scattering in Europe. They reviewed the situation of the running and new neutron facilities (European Spalation Source, ESS), the increase in the number of users and the spread of the scientific topics in which neutron scattering is used or where the impact of ESS will be most significant. Wonderful Plenary talks by Albert Furrer, Juan Manuel P\u00e9rez-Mato and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alonso opened the scientific sessions of this three-day meeting. The V RSETN was organized by the Department of Physics of The University of Oviedo in cooperation with the Spanish Society for Neutron Techniques (SETN, 'Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de T\u00e9cnicas Neutr\u00f3nicas'). The meeting attracted around 80 participants, including 13 invited talks, 23 oral presentations and more than 30 posters, both domestic and from abroad.

Here we studied several components of susceptibility to PWN infection in a model group of pine species widely distributed in Europe (Pinus pinaster Ait., P. pinea L., P. sylvestris L. and P. radiata D. Don), specifically concerning anatomical and chemical traits putatively related to nematode resistance, whole-plant nematode population after experimental inoculation, and several biochemical and physiological traits indicative of plant performance, damage and defensive responses 60 days post inoculation (dpi) in 3-year-old plants. Pinus pinaster was the most susceptible species to PWN colonization, with a 13-fold increase in nematode population size following inoculation, showing up to 35-fold more nematodes than the other species. Pinus pinea was the most resistant species, with an extremely reduced nematode population 60 dpi. Axial resin canals were significantly wider in P. pinaster than in the other species, which may have facilitated nematode dispersal through the stem and contributed to its high susceptibility; nevertheless, this trait does not seem to fully determinate the susceptible character of a species, as P. sylvestris showed similar nematode migration rates to P. pinaster but narrower axial resin canals. Nematode inoculation significantly affected stem water content and polyphenolic concentration, and leaf chlorophyll and lipid peroxidation in all species. In general, P. pinaster and P. sylvestris showed similar chemical responses after infection, whereas P. radiata, which co-exists with the PWN in its native range, showed some degree of tolerance to the nematode. This work provides evidence that the complex interactions between B. xylophilus and its hosts are species-specific, with P. pinaster showing a strong susceptibility to the pathogen, P. pinea being the most [TRMM Validation: Integration of TRMM Satellite and Ground-Validation Data to Determine Tropical Heating](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20010064884&hterms=heating+global&qs=Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall%26Ntk%3DAll%26N%3D0%26No%3D90%26Ntt%3Dheating%2Bglobal) [NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp) Houze, Robert A., Jr. 2001-01-01 Steiner and Houze showed from ground validation data that the Tropical Rain Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite Precipitation Radar's (PR's) twice daily only sampling should lead to an uncertainty of approximately 20% in rain estimates. They further showed that the uncertainties are smallest at the 5-7.5 km level. Schumacher and Houze used Kwajalein ground validation data to show that the TRMM PR misses only 2.3% of the near surface rainfall but does not see 46% of the area where rain occurs, because of the 17 dBZ PR reflectivity threshold. Houze discusses how the TRMM data extend earlier tropical convective studies to global coverage of the vertical profile of latent heating via the TRMM PR''s ability to distinguish and globally map convective and stratiform precipitation. Process studies carried out under this TRMM grant Yuter and Houze and Yuter et al. studied ship-based radar observations in the tropical eastern Pacific ITCZ. The eastern Pacific precipitation process is different from the western Pacific (the COARE area); rain is heavier but the clouds are not as deep. These process differences may affect the ability to remotely sense precipitation accurately in the two regions. Satellite microwave data were able to detect the precipitation as long as the rain areas exceeded 10 km in dimension. However, the microwave algorithms had difficulty distinguishing light and heavy rain. Satellite IR algorithms only partially detected the rain because the tops of the smaller and more short-lived rain clouds were sometimes not cold enough for the IR algorithms to detect them. Houze et al. focused on the west Pacific precipitating mesoscale convective systems and showed how their precipitation and internal dynamics vary in relation to the slowly varying large-scale heating-driven circulation, which has a structure described by a combination of Kelvin and Rossby wave response to the near-equatorial convective heating constituted by the mesoscale convective systems. Ship and [The intestinal microbiota composition and weight development in children: the KOALA Birth Study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25298274) W 2015-01-01 To investigate whether the intestinal microbiota composition in early infancy is associated with subsequent weight development in children. Analyses were conducted within the KOALA Birth Cohort Study (n = 2834). This cohort originates from two recruitments groups: pregnant women with a conventional lifestyle (no selection based on lifestyle) and pregnant women recruited through alternative channels (organic shops, anthroposophic clinicians/midwives, Steiner schools and relevant magazines). From 909 one-month-old infants, fecal samples were collected and analyzed by quantitative PCR targeting bifidobacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Lactobacilli and total bacteria counts. Between the ages of 1 and 10 years, parent-reported weight and height was collected at 7 time points. Age- and gender-standardized body mass index (BMI) z-scores were calculated. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equation. Colonization with B. fragilis group was borderline significantly associated with a higher BMI z-score of 0.15 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.02 to 0.31), in the conventional subcohort. After stratification for fiber intake (P(forinteraction) = 0.003), colonization with B. fragilis group was associated with a 0.34 higher BMI z-score among children with a low-fiber intake this subcohort (95% CI: 0.17-0.53). Higher counts among colonized children were positively associated with BMI z-score only in children within the conventional diet (BMI z-score 0.08; 95% z-score -0.05; 95% CI: -0.10 z-score -0.10; 95% CI: -0.17 to not associated with BMI z-scores, regardless of subcohort. Using a targeted approach, we conclude that the intestinal microbiota, particularly the B. fragilis group, is associated with childhood weight [Molecular evidence and clinical importance of -arrestins expression in patients with acromegaly.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29377493) Coelho, role in endocytosis and desensitization of somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2) and could be associated with the responsiveness to somatostatin receptor ligands (SRL) in patients with acromegaly. To investigate the in vivo correlation between -arrestins 1 and 2 with sst2, sst5 and dopamine receptor subtype 2 (D2) expressions, and the association of -arrestins with response to first-generation SRL and invasiveness in 1 and 2, sst2, sst5 and D2 mRNA expressions were evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR on tumoral tissue of 96 patients. Moreover, sst2 and sst5 protein expressions were also evaluated in 40 somatotropinomas by immunohistochemistry. Response to SRL, defined as GH <1 g/l and normal IGF-I levels, was assessed in 40 patients. The Knosp-Steiner criteria were used to define invasiveness. Median -arrestin 1, -arrestin 2, sst2, 9375; 731; 156; and 3989, respectively. There was a positive correlation between -arrestins 1 and 2 (R = 0.444, P < 0.001). However, no correlation between -arrestins and sst2, sst5 (mRNA and protein levels) or D2 was found. No association was found between -arrestins expression and SRL responsiveness or tumour invasiveness. Although previous data suggest a putative correlation between -arrestins and sst2, our data clearly indicated that no association existed between -arrestins and sst2, sst5 or D2 expression, nor with response to SRL or tumour invasiveness. Therefore, further studies are required to clarify whether -arrestins have a role in the response to treatment with SRL in acromegaly. \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

To bridge this gap, NSF- and ICDP-funded coring of Phase 1 of the CPCP finished in 12/2013 with the recovery of two major cores (1A, 518m and 2B, 253m; 31km apart) from opposites sides of Petrified Forest National Park spanning nearly the entire Triassic sequence (Chinle & Moenkopi fms) with many U-Pb datable levels (1,2,3) and a recoverable paleomagnetic polarity record (4). The cores will provide a U-Pb and paleomagnetic exportable time scale and sedimentary and geochemical proxies with undoubted superposition testing the motivating hypotheses of: 1) the accuracy of orbitally-paced cyclicity of the Newark APTS (5); 2) apparent climate trends as a function of drift through climate belts (6) and atmospheric CO2 (7); 3) the temporal link between the mid-Late Triassic biotic turnover and the ~100 km Manicouagan impact (1); and 4) the delayed ecological dominance of dinosaurs coupled to climate-driven provinciality (1,8). For orientation, the cores were drilled using a azimuth-tracking device, deviated 30\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 from vertical to the SE and S, and CT-scanned. The unprecedented sedimentological and stratigraphic detail visible in the CT-scans, and geophysical logs, plus the ~100% recovery promises successful tests of the motivating hypotheses and provide a superbly detailed reference section for this key episode in Earth system history. 1, Irmis+,2011, EPSL 309:258; 2, Steiner & Lucas, 2000, JGR B 105:25791; 5, Kent & Olsen, 1999, JGR 104(B6):12831-12841; 6, Kent and Tauxe, 2005, Science 307:240-244; 7, EPSL 323-324:27-39; +, 2014, PNAS 111:7958-7963. [Co-expression network with protein-protein interaction and transcription regulation in malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23274650) Yu, Fu-Dong; Yang, Shao-You; Li, Yuan-Yuan; Hu, Wei 2013-04-10 Malaria continues to be one of the most severe global infectious diseases, as a major threat to human health and economic development. Network-based biological analysis is a promising approach to uncover key genes and biological processes from a network viewpoint, which could not be recognized from individual gene-based signatures. We integrated gene co-expression profile with protein-protein interaction and transcriptional regulation information to construct a comprehensive gene co-expression network of Plasmodium falciparum. Based on this network, we identified 10 core modules by using ICE (Iterative Clique Enumeration) algorithm, which were essential for malaria parasite development in intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) stages. In each module, all genes were highly correlated probably due to co-regulation or formation of a protein complex. Some of these genes were recognized to be differentially coexpressed among three close-by IDC stages. The gene of prpf8 (PFD0265w) encoding pre-mRNA processing splicing factor 8 product was identified as DCGs (differentially co-expressed genes) among IDC stages, although this gene function was seldom reported in previous researches. Integrating the species-specific gene prediction and differential co-expression gene detection, we found some modules could perform species-specific functions according to some of genes in these modules were species-specific genes, like the module 10. Furthermore, in order to reveal the underlying mechanisms of the erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum, Steiner Tree algorithm was employed to identify the invasion subnetwork from our gene co-expression network. The subnetwork-based analysis indicated that some important Plasmodium parasite specific genes could corporate with each other and be co-regulated during the parasite invasion process, which including a head-to-head gene pair of PfRH2a (PF13_0198) and PfRH2b (MAL13P1.176). This study based on gene co-expression network could shed new [Analyzing the genes related to Alzheimer's disease via a network and pathway-based approach.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28446202) Hu, Yan-Shi; Xin, Juncai; Hu, Ying; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Ju 2017-04-27 Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains incomplete. Previous studies have revealed that genetic factors provide a significant contribution to the pathogenesis and development of AD. In the past years, numerous genes implicated in this disease have been identified via genetic association studies on candidate genes or at the genome-wide level. However, in many cases, the roles of these genes and their interactions in AD are still unclear. A comprehensive and systematic analysis focusing on the biological function and interactions of these genes in the context of AD will therefore provide valuable insights to understand the molecular features of the disease. In this study, we collected genes potentially associated with AD by screening publications on genetic association studies deposited in PubMed. The major biological themes linked with these genes were then revealed by function and biochemical pathway enrichment analysis, and the relation between the pathways was explored by pathway crosstalk analysis. Furthermore, the network features of these AD-related genes were analyzed in the context of human interactome and an AD-specific network was inferred using the Steiner minimal tree algorithm. We compiled 430 human genes reported to be associated with AD from 823 publications. Biological theme analysis indicated that the biological processes and biochemical pathways related to neurodevelopment, metabolism, cell growth and/or survival, and immunology were enriched in these genes. Pathway crosstalk analysis then revealed that the significantly enriched pathways could be grouped into three interlinked modules-neuronal and metabolic module, cell growth/survival and neuroendocrine pathway module, and immune response-related module-indicating an AD-specific immune-endocrine-neuronal regulatory network. Furthermore, an AD-specific protein network was inferred and novel genes potentially associated with AD were identified.

(Conference group IIB intron ribozyme of S. cerevesiae, require a high magnesium(II) concentration to show folding and function in vitro [1]. In contrast, in vivo conditions are characterized by a highly crowded cellular environment and much lower ion concentration. Molecular crowding agents are a widespread tool to mimic cellular crowding [2]. However, particular physical/chemical properties explaining the crowders influence are mostly not understood. In this study, we gain new insights on how polymer properties like viscosity, pore size etc. influence the activity and folding of a large RNA. We combined bulk activity assays and single-molecule F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer experiments, screening the PEG volume fraction (%) and molecular weight (MW). Our results revealed that upon the influence of crowding agents, a compaction of the underlying structure depends on the PEG % and the presence of different PEG MW and % unveiled an optimal pore size in terms of catalytic activity. In summary, an increasing density of the crowding environment shifts the RNA towards the most compact state, but the ribozyme is only active if the crowders network matches its size [4]. We interpret the most compact state as necessary, but not sufficient, to keep the ribozyme active.

Since these first studies, paleomagnetists have continued to explore what is now known as the Cretaceous Normal Superchron, an interval of prolonged normal polarity from 118 to 84 Ma. Paleomagnetic data from sediment cores from the DSDP Holes 369, 386, and 364, were interpreted as brief reverse intervals (Keating and Helsley, 1978, 1979). Relatively fewer studies have been reported for land-based sections of pelagic and platform limestones; reports include studies in northern and central Italy (Vandenberg et al., 1978; Tarduno et al., 1992; Tarduno, and Mexico (Urrutia-Fucugauchi, 1988; Benammi et al., 2006). We present here new magnetostratigraphic data for limestone sequences in central and southern Mexico from the Cretaceous Morelos and Tlayua Formations, which record short intervals of reversed polarity during the K normal superchron. The Morelos Formation has been revisited in Guerrero, southern Mexico, where the sequence of platform limestones with almost horizontal thick beds is well-exposed. The magnetostratigraphy shows dominant normal polarity for the sampled sections, with the occurrence of three short reverse polarity intervals corresponding to the Albian, which have been re-sampled and studied in additional detail for magnetic mineralogy and remanent acquisition. The Tlayua Formation is sampled in Tepeji de Rodriguez area, which is known for its rich and well-preserved fossil contents.

Control of I. scapularis is based on chemical treatment (Mather et al. 1987b; Schulze et al. 1987, 1991), environmental management (Wilson et al. 1988, Schulze et al. 1995), and habitat modification (Wilson 1986). These methods have shown variable success, and some potentially have negative environmental effects (Wilson and Deblinger 1993, Ginsberg 1994).Studies concerning natural predators, parasitoids, and pathogens of I. scapularis are rare. The use of ground-dwelling birds as tick predators has had only limited success (Duffy et al. 1992). Nymphal I. scapularis are often infected with the parasitic wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri (Howard) (Mather et al. 1987a, Hu et al. 1993, Stafford et al. 1996, Hu and Hyland 1997), but this wasp does not effectively control I. scapularis populations (Stafford et al. 1996). S. only to engorged female I. scapularis, and thus have limited applicability (Zhioua et al. 1995). In contrast, the entomogenous fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin is highly pathogenic to all stages of I. scapularis, unfed as well as engorged [Development and pathology of two undescribed species of predatory found in mass-reared Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot from two commercial sources during a routine examination of these predators for pathogens. Both microsporidian species were described from specimens that had been prepared for transmission electron microscopy; live specimens were unavailable for examination. One microsporidium, identified as Species A, was described from two specimens obtained from a commercial insectary in North America. All observed stages of this microsporidium were uninucleate. Rounded-to-ovoid schizonts appeared to develop in direct contact with the cytoplasm of lyrate organ cells (ovarian tissue). Mature spores of Species A were elongate-ovoid and measured 2.88 x 1.21 microm. A polar filament coiled 7 to 10 times in the posterior half of the spore. Sporoblasts and spores were observed in the cytoplasm of cells of numerous tissues and in developing eggs within gravid females. A second species, identified as Species B, was described from five specimens obtained from a commercial source in Israel. All observed stages of this microsporidium were uninucleate. Schizonts of Species B were observed within the cytoplasm of cecal wall cells and within the nuclei of lyrate organ cells. Mature spores were ovoid and measured 2.65 x 1.21 microm. A polar filament coiled 3 to 4 times in the posterior half of the spore. Densely packed ribosomes often concealed the polar filament and other internal spore characteristics. Spores were observed in the cytoplasm of cells of numerous tissues and occasionally within the nuclei of lyrate organ cells. Numerous spores and presporal stages were observed within the ovary and developing eggs. The development and pathology of Species A and B were compared to those of Microsporidium phytoseiuli Bj\u00f8ornson, Steiner and Keddie, a microsporidium previously described from P. persimilis obtained from a commercial source in Europe.

This system consists of a special developed quality control procedure and a combination of an interpolation and a downscaling technique. Whereas the so called VERA-QC is presented at this conference in the contribution titled \"VERA-QC, an approved Data Quality Control based on Self-Consistency\" by Andrea Steiner, this presentation will focus on the method and the characteristics of the VERA interpolation scheme which enables one to compute grid point values of a meteorological field based on irregularly distributed observations and topography related aprior knowledge. Over a complex topography meteorological fields are not smooth in general. The roughness which is induced by the topography can be explained physically. The knowledge about this behavior is used to define the so called Fingerprints (e.g. a thermal Fingerprint reproducing heating or cooling over mountainous terrain or a dynamical Fingerprint reproducing positive pressure perturbation on the windward side of a ridge) under idealized conditions. If the VERA algorithm recognizes patterns of one or more Fingerprints at a few observation points, the corresponding patterns are used to downscale the meteorological information in a greater surrounding. This technique allows to achieve an analysis with a resolution much higher than the one of the observational network. The interpolation of irregularly distributed stations to a regular grid (in space and time) is based on a variational principle applied to first and second order spatial and temporal derivatives. Mathematically, this can be formulated as a cost function that is equivalent to the penalty function of a thin plate smoothing spline. After the analysis field has been divided into the Fingerprint components and the unexplained part respectively, the requirement of a smooth distribution is applied to the [Linking atmospheric blocking to European temperature extremes in spring](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..1914603B) 2017-04-01 , especially in the last 15 years, indicating the influence of global warming. The change to a warmer environment holds the potential for even higher vulnerability to cold extremes, which can be triggered by blocking in late spring. Brunner, L., G. Hegerl, and A.

Input data rainfall-runoff model operational FEWS-NL Technical System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Huffman, G. J. 2013-12-01 Estimating errors inherent in fine time/space-scale satellite precipitation data sets is still an on-going problem and a key area of active research. Complicating features of these data sets include the intrinsic intermittency of the precipitation in space and time and the resulting highly skewed distribution of precipitation rates. Additional issues arise from the subsampling errors that satellites introduce, the errors due to retrieval algorithms, and the correlated error that retrieval and merger algorithms sometimes introduce. Several interesting approaches have been developed recently that appear to make progress on these long-standing issues. At the same time, the monthly averages over 2.5\u00b0x2.5\u00b0 grid boxes in the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) precipitation data set follow a very simple sampling-based error model (Huffman 1997) with coefficients that are set using coincident surface and GPCP SG data. This presentation outlines the unsolved problem of how to aggregate the fine-scale errors (discussed above) to an arbitrary time/space averaging volume for practical use in applications, reducing in the limit to simple Gaussian expressions at the monthly 2.5\u00b0x2.5\u00b0 scale. Scatter diagrams with different time/space averaging show that the relationship between the satellite and validation data improves due to the reduction in random error. One of the key, and highly non-linear, issues is that fine-scale estimates tend to have large numbers of cases with points near the axes on the scatter diagram (one of the values is exactly or nearly zero, while the other value is higher). Averaging 'pulls' the points away from the axes and towards the 1:1 line, which usually happens for higher precipitation rates before lower rates. Given this qualitative observation of how aggregation affects error, we observe that existing aggregation rules, such as the Steiner et al. (2003) power law, only depend on the aggregated precipitation rate [Status Report on the 40Ar/39Ar and U/Pb Dating of Tuffs in the Dewey Lake Formation of West Texas Towards Constraining the Permo-Triassic Magnetostratigraphic Time Scale](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFM.V23B1442C) Mundil, R. 2007-12-01 A detailed magnetic polarity time scale for the Permo-Triassic Boundary interval, critical for correlating events in marine and terrestrial paleoenvironments, is not yet well-established. Recently, late Permian magnetostratigraphic studies have been reported for non-marine sections in Europe and South Africa (Szurlies et al., 2003; Nawrocki, 2004; Ward et al., 2005). However, these sections are devoid of index fossil suitable for correlation with marine successions and also lack age constraints from radioisotopic dating methods. In other words, it is dubious to correlate these magnetostratigraphic data with the GSSP Permo-Triassic boundary and mass extinction. The Dewey Lake red beds formation of West Texas, believed to be the youngest Permian formation in North America, has yielded high-quality paleomagnetic data (Molina-Garza et al., 1989; Steiner, 2001) and contains several silicic tuffs potentially enabling high-resolution calibration of the magnetic polarity time scale in this critical age range. The tuffs have yet to be placed into a regional stratigraphic or magnetostratigraphic framework, and it is unclear exactly how many distinct eruptive units are represented by the 7 distinct samples collected to date from widely separated (>160 km) localities. 40Ar/39Ar (sanidine and biotite) and U/Pb (zircon) studies reveal that all 7 sampled tuffs were probably erupted within several hundred ka of the Permo-Triassic boundary as dated at the Meishan GSSP section (Renne et al., 1995; Mundil et al., 2004) but results thus far are inadequate to convincingly resolve age differences between the various samples. U/Pb dating of some samples is severely challenged by Pb-loss from the zircons despite application of the Mattinson (2005) annealing/chemical abrasion technique. 40Ar/39Ar data have been obtained from as many as four different irradiations in order to reduce neutron fluence related error. We observe the familiar ~1% bias between U/Pb and 40Ar/39Ar ages.

A. 2012-12-01 A 30\u00b0 gap was recognized in a composite APW path when global poles from predominantly igneous rocks were assembled in North American coordinates using plate reconstructions (Kent & Irving 2010 JGR). The 'monster shift' occurred between a 160-190 Ma cluster of mean poles at 75-80\u00b0N 90-110\u00b0E to a 140-145 Ma grouping centered at 60-65\u00b0N ~200\u00b0E. There are hardly any intermediate igneous poles whereas the rather divergent directions from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation published by Steiner & Helsley (1975 GSA Bulletin) are subject to adjustments for Colorado Plateau rotation and sedimentary inclination error, neither of which are precisely known for this redbed unit sampled in Colorado. On the other hand, similar large rapid swings have been recognized in the Late Jurassic APW path for Adria (Channell et al. 2010 Paleo3), suggesting a global phenomena. In an effort to fill the data gap between ~145 and 160 Ma, we sampled accessible outcrops/subcrops of kimberlites in the Timiskaming area of Ontario, Canada, that are associated with high precision U-Pb perovskite ages (Heamon & Kjarsgaard 2000 EPSL). We report initial results from two of the intrusions: the 153.6\u00b12.4 Ma Peddie kimberlite from outcrop and the Triple B kimberlite that was accessible by trenching and is assumed to be the same age as the nearby 153.7\u00b11.8 Ma Seed kimberlite as delineated by aeromagnetic surveys and borings. Systematic progressive thermal demagnetization indicated in each unit a dominant characteristic component with unblocking temperatures to 575\u00b0 that presumably reflect a magnetite carrier that will be checked by further rock magnetic experiments. Samples from the Peddie kimberlite had stable downward (normal polarity) magnetizations whose mean direction gives a paleopole at 73\u00b0N 184\u00b0E. In contrast, samples from the Triple B kimberlite have upward (reverse polarity) magnetizations with a well-grouped direction 197\u00b0E, proximal to the Peddie paleomagnetic results from NA Jurassic sedimentary rocks: Additional evidence for proposed Jurassic Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html) Housen, B. A. 2015-12-01 Kent and Irving, 2010; and Kent et al, 2015 propose a monster shift in the position of Jurassic (160 to 145 Ma) paleopoles for North America- defined by results from igneous rocks. This monster shift is likely an unrecognized true polar wander occurrence. Although subject to inclination error, results from sedimentary rocks from North America, if corrected for these effects, can be used to supplement the available data for this time period. Steiner (2003) reported results from 48 stratigraphic horizons sampled from the Callovian Summerville Fm, from NE New Mexico. A recalculated mean of these results yields a mean direction of D = 332, I = 39, n=48, k = 15, 95 = 5.4\u00b0. These data were analyzed for possible inclination error-although the dataset is small, the E-I results yielded a corrected I = 53. This yields a corrected paleopole for NA at ~165 Ma located at 67\u00b0 N and 168\u00b0 E.Paleomagnetic results from the Black Hills- Kilanowski (2002) for the Callovian Hulett Mbr of the Sundance Fm, and Gregiore (2001) the Oxfordian-Tithonian Morrison Fm (Gregiore, 2001) have previously been interpreted to represent Eocene-aged remagnetizations- due to the nearly exact coincidence between the in-situ pole positions of these Jurassic units with the Eocene pole for NA. Both of the tilt-corrected results for these units have high latitude poles (Sundance Fm: 79\u00b0 N, 146\u00b0 E; Morrison Fm: 89\u00b0 N, 165\u00b0 An E-I analysis of these data will be presented- using a provisional inclination error of 10\u00b0, corrected N, 266\u00b0 E). The Black Hills 165 Ma (Sundance Fm) and 145 Ma (Morrison Fm) poles, provisionally corrected for 10\u00b0 inclination error- occur fairly close to the NA APWP proposed by Kent et al, 2015- using an updated set of results from kimberlites- the agreement between the Sundance Fm and the Triple-B (158 Ma) pole would be nearly exact with a slightly lesser inclination error. The Summerville Fm- which is [First Report of the Carolina Spiral Nematode, Scutellonema brachyurus, from Soil of of the genus Scutellonema can cause substantial crop losses to ornamental and cultivated plants directly by feeding ectoparasitically on plant roots (Bridge et al., 2005; Coyne et al., 2006). In May 2015, a soil sample from a house garden from Heraklion city in Crete, Greece, was sent for diagnosis of plant-parasitic nematodes. In this place, there had been cactus (Opuntia sp.) plants (probably imported), which were uprooted 3 to 4 years earlier. After that, the area was cropped with cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) in spring-summer and leaf vegetables such as spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) in autumn-winter. The soil was collected 1 mon after the end of chicory crop. A population density (ca. 30 individuals/100 cm(3) of soil) of spiral nematodes (Scutellonema sp.) was found by extracting soil with the wet sieving and decanting method (Cobb, 1918). Morphological and molecular analyses of females identified the species as Scutellonema brachyurus (Steiner, 1938) Andr\u00e1ssy, 1958. The morphology of females was characterized by a hemispherical lip region with four to six annuli, morphometric data for 12 females were L, 640 to 760 m; a, 24.6 to 30.6; b, 5.8 to 7.4; c, 69.1 to 99.3; c\u00b4 0.5 to 0.6; stylet, 24.5 to 27.5 m with anterior part shorter than posterior; and spermatheca nonfunctional and male absent. The morphology agreed with the description of S. brachyurus (van den Berg et al., 2013). Alignment indicated that the D2-D3 and ITS sequences (KU059494 and KU059495, respectively) showed 99% and 100% to 99% similarity, respectively, to other sequences of S. brachyurus (type A) deposited in GenBank from the United States, Italy, and Korea (JX472037-JX472046, DQ328753, FJ485643; and JX472069, JX472070, JX472071, respectively), nucleotides. Phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian inference of these sequences placed the Scutellonema sp. in a highly supported (100%) clade that included all S. brachyurus [[The efficiency of oral contraception containing drospirenone in treating symptoms of premenstrual syndrome dysphoric disorder in gyneacology practice].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21374928) 2010-10-01 The efficiency of oral contraception drospirenone in treating symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) was demonstrated in a number of studies. The objective of this observation was to use the \"Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool\" (PSST) to identify women who suffer from severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or PMDD and evaluate the benefits of their treatment through using the oral contraceptive containing drospirenone in regime 24/4 in gyneacology practice. The retrospective study was conducted from September 2008 to August 2009. Fifty-one women met by the PSST (Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool, Steiner et. al., 2003) the criteria of severe PMS/PMDD. Twenty-eight women took no contraception at the start of the evaluation and twenty-three already took oral contraceptives before changing to the oral contraceptive with drospirenone. The women completed the PSST and in the case of severe PMS/PMDD started treatment with the oral contraceptive containing 20 microg ethinylestradiol /EE/ + 3 mg drospirenone /drsp/ in regime 24/4. The next evaluation was conducted by the same PSST after 3 or 4 months of treatment with this oral contraceptive. The study involved 51 women between the ages of 15 and 44 years (average 25.7 years), who completed the PSST before and after 3 or 4 months of treatment with the oral contraceptive containing drospirenone. The summary score of all subjects significantly decreased from 24.6 before they started using the oral contraceptive with drospirenone to 7,2 after 3 or 4 months of treatment with this oral contraceptive. Significant declines in summary scores have been shown in both groups (in the group without oral contraception from 24.9 at the start of the observation to 8.2 after 3 or 4 months of using this oral contraceptive with drospirenone; and from 24.3 to 6.0 in the group with the change from using various oral contraceptives to using the contraceptive containing drospirenone). The application of PSST for detection [New particle formation events as a source for cloud condensation nuclei in an urban environment](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014EGUGA..1615184W) [NASA Astrophysics events have been observed in many remote, urban and rural environments. The new particles can contribute significantly to cloud condensation nuclei concentrations, after growing into the appropriate size range (Kerminen et al., 2012). Several studies have attempted to quantify this contribution (e.g. Asmi et al., 2011, Matsui et al., 2013), but only a limited number of them to date have used simultaneous measurements of CCN concentrations and particle size distributions for this purpose (e.g. Levin et al., 2012). In this study, a data set from an urban background station, consisting of 22 months of size distribution and 12 months of CCN concentration measurements (Burkart et al., 2011, Burkart et al., 2012) with 10 months of overlapping measurements is combined to explore the variability of CCN concentrations, their possible causes, and the contribution of nucleation and growth events to CCN concentrations. Consistent with observations in many other locations, nucleation and growth events occur on 30% of all days in spring and summer, on 11% of days in fall and on 4% of days in winter. This suggests a potentially large source of CCN from nucleation and growth events, particularly in the warm season.

The combination of these techniques has led to the novel watt balance designs which are described. Finally I would like to thank: the editor of Metrologia and the editorial staff of IOP Publishing, the referees who have responded rapidly to requests and have kept the issue on schedule, and the authors who have taken the time to provide a range of papers showing the breadth of the work required to build and operate watt or joule balances.
