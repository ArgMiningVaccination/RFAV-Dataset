Trumpets sounded inside the medieval abbey and the congregation shouted \"God save the king!\" at a service attended by more than 2,000 guests, including world leaders, aristocrats and celebrities. Outside, thousands of troops, tens of thousands of spectators and a smattering of protesters converged. The crowed of well-wishers swelled to hundreds of thousands by the time the newly crowned Charles and Queen Camilla emerged to wave from the Buckingham Palace balcony alongside younger generations of royals. It was the culmination of a seven-decade journey for the king from heir to monarch. To the royal family and government, the occasion \u2014 code-named Operation Golden Orb \u2014 was a display of heritage, tradition and spectacle unmatched around the world. To the crowds gathered under rainy skies \u2014 thousands of whom had camped overnight \u2014 it was a chance to be part of a historic occasion. But to millions more, the day was greeted with a shrug, the awe and reverence the ceremony was designed to evoke largely gone. And to a few, it was reason to protest. Hundreds who want to see Britain become a republic gathered to holler \" Not my king.\" They see the monarchy as an institution that stands for privilege and inequality, in a country of deepening poverty and fraying social ties. A handful were arrested. As the day began, the abbey buzzed with excitement and was abloom with fragrant flowers and colorful hats as the congregation of international dignitaries, nobles and other notables arrived. Among them were U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, eight current and former British prime ministers, judges in wigs, soldiers with gleaming medals, and celebrities including Judi Dench, Emma Thompson and Lionel Richie. During the traditional Anglican service slightly tweaked for modern times, Charles, clad in crimson and cream robes, swore on a Bible that he is a \"true Protestant.\" But a preface was added to the coronation oath to say the Church of England \"will seek to foster an environment where people of all faiths and beliefs may live freely,\" and the epistle from the King James Bible was read by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Britain's first Hindu leader. A gospel choir performed a newly composed \"Alleluia,\" and, for the first time, female clergy took part in the ceremony. It was also the first to include representatives of the Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh faiths. In an ancient display of kingly power, Charles was anointed with oil from the Mount of Olives in the Holy Land \u2014 a part of the ceremony so sacred it was concealed behind screens \u2014 and presented with an orb, swords and scepters. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby then placed the solid gold crown, bedecked with more than 400 precious stones, on Charles' head, while he sat in the 700-year-old oak Coronation Chair \u2014 once gilded, now worn and etched with graffiti. Underneath the seat was a sacred slab known as the Stone of Scone, on which ancient Scottish kings were crowned. For 1,000 years and more, British monarchs have been crowned in such grandiose ceremonies that confirm their right to rule. Charles was the 40th sovereign to be enthroned in the abbey \u2014 and, at 74, the oldest. These days, the king no longer has executive or political power, and the service is purely ceremonial since Charles automatically became king upon death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in September. The king does remain the U.K.'s head of state and a symbol of national identity \u2014 and Charles will have to work to bring together a multicultural nation and shore up support for the monarchy at at time when it is waning, especially among younger people. Today's public is very different from the audience that saw Elizabeth crowned. Almost 20% of the population now comes from ethnic minority groups, compared with less than 1% in the 1950s, and less than half of the population describe themselves as Christian. The anti-monarchy group Republic said six of its members, including its chief executive, were arrested as they arrived at a protest. Police, who had warned they would have a \"low tolerance\" for people seeking to disrupt the day, said four people were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. The environmental group Just Stop Oil said more than a dozen of its members were also arrested. The detentions sparked criticism that police were clamping down on free speech, and Human Rights Watch said the arrests were \"something you would expect to see in Moscow, not London.\" The multimillion-pound cost of the all the pomp \u2014 the exact figure unknown \u2014 also rankled some amid a cost-of-living crisis that has meant many Britons are struggling to pay energy bills and buy food. Still, Charles has sought to lead a smaller, less expensive royal machine for the 21st century. His was a shorter affair than Elizabeth's three-hour coronation, with fewer guests and an abbreviated procession. The notoriously feuding royal family put on its own show of unity. Heir to the throne Prince William, his wife, Kate, and their three children were all in attendance. Towards the end of the ceremony, William knelt before his father and pledged loyalty to the king \u2014 before kissing him on the cheek. Then Welby invited everyone in the abbey to swear \"true allegiance\" to the monarch. He said people watching on television could pay homage, too \u2014 though that part of the ceremony was toned down after some criticized it as a tone-deaf effort to demand a public oath of allegiance for Charles. William's younger brother Prince Harry, who has publicly sparred with the family, arrived alone. His wife Meghan and their children remained at home in California, where the couple has lived since quitting as working royals in 2020. As Charles and the key royals joined a magnificent military procession after the ceremony, Harry stood waiting outside the abbey until a car arrived to drive him away. Large crowds cheered as Charles and Camilla rode in the Gold State Carriage from the Abbey to Buckingham Palace, accompanied by a procession of 4,000 troops and military bands playing jaunty tunes. As the king and queen waved to a sea of people outside the palace, the Royal Air Force aerobatic team, the Red Arrows, sped overhead, trailing red, white and blue plumes. \"It's just to be surrounded by love and to see our King Charles. He's our mainstay,\" said Jill Coughlin, a royal fan from Essex, east of London. \"We loved our queen and this is just further generations. So it's wonderful for us, absolutely wonderful.\" Queen Camilla's ex-husband [Andrew Parker Bowles](https://www.insider.com/camilla-ex-husband-andrew-parker-bowles-attended-coronation-queen-2023-5) attended her coronation and watched her crowned. The two divorced in 1995 amid drama and scandal between King Charles and Camilla. The former couple's grandsons were Queen Camilla's Pages of Honor in the ceremony. [King Charles, Queen Camilla](https://www.insider.com/king-charles-queen-camilla-buckingham-palace-balcony-coronation-2023-5), and the royal family officially greeted the public from a balcony at Buckingham Palace, waving and smiling after today's historic coronation. A photo shows the moment the King and Queen stepped outside to cheering crowds. Charles and Camilla both appeared joyful nearby to Prince William, Kate Middleton, and their children Prince George, 9, Charlotte, 8, and Louis, 5. Notably absent was Prince Harry. The past few years have been notably strained between Harry and the royals, making his [attendance at the coronation today](https://www.insider.com/prince-harry-reunites-royal-family-king-charles-coronation-photos-2023-5) \u2014 and his absence on the Buckingham Palace balcony \u2014 significant. [Queen Camilla](https://www.insider.com/hidden-details-camillas-coronation-robe-once-worn-by-queen-elizabeth-2023-4) was proclaimed queen with a crown that paid tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II at King Charles' coronation on Saturday. The [new queen](https://www.insider.com/queen-camilla-coronation-crown-tribute-elizabeth-ii-2023-5) had the crown adjusted with some personal touches to reflect her personal style as well as to pay tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth. The crown was reset with Cullinan III, IV, and V diamonds which belonged to Queen Elizabeth and were often worn by her as brooches, the press release added. Prince Louis attended King Charles III's coronation on Saturday. He appeared bored in photos from the ceremony, and even yawned in one. King Charles had a similar expression at Queen Elizabeth's coronation in 1953, when he was 4. Even before the ceremony started, Louis didn't seem too excited to be there, as shown by his expression when he entered the abbey with his sister, Princess Charlotte. It's not the first time Louis has made his thoughts about royal events clear: Last year, he made headlines when [he appeared to have a tantrum](https://www.insider.com/prince-louis-photos-tantrum-crying-jubilee-kate-middleton-2022-6) during Queen Elizabeth's Trooping the Colour. See the [Louis photos from the coronation](https://www.insider.com/prince-louis-bored-king-charles-coronation-photos-2023-5). From traditional robes to statement headpieces, royals and guests wore an array of colorful outfits for the coronation of Britain's King Charles III on Saturday, filling London's Westminster Abbey with a mix of hues and designs. The monarch arrived in the crimson velvet Robe of State, worn by his grandfather King George VI at his 1937 coronation, a crimson coronation tunic and cream silk overshirt with royal naval trousers. He changed into ceremonial regalia worn by his predecessors to be crowned: the gold-silk full-length Supertunica coat and the Coronation Sword Belt, and over that the gold cloth Imperial Mantle, originally made for the coronation of George IV in 1821 and the oldest vestment in the service. A white leather glove embroidered with gilt metal thread was placed onto his right hand. Charles was crowned with the historic St Edward's Crown that has been used since the coronation of King Charles II in 1661. Queen Camilla arrived in the Robe of State originally made for the late Queen Elizabeth in 1953 over an ivory gown embellished with silver and gold floral embroidery and designed by British couturier Bruce Oldfield. Both left the Abbey in purple Robes of Estate - Charles', previously worn by George VI and Camilla's designed by the Royal School of Needlework and featuring nature-themed embroidery. \"For the first time, insects including bees, butterflies, a beetle and caterpillar feature on the Coronation Robe, drawing on the themes of nature and the environment and reflecting Their Majesties' affection for the natural world,\" Buckingham Palace said. The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, wore formal robes and mantels over their outfits, with the heir to the throne in the ceremonial dress uniform of the Welsh Guards and his wife wearing a headpiece made of silver and crystal leaves instead of a tiara. Both she and her daughter Charlotte wore ivory silk crepe frocks adorned with embroidered rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock motifs - a nod to the United Kingdom's four nations, designed by Alexander McQueen, the same label Kate chose for her wedding dress in 2011. Charles' siblings also wore traditional robes, while his nieces - Princesses Beatrice, Eugenie, Zara and Lady Louise wore dresses or coats in fuchsia, blue and floral prints respectively. His son Prince Harry, no longer a working royal, wore morning dress. Among the celebrity guests were actress Emma Thompson in a red coat adorned with rose designs and U.S. singer Katy Perry, who will perform at the coronation concert in Windsor on Sunday, dressed in a fitted lilac short-sleeved skirt suit with matching opera gloves and statement hat. Veteran actresses Maggie Smith and Judi Dench, who has portrayed both Queen Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria on screen, chose different shades of blue. Singers Nick Cave and Lionel Ritchie, who will also perform at Sunday's concert, wore three-piece black suits, while actor Stephen Fry added a touch of color with a yellow waistcoat. There were traditional outfits from across the Commonwealth and peers wore red robes. Block colored outfits were also popular with U.S and French first ladies Jill Biden and Brigitte Macron dressed in powder blue and pale pink respectively while Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska chose a matching sage dress and coat. Colorful statement hats and fascinators in fuchsia, orange and red peppered the Abbey. Throughout his years in royal life, King Charles III has found moments of spontaneity and humor amid his duties. His face lit up while meeting a cow in Wales in 2013. That same year, he acquainted himself with a bald eagle. When a bumblebee flew into his suit while he held a tuatara in 2015, Charles took it in stride. See all the candid [King Charles photos](https://www.insider.com/king-charles-funny-candid-photos-2022-9) here. Police arrested the leader of the anti-monarchy group Republic hours before King Charles' coronation on Saturday, taken away from a few hundred protesters who had gathered among the crowds lining the procession route in central London. Republic had said it would mount the biggest protest against a British monarch in modern history. Protesters wore yellow t-shirts to stand out and held up signs saying \"Not My King.\" They spent most of the service booing or singing songs such as \"he is just a normal man.\" But London police had warned they would take action if protesters tried to \"obstruct the enjoyment and celebration\" of the day, and they formed a ring around the group. Republic said its leader Graham Smith had been detained on Saturday morning and a photo posted on Twitter showed him sitting on the ground surrounded by police officers. \"It is disgusting and massively over the top,\" said Kevin John, 57, a salesman from Devon who was among the protesters. \"It is also hugely counterproductive by the police because all it has done is create a massive amount of publicity for us. It is completely crazy.\" Police did not confirm Smith's arrest but said they had arrested four people on suspicion of causing a public nuisance and three people on suspicion of possessing articles to cause criminal damage in what they called a \"significant police operation.\" Republic said hundreds of its placards had been seized. Protests also took place in Glasgow in Scotland and Cardiff in Wales, with signs held up saying: \"Abolish the monarchy, feed the people.\" On social media, many contrasted the cost of living crisis in Britain with the pomp and pageantry on display at the coronation. Although the protesters were in a minority compared with the tens of thousands gathered on London's streets to support the king, polls suggest support for the monarchy is declining and is weakest among young people. With the crown passing from Queen Elizabeth to her less popular son, republican activists hope Charles will be the last British monarch to be crowned. \"It has a hereditary billionaire individual born into wealth and privilege who basically symbolizes the inequality of wealth and power in our society,\" said lawmaker Clive Lewis, who was among the anti-monarchy protesters. STAGGERINGLY EXPENSIVE In London, protesters demanded an elected head of state. They say that the royal family has no place in a modern constitutional democracy and is staggeringly expensive to maintain. Most of the anti-monarchy protesters on Saturday had congregated in Trafalgar Square next to the bronze statue of King Charles I, who was beheaded in 1649, leading to a short-lived republic. Some held up signs saying \"privatize them\" and \"abolish the monarchy, not the right to protest.\" Other signs featured a picture of Meghan, the wife of Charles' son Prince Harry, with the words \"the people's princess,\" and \"God Save the King\" with a picture of the late soccer great Pele. Since Charles became king last September, there have been protests at royal events. He was heckled at a Commonwealth Day event at Westminster Abbey in March and targeted with eggs in York in November. The death of the queen has also reignited debate in other parts of the world, such as Australia and Jamaica, about the need to retain Charles as their head of state. The state government of New South Wales said it had decided not to light up the sails of the Sydney Opera House to mark the coronation, in order to save money. While many other European monarchies have come and gone, or are far diminished in scale and importance, the British royal family has remained remarkably resilient. In Britain, polls show the majority of the population still want the royal family, but there is a long-term trend of declining support. A poll by YouGov last month found 64% of people in Britain said they had little or no interest in the coronation. Among those aged 18 to 24, the number voicing little or no interest rose to 75%. More than 11,000 police officers are on patrol for the coronation, the biggest ceremonial event staged in the British capital for 70 years. Kate arrived in a formal blue cape with an ivory dress under it. [Kate's dress](https://www.insider.com/kate-middleton-coronation-outfit-honored-princess-diana-queen-elizabeth-2023-5) was adorned with silver, floral embroidery that represented the four nations of the United Kingdom: roses for England; thistles for Scotland; shamrocks for Northern Ireland; and daffodils for Wales. Alexander McQueen is a go-to designer for the Princess of Wales. She wore a coatdress from the designer at Queen Elizabeth's funeral. The princess also wore pearl and diamond earrings that belonged to Princess Diana to the service, honoring her mother-in-law. Princess Diana was the last person to hold the title [Princess of Wales](https://www.insider.com/why-kate-middleton-has-princess-dianas-former-title-not-camilla-2022-9) before Kate. She also paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth with a necklace, as she wore the George VI Festoon Necklace, with three strands of diamonds. Prince William and Prince Harry were close as children, but they've grown apart in recent years. Harry said in his Netflix series that his step back from royal life caused a \"wedge\" between them. He said William screamed at him during the Sandringham Summit.

King Charles offered a brief smile as he entered Westminster Abbey ahead of his coronation ceremony, but his expression turned stoic as he walked inside. The king's face remained serious as he processed through the abbey. Prince Harry chatted animatedly with his cousin Princess Beatrice and her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, as he entered the abbey. Harry's ensemble also made him seem less formal than other royals in attendance, as he was reportedly asked to wear a morning suit.

His reign was formalized at his coronation on Saturday, which involved sacred traditions. After being anointed with holy oil and swearing his oath, Charles was officially crowned king. The official crowning of Charles started with the five phases. The first involved guests saluting him with the \"God Save the King!\" chant. Finally, Charles was crowned King of the United Kingdom with the St. Edward's Crown, the same crown Queen Elizabeth was crowned with 70 years ago. King Charles inherited Balmoral Castle and Sandringham Estate from Queen Elizabeth II. The Crown owns properties such as Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, and Kensington Palace. The properties range from quaint countryside estates such as Kew Palace to the gargantuan Buckingham Palace with its 775 rooms and priceless collections of furniture, artwork, and other artifacts.

Ahead of the historic service, Harry, 38, arrived at Westminster Abbey in London wearing a simple morning suit. [Photos of the Duke of Sussex](https://www.insider.com/prince-harry-king-charles-coronation-service-photos-morning-suit-2023-5) showed military medals pinned to his suit, however, in a nod to his military service. While some countries, including Greece and Bulgaria, abolished their monarchies [through public referendum](https://www.insider.com/countries-used-to-be-monarchies-abolished-history), royal commentator Marlene Koenig said the process is more complex than people think. \"It would take legislation, an act of Parliament, and signed by the Sovereign to end the monarchy,\" Koenig, a royal expert for History Extra, previously told Insider. However, Koenig added that \"the monarchy is not going anywhere anytime soon.\" Nonetheless, that's not to say things couldn't one day change if there were to be a greater call for Britain to consider the [future of the monarchy](https://www.insider.com/what-would-happen-to-royal-family-if-britain-abolished-monarchy-2020-3).

Prince Harry, 38, was pictured at [King Charles' coronation](https://www.insider.com/king-charles-coronation-schedule-guide-timeline-2023-5) ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London on Saturday morning. He traveled from California to attend a royal event solo, as Buckingham Palace previously told Insider in [an official statement](https://www.insider.com/prince-harry-attending-charles-coronation-without-meghan-markle-kids-palace-2023-4) that Meghan, 41, was remaining in the US with their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. Harry, who did not have an official role in the ceremony unlike his older brother Prince William, joined roughly 2,200 other guests who had been specially invited to attend the coronation inside Westminster Abbey. The ceremony marked the formal start of Charles' reign, who is now officially the oldest royal to become a monarch. Photographs of the Duke of Sussex showed him arriving at Westminster Abbey with his cousins, Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice, and their husbands Jack Brooksbank and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.

Michelle Fawcett, 52, a barrister, on watching King Charles and Queen Camilla pass in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach: \"It was a moment in history and pretty spectacular. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. No one else in the world does the pomp and ceremony like us.\" Mark Strasshine, from London: \"It's great to be able to get a glimpse even if it's a very, very busy event, a very wet, a very traditional British spring weather.\" On glimpsing Charles: \"It gives you a bit of confidence, it makes you feel the heart of the nation in you a little bit and stirs you a little bit inside. He looks ready for the day, it's obviously a big day for him.\" Ben Nash, 34, business manager from Cornwall: \"Charles has big shoes to fill but he's done well so far. The Royal family is part of our heritage, it's what we do well as a country.\" Andy Mitchell, 63, a teacher from Farnham, Surrey: \"When you see everyone dressed up and taking part it is just fantastic. It makes you so proud. It is just incredible to be of part of this,\" he said. \"My big concern is that younger people are losing interest in all of this and it won't be the same in the future.\" Louise Fellows, 50, from Worcestershire: \"We came to [Queen Elizabeth's] funeral and we had such an amazing time we thought we'd come again. And I love dressing up and I loved the monarchy and it's just such a fantastic atmosphere. It's so much fun. It's brilliant.\" Emily Jewell, 18: \"I think despite a lot of people's views, we should be going and seeing an important part of our history in the UK because it is quite meaningful and it's been a 1000-year tradition.\" Joy Davenport, 62, from Devon: \"This is a new era. I'm a green supporter and I'm very interested to see how he's going to encourage green issues.\" Anna Reynolds, 26, a teacher, from Twickenham, London on Charles: \"We don't love him, we don't hate him, there is just no great affection,\" she said. \"I think if we had a choice, we would just skip a generation.\" William Stevens, 5: \"I want to see him getting his crown.\" Sam Mindenhall, 27, cafe worker from Bristol: \"I think a lot of the issues that he [King Charles] cares about are quite important. I think he's trying to not democratize the monarchy but trying to do his best to sort of balance such a tradition with modern Britain and the modern world. \"He's just trying to be more inclusive and bring more people into our nation, like the whole thing about wanting to be a defender of the faith, but defender of all faiths.\" The coronation ceremony arrivals for King Charles III are currently underway.

Protests along the king's procession route were organized by anti-monarchy group Republic. Earlier this week, London police said they would have a \"low tolerance\" for any disruptions. Photographs appear to show protesters dressed in yellow and holding signs reading \"This country is ours\" and \"Not my king\" in the hours leading up to the coronation. More than 1,500 protesters planned to gather alongside well-wishers as Charles' coach travels through the streets of London. The coronation is \"a celebration of a corrupt institution. And it is a celebration of one man taking a job that he has not earned,\" chief executive of the anti-monarchist group Graham Smith said earlier this week. Since taking up his royal duties in September 2022, King Charles III has been busy setting the tone for his reign during several public engagements. His first 150 days or so have been eventful so far. Charles also gave his first address as monarch the day his mother died, during which he paid tribute to the Queen, gave Prince William a new title, and sent his love to Prince Harry. The following day, Charles was officially proclaimed king by the Privy Council at St James's Palace at the first meeting of an Accession Council to be broadcast live in history.

The pomp, pageantry and symbolism date back more than 1,000 years, but the crowning of this king will feature new twists on the tradition and changes from the coronation of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, 70 years ago. Plans for the ceremony at Westminster Abbey call for a more toned-down affair than the last one, even though royals from other nations, heads of state and most of Charles' family will be there, and the monarch plans to wear the same vestments as Elizabeth did. Here are some things to know about the coronation: WHY HAVE THE CORONATION IF CHARLES IS ALREADY KING? Charles automatically ascended to the throne when Elizabeth died Sept. 8, and he was officially proclaimed the United Kingdom's monarch two days later in an ascension ceremony broadcast for the first time on television. Charles said he was \"deeply aware of this great inheritance and of the duties and heavy responsibilities of sovereignty which have now passed to me.\" There is no legal requirement for a coronation, and other European monarchies have done away with the ceremonies. But the deeply religious and regalia-heavy event is a more formal confirmation of his role as head of state and titular head of the Church of England and was intended to show the king's authority was derived from God. During the service conducted by the church's spiritual leader, the archbishop of Canterbury, Charles will be anointed with oil, receive the traditional symbols of the monarch \u2014 including the orb and scepter \u2014 and have the St. Edwards Crown placed on his head for the first time. Charles' wife, Camilla, will be crowned as queen consort. WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST CORONATION? The coronation ceremony dates back to the medieval period, and much of it remains unchanged. Westminster Abbey has been the setting of the ritual since William the Conqueror was crowned in 1066. Elizabeth II's coronation in June 1953 was the first to be televised live. The broadcast in black and white drew an audience of tens of millions in the U.K. and was later played to a worldwide audience. In the age of streaming and social media, people will be able to watch Charles' crowning live \u2014 and in vivid reds, blues and golds \u2014 from virtually anywhere on the planet and post their hot takes with a crown emoji created for the occasion. Charles has said he plans to slim down the monarchy. His coronation is expected to reflect that with a ceremony shorter than his mother's three-hour extravaganza and no more than 2,800 guests in the audience \u2014 far fewer than the 8,000 who assembled to see Elizabeth crowned. In a nod to the change in the religious makeup of the United Kingdom, Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh religious leaders will play a role at the coronation. That reflects Charles' vow to be \"the defender of faiths,\" as opposed to the \"defender of the faith.\" The procession after the ceremony also will be decidedly shorter than the 5-mile (8 kilometer) route that Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, took around London in 1953. Charles and Camilla plan to take a more modern set of horse-drawn wheels for the 1.3-mile (2-kilometer) route from Buckingham Palace to the abbey. Once crowned, they will step back in time and retrace the journey in the 260-year-old carriage \u2014 notorious for its rough ride \u2014 used in every coronation since William IV's in 1831. WHO'S ON THE GUEST LIST? A hundred heads of state are expected to attend along with royalty ranging from Japan's Crown Prince Akishino and his wife, Kiko, to Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia. The U.S. will keep alive its streak of a president never attending a British royal coronation, although first lady Jill Biden is set to attend. William, Prince of Wales and heir to the throne, is expected to kneel before his father and pledge his loyalty in what's known as the Homage of Royal Blood. His younger brother, Prince Harry, the disgruntled Duke of Sussex, is not expected to take part in the service. His explosive memoir \"Spare,\" which became a bestseller early this year, made unflattering claims about the royal family. Until three weeks ago, there was a question of whether Harry and his wife, Meghan, would attend the crowning after leveling charges of racism and media manipulation at the royal family. While Harry will be there, the duchess is to remain at the couple's Southern California home with their two young children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. The coronation is just a few days before the first of Harry's lawsuits against the British tabloid press goes to trial. The case could reveal more family secrets. During a hearing in a similar case last week, Harry said in court papers that Buckingham Palace, with the approval of the queen, had an agreement with Rupert Murdoch's English newspapers to settle phone hacking allegations without a lawsuit. Harry said he was directed by palace staff to drop his litigation because his father wanted to curry favor with the press. The family drama doesn't end there. Charles' brother, Prince Andrew, is also not expected to play any role in the ceremony. Andrew gave up royal duties and was stripped of military titles and patronages after revelations of his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew settled a lawsuit with a woman who said she was forced to have sex with him when she was a teenager. WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CORONATION? With opinion polls showing support for the monarchy has weakened in recent years, this is the chance for Charles to seek and showcase the public's embrace. Crowds are expected to line the streets to cheer the new king, and throngs will stand outside Buckingham Palace waiting for him to appear on the balcony after the procession. While criticism of the crown was relatively muted in recent years out of respect for the queen and her decades of service to the country, there is likely to be much more discussion of whether the United Kingdom still needs this antiquated institution or if it should become a republic with an elected head of state. The leader of the anti-monarchist group Republic said it plans to have more than 1,000 protesters clad in yellow chanting, \"Not my king\" as the royal procession passes by. For the vast majority, though, it will be an opportunity to celebrate being British \u2014 or show their support for an institution that is the subject of fascination for so many around the world. Streets will be lined with union flags, spectators will dress in red, white and blue, and military jets will fly overhead streaming plumes of smoke in the national colors. The pomp and circumstance of the ceremony itself is also a reminder of a time when Britain was the most powerful nation in the world. WHO IS PICKING UP THE TAB FOR THE CELEBRATION? The public is footing the bill for the coronation. There is no official estimate yet of what it might cost. Some reports estimate it could top 100 million pounds ($125 million). A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said Tuesday that some estimates were \"more fanciful than others\" and that the true cost would be shared later. The celebration comes as the U.K. weathers a bruising cost-of-living crisis that left many struggling to heat their homes this winter and put food on their tables. But plenty of people stand to profit from the hoopla. Officials are expecting to see a tourism boost and there is no shortage of coronation-themed events and commemorative products that could ring up additional sales taxes. Fans looking to remember the historic event can find everything from fine china to souvenir coins or even cardboard masks of Charles and Camilla. Coronation themed biscuits, chocolates and beers are likely to be quickly forgotten. [King Charles](https://www.insider.com/international-royals-attending-king-charles-coronation-2023-4) will undoubtedly be monarch for a shorter period than his predecessor, Queen Elizabeth II, who [reigned for 70 years](https://www.insider.com/queen-elizabeth-ii-death-obituary-2022-9) before her death last year. At 74, Charles has limited time to carve out his legacy before [passing the throne to his son Prince William](https://www.insider.com/will-prince-william-become-king-2019-1). But royal experts agree Charles could still make a significant impact on the institution. They say if there's one thing the king should do during his reign to make a lasting impression, it's apologize for the monarchy's [racist past](https://www.insider.com/british-royal-family-racist-history-black-lives-matter-2020-8). The royal family has failed to fully acknowledge the monarchy's part in [Britain's slave trade](https://www.insider.com/king-charles-apologize-slavery-royal-family-monarchy-racism-2023-5), which involved the transportation and forced labor of African people in exchange for goods. Britain was responsible for transporting an estimated 3.1 million enslaved African people \u2014 only 2.7 million of whom are said to have survived the horrific \"middle passage\" \u2014 to its then-colonies in the Caribbean, North and South America, and other countries between the 16th century and 1807, when dealing in the slave trade became illegal across the British Empire. It took another three decades to outlaw the institution entirely in 1838. Former president Donald Trump blasted President Joe Biden for not attending [King Charles III's upcoming coronation](https://www.insider.com/king-charles-iii-coronation-england-british-monarchy-2023-5), despite the fact that no US president has ever attended one. [Trump](https://www.insider.com/biden-coronation-trump-presidents-history-2023-5) also appeared to reference Biden's age affecting his ability to travel, telling GB News, \"I don't think he can do it physically.\" While both the president and the first lady traveled to the UK to [attend Queen Elizabeth II's funeral in September](https://www.insider.com/president-biden-first-lady-jill-at-queen-funeral-photos-2022-9), only Jill Biden will attend the coronation on behalf of the United States, leading a delegation that has yet to be announced. According to a [White House readout](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/04/readout-of-president-joe-bidens-call-with-king-charles-iii-2/) of a phone call between Biden and Charles in April, the president \"congratulated the King on his upcoming Coronation\" and \"conveyed his desire to meet with the King in the United Kingdom at a future date.\" King Charles III lives in a palace, travels in a chauffeur-driven Bentley and is one of Britain's richest men, but he's similar to many of his subjects in one very basic way: His family life is complicated \u2014 very complicated. There's a second wife, an embarrassing brother, and an angry son and daughter-in-law, all with allies who aren't shy about whispering family secrets in the ears of friendly reporters. The new king will hope to keep a lid on those tensions when his royally blended family joins as many as 2,800 guests for Charles' coronation on May 6 at Westminster Abbey. All except Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, are attending. How Charles manages his family drama over the coming weeks and years is crucial to the king's efforts to preserve and protect the 1,000-year-old hereditary monarchy he now embodies. Without the respect of the public, the House of Windsor risks being lumped together with pop stars, social media influencers and reality TV contestants as fodder for the British tabloids, undermining the cachet that underpins its role in public life. Royal historian Hugo Vickers says people should look past the sensational headlines and focus on what Charles accomplishes now that he is king. \"In a sense, he sort of becomes a new man when he becomes king,\" said Vickers, author of \"Coronation: The Crowning of Elizabeth II.\" \"Look at him as he is now, look at him the way he is approaching everything, look at his positivity and look at how right he's been on so many issues,\" he added. \"Unfortunately, he had those difficult times with his marriages and some of the other issues, but we live in a very tricky era.\" The horror show came back to haunt Charles last week, when the king's estranged younger son, Prince Harry, dropped a new round of allegations Tuesday about the royal family into the middle of the coronation buildup. In written evidence for his invasion of privacy claim against a British newspaper, Harry claimed his father prevented him from filing the lawsuit a decade ago. The prince said Charles didn't want to dredge up graphic testimony about his extramarital affair with the former Camilla Parker-Bowles when he was married to the late Princess Diana. Diana was the mother of Harry and his elder brother and heir to the throne, William, the Prince of Wales. Camilla, now the queen consort, went on to marry Charles in 2005 and will be crowned alongside her husband at Westminster Abbey. If the past is any indication, attention will now shift to body language, seating plans and even wardrobe choices during the coronation, as royal watchers look for any signs of a thaw in the family tensions. But Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, doesn't expect Harry to have a lot of contact with the rest of his family. In any case, Harry won't be in the U.K. for long, so there's not much time for fence mending. \"The stuff that we discovered (Tuesday) is really not going to help his cause,\" Little said. \"But, you know, will there be time to go over all that with the king and the Prince of Wales? Unlikely.\" The royal soap opera didn't begin with the current generation of royals. After all, Edward VIII sparked a constitutional crisis in 1936 when he abdicated the throne to marry the twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson. Charles' grandfather, George VI, is credited with saving the monarchy with a life of low-key public service after he replaced his flamboyant elder brother. The late Queen Elizabeth II burnished the family's reputation during a 70-year reign, in which she became a symbol of stability who cheered the nation's victories and comforted it during darker times. But Charles grew up in a different era, under the glare of media attention as deference to the monarchy faded. He has been a controversial figure ever since the very public breakdown of his marriage to Diana, who was revered by many people for her looks and her compassion. Diana alleged that there had been \"three people\" in the marriage, pointing the finger at Charles' longtime love Camilla Parker-Bowles. Camilla, initially reviled by Diana's fans, has worked hard to rehabilitate her image. Her ex-husband and their children are expected to attend the coronation, with her grandsons serving as pages of honor. She supports a raft of causes, ranging from adult literacy to protecting the victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. But even that effort has sparked tensions. Harry claimed in his memoir \"Spare\" that the senior royals leaked unflattering stories about him to the news media in return for more favorable coverage, particularly to improve Camilla's image. At the time of their marriage in 2018, Harry and Meghan were celebrated as the new face of the monarchy. Meghan, a biracial American actress, brought a touch of Hollywood glamour to the royal family and many observers hoped she would help the Windsors connect with younger people in an increasingly multicultural nation. Those hopes quickly crumbled amid allegations that palace officials were insensitive to Meghan's mental health struggles as she adjusted to royal life. Harry and Meghan walked away from frontline royal duties three years ago and moved to California, from which they have lobbed repeated critiques at the House of Windsor. In a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey they hinted at racism in the palace, alleging that one unidentified member of the royal family had inquired about the color of their unborn son's skin before his birth. Harry, i n a Netflix series broadcast last year, said the episode was an example of unconscious bias and that the royal family needed to \"learn and grow\" so it could be \"part of the solution rather than part of the problem.\" The repeated attacks led to months of speculation about whether the couple would be invited to the coronation. The palace finally answered that question two weeks ago when it announced that Harry would attend but Meghan would remain in California with their two children. And then there is Charles' brother Prince Andrew, who became a toxic time bomb inside the royal family when the world learned about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the financier's long-time girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein, who was convicted of sex crimes in 2008, died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on a second set of charges. Maxwell was convicted last year of helping procure young girls for Epstein and is serving a 20-year sentence at a federal prison in Florida. Andrew gave up his royal duties in 2019 after a disastrous interview with the BBC in which he tried to explain away his links to Epstein and Maxwell. He was stripped of his honorary military titles and patronages as he prepared to defend a civil lawsuit filed by a woman who said she was forced to have sex with the prince when she was a teenager. Andrew denied the allegations but settled the suit last year before it came to trial. While terms of the agreement weren't released, The Sun newspaper reported that Charles and the late queen paid the bulk of the estimated 7 million pound ($8.7 million) settlement. \"I think it was inevitable that when Charles became king, a lot of the personal stuff would come back to haunt him, Little said. \"I think as far as the king is concerned, he just has to shrug his shoulders and get on with the job in hand.\" [King Charles III](https://www.insider.com/king-charles-coronation-british-monarchy-popularity-modern-criticism-2023-5) has been establishing himself as a new kind of monarch since taking the throne. In the days, weeks, and months since he took the throne on September 8, 2022, Charles has been slowly showing the UK and the world the kind of monarch he will be \u2014 a leader who is different from his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, but still carries on her legacy. As Bob Morris, an honorary senior research associate in the Constitution Unit at the University of London who studies royal issues, told Insider, some of King Charles' strongest moments as monarch have been those in which he's differentiated himself from the Queen with more modern moves. The British monarch is the head of the Church of England, but the king's statement signaled an intention to be an inclusive leader. \"He made that statement very swiftly and very importantly, I thought,\" Morris said. As Insider previously reported, the king also [directly condemned](https://www.insider.com/king-charles-condemns-russia-ukraine-war-queen-elizabeth-2023-2) Russia's \"unprovoked full-scale attack\" on Ukraine in a press statement, which the Queen had avoided, and he planned a \" [slimmed-down](https://www.insider.com/king-charles-coronation-smaller-skip-ancient-tradition-royal-family-2022-10)\" [coronation](https://www.insider.com/king-charles-coronation-smaller-skip-ancient-tradition-royal-family-2022-10) with less fanfare than his mother's 1953 ceremony. King Charles will hold a reception on Friday for world leaders gathered in London for his coronation this weekend, the biggest ceremonial event to be staged in Britain for 70 years. Charles, 74, and his wife Camilla will be crowned at London's Westminster Abbey in a glittering but solemn religious ceremony with traditions dating back some 1,000 years, followed by a procession, resplendent with pomp and pageantry. Royal fans have been gathering on The Mall, the grand boulevard that leads to Buckingham Palace, and heads of state and global dignitaries have been arriving in the British capital ahead of Saturday's event. \"It's an honor to represent the United States for this historic moment and celebrate the special relationship between our countries,\" U.S. first lady Jill Biden said on Twitter before leaving for Britain. She will be among the world leaders attending the reception at Buckingham Palace on Friday evening which the king and queen will host along with other senior members of the royal family. Earlier, Charles will hold a meeting of leaders from the Commonwealth of Nations, the voluntary associations of 56 countries which he also heads, while he will also greet prime ministers and royal representatives from the 14 other realms where he is head of state, including Australia and Canada. The leaders of Australia and New Zealand will pledge their allegiance to King Charles at his coronation on Saturday even though both are life-long republicans who do not shy away from making their positions clear. Across Britain, preparations are underway for the first coronation since 1953 when his mother Queen Elizabeth was crowned. The king has even voiced announcements for the London underground network, reminding passengers to \"mind the gap.\" Charles automatically became king after the queen's death at 96 last September but the coronation, although not essential, is regarded as a hugely symbolic moment which legitimizes the monarch in a public way. Set against the backdrop of a cost of living crisis, some public skepticism and in a modern era when questions are being posed about the future of the institution, its role and finances, Saturday's event will be on a smaller scale than the previous one 70 years ago. Nonetheless it will be a lavish occasion. The St Edward's Crown, which weighs about 2.2 kg (4 lb 12 ounces) and dates back to 1661 and the reign of his namesake King Charles II, will be placed on his head during the ceremony. For the first time in 900 years, royalty from around the world has been invited to a British coronation. [See the full guest list](https://www.insider.com/international-royals-attending-king-charles-coronation-2023-4#princess-charlene-and-prince-albert-ii-of-monaco-2). King Charles III, a man who waited almost 74 years to become king, will be crowned Saturday at Westminster Abbey with all the pomp and pageantry Britain can muster. And it can muster a lot. There will be crowns and diamonds, soaring music and, perhaps, a thunderous pledge of allegiance from Charles' subjects around the country. To top it off, 4,000 troops will march to Buckingham Palace in the post-ceremony procession, making it Britain's biggest military parade in 70 years. Bringing up the rear will be the newly crowned king and queen in a 261-year-old carriage gilded from nose to tail in glittering gold. \"Even in a world where people are sated with on-demand entertainment, people will stop and stare,\" said Michael Cole, a former BBC royal correspondent, \"because it will be a spectacular procession and a ritual, a ceremony, unlike anything that occurs anywhere in the world.\" But like the best dramas, it's a show with a message. For 1,000 years and more, British monarchs have been crowned in grandiose ceremonies that confirm their right to rule. Although the king no longer has executive or political power, he remains the U.K.'s head of state and a symbol of national identity. At a time when double-digit inflation is making everyone in the U.K. poorer and people who want to ditch the monarchy for a republic are preparing to protest with shouts of \"not my king,\" Charles is keen to show that he can still be a unifying force in a multicultural nation that is very different from the one that greeted his mother. So this will be a shorter, less formal affair than the three-hour coronation for Queen Elizabeth II. In 1953, Westminster Abbey was fitted with temporary stands to boost the seating capacity to more than 8,000, aristocrats wore crimson robes and coronets, and the coronation procession meandered 5 miles (8 kilometers) through central London so an estimated 3 million people could cheer for the glamorous 25-year-old queen. Organizers have cut Charles' service to less than two hours and sent out 2,300 invitations. Aristocrats have been told to avoid ceremonial dress and the procession will travel a shorter, direct route back to Buckingham Palace from the abbey. This follows Charles' instructions for a pared down ceremony as he seeks to create a smaller, less expensive royal machine for the 21st century. Built around the theme \"Called to Serve,\" the coronation service will begin with one of the youngest members of the congregation \u2014 a Chapel Royal chorister \u2014 greeting the king. Charles will respond by saying, \"In His name and after His example, I come not to be served but to serve.\" The moment is meant to underscore the importance of young people \u2014 and is a new addition in a service laden with the rituals through which power has been passed down to new monarchs throughout the centuries. But it is not the only innovation. Charles has scrapped the traditional moment at the end of the service when nobles were asked to kneel and pledge their loyalty to the king. Instead, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will invite everyone in the abbey and people watching on television to swear \"true allegiance\" to the monarch. The pledge has sparked debate in Britain, with some observers suggesting it was a tone-deaf effort to demand public support for Charles. Welby responded by saying it wasn't a command and people can decide for themselves whether to take part. The public's response to Charles, though, during the service and along the parade route, is key, said George Gross, a visiting research fellow at King's College, London and an expert on coronations. \"None of this matters if the public don't show up,'' Gross said. ''If they don't care, then the whole thing doesn't really work. It is all about this interaction.'' And today's public is very different from the audience that saw Elizabeth crowned. Almost 20% of the population now come from ethnic minority groups, compared with less than 1% in the 1950s. More than 300 languages are spoken in British schools, and less than half of the population describe themselves as Christian. Although organizers say the coronation remains a \"sacred Anglican service,\" the ceremony will for the first time include the active participation of other faiths, including representatives of the Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh traditions.

King Charles III's coronation is a chance to unite people with the history and pageantry of the monarchy, but those traditions are also full of potential controversies as he tries to show that the monarchy still has a role to play in modern Britain. The new king has already recognized these challenges by adjusting the coronation festivities to the realities of today. This coronation will be shorter and more inclusive than his mother's in 1953. Faith leaders from outside the Church of England will take an active role in the ceremony for the first time. And people from all four nations of the United Kingdom, as well as the Commonwealth, will take part. Here are five artifacts that will play a central role in Saturday's events. THE CORONATION CHAIR AND STONE OF SCONE King Charles III will sit atop more than 1,500 years of Irish, Scottish and English history when he is crowned Saturday at Westminster Abbey. The crown will be placed on Charles' head as he sits in the Coronation Chair suspended over the Stone of Scone (pronounced \"scoon\") \u2014 the sacred slab of sandstone on which Scottish kings were crowned. The chair has been part of every coronation since 1308. The 2.05-meter (6 feet 9 inches) tall chair is made of oak and was originally covered in gold leaf and colored glass. The gold has long since worn away and the chair is now pocked with graffiti, including one message that reads \"P. Abbott slept in this chair 5-6 July 1800.\" Edward I had the chair built specifically to enclose the Stone of Scone, known by Scots as the Stone of Destiny, after he forcibly took the artifact from Scotland and moved it to the abbey in the late 13th Century. The stone's history goes back much further, however. Fergus Mor MacEirc, the founder of Scotland's royal line, reputedly brought the stone with him when he moved his seat from Ireland to Scotland around 498, Westminster Abbey said. Before that time, it was used as the coronation stone for Irish kings. In 1996, Prime Minister John Major returned the stone to Scotland, with the understanding that it would come back to England for use in future coronations. In recent days, the stone was temporarily removed from its current home at Edinburgh Castle in a ceremony overseen by Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf, then transported to the abbey, where a special service was held to mark its return. CORONATION SPOON The gold-plated silver Coronation Spoon is the only piece of the coronation regalia that survived the English Civil War. After King Charles I was executed in 1649, the rest of the collection was either melted down or sold off as Parliament sought to abolish the monarchy forever. The spoon is central to the most sacred part of the coronation ceremony, when the Archbishop of Canterbury will pour holy oil from an eagle-shaped ampulla, or flask, into the spoon and then rub it on the king's hands, breast and head. The ceremony has roots in the biblical story of the anointing of King Solomon and was originally designed to confirm that the sovereign was appointed directly by God. While the monarch is no longer considered divine, the ceremony confirms his status as supreme governor of the Church of England. The 26.7-centimeter (10.5-inch) spoon is believed to have been made during the 12th Century for either King Henry II or King Richard I, and may have originally been used for mixing water and wine, according to the Royal Collection Trust. THE CULLINAN DIAMOND Two stones cut from the Cullinan Diamond \u2014 the largest rough diamond ever found \u2014 will feature prominently in the coronation, fueling controversy the royal family would rather avoid. For many in South Africa, where the original stone was found in 1905, the gems are a symbol of colonial oppression under British rule and they should be returned. Cullinan I, a huge drop-shaped stone weighing 530.2 carats, is mounted in the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. On Saturday, the scepter will be handed to Charles as a symbol of his temporal power. Cullinan II, a cushion-shaped gem of 317.4 carats, is mounted on the front of the Imperial State Crown that Charles will wear as he leaves Westminster Abbey. Charles sidestepped a similar controversy when Buckingham Palace announced that his wife, Camilla, wouldn't wear the crown of Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother, on coronation day. That crown contains the famous Koh-i-noor diamond that India, Pakistan and Iran all claim. The gem became part of the Crown Jewels after 11-year-old Maharaja Duleep Singh was forced to surrender it after the conquest of the Punjab in 1849. ST. EDWARD'S CROWN The crowning moment of the coronation ceremony will occur, literally, when the Archbishop of Canterbury places St. Edward's Crown on Charles' head. Because of its significance as the centerpiece of the coronation, this will be the only time during his reign that the monarch will wear the solid gold crown, which features a purple velvet cap, ermine band and criss-crossed arches topped by a cross. After the ceremony, Charles will swap the 2.08-kilogram (4.6-pound) crown for the Imperial State Crown, which weighs about half as much, for the procession back to Buckingham Palace. Queen Elizabeth II once said that even the lighter crown was tricky because it would fall off if she didn't keep her head upright while reading the annual speech at the state opening of Parliament. \"There are some disadvantages to crowns, but otherwise they're quite important things,\" the late queen told Sky News in 2018, flashing a smile. The current St. Edward's Crown was made for the coronation of King Charles II in 1661 and has been used in every coronation since then. It is a replica of the original crown, which was created in the 11th century and melted down after the execution of Charles I in 1649. The crown glitters with stones including tourmalines, spinel and aquamarines. Until the early 20th century, the crown was decorated with rented stones that were returned after the coronation, according to the Royal Collection Trust. It was permanently set with semi-precious stones ahead of the coronation of George V in 1911. THE GOLD STATE COACH King Charles III and Queen Camilla will travel back to Buckingham Palace from Westminster Abbey in the Gold State Coach, a 261-year-old relic that is renowned as much for its uncomfortable ride as its lavish decoration. The coach was built in 1762 under the reign of King George III and it has been used in every coronation since 1831. It is made of wood and plated with gold leaf, from the cherubs on the roof to the Greek sea gods over each wheel. About the only things that aren't gilded are the side panels painted with Roman gods and goddesses and, of course, the interior, which is upholstered in satin and velvet. But the coach is heavy \u2014 four tons \u2014 and old, meaning it only ever travels at walking speed. And while it may look luxurious, the coach features a notoriously bumpy ride because it is slung from leather straps rather than modern metal springs. The late queen wasn't a fan. \"Horrible! It's not meant for traveling in at all,\" she said in 2018 in an interview with Sky News. \"Not very comfortable.\" That's one reason Charles and Camilla will ride to the coronation in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach, which is equipped with hydraulic shock absorbers, as well as heat and air conditioning. The ceremony will take place at [Westminster Abbey](https://www.insider.com/king-charles-coronation-schedule-guide-timeline-2023-5), where coronations have been held for the last 900 years. When they process through the nave of Westminster Abbey for the ceremony itself, four pages of honor will accompany each of them. [Prince George](https://www.insider.com/photos-prince-george-princess-charlotte-in-wales-queen-platinum-jubilee-2022-6) will serve as one of the king's pages, and Camilla's grandsons and great-nephew will accompany her. About 2,200 guests are expected to fill Westminster Abbey to capacity for the event. The ceremony itself consists of five phases. It kicks off with King Charles being presented to the attendees, who then greet him with \"God Save the King!\" Next, the king makes his oath, promising to support the Church of England and the law. In the third phase, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will conduct the anointing. The fourth step is the investiture, where King Charles will receive his royal regalia, including the crown his mother wore when she was crowned over 70 years ago. The ceremony ends with the enthronement and homage, where the king will sit on his throne for the first time. Traditionally, all of the royal dukes then kneel to pay homage to the monarch, but Charles will only have Prince William perform this rite. \u2014Roya Nikkhah (@RoyaNikkhah) [January 7, 2023] King Charles and Camilla, the Queen Consort, will each wear two [robes during their coronation](https://www.insider.com/hidden-details-camillas-coronation-robe-once-worn-by-queen-elizabeth-2023-4). Camilla will first wear the Robe of State that Queen Elizabeth wore to her coronation in 1953. She will then change into a personalized Robe of Estate whose details are rife with meaning. For the first time, according to the royal family's website, the Robe of Estate will include designs of insects. The stitching will consist of bees and a beetle, each representing \"Their Majesties' affection for the natural world.\" Continuing with the natural-world theme, the robe includes several plants and flowers. King Charles III will wear the same vestments his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, wore during her coronation -- the Supertunica and the Imperial Mantle. During the investiture, Charles will wear an embroidered Supertunica made of gold silk. Over that garment, he will wear the Imperial Mantle made for King George IV in 1821. \"Both the Supertunica and the Imperial Mantle were last worn at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, on 2nd June, 1953, so they haven't been worn for 70 years. As part of our care of items in the collection, obviously they're very carefully looked after,\" said Caroline de Guitaut, Deputy surveyor of The King's Works of Art for the Royal Collection Trust. \"So, a very long tradition of re-wearing these two pieces, and that is what gives them incredible symbolism and of course their great significance and sense of place in history.\" Over the golden Supertunica, Charles will wear the Imperial Mantle made for King George IV in 1821. King Charles III surprised cheering fans who started gathering outside Buckingham Palace on Friday, a day ahead of his coronation, as final touches were made in preparation for an occasion that London hasn't celebrated in 70 years. People in the crowd screamed his name as Charles stepped from a chauffeur-driven Bentley wearing a blue suit. One person could be heard yelling \"God save the king\" as the British monarch approached the throng lined up behind a barricade. Charles thanked the well-wishers for coming, shaking hands as he slowly moved along the line. Theresa Iredale, wearing a plastic crown, said she trembled when the king approached her after she screamed his name. \"I saw his hand coming out to mine and I was like, 'I can't believe I'm shaking the king's hand,'\" she said.
