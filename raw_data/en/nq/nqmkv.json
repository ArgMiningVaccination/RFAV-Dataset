From that day forward her goal has been to improve and extend the lives of pets with compassionate thorough care. In addition to practicing exceptional conventional medicine, Dr. Ruskin also practices several holistic healing modalities: acupuncture, aqua-puncture, High dose IV vitamin C infusions, herbal medicine, nutraceuticals, pulsed electromagnetic therapy, energy medicine, joint infusions, and homeopathy. Dr. Ruskin learned much of her holistic medicine skills from the famous Dr. Marty Goldstein during a 13 year associateship in his practice. In 2019 Dr. Ruskin was featured in the documentary film \"The Dog Doc\" and was a contributing author to Dr. Marty Goldstein's latest book, The Spirit of Animal Healing. As a veterinarian and medical director at VCA Animal Healing Center, Dr. Ruskin plans to be all-paws-in for a bright future of healthy pets, exceptional service, and heartfelt care. She shares her home with two cats that have plenty of cattitude, and she plans to rescue another Pomeranian, which will be her eighth in a lifetime of being a pompom-mix mom. Her favorite things to do when she isn't thinking about pet health are dancing, roller-skating, flower gardening, and wine tasting. "}
