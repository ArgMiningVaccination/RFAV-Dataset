The genus includes human and animal pathogens that produce potent exotoxins that cause rapid and potentially fatal diseases responsible for countless human casualties and billion-dollar annual loss to the agricultural sector. Diseases include botulism, tetanus, enterotoxemia, gas gangrene, necrotic enteritis, pseudomembranous colitis, blackleg, and black disease, which are caused by pathogenic Clostridium. Due to their ability to sporulate, they cannot be eradicated from the environment. As such, immunization with toxoid or bacterin-toxoid vaccines is the only protective method against infection. Toxins recovered from Clostridium cultures are inactivated to form toxoids, which are then formulated into multivalent vaccines. This review discusses the toxins, diseases, and toxoid production processes of the most common pathogenic Clostridium species, including Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium tetani, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium chauvoei, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium novyi and Clostridium hemolyticum.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-09-11", "cleaned_text": "Vaccine Production to Protect Animals Against Pathogenic Clostridia [https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins11090525](https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins11090525) [Characterization and Clostridium species are of special importance for their ability to infect humans and animals. Infections can cause severe illnesses, generally mediated by the release of potent toxins. Due to its pervasiveness, Clostridium infections can occur in multiple ways, including contaminated food containing either vegetative cells, spores, or pre-formed toxin(s) [ [2](#B2-toxins-11-00525)]. Moreover, deep wounds, lacerations, or burns with a favorable anaerobic environment are also considered portals of entry for pathogenic Clostridium [ [3](#B3-toxins-11-00525)]. [4](#B4-toxins-11-00525), [5](#B5-toxins-11-00525), [6](#B6-toxins-11-00525)]. However, alterations such as the disruption of the gut microbiota by the use of antibiotics, damage caused by medically induced abortions, parasites, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or diseases such as cancer or neutropenia can favor Clostridium pathogenesis [ [3](#B3-toxins-11-00525)]. Clostridium exotoxins cause to fatal the gastrointestinal tract (enterotoxins), soft-tissues, and Clostridium tetani produce two of the most powerful toxins known to man, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins (BoNT and TeNT), causing botulism and tetanus, respectively [ [8](#B8-toxins-11-00525)]. The wide range of toxins produced by different Clostridium perfringens toxinotypes are responsible for different diseases, such as poisoning, enterotoxemia, gas gangrene, and necrotic enteritis [ colitis, blackleg, black disease, and non-traumatic gas gangrene are also other well-known diseases associated with the toxins produced by or the rising incidence of C. difficle (arguably a distinct genus) infections [ [16](#B16-toxins-11-00525)]. Infections also hurt the agricultural economic sector. Animal clostridiosis infections are probably more frequent and certainly less reported than human clostridia infections. Practices without the proper hygiene control, such as animal castration, vaccination, foot-trimming, marking, dehorning, dog bites, or the improper care of birth associated wounds are important contributing factors to tetanus, botulism, or gas gangrene in animals [ [4](#B4-toxins-11-00525), [17](#B17-toxins-11-00525), [18](#B18-toxins-11-00525), [19](#B19-toxins-11-00525)]. The sudden change in feeding or the improper supplementation of protein and phosphorus can lead to pulpy kidney or botulism [ [12](#B12-toxins-11-00525), [18](#B18-toxins-11-00525)]. Finally, parasites such as liver flukes and coccidia can induce the development of black disease and necrotic enteritis [ [20](#B20-toxins-11-00525), [21](#B21-toxins-11-00525)]. [22](#B22-toxins-11-00525)]. Here, we review the production processes of several bacterin-toxoid vaccines to protect against animal pathogenic Clostridium species, including C. botulinum, C. tetani, C. perfringens, [Figure 1](#toxins-11-00525-f001)). Furthermore, a brief description of the diseases caused by the toxins of the latter Clostridium and their virulence regulation is also included. The present work does not include C. difficile, as there are no commercially available vaccines for the prevention of its disease in animals. 2. Clostridium botulinum [23](#B23-toxins-11-00525), [24](#B24-toxins-11-00525)]. Group I is formed by mesophilic and proteolytic strains that readily digest casein or meat proteins and some carbohydrates, while Group II is psychrotrophic and non-proteolytic but able to ferment different sugars. These two groups account for most of the human botulism cases [ [25](#B25-toxins-11-00525), [26](#B26-toxins-11-00525)]. Group III is proteolytic and saccharolytic and affects animals predominantly [ [27](#B27-toxins-11-00525)]. Formerly group IV, now C. argentinense, is proteolytic and non-saccharolytic, and has not been associated with botulism cases [ [28](#B28-toxins-11-00525)]. The genes encoding BoNTs can be found in the chromosome, plasmids, or phages and are classically classified into seven different serotypes (A-G) [ [26](#B26-toxins-11-00525)]. Group I produces serotypes A, B, E, and F, and Group II produces type B, E, and F. Group III produces toxynotypes C and D and C. argentinense produces type G ( [Table 1](#toxins-11-00525-t001)). More recently, and due to faster and cheaper high-throughput sequencing techniques and bioinformatics, novel BoNTs have been BoNT-H [30](#B30-toxins-11-00525), [31](#B31-toxins-11-00525)]. [32](#B32-toxins-11-00525)]. Infant and botulism are considered the most frequent form of botulism in humans [ [28](#B28-toxins-11-00525), [33](#B33-toxins-11-00525)]. Although less common, botulism can also be contracted through the colonization of wounds, inhalation of the toxin, or by the improper clinical or cosmetic use of the toxin (iatrogenic) [ [28](#B28-toxins-11-00525)]. In animals, contaminated or spoiled feed, cannibalism (poultry), bone chewing, and stagnant waters are all sources of infection [ [18](#B18-toxins-11-00525), [34](#B34-toxins-11-00525)]. In Australia, bone chewing in cattle is linked with the lack of phosphorous in the soil of pastoral areas. The use of poultry litter as fertilizer of pastures has also been identified as a major source of botulism outbreaks [ [35](#B35-toxins-11-00525)]. [36](#B36-toxins-11-00525)]. When BoNT reaches the neuromuscular junction the heavy chain binds to the cholinergic nerve terminal, entering the cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the metalloprotease activity of the light chain will cleave cytosolic SNARE proteins, preventing the release of neurotransmitter and causing flaccid muscle paralysis. For a more detailed explanation of the mechanisms of action of BoNT, please refer to previous work [ [37](#B37-toxins-11-00525)]. [38](#B38-toxins-11-00525)]. Two agr-like quorum sensing systems have been identified in the proteolytic group of C. botulinum\u2014while one controls sporulation, the other one controls toxin production [ [39](#B39-toxins-11-00525)]. Two-component systems and the transition state regulator CodY have also been shown to be involved in toxin production regulation [ [40](#B40-toxins-11-00525), [41](#B41-toxins-11-00525)]. C. botulinum Vaccine Production [42](#B42-toxins-11-00525)]. Until recently, people at high risk or exposed to the toxin, i.e., researchers and sectors of the military force, were immunized against the disease using the investigational pentavalent botulinum toxoid (PBT) vaccine (BoNT/A-E). However, this vaccine was discontinued as it was losing potency [ [43](#B43-toxins-11-00525)]. Human botulism cases, especially those associated with food-borne botulism, have been decreasing since 1950 [ [44](#B44-toxins-11-00525), [45](#B45-toxins-11-00525)], most likely due to the public awareness and good practices in food preparation and sterilization advances in the food industry. BoNT has also been used as a therapeutic agent for treating neuro-ophthalmologic diseases and as a cosmetic treatment for facial rejuvenation (i.e., Botox\u00ae, Dysport\u00ae) [ [46](#B46-toxins-11-00525)]. [47](#B47-toxins-11-00525), [48](#B48-toxins-11-00525)]. In Europe, animal botulism is considered an emerging disease [ [49](#B49-toxins-11-00525), [50](#B50-toxins-11-00525)]. Contrary to humans, animal vaccines are available in the market from a number of different producers. Livestock can be protected with the bivalent (BoNT/C-D) toxoid vaccine [ [51](#B51-toxins-11-00525), [52](#B52-toxins-11-00525)] and immunization with BoNT/B toxoid vaccine is also recommended for horses [ [53](#B53-toxins-11-00525)]. The use of vaccination as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) enhanced survival, delayed the progression of characteristic signs, and reduced the severity of the disease in monkeys [ [54](#B54-toxins-11-00525)]. In cattle, the use of vaccination is a therapeutic treatment during outbreaks [ [53](#B53-toxins-11-00525)]. [55](#B55-toxins-11-00525), [56](#B56-toxins-11-00525)]. Maximum toxin concentration can be attained after 24 h of fermentation [ [57](#B57-toxins-11-00525), [58](#B58-toxins-11-00525)]. The inactivation of BoNT for toxoid vaccine production is accomplished by formaldehyde treatment [ [59](#B59-toxins-11-00525)] ( [Figure 2](#toxins-11-00525-f002)). [26](#B26-toxins-11-00525)]. Glucose is metabolized by both groups and is needed to promote toxin production in Group I [ [60](#B60-toxins-11-00525)]. Amino acids, such as arginine and tryptophan, are required by Group I and II, respectively, for growth and toxin synthesis. However, the oversupply of these amino acids has a negative impact on BoNT production [ [60](#B60-toxins-11-00525)]. Chemically defined media have been investigated with low success. While showing good growth and sporulation, the amount of toxin produced is considerably reduced [ [61](#B61-toxins-11-00525), [62](#B62-toxins-11-00525)]. Importantly, different fermentation approaches, such as the use of dialysis sacs, have been shown to improve BoNT titers [ [61](#B61-toxins-11-00525)]. Moreover, HC- BoNT/B, and HC-BoNT/E protected mice from a multitoxin challenge [ [63](#B63-toxins-11-00525)]. On the other hand, the human recombinant botulinum vaccine A/B (rBV A/B) expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris has been shown to protect mice and non-human primates. However, it was withdrawn from clinical trial phase 3 by the sponsor due to product manufacturing issues and redesign of the study (please refer to: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT01940315). For a more detailed review about the new generation of vaccines against botulism, refer to previous work [ [64](#B64-toxins-11-00525)]. 3. Clostridium tetani [65](#B65-toxins-11-00525)], with approximately 1 million human tetanus cases resulting in 200,000 deaths per year worldwide [ [66](#B66-toxins-11-00525)]. The clinical features of the disease are present in records that date back to the 5th century BC [ [67](#B67-toxins-11-00525)], yet it remains an important disease in the present day. Presently, the diseases occurs principally in non-industrialized countries that lack vaccination programs and have poor health infrastructure [ [68](#B68-toxins-11-00525)]. C. tetani is a ubiquitous organism that can be found in the environment irrespective of the geographical location [ [13](#B13-toxins-11-00525), [69](#B69-toxins-11-00525)], and in the gastrointestinal tracts and feces of humans and animals [ [1](#B1-toxins-11-00525)]. Tetanus occurs when C. tetani spores enter the host through puncture wounds, lacerations, burns, or compound fractures [ [70](#B70-toxins-11-00525), [71](#B71-toxins-11-00525)]. Sadly, the improper sterilization of surgical instruments used to cut the umbilical cord is the principal cause of neonatal tetanus, a relatively common condition in developing countries with poor health infrastructure [ [14](#B14-toxins-11-00525)]. In animals, wounds caused by castration, tailing, tagging, shear cuts, and fight bites are associated with C. tetani infections [ [4](#B4-toxins-11-00525), [72](#B72-toxins-11-00525), [73](#B73-toxins-11-00525), [74](#B74-toxins-11-00525)]. Horses are the most susceptible animals, followed by small ruminants [ [4](#B4-toxins-11-00525), [75](#B75-toxins-11-00525)]. [76](#B76-toxins-11-00525)]. Like the botulinum toxin, after release, pTeNT undergoes a catalytic process that cleaves the protein into a heavy (~100 kDa) and a light chain (~50 kDa) attached by a disulphide bridge [ [77](#B77-toxins-11-00525)]. The heavy chain binds to the motor neuron nerve terminals. Once internalized, it is retrogradely transported to the spinal cord, where it migrates to the inhibitory interneurons [ [78](#B78-toxins-11-00525)]. The light chain, containing the zinc metalloprotease activity, cleaves the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin, [77](#B77-toxins-11-00525), [79](#B79-toxins-11-00525), [80](#B80-toxins-11-00525), [81](#B81-toxins-11-00525)]. The absence of inhibitory impulses leads to continuous muscle contractions primarily seen in the jaw and neck muscles (lockjaw). TeNT not only causes muscle spasms but also affects the neurocirculatory, neuroendocrine, and vegetative nervous systems [ [65](#B65-toxins-11-00525)]. The incubation time, which goes from the time of injury to the first symptoms, is between 7 to 10 days [ [1](#B1-toxins-11-00525), [67](#B67-toxins-11-00525)], and it has been reported that shorter incubation periods are associated with higher mortality rates [ [82](#B82-toxins-11-00525)]. [83](#B83-toxins-11-00525)]. This regulator belongs to the same subgroup of -70 factors of RNA polymerase as BotR (C. botulinum), TcdR (C. difficile), the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin tetanolysin O are other virulence factors believed to help during infection, contributing to the loss of tissue integrity of the host [ [13](#B13-toxins-11-00525), [86](#B86-toxins-11-00525)]. However, apart from the toxin regulator, studies about the molecular aspects that control C. tetani toxinogenesis are non-existent. C. tetani Vaccine Production [4](#B4-toxins-11-00525), [87](#B87-toxins-11-00525), [88](#B88-toxins-11-00525)]. Nevertheless, tetanus can be effectively prevented by vaccination. The tetanus toxoid vaccine was developed by Ramon and collaborators in the early 1920s [ [89](#B89-toxins-11-00525)]. Since the availability of the vaccine, tetanus cases have significantly declined. For example, World War II saw substantially less tetanus-related deaths compared to World War I, when the vaccine was not yet accessible [ [90](#B90-toxins-11-00525)]. The incidence of tetanus in animals has also decreased due to consistent immunization programs [ [88](#B88-toxins-11-00525)]. [91](#B91-toxins-11-00525)]. Although C. tetani grows for ~48 h, the proteolytic activation of TeNT occurs after the autolysis stage [ [91](#B91-toxins-11-00525)]. It is believed that TeNT is released to the extracellular environment by autolysis, as no toxin transporter has been described yet [ [86](#B86-toxins-11-00525)]. TeNT is inactivated by formaldehyde to produce the toxoid [ [89](#B89-toxins-11-00525)]. Subsequently, the toxoid is further purified from the detoxified cultures by methods such as ammonium sulphate precipitation [ [92](#B92-toxins-11-00525)], ultrafiltration [ [93](#B93-toxins-11-00525)], tangential [94](#B94-toxins-11-00525), [95](#B95-toxins-11-00525)], or chromatography [ [96](#B96-toxins-11-00525)]. [97](#B97-toxins-11-00525)], with the subsequent modifications made by Latham et al. [ [98](#B98-toxins-11-00525)]. The complex growth medium contains glucose, vitamins, inorganic salts, and pancreatic digest of casein as the main source of amino acids and peptides [ [91](#B91-toxins-11-00525)]. The concentrations of free amino acids in the medium play important roles in toxin production. High concentrations (10 g/L) of free amino acids inhibit toxin production, with glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, effect [ [99](#B99-toxins-11-00525), [100](#B100-toxins-11-00525)]. Additionally, peptides are also crucial for toxin production, especially histidine containing peptides and short hydrophobic peptides containing proline [ [101](#B101-toxins-11-00525), [102](#B102-toxins-11-00525)]. The pancreatic digest of casein can be fully replaced by soy peptone, avoiding the use of animal-derived products [ [103](#B103-toxins-11-00525), [104](#B104-toxins-11-00525)]. Glucose is another component that has an impact on toxin production, yet it is not fully consumed from the fermentation medium [ [91](#B91-toxins-11-00525)]. Latham et al. showed that if the initial concentration of glucose was reduced, toxin was not produced [ [98](#B98-toxins-11-00525)]. During the sterilization of the medium, glucose reacts with the amino acids and peptides, forming Maillard reaction products favorable for toxin production [ [98](#B98-toxins-11-00525), [105](#B105-toxins-11-00525)]. Moreover, other fermentation settings, such as fed-batch with the addition of glucose at fixed times [ [106](#B106-toxins-11-00525)] or continuous cultures with total consumption of glucose [ [107](#B107-toxins-11-00525)], increase toxin production. Zacharias and Bj\u00f6rklund also showed the addition of potassium chloride to continuous cultures at pH 7.4 and temperature of 34 \u00b0C increased toxin titers [ [107](#B107-toxins-11-00525)]. Finally, high concentration of toxin has been obtained by culturing C. tetani inside cellophane dialysis sacs [ [108](#B108-toxins-11-00525), [109](#B109-toxins-11-00525)]. However, they could not be implemented at large scale [ [107](#B107-toxins-11-00525)]. [110](#B110-toxins-11-00525)]. However, more recently, efforts have focused on developing recombinant vaccines using the tetanus toxin C-fragment of the heavy chain (TeNT-Hc), which has immunogenic properties comparable to the native toxin [ [111](#B111-toxins-11-00525), [112](#B112-toxins-11-00525), [113](#B113-toxins-11-00525), [114](#B114-toxins-11-00525), [115](#B115-toxins-11-00525)]. This subunit vaccine showed good results in mice and rats but required more immunizing doses in monkeys [ [113](#B113-toxins-11-00525)]. Although preclinical studies look promising, there is no recombinant tetanus vaccine available in the market yet. 4. Clostridium perfringens [9](#B9-toxins-11-00525)]. Previously classified into five toxinotypes, C. perfringens has been reclassified into seven toxinotypes (A-G) depending on the toxin they produce: alpha epsilon C. perfringens toxins are encoded in large plasmids ranging from 45 kb to 140 kb, with the exception of CPA and perfringolysin O (PFO), which are located on the chromosome. CPE can also be found in the chromosome or on plasmids. Most of these plasmids are conjugative and have a region known as the tcp locus, which is believed to contribute to the spread of toxin genes and resistance determinants among strains [ [116](#B116-toxins-11-00525)]. Most diseases caused by C. perfringens isolates are mediated by one or more of these toxins acting synergistically [ [9](#B9-toxins-11-00525)]. [117](#B117-toxins-11-00525)]. Depending on where the toxins are produced, C. perfringens causes histotoxic, enteric, or systemic diseases. Infection of wounds can lead to clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene), whereas the production of toxins in the intestines can derive into enteritis or enterocolitis. Intestinal infections may progress into enterotoxemia when toxins are absorbed into the bloodstream, affecting distant organs, such as the kidneys, lungs, or the brain [ [117](#B117-toxins-11-00525)]. A brief description of the toxins and their associated diseases are described below, however, for a more exhaustive review, please refer to previous work [ [118](#B118-toxins-11-00525)]. 4.1. Alpha Toxin (CPA) [119](#B119-toxins-11-00525)], which causes traumatic clostridial myonecrosis in both humans and animals. Crush-type injuries, open fractures, and penetrating wounds are common portals of entry for C. perfringens [ [3](#B3-toxins-11-00525)]. The disease can progress rapidly, necrotizing surrounding tissue in hours and producing a foul smell and gas bubbles characteristic of the disease (gas gangrene). Mortality rates in human adults are high, around 67% to 100% during the first 24 h, and treatment requires adequate antibiotics and surgical debridement or amputation [ [120](#B120-toxins-11-00525)]. Two toxins are implicated in this condition, CPA and PFO. While the zinc metallophospholipase CPA is essential for pathogenesis, PFO, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, is not required for lethality but contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease [ [121](#B121-toxins-11-00525)]. [118](#B118-toxins-11-00525), [122](#B122-toxins-11-00525)]. Similarly, it was believed that CPA was the main toxin responsible for causing necrotic enteritis (NE) in chickens [ [123](#B123-toxins-11-00525)]. However, it was discovered that CPA is not essential and the disease is caused by NetB [ [124](#B124-toxins-11-00525)]. 4.2. Beta Toxin (CPB) [125](#B125-toxins-11-00525)]. [126](#B126-toxins-11-00525)]. The presence of trypsin inhibitors in the intestines allows the persistence of CPB, resulting in the damage of the gut epithelium and posterior entry into the bloodstream [ [127](#B127-toxins-11-00525)]. It is a rare but fatal disease marked by abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea and necrosis of the small intestine, and toxemia and shock in acute cases [ [128](#B128-toxins-11-00525), [129](#B129-toxins-11-00525)]. Historical outbreaks have been reported in post-World War II Germany and non-developed countries of Southeast Asia and Africa. In Papua New Guinea, EN was the second leading cause of death in children before the introduction of immunization programs with the CPB toxoid vaccine [ [130](#B130-toxins-11-00525)]. EN has also been reported in developed countries. People with reduced trypsin production and pancreatic disease (i.e., diabetes) are at higher risk of contracting the disease. However, very few sporadic cases have been reported since 1984 in the United States, England, and Australia [ [131](#B131-toxins-11-00525)]. [132](#B132-toxins-11-00525)]. The lack of competing flora and low levels of intestinal trypsin due to the consumption of colostrum, which has trypsin inhibitory activity, are risk factors. Type C outbreaks account for serious economic losses for the agricultural sector with fatality rates exceeding 50% and reaching 100% in unvaccinated herds [ [127](#B127-toxins-11-00525)]. [12](#B12-toxins-11-00525), is secreted as a prototoxin and is fully activated by the action of proteases in the gastrointestinal tract of animals and by lambda toxin (a metalloprotease synthetized by C. perfringens) [ [134](#B134-toxins-11-00525)]. Although there are no reports of naturally occurring ETX intoxication in humans, the CDC considers the toxin as a potential bioterrorism agent [ [135](#B135-toxins-11-00525)]. C. perfringens type D infections are more common than type B and have been associated with sudden change in the diet of animals. The abrupt change and large consumption of feed rich in fermentable carbohydrates disrupts the gut microflora, allowing the rapid growth of C. perfringens [ [12](#B12-toxins-11-00525)]. Coccidiosis and parasite infections, such as tape worms, can also make the animal more susceptible to type D infections [ [136](#B136-toxins-11-00525)]. The accumulation of ETX in the intestines increases permeability of the intestinal mucosa, allowing the toxin to be absorbed into the bloodstream. It then spreads to other organs, such as brain, lungs, and kidneys, where it causes edema and necrotic lesions [ [137](#B137-toxins-11-00525)]. 4.4. Iota Toxin (ITX) [138](#B138-toxins-11-00525)]. ITX consists of two non-covalently linked proteins and is produced as an inactive toxin. It is activated by several proteases, such as -chymotrypsin, pepsin, proteinase K, perfringens [ [139](#B139-toxins-11-00525)]. The binding component (Ib) binds to a proteinaceous receptor, such as the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) and CD44 glycoprotein, allowing the internalization the ADP-ribosyltransferase (Ia), disrupts the cell cytoskeleton [ [140](#B140-toxins-11-00525), [141](#B141-toxins-11-00525)]. C. perfringens type E also produces bacteriocin-like factors that favor growth over other strains and exploits the changes caused by ITX to increase adherence to enterocytes [ [142](#B142-toxins-11-00525)]. [118](#B118-toxins-11-00525)]. However, cross-reactivity between ITX and C. spiroforme iota-like toxin, which causes a similar disease in rabbits, has probably given misleading diagnosis of type E enterotoxemia in the past [ [143](#B143-toxins-11-00525)]. Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent type E outbreaks. 4.5. C. perfringens Enterotoxin (CPE) [144](#B144-toxins-11-00525)]. CPE infection is a common food poisoning cause in the United States [ [145](#B145-toxins-11-00525)], principally attributed to improper cooling and inadequate storing of food, allowing for germination and rapid growth. Under optimal growth conditions, C. perfringens has a generation time of 8 to 12 min, and as such, is one of the fastest growing known bacteria [ [9](#B9-toxins-11-00525)]. [146](#B146-toxins-11-00525)]. Symptoms last for short periods no longer than 24 h and are rarely fatal. CPE causes non-foodborne diseases, including antibiotic-associated diarrhea (ADD) and sporadic diarrhea (SD), which are sometimes potentiated by the production of beta2 (CPB2) toxin. While ADD is related to antimicrobial treatments, SD is considered to be non-antibiotic related. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), on the other hand, is a fatal disease seen in neonates that occurs when CPE is absorbed into the systemic circulation [ [144](#B144-toxins-11-00525)]. The role of CPE in animal disease is still not clear, although some reports suggest that it is associated with gastrointestinal disease in domestic and wild animals. There are no diagnostic criteria to establish a CPE-mediated animal disease [ [118](#B118-toxins-11-00525)]. 4.6. Necrotic Enteritis Beta-Like Toxin (NetB) [124](#B124-toxins-11-00525)]. Although the specific receptor for NetB has not been identified yet, NetB forms a pore allowing cations to enter the cell, causing cell rounding and lysis [ [147](#B147-toxins-11-00525), [148](#B148-toxins-11-00525)]. Globally, avian NE causes USD 2-6 billion of losses per year [ [149](#B149-toxins-11-00525)]. The immune state, nutrition, and intestinal health of the animals, and parasite infections such as coccidiosis, are predisposing factors for avian NE [ [150](#B150-toxins-11-00525), [151](#B151-toxins-11-00525)]. The disease can develop in peracute forms with deaths occurring within hours, or in clinical form, which causes diarrhea, ruffled feathers, anorexia, and depression [ [152](#B152-toxins-11-00525), [153](#B153-toxins-11-00525)]. The ban on the use of antibiotics has increased to subclinical necrotic enteritis (SNE) cases [ [154](#B154-toxins-11-00525)]. Although SNE mortality is very low, feed conversion is negatively affected, resulting in longer periods of growth and poor performance [ [154](#B154-toxins-11-00525)]. New preventive strategies to overcome this problem have focused on the design and development of probiotics and vaccines [ [155](#B155-toxins-11-00525), [156](#B156-toxins-11-00525)]. 4.7. C. perfringens Vaccines [157](#B157-toxins-11-00525)]. Purified toxin(s) or the whole culture are then chemically inactivated using formaldehyde, a time-consuming process that can lead to reduced immunogenicity [ [158](#B158-toxins-11-00525), [159](#B159-toxins-11-00525)]. Moreover, the ill-defined composition of the media leads to batch-to-batch variability and the continuous selection for strains that exhibit satisfactory toxin production [ [158](#B158-toxins-11-00525)]. [160](#B160-toxins-11-00525)]. Nevertheless, pigbel-related deaths in Papua New Guinea were considerably diminished after the introduction of a highly effective toxoid vaccine against C. perfringens type C disease. The experimental human CPB toxoid vaccine was prepared by obtaining the toxoid from the formalin-inactivated cultures using ammonium sulfate precipitation [ [130](#B130-toxins-11-00525)]. Although pigbel cases are still reported in the highlands of Papua New Guinea and other areas of the country, vaccine production was stopped in 1998 [ [161](#B161-toxins-11-00525)]. [119](#B119-toxins-11-00525), [160](#B160-toxins-11-00525), [162](#B162-toxins-11-00525), [163](#B163-toxins-11-00525), [164](#B164-toxins-11-00525)]. However, in some animal species, more than one round of vaccination might be required to achieve sustained immunity [ [165](#B165-toxins-11-00525)]. Commercial veterinary vaccines are polyvalent formulations of CPA, CPB, and ETX toxoid(s) or bacterin-toxoid(s) [ [158](#B158-toxins-11-00525)]. There are no commercial toxoids vaccines currently available that confer protection against ITX, CPE, or NetB. In 2005, a CPA toxoid vaccine was conditionally licensed by the FDA to control hemorrhagic bowel syndrome (HBS; or \"bloody gut\") in cattle caused by C. perfringens type A [ [166](#B166-toxins-11-00525)]. A CPA toxoid vaccine is also commercially available to control NE in chickens. However, it has been shown that the immunization with CPA toxoid vaccines resulted in variable levels of protection [ [167](#B167-toxins-11-00525)]. [168](#B168-toxins-11-00525), [169](#B169-toxins-11-00525)]. The development of chemically defined media allowed the study of amino acids and vitamins required for C. perfringens proliferation. These media supported growth but no toxin production could be detected if no peptides, either synthetic or animal derived, were added [ [170](#B170-toxins-11-00525)]. Fernandez-Miyakawa et al. [ [171](#B171-toxins-11-00525)] showed that CPA production was higher in brain-heart infusion (BHI), followed by cooked meat medium (CMM), and significantly less in tryptone glucose yeast (TGY) medium. On the other hand, Murata et al. [ [172](#B172-toxins-11-00525)] reported the production of high potency CPA from C. perfringens PB6K in a defined medium by adding large amounts of arginine. By replacing the meat component for tryptone-salts, Chou attained CPA production in continuous cultures [ [173](#B173-toxins-11-00525)]. [174](#B174-toxins-11-00525), [175](#B175-toxins-11-00525)]. Similarly, batch fermentations of C. perfringens type B are also reliant on glucose and peptone concentrations. High toxin titers have been achieved when growing C. perfringens type B in 5.0 g/L of meat or casein peptones in combination with 111.1 mM of glucose under controlled pH (6.5) conditions [ [157](#B157-toxins-11-00525)]. The importance of glucose or dextrin in combination with pH control has also been demonstrated in three different strains of C. perfringens type D [ [176](#B176-toxins-11-00525)]. [177](#B177-toxins-11-00525)]. The identification of these regulatory systems has helped to understand toxin production regulation in C perfringens. However, the extracellular signals that activate these pathways have not been elucidated. Both systems regulate CPA, and NetB [178](#B178-toxins-11-00525), and CPE synthesis [ [179](#B179-toxins-11-00525), [182](#B182-toxins-11-00525)]. Although the molecular mechanisms that regulate ITX remain unknown, data suggest that the VirS/VirR system regulates the activity but not the expression of ITX [ [177](#B177-toxins-11-00525)]. [183](#B183-toxins-11-00525)], while the administration of recombinant fused ETX-CPB vaccine in mice has shown an acceptable level of protection [ [184](#B184-toxins-11-00525)]. Also, a bivalent candidate vaccine comprising the C-terminal region of CPE and a subunit of the Shiga toxin (Escherichia coli) has shown protective and sustained immunity in mice [ [185](#B185-toxins-11-00525)]. Monovalent recombinant vaccines against CPA have also been shown to offer protective responses in mice [ [186](#B186-toxins-11-00525), [187](#B187-toxins-11-00525)], however, only partial protection in broiler chickens and cows were observed [ [159](#B159-toxins-11-00525), [188](#B188-toxins-11-00525)]. This might be associated with C. perfringens pathogenesis, which usually involves more than one toxin. Recombinant chimeric multivalent vaccines or a mixture of recombinant toxoids have shown an increased protective response in several animals in comparison with traditional monovalent or bivalent vaccines [ [158](#B158-toxins-11-00525), [159](#B159-toxins-11-00525), [189](#B189-toxins-11-00525)]. Similarly, recombinant NetB (rNetB) vaccine had proven to be effective when birds were challenged with mild oral dose of virulent bacteria but not against heavy in-feed challenges [ [190](#B190-toxins-11-00525)]. Moreover, significant protection was obtained when rNetB was used in combination with cell-free toxoids or bacterin preparations, indicating that avian NE, as well as other C. perfringens diseases, are multifactorial and the combination of antigens is necessary to evoke full immunity [ [190](#B190-toxins-11-00525)]. [191](#B191-toxins-11-00525)]. 5. Clostridium chauvoei [192](#B192-toxins-11-00525), [193](#B193-toxins-11-00525)]. Young cattle between 6- and 24-months of age are the most susceptible to blackleg, which commonly originates as a non-traumatic endogenous infection. In sheep, the disease can occur at all ages, and it has also been associated with the infection of skin lesions caused by shearing, castration, or docking [ [13](#B13-toxins-11-00525)]. C. chauvoei can be found in the environment in the form of spores, which persist in soils, pastures, manure, and perished animals [ [194](#B194-toxins-11-00525)]. When the animals ingest the spores, these are then transported to muscle tissue where they reside dormant until favorable anaerobic conditions facilitate their germination, such as muscle damage caused by blunt traumas or intramuscular injections [ [192](#B192-toxins-11-00525)]. C. chauvoei pathogenesis relies on the release of potent toxins that cause endogenous myonecrosis and edemic lesions, giving to the affected muscles the characteristic dark color from where blackleg takes its name [ [192](#B192-toxins-11-00525), [194](#B194-toxins-11-00525)]. The disease progresses rapidly, causing the death of the animal within 48 h of clinical manifestation [ [192](#B192-toxins-11-00525), [195](#B195-toxins-11-00525)]. On the other hand, C. chauvoei is not considered zoonotic, and only two fatal human cases have been reported [ [194](#B194-toxins-11-00525)]. [196](#B196-toxins-11-00525)]. Apart from minor variations in intergenic regions and flagellar genes, the metabolic, structural, and virulence-associated genes remain highly conserved among geographically different strains of C. chauvoei. This genomic stability suggests that it is a well-adapted and specialized pathogen that has reached a dead-end from an evolutional point of view [ [194](#B194-toxins-11-00525)]. However, from a molecular perspective, it is still not known how C. chauvoei orchestrates the spreading from the digestive tract to the skeletal muscles and pathogenesis. Several toxins and virulence factors have been described to contribute to cytolysis and hemolysis, causing the characteristic lesions of blackleg [ [192](#B192-toxins-11-00525)]. Among these, Clostridium chauvoei toxin A (CctA), a well-conserved toxin found in all the strains known across different continents, was identified as the major virulence factor [ [193](#B193-toxins-11-00525)]. CctA belongs to the -barrel pore-forming toxin of superfamily of bacterial is secreted extracellularly causing cell lysis by perforating the cell membrane and disrupting its permeability [ [192](#B192-toxins-11-00525), [197](#B197-toxins-11-00525)]. Other proteins, such as sialidase, beta toxin-DNAse, hemolysin, hyaluronidase, and flagella, are also important virulence factors associated with the spread and pathogenesis of C. chauvoei [ [192](#B192-toxins-11-00525), [198](#B198-toxins-11-00525), [199](#B199-toxins-11-00525)]. C. chauvoei Vaccine Production [195](#B195-toxins-11-00525)]. Nevertheless, although vaccination claims to be 100% effective against blackleg, the scientific evidence showing its efficacy in protecting cattle against C. chauvoei challenges is scant [ [200](#B200-toxins-11-00525)]. [201](#B201-toxins-11-00525)]. The complex medium contains casein hydrolysate, peptone, tryptone, yeast extract, and meat extract, plus L-cysteine hydrochloride, glucose, and salts [ [201](#B201-toxins-11-00525)]. Glucose excess has negative impacts on the antigenicity capacity of C. chauvoei cells, suggesting that carbon limitation is favorable for obtaining potent immunogenicity cultures [ [201](#B201-toxins-11-00525)]. [202](#B202-toxins-11-00525), [203](#B203-toxins-11-00525)]. However, the use supernatant containing other extracellular antigens apart from flagella also conferred protection in a mouse model [ [204](#B204-toxins-11-00525)]. Additionally, animals vaccinated with recombinant CctA developed high immunity against C. chauvoei challenges, making this toxin a valuable candidate for the design of a toxoid vaccine against blackleg [ [193](#B193-toxins-11-00525)]. 6. Clostridium septicum braxy in sheep and calves [ [13](#B13-toxins-11-00525), [206](#B206-toxins-11-00525)]. It is also responsible for causing malignant edema (gas gangrene) in ruminants [ [207](#B207-toxins-11-00525)] poultry [ [208](#B208-toxins-11-00525), [209](#B209-toxins-11-00525)]. However, other Clostridium species, such as C. sordellii, C. novyi type A, and C. perfringens type A, are also known to cause the latter animal diseases [ [207](#B207-toxins-11-00525), [208](#B208-toxins-11-00525), [210](#B210-toxins-11-00525)]. [211](#B211-toxins-11-00525), [212](#B212-toxins-11-00525), [213](#B213-toxins-11-00525), [214](#B214-toxins-11-00525)]. The disease rates than other clostridial infections [ [215](#B215-toxins-11-00525), [216](#B216-toxins-11-00525)], with death occurring in the first 24 h [ [217](#B217-toxins-11-00525)]. C. septicum lethality might be related to its higher virulence and aerotolerance compared to other Clostridium species that cause human myonecrosis [ [211](#B211-toxins-11-00525)]. As there are no prophylactic measures available to humans, treatment is based on antibiotic therapy [ [205](#B205-toxins-11-00525)] and surgical debridement [ [217](#B217-toxins-11-00525)]. [208](#B208-toxins-11-00525), [218](#B218-toxins-11-00525)]. Additionally, the current halt to the use of antibiotics as growth promoters could potentially increase the cases of clostridial dermatitis in poultry [ [209](#B209-toxins-11-00525)]. Malignant edema in livestock have been associated with the infection of wounds by C. septicum due to poor hygiene practices including vaccination, castration and dehorning as well as other medical and surgical procedures [ [13](#B13-toxins-11-00525), [219](#B219-toxins-11-00525), [220](#B220-toxins-11-00525)]. On the other hand, the ingestion of frozen pastures has been related to cases of braxy [ [12](#B12-toxins-11-00525)]. The portals of entry for C. septicum infection in poultry are still poorly characterized [ [221](#B221-toxins-11-00525)]. However, it is believed that infections can arise endogenously from gastric damage and exogenously through skin breaks [ [208](#B208-toxins-11-00525)]. [222](#B222-toxins-11-00525)], but its pathogenesis is principally mediated by the lethal alpha toxin (ATX) [ [223](#B223-toxins-11-00525)]. ATX is encoded by the csa gene and secreted as a prototoxin of 46 kDa, which undergoes proteolytic cleavage to form an active toxin of 43 kDa [ [224](#B224-toxins-11-00525)]. The pore-forming ATX causes cell oncosis [ [225](#B225-toxins-11-00525)] and it is structurally related to the aerolysin of Aeromonas hydrophila [ [226](#B226-toxins-11-00525)] and ETX of C. perfringens type B and D [ [224](#B224-toxins-11-00525)]. [196](#B196-toxins-11-00525)] and harbors a homologous agrD gene, which is known to regulate virulence in other pathogenic Clostridium [ [7](#B7-toxins-11-00525)]. However, molecular studies focusing on the regulation of ATX production are non-existent. C. septicum Vaccine Production [227](#B227-toxins-11-00525), [228](#B228-toxins-11-00525), [229](#B229-toxins-11-00525)]. Vaccines are produced by anaerobically growing C. septicum in a complex medium, such as meat peptones, and in literature in brain heart infusion, containing 0.3% glucose and 0.05% L-cysteine hydrochloride at 37 \u00b0C and pH between 7.2 and 7.4 for 18 to 24 h [ [227](#B227-toxins-11-00525), [228](#B228-toxins-11-00525), [230](#B230-toxins-11-00525)]. For the toxoid vaccine, ATX is harvested at the lowest point in redox potential, concentrated, purified, and inactivated in formalin 0.4% at 37 \u00b0C for 4 days [ [227](#B227-toxins-11-00525), [231](#B231-toxins-11-00525)]. Nutritional studies in C. septicum have shown that serine, lysine, nicotinamide, and thiamine are required for growth [ [232](#B232-toxins-11-00525)]. Nonetheless, at the large scale, ATX production is hampered by low biomass and low toxin titers [ [233](#B233-toxins-11-00525), [234](#B234-toxins-11-00525)]. Attempts to increase toxin yields have been successful in dialyzed cultures [ [233](#B233-toxins-11-00525)] and in glucose-limited batch fermentations with controlled pH [ [234](#B234-toxins-11-00525)], suggesting that carbon limitation favors toxin production. [235](#B235-toxins-11-00525)], making it a good candidate for further recombinant vaccine development. 7. Clostridium novyi [Table 1](#toxins-11-00525-t001)). C. novyi type A causes myonecrosis gangrene, malignant edema) in humans and animals [ [13](#B13-toxins-11-00525)], while type B principally causes infectious necrotic hepatitis (black disease) in ruminants, pigs, and horses [ [236](#B236-toxins-11-00525), [237](#B237-toxins-11-00525), [238](#B238-toxins-11-00525), [239](#B239-toxins-11-00525)]. Type B human infections are infrequent [ [240](#B240-toxins-11-00525), [241](#B241-toxins-11-00525)]. Conversely, type C is non-pathogenic [ [242](#B242-toxins-11-00525)]. [243](#B243-toxins-11-00525), [244](#B244-toxins-11-00525), [245](#B245-toxins-11-00525)]. Open wounds are the common portal of entry for C. novyi infections [ [246](#B246-toxins-11-00525)]. For instance, repeated injections with contaminated heroin lead to local-tissue ischemia and necrosis, creating a favorable environment for C. novyi spores to proliferate [ [244](#B244-toxins-11-00525)]. Other factors, such as immunosuppression, cancer, liver abscess, chemotherapy, or poorly controlled diabetes, might contribute to C. novyi propagation [ [240](#B240-toxins-11-00525), [241](#B241-toxins-11-00525), [247](#B247-toxins-11-00525)]. The mortality of C. novyi infections is high (~50%) [ [246](#B246-toxins-11-00525)] and treatment consists of intensive antibiotic therapy and aggressive surgical debridement [ [247](#B247-toxins-11-00525)]. At present, there are no commercially available vaccines to protect humans against C. novyi infections. [210](#B210-toxins-11-00525), [248](#B248-toxins-11-00525)], which results in massive edemas due to the toxin effect on vascular permeability, which is described in more detail in the C. perfringens section. However, C. novyi type A cases are less frequent than other infection of histotoxic clostridia [ [249](#B249-toxins-11-00525)], or are under-reported. Treatment of the disease is frequently not successful [ [210](#B210-toxins-11-00525), [250](#B250-toxins-11-00525)]. C. novyi type B causes black disease or infectious necrotic hepatitis, a well-documented disease in animals [ [236](#B236-toxins-11-00525)]. The ingestion of C. novyi spores tends to accumulate in distant organs, such as the liver, spleen, and bone marrow [ [20](#B20-toxins-11-00525)], without showing apparent symptoms. In ruminants, C. novyi outbreaks are caused by the migration of immature liver flukes, which damage the liver, creating suitable anaerobic conditions for spore germination, growth and toxin production [ [251](#B251-toxins-11-00525)]. Other low-grade infectious diseases, such as pneumonia or metritis in swine, can also trigger C. novyi spore germination and subsequent disease [ [237](#B237-toxins-11-00525)]. The rapid necrosis and toxemia lead to sudden death or death between 12-48 h, for which a successful therapy has not been described [ [20](#B20-toxins-11-00525), [237](#B237-toxins-11-00525)]. The darkening of the subcutaneous tissues and blackening of the carcasses after death are the hallmarks from which black disease takes its name [ [251](#B251-toxins-11-00525)]. [13](#B13-toxins-11-00525)]. However, pathogenesis of both C. novyi type A and B is principally mediated by the lethal and necrotizing alpha toxin (TcnA), which belongs to the family of large clostridial cytotoxins [ [252](#B252-toxins-11-00525)], along with toxin A and B of C. difficile and the lethal toxin of C. sordellii [ [253](#B253-toxins-11-00525)]. TcnA glycosyltransferase activity irreversibly modifies small GTP-binding proteins affecting the cell actin cytoskeleton, causing cell rounding and retraction [ [254](#B254-toxins-11-00525), [255](#B255-toxins-11-00525)]. Also, type B produces beta toxin, a phospholipase serologically identical to the beta toxin of C. hemolyticum but different from the phospholipases of C. novyi type A, C. perfringens type A, and C. bifermentans [ [256](#B256-toxins-11-00525)]. This toxin is further explained in the C. hemolyticum section below. [257](#B257-toxins-11-00525)]. This bacteriophage is believed to regulate toxin production and morphology [ [258](#B258-toxins-11-00525), [259](#B259-toxins-11-00525), [260](#B260-toxins-11-00525)]. Moreover, homologous genes or a novel C. perfringens toxin regulator (CPE1446-CPE1447) [ [261](#B261-toxins-11-00525)] and an AgrD quorum sensing peptide (Cno-19402) [ [7](#B7-toxins-11-00525)] are found Production [227](#B227-toxins-11-00525), [262](#B262-toxins-11-00525), [263](#B263-toxins-11-00525), [264](#B264-toxins-11-00525)] and humans [ [263](#B263-toxins-11-00525)]. However, human vaccines are not produced any more. Research on C. novyi culture optimization for toxin production dates back to the 1930s, with limited publication on this topic reported recently. [265](#B265-toxins-11-00525), [266](#B266-toxins-11-00525)]. The presence of sugars in the fermentation medium was firstly reported to negatively affect toxin titers [ [265](#B265-toxins-11-00525)]. However, it was later shown that the addition of sugars was indispensable for toxin production [ [267](#B267-toxins-11-00525)]. C. novyi type A can ferment glucose, dextrin, and maltose, while type B strains can ferment glucose, inositol, maltose, and mannose [ [268](#B268-toxins-11-00525)]. The use of particles, 3% peptone, 0.5% phosphate, and 1% maltose in meat infusion broth showed higher toxin production than previously reported media [ [267](#B267-toxins-11-00525)]. Likewise, alternative fermentation methods, such as dialysis flasks containing brain heart infusion with 0.75% Tween 80 and 2% glycerol, also produced high toxin titers [ [269](#B269-toxins-11-00525)]. C. novyi is grown for 18 to 72 h at 37 \u00b0C and inactivation of TcnA is achieved by incubation with 0.4% formalin at 37 \u00b0C for three days [ [227](#B227-toxins-11-00525)]. A more recent study showed that modeling the difficult C. novyi fermentation process using computational tools allowed optimization of toxin productivity, cell density, and fermentation time [ [260](#B260-toxins-11-00525)]. 8. Clostridium hemolyticum [270](#B270-toxins-11-00525), [271](#B271-toxins-11-00525), [ [274](#B274-toxins-11-00525), [275](#B275-toxins-11-00525)]. BH is common during dry seasons and in cattle that graze in pastures infested with liver flukes [ [276](#B276-toxins-11-00525)]. Similar to C. novyi, the ingested spores of C. hemolyticum are absorbed by the intestine and transported to the liver where they reside without causing disease. The migration of immature liver flukes causes local damage and anaerobiosis, which prompts C. hemolyticum germination and pathogenesis [ [270](#B270-toxins-11-00525)]. BH is characterized by severe hemolytic anemia with clinical symptoms (hemoglobinuria, jaundice, and fever) that frequently last for 10 to 12 h and rarely more than 3-4 days [ [276](#B276-toxins-11-00525), [277](#B277-toxins-11-00525)]. The sudden death of animals without clinical signs is also common [ [272](#B272-toxins-11-00525)]. The lethality of C. hemolyticum infections can reach 80% to 100% [ [276](#B276-toxins-11-00525)]. Some reports have shown recovery by using antibiotic therapy [ [278](#B278-toxins-11-00525), [279](#B279-toxins-11-00525)]; however, due to the rapid evolution of the disease, fatal cases are more common. [13](#B13-toxins-11-00525), [256](#B256-toxins-11-00525)]. However, C. hemolyticum produces more beta toxin than C. novyi type B [ [280](#B280-toxins-11-00525), [281](#B281-toxins-11-00525)]. The toxin provokes hepatocytes and erythrocytes destruction by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine into phosphocholine Production [276](#B276-toxins-11-00525), [277](#B277-toxins-11-00525)]. Studies on different media showed that high toxin titers were obtained in media consisting of sodium thioglycollate [ [282](#B282-toxins-11-00525)]. Higher toxin titers were obtained after 18 h of growth at 37 \u00b0C in dialysis cultures than in batch fermentations [ [282](#B282-toxins-11-00525)]. However, current bacterins do not induce a measurable amount of antitoxin titers, and frequent vaccination is required to assure protection against the disease [ [277](#B277-toxins-11-00525)]. It has been shown that the inactivation of the beta toxin with formaldehyde destroys the immunogenicity of the toxin, but the addition of glycine seems to stabilize the denaturation process, resulting in immunogenic toxoids [ [276](#B276-toxins-11-00525)]. On the other hand, vaccination with crude formalinized recombinant beta toxin has shown a protective effect in guinea pigs [ [277](#B277-toxins-11-00525)]. 9. Concluding Remarks [283](#B283-toxins-11-00525)]. The development of glycoconjugate vaccines consisting of a polysaccharide (e.g., cell-surface protein) covalently linked to a carrier protein, studied in detail in C. difficile, represent potential candidate vaccines to fight C. difficile invasion and colonization [ [284](#B284-toxins-11-00525), [285](#B285-toxins-11-00525)]. However, not all pathogenic Clostridium species are invasive, therefore further studies should be conducted to understand host-pathogen interactions in other Clostridium species. Other vaccination strategies, such as mucosal immunization, offer many advantages over traditional vaccination [ [286](#B286-toxins-11-00525)]. Intranasal vaccines consisting of BoNT/A toxoid with an adjuvant [287](#B287-toxins-11-00525)], BoNT-Hc/A, or tetanus toxoid administered using cCHP nanogel [ [288](#B288-toxins-11-00525)], have proven to elicit protective immunity in mice. On the other hand, recombinant vaccines offer greater purity of the final product and some recombinant toxins (e.g., subunits) do not need inactivation steps, shortening the production process and preventing residual formaldehyde in the final vaccine preparation.
