PediatricsDepartment of Pediatrics1 Introduction from the Chair I am excited to share with you our Department of Pediatrics biennial report for 2020 and 2021. This report details departmental activities in clinical care, education, and research. Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020, much of our time and energy has been spent in managing our response. Our faculty members, residents, and fellows have been remarkable during this unprecedented challenge. Along with our Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital colleagues, we have developed novel clinical pathways, new ways of rounding, and new communications channels with families, patients, and each other. We have become adept at donning and doffing of personal protective equipment, and learned the ins and outs of N95 masks and the like. We have updated curricula, developed on-line learning for trainees, colleagues, and the public, developed virtual grand rounds, and become facile at virtual clinic appointments. Research has led to rapid improvement in prevention and detection of SARS-CoV-2. Pediatrics faculty members have become leaders in preventing, detecting, and treating COVID and its complications at Upstate, in Central New York, and beyond. We have become a trusted source of information regarding the pandemic. We have also become adept at recognizing and managing some of the challenges associated with the pandemic, such as closed hospital beds, challenges to nursing staffing, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and the related epidemic of mental health challenges among children and adolescents. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, our work beyond COVID has continued. We continue to add faculty and grow pediatric programs. Melanie Comito, MD, Director of the Division of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, was appointed the first Paige Yeomans Arnold Endowed Professor in Pediatric Oncology in October, 2021, with funding donated by Paige's Butterfly Run. Based on our quality and safety work, Solutions for Patient Safety named Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital the \"Hospital of the Month\" for July, 2021. Although many professional meetings have been canceled, postponed, or made virtual, department members have continued to earn honors and produce scholarly work at an extraordinary pace, demonstrated by the extensive listings of awards, grants, publications, and more in this report. Of course, we do not work alone. We appreciate our many collaborators, including community physician partners, colleagues at Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital and University Hospital, and our teaching colleagues at Upstate Community Hospital, Crouse Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital, and at the Binghamton Clinical Campus. The Upstate Foundation and the Upstate Alumni Foundation provide wonderful programmatic, staff, and educational support. We welcome and value your feedback. You can keep up with our programs through our website: http://www.upstate.edu/gch. Thank you for all you do to support our mission to help children and families! Gregory P. Conners, MD, MPH, MBA, FAAP, FACEP Stanley A. August Professor and Chair of Pediatrics Executive Director, Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital Biennial Report 2020-20212 Department Leadership Our vice chairs have primary responsibilities for a variety of functions within the department. This group meets regularly with the Chair, and together acts as a deliberative body to set policy and direction. Each also makes independent decisions within his or her area of responsibility. Ann Botash, MD (botasha@upstate.edu) is Vice Chair for Educational Affairs, with responsibility for all aspects of education in the department: undergraduate, graduate, and continuing. This impressive scope of our education services is outlined in this report. Ann has also served Upstate in several leadership roles, including previously as Interim Chair of Pediatrics, and currently as Senior Associate Dean and Distinguished Education Professor. She is also Director of our Division of Child Abuse Pediatrics. Ann is a well-known figure in pediatrics nationally. She has received the Advocacy Award from the Ambulatory Pediatrics Association, is past-president of the Helfer Society, and is a child abuse pediatrician. Scott Schurman, MD (schurmas@upstate.edu) continues to serve as our Vice Chair for Clinical Affairs. Scott also directs our highly-regarded and growing program in kidney diseases, as Director of our Pediatric Nephrology Division. In his Vice Chair role, Scott has ultimate responsibility for clinical activity in the department. He has played an important role in our recent growth in faculty and programs. As we have grown and expanded into new ambulatory areas, Scott has overseen these as medical director. SUNY Distinguished Service Professor Leonard Weiner, MD (weinerl@upstate. edu) rounds out the department leadership team as Vice Chair for Academic Affairs. A former interim chair of our department, with a national reputation for clinical care and research in infectious diseases, Len is well suited for this role. Len has overall responsibility for our research programs, as is shown in our large number of publications and presentations. He is also the long-time Director of our Division of Pediatric Immunology and Infectious Disease. The leadership team is supported by department office manager Cherlynn Clarry (who retired March, 2022), assistant to the chair Gina Romero Colombo (romerog@upstate.edu) , and business manager Farrah McMahon (McMahonF@upstate.edu). Department of Pediatrics3 Pediatrics by the Numbers A few pertinent metrics provide a summary of our child health care activity during 2020-2021. Of course, all of these numbers were markedly affected by the challenges of the COVID pandemic.

The one above is at the entrance of Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital.Biennial Report 2020-20214 From the Pediatrics Diversity Committee The Department of Pediatrics has an active Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Committee focused on promoting a sense of belonging and respect for all faculty, residents, and staff, currently led by Olamide Ajagbe, MD and Karen Teelin, MD, MSEd . The committee is open to all, and is currently made of up 12 faculty members, 4 residents, and 6 non-physician colleagues. Consistent with the vision of SUNY Upstate Medical University, we support a culture of openness, humility, and learning. We review recruitment policies, the departmental mission statement, and educational programs for faculty and residents, to ensure that we support and foster a culture of respect for all, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender orientation, national origin, disability status, or socio-economic status. Examples of DEI initiatives within the department include: A bias checklist for all curricular materials for use when developing educational materials, developed by one of our faculty members, Amy Caruso Brown, MD, MSc, MSCS . See the checklist here: https://redcap.upstate.edu/surveys/?s=KADLRXK8WE A Community Pediatrics and Advocacy course for interns, led by Travis Hobart, MD, MPH and others, as well as an advocacy interest group, led by Winter Berry, DO including a trip to the state capitol as part of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Advocacy Day. A workshop for residents and faculty, developed by pediatric faculty, led by Dr. Olamide Ajagbe and presented nationally. \"Teaching Residents to Mitigate Prejudice\" teaches strategies and offers opportunities to practice interventions when prejudice is witnessed. All Grand Rounds speakers are asked to include DEI as aspect of their talk. At least one Grand Rounds per year is specifically focused on a DEI topic. Recent topics include disparities and access challenges related to children's mental health with a focus on the emergency medicine setting, and holistic health for children in the foster care system. Third year residents have the unique opportunity to provide primary care to Native American children one morning per month at the Onondaga Nation Clinic. Several programs within the division of General Pediatrics address the needs of underserved populations, including a clinic specialized for primary care for children in foster care in Onondaga County, led by Steven Blatt, MD with Jan Bach, MD as well as a \"diaper bank,\" led by Winter Berry, DO . A refugee clinic, led b y Andrea Shaw, MD curre ntly serving over 1400 refugee patients and families from Somalia, Congo, Syria, Afghanistan, and other countries. We have partnered with the Obama Children's Hospital in Kenya, where residents and faculty may rotate for clinical experiences and research. (Last trip February 2020.) We share monthly interdisciplinary case conferences with students and faculty colleagues in Kenya. Nienke Dosa MD, MPH of th e Golisano Center for Special Needs leads partnerships with community- based initiatives focused on adaptive technology, inclusive recreation and adapted sports for children with developmental disabilities. AT Village (ATVillage.org) is a quality improvement initiative provided by the Golisano Center for Special Needs that seeks to improve families' experience with the Durable Medical Equipment (DME) process, to promote interprofessional collaboration and to develop community standards for timely delivery of DME for children with developmental disabilities. Department of Pediatrics5 Our gender clinic, led by Dr. Karen Teelin , serves over 400 transgender youth from throughout the state, providing specialized medical care in an affirming, developmentally appropriate setting. Dr. Teelin has presented regionally and nationally, teaching primary care providers to care for transgender adolescents. We host a TransParent and a TransYouth group at the Golisano Children's Hospital, supporting families of transgender children. Significant faculty involvement in the undergraduate medical school course focused on DEI topics, Patients to Populations, led by Pediatrics Department faculty members Dr. Amy Caruso Brown and Dr. Travis Hobart , with seven other faculty from the department serving as group leaders.

The team works closely with residents, chief residents, students and other faculty to ensure attention to the educational needs of our learners. Learners include students, residents, fellows, faculty and staff. Graduate Medical Education For 85 years, the Department of Pediatrics has maintained a residency training program in general pediatrics that provides residents with a strong foundation in primary care pediatrics, acute care medicine and all subspecialties. Our collegial environment allows a \"hands on\" approach with a low faculty to resident ratio. Due to the large catchment area served by the department, residents directly care for patients with a vast array of medical problems. Residents are actively involved in varied learning experiences such as resident run journal clubs, research and pathophysiology conferences, case-based ambulatory care and subspecialty conferences, daily rounds with faculty, weekly grand rounds, and regular discourse with visiting professors. Our curriculum has prepared residents for fellowship training in subspecialties and careers in primary care pediatrics across the country. The residency program has received continued accreditation from the ACGME for 85 years and counting. The Residency Curriculum The curriculum enables residents to become competent in all areas of Pediatrics. Some highlights of the curriculum include: Didactics: The core didactic curriculum for residents offers an innovative approach to learning. Residents participate in a case-based teaching by expert faculty teachers. The curriculum covers all of the domains represented in the American Board of Pediatrics content outline for the General Pediatrics Certification Exam. Primary Care: Training in outpatient general pediatrics is based at the Upstate Pediatric and Adolescent Center (UPAC). Residents also have the option of participating in a longitudinal outpatient clinical experience at the Onondaga Nation Clinic during their third year. Residents also maintain their own unique patient panels as part of continuity clinic, which is also based at UPAC. In the third-year residents can seek out additional opportunities in private practices in the community to enhance their training and education. Critical Care: Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) is the setting for training in Pediatric Critical Care Medicine. Residents provide direct patient care for the sickest children in Central New York, who are admitted with a wide-range of conditions. Emergency Medicine: Residents serve on the front line to care for children up to 19 years of age who come with medical or surgical emergencies to the area's only Pediatric Emergency Department. The department conducts over 25,000 visits annually. Residents are supervised by board certified Pediatric Emergency Medicine faculty. Developmental Pediatrics: This rotation takes advantage of the outstanding community resources in child development, as well as those at our newly opened Golisano Center for Special Needs. The Biennial Report 2020-20218 Center is home to services for children with developmental and behavioral problems, including the autistic spectrum disorders, as well as those with complex medical conditions, such as spina bifida, cerebral palsy, and genetic disorders. Inpatient: Dedicated pediatric hospitalists provide oversight and direct care for the inpatients at the Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital. They also provide consultative care to other medical and surgical patients. Hospitalists also serve as educators for residents and medical students on their inpatient rotations. Trainees participate in family centered rounds with attendings, mid-level providers, nurses, and other staff. Subspecialties: The training program provides comprehensive experiences in the pediatric subspecialties. Residents have elective time that allows them to explore different specialty areas to deepen their knowledge and consider opportunities for fellowships. Residents have one call-free block during residency that they can use for away rotations elsewhere in the United States or overseas with the Global Health program. Summer Advocacy Series: This intern-only conference series introduces new trainees to community pediatrics and advocacy in the context of our local setting. These didactic sessions cover topics including early childhood literacy, environmental health, and legislative advocacy and concludes with a narrated bus tour of the city. Teaching Skills for House Staff: This quarterly series has been offered for over 20 years and is designed to meet the needs of residents as teachers. The series addresses topics including delivering effective lectures, teaching at the bedside, providing feedback, evaluating students and serving as a role model. Residents also have an option of an elective in teaching skills. Club Med (Resident-run Journal Club): Senior residents present interactive sessions designed to analyze recent literature and demonstrate possible effects on practice. Global Health: Residents and students can participate in international health activities during their third year of training. We have a partnership with Obama Children's Hospital in Kisumu, Kenya, where our residents interact with trainees and provide bedside and didactic teaching while they learn about providing care in resource-limited settings. Residents provide care for refugee patients locally in nearly all of their clinical rotations. Research: Many of our residents participate in active research with faculty. Residents are encouraged to write up clinical cases for publication and many manuscripts reported throughout this document were authored or co-authored by our residents and students. Primary Care Skills Rotation and Career Pathways: All interns rotate through Primary Care Skills (PCS), which serves as the first of the six career pathway rotations. PCS is a rotation designed for interns to gain new knowledge and skills in the areas of advocacy, global health, and research. It combines both in-person and virtual learning experiences to serve this goal. At the end of the intern year residents select from one of three career pathways designed to give residents more time to practice and enhance skills in the areas of advocacy, global health, and research. Residents meet with a pathway advisor to determine which rotations will best fit their personal career goals. Quality Improvement: The Division for Quality Improvement provides four hours of patient safety/ quality improvement didactics annually. Residents obtain a Basic Certificate in Quality and Safety from the IHI Open School during their intern year. All residents complete a quality improvement project prior to graduation. Residents receive mentorship from dedicated quality improvement faculty to help with their projects, with most completing projects of their own design in teams. Some go on to have their projects presented externally. Eligible projects are awarded part 4 Maintenance of Certification (MOC) credit by the American Board of Pediatrics. Department of Pediatrics9 Morbidity and Mortality (M&M): All third-year residents prepare and present an event review for M&M at departmental grand rounds. Residents have a timeline for their case analysis using quality and safety tools. They benefit from expert faculty mentorship and interdisciplinary collaboration. Presentations include a description of recommendations to improve processes and have a positive impact on systems. In the first 2 years after designing M&M in 2019 we have had 28 conferences yielding 61 recommended systems improvements, of which 20 have been implemented thus far. Resident Teaching Awards: Residents are recognized by the department on an annual basis through clerkship student identification of exemplary resident teachers. These are awarded each year at the resident graduation ceremony held in June. Undergraduate Medical Education Pediatrics Clerkship: Our 5-week clerkship provides pediatric education to approximately 170 third year medical students every year. Students are assigned to either the Syracuse or Binghamton clinical campus. At both locations, students participate in outpatient and inpatient direct patient care experiences. In Syracuse, medical students rotate on the inpatient hospital medicine service teams and work closely with pediatric residents and hospital medicine attendings. Students rotate at general pediatric outpatient offices either at the Upstate main campus or in the community. Some students also have pediatric outpatient subspecialty experiences built into their schedules. All students participate in newborn medicine clinical experiences at Upstate or other hospitals in our community. The clerkship objectives include six domains - Patient Care, Medical Knowledge, Interpersonal Communication Skills, Practice Based Learning, Systems Based Practice and Professionalism. Students actively participate in direct patient care, teaching rounds/discussions about patients, and interactive small group learning sessions or conferences (examples include adolescent medicine case discussions and pediatric history and physical examination skill sessions). Students give evidence-based medicine (EBM) presentations on focused clinical questions that arise during their care of patients. Faculty within the Department of Pediatrics serve as EBM small group discussion facilitators evaluating student presentations. Students write reflective narratives regarding professionalism and systems-based practice issues (topics include systemic/institutional bias and health equity). Faculty members, including the Chair of Pediatrics and Vice Chair for Educational Affairs, review and select narratives for discussion. Faculty facilitators and students from both clinical campuses subsequently join each other to participate in small group discussions. Docs for Tots: Students in the first and second year of medical school participate in a pediatric club offering seminars, mentoring, physical examination skills rounds and advocacy/fund raising events for children. This program generally includes 25-40 students. Pediatric Electives are offered in all specialties, including \"unique\" electives and concurrent electives. MS4 Advising : Students planning additional education and/or careers in pediatrics have many opportunities for electives, research and scholarship, and acting internships. Matthew Mittiga, DO and Gloria Kennedy, MD work closely with students to provide individual specialty guidance and support. Recognition/Awards Faculty : Several Pediatrics faculty members were honored with 2020 Exceptional teacher recognition for their contributions to the Pediatrics clerkship program: Leah Bennett, MD, MPH, Joshua Bonville, MD, Robert Dracker, MD, Nate Meuser-Herr, MD, Matthew Mittiga, DO, Matthew O'Connor, MD, Jaclyn Sisskind, MD, Brian Tran, DO, and Prateek Wali, MD .

One Grand Rounds per month is dedicated to a morbidity and mortality case. Yearly special events include funded, visiting professorships provided by nationally recognized invited speakers. Part 2 ABP MOC: Evaluating Child Sexual Abuse, an interactive educational activity for the practitioner about child sexual abuse examination and treatment, was developed by Ann Botash, MD and provides 20 Part 2 MOC credits. American Board of Pediatrics MOC Portfolio Program: A committee of faculty is entrusted with evaluating quality improvement projects on behalf of the American Board of Pediatrics for MOC Part 4 credit. Since initiation in 2019, we have approved 9 separate quality improvement projects put forth by our residents and faculty, and have been approved for a 2-year program renewal. Pediatric Hematology/Oncology: Provides weekly sessions which consist of a multidisciplinary Pediatric Tumor Board, Hematology Case Conference, and a Vascular Anomalies Tumor Board with CME credit available. Educational Outcomes Graduates of our residency program go on to careers in primary care practice and in academic medicine, in the subspecialties and in general pediatrics. Roughly half of our residents pursue subspecialty training in a variety of clinical domains. Our residents have joined outpatient primary care practices or academic departments in the Syracuse area as well as various communities in New York State, across the United States, and internationally. We recruit 1-3 chief residents per year from the graduating class and from other programs. Our pass rate for the American Board of Pediatrics General Pediatrics Certifying Examination for first-time test takers is over 70% for the last five years. On the NBME subject exam in Pediatrics, taken by medical students completing their Pediatrics clerkship experience, students scored above the national mean for those taking a 5-week rotation. Department of Pediatrics11 Pediatric Resident Research All pediatric residents participate in one or more research / quality improvement projects with faculty prior to graduation. Residents benefit from mentorship from a variety of areas to complete their projects. In addition to their quality improvement work, residents undertake other research projects, ranging from case reports to education. From 2020 to 2021, 16 resident abstracts were selected for presentation as posters or platform presentations at regional and national meetings. Rohan Akhouri, MD, MPH was selected for the AMSPDC 2020 Frontiers in Science Symposium.

The CARE team consists of two American Board of Pediatrics-certified Child Abuse Pediatricians, and specially trained nurse practitioners, nurses, and social workers, who work together in managing suspected child and adolescent victims of maltreatment. Medical care and treatment are provided for children 21 years of age or younger in a sensitive, supportive, and reassuring environment. In 2020, the Child Abuse Pediatrics consult service was expanded to include an inpatient service to better serve inpatient needs. This has been a highly successful service in terms of ensuring appropriate medical evaluations, communication with investigative agencies and safety plans. Educational Highlights Since 2018, the Division of Child Abuse Pediatrics has supported an ACGME accredited Child Abuse Pediatrics Fellowship, which is a collaboration between Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital at SUNY Upstate Medical University and the McMahon Ryan Child Advocacy Center (CAC). This unique training program provides opportunities for a broad clinical experience as well as robust opportunities for research and scholarly activities. Fellows are part of the CAC's multidisciplinary team. The CAC integrates advocacy, prevention, investigation, prosecution, and treatment services for cases involving all aspects of physical abuse, sexual abuse, human trafficking, and other forms of child maltreatment. The CAC coordinates Onondaga County's Child Fatality Review Team. Fellows have had the opportunity to provide culturally sensitive general pediatric care in a longitudinal experience at the Onondaga Nation Health Center, an outpatient health care clinic on the Onondaga Nation, or at University Pediatric and Adolescent Center (UPAC). Educational content is covered through a variety of conferences and didactics, including quarterly journal clubs, lunch and learns, educational Department of Pediatrics13 webcasts, weekly case rounds, and an annual conference. Fellows also earn a Certificate in Advanced Study in Public Health. The Division manages the Child Abuse Medical Provider Program (CHAMP), funded through the New York State Department of Health. CHAMP improves New York State's medical response to child abuse. Weekly case conferences with NYS CAPs, educational webcasts, on-line courses and practice recommendations are produced through this program to support medical providers in the field. http://champprogram.com The Division offers electives for medical students, pediatric and family practice residents, and fellows from other specialties (including Emergency Medicine and Child & Adolescent Psychiatry). Our elective is highly sought after. Drs. Ann Botash and Alicia Pekarsky are Upstate Medical University Learning Community clinical advisors for all four years of medical students. Research Highlights This past year, the Division participated in a research pilot study on Saliva microRNA signatures in children with moderate-to-severe brain injury in collaboration with investigators at Penn State University, the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, and the Upstate Departments of Surgery and Neurosurgery. Fellows: Dr. Ashraf completed her quality improvement study on follow up skeletal surveys and has a manuscript in preparation. Drs. Ashraf, Botash, and Pekarsky, and several collaborators updated the online CHAMP Skeletal Survey recommendations. Dr. Ross is interested in factors impacting the length of hospital stay in abused children and has implemented a study. She is seeking funding to support scene investigation for investigative agencies in cases of suspected maltreatment. Dr. Pekarsky was selected for, and is serving as a guest editor for a special edition of The Quarterly , a journal of reviews for recent peer-reviewed medical literature on the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect. Dr. Pekarsky was the site Principal Investigator for a research network [Examining Siblings to Recognize Abuse (ExSTRA) investigators] that continues to publish manuscripts. She has been a contributor for two peer-reviewed articles. Dr. Botash is developing new CHAMP material to address racism and bias in child abuse investigations, management and treatment and co-authored a Pediatrics publication on this topic. Division Highlights The Division of Child Abuse Pediatrics was officially formed in 2020. In the Fall of 2020, Dr. Pekarsky relaunched the Inpatient Child Abuse Pediatrics consult service after a 10-year hiatus. As Director of this service, Dr. Pekarsky worked with hospital medical services and community agencies to assess their specific needs, developed a service to meet those needs, and addressed staffing/scheduling issues. During the first 12 months of the service, the team evaluated approximately 150 hospitalized children who were suspected to have been abused. Due to this demand, we expanded our NP support from Nancy Mitchell, PNP (who has worked with the program for over 30 years) to add Kristin Razawich, PNP as a full-time team member. Dr. Botash instituted the CAP Fellowship and was the CAP Fellowship inaugural Program Director. In 2020, Dr. Pekarsky assumed this role. Dr. Ashraf graduated in 2021, and is developing a program as full time Child Abuse Pediatrician in Buffalo, NY. The fellows, along with both faculty members, presented at the Helfer Society Meeting in April 2021.

In addition to serving the greater Syracuse area, we also provide care to 17 surrounding counties in Central New York. Our program is the regional sickle cell center as well as the regional hemophilia and bleeding disorders treatment center. Consultative services are available immediately for primary care physicians. Outpatient care is provided in the Waters Center for Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders located in the Upstate Cancer Center which opened in 2014. The clinic is located on the third floor in a space designed for children. The Outpatient Infusion Center is also located in this facility and serves all pediatric subspecialty patients. The physicians of the division are readily available to care for any infusion-related reactions for all children in the Center. A pediatric nurse practitioner is onsite and helps in the supervision of the care of the other subspecialty infusion patients. Inpatient care is provided in a dedicated unit in the Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital. This unit and its nursing staff provides care for children receiving care for cancer and blood disorders. We also provide care for children undergoing autologous stem cell transplants, immunotherapy, and other biotherapy treatments. Consultative services are available throughout Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital and is also available to the infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Crouse Hospital. The Center for Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders is an active member of the Children's Oncology Group (COG). COG is an international clinical trials group supported by the National Cancer Institute and is the world's largest organization devoted exclusively to pediatric cancer research. This allows us to provide the most current therapy while keeping the children and their parents close to the support of family and friends at home. These trials include frontline treatment for many types of childhood cancers, studies aimed at determining the underlying biology of these diseases, and trials involving new and emerging treatments, supportive care, and survivorship. Our participation in the COG also allows us to contribute to the steady improvement in therapies that is now allowing nearly Department of Pediatrics31 80% of children diagnosed with cancer to survive. Our pediatric hematology/oncology program is committed to quality which is measured by our commitment to best practices, outcomes, and our ability to prevent infections. A formal chemotherapy safety program has been implemented to aid in the establishment of standardized procedures and event tracking. We hold multidisciplinary pediatric tumor boards that meet twice monthly to discuss our patients in active treatment. Ongoing quality projects include measurement of time to antibiotics for patients with febrile neutropenia, tracking of seasonal influenza vaccination rates for our active chemotherapy and sickle cell patients and working with our Children's Hospital Safety team on the tracking of our central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) rates in the pediatric oncology/SCT population. The Dubowy Brain Tumor Center is a multidisciplinary neuro-oncology program. The center is directed by Dr. Gloria Kennedy . The focus of the center is a dedicated clinic that is focused on the pediatric brain tumor survivor with support from the educational specialist, family therapist, and social worker. There is additional support for patients from close collaborations with pediatric neurology, pediatric neurosurgery, radiation oncology, and pediatric endocrinology. The visits focus not only on the medical care and management of long-term complications but also on the psychosocial and educational needs of these unique and rapidly growing group of patients. It has been well recognized that the management of children with pediatric brain and spinal cord tumors is complex and requires a special multidisciplinary team. With the addition of Dr. Melanie Comito, who brings 16 years of experience in pediatric neuro-oncology, the mission has been expanded to treat all pediatric neuro-oncology patients in the context of a specialized program. Our Comprehensive Sickle Cell Treatment Program is a state-designated center providing care to children and adolescents with sickle cell disease.

Dr. Nead serves as the Clerkship Director and has developed a project involving peer assessments of oral presentations. The faculty is also responsible for teaching the fourth-year medical students, on their Inpatient Pediatric Acting Internship, a rotation for most medical students who go on to pursue Pediatric residencies and some with interests in Family Medicine. All three years of Pediatric residents have required rotations on the Inpatient Service. The faculty provides the inpatient education and evaluation of each of the residents. Residents have also opted to take additional Hospital Medicine electives to hone their skills in the care of pediatric inpatients. Dr. Ajagbe serves as an Associate Program Director for the Residency Program. Family Medicine residents also rotate onto the Hospital Medicine Service. We currently are teaching residents from 3 Family Medicine residency programs, including residents in their first, second and third years of residency. In July of 2022 we will welcome our first Pediatric Hospital Medicine Fellow. This 2-year fellowship program has been accredited by the ACGME and is led by Dr. Myszewski , the Program Director and Dr. Zaman, the Associate Program Director. Graduating fellows with be eligible to sit for the ABP certifying exam in Pediatric Hospital Medicine. Dr. Myszewski works with the PHM Fellowship Director's Council's Faculty Development Subcommittee. Under the guidance of Dr. Zaman and collaboratively with nursing, palliative care, child life specialists and residents, the division is working to review and update the LEAPP program: Listen, Evaluate, Anticipate, Plan and Proceed, an approach to preparing for procedures on pediatric inpatients. This involves an educational program for staff and families to better address pain, especially around procedures, including a new order set for pain medications. Division faculty present lectures to the residents in their Thursday Morning Conference series, present at department Grand Rounds, and regularly participate and present in the Monthly Morbidity and Mortality Conferences. This Morbidity and Mortality Conference is organized and led by Dr. Melissa Schafer , one of the faculty in the division. Dr. Schafer also provides education to the residents throughout the year with a series of lectures about quality improvement.

Dr. Melissa Schafer is involved in multiple QI research projects and presentations, including projects that improve pediatric sepsis outcomes, influenza hesitancy, bronchiolitis management, and education around QI. See more in the Quality and Safety section. Division Highlights Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the division has worked to keep up with the current information on the pandemic. We have established collaborative working groups with faculty from Critical Care, Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Cardiology, Rheumatology, nursing and Department of Pediatrics37 respiratory therapy in order to develop care pathways to manage acute COVID-19 infection and MIS-C. The division expanded the age of patients for whom we provide care up to age 30 years during the Delta Variant COVID-19 surge. The Pediatric Hospital Medicine division continues to develop pathways for other diagnoses. Bronchiolitis is a common diagnosis requiring hospital admission. The division has developed a working group including faculty from the ED and PICU, along with nursing and respiratory therapy to develop and oversee a pathway for this disease. This process has allowed us to bring High Flow Nasal Canula for this diagnosis to the general inpatient units. This group is currently developing a care pathway for asthma. Our division participates in Solutions for Patient Safety, a patient safety network of Children's Hospitals across the US and Canada addressing a number of hospital-acquired conditions. We were named the Solutions for Patient Safety Hospital of the Month for July 2021; where the hospital and safety team was honored for performance in preventing central line infections, preventing pressure injuries, and preventing unplanned extubations. The faculty have also joined an AAP Value In Pediatrics (VIP) project, Better Antibiotic Selection in Children. This is a national quality improvement project geared towards improving our antibiotic use in skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, and community acquired pneumonia. This multi-institutional collaboration has led to decreased antibiotic use and more selective antibiotic choices. At our hospital, this resulted in care pathways to stream line care of patients with these conditions. Another VIP project that the hospital medicine division is participating in is the REVISE II project (Reducing Variability in the Infant Sepsis Evaluation). Dr. Zaman, with one of our residents, Dr. Saber Jan, is leading a QI project regarding resident education around palliative care medications and pain in patients. The Hospital Medicine division has established a collaborative working relationship with the other PHM divisions in Upstate, NY, including Buffalo, Rochester, and Albany.

Weiner, MD, Distinguished Service Professor of Pediatrics, Pathology and Family Medicine, Division Director, Pediatric Infectious Disease Fellowship Program Director Joseph B. Domachowske, MD, Professor of Pediatrics, Microbiology and Immunology Jana Shaw, MD, MPH, MS, Professor of Pediatrics Manika Suryadevara, MD, Associate Professor of Pediatrics Fellow Danielle Daniels, MD: July 2020 to present Clinical Overview The Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases provides care for infants, children and adolescents with severe or unusual infections and immune deficiency syndromes, including HIV. Infectious disease specialists evaluate and treat children with recurrent infections, persistent or periodic fever syndromes, unusual or severe bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic diseases, and innate or acquired immune deficiency syndromes. As a designated New York State Department of Health Pediatric/Adolescent AIDS Center of Excellence, we provide medical care for pediatric and young adult patients infected with or exposed to human immunodeficiency virus. Our outpatient care is provided in the Pediatric and Adolescent Infectious Disease and Immunology Center in the pediatric subspecialty outpatient setting located in the Golisano Children's Hospital. Patients referred by their primary care physicians for infectious disease and immunologic diagnostic evaluations or who need intravenous antibiotics and immunoglobulin infusions are cared for in this Center. Follow-up evaluations on recently hospitalized patients also take place in this setting. Additionally, as a NYSDOH designated Newborn Referral Center for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIDS) screening, we provide immediate evaluations for those newborns with positive screens. Hospitalized patients are evaluated upon the request of their physicians at Golisano Children's Hospital and the Crouse NICU. Our infectious disease specialists work closely with primary care pediatricians, family physicians, surgical specialist, intensivists, hospitalists, and neonatologists to direct the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluations of patients with infectious disease and/or immunologic problems. The activities of the Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases include the only New York State Department of Health Pediatric Designated AIDS Center/Specialty Care Center in the region. This program has also received a Center of Excellence designation and is funded by the New York State Department of Health. The Division of Infectious Disease is also a NYSDOH-designated newborn screening center for evaluation of T-cell lymphopenia disorders/SCIDS and has received a Center of Excellence designation. The Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases also has oversight responsibilities for the Infection Control and Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs at Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital and for the inpatient control activities at the Crouse NICU. Educational Highlights The Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases has an accredited fellowship program that accommodates one postgraduate resident a year. The focus of this sub-specialty education is research and clinical care. The fellowship has a full five-year accreditation from the ACGME with no citations. Fellow Dr. Danielle Daniels was selected for the 2020 APS SPR Journeys & Frontiers in Pediatric Research program.Department of Pediatrics39 Research Highlights A major effort of the infectious disease physicians is direction and participation in multi-center, national and international clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new pharmacologic agents and vaccines for children and adolescents. Specifically, Dr. Leonard Weiner currently supervises protocols to evaluate novel antiviral therapies and multiple clinical vaccine trials. Dr. Joseph Domachowske's clinical research interests focus on the epidemiology, prevention and clinical manifestations of viral infections. Dr. Domachowske is the Director, Maternal-Child Pediatric Health for the institution's Global Health Program. Dr. Jana Shaw's clinical research interests focus on epidemiology, infection control, and vaccine policy. She has also undertaken studies aimed at elucidating the causes of vaccine refusal among various populations and to describe the epidemiology of vaccine hesitancy in the US. Dr. Manika Suryadevara's research interests include the study of vaccine preventable diseases, increasing vaccination rates by both improving access to vaccine and understanding and intervening with parental and provider vaccine hesitancy. She is also involved in clinical vaccine trials. Division Highlights The arrival of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in early 2020 resulted in a major re-focusing of the clinical and research activities of the Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases. Clinically, along with everyone else in the medical community, we had to learn how to manage patients with a completely new set of disease manifestations. Additionally, we worked to develop tools to define the new epidemiology of this burgeoning pathogen and to collaborate with others in the evaluation of effective vaccines and therapeutic modalities. To that end, the Division undertook large scale Pfizer and Moderna SARS-CoV-2 pediatric vaccine trials for ages 6-months to 18 years which are still in progress.

In 2019, Pediatric Outpatient Dialysis Units for peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis opened at UGCH. Other outpatient services are provided in our offices at 725 Irving Ave, Suite 805, directly across the street from UGCH. This office has been recognized for exemplary Patient Experience Performance, and Dr. Schurman received the 2019 Patient Experience Outstanding Performer Award. The section evaluates and treats infants, children, and adolescents with the full spectrum of disorders of the urinary tract. This activity includes basic nephrology disorders such as nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, all stages of chronic kidney disease, and inpatient and outpatient dialysis. The section is part of the University Hospital Transplant team, providing comprehensive kidney transplant services for children and adolescents; over the last decade our team has consistently performed the most pediatric kidney transplants in the Upstate New York region, with 100% 1, 3, and 5-year graft survival. This includes 46 transplants in 2021 alone. We have an established expertise in the evaluation and management of children with hypertension, including 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Metabolic evaluations of children with urolithiasis are performed, stressing dietary measures that can minimize risk of recurrence. The section provides coordinated care to infants and children with simple and complex urologic abnormalities, including prenatal visits. Patients with congenital or other hydronephrosis and vesicoureteral reflux are evaluated and followed. We work closely with our section of Pediatric Urology, including a bi-monthly combined case review. Educational Highlights Nephrology faculty are involved in a variety of educational activities. The pediatric residency lecture series, in which our faculty actively participate, provides the fundamental knowledge basis for recognizing and treating common kidney diseases. Residents often choose to spend a month with our team on elective; this time focuses on inpatient rounds and outpatient care, including general nephrology, dialysis, and transplant patients. Elective curriculum includes a series of didactic case discussions that focus on nephrology subjects pertinent to the general pediatric board examination. Research Highlights Dr. Heather Wasik's focus has been on using large databases to ask and answer questions related to End Stage Kidney Disease Care. This has included retrospective cohort studies using the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies database to evaluate dialysis and transplant outcomes in children with end stage kidney disease due to lupus nephritis and analysis of hospitalization costs of hemodialysis catheter-associated blood stream infections in children by Department of Pediatrics43 using data from the Standardizing Care to Improve Outcomes in Pediatric ESRD (SCOPE) Collaborative and the Pediatric Health Information System databases. Division Highlights The section is involved in Quality Improvement initiatives touching multiple areas of care. The Nephrotoxic Acute Kidney Injury (NAKI) is a program sponsored through the Solutions for Patient Safety. Our process for identifying patients admitted to the hospital and at-risk for medication induced renal injury, and communicating that information to care providers, was highlighted by the consortium. The Pediatric Nephrology Center at UGCH participates in the SCOPE Collaborative. A Quality Transformation Network, the SCOPE Collaborative of 50+ Pediatric Nephrology centers implements evidence-based catheter bundles aimed to reduce catheter related infection. The section coordinates Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) programs in chronic Pediatric Dialysis and Pediatric Kidney Transplantation, including projects to improve viral and rejection surveillance and hypertension management in transplant patients. From left to right, Richard Johnson (2nd place in his age division), Dr. Heather Wasik (1st place in the women's division) and Scott Corrigan (3rd place in his division) after participating in the Syracuse Walk/Run for Kidneys at Onondaga Lake Park, Liverpool, New York.The pediatric nephrology division at Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital provides outstanding clinical care to infants, children, and adolescents in the Central New York region with a broad range of kidney and related conditions. Our team includes dedicated board certified physicians, nurses, dieticians and social workers. Our division also collaborates with experts in pediatric urology, dialysis, and kidney transplantation to provide comprehensive care to our patients. In addition, we support our neonatal and pediatric intensive care units and local community physicians with consultations for both rare and complex as well as common conditions of the kidney and genitourinary tract Biennial Report 2020-202144 Pediatric Palliative Care Faculty Irene Cherrick, MD, Associate Professor of Pediatrics; Medical Director Nusrat Zaman, MD, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics Jill Majeski, PsyD , Clinical Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Licensed Pediatric Psychologist Clinical Overview The CHOICES Pediatric Palliative Care Program provides care from prior to birth (prenatal period) into adulthood for children and their families with complex and life-threatening medical conditions. Program Director Dr. Irene Cherrick is Board-Certified in Hospice & Palliative Care Medicine. All medical providers on the CHOICES team have completed a nationally recognized intensive Pediatric Pain Master Class. Pediatric Palliative Care provides an extra layer of support and various services to patients (and their families) that are cure-seeking, life-prolonging, comfort-enhancing to optimize quality of life. The CHOICES team provides care across the spectrum of life and is NOT limited to end of life or hospice care. This team provides care and support to children dealing with medically complex problems. This care is provided in the inpatient, outpatient as well as home setting based upon need. The CHOICES team partners with the patient's medical team as well as numerous community-based agencies to perform this complex care. The CHOICES team supports medical decision-making, providing timely and effective interventions to minimize suffering (pain and symptom management) while maximizing quality of life and managing and coordinating the logistics of care to provide seamless transitions between settings (thus optimizing patient and family continuity) to maintain the highest quality of care. Team members have collective expertise to address the physical, psychosocial, emotional, practical and spiritual needs of the child and family as a whole (including extended families and siblings in addition to patients and parents). This care includes bereavement care which includes anticipatory grief and continues after the death. Pediatric Palliative Care populations are very different from adult palliative care populations. Although adult palliative care teams often focus on improving quality of life for patients with terminal diseases, pediatric palliative care programs support children and families with chronic medical disease across the spectrum of many years. The CHOICES team provides the following: Establishes rapport with the patient/family/support system throughout a continuum incorporating complex medical conditions and care Explores and assists with defining and advocating for patient's/families' goals of care Expert pediatric pain and symptom management, including those with severe neurological impairment who often require a different level of expertise Assist with processing the impact of serious medical conditions/injuries for the patient/family and support network, and providing educational resources for coping, communication, decision making, and parenting in the face of a complex medical illness Support groups for caretakers of children with complex medical conditions as well as support group for bereaved family members Offers continuity of care throughout including specialists' appointments, hospitalizations, attending care conferences, and provides continuous support services among specialties and settings including Golisano Children's Hospital, Crouse NICU, perinatal center, home, provider provider's specialty clinics, outpatient and inpatient settings, and hospice servicesDepartment of Pediatrics45 Facilitates the processing of anticipatory grief, end-of-life care and bereavement support, and coordinates with local hospices providing pediatric expertise for those children nearing the end of their lives. Educational Highlights The faculty are involved in many educational activities including clinical teaching with nursing staff, housestaff, and medical students. There is an elective for pediatric housestaff in Pediatric Palliative Care which is tailored to their plans for the future whether this be specialty or primary care. These residents are encouraged to have this experience reinforce and present a unique time to enhance their communication skills with patients/ families. A similar elective is available to medical students. Dr. Cherrick has presented at the National/International, State and Local (including within the institution) on various topics within Pediatric Palliative Care including being a guest speaker. She is also involved in teaching of Palliative Care fellows at Rochester Regional Medical Center. The team members are also regular participants at National and International conferences within the field. Faculty Overview: Dr. Cherrick, as the medical director and founder of Pediatric Palliative Care at Upstate. She is board certified in Hospice and Palliative Care. She leads the CHOICES Pediatric Palliative Care team with particular interest in perinatal palliative care, particularly of genetic disorders such as Trisomy 13/18 as well as symptom management and care of the child with severe neurological impairment. Dr. Jill Majeski is a pediatric psychologist focused on providing psychological services with pediatric sickle cell disease and pediatric palliative care populations. Her primary interests are in optimizing quality-of-life for children living with serious and complex medical conditions, communication in the healthcare setting, medical decision-making, and psychosocial program development. She holds leadership positions with the Society of Pediatric Psychology and other professional groups with goals of further developing formal education and training opportunities for pediatric psychologists interested in specializing in pediatric palliative care. Dr. Nusrat Zaman is a Pediatric Hospitalist and the Associate Program Director for the PHM fellowship. Her interest in Pediatric Palliative Care stemmed from encountering hospitalized children with complex diagnoses and medical issues and recognizing the benefit of early pediatric palliative care intervention. Her primary interests are pain management, particularly improving comfort for hospitalized children during bedside procedures and emphasizing an interdisciplinary approach to chronic pain.

Hingre, MD, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics Christina Nicolais, PhD, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics Marium Yabe-Gill, MD, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics Clinical Overview The Division of Pulmonary, Asthma, and Sleep Medicine provides care for the full range of respiratory disorders and diseases in children and adolescents. The Cystic Fibrosis Center (Robert C. Schwartz Cystic Fibrosis Program) is accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. A team of physicians, a nutritionist, a social worker, cystic fibrosis (CF) care nurses, a CF Center coordinator, a pharmacy technician, a specialized CF pharmacist, and the CF Center psychologist strive to provide excellent care for children with CF. The Center has been the site for many of the landmark therapeutic trials sponsored by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Therapeutic Development Network (TDN). The Center's physical therapist led the US CF Physical Therapy annual meeting in 2019-2020, and he was asked in December 2021 to be the Physical Therapy Co-Representative on the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference Program Planning Committee. It is a tremendous honor to be a part of this program and organization to help move care for patients with CF forward. The Center has been repeatedly recognized by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for excellence in partnership with the Central New York chapter of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, most recently in 2021. The Asthma Program: Our mission is making children with asthma breathe easier and free from asthma symptoms. A group of enthusiastic and experienced nurses and providers collaborate and apply the latest asthma management guidelines, including monitoring and improving adherence via a comprehensive Medication Management Program. The Sleep Center cares for sleep-related breathing disorders, insomnia, parasomnias, narcolepsy and other hypersomnia, circadian rhythm disorders and rhythmic movements disorders, and restless legs syndrome. The Center is unique for having on staff a dedicated sleep respiratory therapist to support families and children treated with Positive Airway Pressure therapy. The Bronchopulmonary Clinic , directed by Dr. Robert Hingre, strives to provide comprehensive care to infants born with extreme prematurity or other serious congenital problems that will affect their pulmonary function. Care is provided from the time of discharge from the NICU and continues throughout childhood for patients who have long-term pulmonary problems. Aerodigestive Disorders: We coordinate the care of these children with complex medical issues with Pediatric GI, Pediatric ENT, and Speech pathologists. Neuromuscular Disorders: We work with Pediatric Neurology on application of noninvasive ventilation and cough assist device for infants with SMA type 1 and children/adolescents with Duchene muscular dystrophy. We care for respiratory complications in children with neuromuscular disorders, such as aspiration and restrictive lung diseases. We care for children dependent on invasive and non-invasive assisted ventilation. Department of Pediatrics47 We treat rare lung diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and interstitial lung diseases , and lobar emphysema. Pulmonary Pediatric Psychology collaborates with pulmonary providers and offers assessment and intervention services to address emotional, behavioral, and social concerns related to pulmonary medical diagnoses (e.g., sleep difficulties, treatment compliance/adherence, coping with disease burden, medical/procedural anxiety, adjustment to new diagnosis). We offer comprehensive pediatric pulmonary function assessments and cardiorespiratory stress testing. A 5-bed Pediatric Sleep Laboratory within Upstate Sleep Laboratory provide overnight comprehensive sleep studies, home sleep studies, Multiple Sleep Latency, and Maintenance of Wakefulness tests. Flexible bronchoscopy is provided at the Pediatric Surgery Center in 3 North, University Hospital. Outpatient care is provided at the Physician Office Building suite 503. Inpatients are cared for both in the Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital and the Crouse Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

Through this program, we work to reduce hospital-acquired harm and staff injuries. We were honored to be named \"Hospital of the Month\" from SPS in July, 2021, for achieving goals of zero pressure injuries per 1000 patient days, zero central line infections per 1000 line days, AND zero unplanned extubations per 100 ventilator days, an accomplishment shared by only 20 other hospitals nationwide. Our current Preventable Harm Index is 5 children, and our current Serious Safety Event rate is 1.29 per 10,000 adjusted patient days in early 2022, down from around 3.02 in 2021. We are also active participants in the Pediatric Trauma process improvement program, the Pediatric Surgery process improvement program, the Children's Hospital Association Improving Pediatric Sepsis Outcomes collaborative, local projects of our own design, and more. For faculty we have an American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification (MOC) portfolio program; since starting in 2019 we have approved 9 separate quality improvement projects and have been approved for a 2-year renewal. Educational Highlights Our program has three distinct phases occurring over the three-year training cycle with a few longitudinal elements, in addition to quarterly didactic sessions. 1. First year Pediatric residents complete the Institute for Healthcare Improvement basic certificate online, do the solutions for patient safety error prevention course, and develop a proposed SMART aim and PDSA cycle. The last two are worksheets, which they are encouraged to prepare in small groups. 2. In the second year we take those proposed PDSA cycles and add to them faculty mentors and QI mentors who strongly encourage completion of the PDSA cycle including data, submission for MOC credit and presentation 3. In the third year each resident does a Morbidity & Mortality conference (M&M) for grand rounds on a case in which they believe we could have done better. Preparation includes identifying a faculty mentor, developing an interdisciplinary team, identifying health equity factors, doing an event timeline, a cause analysis fishbone, and an impact/effort grid for proposed system improvements. Since redesigning our M&M conference in this manner two years ago, we have had 28 conferences yielding 61 recommended systems improvements, of which 20 have been implemented thus far. Finally, for first time test takers of the American Board of Pediatrics certification exam, our graduating residents have scored a perfect 300 on the \"Research Methods, Patient Safety, and Quality Improvement\" subsection on both the 2020 and 2021 exams. Biennial Report 2020-202150 Pediatric Rheumatology and Integrative Medicine Faculty Caitlin Sgarlat, DO, MSc, Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Division Director; Department of Pediatrics Wellness Officer; Upstate Information Technology Medical Advisor William Hannan, MD, Associate Professor of Pediatrics Anjali Sethi Sura, MD, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics Clinical Overview The Division of Pediatric Rheumatology provides comprehensive evaluation and treatment of children, adolescents, and young adults with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), juvenile dermatomyositis, and other related disorders, as well as inflammatory processes associated with COVID-19 infection. Other children seen in the Pediatric Arthritis Center include those referred for post-infectious causes of joint pain and arthritis, evaluation of acute and chronic joint pain, limp, and fevers of unknown origin. All patients referred to the Pediatric Arthritis Center are seen and evaluated by one of our pediatric rheumatologists. There is also a nurse dedicated to the program who is available for teaching families and children. Other ancillary services include pediatric physical and occupational therapy, social work, and child life. There are now over 200 children with chronic rheumatologic disease followed by the division. Integrative care is also offered in our Division of Pediatric Rheumatology and Integrative Medicine. The pediatric rheumatology clinic is a participating site in the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA). Dr. Caitlin Sgarlat is a member of CARRA's research collaborative to prevent, treat and cure pediatric rheumatic diseases. Dr. Sgarlat also incorporates integrative methods of medicine in combination with, when needed, conventional practices. Educational Highlights Our Rheumatology providers have medical students, residents, and graduate medical fellows rotate with them in both Pediatric Rheumatology and Pediatric Integrative Medicine Clinics. They give formal and impromptu lectures and do teaching on various diseases and treatment management as we see patients, as well as topics regarding integrative therapies and tools. They also give our Pediatric Rheumatology Lecture series to the residents each year consisting of at least 2 formal lectures. Dr. Sgarlat provides wellness lectures and workshops for our residents. Research Highlights The Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic was accepted in 2012 as a \"small site\" member of the CARRA, which is a national collaborative research group. The division continues to participate in quality improvement projects regularly. In 2021, the IRB approved two projects that are part of a multidisciplinary collaboration that the in which division is actively participating. One is Cytokine Profiling of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C); the other is a IS-C Collaborative quality project. Division Highlights Another important clinical highlight was the creation of the innovative Pediatric Integrative Medicine Clinic. This clinic has also grown substantially since its inception in 2015. Prior to this creation there was not a resource of Integrative Medicine for children in Central New York. In this clinic, Dr. Sgarlat strives to enhance each patient's health and wellbeing, as well as prevent and treat disease. Integrative methods of medicine, in combination with any necessary conventional practices, are Department of Pediatrics51 offered in a welcoming and stimulating peaceful environment. A comprehensive integrative approach is used. This approach is anchored in lifestyle medicine in combination with nurturing intrinsic healing of the whole patient. Integrative treatment can include any of the following modalities: dietary recommendations (supplements, botanicals), mind/body medicine (guided imagery, yoga, breathing techniques), manual medicine (massage therapy, physical therapy), and whole medicinal systems (Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine therapies such as acupuncture or acupressure, and aromatherapy). Specialists in our Division of Rheumatology and Integrative Medicine provide comprehensive services for the evaluation and management of infants, children, and adolescents with rheumatologic disorders. Children are often referred to a pediatric rheumatologist by their doctor for a variety of symptoms that are often puzzling. We provide an interdisciplinary approach that often includes nursing care, various treatments, referrals to other specialists including ophthalmology and orthopedics, and referral to physical and occupational therapy.Biennial Report 2020-202152 Other Pediatric Specialties Pediatric Anesthesiology Faculty Joseph Resti, MD, Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology, Director of Pediatric Anesthesiology Jadwiga Bednarczyk, MD, Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology Rahila Bilal, MD, Associate Professor of Anesthesiology, Co-Director of Pediatric Anesthesiology Elizabeth Demers Lavelle, MD, Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology Chiagozie Fawole, MD, Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology Robert Kale, MD, Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology, Director of Pediatric Regional Anesthesia Venkata Sampathi, MD, Clinical Instructor of Anesthesiology Bettina Smallman, MD, Professor of Anesthesiology and Pediatrics Clinical Overview The Division of Pediatric Anesthesiology in the Department of Anesthesiology continues to experience significant growth. Surgeons from all specialties provide care for children requiring surgery in the Olivia Louise Pietrafesa Center for Children's Surgery (CCS). In addition, the demand for procedures conducted outside the operating room environment (CT, MRI, Interventional Radiology, Radiation Therapy, and Nuclear Medicine) continues to grow steadily. The pediatric medical specialties, such as pulmonology and gastroenterology, have increased their procedural volume, and the pediatric oncologists have continued to utilize pediatric anesthesiology services frequently for interventional procedures. As one of the few referral centers in Central New York for children undergoing MRIs and CTs, we have been able to streamline the process, making it safe and efficient to accommodate an ever-increasing demand. The Pediatric Anesthesia Division participates actively in anesthesia coverage at the Upstate Ambulatory Surgical Center. The Pediatric Anesthesia Division continued to show a strong commitment to the education of our anesthesiology residents and medical students. In addition to active participation in patient care, residents rotating in pediatric anesthesiology undergo a series of didactic lectures and journal clubs. Our team also teaches basic pediatric airway skills to Pediatric and Emergency Medicine residents and fellows who rotate through the CCS. Our Division of Pediatric Anesthesiology consists of 8 fellowship-trained pediatric anesthesiologists. Our clinical care extends throughout Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital (GCH), providing services within our five-operating room Center for Children's Surgery, along with many outside of the OR locations, including MRI, CT scan, interventional radiology, and radiation oncology. We also care for all surgical patients at the Level 4 NICU at neighboring Crouse Hospital, who are temporarily transferred to GCH at Upstate specifically for surgical and anesthesiology care. Department of Pediatrics53 Pediatric Cardiovascular-Thoracic Surgery Faculty George M. Alfieris, MD, Clinical Associate Professor of Surgery and Pediatrics Mohamed F. Algahim, MD, Clinical Assistant Professor of Surgery Shuichi Yoshitake, MD, Clinical Assistant Professor of Surgery Clinical Overview Syracuse is fortunate to have a high quality, nationally known program in congenital cardiac surgery. Part of the reason this program has been successful is the innovative arrangement Dr. George Alfieris has developed with the University of Rochester, by which his time is shared between both institutions. This has enabled both programs to benefit from skilled surgery and has allowed Dr. Alfieris and his colleagues to undertake a higher volume of cases than he would at either center alone. The team also provides crucial support to our ECMO program. Thirty-six life-sized fiberglass horses arrived in Syracuse on Dec. 18, 2001, as part of the High Falls Brewing Company's fund-raising community art project, \"Horses On Parade.\" Only a few of the horses still stand in Syracuse today. This pony greets you inside the entrance of Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital.Biennial Report 2020-202154 Pediatric Emergency Medicine Faculty Tyler Greenfield, DO, Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine and Pediatrics, Medical Director Leah Bennett, MD, MPH, Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine and Pediatrics Vincent Calleo, MD, Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine and Pediatrics Gregory P.

Turk, MD, SUNY Distinguished Service Professor, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Pediatrics, Pubic Health & Preventive Medicine David M. Kanter, MD, Clinical Assistant Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinical Overview Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine (PRM), a subspecialty of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, provides diagnostic and management services to improve the health and functional abilities of individuals with a variety of disability conditions. Disabilities can be temporary or permanent, new onset or longstanding, and typically interfere with the ability to perform developmentally appropriate activities of daily living, mobility, and social engagement. The Upstate Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation provides state-of-the-art rehabilitation and therapy services, with access to new therapies, equipment/devices, technology, and research protocols not otherwise available in the region. We provide services throughout the life continuum for children and youth, young adults, and adults with childhood onset disability. Our services are focused on enhancing function and promoting health and well-being. With the use of home and center-based therapies, assistive devices, a team approach, medications, counseling, education, and community resources, our goal is to improve our patients' quality of life. Services are provided in both outpatient and inpatient settings. Outpatient Services: In the outpatient setting we see children and adults with childhood onset disabilities with many different functional issues, from toe walking to spastic quadriplegia stemming from a variety of conditions. Diagnoses and conditions seen include: cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury and dysfunction, spina bifida, non-surgical orthopedic issues, concussion, muscle diseases, nerve disorders, brachial plexus burns, hypermobility and Ehlers Danlos syndrome, plagiocephaly. Examples of Outpatient Services provided: Overall Assessment: history taking and examinations focus on age appropriate function, with an emphasis on an accessible, comfortable and comforting environment for patients and parents/care providers. Tone Management: assessment of spasticity and abnormal muscle tone to determine the appropriate therapeutic option: focused therapy/rehabilitation services and positioning, oral medications, botulinum toxin injections, consideration for and management of intrathecal baclofen, evaluation for selective dorsal rhizotomy and rehabilitation care following surgery. Management and Direction of Therapies: close working relationship with therapists at Upstate and within the community to help determine best interventions to improve function and relieve pain, as well as for full evaluations for mobility devices. Access to state-of-the-art interventions offers a wide variety of services. Adult Spina Bifida Clinic with participation in the Spina Bifida Registry program, supported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. Bracing Management: evaluation for and prescription of bracing for the arms and/or legs to improve functional abilities; working closely with the orthotists in the community, we ensure each patient is prescribed and receives the bracing they need. Biennial Report 2020-202166 Mobility Management: evaluation for appropriate mobility devices including canes, crutches, walkers, gait trainers, standers, and wheelchairs. Many devices can be trialed to determine best options. Education Support: working with different schools and systems, along with referral to our Rehabilitation Counselor, provides possibilities for patients to fully access their educational opportunities. Close Collaboration with Other Pediatric Specialties: as an example, intrathecal baclofen pump placement and selective dorsal rhizotomy are performed by pediatric neurosurgery. PRM manages the intrathecal pump as well as the needed rehabilitation following selective dorsal rhizotomy. Inpatient Services: Inpatient Pediatric Rehabilitation Services often begin with consultation during acute hospitalization at the Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital. Initial assessments by the PRM specialists determines what services will be needed to promote function and return to home. Discharge to home from the acute hospital with outpatient or home services may provide the needed support, however a more comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation program may be the best option. For children who require a broad range of services following some type of life altering event - orthopedic trauma, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, nerve disorders, muscle disorders, amputation, and burns - the Upstate Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility provides the needed services. The Upstate Rehabilitation Program is the only program in the region offering inpatient rehabilitation services to children. For patients who are hospitalized outside of Upstate, referrals are reviewed for possible admission. A dedicated team of professionals including physicians, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, music therapy, child life, social work, case management, therapeutic recreation, and psychology work with patients and their families throughout the admission. Families are an integral part of the team, and play an important role in the rehabilitation process, especially discharge planning. Family members are welcome to stay with their children on the rehabilitation unit. Following discharge, follow-up for continued support and management with the PRM specialist is scheduled. Education Highlights The Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine staff are involved with the education of Upstate medical students and the Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation residents. PRM staff provide clinical educational experiences for medical students rotating through the department, including summer students just having finished their first year of medical school and 3rd and 4th year medical students rotating through their neuroscience clerkship or rehabilitation elective.
