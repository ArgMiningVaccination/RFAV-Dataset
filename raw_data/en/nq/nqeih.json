Part of that commitment is a focus on strong photography and design. When The Calgary Journal set out to create a cover for its May/June 2016 issue, it seemed as though the possibilities were endless \u2014 and they were. However, once story ideas began to take shape and the issue's themes emerged, it became clear that the cover should focus on death and the afterlife, an issue that touches everyone's life. So, how do you represent an inherently dark theme without making it dreary and depressing? THE USE OF EYE-CATCHING COLOURSThe answer is colour, of course! The Calgary Journal decided to create a cover respectful of the issue's sensitive theme while using eye-catching colours and design. The first step in the process was to brainstorm specific ideas for the cover. Jesse Yardley developed a conceptual sketch for the team to consider. Once the idea was solidified, members of the cover team divided up tasks and set to work preparing for the photo-shoot. Amara McLaughlin found the cover model, MacKenzie Dundas. Savaya Shinkaruk provided the clothing and sourced a talented make-up artist, Janet Dyer. On the day of the cover shoot, Kate Holowaty assisted with the set design, while Max Foley put his technical skills to use setting up studio lights and the remote camera trigger. Jesse Yardley snapped the photo that was ultimately selected for the cover. DESIGN MATTERS With the photo shoot complete, the final step in the process was to design the cover. Jesse Yardley layed out a cover concept using bright green and orange, but when the team saw the design, it was decided that pink would be a more attractive pairing. The change dramatically improved the design. The final step involved writing the headlines and story teases.

The city is not known as a cultural mecca with innovative infrastructure nor reputable cultural spaces. However, change is happening at cultural institutions like the 50-year-old Glenbow Museum, the new home of the National Music Centre (NMC), which will soon be opening this summer, and the massive New Central Library (NCL) which may become a popular down-town meeting place. These develop-ments may have an impact on locals and visitors by providing an opportuni-ty to access more cultural spaces. The city is taking bold steps to en- sure Calgary continues to be vibrant and robust. Cultural spaces \u2014 in a high-culture context such as museums, libraries, music centres and art galleries \u2014 are continually evolving away from the reputation of being an authorita-tive experience to being innovative and collective experiences. Innovative spaces like the NCL will provide Calgarians with a modernfacil-ity featuring state-of-the-art technol-ogy in approximately 240,000 sq. ft. of space. The new structure will sit above a light rail transit line and will be home to approximately 600,000 books, a labora-tory and age-speci/f_i c areas for children and teens. The Calgary Municipal Land Corpo-ration is quarterbacking the develop-ment team for the NCL. Susan Veres, senior vice-president, strategy and business development, con/f_i rms that construction is on schedule. \"At the end of this year, a major mile- stone will be achieved as a superstruc-ture support will be in place allowing the building to take its form. \" The library is expected to be complete and opened to the public in 2018.

In urban areas 30 per cent resulted in a fatality. According to Trans-portation Alberta o cials, speed is the primary factor of this high number of rural fatalities. \"De/f_i nitely on a rural road, the posted speed is much higher, so really what you're working against there is the municipal law of physics. The likelihood of dying in a high speed crash is very high, \" says Liz Owens, the department's director of policy and research. According to Owens, Alberta's tra c safety plan introduced back in 2007 looks into tra c safety and tackles road issues of all sorts, while aiming to keep Alberta's drivers safe on all roads. She says there has been a signi/f_i cant decline in the number of fatalities since the plan was introduced. The lowest number on record is 313 fatalities in 2011. Owens also assures that the Alberta Tra c Safety Plan and their safety part-ners are going to be looking deeper into the more vulnerable areas in the future, such as pedestrians, cyclists, and intersection safety.Fatal accidents more common on rural roads in Alberta O cials say speed is the number one factor mamche@cjournal.ca MALAK AMCHE PHOTOS COURTESY OF WAWATOTO.COM 70% Fatalities Many immigrant men feel isolated, fearful and lost upon arrival in Canada, according to multiple researchers and social agencies in the country. Vic Lantion, a program coordinator with the Ethno- Cultural Council of Calgary (ECCC), explains that many of his clients are men su ering from clinical depression. \"They wake up at 3 a.m. asking themselves, 'What am I doing here?'\" says Lantion. Lantion explains that these men often struggle to cope with their ethnic and cultural expectations, which are often distorted during their resettlement process. After immigrating, they and their wives often /f_i nd jobs or new avenues of social expression that might not have existed in their home countries. At the same time, however, a lack of research on how immigrant men handle these changes makes it di cult to resolve these issues. IMMIGRANT MEN HESITATE TO REACH OUT Even when they're struggling with mental health issues, many of these men might not ask for help because their culture sees it as weakness. \"Man from visible minorities have more societal pressure not to seek support, \" says Lantion. Only 25 per cent of immigrants seek support with social agencies, and most of them are women, according to Lantion. This puts male newcomers at a disadvantage because they aren't receiving the support they need to overcome the challenges of resettlement. Back in their home countries, these men also enjoy a certain respect and prestige connected with their careers\u2014one which that they might lose in Canada when forced to take other jobs, explains Lantion. A lack of research on how immigrant men handle these changes makes it di cult to resolve these issues. \"If you're highly educated, you have a hard time accepting you're not a doctor or a lawyer anymore, \" says Lantion, who adds men are psychologically a ected by underemployment and the challenges of getting their credentials recognized. \"Men are having a cultural shock in regards [to] their gender identity and values, \" he says. Calgary Immigrant Women's Association (CIWA) CEO Beba Svigir, says men don't seek help as often as their wives due to many reasons. One reason she cites is that some men don't trust government and social agencies: \"Men feel very uncomfortable because they feel the government [might] undermine their authority. \" WOMEN INTEGRATE MORE SUCCESSFULLY From his experience working with Ethiopian, Somali, Filipino and other immigrant communities in Calgary, Lantion found that men were worse o after resettling in Canada compared to women. \"In the long term, immigrant women are being more successful than men, \" he says. In their traditional family roles, immigrant men are often pressured to be family providers. Meanwhile, women are expected to take care of the children. Because immigrant women tend to have more free time, they attend social programs, improving their language and their employment skills, says Lantion. \"In the long term, immigrant women are being more successful than men. \" \"Culturally, men are supposed to be the providers, \" says Priyadarshini Kharat, a counsellor at the University of Calgary, who found in her PhD research that ethnic men were afraid of being ashamed and ostracized by their communities for not ful/f_i lling their roles as breadwinners. Svigir agrees with Lantion that women are often more successful than men. She says men feel more \"entitled\" to cling to their careers than women, which creates self-esteem problems. WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE Lantion says this doesn't happen to the same extent with women, as their identities aren't tied to their profession, but to their role as mothers: \"When women move to Canada, no one can take away their identity as a mothers. \" David Este, a University of Calgary social work professor, has conducted research on immigrant male refugees over the last 16 years. He says many ethnic men see themselves as failures if their spouse has to work, which is often the case in cities like Calgary, which are expensive to live in. Women sometimes /f_i nd work easier than men as they're more /f_l exible at the time of employment, says Este. \"Women are more pragmatic; they need to work to survive economically. \" \"Women are very resilient and they will do whatever to succeed, \" says Svigir, who adds that female immigrants are open to seeking help, changing careers and accepting any job for the wellbeing of their children. Many ethnic men see themselves as failures if their spouse has to work. Este says men struggle more to adjust their newly necessary responsibilities. \"Immigrant men in Canada are doing domestic chores they would never do in their home countries, \" he states. He adds that back in their countries, couples would get support from extended family members to raise their children\u2014something not available in Canada. \"There is a [saying]: 'It takes a village to raise a child, '\" says Este. MEN TRADITIONALLY IGNORED BY THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY\"There is a humongous gap in the research about immigrant men, \" says Kharat, who did her PhD research on intimate partner violence among immigrants from South Asia in Canada. Because this demographic is often neglected by the research community, there is a lack of understanding of how the immigration process in/f_l uences the well-being of men as well as their likelihood to commit domestic violence, says Kharat. Lantion echoes Kharat, saying there are few if any studies on how men are adapting to egalitarian values. Last year, this gap lead to the creation of a survey by multiple Alberta social agencies, including the ECCC, to better understand the barriers immigrant men face when resettling. Preliminary results found that 96 per cent of men said it was important to have support, but only one in four men knew of any support service for men in Canada.NEWS Resettlement woes Newly-immigrated men struggle to nd identity drodriguez@cjournal.ca DANIEL RODRIGUEZImmigrant men /f_i nd it di cult to integrate into Canadian society. PHOTO COURTESY OF KAT NORTHERN LIGHTS MAN | FLICKR 6 MAY/JUNE 2016 CALGARYJOURNAL.CAFor decades, experts and politicians have tried to educate children about drug and alcohol use by concentrating on the message, \"Just say no. \" Studies, however, show campaigns such as Project D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) had little to no impact. Experts say, once kids discovered that they could use drugs without dying or su ering permanent damage, they realized that much of what they were told about drugs was a lie. Calgary health educator Cheryl Houtekamer says such programs failed to teach kids how to avoid drugs, how to go about saying \"no, \" and how to /f_i nd alternatives. \"It was very focused on the horrible consequences but [there was] very little information or support on how to prevent and build healthier people, \" says Houtekamer. Houtekamer, an Alberta Health Services program supervisor who manages health promotion services in the Calgary region says, today's approach o ers young people many more tools and skills to deal with stress and self-esteem. The push is to give them more evidence-based information, rather than simplistic messages, which have been proven ine ective. A 1999 study from the University of Kentucky examined the impact of Project D.A.R.E. a decade after the program was rolled out. Just over 1,000 individuals, who had either received the D.A.R.E. program or a standard drug-education curriculum, were re-evaluated at age 20. The study concluded the D.A.R.E. program had no discernible impact on the students who took it, and very few di erences were found in terms of drug use, attitudes towards drugs, or self-esteem. D.A.R.E. was widely ridiculed. Recognizing that telling kids to \"just say no\" wasn't helpful, Houtekamer says Alberta Health Services designed a more evidence-based, developmentally appropriate curriculum for grades 3 to 12. It encourages skill development by teaching young people how to manage stress, how to cultivate healthy relationships and how to communicate with people more e ectively. The curriculum is available for free on the AHS website. \"We're building these resilient youth who have skill sets so that if someone is feeling down or they've had something bad happen to them in their life, rather than say, 'I'm going to go use drugs' or 'I'm going to go drink, ' they have all these other things that they could do, \" Houtekamer says. While drug educators contacted by The Calgary Journal agree they are making progress, there is still some disagreement about approaches. For example, Calgary harm reduction specialist Dominique Denis-Lalonde says people could learn from how she and others work on the front lines with young people using drugs at outdoor music festivals, such as the Shambhala Music Festival near Nelson, B.C. Because the festival is on private property, she and others are able to provide on-the-ground support to people using drugs. This entails volunteers performing drugs tests for festival-goers, inviting youth who are having di cult experiences into safe spaces, and training volunteers to spot problems and connect directly with young people who are using drugs. Denis-Lalonde says many youth at festivals on municipal property are also running into problems, but harm reduction specialists like her aren't always welcome to do their work. \"As I see it, it has a lot to with our drug policy and how we want to just turn a blind eye and [pretend] it's not happening at all at our events, but it clearly is. \" Another area where young people are using drugs is post-secondary institutions. Ria Meronek, a counsellor with Mount Royal University Wellness Services, sees many students, some who would have been exposed to programs such as D.A.R.E., lack good mechanisms to deal with the challenges that life throws at them, causing some to abuse drugs or alcohol. \"What makes one student successful over the other in terms of dealing with stress?\" Meronek asks. \"Do they have good stress managements skills or are they turning to something as a quick /f_i x to avoid or to escape?\" She wholly supports all approaches that teach younger children to tackle problems in healthier ways, including stress management and emotional regulation. The result, she says, is well-balanced adults and a healthier society.

PHOTO BY ASHLEY MATERIWITH FILES FROM MELANIE WALSHPublic schools in South Austin, Texas are implementing an interactive business education program for grades k-12 to impressive results, but Calgary schools do not have a similar program for students in this age range - something some business-minded residents think should change. Craig Shapiro is the principal of David Crockett High School, the /f_i rst high school to implement the Crockett Entrepreneurship Program in South Austin. Shapiro says the program's objective is to teach students how to apply their knowledge in real-world situations. \"One of the major problems that I'm facing as a principal, and most other principals are facing, is this idea that kids are now risk-adverse, \" says Shapiro. \"Their creativity has been drained through the constant testing and kids don't want to be wrong. \" To help change this, the new program has students learn in a \"micro-society\" environment through elementary school. Each grade operates a speci/f_i c business, which get increasingly advanced as students progress to higher grades. In addition, the students experience what it is like to interact with external forces, such as radio stations, a city council and a mayor, through the lens of their businesses' needs. Shapiro says that in junior high school, students go on to code and create their own videogame, which teaches them about the cycle of creation all the way to producing the product. \"The idea is to push them through cycles and having them learn how to fail, \" he adds. In high school students will use all the skills they have developed over the years to create a business model to pitch to real-life investors. And in their senior year, students will actually run the businesses that they have created. \"The classroom we built for them looks like Google, \" says Shapiro. \"It doesn't look like rows or desks; it's literally an o ce space that you would /f_i nd in any major corporation today. \" Shapiro says that he can see his students responding positively to the program and others like it. He says parents tell him that their children are actually \"excited\" about learning now. So far this program has tangible, positive impacts on the educational environment in Texas. The school's graduation rate rose from 74 per cent to 94 per cent, the dropout rate decreased from 5.7 per cent to one per cent, and the attendance rate increased from 88 per cent to 95 per cent. Despite this kind of success, Calgary primary and secondary schools have nothing quite like the Crockett Entrepreneurship Program yet. Karen Ryhorchuk, a senior communications specialist for the Calgary Catholic school district, says Catholic high schools o er quite a few programs related to business education, ranging from customer service to marketing. She also says these grades work with Junior Achievement, a non-pro/f_i t organization that involve students in grades 5-12 to teach them business and free enterprise education. At a high school level, students have the option to work with Junior Achievement in an after school program that gives them an opportunity to create a business. However, Ryhorchuk did not mention other business education options in grades below the high school level. As for the city's public school system, media representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Currently, the public school curriculum has business options similar to those available for Catholic school students. However, a program called the Career and Technology Foundations Program of Studies \u2014 which would teach students in grades /f_i ve to nine about di erent skills, knowledge and technologies by working with community members \u2014 is pending approval from the province. Judy McMillan-Evans, a professor and leader in post-secondary entrepreneurship education, believes that Calgary primary and secondary schools should have more business options available from grades k-12. McMillan-Evans says she admires the Crockett Entrepreneurship Program and was ecstatic when she /f_i rst heard about it. \"I think [the Crockett program] opens the door for ideas. It helps [the students] to understand how they can be in charge of their own livelihood and their own future. \" Similarly, two Calgary-based post-secondary students pursuing business degrees believe that kids would respond positively to more business education in primary and secondary schools in the city. Mackenzie Myles and Carly Fielding of ReCreate help younger students learn about the world of business through fun activities. \"I think [business education is] super important. Because I didn't really have anything like that and I came into school and I was going into business and I wasn't really sure. It helps put some real-life perspective in everything, \" says Fielding, ReCreate's project lead. Created in 2012, ReCreate is a project helmed by students of Mount Royal University's Enactus group. The project teaches students in grades 4-7 how to reduce their environmental footprint through the process of making crafts out of trash and recycling materials. After the crafts are complete, the kids sell their products, learning valuable business skills, and the proceeds then go to charity. Fielding and Myles both agree that an entrepreneurship program like the one in South Austin would be valuable to young students because their creativity isn't \"sti/f_l ed\" yet. \"Having that build-up so it's not so intimidating, so from k-9, they really understand what entrepreneurship is... I think that's what they need to really focus on, \" says Myles. 8 MAY/JUNE 2016 CALGARYJOURNAL.CANew classrooms to look like Google Public schools in USA implementing program focused on teaching entrepreneurial values Carly Fielding (left) and Mackenzie Myles (right) are two Mount Royal University students involved with Enactus, a global entrepreneurial society.

But consent isn't as prominent a part of Alberta's sexual education curriculum, something experts believe should change. Consent became a large portion of the Ontario curriculum for grades one through eight in 2015, with students learning how consent is given. That curriculum also stresses \"the need to communicate clearly with each other when making decisions about sexual activity in the relationship\" and features 17 other statements about consent. Perhaps most importantly, Ontario is now teaching those concepts to students who are in grade one, according to Global News. Although the Ontario curriculum sparked some controversy amongst parents, Terry Humphreys, a psychology professor at Trent University who specializes in research on sexual experiences, believes consent education is very important to all ages. \"We're not teaching your kids how to have sex, we're teaching them things like values about respect, respecting each other, respecting boundaries of another person, \" says Humphreys. Alex McKay, executive director of Sex Information and Education Council of Canada, agrees and believes if children are more aware about the concept of consent, it could be help to prevent sexual assault. \"The concept of consent, as it relates to personal, individual anatomy particularly with respect to the body, that that is a concept we want to be teaching to kids at quite an early age, \" says McKay.Currently in Alberta, the majority of topics regarding consent are not taught until junior high and high school levels. \"The ideas associated with sexual consent are found in our current seven to nine program of study, \" says an email from Jeremy Nolais, chief of sta for Alberta's education minister. \"All other mentions of consent are in the non-mandated teaching prompts. According to Nolais, Alberta education does believe in sexual education through all grades. In fact, their curriculum \u2014 which was last updated in 2002 \u2014 is under review. \"Regarding changes to curriculum, Alberta education is presently engaged in provincial curriculum development to ensure future programs of study will build upon a foundation of literacy and numeracy, and the development of competencies students will need to be successful in the future, \" says Nolais in an email. Nolais also explains, in comparison to the Ontario curriculum where only one course of health and physical education is required between grades nine to 12 for graduation, Alberta's health and life skills and physical education courses are mandatory for grade nine students along with career and life management course and physical education in grade 10. Although, Danielle Aubry, executive director of Calgary Communities Against Sexual Abuse says she believes the concept of consent should be taught better in Alberta schools, she also believes it should only be taught if it will be communicated well by an unbiased individual who can handle the discomfort both adults and children face when discussing sexual health. According to Aubry, that's because many individuals are lacking a connection with their sexuality to understand consensual sex in a healthy way. Humphrey, who is also the president for the Society for the Scienti/f_i c Study of Sexuality says, \"cross the country, there's a little bit of inconsistency around when issues speci/f_i c to sexual consent get taught, but I'm a big believer in sex education from kindergarten on. \" A Canadian wide curriculum could ensure all Canadian students learn at the same grade level, but today this change cannot be made as education is under provincial jurisdiction. McKay adds, \"it's becoming clear that when we look at the range of sexual health challenges facing todays youth, we can see pretty clearly that in many respects the challenges are the same compared to past generations but that there are a number of issues currently at the forefront, one of which revolves around consent. \" Experts believe that following Ontario's lead and teaching consent at earlier ages can help prevent sexual assault.

As I walked from my car to the front door of the tall brick building, I couldn't help notice the obvious di erences between myself and the others. Disgruntled expressions. Baggy clothing. Unkept hair. Nicotine. On the edge of the East Village I felt miles away from the comforts that I am accustomed to in suburbia. \"Did I lock the car?\" I remember thinking. I pressed the lock button on the remote one more time just in case. I was there to serve lunch, but throughout the afternoon, I realized I was about to learn a few things too. The DI is a refuge for many Calgarians caught in the clutches of homelessness, and in many cases, the propeller needed to escape its grasp. Through a variety of programs such as a cafeteria service, a ordable housing and education, the DI helps people get back on their feet. The general public often look down upon the clients of the DI. By looking past the common stigma, the sta members are able to see the individuals beneath the stereotypes, and help, judgment aside. I was bordering on being late, and so I did my best to suppress the feelings of discomfort /f_i lling my head. I rushed inside to reception and paged Jordan Hamilton, public relations director and my tour guide for the day. A few minutes later Hamilton arrived and guided me to the cafeteria on the second /f_l oor. While we climbed the staircase, I heard an array of voices that blurred into a cloud of roaring white noise as we approached the doorway leading into the cafeteria. Inside, sta in orange shirts hustled about while men and women waiting for a meal lined the chairs. Hamilton led me up the middle aisle towards the back counter where volunteers waited to start serving the food. The DI serves three meals a day, seven days a week, for anyone over 18. Like a waitress, I carried plates of coleslaw, breaded /f_i sh and fries back and forth across the room. Some said thanks with a big smile, others nodded and some didn't say much. I was okay with that. A collection of di erent circumstances bring people to this place \u2014 poor upbringing, downturn in the economy, addiction, job loss and unemployment \u2014 it was then I realized I couldn't pass judgment on any of them. Today, I am thankful I got to experience the DI's lunch program, but it was the time I spent with Hamilton that impacted me most. Seven or eight of us volunteers waited in a small corner of the second /f_l oor for the elevator. To get into the space I squeezed past a woman in pink leaning on crutches. Hamilton saw her and said, \"I like your hair Amber. It is really pretty. \" \"Thanks, \" she blushed. Her friend had styled it for her into a number of tiny half braids. When Hamilton and I got o , he began telling me about the woman in pink. \"Amber is getting married at the centre, \" he told me. \"Her dress is hanging in my o ce. \" She had saved $100 for a wedding dress, but when she asked the DI for some help they introduced her to Durand Bridal and Formal Wear and she was treated like a queen. Without a dollar limit, the store told Amber to /f_i nd her favourite dress and they clothed her and her bridesmaid from head to toe. Amber and her bridesmaid both cried. \"A lot of people wouldn't think you can /f_i nd joy and love and respect in a homeless shelter, but here we do all of those things. This is a safe space where people can /f_i nally be themselves instead of struggling, \" said Hamilton. This is because the DI is not only a shelter from Calgary's cold winter, but also a shelter from the stigma many face on the street. Afterwards I recognized the thoughts that plagued my mind as I walked into the DI were saturated with pre-conceived ideas \u2014 and unfortunately, ideas that many share. People who are homeless are people like you and me, and it is through these human-to-human moments that we start to erase the false impressions we have. I was not alone in this. Hamilton had an experience, which changed his perspective. Shortly after he was hired, while walking home one night he saw a couple of people visibly intoxicated. He got nervous and even started reconsidering his route. \"If I don't look at them, then they won't look at me, \" he thought. He hoped they wouldn't kill him, these \"dangerous horrible people, \" he told me in a sarcastic tone, laughing at the memory. But when he passed by, one of them yelled, \"Sta !\" The man got up, gave him a big hug and added, \"Sta ! You are doing a great job. \" That moment spoke to Hamilton because although he was looking down on the man, the man didn't look down on him. \"It helped me be a better person and to look for the good in people instead of their troubles and struggles. \" asimpson@cjournal.ca AMY SIMPSONThe Calgary Drop-In & Rehab Centre (the DI) is a place that o ers more then just a warm meal and dry roof. PHOTO BY AMY SIMPSONCALGARYJOURNAL.CA MAY/JUNE 2016 11VOICES We arrived in Rome late at night. Though we were sad to leave Munich and the city's gigantic (yet somehow perfectly sized) beers behind, the trip had to go on. We were always tired when we travelled to di erent cities, but as soon as we arrived we would instantly feel energized by our new surroundings. Rome had once seemed like a mythic place that we would only ever see on television \u2014 but there we were, travelling on the train from the airport and slowly making our way towards our rooms for the night. \"Dude, I think you booked the wrong hostel, \" pointed out one of my friends as we checked over our booking information. Struck by a wave of disbelief, I checked for myself. Sure enough, the hostel my friends had booked was a sister to mine, baring a slightly di erent name \u2014 that must have been what got me. It was a dumb mistake that I now had to pay the price for. The Alessandro Palace would house /f_i ve of my travelling companions that night. The Alessandro Downtown had set aside a single bed for me, and me alone. \"Don't worry, man, \" the guys tried to reassure me. \"I'm sure our hostel will have enough space for one extra person. \" Su ce to say, it did not. I was on my own.A 15-minute walk separated our hostels, but in a foreign city, on foreign streets, without access to Google Maps, those 15 minutes felt more like 15 miles of uncharted territory. When I was seven or eight, my parents would hand me a map, a real one, and I would be in charge of directions. Now, at the age of 20, my brain cells are few and iPhones have sucked the practicality from my hollow noggin. The /f_i rst night came and went, and despite my circumstances, I managed to have a great deal of fun. My friends and I were out drinking at this bar next to their hostel until two or three in the morning. The next afternoon, I still hadn't heard from them since going our separate ways the night before. The day was dwindling away, second by second, minute by minute. My hostel room had more than 10 bunk beds, and perched like a stone gargoyle on the ledge of the top bunk I was assigned, I could see all of them were deserted. All the other travellers were out adventuring, and there I was, by myself, waiting for a message from my friends that may never come. So, I had a choice to make.I looked beyond the hollow emptiness of my fortress, out past the room's only window to the world outside. The Roman sky was overcast and dreary \u2014 sheer irony considering the events of our time here thus far. Yet it was compelling, in its own way, calling to me as I used the spotty hostel Wi-Fi to contact my friends. Were they still sleeping in a foolish attempt to purge dense hangovers? Did they venture o into the ancient city, toward adventure, without me? Either way, I was abandoned.My bunk bed had a stunted ladder built into the frame, but I chose to jump o instead. An unnatural burst of energy pushed the stillness of my own hangover out of my body. I was no longer a statue. Shaking the stone from my skin and packing my backpack, I felt alive. It was time to experience Rome by myself, exposed to danger and wonder not felt when I was with my group. I stepped out of the hostel and instinctively put my sunglasses on. The light felt harsh on my eyes even though clouds blocked the sun. I took out my phone and plugged in my headphones. My Wi-Fi signal had disappeared. I put my iTunes library on shu e, creating a soundtrack for the day that belonged to me exclusively. My eyes took in the scene around me: tourists stopping and gaping at the Roman architecture while vendors, far too familiar with their surroundings to notice the beauty, tried in vain to seize their attention. I took out my map and navigated the winding streets until I reached the Pantheon. The trek took nearly three hours when it should have taken half the time. I dodged several impatient Italian drivers along the way, but their vengeful honking was worth it when I could see the distinct colossal dome in front of me. My /f_i rst step inside almost resulted in a step back in the other direction \u2014 I had never seen anything like it. The paintings, the murals, and the decorated marble interior must have been stolen straight from heaven \u2014 not meant for mortal eyes. Standing in the middle of the Pantheon, I felt honoured to be surrounded by the beauty of the building. It almost felt like I had become part of its rich history simply by being there to experience it. I needed time to take it all in. The tourists around me all vanished. I felt alone and I was glad. No friends to prematurely push me out the entrance and onto the next landmark. In my solitude, I had all the time in the world. pmcaleer@cjournal.ca Paul McAleerAlone in Rome Booking the wrong hostel inspires a solitary journey \"The paintings, the murals, and the decorated marble interior must have been stolen straight from heaven - not meant for mortal eyes. \" - Paul McAleerConstructed in approximately 126 AD, the Pantheon is one of Rome's main attractions. PHOTO BY PAUL MCALEER12 MAY/JUNE 2016 CALGARYJOURNAL.CAVOICES A lack of education and openness in Canadian workspaces may account for a large amount of employees now reporting that they don't understand the signi/f_i cance of an LGBTQ+ identifying individual being \"out\" in the workplace. With attention still on discrimination laws that allow for people to be /f_i red because of their sexual orientation, in the United States after the Supreme Court voted to allow same sex marriage on June 26, 2015, a new study focuses on the Canadian work environment's inclusiveness. But this new report proves that businesses can change this issue by implementing programs and guidelines to further educate employers on LGBTQ+ issues. A recent study by the Canadian Centre of Diversity and Inclusion found that 42.2 per cent of straight identifying employees do not believe it is important for an LGBTQ+ person to be \"out\" in their workplace. For Melodie Sanford, a registered psychologist who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues, this response is consistent with the underlying homophobia and transphobia that still exists within the Canadian workforce. LGBTQ+ experts and supporters speculate that Canadians are not as open-minded and inclusive as they claim to be. \"When you're straight you don't really ever have to come out. When you're straight you're considered to be the norm, \" says Sanford. \"I think that maybe somebody who identi/f_i es as straight, I don't know that they always understand the signi/f_i cance of what it's like to not be able to be open about a part of yourself. \" While some Canadian workers don't directly feel the e ects of LGBTQ+ discrimination, Sanford believes it's important to foster an accepting work environment regardless of your sexual orientation. Bruce McDonald, co-founder and chair of the Canadian Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, agrees. \"Likely it's a lack of education, a lack of exposure to people in the community or people in the workplace that are part of the LGBTQ+ community. \" But without exposure to people within the LGBTQ+ community, individuals who identify as heterosexual may continue to ostracize their queer colleagues, and in some cases unknowingly. McDonald thinks that somebody who does not feel comfortable being themselves at work can cause them to be less productive and less involved in their company, which puts them at risk for being passed over for promotions. \"The conversation around the water cooler, you know, 'What did you do on the weekend?' If you can only tell half the story, you're watching your pronouns, you might seem aloof, so you might not be as included in the company, \" says McDonald, whose organization strives to support and create networks for LGBTQ+ or allied businesses and professionals across Canada. \"People who identify as straight don't realize how much hiding goes on for somebody who can't be honest and open about who they are completely, \" says Sanford. One way to make Canadian workplaces more inclusive is to educate employers about what harassment is and the legislation in place to protect LGBTQ+ identifying people from discrimination. Colin Druhan, executive director of Pride at Work Canada says, \"We always encourage the employers that we work with to take some leadership there and make sure that it's well known within the organization that they have policies that not only re/f_l ect the legal reality in Canada, but their corporate values. So we work with a number of organizations that have made [LGBTQ+] inclusion part of their corporate values and they do everything they can to promote that within the company. \" Druhan's group provides businesses with tools to help foster an open-minded work environment and encourages employers to create visual representations of their commitment to inclusiveness in the o ce. For example, employers can create a day to wear a coloured shirt symbolizing their zero tolerance policy for workplace discrimination. This statement is similar to Pink Shirt Day, a successful anti-bullying initiative. Events and initiatives like these can help take steps to educate people who might not realize the language they use is derogatory or o ensive towards a member of the LGBTQ+ community. In turn, these practices make it easier for an LGBTQ+ person to feel con/f_i dent and comfortable in their work environment. \"Everybody has a responsibility to create inclusive culture and if you're not creating a culture that you know, a rms that, 'Yes, this is a safe place for people to be out and be themselves, ' then you're not actually creating culture that's going to encourage people to come out, \" says Druhan. Coming out in the workplace The Canadian workforce may not be as inclusive as we think Thirty /f_i ve per cent of LGBTQ+ workers feel the need to lie about their personal lives in their workplace. lpeters@cjournal.ca LOGAN PETERS PHOTO BY LOGAN PETERS CALGARYJOURNAL.CA MAY/JUNE 2016 13VOICES School's out forever Calgary's alternative form of education mmackay@cjournal.ca MEGAN MACKAY For thousands of families, the day is structured around school. Any given morning means buses to catch, teachers to please and textbooks to read. But a look inside Judy Arnall's household would yield none of these telltale signs of formal education. For Arnall's children, the world is their classroom. Arnall is practicing something called \"unschooling, \" and is part of a growing movement of people who seek to eschew the formalities of structured education and let children decide for themselves what and how they want to learn. Essentially, an unschooled child does not follow any structured form of education. They do not attend school, nor do they have an assigned curriculum to complete at home, like a homeschooled student would. Unschooling is grounded in the belief that children are naturally driven to learn. \"Just picture a Saturday in July, and that's what a typical day of unschooling looks like for us, \" explains Arnall. Arnall is a Calgary-based author and educator who is president of the Unschooling Canada Association. She's also a mother of /f_i ve unschooled children, three of whom are now in various post-secondary programs. \"Too often we see kids who go through the conveyor belt of school. All of their friends are going to university and they don't really know what to do, \" she says. \"I saw my kids have passions very early. They very quickly explored, experimented, and learned what they really loved to do and they had the time to do it. \" Calgary's unschooling community is vibrant, and growing, according to Elizabeth Surridge, who is a facilitator at Home Learning Connections, one of several school boards in the city that work with unschoolers. Surridge has been working in home education for 16 years.\"I work with two eight-year-olds right now who are starting their own businesses, \" Surridge exclaims, \"One of them is blogging. We have a budding paleobiologist who is just 13 years old. It's wild. \" UNDERSTANDING UNSCHOOLING Unschooling can be di cult to comprehend because by de/f_i nition, the practice is informal. Coined by activist John Holt in 1923, the term means \"allowing children as much freedom to learn in this world as their parents can comfortably bear. \" Naturally, the idea of unschooling might raise some eyebrows. \"One question I often get asked is, 'Isn't that giving kids too much freedom?'\" explains Arnall. \"My response to that is that kids are going to take that freedom anyway. When they tune out in class because they're not interested, they're already choosing what they will and won't learn. \" Idzie Desmarais, a 25-year-old blogger from Montreal who was unschooled after six months of kindergarten echoes Arnall's sentiments. Desmarais is an active writer and conference speaker in the free-education movement who writes a popular blog, titled, I'm Unschooled. Yes, I Can Write. \"Unschooling doesn't mean doing away with any structure whatsoever. It means creating a structure based on the needs of actual people, instead of following a structure designed for the needs of an institution, \" writes Desmarais. The John Holt Book of Homeschooling develops this concept further, noting, \"Learning to read or do quadratic equations are not 'natural' processes, but unschoolers nonetheless learn them when it makes sense for them to do so, not because they have reached a certain age or are compelled to do so by arbitrary authority. It isn't unusual to /f_i nd unschoolers who are barely eight-years-old studying astronomy or are 10-years-old and just learning to read. \" For proponents, unschooling is viewed as a unique opportunity to avoid systems and strict methods, and develop independent ideas out of actual experiences. It's a way for the child to constantly pursue knowledge. This movement isn't necessarily new, but is growing in popularity as more families acknowledge what they believe to be inherent /f_l aws in the public education system. \"By its very nature, an institution cannot provide personalized learning. It needs policies and procedures that apply to everyone, \" says the mother of /f_i ve Arnall. \"It targets the middle of the spectrum so anyone with special needs or more advanced needs may not get those needs met. \" IS IT LEGAL? The legalities of unschooling in Canada vary from province to province. Alberta is generally perceived as one of the more lenient provinces with regards to home education. Alberta's School Act Home Education Regulation dictates that parents intending to provide a home education program, including unschoolers, must notify an associate school board within the city for each school year and submit a home education plan. The stipulations also require regular evaluation by parents and the associate school board that the home-educated student is registered with. Failure to do so opens up unschoolers to truancy laws and the resulting punishment. \"We are obliged to write two reports a year, \" says Surridge. \"And if we do see that there isn't enough attention being paid or a student is not meeting their goals, we say that very directly in our report. \" Continued on p. 38 General unschooling philosophy values playtime, choice, and experience-based learning over the structure and routine of formal schooling. PHOTO BY MEGAN MACKAY14 MAY/JUNE 2016 CALGARYJOURNAL.CAVOICES Years before he became an author and promoter of humanism and interfaith dialogues, Chris Stedman was volunteering at a community centre in New Haven, Conn. There, a Muslim woman challenged and changed Stedman's beliefs about the conversations believers and non-believers are willing to have. The woman shared with him details of the harassment she received routinely in public while wearing a cloth head covering or hijab. \"I identi/f_i ed in a way with what she was saying because I had also been physically and verbally harassed for being gay while walking out in public, \" says Stedman. \"Without realizing what I was doing, I shared that with her ... I had no idea what her reaction was going to be ... I had all kinds of assumptions about what she would think because she was Muslim. Instead, she really surprised me \u2014 she asked me what it is that I do in those moments when I'm afraid. \" He recalls \"realizing just how much my unwillingness to have those conversations was disrupting my ability to learn, and to be educated. \" He says that when he let go of the stereotypes and prejudices he clung to as an atheist about what others from di erent religions would perceive, he opened himself up to having conversations with others regardless of their beliefs and without fear of judgment. He believes this is how true understanding between people of di erent faiths can be reached. Stedman was involved in the inception of the new atheism movement that addresses the stereotype of the \"militant atheist, \" a term that captures the traditional view of atheism as hostile towards religion, and helped exchange this stigma for a more positive image, one that emphasizes its concern for and involvement in international, political and social activism. \"One thing that interfaith dialogues have is a focus on action rather than just arguing over the issue of whether God exists or not, \" says Steven Engler, religious studies professor at Mount Royal University and North American editor of the academic journal, Religion. \"That's the strength of newer forms of socially committed atheism. They start with the idea that when you have a basic commitment to a certain view of the world, whether it's religious or gets on without religion, the question is what comes next and how do you live your life on the basis of that?\" For Calgarian Christine Shellska, who grew up in a secular household, the atheism community o ered her a place to get involved in social, political and justice causes. \"Getting involved in the atheist community was a catalyst that compelled me to get out there and do stu to make the world a better place, \" says Shellska. \"I had always been interested in social justice but I didn't know how to get involved. \" Now the president of Atheist Alliance International, a global organization of atheists, Shellska had the opportunity to speak at United Nations in New York City last year on behalf of the alliance. This was the /f_i rst time an atheist organization addressed the United Nations. This budding involvement on the world stage takes many forms. For the estranged son of the founder of the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas, Nate Phelps uses his position as an atheist to help others who have lost their faith. \"I still recognize that we're social creatures, and a lot of what religions do is to support that in us, \" he says. \"The meetings, the community, the rituals, weddings, funerals and all that stu , those don't go away because we no longer attach them to some religious component. \" Phelps speaks publicly about his experience leaving the Westboro Baptist Church on the night of his 18th birthday to provide support for others who have left their faiths. As the former director of the Centre for Inquiry's Calgary branch, Phelps is also on the board of Recovering from Religion, a group dedicated to connecting individuals who have left their faith with resources, support and community. After renouncing his belief in God, Mount Royal University business student, Jason Droboth was shunned by his family and friends. Droboth says that Jehovah's Witnesses practice mandatory shunning, which prevents them from associating with an apostate. \"They truly believe that is the best and most loving way for them to behave, to completely shun their own children, \" says Droboth who was exiled from his community at the age of 18. \"It was extremely di cult and extremely dangerous as well because I had no family or friends. Everything was cut away from me overnight essentially and I was in no mental state to be able to stand on my own two feet. \" As an atheist, Droboth created a secular community similar to the one he grew up with. In 2014, Droboth founded Mount Royal University's Secular Humanist Society to engage in \"rationale discussions\" and encourage the free exchange of ideas at their movie screenings and \"Pint with a Prof\" events. He says the group's membership replaced the family and friends he lost when he rejected his belief in God. Today, new atheist groups give non-religious individuals a sense of community and the opportunity to be engaged in politics, public policy, social justice and human rights causes, areas traditionally associated with religious groups. \"I realized what I sought from the religious community was activism, not faith, \" Stedman says.

According to the Ecology Global Network, 105 people die each minute. There are a myriad of reactions to death. Some /f_i nd it mysterious while others /f_i nd it terrifying. When loved ones die, re/f_l ection and mourning typically follow. At such times, it's natural to ask: Is there an afterlife? Will I go there one day? Many /f_i nd solace in the answers religion provides. Unfortunately, these answers contradict each other in many cases. Yet, for the faithful there is no question what happens in the afterlife. It's a settled issue. But for those who are less certain, the question of what happens when you die remains unanswered. In an e ort to inform our readers and explore di ering conceptions of the afterlife, The Calgary Journal asked seven experts to weigh in. Yet the mystery of what happens after death remains just that, a mystery. As English novelist George Eliot wrote, \"Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them. \" That much, at least, we can be certain of. Editor's Note: The Calgary Journal understands there are a great multitude of religions worldwide, and therefore many conceptions of the afterlife. The following interviews are by no means representative of the world's great diversity of religious belief. The Calgary Journal did not include mainstream Christian conceptions of the afterlife because most Canadian readers are already familiar with these concepts.

On a scale of 1-10 how certain areyour beliefs?Why do you .16Geshe Lharampa Trinly Gyatso Buddhist Monk Jam Tse Cho Ling Tibetan Buddhist Temple 1. When we die you go into an intermediary state called the Bardu. There you will stay for up to 49 days depending on your karma. After your stay in the Bardu you are reborn as one of six types of beings. Three of these are higher states and three are lower. The three lower beings are hell beings, hungry ghost beings and animal beings. The higher beings include humans, demi-gods and gods. 2. Your actions of the past create your karma. This karma affects how quickly you move through the Bardu and whether or not you are reborn into a fortunate or less fortunate being. There are numerous ways to create good or bad karma, which depend on your actions. 3. I was born into the faith and have been studying Buddhism for 24 year. I spent time studying in one of the three great monasteries in India called Sera. Buddhism is not all about belief. One has to use reasoning and logic to investigate the teachings. I have found that happiness lies in helping others find happiness. 4. Extremely certain. 10 out of 10.Russell Jayne Cantor Beth Tzedek Congregation 1. There is a soul. It's an immortal part of us that lives on after our earthly bodies cease to function. Jews have an idea of an afterlife, however it is not particularly well defined. The soul goes back to God from where it came, and becomes a part of the afterlife with God and the great divine. The Jewish faith doesn't put a lot of emphasis on what the afterlife holds because what's more important for us is how someone lives here on earth. 2. No, not conditional. Unlike other religions we believe that the afterlife is available to all. 3. It's the most realistic way of looking at the world. It's wonderful because you don't need to have people that stand in between you and God. Everyone has access understanding God and the great divine. It's wonderful and practical when it comes to being able to talk to God, and through talking to God understanding what He wants. I personally can't think of another belief that truly directs me through my day and keeps God at the forefront on my mind. 4. Somewhere between 7-10 because no human can be absolutely certain of something as all encompassing of our religious beliefs.Bob Hamilton Temple RecorderCalgary Mormon Temple 1. Within our body we have a spirit, and the body ceases to function but the spirit will continue to live on. 2.

Death is something that is mentioned in scripture and in prophetic tradition, and not only as Muslims but as human beings, we believe that the only certain thing in life is death, but the most uncertain thing in life is the time of death. We've ascribed to the fact that when God wills for us to pass away, that is the time we will inevitably pass away. There are verses in the Quran that say 'When the time of death approaches, no one can delay that moment by a second, no one can advance that moment by a second as well. That's why in the Quran God says, 'every soul will taste death. ' He mentions this three times just to emphasize that this world is a place of temporariness. 2. Depending on what we do in this world, and if we leave this world in a better place than how we found it, then we will be deserving of God's grace, mercy and forgiveness hereafter. God has created everyone's soul already and depending on when he wishes to blow that soul into a human body, he will blow it into the human body when he wills. Then, we are in the Wombs of our Mothers; then we're in the world we are living in; and then between death and Heaven and Hell, the Day of Judgement, there's a place called, bahasa. It's the time between you dying and the Day of Judgement. You are judged according to how you've lived in this world, and then you go to Heaven or Hell. 3. Specific verses in the Quran (Ch. 3 v. 185; Ch. 3 v. 734; Ch. 101 v. 11; Ch. 67 v. 2) 4. Extremely certain. 10 out of 10.Ghena Girleanu Pastor at the Calgary Central Seventh-Day Adventist Church 1. At first, death is like sleeping. It's a temporary state until Jesus resurrects you. 2. What happens next is conditional. You must accept Jesus as your saviour. The saved will initially spend 1,000 years in heaven with Christ before returning to earth. The lake of fire will consume and destroy the sinful. The conditions are that you must accept Christ. If you do not, you will be destroyed. 3. My grandmother passed away. I wondered if he'd ever be reunited. I researched the scriptures and decided the Seventh-day Adventist doctrine was the truth. 4. Extremely certain. 10 out of 10.Claudia Orr Minister at the Gateway Centre - Calgary Spiritualist Church 1. Everyone is entitled to his or her own views. There is no dogma or creed in spiritualism, but I personally believe the body transitions from corporeal to spiritual form. Physically, emotionally and personality wise, we will be the exactly the same as when we die. Then we change over time. Eventually, we become more energy and thought. The body fades away. 2. Not conditional at all. Even a mass murderer can cross over and he or she is still going to what we call heaven. In the afterlife you associate with your own kind and then you get educated and learn how to change for the better. It's all about education and learning. There's no judgment about anything that happened in this life or the previous life. 3. I came to spiritualism after my sister was ill and passed to spirit. It's a knowingness and it just resonates well with me. 4. Extremely certain. 10 out of 10.SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTSPIRITUALIST SUNNIMUSLIM SECULAR HUMANIST James Linville Professor of Religious Studies University of Lethbridge 1. I suspect that consciousness just disappears and that's pretty much it. I don't subscribe to any notion of the soul. I don't really have any evidence against it, but I just have a complete lack of evidence for it. But some people can find a sense of immortality in their children. 2. Your legacy is conditional. Whether or not people remember you fondly really depends on how you have lived your life. 3. Other beliefs just didn't seem to be satisfying. The more I studied religious societies and cultures around the world, the more I realized just how historically contingent the whole process is. 4. Not entirely certain. 9 out of 10.It's no secret that today's world is becoming increasingly digital. People own more digital assets than ever before, including, photographs, music, books, and even currency. Understanding how to properly manage these assets when a person dies can be confusing because policies vary widely from company to company. Marissa German is an associate at McLeod Law LLP , and has written articles such as \"Digital Asset Estate\" Planning for Wealth Matter. She says that digital assets can carry di erent types of value ranging from monetary to sentimental and reputational values. \"I don't think that people really think about their Hotmail account, or their Facebook account, or their Twitter account, or YouTube account as having value, but they certainly do, even if it's not monetary, \" German explains.German recommends that people give power to their executor to speci/f_i cally manage their digital assets. This provides companies with the certainty the executor is authorized to deal with the digital assets. \"Review the terms of the service contracts, \" says German. \"All of these di erent service providers have di erent service contracts, and they all have di erent provisions as to what happens on death. \" SOCIAL MEDIA Facebook has two di erent options that can either allow the pro/f_i les of the deceased to be turned into memorial pages, or they can be removed completely at the request of a family member or an executor of the estate. Twitter will remove the pro/f_i le of a deceased user at the request of the executor or a veri/f_i ed family member upon receiving a copy of the death certi/f_i cate, as well as any further information they may require, such as valid ID from the person who requests the removal. Additionally, in certain circumstances Twitter will remove imagery of those who have passed away out of respect for loved ones. However, they may refuse to remove such images if they are considered to be in the public's interest. Instagram's Privacy Policy simply states to contact them in the event that a user passes away, and they will communicate primarily via email. LinkedIn requires several smaller actions in order to close the account of a deceased person. These include: the name of the person who passed away, the URL for the pro/f_i le of the deceased, the relationship of the deceased and the requester, their email, the death date, a link to an obituary, and the company that they most recently worked at. EMAIL Google's Gmail (as well as other Google accounts including Google+, Google Drive, Pictures etc.) can be managed through something that they call Inactive Account Manager. This allows users to name someone who has authority to manage your Google accounts if for any reason your account should become inactive for a period of time. It also gives users the option to delete all data from the account if it is inactive for a certain period of time. It is extremely difficult to gain access to the deceased's Google accounts without these permissions. Microsoft's Outlook has a Next-of-Kin process to help the family members of those who have passed away. Upon giving them the required details, they will release Outlook.com content, including emails and attachments, on a DVD that will be shipped to the next-of-kin. MUSIC, MOVIES, APPS & E-BOOKS Every time consumers purchase a song, an app, a movie on iTunes, or an e-book for Kindle, he or she is not really purchasing the content. Instead they are licensing it from Apple or Amazon for personal use only. Unfortunately, this means that the consumer cannot legally will these products to someone else. \"This is an area where people are not really aware about these issues, and how to handle it. It's something where the law is not really catching up with what's actually happening due to the advances in technology, \" says German. SOME THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND According to German, it's a good idea to leave your passwords in one location, such as a safety deposit box that your executor might have access to, and leave your log-on IDs in another location so that your accounts cannot be easily accessed. This is the easiest way to give your executor access to your online accounts, as well as providing specific authority in the will. However, it is important to use some caution when giving passwords and login information to others. \"All of these service providers have their contracts where if someone other than the account user accesses the account, or 'ghosts' and logs on as that person the account could be shut down, \" says German. 18 MAY/JUNE 2016 CALGARYJOURNAL.CATHE AFTERLIFE Dying in a digital world nholland@cjournal.ca NATALIE HOLLANDHow to manage your digital assets before you die GRAPHICAL ILLUSTRATION BY JESSE YARDLEYCALGARYJOURNAL.CA MAY/JUNE 2016 19THE AFTERLIFE Breathe in. You're walking along a dark hallway, feet treading softly against the cobblestone, creating a tiny echo as you move. At the end of a tunnel there is a door with a bright light. Breathe out. You walk towards the light, apprehensive with what might lie beyond, the unknown of who you might have been and the answers you may uncover. This can be the beginning of a \"past life regression\" (PLR). WHAT IS A PAST LIFE REGRESSION? Past life regression is a spiritual therapy method used by a practitioner or \"regressionist\" who often has accreditations for PLR and other holistic therapies, such as hypnosis, reiki, meditation and shamanic therapies. PLR can be hypnotic or non-hypnotic. There are arguments about which is better. Some claim the hypnotic form is suggestive, with the regressionist leading the client; while other documentation states, if you're not hypnotized during a regression your conscious mind conjures explanations for a problem in your life, thus developing incomplete or wrong conclusions. Many use past life regression to aid emotional, physical and spiritual problems. Some practitioners will strongly recommend having a speci/f_i c problem or question you want answered. \"Do it only if you have a problem or question otherwise the regression can be confusing. A regression is all about /f_i nding answers and letting go of problems. If you had a negative experience and you don't release it, it can become embedded in your consciousness, which can cause a negative after e ect, \" says Daniela Hills, a local regressionist. Other regressionists leave it open to explore so the session unfolds organically. Alishia Alibhai, a regressionist who has undergone PLR herself, recommends this method. \"I might have had speci/f_i c questions for answers I wanted or healing I wanted to address but even when I haven't and I have gone into a PLR, it's always the most relevant thing in my life at the time that surfaces in the past life, \" she explains. Regardless, Hills says there is a lot to be learned from PLR. \"I've learned that we are all the same actually, we all have our own problems and struggles and the reason for this could maybe come from a past life, \" she says. \"We all have experiences from the past and that's why we are who we are. Because of this I've learned that we should not judge other people. \" WHY PEOPLE SEEK PLR? The main reason most people seek out a PLR is curiosity. They want to learn more about it or something identi/f_i es with them and the questions or problems they have. Can the now be explained by the past? A look at past life regression therapy kholowaty@cjournal.ca KATE HOLOWATY Another reason can be that they didn't get the answers they wanted elsewhere, or didn't feel satis/f_i ed trying other holistic strategies. For others, they explore PLR because they feel their experiences with traditional medicine haven't worked, or they want to use PLR in conjunction with their current treatment. WHO CAN USE IT? Anyone who is open minded can participate in PLR, but practitioners recommend not participating if you are skeptical. A PLR is not like Long Island Medium where a skeptic can go to try to prove the regressionist wrong. A true session relies heavily on the client's participation, and without an open mind, it simply will not work. LEADING AND QUESTION/hyphen.capBASED PLR Faith Wood, a hypnotist, blogger and speaker, gives an example of leading versus question-based PLR. \"'You are standing in sandals, you are standing in the Sahara Desert' \u2014 those are 'leading conversations' versus, 'Where are you? Are you inside or outside? When you look down what do you see? When you look around what do you see?' We invite the participant to be able create the picture as opposed to the therapist creating the picture, \" she explains. In a hypnotic session the practitioner will tell you to visualize certain scenarios and then will lull you into a hypnotic state through deep breathing and relaxation. Often, a hypnotic session will have more guidance from the practitioner, whereas in a non-hypnotic PLR session, the client is considered a co-facilitator and maintains conscious control to chose what he or she wants to remember and relive. THE PROCESS: WHAT TO EXPECT Both processes di er depending on the practitioner, but it's paramount to feel comfortable and safe with the regressionist conducting your session. Sessions can cost over $500. Before the session begins, you will typically speak over the phone to the practitioner and then at length in person before you o cially begin the session. This is necessary to build rapport and trust, which helps support a successful session. Then it's time for the session to begin. Many practitioners will ask you to prepare a list of questions they can ask during the session. There should be a comfortable chair or couch to lie down on or even a bed with a pillow and blanket. Next the regressionist uses relaxation techniques to ease you. You'll close your eyes and the practitioner will either guide you or let you lead the way into your session. The session can take up to /f_i ve hours, depending on where the client goes and what he or she uncovers. If the root of a problem is found, the regressionist will try to neutralize it using his or her preferred technique. Some regressionists may ask you to relive the experience a few times until it no longer is troublesome or some may say that simply seeing it once is enough. Hills explains what it's like to go through a past death. \"The death experience is important in order to let go of your problem. You may think this is scary, but it's just like a memory. Maybe you will remember the pain, but it's more like feeling the emotions connected to this experience. After the death experience you will feel light and free, knowing the problem is gone, \" says Hills. Daniela Hills takes notes as she shows what a past life regression would look like on her daughter Mira.

New green-conscious funeral practices gain popularity in Canada and o er families personal memorial services. DYING GREEN Canadian artist, Audrey McGrath was the /f_i rst Canadian to re-ceive a natural burial at a designated cemetery. McGrath died at age 89 in Victoria, and was buried after Royal Oak Burial Park opened its woodland burial area in November 2008. \"She was buried in a wicker casket wearing her kilt, \" says Lor- raine Fracy, manager of client services at Royal Oak Burial Park. \"Her family used to tease [her saying] she used to love her laundry basket, so the wicker casket was deemed to be very /f_i tting for her. \" Fracy, who was present during the artist's burial, says it was monumental because it established a precedent for subsequent burials at the park. And this is true for the learning process that's occurring amongst providers at most natural burial sites across Canada. This eco-revolution of sustainable death practices is slowly reforming contemporary burial practices and enabling people to remain environmentally conscious even in death.REQUIREMENTS OF NATURAL BURIAL The Natural Burial Association, Canada's /f_i rst not-for-pro/f_i t certi/f_i er founded in 2005, de/f_i nes natural burial as a green alternative based on typical natural burial practices including: According to the Green Burial Council's website this ensures \"conservation of natural resourc- es, reduction of carbon emissions, protection of worker health, and the restoration and/or preservation of habitat. \" Industry professionals report that these qualities of natural burial appeal to \"green\" individuals who like the idea that their eco-footprint contributes to new life after death. This \"green\" trend brought modern natural burial to Canada, a movement that is already wide- spread across Europe. Today there are over 300 natural burial sites in the United Kingdom, but there are only six natural burial sites recognized in Canada. But natural burial isn't new. These ways of caring for the dead and their internment were standard practice before the growth of the funeral service industry, which responded to urbanization and the need for convenient and sanitary disposal of human remains. This is also similar to the doctrine of many re-ligions that dictate how the dead should be cared for. Jewish, Muslim and Indigenous funeral practices don't allow for the body of their deceased to be em-balmed. Individuals from these religious traditions still prac- tice these burial rituals today. Natural burial is a movement that started in British Columbia and migrated east to Ontario. It began taking root in early-2000, but remains a slow process. \"The provinces have strict rules about what happens to dead people, \" says Michael de Pencier, a renowned magazine publisher and founder of the Natural Burial Association. The Government of Alberta requires cem-eteries to meet the regulations of the Cemeteries Act. Louise Bell, a former local politician, experienced the challenges of creating a natural burial site on Denman Island, B.C. when she established the Denman Island Memorial Society in 2009 to address the town's limited burial space. The island's existing cemetery sold its last burial rights in the 1970s. Bell says this scarcity of burial space posed problems for the island community of 1,000 residents. \"There were a few incidents in the 1990s and both times it was children who died, where people actu-ally gave up their internment rights so they could be buried on the island, \" she says. This began a six-year initiative that led to Canada's /f_i rst and only exclusive natural burial cemetery. While many cemeteries like Union Cemetery in Cobourg, Ont., Meadowvale Cemetery in Brampton, Ont., Du n Meadows Cemetery in Pickering, Ont. and Royal Oak Burial Park in Victoria o er green burial options, many of these spaces are small and don't exceed one-acre in size. of Mount Pleasant Group of Cemeteries that runs the Meadowvale and Du n Meadows Cemeteries in Ontario. \"We've taken it on our shoulders to make sure that we're watching what is going on in the industry around the world to see if there is something we should bring because there might be a demand for them, \" he says. \"We thought it might be an opportuni-ty to put something in that might add another choice that would be favourable to a portion of the popula-tion. We had no idea how many. \" While not all cemeteries agree on what constitutes a natural burial, two organizations, the Natural Burial Association (founded in 2005) and the Natural Burial Society of Canada (established in 2013), are attempt-ing to form a national consensus of certi/f_i cation standards, and provide a Canadian alternative to the largest American certi/f_i er, the Natural Burial Council. \"It's been a colourful experience, \" says Bell who nev- er imagined moving from her government position as a Denman Island Trustee to managing the island's memorial society. Others, like environmental architect, Erik Lees and Fracy echo this. Both speak of the learning process their industries have gone through to o er natural burial options to consumers. HISTORICAL AND RELIGIOUS CONTEXT CHALLENGES OF 'GOING GREEN' HOW NATURAL BURIAL ORIGINATED IN CANADA These options are relatively new and not necessar- ily driven by demand because not many people are aware of this, says Glenn McClary, presidentChoosing not to embalm the body because embalming /f_l uids are usually toxic and can leach into the soil.Containing the body in biodegradable materials such as a shroud or a casket without varnishes or metal /f_i ttings that won't decompose.Removing the use of tombstones to ensure the natural state of the land remains undisturbed after the burial. But this hasn't been easy. Although Kate Kalanick, executive director of the Natural Burial Council believes awareness is growing at the same rate in Canada as the U.S., local natural burial providers still say it is early days for their industry. \"No one knows about it, and older people tend to have already made their plans, \" says De Pencier. \"And when you talk to young people, especially 'greens, ' they're all /f_i red up about it and say, 'great idea, but I don't have to worry about that for 30 to 40 years. '\" This is re/f_l ected in Mount Pleasant Group's sales at their natural burial sites at Meadowvale Cemetery in Brampton, Ont. and Du n Meadows Cemetery in Pickering, Ont. McClary says since the sites' openings in 2012 and 2013 they have sold 47 plots between the two sites. Meadowvale Cemetery has the capacity for 250 graves and Du n Meadows can accommodate 330 graves, yet only a small number have sold. \"The target clientele for a cemetery company is 60 plus and there's interest amongst many of those, but again it's the minority, \" McClary says. \"My gut says this is going to be more interesting and much more in de-mand with the younger generation as they approach old age. Today they're just too far away from that where purchasing cemetery plots and thinking about death isn't something on their minds. \" But for right now Lees says, \"no one is asking for the service because they don't know about it and it's not available. So until it's available and people know about it the industry won't take o . \" Many in the bereavement sector believe in natural burial and want it to be available so the aging popu-lation can choose environmentally sustainable death practices. \"We're in the forever business, \" says McClary. With all options facing di erent challenges, there are currently two types of natural burial cemeteries available in Canada. Hybrid cemeteries have the largest presence, with /f_i ve of the six natural burial sites falling into this category. This refers to a cemetery that o ers both conventional and natural burial options. Denman Island Natural Burial Cemetery Conserva- tion is the /f_i rst and only natural burial conservation cemetery in Canada. Seven years ago, when Denman Island Memorial Society began looking for land, the lo-cal conservancy covenant donated nearly three acres of land in the corner of the conservation park to the cemetery to build a natural burial cemetery that aligns with the tenants of developing on conservation land. \"Eventually there will be a forest in the cemetery, \" says Bell because the land must remain undisturbed after the graves are /f_i lled to ensure the regeneration of the vegetation and return the land to its natural state. Lees architectural /f_i rm, Lees and Associates, is cur-rently involved in creating the master plan for the new City of Calgary cemetery located near Ralph Klein Park. He says these new plans may consider natu-ral burial. If they do, this would bring the /f_i rst natural burial cemetery to Alberta. 21 THE YOUNGER GENERATION SOCIAL ASPECTS OF NATURAL BURIAL Another feature of natural burial is the social aspect. \"Conventional funeral services took away from families the whole process of dealing with after death, \" says Bell. She says that the social component of natural burial is something that ap-peals to her community. \"The ceremony associated with green burial is much more involved, \" says Lees. \"The family is much more active... right down to being actively involved in the burial process itself. \" This is a distinctive feature of natural burial. Cemeteries like Royal Oak Burial Park and Denman Island Natural Burial Conservation Cemetery o er an array of community gatherings. This includes artists in residence, night for all souls, solstice parties and other community events that involve the arts. \"This has transformed how people think about death, \" says Fracy. \"Memori-alization is not a temporary thing. \" While most natural burial cemeteries don't allow families to purchase plots side-by-side like conventional ceme-teries in order to preserve the land and also don't permit individual markers, like tombstones, Fracy says these com-munity events are ways for families to connect with their loved ones. Three years after Isaac Potash and Jennifer Large buried their four-year-old daughter Lola, they returned to her plot at Royal Oak Burial Park. But this wasn't a solemn a air. According to Fracy, who arranged for the Kelowna, B.C. family of organic farmers to bury their daughter naturally at the park 500 kilometres away in Victoria, the family returned to honour their daughter by placing a row of sun/f_l owers over her grave that was adorned with vegetation. \"It was a beautiful scene and way to remember Lola, surrounded by nature, \" says Fracy. Other memorialization opportunities, like Royal Oak Burial Park's Summer So(u)lstice event, which includes music, poets and spirit /f_l ags where families can write letters to their loved ones, makes the memorialization experience person-al, communal and creates a celebratory atmosphere.

But can people really increase their life expectancy just by decreasing the amount of food they eat? When practicing caloric restriction people cut out close to all processed foods and consume a diet primarily consisting of vegetables, fruit, healthy fats and lean proteins, including beans and lentils. As for liquids, they drink a lot of water, tea and black co ee. A sample breakfast for a six-foot tall, 180-pound, man at age 25, who does a moderate amount of activity is two slices of whole wheat toast with two tablespoons of peanut butter, a cup of skim milk, one orange, and tea or co ee with two tablespoons of milk and one teaspoon of sugar. A sample lunch for a 25-year-old woman who stands at 5-7 and weighs 150 pounds is two cups of mixed greens with two tablespoons of low-fat dressing, three ounces of grilled salmon, half of a whole wheat pita and one cup of non-fat yogurt.But dieticians are skeptical about how realistic CR is for most people, saying it's much harder to maintain than people think. Some dieticians also say people may not approach CR with the right intentions for their own health and can even use the notion of CR to mask an eating disorder. Patricia Chuey, a registered dietician and nutrition author, says when considering CR people need to consider the quality versus quantity aspect of their new lifestyle. \"Most people aren't just after, 'I want to live to be 100, '\" Chuey explains. \"I think if you ask people if they would rather have 90 good quality healthy years or would they rather live to 100 but the last 20 years of their life are awful, I would say most people are after quality. \" This de/f_i nition of \"quality of life\" is di erent for everyone. For some, it may include enjoying the social aspects that come with food but Andrea Hardy, a registered dietician based in Calgary, believes social limitations can be an issue when practicing CR. \"You're limited in what you're going to be allowing yourself to attend, like family gatherings and meals, \" Hardy says. \"So it's just kind of weighing what sort of life you're willing to live and what brings you the most j o y.\" But studies have shown that intermittent fasting is another and potentially easier eating plan option, adds Hardy. \"With CR generally you're taking in about about 60 to 80 per cent of the calories that you need for a day, whereas the intermittent fasting would be a feast day and a fast day, \" she explains. \"A lot of studies have chosen to do it this way in humans because they're hypothesizing that we would /f_i nd it easier to not eat for an entire day and then eat whatever we wanted for an entire day versus counting calories every single d ay.\" Since the 1930s multiple, long-term studies have found that lab rats and mice live up to 40 per cent longer when eating a diet that is reduced by 30 per cent. Yet other studies have concluded that the age the mice and rats start CR has an impact on the plan's e cacy. Caloric restriction requires a high level of commitment and will power. This may explain the reason why all three registered dieticians who spoke with The Calgary Journal do not have anyone currently practicing CR under their guidance. But that's not to say people haven't asked about CR. Jessica Begg, a registered dietician says she's experienced people who match the criteria for disordered eating come to her with the latest study in hand supporting caloric restriction. \"They are trying to support their stance, \" she says. \"They say that these studies show if you restrict you will live longer but there already is a whole host of things going wrong with them and they clinically have an eating disorder so this is an argument they are using. \" But for those exploring CR for the right reasons and health bene/f_i ts, although Begg doesn't personally recommend CR, and she strongly advises seeking medical supervision or nutritional guidance to ensure one you are consuming the right amount of nutrients. \"You are going to want to make sure you are getting as much nutrition out of [CR], so as much micronutrients and macronutrients in as little as you are going to eat I think that would be the biggest issue, \" Begg says. If someone improperly practices CR, in the long- term they could run the risk of several health problems, says Hardy. \"With these people who are CR for the rest of their lives, they're likely to be underweight, they're likely to probably have a lower bone density and less muscle mass, \" she says. \"So are those extra /f_i ve to 10 years they get, are they in health or are they in illness because they're malnourished?\" Whether you think you have what it takes to do CR, the key to remember is balance, honouring your body and doing it for sound reasons that match your lifestyle. \"There are people out there who can do this and do it successfully and do it for what they believe to be the right reasons, \" says Hardy. \"They're doing it for longevity or they're doing it for their diabetes. \"If you're doing it for weight loss I wouldn't recommend it. \" Chuey, author and dietician, believes the issue in choosing to adopt a CR plan or not \"has to be interpreted individually. And individually is not just based on genetics, but it's based on your core philosophy, who you are and how you want to live your life. \"Reduce, restrict, live forever Caloric restriction 'immortality' more complex than just decreasing your food intake kholowaty@cjournal.ca KATE HOLOWATY 25 YEAR OLD MALECUPS OF LIQUIDS 80 KGS 25 YEAR OLD FEMALE68 KGS1800 1600RECOMMENDED RECOMMENDED CALORIES CALORIES CALORIES CALORIES REDUCTIONREDUCTION2100 2400 25%25% CUPS OF LIQUID8 -10 8 -10 Jessica Begg, a registered dietician, provided The Calgary Journal with these numbers for a CR diet, which is based on a 25 per cent reduction of a normal daily intake.

But for one restaurant owner bike lanes have meant a loss of business. Over 12,500 bicycle trips are logged daily in and out of the downtown, which is a 122 per cent increase since 1996 according to the City of Calgary's website. More cycling lanes have been constructed over the last few months to provide Calgarians with more transportation choices downtown. New lanes can be seen on 5th Street S.W, 12th Avenue and 8th/9th Avenue. But more cycling lanes means fewer parking spaces, and the owner of the restaurant Buchanan's located on 3rd Avenue S.W is unhappy with losing the parking spaces his customers used to have access to. \"The moment you can't park in front of a business it makes you less inclined to go there, and we lost 11 parking spots when the bike lane went in on our block that were directly in front of my restaurant, \" Michael Buchanan says. The manager of Mirchi restaurant, Love Preet, can relate to Buchanan. Similarly arguing that the cycle lanes have hurt the restaurant's business due to the amount of people that can park outside the restaurant. \"It is a ecting our business right now, \" says Preet. \"We had parking in front of our restaurant before and now we don't have any parking so it's like there are no customers with cars right now. \" Cyclist Marcus Steldman uses the bike lanes downtown every week and believes that having dedicated lanes for people to commute using their bikes should only be seen as a positive. \"People are going to ride their bikes regardless, I think the [cycle] lanes just change the amount of people who choose to ride, but the bike lanes make traveling so much safer for all involved, cyclists and drivers. \" Researchers at Portland State University found that customers who arrive by bike spend 24 percent more money in convenience stores, bars and restaurants per month than those who arrive by car. Although cyclists spent less per trip, they visited more often than those using their vehicle. There are no stats on whether Calgary bike riders spend more than their car driving neighbours, and Buchanan argues that the potential of a cyclist spending more per month is less important to his business than having parking options close at hand. Buchanan believes that the cycle lanes have a ected the number of people that dine at his restaurant in a negative way, ultimately a ecting the amount of business that he does. \"The massive headache I would say far outweighs the fact that potentially a cyclist will spend 20 percent more than a person driving their car. \" Not all businesses feel that the cycle lanes are an inconvenience. Several owners and managers contacted by the Calgary Journal say that they have no opinion on the lanes being situated in front of their buildings with some being in favour of the lanes. Lanah Kim, the owner of a Great Clips salon who has also lost parking spaces due to the cycle lanes says that the bike lanes have made the roads a little more congested, but she has not seen any decline in the amount of people that stop by her business. \"Sometimes they [customers] don't know where to park the car, but I think that there is only a little bit of damage [volume of customers visiting the salon] actually. It is not noticeable, \" says Kim. Buchanan says that although he sees the lack of parking as the main issue with the lanes in front of his restaurant it is not the only problem. The business owner says that the cycle lanes have changed the flow of the road due reducing the street to a one-way system. \"It just increases tra c coming out of there because now it is one-lane, one-way street rather than a two-lane, two-way street like it used to be. So it is just everything about it, it is congestion. It is hard to get in and out of our restaurant and everyone here knows it. \" \"There is a solid amount of regulars that come in and complain about it everyday, \" Buchanan says. Jeremy Britt, drives in the downtown area everyday for work and says that the cycle lanes make downtown driving a nightmare at times. \"Driving here [in the downtown area] can be congested enough, the bike lanes just make driving downtown a lot more awkward, \" says Britt. \"Personally I think that having the lanes could be a good idea, but they [cyclists] are given too much room. \" Britt agrees with Buchanan that the lanes have had a big impact on roads, but the number of people that utilize the lanes doesn't warrant the changes taking place. \"I see lot of lanes with even more being constructed and not a whole lot of people using them, \" Britt says. \"Don't get me wrong there are many people using the lanes, but I don't think enough people are using them to justify how many drivers are inconvenienced. \" Buchanan arguing that the City is \"mostly just catering to a mass of minority. \" However, it does not seem that people against the cycle lanes will be placated anytime soon. According to the City of Calgary's website they are planning more cycle lanes with the goal to become a \"bike friendly city. \" With the vision of becoming one of the premier cycling cities in North America in the future.agrant@cjournal.ca ASHLEY GRANT Cyclists pass Buchanan's using the cycle lane that cost the restaurant 11 parking spaces. PHOTO BY ASHLEY GRANT \"The bike lanes make traveling so much safer for all involved, cyclists and drivers. \" -Marcus Steldman24 MAY/JUNE 2016 CALGARYJOURNAL.CACYCLING Changing Gears Calgary's experiment with bike only lanes seems to be working Popularity of the Calgary bicycle lanes is at an all time high. According to the city of Calgary's bike statistics, between June and November of 2015 388,000 bike trips were calculated at three of the city's 13 downtown counting stations. Ultimately, that means a 95 per cent increase in daily trips being made on bicycles compared to the previous year. Of these cyclists, 97 per cent are aged 18-65 and 27 per cent of those same users are women. A University of Calgary professor with an interest and specialization in urban design says that the newly created bike lanes are an important addition to the options that Calgary o ers for commuting. \"Cycling commuting is a way to reduce energy consumption and get people out of cars, \" said Graham David Livesey. \"Anything the city can do to improve commuting for cyclists, especially in the summer months, is a great thing to do, and that's obviously what they're trying to do with these bike lanes. \" The cycling strategy for Calgary was fully completed in June of 2011 and stated that the city was looking to develop a comprehensive cycling strategy, conduct a safety review of the existing pathway system, and bring forward these reports to the Standing Policy Committee of city council. The result of the process was the creation of cycling track system comprised of an interconnected series of bike only lanes downtown. The success of this plan is measured by the number of people cycling, the expansion of cycling infrastructure, safety issues and overall satisfaction with cycling in the city. \"We have a strategy to increase cycling as a means of transportation, \" said Ward 11 councillor Brian Pincott. \"Not just as a means of recreation, but a means of transportation. \" Pincott also believes that the development of the cycle lanes downtown has had a positive impact in increasing the amount of transportation that takes place on the cycling tracks. \"The cycle track downtown has just been a huge boost to cycling in the core, \" said Pincott \"Before you have the ability to get to the edge of downtown in not a bad way if you were a cyclist but once you got to the edges of downtown, most people looked at it like taking your life in your hands. \" Before the lanes were incorporated all Calgary had were pathway systems throughout the city including along the Bow River, which is the most popular area for cyclists according to city statistics. \"On one hand we have this amazing pathway system with several hundred kilometres of dedicated path, which I understand is one of the most comprehensive pedestrian and bike path systems in North America, \" said Livesey. \"(But) if you're not well connected into that bike system, cycling throughout most the city can be rather hair raising. \" Cities like Amsterdam and Minneapolis, which like Calgary is a winter city, have been applauded for their e orts to incorporate bike lanes into public roads and for taking steps to ensure that citizens are both safe and want to use the lanes. This is an area where Livesey believes that Calgary falters and says that his son, a competitive cyclist, has had a fair share of problems while cycling in the city.\"He /f_i nds that a lot of drivers aren't aware or aren't very sympathetic to cyclists, \" said Livesey. \"There is a question of whether you need dedicated bike lanes or whether people just have to know how to negotiate between bicycles and people that drive cars. \" Livesey says that he understands why there is a substantial group of people who /f_i nd the bike lanes unnecessary in Calgary because of their costs and inconvenient locations for drivers, especially along 12th Ave. However, he believes we really don't spend that much on cyclists. \"What we spend on cyclists probably would buy you about a hundred meters on an interchange ramp, \" said Livesey. \"We have remarkable road systems that have tremendous capacity and somehow, when you move into the suburban areas, the notion of cyclists and pedestrians gets lost. \" Even the council budget hasn't been completely used up as the costs have only totaled $5.75 million thus far, $1.35 million under the $7.1 million approved back in 2010. Still, the arguments about the loss of parking in the downtown core is a popular argument among both commuters and business owners, something that Livesey also states is \"unfriendly to automobiles in Calgary. \" However, the city of Calgary reported a net increase of 130 parking stalls in the downtown core to supplement the loss of the stalls along bicycle lanes. Along with the infrastructure developed from incorporating the bike lanes into Calgary streets, city council will vote next fall whether to keep the bike lanes or remove them from the city streets based on the evaluation of the usage, safety and other impacts. jbuchholz@cjournal.ca JESSE BUCHHOLZ The Peace Bridge, which opened to the public in March 2012 is the only bridge in Calgary that was constructed to support a large in/f_l ux of cyclists heading to the downtown core.

Last year the City of Calgary counted 6,125 bicycles downtown on an average weekday. This popular mode of transportation has seen an increase in volume along city pathways in the last /f_i ve years. The latest global bike trends are now making their way to Calgary because of cycling's growing popularity. WHERE DO THESE TRENDS START \"The first ideas often come from small bike builders or consumers and the big companies build them up and spread them to a bigger audience, \" says Jens Klotzer, editor of TOUR, Europe's top road bike magazine. Additionally, there are lots of bike shows that occur yearly where forerunner of trends can appear for the general public to know about them. \"Today most trends spread international. Often they start in the U.S. and after one or two years spread to Europe and over the world, \" Klotzer says. LEARNING ABOUT CYCLING TRENDS This cycling season, riders like long-time bike racer and rural road biker, Rob Crooks monitor the latest trends through online feeds, social media and by talking to other cyclists. \"I follow the racing stu in Europe this time of year, and I have some friends in the business, like distributors, so it's a combination of reading up online and talking to some of the subject matter experts, \" he says. But not all these trends are the same. Depending on the style of riding, cyclists gravitate towards different industry trends. For example, Crooks notes some differences between the male and female bike market. \"When you look at the average biker like me who is riding for fitness over pleasure, the go to bike these days would be a carbon type of frame, \" he says. \"Carbon has become a very popular material. \" Crooks explains that these frames are structurally sti but lightweight to enhance your performance because \"the sti ness helps to put power to the wheel, and the lightness helps to get up the hills. \" BIKES DESIGNED FOR WOMEN Since women and men's anatomies are di erent, many women prefer to purchase bikes designed speci/f_i cally for women. \"A big di erence that separates a male bike from female bikes are the seats and handle bars, \" says Jenn Turcott, a local competitive cyclist. She says women also purchase seats with holes in the centre because it encourages air/f_l ow and alleviates pressure on their pelvis, which is typically wider than men's. For this reason, narrower seats, which are usually sold with higher end models, are not designed for women, she says. A bike's aesthetic is another component many women consider when selecting their bikes. Turcott also highlights a difference in branding with female models. \"More bikes are coming out with di erent colours and patterns, \" she says. \"Purple bikes with gold trim, bright blue with green trim, for instance. \" THE TRENDS E-bikes The most popular bike trend for 2016 is \"electrifying. \" The electric bike or \"e-bike\" has received a boom in its popularity. According to an article by Rachel Walker in People for Bikes, this bike has seen an increase in purchases in China and Europe because of its low impact on the environment. Klotzer agrees that electric bikes are a popular trend, but their design isn't new. Walker says the technology behind the e-bike dates back to the early 1900s. Klotzer also says, \"This is a huge trend for a couple of years in Europe but [is] still growing [for urban cyclist]. \" David Seekatz, an employee of Power in Motion, a local bike store says electric bikes can range from $1,000 and $14,000. The higher price point accounts for the integration of the bike's electric motor that is kick started by pedaling, or by placing the rider's thumb on the throttle. The purpose of this design saves you the sweat and muscular stress of propelling a bike that averages 70-80 pounds from its stationary position, says Seekatz. Cargo bikes David White, another cyclist in Calgary, has multiple bikes for various purposes \u2014 mountain biking, highway biking and urban biking. His latest interest is cargo bikes that include a large plastic compartment between the two front wheels to accommodate larger loads. This bike caters to urban cyclists. For White, he is interested in purchasing this bike because he believes it would be a great way to take his grandkids on rides. \"For around town, cargo bikes really seem to be taking o , so people rather than having to pull a trailer with their kids in the back are buying these bee/f_i er bikes that have long racks on the back and the front for the kids to go in... or for picking up groceries. \" Road bikes In recent years, the cycling industry in Calgary has seen an increase in demand for road bikes, with more riders interested in the performance of this product. Klotzer says, what's unique about road bikes is that they're lightweight and aerodynamic. But these race-oriented bikes are changing their design. Manufacturers are now o ering more comfortable frames, adds Klotzer. Disc brakes are another new addition to urban cycle bikes. This type of braking system is bene/f_i cial because it provides maximum speed control and stopping power in wet and muddy conditions. Mountain bikes Electronic features have also made there way into the mountain bike market this year. Mountain bikers are now purchasing electronic shifting \u2014 which is common in high-end road bikes for a few years now \u2014 and allow riders to shift gears with a small electric motor rather than using conventional control levers operated with a cable. According to Klotzer, this feature creates a smoother ride because it improves your control of the bike. 26 MAY/JUNE 2016 CALGARYJOURNAL.CACYCLING The latest bike trends in Calgary sshinkaruk@cjournal.ca SAVAYA SHINKARUKThink globally but cycle locally Pedaling enthusiasts are taking the streets and bike lanes around Calgary and are showcasing their trending bikes in 2016. PHOTO BY SAVAYA SHINKARUKThe city of Calgary, road safety training and cycling advocates collaborate to create solutions for cyclists and drivers to share the road. As the /f_i rst anniversary of the downtown cycle track network approaches, initiatives amongst these groups place safety at the centre. City councillor Brian Pincott says the city has a strategy to increase cycling as a means of transportation. He adds that new infrastructure like the cycle track, which is protected by a physical barrier from moving cars, and bike lanes that have no barriers, are being developed in order to ensure the safety of cyclists when sharing the roads. \"Getting the bike infrastructure out there is kind of the /f_i rst key to increasing bike safety, \" says Pincott. \"As infrastructure is introduced making sure that everybody is aware of what it is, how it works and how to use it will increase safety. \" A cyclist himself, he says although there have been major improvements with cycling accessibility in the city, he prefers to bike in tra c. \"I am a fearless cyclist so I get in tra c and ride with the tra c, \" Pincott boasts. \"I've had some close calls but I have generally take the attitude that I am just another vehicle on the road so I am constantly watching out for drivers. \" \"I have taken the roads because, from a transportation perspective, it has always been the most e cient way to go, in the straight line. The cycling network that we've had has been a little bit more meandering so that's why I have taken the roads. \" The Canadian Automobile Association's website reports that 7,500 Canadian cyclists are seriously injured or killed every year, with most bicycle crashes, collisions and injuries occurring during the afternoon rush hour. Alberta Motor Association's Driver Education manager Ron Wilson has been teaching Calgarians how to drive safely for 25 years. He says cyclist safety is included in most driving education classes. \"It's a necessity, \" explains Wilson. \"Bikes don't have a lot of protection that drivers do so they are vulnerable road users. We have tips for cyclists, a website in our classes there are many topics we cover and we de/f_i nitely cover interacting with cyclists. \" \"If you're going to pass a cyclist change lanes in advance. We teach about opening the door, checking blind spots, and shoulder checking, because lots of times the cyclists can be unseen if someone isn't paying attention, \" he adds. \"Bicycle are road users and have to follow rules, they have rights and responsibilities. Give them lots of room and space and be patient we all share the road. \" The Province of Alberta Tra c Safety Act, the City of Calgary Tra c Bylaw and the City of Calgary Parks and Pathways Bylaw all have legislation in place that states cyclists have all the rights and are subject to all the duties of a motorist. Bicycles are also permitted to be in High Occupancy Vehicles or HOV lanes that buses commonly use. Cycling instructor with Bike Calgary, Kimberly Nelson says the safety aspect of road sharing has improved since she started biking in the city. \"It's de/f_i nitely been better in my anecdotal opinion when I started riding, \" says Nelson. \"There were very few people riding with cars. You would get honked at, yelled at, people would tell you to go ride on the sidewalk, it was tough. \" From 2005 to 2012, there were 2,005 collisions involving bicycles reported in Calgary. Among those reported, 1,344 involved injuries and six resulted in fatalities. Bike Calgary is a non-pro/f_i t advocacy group that works to improve conditions for Calgarians who ride bicycles, and enable those who want to cycle to do so safely, e ciently, and comfortably. It o ers an Urban Cycling Skills course that runs from May to September every year for people who want to learn how to \"vehicularly cycle, \" which means cycling in tra c with cars. Bike Calgary hopes that cyclists will develop good habits to bike safely while sharing the road. Canadian Automobile Association reported that cyclists are more likely to be killed or injured at an intersection or at a location where there are tra c signals or other tra c control signs. \"Years ago when you were given your driver's license no one told you what to do around a bike nobody tells you what to do in bike lanes what the markings on the roads mean, you read the handbook once you take the test and you never really revisit it, \" says Nelson. \"How do you hit that audience in a meaningful way that you put down bike lanes on 10th Ave., and you don't tell anyone what the dash lines means, the signals and stencils and how to interact with those lanes. It's a challenge especially when we have new infrastructure. \" Pincott says cyclists have been the key to making sure that infrastructure is the safest for both cyclists and drivers. \"For all of the planning of the cycle tracks last summer when they are put in we very quickly learned from cyclists that there was one spot that was not designed very well or that was a bit dangerous and so it was very quickly changed. \" And even with what she sees as improvement in safe cycling, Nelson says as the number of lanes and cyclists increase, more will have to be done to improve safety. \"The system is never going to be 100 percent perfect. I think there is de/f_i nitely safety in numbers the more times you see bikes on the road acting as tra c the more you become used to it and accept the movement they are going to make. \" CALGARYJOURNAL.CA MAY/JUNE 2016 27CYCLING Sharing the road Bike safety awareness rising as organizations work with drivers and cyclists ksolway@cjournal.ca KELSEY SOLWAY A cyclist travels on the 8 Ave S.W portion of the downtown cycle track network.

Vincent van Gogh famously sold only one painting during his lifetime. It wasn't until after his suicide that the one-eared artist received recognition. In fact, according to the Baltimore Sun, in 1990 van Gogh set the world record for selling a painting for $82 million. Jackson Pollock is another artist who falls in to this category. Pollock enjoyed a successful career while he was alive, yet it wasn't until after his untimely death that his paintings were held in reverence by the art world. Pollock held a gallery in 1950 with no sales, according to his pro/f_i le on biography.com, yet included in that gallery was his famous piece Number 4, 1950, which is considered a masterpiece today. The Canada House Gallery, situated in Ban , Alberta, displays the paintings of the late Robert Genn, who passed in 2014. Genn spent his career painting in the same style as the world-renowned Group of Seven; painting Canadian landscapes with heavy attention being paid to the use of colour. Rob Surdu, a professor of Art History at Mount Royal University, says that the relationship between the death of an artist and the value of their work is dependent on how you \"break down the stats. \" \"If you're looking at 100 per cent of artists, when they die, is there a correlation to their works going up in value? Probably not. But then at the other extreme, there is a kind of explosion for a few artists, where their work will anything from double, to quadruple, to some kind of astronomical expansion of the value of their work, weather that's monetarily or a critical acclaim that kind of gathers around their work, \" Surdu said. Surdu cited the case of renowned American street artist, Jean Michel Basquiat. Basquiat was a gra ti artist in New York City that was thrust into the mainstream art world, and revered due to his status as an outsider. \"I don't want to suggest this, but the idea circulated in the elite art world that because he was a black, poor American\u2014which he wasn't poor, he came from a fairly middle class family in Brooklyn, as I recall\u2014the art world seized on him as kind of a primitive operating within the art world, \" he said. \"I'm not saying he was a primitive, but they kind of created a romantic hero out of Basquiat as an untrained savage working within the elite art world. \" Basquiat lived a troubled life, abusing heroine until he eventually overdosed and passed in the late 80s. The value, and desire for Basquiat's work has \"skyrocketed following his death, \" said Surdu. Surdu said that Basquiat's posthumous success was due to the \"romantic appeal of the outsider. The drug abuser, you know, a bit naive and died too soon. That story that so many people seem to like in a perverted way. \" Calgary-based artist Lindsay Sorell has an idea of why people romanticize the careers of dead artists. \"After [artists] die they become better, \" said Sorell. She mentioned the term \"apotheosis, \" the elevation of something to divine status. \"It's like suddenly they've become more God-like, or more eternal after they've died. They're no longer /f_l awed physical beings. Now they can exist /f_l awlessly in your mind. \" Sorell said that she thinks it's natural for humans to want to organize things in a linear fashion, and that extends to the subjects of life and death. \"It's easy to sell a story that is complete. Once you have the start and the end of someone's life, that's like a package that you can sell, \" said Sorell.\"That romantic sensibility is perhaps central to part of this, \" said Surdu. He explained that certain auction houses that sell and resell these pieces of art will \"not only traffic in that kind of romanticism, they exploit it when they're advertising these works of art. That you are in fact grasping a piece of the life of a tortured artist, and it is a kind of exploitation. \" \"I think each of us believes internally that we have a kind of reckless creativity, but it's been quashed by modern life. We all think in some way \"I'm a little bit Pollock. If he knew me we would share something, \" said Surdu. \"It's that kindred spirit phenomenon that we all believe that we have a kind of inner reckless creative genius within us. So we're absolutely attracted to someone who lives their life openly in that way: o the grid, o the way that society constructs is the correct way to live. \" Barbara Pelham, co-owner of the Canada House Gallery says that they have seen an increase in the value of Genn's work, but it hasn't \"skyrocketed. \" The work they have on display has increased at a pace of about 10 per cent per year. Pelham says that the idea of value increasing \"may not necessarily be the reality\" of what occurs when an artist dies. \"The family of the artist may have discussed (the artist's) wishes before they passed, and there might be an arrangement in place to stay the course, and not double the value of paintings overnight, \" said Pelham. \"The family would communicate what their desires are and it's up to the gallery if they want to maintain the good standing in that relationship and honour the artist and the family's wishes. \" How the value of an artist's work can be a ected by his or her death tklinkhammer@cjournal.ca TYLER KLINKHAMMER Vincent van Gogh's painting, Starry Night Above the Rhone, produced in 1888 and is located at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris. PHOTO COURTESY OF LU TIANYU | FLICKRFor 42 years, Old Sun Residential School outlawed Blackfoot culture, traditions and language. Children who clung to their heritage were strictly punished. Today, in the very building where she was once forbidden to speak her native tongue, Vivian Ayoungman has developed a mobile app to teach students the Blackfoot language, and help students reclaim their cultural roots. \"Those of us that went through did not forget the language, we did not lose it here, \" says Ayoungman. \"But when our people left here and had children of their own, they say I don't want my child to suffer what I went through so they just speak English to them. \" Both Ayoungman and her mother are residential school survivors who were tormented for speaking their native Blackfoot language, but see the importance and value in preserving this language, despite the abuse. Today, Ayoungman works as an educator at Old Sun Community College. Once a place where language and culture were forbidden, the community college now offers an indigenized and Blackfoot specific curriculum. Ayoungman chose a mobile app platform to build on preexisting habits in her students. \"Let's face it, everywhere you look our young people are on their phones or iPads, \" she explains. \"They're listening to music, watching videos, why not use this to our advantage? The app includes 29 categories of words, including phrases, greetings and morning routines. It functions similarly to other popular language apps, like Duolingo and Rosetta Stone, giving users the chance to hear and read the word, while offering them the ability to record themselves speaking Blackfoot and play it back. In addition to its language capabilities, the app also has cultural significance. Users are exposed to traditional Blackfoot songs, lullabies, historical images and videos. For student Dann McMaster, the app gives her a chance to learn at her own pace, and has also provided her with some perspective when she listens to elders speak. \"Once I started using the app, just being able to hear it, speak it, just having that general practice, now I can catch myself listening to fluent speakers and catching little phrases here and there, \" says McMaster. \"It boosts my confidence, it would boost my motivation to continue learning the language. That's what the app does for me. \" The Blackfoot Language App is currently available for iPads and iPhones, and will be accessible to Android users in the near future.

She's an actor, most recently appearing in The Revenant. She's a mother of three. She's a full-time student at Mount Royal University, on the road to becoming a teacher. Marlowe, 30, is Denesuline, originally from utselk'e, N.W.T. Most days, she can be found at MRU's Iniskim Centre, a supportive hub for all indigenous students. She works with tutors, participates in talking circles, shares traditional food, and invites every student \u2014 including non-indigenous students \u2014 into the space. Marlowe says education is critical.\"As a mom, I'm always stressing to my kids to work hard in school and do well. Education is basically the new bu alo, (that) is what they say. \" When she re/f_l ects on her parents' and grandparents' experiences with education, she sees that she has more opportunity. Her grandmother was forced into the residential school system, which has been described by Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission as cultural genocide. Two generations later, Marlowe recalls her high school career counsellor taking one look at her grades, and telling her that she should try to shoot for becoming a teacher's aid, instead of aiming for her dream job of being a teacher. As Marlowe recounts the story, she tears up, explaining how the school system was underfunded, didn't understand her needs, and didn't recognize what it meant to be raised in a community still reeling from the abuses of residential schools. A professor who is personally encouraging Marlowe by helping her with her studies is professor Liam Haggarty. He's a non-indigenous faculty member who Marlowe says is advocating for her and many other indigenous students at MRU. Haggarty is also a key coordinator of indigenization e orts at MRU. \"In di erent ways and for di erent reasons, universities across the country are trying to increase the amount of indigenous content in their programming across the board, \" Haggarty says. Haggarty hopes students from areas such as nursing, criminal justice, social work and journalism will learn in their coursework that since non-indigenous people arrived in North America there has been this process of colonizing indigenous places into a settler or non-indigenous places. \"It's been a really violent process, it's had extremely negative and detrimental consequences for indigenous communities from coast to coast all across North America, \" he says. \"Indigenous people were basically erased from the Canadian education system which has impacted several generations. \" Some examples of how MRU is indigenizing its campus today include an aboriginal ancestry program, open discussions during traditional lunches, indigenous crafting events and an ongoing Treaty 7 /f_i eld school. The students association is also on board, with Cory Cardinal heading up cultural and indigenous programming. Cardinal remembers being a high school student in Calgary. \"If you're told that 'I don't want you at my school' and you're treated like you're (stupid), you're not going to want to be there. \" Cardinal believes administrators' ignorance worsened indigenous students' chances at success. \"You're getting (ignorance) from other students and your instructors, and it's a very Eurocentric institution that causes a lot of young people to feel that they're not a part of it. \" Many youth dropped out, or ran into trouble with the law. \"When I was younger, there was a more likely chance of me going to jail than graduating high school, \" he says. But he did graduate, experiencing success in both education and career. He's witnessing his children succeed as well. \"My (eldest) daughter goes to a high school (in Calgary) that doesn't have a large aboriginal population but there is an aboriginal liaison that works with the school board that comes and visits her, and there are programs out there that she can get involved with; there's other supports around her that help us help her get through school. She's got a better chance of graduating. \" Though the campus is slowly adapting to support the needs of First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit students, Cardinal says the real challenge is getting students into universities in the /f_i rst place. With funding for education capped at the same level since 1985, there is only enough money to subsidize 25,000 post-secondary students nationwide, far less than the number of applications received says Cardinal. He hopes that an increase of funds will lead to more graduates attending and bene/f_i ting Canada as a whole. \"An aboriginal graduate is going to bene/f_i t all of society, they're going to be paying their full taxes, they're going to be creating, developing things, and I think that's important not just for the aboriginal students but for everyone. \" trathgeber@cjournal.ca TARA RATHGEBER Veronica Marlowe is a full-time student, mother of three, and one of thousands of Indigenous students who could bene/f_i t from postsecondary indigenization initiatives.

However, some believe an increase in government funding and social programs could alleviate this problem. According to Statistics Canada, 8.1 per cent of all people in Alberta fall under the de/f_i nition of \"food insecure. \" Food insecurity is de/f_i ned by the /f_i nancial inability to obtain consistent and reliant nutritious food. In Alberta, food insecurity is frequently caused when the quality of food is compromised, meaning people are forced to skip meals or go hungry for an entire day. Statistics Canada reported in a di erent survey that 15.2 per cent of indigenous peoples are food insecure, almost double the number of all Albertans in this category. And that number doesn't include the people living on reserves or settlements, which according to Alberta's regional chief Craig Makinaw, would likely raise that percentage even higher. \"It's made so cheap, \" says Joe Pimlott, executive director of the Aboriginal Friendship Centre of Calgary, referring to lower quality and over processed foods. \"When you don't have a lot of money and you are trying to feed your family or yourself on a very limited budget, what do you go to? You go to the junk. \" A diet that includes a lot of junk food can sometimes lead to many serious health problems. \"We know that people of food insecure households are more likely to have chronic diseases, \" explains Noreen Willows, associate professor of community nutrition at the University of Alberta. While it's unclear whether food insecurity is directly causing chronic diseases, it does make it harder to manage the ones that are diet-related because healthier foods can be too expensive. But food insecurity doesn't just manifest itself physically. It can also have harmful psychological consequences. Willows says, in the United States, studies show that children living in food insecure households are more likely to have suicidal thoughts, depression and poor grades. \"Just being anxious about not being able to feed yourself can cause a person to have stress or anxiety, \" she says. For indigenous populations, this problem stems all the way back to Canada's history of colonization and imperialism. \"We can't be blind to history, \" Willows states. She explains that the cycle of abuse created by residential schools and the fact that reserves have been prohibited from becoming self-determining are some of the root causes for why indigenous peoples are more likely to experience abject poverty. She also notes that larger families, single-parent households, lower levels of education and lower paying jobs are some of the current factors causing high levels of vulnerability amongst indigenous populations. The compilation of all of these factors has created a social stigma that perpetuates the problem, she says. \"There is always going to be racism no matter where you are, but unfortunately, here in Canada, and Alberta specifically, there is a large concern for an employer to hire an Aboriginal person because of a stigma that they are going to steal, or they are drunks, or they are not going to show up, \" says Joe Pimlott. So, what can be done to end such a complex and deep-rooted problem? A multitude of solutions have been debated, but together they boil down into two key elements: an increase in funding towards programs that provide food, education and housing, and eliminating racism against indigenous peoples. According to Makinaw, funding for these programs is not rising with in/f_l ation. \"There hasn't been increases in a lot of areas, and if there is an increase it might just be two per cent a year while everything else is rising, \" he says. \"And so, we are 15 or 20 years behind where we should be, and that has a domino e ect on everything. \" Makinaw believes that an increase in funding would help job creation and assist in fostering education and housing programs. \"Until we get those areas looked at then there won't be as much opportunity for a lot of people to move ahead, \" he says. Pimlott echoes these sentiments. He agrees that more funding is needed and suggests that creating programs to speci/f_i cally address diet-related ailments can be bene/f_i cial. He also emphasizes that racism against indigenous peoples needs to be erased as it puts a \"large weight on their shoulders, \" and is difficult to breakaway from. He says, this feeds into the cycle that keeps many indigenous peoples in poverty and sustains their inability to afford enough good and healthy food. He believes this can be done diligently by teaching Canadian children about their culture and the importance of having respect for everyone. \"We owe it to our kids and to our grandkids to give them the best life possible. But if me and you are next and don't do what we can, then we are wasting our time. We might as well sit and watch TV and eat bonbons, \" Pimlott says. Willows suggests that a province wide school lunch program would help children living in food insecure homes and emphasize the importance of paying people a living wage. Both Health Canada and the federal government were contacted to comment for this story, but a response was not received.

PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY SAVAYA SHINKARUK34 MAY/JUNE 2016 CALGARYJOURNAL.CATREATY Help required for growing number of Aboriginal teen parents It was early in the morning and the room was still dark as Joy Thunder found herself head down, crying into a mattress. She hadn't heard the door open \u2014 or anyone come in for that matter \u2014 but she knew the familiar touch of little hands and little feet as they climbed upon her back. Turning around to face the climber, Thunder's eyes met her daughter's. The little girl held a look of concern. Sensing her mother's pain, she wrapped her arms around her mother's body. Both mother and daughter lay there in an embrace \u2014 the younger comforting the older crying. Thunder says her daughter Zanyiah-Rae keeps her grounded. \"I don't know where I would be today if it wasn't for her being in my life. \" Thunder, 21, is a member of the White/f_i sh Lake First Nation, a small reservation 120-kilometres north of Slave Lake, Alta. She became pregnant at 18. The father, also from the reserve, has never met his eighteen-month-old daughter. Thunder raises her daughter with the help of her parents while she tries to complete high school. She hopes to graduate June 2017. Her story is only one of many among Aboriginal teen mothers in Canada. According to Statistics Canada, 12 per cent of Aboriginal girls aged 15-19 living on reserve are teen mothers. O reserve, that number is eight per cent. For non-Aboriginal teens, it drops to 1.3 per cent. EDUCATION REQUIRED Angela Mashford-Pringle is a specialist in Aboriginal early childhood development at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ont. She says the teen pregnancy rates found in Aboriginal communities are due to both the lack of sexual health education and access to birth control. \"When [Aboriginal teen girls] do become pregnant, they don't know the symptoms of pregnancy as easily as on reserve versus o reserve. \" This can contribute to early childhood development problems, such as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder or abnormal baby birth weights. And Mashford-Pringle says the increasing population is putting added strain on Aboriginal communities that are already underserviced. \"We have a very young population and we don't necessarily have the programs and services to actually help those people. \"Access to childcare is particularly limited on reserve, so often young parents seek help from grandparents and even great-grandparents - who may already have their own concerns or health issues. Despite the stress this can bring to communities, Mashford-Pringle says one should consider the Aboriginal perspective. Instead of seeing babies as burdens, she explains Aboriginal people see them as blessings. Traditional Indigenous teachings describe babies as gifts from the Creator. \"There is something that is coming with that baby to teach us something, that's part of why you have children, \" Mashford-Pringle explains. SUPPORTING TEEN PARENTS Patricia Jones agrees. Jones is the CEO of Calgary's Catholic Family Services, a partner to the Louise Dean Centre, an institution that helps young parents complete high school. \"Getting pregnant is what got them back on track. \"Jones says, in many cases, teen parents - regardless of their background - weren't attending school before becoming a parent. Now, they're pursuing an education. Dr. Mashford-Pringle also sees some of the bene/f_i ts in young pregnancy, claiming that the often-negative connotations stem from Western societies' way of thinking. \"Western society denounces girls who have babies before they're in their 20s because they want them to follow the capitalist route, \" Mashford-Pringle explains. \"They want them to go to school, get higher education. They're supposed to get employment, then get married and have children, or at least be in a committed relationship by the time they're having children. That's the sense you get from western society. \" Mashford-Pringle says Aboriginal people tend to do the latter /f_i rst - but neither path is better than the other. \"It just depends on your life path and the circumstances around you. \" The Louise Dean Centre, located in Northwest Calgary, is open to young parents seeking help. The school o ers childcare and has social workers on site. This past year, 40 young mothers graduated from the program. ON RESERVE RESOURCES Joy Thunder says she would love to see a program like the Louise Dean Centre's in her community. But, for now, Thunder's mother watches Zanyiah-Rae while she attends school. This can make her feel guilty - sometimes missing class - to avoid being an added strain. Her mother, who is growing older, tends to get sick often. Thunder says, even if she is sick and tired, she will still get up and keep my daughter, when she should really be resting. In these smaller Aboriginal communities getting an education is a necessity. The lack of jobs and resources limits community members' opportunities. A higher education can sometimes be the only route to adult independence. Thunder says she doesn't know how she is going to complete her education but if she can't continue, she hopes to at least have her daughter in a good school when she is older.High teen pregnancy rates among Aboriginals causes intergenerational stress when it comes to childcare nauger@cjournal.ca NICOLE AUGER Joy Thunder holds her daughter Zanyiah-Rae at home on White/f_i sh Lake First Nation reserve.

And while sport can o er tremendous opportunities to learn life skills, there is also potential for this socialization to have negative e ects. Dr. William Bridel is a professor of kinesiology at the University of Calgary, who teaches a course called Gender, Sexuality, and Sport. Bridel believes that due to an assumption that boys are \"hard-wired\" to be physically active, many boys learn from a young age that sport is something they should be interested in. \"Sport can be a place where boys and men learn to be, and are even celebrated for being, overly aggressive and violent. Some sporting places also promote misogyny, homophobia, and racism through the language used in the locker room and on the /f_i eld, \" says Bridel. \"Coaches have a huge role in this, at every level of sport and in every type of sport. \" ROLE MODEL RESPONSIBILITY For Cody Ehrmann, coaching is a responsibility he takes very seriously. Ehrmann is a high-school football coach who also spends time outside of school coaching bantam and midget football for the city. Ehrmann believes the key to creating a positive environment for your athletes is to exhibit model behaviour yourself. \"That means not talking poorly about your opposition, not o ering special privileges to certain kids who show the 'most' masculinity or who are the most popular. It's about treating everyone equally, and not being afraid to tell someone if he's out of line, \" says Ehrmann. \"I've seen /f_i rsthand the way that sport can positively change a kid's life, \" he explains, \"so I work very hard to be the kind of coach who inspires that kind productivity on and o the /f_i eld. \" For athletes like Braiden Schmidt, e orts like that can make all the di erence - even once they have moved on from the sport. Schmidt is a 22-year-old student at Mount Royal University who grew up playing football from the time he was ten. Schmidt served as the captain of his high school football team and took home three city championships over his time in the sport. \"My coaches played a very paternal role for me, I saw them more often than my own teachers and family members for those years. I certainly looked up to them and respected them, they were experts at the game and I wanted to learn everything I could from them while I could. \" Schmidt says he experienced both the positives and negatives of socialization in his time on the team. \"Locker room chats about girls, cars, sports, beer, and all things 'masculine' often introduced me to topics I wasn't directly involved in, \" Schmidt explains, \"the male camaraderie and mutual respect for teammates and coaches was very key. On the /f_l ip side, the trash talking and competitive nature changed my perspectives of masculinity into a type of 'battle of the /f_i ttest' . \" However, Schmidt looks back on his time in football as an overwhelmingly positive in/f_l uence. \"I believe that without football, I would be less able to relate to the male /f_i gures in my life. Growing up without a father, I didn't develop a strong understanding of many of the same social cues as my peers, \" explains Schmidt. \"Football taught me about the importance of having respect for fellow men, even in the heat of competition. I learned how to be a humble, win or lose. I was taught discipline and punished for tardiness. Most of all, I learned how to make friends and relate to my gender in ways that are subtle, like a firm handshake, or even intangible, like tone and attitude. \" LIFTING THE LIMITS In a 2010 paper from Psychology of Men & Masculinity, academics from Indiana University conducted a qualitative analysis of college football coaches and athletes to understand the patterns that emerged in perceptions of masculinity. They concluded that \"young athletes do not gain life skills simply by participating in sport; rather, coaches need to structure the sporting environment intentionally in order to facilitate this development. \" For Bridel, this illustrates how coaches have a responsibility to lift some of the limits that traditional masculinity imposes on young men, and mediate the tendency for sport to become a place of misogyny, homophobia, and racism. \"Coaches need to appreciate that traditional forms of masculinity are very limiting, and need to move beyond such models both in their own behaviours and in the way they coach their athletes, \" he says. \"We need to continue to work to challenge the popular notion that it is not acceptable for boys and men to talk about their feelings, to express their emotions, to discuss things like health, pain, and injury. We do a disservice to young men and boys when we don't give them permission to feel. \" \"We do a disservice to young men and boys when we don't give them permission to feel. \" -Dr. William Bridel Professor of kinesiology, University of Calgary Football player Scott McKay relies on his coach for more than learning plays PHOTO BY MEGAN MACKAYmmackay@cjournal.ca MEGAN MACKAYCollege sports in the United States are much more lucrative compared to their Canadian counterparts. In part, this is because college sports in the U.S are heavily supported financially, and winning is the ultimate goal. But men's hockey programs at the CIS (Canadian Interuniversity Sport) level take winning just as seriously. Several teams in the CIS are putting themselves in the best position to win by hiring head coaches with extremely strong resumes. Teams such as Mount Royal University, University of Calgary, University of Regina the University of Lethbridge have all hired coaches from either the WHL (Western Hockey League), NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) or the AHL (American Hockey League). Hiring a coach who has been behind the bench at a high level holds more advantages than his familiarity with the advanced strategy. Knowing how to get the best out of his squad is an important key to success, especially at the CIS level, something that Mount Royal has benefitted from since hiring former NCAA assistant coach, Bert Gilling. The Cougars' coach just completed his second season behind Mount Royal's bench and was recently named Canada West coach of the year for the second straight season. Gilling is meticulous with his preparation. When not at the rink, Gilling can be found in his office scrolling through game film and making notes to better prepare his team for the next challenge, the next game or even the next practice. During practice Gilling yells out set drills and the team gets to work, making the most out of their time on the ice. The head coach, and former defenseman for the University of Minnesota Duluth, skates around watching his team execute drills as well as giving one-on-one mentorship wherever needed. The Cougars have improved year after year since the hire, even appearing in the top ten rankings several times last season as one of the best teams in the country.A NEW ERA, A NEW BELIEF Mount Royal Cougars' captain Matt Brown believes the attitude that Gilling brings to the locker room has been invaluable and is one of the reasons for the team's quick and vast improvements. Brown says one of the biggest differences between the team before Gilling arrived and today is: \"the belief that we can be a national contender. Last year we got ourselves in the rankings a few times and made a pretty good push down the stretch to try and make it to the national tournament. \" Gilling says he was excited about the group before he was even hired, speaking to several players while he was being interviewed for the position. He explains he knew there was potential and the belief that Brown speaks of is justified. \"I looked at these guys and they're prominent WHL players, \" says Gilling. \"They played for prominent coaches and prominent programs and they wanted more and they were hungry for more, they saw potential in this program and they were ready. \" The University of Regina's men's hockey program also made a high profile hire to place behind their bench, hiring Todd Johnson former assistant with the junior league's Kootenay Ice. The university's dean and professor of kinesiology and health studies Harold Riemer, who was involved in hiring the program's head coach, says that high-class coaches are essential to success. 36 MAY/JUNE 2016 CALGARYJOURNAL.CASPORTS CIS hockey stepping up its game with elite coaches No league seems to be o the table for Canadian Interuniversity Sport programs when looking for their next head coaching hire. agrant@cjournal.ca ASHLEY GRANT \"I don't see the demand for quality head coaches going down anytime soon and I do believe that's the trend of that we are in right now. \" - Bert Gilling, Mount Royal Cougars' Head Coach Mount Royal University's men's hockey coach Bert Gilling addresses his team before practice, going over drills for practice session. PHOTO BY ASHLEY GRANT\"My personal view is that if you're going to have athletics you may as well be good at it and that begins with hiring good quality coaches who can recruit good quality athletes, and then put those pieces together and end up winning, and at least performing very well or being competitive so you know I personally believe it is an important piece. \" ASSEMBLING A COMPETITIVE TEAM When asking collegiate coaches, or athletic directors what the key to building a winning program is, recruitment is one aspect that comes up time and time again. Riemer believes recruitment is an area that can see dramatic improvement when hiring a coach with experience with leagues such as the WHL. Players that have played in the WHL, OHL (Ontario Hockey League), QMJHL (Quebec Major Junior Hockey League) or similar leagues are considered professionals and therefore unable to participate in collegiate hockey in the United States. Riemer explains that playing for Canadian universities in the CIS is an outlet that can attract players who are not going to play in professional leagues, such as the NHL. The relationships that coaches have with players in various leagues can help their team land serious talent. \"To be competitive you need to attract high quality WHL players and certainly having some background, either professionally or in the WHL is beneficial in that regard because of the networks that you have from a recruiting perspective, \" says Riemer. It seems though it is extremely difficult to have on-ice success without recruitment success and vice versa. Gilling says his first summer with the Cougars he joined very late in to the recruitment process, but was still able to sign a handful of talented players. Now that Gilling is established he feels a lot more confident that his program has a bright future. \"We've had one full season of recruiting, now that's a four-year process, we're not even done year two yet, \" says Gilling. \"So that's a component of it too, you bring in highly motivated, committed student-athletes who are talented hockey players. The more success you have the more attractive you become to those better players as well. \" But with Mount Royal being a relatively new program to the CIS, building the team into a well-known program is another task the coach is in charge of. Gilling says that his experience with his NCAA team, Bemidji State University, helped him visualize what he had to do to be successful with that facet as well. \"I have a very strong appreciation for the division one model of development and what they are doing and I saw it evolve down in the NCAA ... So I saw that in terms of what we are doing in terms of off the ice with strength-conditioning, the accountability with academic performance, the practice development, the game preparation, the video component. \" Brown, also a former member of the Qu\u00e9bec Remparts and Moncton Wildcats of the QMJHL, like many other players on the Cougars' roster are familiar with playing for a coach that preaches operating in a professional environment. The Cougars' captain believes that despite former experience playing in other highly competitive leagues, players on the team have learned a lot the past few years since Gilling was put in charge. \"I think we learnt a lot from last year, he [Gilling] has been preaching a lot of maturity and this situation is a perfect example, winning Friday night [Cougars 3-1 game one victory over the University of British Columbia] and showing up Saturday to try and get the job done. \" During that game one win, Gilling was seen coaching to the end when the play got even more physical late in to the third period. Gilling stressed the importance of keeping emotions in check. He leaned forward to be at eye level with his players and gave them advice to keep them focused on the ultimate prize. The Cougars' players all echo a similar sentiment of how important that game management is throughout all three periods and is one of the characteristics that makes Gilling a successful head coach.LOOKING AHEAD TO UPCOMING SEASONS As for the future of CIS teams hiring coaches with strong backgrounds, both Gilling and Riemer believe that it is a trend that will only continue. \"I think the trend of trying to find the absolute best person is going to continue, \" says Riemer. \"We just need to if we are going to be in this business and invest money into athletics and you want to be successful, and coaching is an important part of that. \" Gilling says that it can be difficult to tell what the future will hold for the league, but ultimately agrees with Riemer about the types of coaches that will be featured in the CIS. \"I don't see the demand for quality head coaches going down anytime soon and I do believe that's the trend of that we are in right now ... I think the trend of programs hiring high level or coaches with unique backgrounds and strong hockey backgrounds, I don't see that going the other way, I see that continuing, \" Gilling says.

Surridge creates a monthly public update with information about what resources are available to the community. This month, a mother in Cochrane is o ering conversational French language courses. POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESS, POTENTIAL FOR FAILURE As with any movement away from the status quo, unschooling is subject to some skepticism. Many skeptics acknowledge where there is potential for success with unschooling, there is also potential for failure. Jodi Nickel, a professor of education at Mount Royal University describes the unschooling movement as \"too hands o \" and believes it is important to recognize the bene/f_i ts, educationally or not, of formalized schooling. \"My worry is that unschooling may be cutting o some future options, \" says Nickel. \"If you present a child with an option \u2014 math or soccer \u2014 they're likely to choose soccer because it's something they can see and understand as pleasurable. But many kids may really enjoy doing math! They might think they don't like it, but you'll never necessarily know until you expose your child to that kind of learning. \" Nickel also believes public school is a key experience where students learn to respect diversity, and coexist with one another. \"In order to have a civil society, to live and work alongside people who may not think the way we do, we need to develop an understanding and be exposed to di erent patterns of thought - school is a key part of that, \" she explains. In an outspoken op-ed for the New Hampshire Telegraph, American school teacher Katharine Gregg expressed that while she agreed there are inherent /f_l aws in our education system, she didn't believe unschooling was the answer. \"Some of the principles advocated by Holt seem to me to lead to possibly dangerous conclusions, \" Gregg penned. \"I fear children who are allowed to run the show themselves and ignore the guidance of elders run the risk of growing up narcissistic individuals unable to work with other people. \" But unschoolers like Arnall and Surridge try not to let the criticism get to them. \"Any time you'e outside the norm, you get subtle comments, and some not-so-subtle comments, \" Arnall laughs. \"I just say, well, here's a good book to read on it and when you're done - let's have a conversation again. \" As for Elizabeth Surridge, she believes that unschooling is not something to be pitted against formal schooling, but rather an additional option for families to consider when choosing what's best for their child. \"If school is just... o , then you have to /f_i gure out where is the best place for that child to, at the very least, stay supported, \" she says. POSSIBLE BENEFITS The benefits of doing a PLR will vary from person to person but the goal is always to ensure the client leaves a session with resolution, closure, an answer or explanation and just generally feeling better and lighter. Sometimes the answers and understanding are not clear right away but upon reflection a client can start to make connections in their own lives. \"PLR is life changing. Anyone who has done a PLR usually says it was the best thing ever even if the process was hard. After this experience certain fears are gone, you know death is not the end, \" Hills explains. 38 MAY/JUNE 2016 CALGARYJOURNAL.CACONTINUED Continued from p. 19Continued from p. 13SCHOOL'S OUT FOREVER CAN THE NOW BE "}
