University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 6 of 12 3. Vaccin e Declination . Personnel , Trainees, and Student s who receive an approved Excep tion or Medical Exemption may decline the COVID -19 vaccin e by complet ing a Vaccin e Declination Form and submit ting it to the Location Vaccine Authority by the date established by the LVA , as provided under Compliance/Responsibilities below . A sample Vaccin e Declination Form that may be utilized by any L ocation for this purpose is attached. The following procedures apply to vaccine declinations: a. Individuals who are not vaccinated and do not have an approved Exception or Medical Exemption documented on a Dec lination Form will not be cleared to access University F acilities or Programs in person. b. Any Personnel , Trainee s, or Student s who are not vaccinated may be required to participate in or implement additional NPIs as directed by the LVA or designee to mitigate risk to patients, Personnel , Trainees, Student s, and others whenever they access University Facilities or Programs in person . These may include more frequent and regular asymptomatic testing. c. Any Personnel , Trainee s, or Student s with an approved Exception or Medical Exemption may nevertheles decide to become vaccinated. In this case, they are encouraged to discuss their plans with occupational health, their primary care physicians, or local pharmac ies, and may receive the vaccine through any of these and provide documentation of the administration to the LVA or designee. 4. Initial Allocation . During the period of I nitial Allocation , Locations are encouraged but not required to mandate full program Participation (see Section IV. C below); however, L ocations are expected to comply with applicable legal and policy requirements for providing information to individuals voluntarily receiving vac cine such as the information described in Section III. A.1 above. B. Superseding Public Health Directives . In the event a federal, state, or local public health agency with jurisdiction imposes a mandate restricting or eliminating Participation options, the applicable public health mandate will be implemented at the affected Location(s). Inconsistent directives issued by agencies with overlapping jurisdiction should be discussed with a L ocation's Office of Legal Affairs. University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 7 of 12 C. Tracking and Reporting 1. The following information must be recorded and tracked by the L ocation Vaccine Authority or de signee in the applicable confidential health record, consistent with University privacy and security policies including BFB -IS-3 (Electronic Information Security Policy) : date of administration, vaccine type and manufacturer, and site of administration (e.g., University, Pharmacy, PCP, Mass Vaccination Site). Additional information must be recorded when vaccines are administered by the Location (e.g., vaccine lot number, expiration date, name/titl e of the person administering vaccine, address of the facility where the record of administration will reside, and version of VIS provided). 2. Any adverse events associated with COVID -19 vaccine administ ered at a Location and reported to the University must be tracked and logged by the LVA or designee and reported to federal and state public health officials using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) . D. Registry and Program Evaluation 1. Appropriate information about all vaccinations administered by the University shall be submitted to the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) or such other registries as may be required by applicable public health agencies or University policy. While vaccine recipients ordinarily are permitted to opt out from registry reporting in California, the California Department of Public Health has mandated that all participating vaccinators report each dose of COVID -19 vaccine administered. Accordingly, the typical opt -out option does not ap ply. 2. Individual Healthcare Locations shall, and other Locations may, evaluate Initial Allocation and, thereafter, program Participation , on an annual and ongoing basis, including evaluation of equity and disparities in I nitial Allocation and program implementation; as well as reasons identified for non-participation or untimely participation, the number and characteristics of Personnel , Trainees , and Student s not vaccinated, and the reasons given (if any) for declination. E. Program Implementation and Enforcement 1. Program Participation is mandatory . Individuals eligible for an Exception or Medical Exemption may, after receiving appropriate in formation about the vaccine, consent to vaccination or submit a completed Declination Form to the Location Vaccine Authority . Declination may require additional compensating controls including additional Non- Pharmaceutical Interventions for the health and safety of the University community , as determined by the L ocation Vaccine Authority or designee. University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 8 of 12 2. Program implementation with respect to Student s will be handled consistent with the procedural provisions of the Student Immunization Policy . 3. Any Personnel , Trainee s, or Student s subject to this policy who fail to participate in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program as described in section E.1 above by the locally established deadline (i.e., by receiving the vaccine or receiving an Exception or Medical Exemption and submitting a written Declination Form ) may be prohibited from in-person access to University Facilities or Programs , including University housing . IV. COMPLIANCE / RESPONSIBILITIES A. CDC and FDA generally translate VIS into many languages commonly spoken in California and elsewhere in the United States and post these online. The relevant VIS should be provided to a person receiving vaccine in a language that they understand. In the event relevant VIS translations are unavailable, they should be accompanied when distributed with a document with taglines such as those approved by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services to facilitate language access by all affected Personnel , Trainees , and Student s. Interpreters should also be made available in person, by video, or by phone during vaccine clinics. B. Each Location is responsible for: (i) assuring any necessary updates are made to its local Infectious Disease s/Infection Prevention and Control Programs; (ii) establishing deadlines for COVID -19 Vaccination Program Participation on an annual or ongoing bas is, in consultation with epidemiology and infection prevention experts and occupational health representatives as applicable and consistent with any supply limitations ; and ( iii) assuring implementation of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program at all sites . 1. Each Location, in consultation with the Location Vaccine Authority and others , as appropriate, shall develop and publicly post its plans for I nitial Allocation of vaccine and any subsequent periods of shortage, consistent with guidelines and directives published by federal , state , and local authorities, including the ethical principles articulated by the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices: (1) maximize benefits and minimize harms; (2) promote justice; (3) mitigate health inequities; and (4) promote transparency. 2. Implementation includes informing Personnel , Trainees , and Student s of the requirement and deadline for program Participation , dates and University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 9 of 12 Locations for on- site administration, and that vaccines will be provided at no cost to recip ients . 3. Each Location should implement strategies for vaccine access, including efforts to ensure vaccination availability during all work shifts and to address vaccine hesitancy, particularly among groups at most significant risk for contracting COVID -19 and suffering severe illness . 4. Timing for implementation will depend on timing of V accine Approval, recommendations of federal and state public health authorities, and the availability of vaccine from suppliers. As a general matter, the vaccine mandate (subject only to University -approved Exceptions and Medical Exemptions described above), will be effective on the later of: (i) the beginning of the Fall Term; or (ii) when at least one COVID -19 vaccine is fully Licensed by FDA and available to anyone who wants it. Students are strongly encouraged to get their vaccines before coming to campus. C. Chancellors and leaders at non- campus locations are responsible for implementing this policy. Deans, Department Chairs, unit heads , managers , supervisors , student affairs leaders , and others with responsibility for personnel management will support program implementation and enforcement . Consultation with Academic Senate leaders, especially on the campus, is encouraged with respect to implementation procedures for academic appointees . V. PROCEDURES Each Location may establish local procedures to facilitate i mplementation of this policy. VI.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUE STIONS 1. What is the relationship between this policy and the currently posted interim policy? This policy, if approved, will become effective at the beginning of the Fall term and at that time will replace the posted interim policy. 2. Am I required to be vaccinated to attend school? Individuals, including Personnel and Student s, must receive the COVID -19 vaccine in order to access University Facilities and Programs in person, unless they have been granted an Exception or Medical Exemption and submitted a Declination Form to the Location Vaccine Authority . 3. How do I apply for an Exception or a Medical Exemption? Procedures vary at each Location [LINK TO LIST ]. 4. How will I know if my co -workers or fellow Student s are going unvaccinated? The University will not disclose vaccine status of individual Personnel , Trainees, or Student s to coworkers or fellow Student s; however third parties and some Locations may distribute badge attachments, stickers, pins, or other indicators that vaccinated individuals may use to show that they have received the vaccine . 5. I am immunocompromised and have been told that my vaccination may not fully protect me. How can I protect myself when the University is not requiring all Personnel , Trainees, and Student s to be vaccinated? Please contact your local disability services offi ce to discuss your situation and reasonable accommodations. 6. Will University of California Health specify which authorized or licensed vaccine is preferred? The UC Infection Prevention Collaborative supports the principle that all EUA -authorized vaccines are safe and very effective in preventing symptomatic COVID -19 and in decreasing the odds of hospitalization and death. In order to reach herd immunity, the UC Infection Prevention Collaborative recommends that every effort be made to maximize vaccine uptake across the UC systems and more widely. This can be achieved by maximizing access, University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 11 of 12 minimizing barriers, and ensuring that our communities are vaccinated within the shortest timeframe. As stated by the CDC, the best vaccine is the one that you are eligibl e to receive and that you can get today . 7. Will Locations provide paid time off for non-exempt employees for the time needed to get vaccinated? Yes. Non-exempt employees and hourly academic appointees may take up to four hours of paid time to obtain each do se of the SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) vaccine. These employees and academic appointees must provide advance notice to their supervisor. If an employee or academic appointee needs more time for this purpose, the employee or academic appointee may request EPSL (Reason 3(d)) for the additional time. 8. What if I experience flu -like symptoms as a result of the vaccine that mean I cannot work as scheduled, or attend classes ? Employees should contact their supervisor s or local human resources offices for instruction but as a general matter, PTO, sick, or COVID leave may be used to take time off as needed to recover . Students should contact their faculty/instructors regarding minor illnesses or disability services to address any significant issues. 9. If I receive an ap proved Exception or Medical Exemption and decline the vaccine, what \"compensating controls \" will apply to me? Currently all employees , Trainees, and Student s must comply with state and local health orders and with Location- specific policies regarding Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions including personal protective equipment or face coverings, social and physical distancing, frequent hand washing, regular cleaning and disinfection, and routine surveillance testing . Additional safety measures , such as quarantin e upon initial arrival to campus and increased surveillance testing frequency , may be deemed necessary by local public health, environmental health and safety, occupational health, or infection prevention authorities , including the L ocation Vaccine Authority . In that case, a person who has received an approved Exception or Medical Exemption and submitted a Declination Form to the LVA will be informed of any additional requirements. 10. Does this policy apply to contractors? Volunteers? Employees of cont ractors, independent contractors, and volunteers who work side- by-side with University Personnel or Trainees, or who have direct contact with patients or Student s, will be asked to participate in the program. 11. Who will pay for the vaccine? Initial supplies have been paid for by the federal government. Vaccines administered by the University as part of the program (e.g., during vaccine clinics or at employee health or occupational health offices) are administered free of charge. In addition, all of the University's health plans cover CDC- recommended vaccines administered by an employee's primary care physician or at a local pharmacy. University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 12 of 12 12. How will enforcement work for failure to participate in the program? Efforts will be made to encourage Partic ipation by receiving education and either receiving vaccine or declining vaccine after receiving an approved Exception or Medical Exemption. Those who, following these efforts, fail to participate entirely, will be barred from in-person access to University Facilities and Programs, and may experience consequences as a result . 13. How will the University prioritize those eligible to receive vaccine? Distribution will be staged at a state and local level consistent with federal and state guidelines. 14. I am at high risk for severe illness if I contract COVID -19 and even though I have been vaccinated, I know that no vaccine is 100% effective. Do I have to come to work if my co -workers or Student s are not all vaccinated? What accommodations will be made for me? Please contact your local disability services office to discuss your situation and available accommodations. VIII.
