As one of the leading complementary approaches to health care, mind-body medicine offers holistic evidence-based therapies to support physical, emotional, social, and mental health through stress management and thought regulation. Applications of mind-body medicine include tai-chi, yoga, cognitive behavioral therapy, and relaxation techniques such as hypnosis and meditation, which attempt to center the mind into a state of flow and relaxation. Patients have found relief from symptoms of common ailments such as anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and even cancer treatments as a result of mind-body methods such as mindfulness, hypnosis, and stress reduction.

What can you do with a degree in mind-body medicine? We have alumni working in a variety of fields and settings, providing their patients treatment and guiding them to a higher standard of living and mindfulness. They include: - Private practice - Integrative medicine and wellness centers - Cognitive behavioral therapy - Family medicine - Medical centers, hospitals, community health, primary care - Medical spas and yoga retreat centers - Corporate wellness centers - Public health - College and university campuses The human mind is a powerful tool for the wellness of the body, and by applying the principles and evidence that support mind-body medicine, students and graduates can impact their communities in observable and useful ways. For instance, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is commonly used by mind-body medicine graduates to improve a person's quality of life. CBT is a talk therapy structured to help a patient identify and cope with emotional challenges and poor mental health. It can be used to overcome trauma, resolve relationship differences, and treat mental illness when traditional medicine is ineffective or unavailable. Another example of mind-body medicine is holistic health care, which is a broad approach to boost the quality of one's physical, mental, spiritual, and social life. Holistic health care offers practitioners flexibility in helping their patients develop coping skills to improve their lives. What sets Saybrook mind-body medicine programs apart?
