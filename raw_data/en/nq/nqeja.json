[ (See Medical Disclaimer)](https://www.nourishdoc.com/Disclaimer) 5. Additional Terms Related To Interactions With Holistic Therapy Professionals, And Other Wellness Experts In Fields Requiring Licensure And/Or Certification. 5.1 Many holistic therapies such as Functional Medicine, Integrative Medicine, Ayurveda, Acupuncture, Yoga, Meditation, Chiropractic, Naturopathic Medicine, Diet therapy, and others may be currently considered a form of complementary and alternative medicine in the United States. THESE THERAPIES MAY NOT BE RECOGNIZED OR LICENSED BY YOUR STATE AS A MEDICAL DISCIPLINE OR PRACTICE. All Services and treatments provided are complementary or alternative to health care Services provided by health care Wellness Experts currently licensed by your state. Holistic therapies are complementary to and supportive of traditional western medicine as practiced in the United States and do not replace medical diagnosis and treatment. [ (See Medical Disclaimer)](https://www.nourishdoc.com/Disclaimer) 5.2 You have the right to complete and current information concerning the complementary and alternative health care Wellness Expert's assessment and recommended complementary and alternative health care Services that are to be provided prior to commencement of service(s) for each appointment including: the expected duration of the complementary and alternative health care Services to be provided. 5.3 The Wellness Expert(s) may require additional health intake forms and waivers to comply within the state and country's laws of practice. 5.4 Wellness Experts on NourishDoc offer a variety of programs on various platforms including online, social media, digital and retreats, classes, webinars, seminars and groups (programs). Online programs may include webinars, emails and videos. Member/member is responsible for taking time to participate in webinars, read emails and engage in programs to achieve success. 5.5 For Consultation: Before you purchase any session, and again before your consultation with your Wellness Expert, please read and understand the below legal disclaimers: Wellness Experts may live and practice their trade in the USA in your state or outside your state, or any other country outside the USA. Wellness Experts may therefore not be registered with the Medical Boards of any US States. As such, the restrictions below apply. Your Wellness Expert may require you to sign consent forms, health intake forms, and other forms needed for their practice in their country. Your Wellness Expert can not legally 'diagnose' any medical condition or illnesses you may discuss. They will listen intently to you and analyze any issues you are facing, and they will inform you how traditional Holistic therapies and practice would interpret this, but this is clearly not a legal 'diagnosis'. Your Wellness Expert will not prescribe you any 'drugs' or 'medicines'. Supplements may be a part of a traditional wellness response to temporary or ongoing wellness issues, but nothing your Wellness Expert may mention or recommend is to be interpreted as being meant to treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Most conditions in Ayurvedic science and other holistic therapies will be addressed via simple home-level approaches or lifestyle adjustments, however, nutrition still plays a key element. Nature offers us an array of powerful solutions for keeping life-balance, however, although natural, all foods, herbs, and spices are not safe for all people under all conditions. Please ensure your intake forms are filled out with thoroughness and care, and please discuss with your Wellness Expert any proposed supplements' risks and potential interactions with medications or vitamins you may be taking. Always discuss any change in the regiment with your Wellness Expert and your local physician The same care and caution apply to many lifestyle changes as well. Allergies and physical conditions can render even the innocuous and apparently healthy activity dangerous. Throughout your sessions, please keep in mind that this event is with Education in purpose and intent. We want you to understand how traditional health and wellness approaches can apply to your situation. We are enabling you to open up communications with some of the most knowledgeable people in the world about this ancient science, but there can still be rare health complexities that arise. 6.
