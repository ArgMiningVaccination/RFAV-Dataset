Our Mission Hood College prepares students to excel in meeting the personal, professional and global chal - lenges of the future. Hood is committed to the integration of the liberal arts, the professions and technology, to the exploration of values, a sense of community and to the preparation of students for lives of responsibility, leadership and service. Additionally, Hood is a contemporary liberal arts college that serves as a lifelong learning center where students can examine, evaluate and plan their lives. Uniquely designed programs, dedicated staff and a faculty carefully selected for its teaching excellence and concern for the development of the individual are the hallmarks of a Hood education. At the heart of the Hood College mission is a century-long commitment to the preparation of students for purposeful lives and careers. Hood believes that the best foundation for employ - ment and further academic training is an education that is balanced between general liberal arts education and specialized career preparation. Hood College, in summary, offers an education that provides the individual with a sense of identity and purpose, a positive self-image, a concern for others, a responsibility to society and the environment, a respect for freedom of choice and belief, a continuing search for knowledge and understanding and a high regard for academic excellence. A Hood Education Hood maintains a vital community that is enriched and energized as it responds to the intel - lectual, professional and personal goals of individual students of diverse races, ethnicities and ages. The Hood environment, both in and out of the classroom, promotes the understanding that learning is interactive among individuals and disciplines, that the exchange of ideas must involve the exploration of values and that education requires lifelong engagement. The Hood College community at all levels aspires to the highest standards of academic achievement and reaffirms the College's commitment to preparing students for the personal, professional and global challenges of the future. The Hood College Advantage A commitment to academic excellence, distinguished teaching, a wealth of academic resources and personal attention all contribute to the Hood College experience. Involvement, friendship and commitment are valued by the Hood community. With an undergraduate population of more than 1,400, Hood offers an opportunity for every student to participate and to excel. Hood's emphasis is on teaching. Ninety-fve percent of the College's full-time faculty hold an earned doctorate or terminal degrees in their field. Hood supplements this core of professors with carefully selected adjunct instructors, many of whom are eminent scientists and profes - sionals in their fields. Involved in professional and research activities off campus, Hood's faculty have strong con - nections to colleagues in both the academic and the professional worlds. These relationships translate into excellent opportunities for students seeking internship placements, pursuing special academic projects and moving into graduate study or careers. Interaction between Hood's faculty and students begins in classes averaging 17 students. Beyond the classroom, students receive guidance, support and challenge from faculty advisers, collaborate with faculty on research projects and share meals with faculty in Coblentz Dining Hall.6 A HOOD EDUCATIONThe Hood College Academic Honor Code reflects our tradition of a place of Honor and Respect. Students, faculty and staff work together to promote and enforce the Academic Honor Code. Hood College is committed to enrolling a diverse student population. Many of Hood's undergraduates are residential students who live in five on-campus residence halls or three language residences. Hood also enrolls students who commute to campus from their homes in the area. The College welcomes transfer students from four- and two-year colleges. Agree - ments with community colleges in Maryland and other areas match earned credits with Hood's Core Curriculum requirements. Hood enrolls undergraduate international students from 24 countries. The College has been recognized as a leader in lifelong education and in career develop - ment. Hood's Graduate School offers master's degrees in 14 areas. These programs emphasize professional preparation and are designed primarily for students requiring evening classes. On campus and off, Hood's academic resources are outstanding. Located less than an hour from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, the College has affiliations with regional businesses, research laboratories, embassies and international organizations, government agencies and nearby colleges and universities. Tradition The Hood community values its distinctive traditions that foster strong bonds of friendship and create enduring memories for alumnae and alumni. First-year students are greeted on their arrival by upperclass students who help orient them to campus life. Parents, siblings and other family members are invited to share the spirit of Hood by attending Family Weekend and special events, including art festivals, concerts, fairs and athletics. For many Hood families, the annual performance of Handel's \"Messiah\" by the Hood Choir is the highlight of the holiday season. Strawberry Breakfast on graduation day, \"Give Your Heart to Hood\" day, Sophomore Dinner, Junior Ring Ceremony and May Madness are all part of a legacy that connects Hood students to the thousands of alumnae and alumni who have shared these traditions over the past 100 years. The academic community includes dedicated faculty, enthusiastic students and professional staff who share a deep commitment to academic inquiry. Leadership and Service Opportunities At Hood, students have the opportunity to gain recognition for community service as well as for academic accomplishments. Each year, approximately 30 Hood students are selected for in - clusion in Who's Who Among Students in American Universities and Colleges, and 21 Hood sophomores are inducted into the Ionic Society, an honorary organization recognizing those who provide service to the College. Membership in Mortar Board, a national honor society, is accorded to a select group of students who are outstanding academically and are campus and community leaders. The Catherine Filene Shouse Career Center offers assistance to students wishing to pursue internships or careers in nonprofit and service organizations. Community Service and Service Learning The College's motto, Corde et Mente et Manu (With Heart and Mind and Hand), expresses the value placed on service by the Hood community. Opportunities abound for students to engage in service learning that is community-based and enhances the major field of study. Maryland Campus Compact Hood College is a member of the Maryland Compact, an organization of colleges and universities that promote the development of global citizens and A HOOD EDUCATION 7just communities in Maryland and beyond.

The Office of Service Learning , located in the Catherine Filene Shouse Career Center, pro - vides interested students with the opportunity to learn through service to others. Here, student volunteers are matched with local, regional, national and international community service experiences. Hood's Center for Community Research , housed in the Sociology and Social Work Depart- ment on the third floor of Alumnae Hall, gives students the opportunity to work collabora - tively with organizations and agencies in the Frederick community on research projects that meet a community need. Students from a variety of fields\u2014primarily sociology, but also those with majors in disciplines such as law and society, social work, history, political science and environmental studies\u2014have applied their research skills to help solve real-life problems while, at the same time, giving the Frederick community access to some of Hood's resources. Academic Resources Hood is particularly well-regarded for its science laboratories, as well as for the strong, collab - orative relationships between the College and the nearby Frederick Cancer Research and De - velopment Center of the National Institutes of Health, an internationally renowned research facility. Other specialized resources include art studios, the Onica Prall Child Development Laboratory, the Williams Observatory and music study and performance facilities. These, together with other specialized facilities and opportunities, are described in the Undergraduate Programs and Courses of Study section of this catalog, within academic departmental listings. The Beneficial-Hodson Library and Information Technology Center is located in an impos- ing 57,000 square-foot, Georgian-style brick building, which was dedicated in 1992. Situated at the College's main entrance, it was named for Clarence Hodson, founder of the Beneficial Finance Company and the Hodson Trust. In addition to its function as a modern academic library, the building houses the Beneficial-Hodson Computing Center, one of the campus' many computer labs, the Hood College Archives and special collections and a book conserva - tion laboratory. The library boasts a modern telecommunications network infrastructure, including wireless Internet capability. Materials collections, student reading and study areas and staff offices are conveniently arranged and comfortably furnished, creating a welcoming environment for recreational reading or serious study. The library successfully integrates information technology with traditional library services and collections. In addition to the more than 200,000 volumes housed at Hood, any of the 1,000,000 volumes held at Hood's five sister libraries in the Maryland Interlibrary Consortium are available via courier within 24 hours of a request. The library currently subscribes to more than 300 print and microform periodicals, and nearly 42,000 additional full-text periodical titles can be accessed via the World Wide Web through numerous subscription databases. The library's homepage provides links to reference sources around the world. These and other computer-based resources may be consulted at a number of in-house computer workstations, as well as from any web-capable computer in a residence hall room or off campus. Video and audio collections are stored in the audio-visual center, with playback equipment for student use. The Beneficial-Hodson Library's mission is to support the curricular and informational needs of the Hood community by providing appropriate library resources, instruction and assistance. This excellent library facility and its dedicated staff provide the ideal setting to encourage and nurture academic inquiry and scholarship. The Center for the Humanities organizes and funds programs and educational opportunities focusing on the humanities for the Hood community. Students are offered the opportunity to enhance course study with free admission to cultural performances and activities. The Janice E. Cole Writing Prize is awarded annually by the Center to the best essay on a subject in the humanities. Humanities faculty coordinate interdisciplinary studies among the humanities disciplines.8 SPIRIT OF HOODThe Center for Science and Mathematics coordinates courses, speakers and seminars within the scientific and mathematical disciplines. Students are offered the opportunity to collaborate on research projects with science and mathematics faculty, as well as to secure valuable intern - ship positions. The Shirley Conner Hardinge Center for Global Studies enhances the teaching, learning, and research of global issues at Hood College.

The center funds scholarships for students studying abroad; provides funding for students and faculty engaged in international/global research; supports the development of short-term international programs; funds a yearly international visiting scholar, and funds awards recognizing outstanding contributions to global studies. The Tidball Center for the Study of Educational Environments , housed in Alumnae Hall, contains materials accumulated by former trustee Dr. M. Elizabeth Tidball during 25 years of research on collegiate learning environments. These include books, commissioned databases, educational journals and speeches. Since 1992, Dr. Charles S. Tidball has become a colleague in research on the baccalaureate origins of accomplished graduates. In addition, the Small Col - lege Database he has developed is an online resource of the Center. The Tidballs, professors emeriti at The George Washington University Medical Center, are distinguished Research Scholars at Hood College and co-directors of the Center. Academic Computing and the Hood Experience Among Hood College's highest priorities is helping its students prepare for the changing environment of the new century and functioning productively in a knowledge-based society. With these goals in mind, the College has advanced the role of technology from being one of purely administrative support to one of core importance, both academically and administra - tively. Hood College annually invests over $250,000 in new software and software licenses and over $70,000 for hardware. Every student now gets high-speed Internet service, state-of-the-art email functionality, and over 7 GB of storage without a technology fee. The school enjoys an Internet connection capable of handling up to 200 Mb/s in data volume as well as a wireless network supported by access points located across the campus. In addition to continuing upgrades to the College computing infrastructure, 2012 will see the continuation of an experi - ment in iPad mobile device integration. All first- and second-year students and their faculty will use these iPads to evaluate new instructional approaches and the impact this device can have on the learning experience. Hood's information technology is accessible on campus from all classrooms and residence hall rooms and off campus via the Internet. Students can use their own computers in their rooms to access the Internet, send email, print documents, consult course materials that professors have placed on Hood's Blackboard Learning Management System, and take advantage of the scholarly resources available on the Internet as well as through Hood College Beneficial-Hod - son Library databases. Hood has also embraced the concept of technology-enhanced Living Learning Centers and has placed a small computer lab in each residence hall that includes Windows and Mac technology plus a networked printer. The college also supports off-campus students with network technology that enables these constituents to access all of the informa - tion on-campus residents can draw upon. Hood College features 24 computer labs located throughout the campus and comprised of nearly 400 computers with sophisticated software applications, half of which were replaced with new computers in 2011. Nine of the labs are open to all Hood students, while the re - maining computer labs focus on specific academic disciplines. Standard lab hardware includes laser printers. The standard software configuration includes the Windows XP and Windows 7 operating systems, the Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access), plus In - ternet Explorer, Safari, and Firefox web browsers for web-based email. Discipline-specific labs include biology, molecular modeling, general chemistry, mathematics, an organic chemistry instrumentation lab, a geographic information system (GIS) lab, a Unix computer science lab, communication arts lab, sociology lab, and a video editing lab. All of these special labs have SPIRIT OF HOOD 9sophisticated domain-specific software that enhance the learning process and extend students' analytical resources. In 2011 Hood College will begin implementation of a Virtual Computer Lab (VCL) to supplement existing College labs. The Hood VCL will allow all students to access the most used software applications from anywhere, on a 24/7 basis. Hood also continues to refresh instructional technology throughout its classroom buildings, with more than $100,000 invested alone in new equipment during the 2010-2011 year. Most learning spaces have a computer, LCD projector, Blu-ray/DVD player, videotape capability and Internet access. This enables faculty and students to incorporate new pedagogical modali - ties into their lectures and class presentations. Complementing this technology is an Information Technology Department team that main - tains and upgrades campus databases, high-definition (HD) cable entertainment, and phone networks along with Mac and Windows servers, desktops, laptops, iDevices, printers and a range of software applications. This team also assists students, faculty, and staff with repairs to college-owned technology, offers guidance on the use of hardware and software, and provides technical help with a range of topics, including wireless access, printing challenges, and more. THE SPIRIT OF HOOD The spirit of Hood is celebrated by the entire Hood community. Students, faculty and staff share in campus activities and traditions. College Life Hood believes that living as a member of a community provides the best atmosphere for individual growth, so all students are afforded varied opportunities to participate in and lead activities at the College. Because Hood recognizes that students require both challenges and caring guidance to grow, a full range of student services and activities is available. The College is committed to supporting the personal and social development of all students, recognizing that life beyond the classroom walls is a vitally important part of the college experience. Hood: A Place of Honor and Respect As a place of honor and respect, all members of the College assume the obligation to maintain the principles of honesty, responsibility and intellectual integrity in all activities relating to their Hood College experience. It is the responsibility of each student to support these values through maturity of thought, expression and action. Members of the faculty, staff and admin - istration are available to assist students in this process. The Academic Honor Code and Code of Conduct Academic life at Hood is guided by an honor system. The basic aims of the honor system are: to encourage and promote a trustful relationship among all members of the College commu - nity, to offer students the opportunity to exercise responsibilities and shared governance on campus and to make students more aware of their personal principles of honor. The academic Honor Code is shared between the faculty, administration and the students. A judicial system of students, faculty and administrators considers and adjudicates violations of academic integrity. The Honor Pledge reads as follows: \"Recognizing the importance and value of the Hood College honor system, I pledge on my personal honor that I will uphold the honor system for the duration of my enrollment at Hood College. Furthermore, I pledge that I will read and make every effort to understand the concepts of the honor system.\" Social behavior is governed by the Code of Conduct. Violations of the Code of Conduct are adjudicated through the Office of Residence Life, the Dean of Student's Office, Department 10 SPIRIT OF HOODof Campus Safety and/or student review boards as appropriate to the violation. Student staff members are employed by the Office of Residence Life as resident assistants to assist in report - ing violations, although all students retain the rights and responsibilities to report any infractions they witness. Dean of Students Office The Dean of Students Office supports the mission of the College through strategic planning initiatives that enhance the quality of student life. The staff is committed to providing co-curric - ular experiences that promote scholarship, service and respect for diversity in a challenging and inclusive environment. Programs and services are designed to retain students and to encourage student leadership, development and lifelong learning. Working collaboratively with other divisions of the College, the Dean's Office holds primary responsibility for the overall management of programs and services of the Athletic Department, Office of Student Success and Outreach, Department of Campus Safety, Office of the Dean of the Chapel, Commuter Life Office, Office of Residence Life, Office of Multicultural Affairs and International Student Programs, Student Activities and Orientation Office, Wellness Center (Counseling and Health Services) and the Media Board. The Dean of Students also advises the Hood College Student Government Association (SGA). Through the programs and services of these offices, students are offered a plethora of opportunities for personal and professional growth. Residential Life The residence life program provides students with an opportunity to live with students from diverse backgrounds, encouraging them to learn from others' experiences. Living in the residence halls helps students learn communication, negotiation and conflict management skills. There are five traditional-style residence halls on campus (Coblentz, Coblentz Memorial, Meyran, Shriner and Smith) that house between 100 and 145 students each. Smaller language housing options for between five and 12 students each attract students who are interested in a French, German or Spanish living experience. One faculty member from the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures serves as the language house coordinator. A native speaking student lives in the residence full time. Upperclass Honors Program students are also eligible to reside in Hood's Honors House, a small community of nine students. Traditional-aged first-year students and sophomore students are required to live on campus and have roommates unless they are commuting from their parents' home. Juniors and seniors are eligible for singles on a space-available basis. Students who feel they have special (medical, psychological and/or disability-related) needs may apply for a single through the special ac - commodations program. Instructions for requesting such accommodations can be found on the residence life portion of the Hood website. During the summer prior to their arrival, first-year students are assigned a roommate based on a lifestyle questionnaire. First-year students may request a specific roommate if they know some - one else coming to Hood with whom they would like to live. During the spring semester, all current residential students select their rooms and roommates for the upcoming academic year. Hood's residence halls are part of a shared governance system and residents elect representa - tives to House Forum through their individual house councils. Students decide when their quiet hours will be and when visitors may be in the halls (within certain minimum guidelines). In addition, the governing bodies of the halls work to provide educational and social activities for their residents. Resident assistants live on each residence hall floor and are available to students who have personal or academic concerns, are having problems with their roommates or just need advice, guidance or a referral. They plan programs, disseminate information and work to build a posi - tive community on their floor by enforcing College policies. The RAs are supervised by Area Coordinators, professional staff members who live on campus full-time. Responsibilities include SPIRIT OF HOOD 11community building, shaping positive student behavior, programming, student support and supervision of building staff. For further information about the residential experience at Hood, please contact the Residence Life Office at ext. 3577. Commuter Life Commuter students represent a diverse population. When not attending classes, many com - muters spend time in the Whitaker Campus Center. The Commuter Council serves as the voice of the commuter students on campus and provides programming and services to commuter students. Various members of Commuter Council sit on student government committees and boards, giving voice to and representing commuter interests. First-Year Living-Learning Communities The First-Year Living-Learning Communities are designed to provide first-year students with a common living and learning experience within their fields of interest. Students in the program will be housed together by community in the residence halls and will be required to attend monthly activities and events related to the themes, to participate in student-created programs and service projects, and to write papers reflecting on their learning experiences. In addition, students will be required to enroll in at least one of the designated courses within their communities each semester. Parking Vehicle registration and a parking hang tag are required to park on campus. Vehicles registered for the regular academic year do not require an additional tag for the summer session. A parking hang tag does not guarantee the holder a parking space, which is on a space- available basis. Parking in the Whitaker Campus Center lot is restricted to commuter students, faculty and staff. Vehicles parked in violation will be ticketed. Campus Safety may designate certain areas as no parking zones for snow removal purposes. Vehicle registration forms are available in the Office of Campus Safety and at the switchboard. Please refer to the student handbook for details, or contact the Department of Campus Safety at (301) 696-3548. Student Government All undergraduate, matriculated students are members of the Hood College Student Govern - ment Association. The student government at Hood represents the voice of the student body to the faculty and administration and is responsible for overseeing many vital aspects of student life. The HCSGA consists of a student senate, which takes up issues of importance to the stu - dent body and enacts legislation; a judicial branch, which is responsible for the academic honor system; and an executive board, which administers the business of the student government and oversees its committees. The Campus Activities Board schedules, coordinates and implements a plethora of programs and social activities for students. The Finance Committee allocates the student activities fees to support the administration and programs of the organizations under its auspices. House Fo - rum oversees the governance of the residence halls, working with the director of residence life to implement policies and procedures, while Commuter Council, working with the director of commuter life and student activities, oversees the Commuter Student Union and its programs. The Academic Affairs Committee has members serving on or observing at many academic committees of the College, representing student views. The parliamentarian reviews the constitutions of all prospective student organizations, ensuring that the Senate and Executive Board follow appropriate procedures in conducting meetings. The Student Rights Commit - tee serves as another voice for students regarding individual or group concerns. The dean of students serves as adviser to HCSGA.12 SPIRIT OF HOODStudent Organizations Clubs and organizations provide students with opportunities to meet others with similar inter - ests as well as to develop leadership, organizational and management skills.

Students are encouraged to explore various subjects or disciplines during their first year and a half at Hood. During that time they are advised by the Freshman-Sophomore Advising Group, a designated group of faculty who have expressed interest in working with students before they declare a major. Students must declare a major by the end of their sophomore year by completing the appropriate form with the Office of the Registrar. Transfer students who declare their major upon entering Hood are assigned an academic adviser in their major field. Transfer students who have not declared a major are assigned to a faculty adviser in the Freshman-Sophomore Advising Group. Improvement of Basic Skills: Reading, Writing, Mathematics The Center for Academic Achievement and Retention staff evaluates all new students' basic skills. The following courses are offered to students who need to improve their skills: English 099, English 100E (for ESL Students) and English 100; GNST 099 and 101; and Mathemat - ics 098 and 099. Tutoring may be recommended to meet specific needs. The Center for Academic Achievement and Retention offers specialized workshops upon request or as determined by the Center.

In accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Ameri - cans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Hood makes every reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of students with diagnosed disabilities. Students with disabilities who will need accommodations must notify the disability services coordinator as soon as possible. Early notification prevents delay in initiation of services and ensures the student full access to educational activities. Students should present documentation of a disability from a medical professional, and this documentation should state accommoda - tions the student requires to participate fully in the educational programs at Hood College. The disability services coordinator will meet with the student to prepare an individualized plan for services. The student is then prepared to take on the responsibility of advocating for her or himself. Lifelong Learning Committed to lifelong learning, Hood has developed programs to meet the distinctive needs of nontraditional-aged undergraduate students. Nontraditional age students should explore the possibility of gaining credit for experience outside the classroom. Through Hood's Portfolio Advantage Program, students can have work experience and other noncollegiate learning evaluated for possible college credit. The portfolio program includes a screening interview, portfolio development workshops and portfolio assessment. (For ad - ditional information, see Portfolio Evaluation in Undergraduate Academic Policies) Students may earn advanced placement credits through the College Entrance Examination Board's Advanced Placement and Achievement tests. Students may also earn credits by tak - ing College Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests, DANTES exams and departmental challenge examinations.

If there are grounds for an appeal because of new information, please follow the steps outlined below: Appeal Process: 1. Appeals must be made in writing within 14 days of receiving notification of the initial ad - mission decision. Appeals should be sent to the attention of the Director of Admission. 2. Appeals must be accompanied by supporting documentation such as new grades, updated standardized test scores, additional letters of recommendation, or other appropriate docu - mentation. 3.

Deferred Admission Students are admitted for the term for which they originally applied, unless they notify the Admission Office that they are unable to enroll for that term due to unusual or personal circumstances. Admitted students are permitted to defer their enrollment for up to 12 months, provided they do not alter their original admission status by completing additional coursework at another institution in the interim. Students who are deferring their admission must pay the enrollment deposit to hold their space in the class.UNDERGRADUATE TUITION AND FINANCIAL AID 25If an admitted student defers enrollment, and then attends another institution (whether coursework is completed or not), that student will need to be re-evaluated for both admission and for merit scholarships. Equal Access for Students with Disabilities Hood College actively supports the rights of students with disabilities to have equal access to education. In accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Ameri - cans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Hood makes every reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of students with disabilities. In order to receive appropriate advice and accommodations, students who have a disability must notify The Josephine Steiner Center for Academic Achievement and Retention as soon as possible. Early notification prevents delay in initiation of services and ensures the student full access to educational activities. The disability services coordinator and/or the medical staff, in consultation with the student, prepares a plan for services and forwards authorization for specified services (such as note-taking, interpreting, special housing) to the appropriate offices on campus.26 UNDERGRADUATE TUITION AND FINANCIAL AID UNDERGRADUATE TUITION AND FINANCIAL AID Costs Tuition, Fees and Other Charges for the 2012-2013 Academic Year Refer to Tuition and Fees at www.hood.edu/campus-services/accounting for future pricing information.

Withdrawal from the College and Refund Policy Fall and Spring Semesters Students who withdraw from Hood will have their fall and spring semester charges adjusted according to the schedule below: If a student withdraws from the College: Tuition Board Prior to beginning of the semester 100 percent 100 percent Within the 14 calendar days from the first day of the semester 80 percent pro rata weekly (See the current College calendar for the actual dates.) There are no refunds of the room fee after the first day of classes. There are no refunds of tuition after the end of the drop-add period. Refunds of the board fee are continued on a pro rata weekly basis throughout the semester. There are no refunds of any fees (comprehensive, academic records, course audit, student teaching, parking or student health insurance) once the semester has begun. This refund policy applies to students who withdraw from the College and to those who take a leave-of-absence during the semester. Withdrawal refunds are determined by the effective date noted on the Change of Status or Leave of Absence Form filed with the Registrar's Office for undergraduate students and the written withdrawal files with the Graduate Office for graduate students.UNDERGRADUATE TUITION AND FINANCIAL AID 27The Office of Financial Aid is required to recalculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw. Up through 60 percent of the semester, a pro rata schedule is used to determine how much federal aid a student has earned at the time of withdrawal. The portion of unearned aid must be returned to the federal programs. When unearned aid is returned, a student may owe the College additional funds. Summer Terms One-week and two-week terms Tuition Prior to first meeting of class 100 percent Within the first 2 days from the first day of the term 80 percent 3rd day and thereafter no refund Three-week and four-week terms Tuition Prior to first meeting of class 100 percent Within the first 4 days from the first day of the term 80 percent 5th day and thereafter no refund Five-week and six-week terms Tuition Prior to first meeting of class 100 percent Within the first 7 calendar days from the first day of the term 80 percent 8th calendar day and thereafter no refund The Need-based Financial Aid System For students whose personal and family resources are insufficient to meet their total education - al expenses, Hood administers both need-based and non-need-based financial aid and offers personalized assistance in obtaining other educational resources from outside sources. Hood College determines the type and amount of aid students may receive by evaluating the student's financial need and availability of funds. Eligible students receive awards on a first-come, first-served basis. Financial Need To determine a student's financial need, the student must complete the Free Application For Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Need for financial aid is determined by the following calculation: Cost of Attendance (COA) Less Expected Family Contribution (EFC) Equals Financial Need To determine the EFC, the calculation formula used is the Federal Need Analysis set by the U.S. Department of Education. Factors that are taken into consideration include: family size, number of students in college, income and assets of both the student and parents and the age of the oldest parent. Complete the FAFSA fully and carefully to avoid delays in processing. FAFSA forms should be submitted online no later than February 15 to receive full consideration for all types of need-based aid. For Hood College to receive FAFSA results, list Hood's school code, 002076, on the application. Financial Aid Package After financial need is determined, the Office of Financial Aid can begin to put together a financial aid \"package.\" Each student's financial situation is different, so each financial aid package is unique. A financial aid package will include one or more types of financial aid. The most common types of financial aid include: scholarships, grants, loans and work-study.28 UNDERGRADUATE TUITION AND FINANCIAL AID All need-based financial aid awards are made in accordance with three criteria: enrollment in a degree-granting program at Hood College, demonstrated financial need and the student's ability to maintain satisfactory academic progress. For many of the need-based financial aid programs, students must be enrolled for at least 6 credits per semester. In addition, for a stu - dent to be eligible for any federal financial aid, the student must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the United States; have a high school diploma or equivalent; not be in default on a Federal Perkins Loan or Federal Stafford Loan; and be registered with Selective Service (if required). Students who qualify for financial aid are notified in the form of a financial aid award letter. This award letter is sent to admitted students in the spring prior to the academic year for which financial assistance is sought. Continuing students will receive their award letters begin - ning in April prior to the fall semester upon receipt of their renewal application for financial aid and any other required documents. All financial aid forms are located on the web at: www.hood.edu/admission/financial Financial Aid Programs Federal Pell Grants \u2014Awarded to undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need. Prorated awards may be made to eligible part-time students. Students must be pursuing their first baccalaureate degree.

Federal Work Study Program \u2014This federally-funded need-based employment program en- ables eligible undergraduate students to earn money for miscellaneous expenses while gaining practical experience in on- and off-campus jobs. Campus Employment \u2014Awarded to students who are not eligible for federal work-study. Funded and administered by Hood College. Limited number of positions are available. Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan \u2014A need-based student loan program offered to undergraduate and graduate students. The interest rate is fixed. No interest accrues and gener - ally no payments are due while a student is enrolled on at least a half-time basis. Repayment generally begins six months after leaving Hood College. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Direct Stafford Loan \u2014A non-need-based student loan program offered to undergraduate and graduate students. The interest rate is fixed. The six-month deferment applies only to repayment on the principal. Interest accrues when the loan is dis - bursed. Students are mailed quarterly interest statements at which time they may elect to pay the interst. Federal Direct PLUS Loan \u2014Parents may borrow up to the cost of education, minus any financial aid received, for each dependent undergraduate student. The interest rate is fixed. Repayment on principle and interest begins when the loan is disbursed, however deferment options are available. Maryland State Scholarship Program \u2014The Maryland Higher Education Commission offers several need-based scholarships and grants for Maryland residents. The scholarships and grants most frequently awarded to Hood students include, but are not limited to, the Educational Assistance Grant, the Guaranteed Access Grant, Senatorial Scholarship and Delegate Scholar - ship. In order to be considered for a Maryland State Scholarship, a student must file the Free UNDERGRADUATE TUITION AND FINANCIAL AID 29Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by March 1. Some state scholarships may have additional application requirements. Please check with the Maryland Higher Education Commission-Student Financial Assistance at (800) 974-0203 or www.mhec.state.md.us Veterans' Educational Benefits \u2014Hood College serves as a liaison/informational resource to veterans by providing Veterans Administration forms and certifying eligibility status, and is a Yellow Ribbon-participating institution. To initiate or continue benefits, veterans must contact the Registrar's Office, (301) 696-3616. at the beginning of each semester to complete the required paperwork, in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the registrar and the Veterans Administration. Information and application forms may be obtained from the Registrar's Office located on the second floor of the Joseph Henry Apple Academic Resource Center. Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements for Financial Aid (SAP) Students are expected to maintain a record of academic achievement that will enable them to graduate in a reasonable time period. Undergraduate students receiving financial aid at Hood College of any type (federal, state, institutional and/or outside scholarships/grants) must dem - onstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively the ability to do satisfactory academic work and to progress measurably toward a degree. This is in addition to any renewal criteria required for specific state, institutional or other outside awards. Federal regulations require the Financial Aid office to monitor students' (undergraduate and graduate) academic progress at the end of each academic year. This is to ensure that students receiving funds are successfully progressing through their program of study. At the end of the spring semester of each academic year, the Financial Aid Office evaluates the academic progress of each student receiving financial aid according to the standards set forth below by the College. This evaluation determines a student's eligibility to receive financial assistance in the next academic year. In addition, at the end of both the fall and spring semesters, the registrar reviews the qualitative academic progress of all degree-seeking students to determine the eligibility for continued enrollment at Hood College. In order to graduate a student must complete 124 credits and have a minimum GPA of 2.0. To remain eligible for most types of financial aid, particularly federal and state assistance, stu - dents must meet minimum academic requirements at the end of each academic year. Students are considered to be making satisfactory progress toward degree completion for financial aid purposes by adhering to the schedule outlined below. SEMESTER COMPLETED CREDITS EARNED CUMULATIVE G.P.A. Second 25 1.50 Third 38 1.60 Fourth 50 1.70 Fifth 63 1.90 Sixth 75 2.00 Seventh 88 1.60 Eighth 100 1.70 Ninth 113 1.90 Tenth 124 2.00 The maximum time frame in which a student is expected to complete his or her degree is 150 percent of the published length of the program measured in academic credits. Students will become ineligible for any type of financial aid after attempting 186 credits. For an undergradu - ate program, the time frame cannot exceed 150 percent of the published length of the program measured in credit hours attempted. For example, the published length of an undergraduate academic program is 124 credit hours, the maximum period must not exceed 186 (124 \u00d71.5) attempted credit hours.30 UNDERGRADUATE TUITION AND FINANCIAL AID Additional Degree/Dual Degree The maximum time frame in which a student is expected to complete their degree is 150 percent of the published length of the program measured in academic credits for a student pursuing an additional degree or enrolled in a dual degree program. Transfer Credits Transfer credits and/or credits for prior learning given at the time of enrollment will be counted in the total number of credits attempted. During the course of enrollment, a student may transfer credits earned at outside institutions, however, the credits will apply only for meeting the maximum timeframe standard. Treatment of W, INC, AU, F, S and U Grades and Repeated Coursework n Course withdrawals (W) after the drop/add period are not included in the G.P.A. calcula - tion, but are considered a noncompletion of attempted coursework. n Incomplete (INC) grades are not included in the G.P.A. calculation but are considered a noncompletion of attempted coursework until the incomplete grade is replaced with a permanent grade and academic progress can be reevaluated. n An audit (AU) grade is not considered attempted coursework. It is not included in the G.P.A. calculation or completion rate determination. n A satisfactory (S) grade is treated as attempted credits earned, but it is not included in the G.P.A. calculation. n An unsatisfactory (U) grade is treated as attempted credits that are not earned, but it is not included in the G.P.A. calculation. n A failing grade (F) is treated as attempted credits not earned; it will be included in the calculation of the G.P.A. and the minimum completion rate. n All grades earned for a repeated course will be included in the calculation of the G.P.A. and every repeated attempt will be included in the completion rate determination. Financial Aid Suspension Students are placed on financial aid suspension if they do not meet one or both of the SAP standards. Students that are failing to make satisfactory academic progress and who success - fully appeals will be placed on financial aid probation. Students placed in the probation status may continue to receive financial aid for one semester only but are expected to improve their academic standing (CGPA) and/or maximum timeframe progress so that the standards of SAP are met by the end of the following semester. Financial Aid Probation If at the end of the probationary period the student still does not meet the standards set forth in this policy, eligibility to receive financial aid of any type will be suspended. Students who fail to meet the maximum timeframe toward completion of their degree within 186 attempted credits will have their financial aid canceled. Reinstatement of Aid after Probation Appeal is Approved Reinstatement of financial aid after a student is placed on suspension is achieved as follows: n The student submits a written letter of appeal in accordance with the appeals process and the Financial Aid Appeals Committee grants the appeal. The student is placed on financial aid probation for one semester and is allowed to maintain their aid eligibility. SAP will be reviewd at the end of that semester; or n The student attends Hood College during the suspension semester, pays for tuition and fees without the help of student aid and does well enough in the coursework to satisfy all the satisfactory academic progress standards. The student must notify the Office of Financial UNDERGRADUATE TUITION AND FINANCIAL AID 31Aid if they are planning to attend Hood College without the assistance of financial aid; or n The student may attend summer school to eliminate the deficiency in credits or G.P.A. The student must notify the Office of Financial Aid if they are planning to take classes during the summer to eliminate the deficiency. Students cannot take classes at another institution to resolve a G.P.A deficiency. Classes must be taken at Hood College. A student whose eligibility has been suspended may regain eligibility at the end of any term after which they meet the above criteria. Students who have been placed on suspension cannot skip a semester and regain eligibility. No financial aid will be disbursed during subsequent semesters for students on suspension. Appeals Process Appeals of financial aid suspension must be made in writing to the director of financial aid by the date specified in the suspension notification letter. The appeal letter must address the extenuating circumstance(s) why satisfactory academic progress was not made, why the extenuating circumstance(s) has changed, as well as an outlined plan of corrective action for future academic success. The appeal must explain why the student failed to meet satisfactory academic progress and what has changed in the situ - ation that will allow him to make satisfactory progress at the next evaluation. Extenuating circumstances can include, but is not limited to, illness or injury; death of a family member; family difficulties; interpersonal problems with friends, roommate, significant others; difficulty balancing work, athletics, family responsibility; or financial difficulties. The director of financial aid will review the appeal and notify the student in writing within 10 working days whether the appeal has been accepted or denied. If the appeal has been accepted, the letter to the student will detail the academic plan of corrective action as well as require the approval of the student's academic adviser. All decisions made by the director of financial aid are final and will not be subject to further review. Merit Scholarships Hood College has developed an extensive merit scholarship program that recognizes outstand - ing achievement and/or demonstrated talent and accomplishment in leadership, research, com - munity service or writing. Students admitted to Hood are considered for merit scholarships at the time of admission. Some scholarships, however, are awarded through an interview process involving our Faculty Scholarship Committee. Each year, Hood College awards more than $5 million in merit-based scholarships. Merit- based scholarships range from $2,000 to full-tuition. From time to time, an individual student-applicant may qualify for consideration in more than one scholarship category. In such a case, the highest scholarship amount will take precedence in Hood's awarding process. All are limited up to eight semesters. Students are notified of yearly renewal criteria, including minimum grade point average, upon receipt of their financial aid award letter. n Hodson Trust Academic Scholarship \u2014awarded to incoming full-time first-year students who have the highest academic profiles and have shown leadership in school and commu - nity activities.

Encore Program The Encore Program enables Hood alumnae and alumni who hold a B.A. or B.S. from Hood to take undergraduate courses at one-half tuition. Family Tuition Plan The Family Tuition Plan enables two or more members of the same family to pay reduced tuition costs. For these purposes, a family is defined as mother, father and dependent children. Under the Family Tuition Plan, one member of the family enrolls as a full-time undergraduate student and pays full-time undergraduate tuition. Other family members enrolling at the Col - lege will receive a 25 percent reduction in tuition, graduate and undergraduate, whether they are full-time students or part-time students. All students admitted under the Family Tuition Plan must meet the regular admission stan - dards of the College, as appropriate. The Family Tuition Plan applies to tuition only and does not apply to board or other fees. As long as one member of the family is paying full undergrad - uate tuition, the Family Tuition Plan is in effect. The Plan is also applicable to the Summer Session if one member of the family is enrolled for at least 6 credits of undergraduate study. Renewal Not Retirement Hood's Renewal Not Retirement (RNR) program offers persons 60 years of age or older the opportunity to audit undergraduate courses. Studio and lab courses, practicums and self-direct - ed study courses are not available for audit.38 UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTSUNDERGRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Degrees Hood offers two undergraduate degrees: the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science. Candidates for these degrees must complete requirements as outlined below. It is the responsi - bility of the student to be sure that all degree and major requirements are fulfilled by gradua - tion. General Requirements n Demonstration of the ability to write and speak standard English (included in the grade evaluation for every course at Hood College). n Compliance with all general regulations of the College and of the Student Government Association. Graduation Requirements n Completion of at least 124 credits in courses numbered 100 or above. n Achievement of a 2.0 cumulative Grade Point Average. n Enrollment in the final 30 credits on the Hood campus as a degree candidate. n Completion of the College Core Curriculum. n Completion of all major requirements. Major Requirements n A 2.0 cumulative Grade Point Average in courses in the major discipline must be main - tained. n A minimum of 12 credits of course work in the major discipline must be completed at Hood. The Second Degree Students who wish to earn any two degrees (B.A. and B.S.) concurrently must accumulate 154 semester hours of credit and fulfill Core Curriculum requirements for both degrees and the requirements for both majors. Students already holding a bachelor's degree who wish to earn a second bachelor's degree, must accumulate at least 30 credits as a degree candidate at Hood and meet all degree and major requirements. Some departments require more than two semesters of full-time enrollment. A determination of how many credits must be earned at Hood for the second degree is made by the registrar, based on evaluation of the transcript from the original degree-granting institu - tion. A second bachelor's degree is offered through the Encore Program to Hood alumnae and alumni who hold a B.A. or B.S. from Hood. (This program is not available to alumnae and alumni who have only attended Hood's Graduate School.) The same provisions apply as above, but at one-half tuition. Hood graduates apply for reinstatement as degree candidates through the Registrar's Office. The Hood College Core Curriculum The Core Curriculum is required of all students. All students admitted as a first-year student must fulfill the Foundation, Methods of Inquiry and Civilization areas of the core. Transfer students with an A.A., A.A.T. or A.S. degree are exempt from the Foundation and Methods of Inquiry areas of the Core. Students without the associate degrees mentioned, but transfer - ring with at least 56 credits, and transfer students pursuing the B.S. in Computer Science UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS 39should refer to the core requirements information listed at the end of this section. Students pursuing the B.S. in Nursing, admitted with the A.S. are exempt from the Foundations and Methods of Inquiry areas, but must complete the Western and Non-Western Civilization areas of the Core. The purpose of the Core Curriculum is to provide students with the basic skills needed to pursue a liberal arts education, to expose them to a variety of modes of inquiry in different disciplines, and to help them develop a better sense of historical perspective in both Western and non-Western civilizations. Three parts comprise the Core Curriculum: Foundation, Methods of Inquiry and Civilization. Foundation (14-19 credits) The Foundation section of the core presents the fundamental skills necessary to pursue a lib - eral arts education. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to write with clarity in English; solve basic mathematical problems and demonstrate some ability to interpret and present numerical data; realize the relationship between physical activity and wellness, and be able to design at least one physical activity program for improving wellness; function successfully using the four skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) of a foreign language and develop awareness of a foreign culture. Methods of Inquiry (22-23 credits) Different disciplines in the liberal arts have distinct ways of pursuing their inquiries. The five categories in this section require that the student will become acquainted with some of these methods. Each course in this section will provide opportunities for students to acquire the capacities that enhance all study: intellectual curiosity, critical analysis and reasoned judgment; focus on methods of inquiry appropriate to the category, including significant achievements in the field; require the practice of writing; be appropriate for first- and second-year students. The five Methods of Inquiry categories are: Aesthetic Appreciation (6 credits) courses introduce students to the analysis, understanding and enjoyment of artistic expression. They will present significant works, explore the relation - ship between these works and human experience and require critical response from students. Students will include one course in literature and one course in art, music, film or another appropriate field. Literature (3 credits) Upon satisfactory completion of the literature requirement, students will be able to read with perception the literature they have studied; analyze significant aspects of this literature; and intelligently discuss relationships between the literature and human experi - ence. Art, Music, Film or Other Media (3 credits) Upon satisfactory completion of the art, music or film requirement, students will be able to discuss at least one of these media from a critical and aesthetic perspective; analyze the development of different genres or styles of expression in at least one of the media; and explain how these media address human values and experience. Scientific Thought (7-8 credits) courses promote the student's understanding and apprecia - tion of science, the scientific approach to problem solving and the importance of science in our society. Courses will focus on the methods of scientific analysis as well as the actual content of the science. Students will take two semesters of introductory science courses, at least one of which will include a laboratory or similar experience. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to understand the introductory content of at least one of the sciences; explain and use the scientific approach to problem solving; and understand scientific or technological information written for nonprofessional audiences. Historical Analysis (3 credits) courses introduce students to an analysis of human affairs that goes beyond the mere narration of historical facts by acquainting students with the methods historians use to describe, explain and reconstruct the past. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to make use of historical information found in primary source materials; place significant works in their proper historical and cultural context; assess the complex relationship between historical events and the human condition; and chronologi -40 UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTScally order and explain the significance of major events and the development of key social and political institutions for at least one period of history. Social and Behavioral Analysis (3 credits) courses introduce students to the study of human behavior and/or the structures of society by acquainting students with the methods used for solving problems in the social or behavioral sciences. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to identify the essential features of society and culture or the major factors of human behavior, either in general or as they apply to particular social, political or economic issues; describe the structures and functions of some major social institution or analyze the effect of social structures on their own and others' attitudes and behavior; analyze and synthesize information that deals with social or behavioral issues, distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information and lines of reasoning and form appropriate conclusions. Philosophical Inquiry (3 credits) courses teach students to think in a disciplined and reasoned way about questions of reality, meaning and value by approaching such questions either theo - retically or through examples that may be drawn from different disciplines or cultures. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to analyze, in a preliminary way, questions about reality, meaning or value; discuss some of the traditional views on such questions; and develop criteria to arbitrate differences between conflicting normative claims about thought or behavior. Civilization This section specifies that students will have some knowledge of the foundations of Western civilization, of at least one non-Western culture and of the impact of science and technology on the modern world. Courses in this section are numbered at the 300 or 400 level and are usually taken during the junior or senior year. Western Civilization (3 credits) courses may come from any discipline but must take as their primary focus the reading and consideration of one or more major works in Western civiliza - tion. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to demonstrate how at least one major work influences the values, beliefs and institutions of Western civiliza - tion; assess the development of some key Western values, modes of thought or institutions in their historical context; and organize and interpret information found in primary source materials. Non-Western Civilization (3 credits) courses may come from any discipline, but must take as their primary focus the study of at least one non-Western culture. They will discuss the devel - opment of thought and values in that culture and require close scrutiny of one or more of its major works. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to outline the development of some pivotal values, modes of thought or institutions in a non-Western culture; show how at least one major work influences the values, beliefs and institutions of a non-Western civilization; place significant works in their proper historical and cultural context; and understand something of the relationships among different cultures, societies and nations. Society, Science and Technology (3 credits) courses may come from any discipline but must focus on selected technological or scientific developments or issues of significance and their impact on human history and society. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to understand, from a nonprofessional perspective, the scientific concepts, laws and principles underlying some major technological achievements; assess certain signifi - cant scientific or technological achievements and their impact on human society or the natural environment. Following is a listing of the course choices for the Core Curriculum. Note that some cat - egories require more than one course.

Declaration of major is made during the spring of the sophomore year. The name of the major will appear on the student's permanent record. An academic depart -48 UNDERGRADUATE SPECIAL ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIESment may refuse to accept as a major, or may drop as a major, a student whose Grade Point Average in the discipline falls below 2.0. The Double Major As a double major, the student specializes in two of the fields Hood offers. At least one of these fields must be declared during the spring of the sophomore year. Students must identify the second major in the same manner during the spring of the junior year. Students should consult the appropriate department chairperson for assignment to a second adviser in the second major. Double majors must meet the major requirements of both departments. The courses may count for requirements in both majors, but the credits can only count toward one major. Students must confer with both advisers prior to each registration. In programs where there is great overlapping of requirements, a student may not double major (e.g., law and society and political science). The Interdepartmental Major The purpose of the major is to allow students with superior achievement to use the existing courses, curriculums and programs to structure an individualized program of studies with the guidance and assistance of a program advisory committee. Working with the Program Advisory Committee, consisting of faculty members from the represented disciplines, the student submits a petition of interdepartmental major requirements no later than March 15 of the sophomore year to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies for consideration. Transfer students with first-semester junior status must submit peti - tions no later than October 15 or March 15 of the first semester on campus. To graduate as an interdepartmental major with an individually designed program, a student must have at least 15 credits in one of the areas represented in the major and at least 12 credits in another field. The proposed major must total at least 36. 300- and 400-level courses, includ - ing a capstone course, are strongly recommended. Approval is necessary before the student implements the program. The individualized program is a contract and, as such, is binding. Students may count toward the major only those courses which are included in the program outline. (Courses within the disciplines contained in the interdepartmental major, but not included in the program outline, are considered electives.) If a student wishes to revise the approved program, the primary adviser will assist and the Pro - gram Advisory Committee must approve the amended outline by majority vote. Any amend - ments must be submitted to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies for approval. However, no significant changes will be permitted if the student is within 36 semester hours of graduation. Minors The following minors are offered at Hood: African-American Studies African Studies American Studies Archaeology Art History Biology Business Administration Chemistry Classical Studies Coastal Studies Computer Science Criminology and DelinquencyEconomicsEnvironmental Studies French French/German German Gerontology Global Studies History Journalism Literature Management MathematicsUNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 49Students may choose from a variety of programs which the College has designated as minor fields of study. The purposes of the program of minors are as follows: n To provide opportunities for students to pursue in a focused and integrated manner pro - grams of study not currently available as majors; n To use existing resources to provide distinctive and challenging curricular opportunities; n To provide an alternative to double majors for students who wish to pursue more than one program of study; n To integrate further the liberal arts and career preparation through opportunities to combine a liberal arts major with a career-related minor or a career-related major with a liberal arts minor; and n To enable graduates to prepare for careers or further study in more than one area of concen - trated knowledge. The grouping of courses in a minor may be identical to a concentration. However, a concen - tration is elected by students within a major, while a minor is elected by students majoring in another field. The minor consists of a minimum of 15 credits of course work, forming a coher - ent program relating to a specific academic objective. Students are allowed to have two majors and a single minor, or a major and two minor fields. Minors are not required of students. The following are requirements for a minor: n A minimum of 12 credits in the minor must be taken outside the student's major and may not overlap with the major. If there is additional overlap, the credit must count in the major. The course may be used to fulfill a requirement in the minor, but the credit may count only in the major. n If a student elects a second minor, a minimum of 12 credits must be taken outside the first minor. Courses may be used to fulfill requirements in both minors, but the credit may count only in one minor. n Students must have a Grade Point Average of 2.0 and a minimum of 9 credits completed at Hood College for the minor to be listed on the academic record. n A maximum of 21 credits may be counted in the minor. n Courses counted in the minor may also count in the Core. n Declarations of a minor occur during the spring semester of the junior year when students submit the graduation audit, listing their intended minor field, to the Registrar's Office. n Students may develop their own minor, with the approval of the department or departments that are teaching those classes relative to the student's proposed minor and of the Com - mittee on Academic Standards and Policies, provided they meet the minimum number of credits and course levels required of minors.Mathematics Education Medieval StudiesMiddle Eastern UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESSecondary Education Certification Hood offers preparation leading to state of Maryland secondary teaching certification (middle through high school) in eight subjects: biology, chemistry, English, French, history, math - ematics or Spanish and art (preK-12).

Certificates in Music Performance and Piano Pedagogy Hood College offers two professional certificates in music for students who already possess a baccalaureate degree in a field other than music. The certificates may be earned in any of the applied music areas offered at Hood: voice, piano, organ, harpsichord, violin, viola, cello, double bass, trumpet, trombone, French horn, euphonium, tuba, clarinet, saxophone, flute, oboe and guitar, as well as piano pedagogy. For more information, see Music in Majors and Programs of Study. UNDERGRADUATE SPECIAL ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES Accelerated Programs Three-Year Bachelor's Degree Program Students entering Hood College as first-year students may be able to complete bachelor's de - gree requirements in three years by carefully planning and adhering to an intensified program of study. These students must declare a major in the first year and, if possible, supplement class credit with credits earned through the College Entrance Examination Board College-Level Examinations Program, Hood Start, departmental challenge tests and summer and January term classes. Most students will need to enroll for course loads exceeding the usual 15-credit limit. Earn Credits Toward a Graduate Degree Hood designates some of its graduate courses as appropriate for qualified undergraduates by giving such courses a double number. Earn a Bachelor's Degree and a Master's Degree in Five Years Students in Hood's social work program may be admitted to Master's in Social Work pro - grams with advanced standing, enabling them to complete graduate degree requirements at a more rapid pace. Hood Start The Hood Start program allows exceptional high school juniors and seniors to get a head start on the college academic experience, earning college credits while in high school. The program is designed to help students become familiar with academic work at the college level and to interact with college faculty. Depending on their high school schedule, Hood Start students typically take 1-3 classes per semester. A maximum of 18 credits may be earned through the Hood Start program. Hood Start students may not exceed 11 credits in any given semester. Enrollment is on a space available basis. Hood Start students are guaranteed admission into Hood College upon successful completion of Hood Start classes and high school degree requirements. Students interested in the Hood Start program must apply through the Admission Office; for information contact (301) 696-3400, hoodstart@hood.edu or www.hood.eduUNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 51Center for Computer Security and Information Assurance The Center for Computer Security and Information Assurance, housed within the Department of Computer Science, coordinates and promotes inter-disciplinary research, education, and ser - vice projects in computer security and information assurance. Center activities bring together faculty, students, researchers, government and industry computer security experts, and law enforcement practitioners to share information and develop new ways to protect users, informa - tion systems, and information infrastructures. The Center currently offers a graduate Certificate in Information Security. The Center's web site is located at: ccsia.hood.edu. Coastal Studies Semester The Hood Coastal Studies Semester is a travel-based, experiential learning program that pro - vides a solid academic framework for the study of environmental science. It encompasses the technological, scientific, historical and cultural aspects of issues currently challenging our wise use of coastal resources. The program provides both on-campus and off-campus experiences for students from Hood as well as those from other institutions. The Coastal Studies Semester is open to students of at least sophomore status (regardless of major) who have completed a freshman writing class and at least one laboratory science course. Throughout the fall semester, participants will live, work and study at marine field stations and environmental centers. Participants will earn 14 to 16 semester hours of academic credit by taking a block of courses specifically designed for them. For Hood College students, the courses taken during the semester will satisfy several college-wide requirements, including the Scientific Thought and the Society, Science and Technology courses of the core curriculum. Additionally, students can obtain a minor in Coastal Studies by successfully completing the fall semester and participating in one of the Coastal Studies Field Experiences that are offered during January and summer semesters. See Majors and Programs of Study for more information on the Coastal Studies Semester. Departmental Honors Paper The Departmental Honors Paper is a senior-year program designed for students who wish to pursue intensive research or special projects in close coordination with faculty advisers. The course number 499 designates this type of study. Students writing Departmental Honors Papers are designated Christine P. Tischer Scholars. Departments identify potential Christine P. Tischer Scholars from junior majors with a 3.0 overall grade point average and a 3.5 in the major, and invite students from that list to participate in Departmental Honors. Students who accept then choose topics in consultation with a departmental honors adviser. Students, in consultation with their advisers, select an advisory committee of two additional faculty members\u2014one of whom must be outside the student's major department\u2014who will advise the student as needed and serve as readers. Dur - ing the senior year, The Christine P. Tischer Scholars are expected to work closely with their departmental honors advisers and, where needed, their other readers. They are also required to maintain a B average in the major and present a completed paper or project by the date set by the Honors Committee in order to qualify for departmental honors at Commencement. The Christine P. Tischer Scholars receive 6 credits, which may be applied to the major or considered as electives. A grade of B- or below for the departmental honors project results in conversion of the project to 6 credits of independent study. Withdrawal from the Departmen - tal Honors Program requires the permission of the department chair, the departmental honors advisers and the honors director. All Departmental Honors Papers are included in the permanent collections of the Beneficial- Hodson Library.52 UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESFirst-Year Living-Learning Communities The First-Year Living-Learning Communities are designed to provide first-year students with a common living and learning experience within their fields of interest. Students in the program will be housed together by community in the residence halls and will be required to attend monthly activities and events related to the themes, to participate in student-created programs and service projects, and to write papers reflecting on their learning experiences. In addition, students will be required to enroll in at least one of the designated courses within their communities each semester. First-Year Seminar Program Because an ability to communicate well on a college level is crucial to success at Hood, this pilot program offers first-year students an opportunity to sharpen reading, writing, and presen - tation skills in a small classroom setting. All first-year seminars are reading and writing intensive and will help students refine their skills in critical thinking, information literacy, class discussion, and group work. Each seminar is limited to 15 students in order to allow class members to work closely with their professor and fellow students. The seminar topics are designed to have broad appeal while reflecting the varied interests and expertise of the faculty who teach them. The first-year seminar can replace one category of second tier Methods of Inquiry (except for lab science) in the core requirements. No first-year seminar will count toward a major. Military Science/ROTC Hood College offers the U.S. Army Reserve Officers' Training Program (ROTC) in associa - tion with the Military Science Department of McDaniel College. Students completing the four-year program will upon graduation receive commissions as second lieutenants in the U.S. Army, and will then serve on active duty or in the Army Reserve or National Guard. The ROTC program offers students two, three and four year full-tuition scholarships, and quali - fied cadets may receive monthly stipends and allocations for the purchase of books. Study Abroad Programs Hood students may study abroad in approved programs in virtually every part of the world. The College requires language majors to study abroad unless they reside for two years in one of the language houses. Language students ordinarily enroll in programs abroad that offer instruction in the local language. Hood has formal associations with several established overseas programs, includ - ing those offered by The American University in Cairo (Egypt), Sweet Briar College (Paris), Dickinson College (Toulouse), University of Seville, University of Alicante, Seoul Women's University and the Sookmyung Women's University, among others. Students may also study abroad in short-term summer programs: Social Work Field Experi - ence in Ireland (co-sponsored by Hood College and Frostburg State University) and the Bahrom International Program in Seoul, Korea. Language students planning to study abroad should consult with the faculty of the Foreign Languages and Literatures Department; other students should consult with the Hood College Study Abroad Coordinator. All students intending overseas study should make application at least one semester in advance of the proposed study. The College encourages students to study abroad during the junior year. Some sophomores study abroad because of compelling program or personal reasons, and in rare instances the College permits seniors to study abroad in the fall semester.UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 53The Hood College Honors Program A limited number of academically exceptional students are accepted into the Hood College Honors Program. Combining classroom instruction and co-curricular activities, the Honors Program offers a challenging academic experience and encourages both independent and col - laborative learning. The program requirements are discussed in Majors and Courses of Study. Independent Study and X-Credit Independent study includes directed readings; conferences with a supervising instructor; and papers, reports and/or exams. Two kinds of independent study are available at Hood: regular (designated by the course number 375) and X-credit. Regular independent study consists of a project designed by a student and approved by a faculty adviser with whom the student will work closely during the semester. The number of credits may vary from 1 to 3 according to departmental policies and the design of the indepen - dent study. The subject chosen may not duplicate any course offered during the period of the student's enrollment at Hood. Registration procedures and deadlines for regular independent study are the same as for all departmental courses. X-credit independent study also is designed by the student and approved by a faculty adviser. However, the subject matter must be related to a class in which the student is enrolled. X- credit independent study is, therefore, added to the student's schedule after the beginning of the semester (but no later than the sixth week) and is limited to one credit. The grade for the X-credit is independent of the grade for the course to which it is related. Before registering for regular or X-credit independent study, students should refer to the state - ment on credit limits for self-directed study in Undergraduate Academic Policies Internship Program Hood encourages qualified students (mainly juniors and seniors) in every academic discipline to take an internship, earning academic credits by working in their field, under the supervi - sion of a professional. Internships of 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 credits are available (depending on the discipline). The number of credit hours allowed for a summer internship is limited to 12 and is limited to 3 credits in January term. Students are encouraged to visit the Catherine Filene Shouse Career Center to explore internship opportunities. See Undergraduate Academic Policies, Alternate Forms of Enrollment for more information on internships. Off-Campus Programs and Courses Engineering: Dual Degree Program Hood College and The George Washington University jointly offer a five-year program through which students earn a bachelor of arts degree with a major in mathematics from Hood and a bachelor of science in engineering degree from The George Washington University. For additional information, contact Hood's Department of Mathematics. PLEN Hood College is an associate member of The Public Leadership Education Network. PLEN offers exciting programs that allow Hood students to gain firsthand experience shaping public policy in communities, the nation and the world. Students who enroll in PLEN's Women and Public Policy Internship Program learn about policy, research or social advocacy by working alongside women leaders in the Congress, courts, executive agencies and nongovernmental advocacy groups. Students may earn from 3 to 15 Hood College credits for participation in PLEN's internship programs. Those who wish to complete a PLEN internship must also meet Hood's requirements for internship eligibility. PLEN also offers three-day to three-week seminars on topics such as Women and Congress; Women in Science and Technology; Women and International Policy; and Women, Law and Public Policy. For more information about any of PLEN's programs, contact the Career Center.54 UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESWashington Semester Program Hood College cooperates with American University's Washington Semester Program, an ar - rangement that provides priority access to Hood students who join 300 to 400 other students from across the country. Students may enroll in any of the units of the program: American National Politics Semester, Foreign Policy Semester, Justice Semester, Public Law Semester, Economic Policy Semester, Peace and Conflict Resolution Semester, Journalism Semester, Museum Studies and the Arts Semester, International Business and Trade Semester and Inter - national Environment and Development Semester. The director and academic advisers of each unit help students plan their programs, including a seminar, an independent research project and either an internship or a course at American University. Entrance requirements include a Grade Point Average of 2.5, second-semester sophomore status, a recommendation from the Hood faculty adviser to the program and selection by the director at American University. Credits (but not quality points) are transferable to Hood. Because financial arrangements for room, board and tuition differ from those at Hood, students are urged to consult with the Hood financial aid officer well in advance. Hood students need not file a petition with the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies to participate in the Washington Semester. Community College Exchange Full-time Hood students may take one course each semester at Carroll Community College (CCC) or Hagerstown Community College (HCC) without charge, provided that the course chosen is not offered at Hood during the academic year. See Academic Policies for more infor-mation on this program. UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES Appeals to academic policy may be made to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. Petition forms are available in the Office of the Registrar. Academic Honor Code All Hood undergraduates affirm on each class assignment that they \"have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid.\" Cheating or plagiarism\u2014any unacknowledged use of another person's language or ideas\u2014is thus both an affront to the general standards of conduct on which an intellectual community depends and a specific violation of the Honor Code. As such, these offenses are treated seriously and may lead to severe disciplinary action, including dismissal from the College. For a full description of the policies and procedures of the Honor Code, contact the dean of students. Students wishing advice on the proper use and acknowledgement of scholarly materials should consult their individual instructors, the library staff and any of the several reliable guides to scholarly writing that these sources may recommend. Copyright Statement: Hood College affirms the obligation of its faculty, staff, and students to comply with all Federal copyright laws (Title 17, United States Code). Copyright law gives copyright holders (writers, publishers, artists, etc.) exclusive rights to distribute, copy, perform, or publicly display, their own original works. The College recognizes its obligation to promote the rights and responsibilities granted under this law. Hood College assumes that any ques - tions regarding copyright, as they apply to materials for instructional or other College use, will be resolved prior to the use of those materials on College-owned equipment or in College-sanctioned activities. As members of an institution with an established Honor System emphasizing intellectual integrity, the Hood College community should recognize their responsibility to follow the law and to model it for others. All members of the College community are responsible for comply - ing with College guidelines regarding the legal use of copyrighted materials, regardless of their format or the purpose for which they are used, and for complying with the requirements of copyright law, including obtaining required permissions to use copyrighted materials. Mem -UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 55bers of the Hood community who willfully disregard copyright law do so at their own risk and assume any liability, which may include criminal, and/or civil penalties. In addition, disciplin - ary action may be taken as outlined a) for students, in the Bylaws of the Student Government Association (Judicial System), b) for faculty, in the Faculty Code (Termination or Sanctions for Cause), and c) for staff, in the Staff Handbook (Section 405.3). Peer-to-Peer File Sharing: Uploading or downloading works protected by copyright without the permission of the copyright owner is an infringement of the copyright owner's exclusive rights of reproduction and/or distribution. Anyone found to have infringed a copyrighted work may be liable for statutory damages up to $30,000 for each work infringed and, if willful infringement is proven, liability may be increased up to $150,000 for each work infringed. An infringer of a work may also be liable for the attorney's fees incurred by the copyright owner to enforce his or her rights. The files distributed over peer-to-peer networks are primar - ily copyrighted works, and there is a risk of liability for downloading material from these networks. There are currently many \"authorized\" services on the Internet that allow consumers to purchase copyrighted works online, whether they be music, e-books, or motion pictures. By purchasing works through authorized services, consumers can avoid the risks of infringement liability. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act: The DMCA is a response to concerns regarding the pirating and distribution of digital materials, and it helps to clarify how copyright relates to those materials. The DMCA criminalizes the development of technologies intended to circumvent devices (such as passwords or encryption) that limit access to copyrighted material, and it also criminalizes the act of circumvention itself. Institutions of higher education that act as Internet Service Providers (such as Hood College) are granted limited liability for copyright infringement involving the use of their networks if they take steps to designate a local agent to receive notices regarding instances of infringement over the local network and for effecting a \"take-down\" of the infringing material. The Library Director will provide contact information for Hood's Take-Down Officer. Academic Honors Commencement Honors Students qualify for Commencement Honors if they have achieved the following composite average at the time of graduation (see The Hood College Grade Point Average and The Composite Average located under Grades): Summa Convocation Honors Convocation Honors are awarded to current sophomores, juniors or seniors who achieved a 3.6 or above G.P.A. for the preceding year. The College bases this G.P.A. on at least 12 semester hours of Hood work (or approved study away) on letter-grade basis. Students who have re - ceived incomplete grades for the year are not eligible. Dean's List The Dean's List recognizes degree-seeking students who completed at least 6 semester hours of Hood work (or who have received permission to study abroad or away for a semester) and achieved a 3.5 or above semester G.P.A. Students who have received incomplete grades for the semester are not eligible. 56 UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESHood College Scholar A Hood College Scholar, named at the beginning of the junior or senior year, is the student who received Convocation Honors for at least two consecutive years (may include approved study away). A student who has graduated from the College is not eligible to become a Hood College Scholar. Academic Standing and Classification n Classification n Academic Standing n Academic Warning n Academic Probation n Academic Dismissal n Dismissal and Reinstatement n Financial Aid Implications Classification Classification standards are as follows: Freshman: fewer than 25 credits earned. Sophomore: 25-55 credits earned. Junior: 56-86 credits earned. Senior: 87 or more credits earned. Academic Standing Students are in good academic standing when both the semester and cumulative Grade Point Averages are at least 2.0. Hood makes every effort to assist students to maintain this academic standard. It is the student's responsibility to take advantage of the College's academic, health and psychological counseling services as a means of overcoming problems impeding progress. At the end of each semester, the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies considers the records of those students who have earned a semester or cumulative average below 2.00, and examines the records of students previously placed on academic warning or probation. Academic action by the Committee is based not only on the academic record, but includes input from the offices of Residence Life, Disability Services, Student Affairs and the stu - dent's instructors and adviser, regarding issues such as attendance and completion of assigned coursework, and issues from outside the classroom that may have affected a student's academic success. Based on all the information, students will be placed on academic warning, academic probation, required leave of absence or be dismissed from the College. In addition, students whose record indicates potential for academic difficulty (e.g., two or more Incomplete grades) might be required to carry a reduced credit load for the following semester. Academic Warning A student will be placed on academic warning if his or her semester Grade Point Average (G.P.A.) falls below 2.0. Academic Probation A student will be placed on academic probation if his or her cumulative Grade Point Aver - age (G.P.A.) falls below 2.0. Academic probation means that a student is in danger of being dismissed from the College for academic reasons. Students on academic probation must make satisfactory progress the following semester or risk being dismissed. UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 57Students on academic probation may not register for more than 12 credits or 4 courses without permission from the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. Students who are placed on Academic Probation will be required to sign a copy of the proba - tion letter, indicating they have agreed to assume responsibility for their academic status by attending classes regularly, completing assignments on time, using course, mathematics and composition tutoring services and/or doing whatever is appropriate to resolve their specific academic problems. Academic Dismissal The College, upon recommendation of the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies, may at any time dismiss a student who is experiencing academic difficulty. This policy applies to all students. Although all cases are decided individually, the Committee on Academic Stan - dards and Policies will use the following guidelines when reviewing academic records: 1. Students whose cumulative Grade Point Averages (G.P.A.) fall below the following levels will be dismissed: Total Semester Hours Attempted* Minimum Cumulative Hood G.P.A. Less than 30 credits 1.75 30 or more credits 2.00 *Credits attempted include all transfer credits accepted by Hood. However, grade point aver - ages listed in this table are based on Hood work only. 2. Students with three consecutive semester averages below 2.0 will be dismissed. 3. The College reserves the right to dismiss at any time any students who fail to meet minimal standards of academic responsibility or who are deemed to be a detriment to themselves or to others, as determined by the vice presidents of academic affairs or student life. Such grounds for dismissal could include but are not limited to ceasing to attend classes, disrupt - ing the life and work of the College community or completing any semester with a term grade point average below 1.0. This policy applies to all students, including first-semester first-year students. 4. Students who are dismissed from the College may not enroll in classes as a nondegree- seeking student. Exceptions: 1. Students with more than two consecutive semesters on probation may be permitted to remain at the College only if the student has earned a G.P.A. above 2.0 in the most recent regular (fall or spring) semester and in the opinion of the Academic Standards and Policies Committee is making satisfactory progress toward the completion of degree requirements. 2. The Committee on Academic Standards and Policies Committee may make exceptions to the above-mentioned guidelines based on input about unique circumstances from the Offices of Residence Life, The Josephine Steiner Center for Academic Achievement and Retention, Disability Services, Student Affairs and/or the student's instructors and adviser. Appeal for exemption from dismissal may be granted by the provost and dean of the faculty in unusual circumstances and following consultation with the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies, the student's instructors and adviser and other relevant offices. Appeals for rein - statement must be received two weeks prior to the first day of classes. Students whose appeals are granted will be readmitted to the College for one semester on a provisional basis. Failure to comply with the conditions specified in the letter allowing them to return to the College will result in their dismissal at the end of the provisional semester, if their minimum G.P.A. for retention is not attained. Dismissal and Reinstatement Students who are dismissed for academic reasons may petition for reinstatement after complet - ing a minimum of one full-time semester at another accredited institution and receiving no grade below a C.58 UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESThe following is the procedure for possible reinstatement: n The student writes to the registrar to request permission to return to Hood. n The student provides transcripts of work attempted elsewhere or other pertinent informa - tion. n The Committee on Academic Standards and Policies reviews the request and makes a deci - sion regarding reinstatement. A student who is reinstated will be placed on academic probation. Reinstatement does not automatically reinstate financial aid. The student must notify the Office of Financial Aid. If a student is dismissed for nonacademic reasons, the student must request in writing to the dean of students permission to return to Hood. The dean of students decides if the student may be reinstated. Financial Aid Implications Financial aid recipients are required to be in good academic standing and maintain satisfactory academic progress toward degree requirements. Please refer to the financial aid section of the catalog for financial implications. Alternate Forms of Enrollment n Internship Program n Self-Directed Study n Teaching Assistantships Internship Program Requirements for 3- to 9-credit Internship n Enrollment at Hood as a degree candidate (nondegree or non-matriculated students are ineligible for internships). n A minimum 2.0 cumulative G.P.A. and 2.5 G.P.A. in the internship discipline. n Completion of a minimum of 45 college-level credits prior to the beginning of the internship. n Completion of at least 9 credits or three courses at the 200 level or above at Hood in the internship discipline. (See additional department requirements.) Requirements for 12- to 15-credit Internship n Enrollment at Hood as a degree candidate (nondegree or non-matriculated students are ineligible for internships). n A minimum 2.0 cumulative G.P.A. and 2.5 G.P.A. in the internship discipline. n Completion of 75 college-level credits prior to the beginning of the internship. n Students may enroll for 15 credits during the spring or fall only. Students may enroll for a maximum of 12 credits of internship during the summer and 3 credits in the January term. The number of credits available also varies by department. Note: Students may take a maximum of 15 internship credits throughout their academic career. Applying for an Internship Students considering an internship should visit the Career Center to explore internship op - tions and pick up appropriate paperwork, including a Learning Agreement to be signed by the faculty internship adviser and the on-site supervisor. Responsibilities All parties have specific responsibilities for ensuring the integrity and success of the internship UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 59experience. Please refer to the Internship Handbook available on the Career Center website (www.hood.edu/careercenter) for additional details. Supplemental Expenses and Time In fulfilling the expectations of the internship, the intern may incur expenses in addition to the usual tuition and fees. Students who enroll in an internship must plan to provide their own transportation or use public transportation. Due to the time requirements of an internship, students may need to work during breaks and holidays. Campus housing is available when the College is not in session. Placement is not Guaranteed Interns are not placed in sites and it is the student's responsibility to find a site. The Career Center and departmental offices provide many resources to the student to assist in locating a suitable internship Termination of Internship Under unusual circumstances, any party involved in the internship may terminate the agreement. Because the internship is essentially a professional commitment, Hood strongly encourages students to fulfill their obligations to complete the full term of service at the site. Unfortunately, on rare occasions, the intern or the faculty internship adviser may determine that the internship site is not an appropriate learning experience, or the internship site may determine that the intern is not a good fit for their internship. In either case, any of the parties may decide to terminate the internship. If this occurs, notify the Career Center immediately. Please note: If an internship is terminated for any reason, the student is responsible for following all procedures regarding adding/dropping credits and is responsible for all tuition, fees and penalties as - sociated with credit coursework. Please refer to the Internship Handbook available on the Career Center website (www.hood.edu/careercenter) for additional details. Time Requirements A student must work a minimum of 40 hours at the internship site for each credit earned. Self-directed Study Hood defines self-directed study as: 1) regular and X-credit independent study; and 2) intern - ships, field work and other courses similar to internships in that they do not have a classroom component. n Students may take a maximum of 27 credits (excluding an honors paper) in self-directed study in the total 124-credit program. A combination of internships and independent study must not exceed 15 credits of internship or 12 credits of independent study. n Students may take a maximum of 18 credits (excluding an honors paper) in self-directed study in the major program. A combination of internships and independent study must not exceed 15 credits of internship, 12 credits of independent study or more than 1/4 of the major program (whichever is less). n Students may not add independent study credits to internships to fill a complete semester program. An exception to this rule is independent study that students take at the Washing - ton Center for Learning Alternatives or through a similarly structured program. n Independent study topics may not duplicate any course offered during the period of the student's enrollment at Hood. n Independent studies are granted to nondegree students under only exceptional circum - stances. Teaching Assistantships Many departments offer students the opportunity to serve as teaching assistants, for which academic credit is awarded. Serving as a teaching assistant affords a student the opportunity to understand the materials of a course or of a laboratory from the perspective of the teacher. The course number 335 designates this type of study.60 UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESLimits/Restrictions: n A total of 4 credits of Teaching Assistantship may be counted toward the degree. The course may be taken for 1-3 credits and may be repeated at the discretion of the department. Departments have the right to limit the number of credits granted per semester and may or may not allow students to repeat the course. n As a general guideline, a student should work at least three hours per week for each credit granted in the assistantship. Attendance and Absence The College does not set a maximum number of absences permissible in any course. Individual faculty members have the prerogative to establish a maximum number of absences at the be - ginning of the semester, and are encouraged to include a written statement of their attendance policy on the course syllabus. Instructors may refuse students permission to make up work missed through absence not caused by illness or emergency. Students accept full responsibility for seeing that work does not suffer from excessive absence. The College recognizes that there are other justifiable reasons for class absence: observance of religious holidays or participation as a representative of the College in athletic contests or cultural performances. Such absences are acceptable only if previous absences are not excessive and if the student has made arrangements with the instructor, prior to the day of the absence, for the work missed. Limits/Restrictions: n Students must attend the first class meeting of each of their courses or notify the instruc - tor or the Registrar's Office of their absence, or risk being withdrawn from the class with a grade of WX. n Enrollment in a course constitutes an informal contract with the instructor, and a student who violates an instructor's attendance policy risks dismissal from the course. Instructors may have a student withdrawn from a class and a grade of WX recorded up until the dead - line for course withdrawal. After the course withdrawal deadline has passed, the student receives a grade of F. n A student who is dismissed from a course for excessive absences or who is withdrawn from the class for failing to appear at the first class meeting may be reinstated only by the joint consent of the course instructor and the registrar. n Classes are held up to the date and hour preceding vacations and they resume promptly after the recess in accordance with the academic calendar. Students are expected to attend classes meeting just prior to and immediately following holiday periods. n Students are fully responsible for making up work missed due to class absence. When students are absent, they are responsible for obtaining lecture notes from reliable sources. Assignments and projects are to be delivered to the instructor on the assigned date, even when the student does not attend class. All exams are to be taken at the scheduled time. Having another exam scheduled on the same day is not considered sufficient justification for rescheduling the exam. The College requires instructors to inform the director of The Josephine Steiner Center for Academic Achievement and Retention of students who demonstrate erratic attendance pat - terns. This is not done to penalize the student but rather to ensure that College officials can assist students in making consistent progress toward the degree. Credit for Prior Learning n Advanced Placement n CLEP n DANTES UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 61n Departmental Examinations n Foreign Language Placement Examinations n International Baccalaureate n Portfolio Advantage Program n Military Experience Hood awards credit for prior learning through Advanced Placement exams, CLEP and DANTES exams, departmental challenge exams, portfolio work, International Baccalaureate, military training and noncollegiate programs approved by the American Council on Educa - tion. These alternative modes of learning are evaluated separately from transcripts of tradi - tional transfer credit from other accredited schools. Limits/Restrictions: n Credit for prior learning is awarded only to students admitted as degree candidates. n A maximum of 30 hours of credit may be earned through any combination of prior learning credits and Hood courses elected on the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis. n Students may not receive credit by examination for any course that they have previously audited, failed, received credit or from which they have withdrawn. n Credit through examination or portfolio may not be attempted during the final 15 hours of credit. n Credit through examination or portfolio may not count in the minimum of 30 Hood credits required for the degree. n The requirement of 12 credits of coursework at Hood in the major cannot be fulfilled by portfolio credit or through credit by examination. Advanced Placement Unless otherwise noted, Hood College awards credit upon receipt of the official AP Grade Report for AP scores of 4 or 5 for the following tests: Art: Art History, 3 credits for ART 220 and exemption for ART 221 Studio Art, 3 credits for ARTS 101 or 123 (score of 3 is acceptable).

No credit is earned. International BaccalaureateCredit is awarded only upon receipt of the official IB transcript. Students who have received an IB diploma, with a score of 30 or higher and with no score less than 4 in any one of the six examination groups, may be awarded up to 30 credits toward an undergraduate degree at Hood College. Students who have not completed the full IB diploma will receive 6-8 credits for Higher Level examination results of 5, 6 or 7. Portfolio Advantage Program Hood College awards credit for alternative modes of learning. Students who have acquired college-level learning through life experiences and other noncollegiate activities may want to explore Hood's Portfolio Advantage Program. This program enables a degree-seeking student to earn credit for prior learning through work and/or volunteer experience equivalent to college-level courses. Students should do so only if the learning cannot be assessed through standardized or departmental measures. At Hood, the portfolio is an organized presentation of a student's past experiences that identi - fies and documents specific skills that the student has learned, mastered and applied to be suc - cessful. Once the written portfolio is completed, the document is reviewed and evaluated by a member of the faculty who will determine if what the student has written is equivalent to what is taught in class. It is the portfolio that enables a professor to evaluate work and volunteer experience and to grant credit for relevant learning beyond the classroom. To participate in Hood's Portfolio Advantage Program: n Once admitted as a degree-seeking student, students must register for at least 3 credits before they can begin the Portfolio program. Three credits of coursework must be earned before portfolio credits are awarded. n Degree candidates interested in the Portfolio Advantage Program are required to attend a six-session portfolio development workshop. The workshop fee is $850. n Portfolio documents must be submitted within one year of completing the workshop. n Portfolio credit may be awarded only if the learning is appropriate to Hood's general educa - tion requirements, electives and/or specific programs. Based on the quality of writing and construction of the portfolio and the content, credit will be awarded for work equivalent to a grade of C or better. Military Experience Hood recognizes the unique nature of the military lifestyle and has committed itself to easing the transfer of relevant course credits and crediting learning from appropriate military train - ing and experiences. Students need to provide a copy of their DD214 and/or ACE/AARTS transcripts. One credit in physical education is awarded for military basic training. First aid certification will receive elective credit for PE 214. Double-Numbered Courses and Undergraduate Enrollment in Graduate Courses Certain courses have been designated as appropriate for both graduate students and under - graduates. These double-numbered courses are identified by numbers in both the 400 and 500 range. Undergraduate students enroll in a double-numbered course at the 400-level and receive undergraduate credit. Graduate students enroll at the 500-level and receive graduate credit. Undergraduate students must meet different performance standards from the graduate stu - dents. These differences may relate to the quality and/or quantity of work required, and may also involve measures of grading. To be eligible to take a 400/500-level course , undergraduate students must have a cumulative Grade Point Average of 2.0 or better and have earned at least 56 credits, including 12 credits or more at the 200 level or above in the course discipline. 64 UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESTo be eligible to take a 500-level graduate course and receive undergraduate credit , Hood undergraduate students must have earned senior status (87 credits) including 12 credits or more at the 200 level or above in the course discipline; have a cumulative Grade Point Average of 3.0 or better; have a Grade Point Average of 3.0 or better in the major area of study; and complete a petition, verified by the registrar and approved by the Graduate School, the adviser and the instructor. Credit will count only toward the undergraduate degree. To be eligible to take a 500-level graduate course and receive graduate credit , Hood under- graduate students must have earned a minimum of 109 credits and meet the requirements indi - cated above. Credit will not apply toward the 124 credits required for the undergraduate degree. Final Examinations Instructors give final examinations in all courses except those in which special assignments are more appropriate. Instructors inform students of final examination policy at the beginning of the term. Final exam dates are listed in the official Academic Calendar, and students' travel plans must take the dates of scheduled exams into account. No student may reschedule a final examination in order to leave or travel early. In accordance with the Hood College Honor Code, the student may not discuss any final examination in any way with anyone during the final examination period. Final examinations may not be given prior to the start of the desig - nated examination period. Financial Obligations Grades, transcripts, future registrations and diplomas will be withheld until the student has paid all tuition, fees and other bills incurred at the College, and has returned all library books. Grades n Grading Criteria n Grade Changes n The Hood Grade Point Average n The Composite Average n The Major Average n Course Repeat Policy n Midterm Grades n Final Grades n Incomplete Grade Policy n Grade Appeal Grading Criteria Hood's faculty uses the following general criteria in determining grades. Demonstration of the ability to write and speak standard English is included in the grade evaluation of every course. The criteria upon which students will be evaluated is included on every course syllabus. A, A- (90-100) indicates general excellence; the student displays initiative, independence and often originality in the course. B+, B, B- (80-89) indicates an unquestioned grasp of the subject's fundamental facts and princi - ples, an understanding of their significance and an ability to use them effectively; work is logically organized and technically correct; the student often shows initiative and independent work. C+, C, C- (70-79) indicates the student has a fairly accurate knowledge of the subject's funda - mental facts and principles and is able to apply them reasonably well; work is fairly logical in organization and technique but it is incomplete; there is evidence of growth in handling the coursework. D+, D, D- (60-69) indicates work is of inferior quality yet deserving of credit; there is some ac - quaintance with basic facts and principles but work is poorly organized and technically faulty; the student frequently fails to complete assignments. UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 65F (0-59) indicates work shows no grasp of basic facts and principles and is not deserving of credit; it is poorly organized and technically faulty; the student frequently fails to complete assignments. S indicates satisfactory completion of work done on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis; perfor - mance is at a C- level or better. U indicates unsatisfactory completion of work done on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis and not deserving of credit; performance is at a D+ level or lower. INC indicates incomplete work in a course because of illness or serious emergency beyond the student's control; students must arrange to finish assignments in accordance with the College's incomplete grade policy. Grade Changes Instructors have the right to change a grade if they have made an error in computing or record - ing a student's grade. Instructors must notify the Registrar's Office in writing of the error within three weeks after the grades have been issued. Grade changes due to a computational or recording error discovered after the deadline, and requests for grade changes for any other rea - sons, must be submitted by the instructor in writing to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. The Hood Grade Point Average The average that appears on all transcripts and grade reports is the average of all grades earned at Hood. Accepted transfer credit is included in the earned credit total and is applied toward the 124-credit degree requirement, but the quality hours and quality points earned at another institution are not calculated in the Hood average. Foreign language majors and students par - ticipating in a Hood-sponsored, affiliated or approved semester or year abroad program at the University of Seville or the Dominican Republic programs may earn quality points for work accomplished with a passing letter grade Each grade received at Hood on the A-F grading scale has no quality points include: AU, S, U, INC, Z, TR, W By computing the quality points received for each letter grade, students can ascertain their average or grade point average. For example, a grade of \"C\" in a 3-credit course earns 6 qual - ity points. Add the number of quality points earned in each course to learn the quality point total. Divide the quality point total by the total number of credits (in courses which have letter grades) and the result is the Grade Point Average (G.P.A.). The Composite Grade Point Average The composite Grade Point Average is the average of all college work attempted. All grades earned at Hood and those completed at other institutions are calculated, regardless of whether the course credit was accepted for transfer. The composite average is used to determine eligi - bility for various honor societies as well as determining Commencement honors. The Major Average An academic department may refuse to accept as a major a student whose G.P.A. falls under 2.0 in the discipline. The department may require a student who has declared a major to drop the major if the student's G.P.A. falls below 2.0. Course Repeat Policy A student may repeat a course under the following circumstances: n Failure (F, U) in the course previously. n Enrollment in a course on a credit basis after previously auditing the course. n Course description states that a course may be repeated (e.g., MATH 335). 66 UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESUNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 67n Grade of \"C-\" or below has been initially earned in a 100- or 200-level course. Course may be repeated once. n Failure to meet minimum grade required in a prerequisite course. All grades earned for a given course will remain on the academic record and be computed in the Grade Point Average. Credit will be awarded only once. Students may not repeat a course at Hood for which transfer credit has been awarded. Midterm Low Grades Students who earn a low grade at mid-semester (C-, D+, D, D-, F, U or INC) receive a notice of low grade(s). The low grade report does not become a part of the student's permanent record, but is, instead, an indication of the need for corrective action. Final Grades Hood releases final grades electronically to the student and the student's adviser through Self-Service. Final and midterm grades will be forwarded to parents/guardians of first-year students who have signed a release form sent to them the summer before they enter Hood. Incomplete Grade Policy When serious illness or emergency prevents a student from completing the work for a course, instructors may allow additional time to finish assignments. Incompletes are not substitutes for failure to attend classes or to complete assigned work. Limits/Restrictions: 1) The student must file an application for an incomplete grade with the Registrar's Office no later than the last day of classes. 2) An incomplete may not be granted unless a student has completed at least half the work of the course. 3) The student's progress in the course must be passing (D- or above) at the time the incom - plete is requested. 4) The registrar must approve a notation of incomplete and record an INC on the student's permanent record. After the instructor assigns a grade, an \"I\" remains permanently on the record with the final grade earned beside it. 5) The date agreed upon for completion of all assignments may not be later than March 15 for fall semester and October 15 for spring or summer semester. Any request for extension of an incomplete grade must be submitted by the student to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. 6) Work not completed by the deadlines stated above will convert to a grade of zero unless an extension is approved by the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. 7) Students who register for a subsequent semester with more than three credits of incomplete outstanding will have their schedules reviewed and their enrollment registration potentially restricted by the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. As a result of this review, the Committee may limit the course load that a student is permitted to undertake in the subsequent semester. Grade Appeal Grade appeals of the final course grade must be filed in a timely manner. Students must contact the faculty member involved no later than the end of the first week of the semester following the filing of the disputed grade. If the issue is not satisfactorily resolved, the depart - ment chair must be contacted within 30 days of the beginning of the semester. Appeals to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies must be initiated by the last day prior to midsemester recess of the semester following the filing of the disputed grade. A Final Grade Appeal, available in the Registrar's Office, must be completed and submitted with all required documents before the Committee considers the petition. A delay in the filing of a grade appeal constitutes sufficient reason for denial of the appeal by the Committee. The Committee on Academic Standards and Policies will screen out frivolous or unsubstanti - ated appeals and will consider legitimate appeals that fall into the following categories: n Miscalculation of a grade; or, n Assignment of a grade to a particular student by application of more exacting requirements than were applied to other students in the same course. n Assignment of a grade on some basis other than performance in the course. All parties to the grade appeal (student, instructor, chairperson, registrar, committee members) are to maintain strict confidentiality until the matter is resolved. Graduation and Commencement Participation Graduation In the spring of the junior year, the registrar sends rising seniors who plan to graduate in the following year a graduation audit form indicating their progress toward fulfilling degree requirements. This audit begins the graduation clearance process that continues through the senior year. Students should meet with their faculty advisers to review degree requirements and to plan their senior year registrations. In October of the senior year, seniors are sent an Ap - plication for Graduation form to complete and return to the Registrar's Office by November 1. Bachelor degrees are awarded in January, May and September. Commencement Participation Students who have completed all degree requirements by the date grades are due for the sec - ond semester may participate in the May commencement. Students graduating in January participate in the May commencement ceremony. Students com - pleting degree requirements in September participate in the May ceremony the following year. Students may not participate in commencement unless all degree requirements and all financial obligations to the College have been met. Registration and Enrollment n Registration n Drop/Add Period n Course Withdrawal after Drop/Add n Audit n Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grade Plan n Course Schedules n Cancellation of Courses Registration Advising and registration for degree candidates occurs in April for the fall semester and No - vember for the spring semester. Matriculated students are required to meet with their advisers to select courses and review degree progress. The adviser authorizes the student for registra - tion and, on the day indicated on the Academic Calendar, the student registers for classes via Self-Service. Drop/Add Period Students may drop or add courses without academic penalty from the time of registration through the end of the drop/add period. See the Academic Calendar for dates. 68 UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESUNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 69During this period students may also change to or from the SU (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory) grading option (see below), change to or from enrollment on an audit basis, or alter the num - ber of credits in courses carrying variable credit. Course Withdrawal After Drop/Add If a student withdraws from a course after the end of the drop/add period and before the end of the eleventh week of the semester a W (indicating withdrawal) will be noted on the tran - script. This notation will not be computed in a student's grade point average. A student may not withdraw from a class during the last four weeks of classes. Audit With instructor permission, a student may enroll in most lecture courses as an auditor. As the term implies, auditors listen rather than engage in class discussions and projects. Auditors at - tend class regularly but do not write papers or take exams or quizzes. Limits/Restrictions: n The student receives neither credit, grade nor grade points for an audit; however, the audit does appear on the transcript. n There is no limit on the number of courses that a student may audit during a semester. If the audited course or courses cause a student to exceed 18.5 credits, the excess credits will be billed by the undergraduate per-credit-hour fee. n It is not possible to audit courses such as creative writing, painting, drawing, labs and other courses where the nature of the activity requires the participation of the student. Students may enroll on a noncredit basis in such courses by paying the current per-credit-hour fee. n No changes to or from the audit option may be made after the end of drop/add period. n A student may take for credit, at a later time, a course that was previously audited. n Part-time students pay a reduced audit fee to audit a course See Undergraduate Tuition and Financial Aid, Costs. Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grade Plan Hood provides an alternate grade plan as a means of encouraging intellectual curiosity. Under the satisfactory/unsatisfactory option, students receive a grade of \"S\" and credit for work of \"C-\" caliber or better or a grade of \"U\" and no credit for work of \"D+\" or lower quality. Nei - ther grade is computed in the cumulative grade point average. Limits/Restrictions: n Students may not choose the S/U option for any course used to satisfy the Core, in the ma - jor field, the minor field or an independent study. If a course is only offered for S/U credit, this policy does not apply. n Students may choose the S/U option for a maximum of 12 satisfactory/unsatisfactory credits within the total 124 credits Hood requires for graduation. Students spending three years at Hood may choose the S/U option for only 9 satisfactory/unsatisfactory credits to meet graduation requirements; two years, 6 credits; one year, 3 credits. Courses only offered for S/U credit are not counted in these totals. n At registration, students indicate their intent to take a course on the satisfactory/unsatis - factory plan on the course and schedule card. Change from one grading plan to another must have the adviser's approval and must occur before the end of the drop/add period. No changes to or from the satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading system may be made after the drop/add period. n Students are cautioned that some graduate and professional schools and employers look negatively at satisfactory/unsatisfactory on transcripts because actual performance or mastery of the subject has not been demonstrated. 70 UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESCourse Schedules A credit hour usually represents one hour of class work and at least two hours of preparation in a given subject per week throughout the semester. Classes usually meet on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday or a Tuesday-Thursday schedule. Ex - cept for lab sessions, Monday-Wednesday-Friday classes generally convene for 50 minutes and Tuesday-Thursday classes for 75 minutes. Most evening classes meet once a week for 2-1/2 hours or twice a week for 75-minute periods. Classes are held between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 10 p.m. Hood also has blocked courses, which are courses that meet for double periods during a por - tion of the semester. Blocked courses are primarily studio art and education courses in the teaching internship semester. Cancellation of Courses A fall or spring semester course is subject to cancellation when fewer than eight students are enrolled. Summer and January term classes are subject to cancellation when fewer than five students are enrolled. The College reserves the right to cancel the course as late as the first day of classes each semester. Every effort will be made to work with students regarding program planning and placement in alternate courses that would be compatible with the cancelled course. Student Status n Full-time and Part-time Status n Emergency Leave of Absence n Leave of Absence n Withdrawal from the College n Reinstatement after Withdrawal Full-time and Part-time Status Full-time status requires 12 credit hours or more per semester. A typical semester program consists of 15 or 16 credits except in the first year when it may be 12-15 credits. If the Admis - sion Committee decides that a student's skills in writing, math and reading need strengthening and the Basic Skills Inventories further support this decision, the student's adviser will help de - velop a program of 12-15 credit hours, including General Studies 101 and basic skills courses offered through The Josephine Steiner Center for Academic Achievement and Retention. Part-time status is accorded students taking 11.5 credit hours or fewer per semester. Students are normally limited to 12 credits completed during the summer. Exceptions to this credit limit require permission of the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. Students may complete a maximum of three credits during the January session. Limits/Restrictions: n Enrollment in more than 18.5 credits in one semester requires a 3.0 cumulative average and permission from the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. Enrollment in credits beyond 18.5 requires additional tuition for each hour or fraction above that number. n A student may not enroll in two courses which meet at the same hour. Emergency Leave of Absence (ELOA) A student may be granted an Emergency Leave of Absence (ELOA) for a period not to exceed two consecutive weeks within an academic semester. A request for an emergency leave of UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 71absence must be supported with appropriate documentation which is required before the leave is approved. Requests for an emergency leave of absence will be reviewed and approved by the Dean of Students and communicated to the Registrar's Office for a specified period of time. An emergency leave of absence applies to students who must be absent for mental or physi - cal health reasons, military commitments, international travel/documentation or any other personal or family emergency. Students who require an emergency leave of absence beyond the two week period will be withdrawn from the semester. Failure to attend classes by the return date specified on the emergency leave of absence form will result in an automatic administrative withdrawal from the College. Students are asked to consult with appropriate offices/personnel in processing an emergency leave of absence. Such consultations may include conversations with the Financial Aid Office, Residence Life Office, Office of Multicultural Affairs and International Student Programs, Dining Services, ROTC, and the academic adviser. An Emergency Leave of Absence (ELOA) Form may only be obtained from the Dean of Students Office. Leave of Absence Students who need to be away from the College for one or two semesters, but who wish to maintain ties to the College and to resume their studies at a later time, may take a leave of absence instead of withdrawing. Students who do not return from a leave of absence after two semesters will be withdrawn. Students may not request a leave of absence for the remainder of the currently enrolled semester without the written permission of the dean of students. Leave of absence forms are available in the Office of the Registrar. Students do not file a leave of absence form in order to study abroad or at another institution in the U.S. Instead, they must file a petition with the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies for approval for study elsewhere. Withdrawal from the College A student may withdraw from the College at any time during the semester. See Tuition and Financial Aid for refund information. If the withdrawal occurs after the drop/add period, a grade of W will be recorded for each course. Reinstatement after Withdrawal Students in good academic standing at the time of withdrawal and with no holds on future registration are eligible for reinstatement to the College. Reinstatement requests must be sent to the Registrar, indicating: the year and semester of return; if the student will return as a full or part-time student and as a resident or commuter. Students will be readmitted with the major active at the time of withdrawal. Student Information, Records and Transcripts Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 (P.L. 93-380) extends to students the right of access to their education records maintained at the College. The provost, the dean of the Graduate School, and the registrar maintain these records for enrolled and former students. Information and notification as to the type of record; the accessibility of and policies for maintaining, reviewing and expunging the record; and the procedures for inspect - ing, reviewing, obtaining copies of or challenging the record are established by the appropriate offices. 72 UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESStudent Rights and Public Information In accordance with College policy and FERPA, the following items are considered Directory Information and will be released in response to any inquiry, unless the student notifies the registrar in writing that she/he does not wish this information released: class level, major, dates of attendance, name and dates of attendance at other institutions, degrees and dates awarded. Transcripts In compliance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, transcript requests must be in writing and include the signature of the student. Forms are available in the Registrar's Office and online at www.hood.edu/adminservices/registrar.cfm Normal requests are processed within 3-5 working days upon receipt of request. Up to five copies will be processed at no charge. There will be a $5 charge per copy for each request beyond five. Rush transcripts are processed in 24 hours of the next working day at a charge of $10 per copy, payable by cash, check, VISA or MasterCard, due at time of request. Rush service is not available during the beginning and end of the semester, commencement and registration. No transcript will be released if the student has not satisfied all financial obligations to the College. Transfer Policy and Attending Other Institutions Transfer Policy Hood welcomes transfer students from four- and two-year colleges. We have articulation agreements with many community colleges to encourage and assist students in their efforts to take appropriate courses prior to transfer. The registrar evaluates prior college coursework and credit earned through alternative methods for applicability to degree requirements at Hood College. Credit is generally awarded for courses that are clearly applicable to a baccalaureate degree and for which the student earned a grade of C- or above. A maximum of 62 credits may be awarded for freshman/sophomore level work completed elsewhere. Although there is no limit for junior/senior level coursework, stu - dents will be awarded no more than a total of 94 credits for all college-level work completed. The transferability of credits from an institution that is not accredited by a regional accredita - tion agency may be considered upon receipt of documentation that demonstrates equivalency regarding course information, equivalencies and learning outcomes. It is the student's responsi - bility to provide this documentation. The final 30 hours of the degree must be taken on the Hood campus (see Undergraduate Degree Requirements). In addition, the College requires transfer students to take a minimum of 12 credits of classroom instruction in the major discipline at Hood, regardless of the number accepted in transfer. Transfer students must submit their transcripts to the registrar prior to enrollment. All transfer documents must be filed within the first semester of enrollment. The registrar may refuse to award credit if students fail to meet this deadline. All grades earned at Hood and those completed at other institutions are calculated in the com - posite grade point average, regardless of whether the course credit was accepted for transfer. The composite average is used to determine eligibility for various honor societies as well as determining Commencement honors. Degree Students Attending Other Institutions Students may receive credit for coursework successfully completed at another accredited institution during the academic year or the summer with prior approval of the department and the registrar. Students must petition to take a course from another college during any semester or session. The course may not be offered at Hood during that semester/session. Petitions are available in the Registrar's Office. The maximum number of credits that can be taken during the summer is one credit more than the number of weeks in the session for a maximum of 12 UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 73credits. Students may enroll for up to 4 credits during a three-week January term. Credit is granted for grades of C- or above and the grade of TR will appear on the Hood transcript. Community College Exchange Full-time Hood students may take one course each semester at Carroll Community College (CCC) or Hagerstown Community College (HCC) without charge, provided that the course chosen is not offered at Hood during the academic year. CCC also offers the exchange to Hood students during their summer sessions. To register, students obtain the consent of their advisers and the Hood registrar. The registrar will provide a statement of enrollment for reg - istration at CCC or HCC. These transfer course grade appears on the Hood transcript as TR. Grades earned on this exchange program are not computed into the cumulative average but are calculated in the composite G.P.A.

All Hood College Education programs are approved by the Maryland State Department of Education and the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) using nationally recognized standards.ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS 79Education faculty are active in national professional organizations and in local schools as supervisors of students, consultants and researchers. Hood's full-time faculty is supplemented by adjunct faculty who are recognized as distinguished educators. Candidates completing the initial and post-baccalaureate teacher certification programs will gain the requisite knowledge, skills and dispositions to meet national, professional, state and institutional standards. As part of requirements for state and national accreditation, the department is guided by a Conceptual Framework that includes the following vision and mission statements and Institutional Outcomes. Our Vision as a Department The education department envisions developing well-educated and well-prepared teachers and educational leaders who are self-actualized in both intellectual pursuits and pedagogical applications. Mission Statement The mission of the education department is to prepare academically competent and professional educators who are committed to facilitating learning in a culturally diverse society. This mission reflects a commitment to providing a technologically enhanced environment in which to nurture highly skilled educators who have a broad base in the liberal arts, are active learners and are reflective practitioners. Inherent in our mission is the awareness that education is a scholarly pursuit, a science, an art and a profession. In order to meet our vision and mission statements, the education department has framed six Institutional Outcomes that all candidates must meet. These IOs are assessed at various points in the programs of study. Institutional (Department) Outcomes We believe that the education department at Hood College prepares educators who: 1. Demonstrate the subject matter content, pedagogical knowledge, teaching skills and professional dispositions necessary to ensure that all of their students and clients learn. (CONTENT KNOWLEDGE and SKILLS) 2. Use their knowledge of diversity to create learning environments that support the belief that all students can learn. (DIVERSITY) 3. Use assessment data to guide practices that support the belief that all students can learn. (ASSESSMENT) 4. Use technology to enhance learning. (TECHNOLOGY) 5. Communicate effectively with students, parents and colleagues in order to facilitate learning. (COMMUNICATION) 6. Reflect on their practice and are committed to continued professional growth. (REFLECTIVE PRACTICE) Candidates enrolling in the Education Initial Teacher Certification Programs are assessed on these six Institutional Outcomes and their dispositional beliefs (commitment to continuous content knowledge and skills development; belief that all students can learn; belief that consistent and purposeful assessment guides practice and instruction; effective and ethical use of technology will enhance learning; effective communication with all stakeholders will facilitate learning and reflective practice to inform and promote professional growth) as part of program expectations. The education department assesses these professional dispositions through written candidate assessments and through course expectations and can issue a dispositional alert if teacher candidates fail to meet these professional dispositions. Appropriate initial teacher certification professionals may fill out a dispositional alert form with a remediation action plan to notify the candidate of such concerns. Failure to complete the action plan may lead to program dismissal. All initial teacher certification programs (undergraduate and post-baccalaureate) require the candidates who intend to be program completers to use the Chalk and Wire e-Portfolio system to create a program portfolio with specified performance assessments and activities. Candidates 80 ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTSinterested in pursuing teaching certification will enroll in EDUC 204 Foundations of Education as their first education course and receive training on creating their program portfolio. Transfer students will receive e-Portfolio training when they enter the program. Facilities: Several facilities on campus serve as laboratories or curriculum materials centers for the teacher education program. The Onica Prall Child Development Laboratory School, founded in 1929, serves as a nursery school for 3- and 4-year-old children. Students observe and teach in the O.P.C.D.L. School. An elementary science and mathematics classroom and the instructional technology classroom are available to students. In addition, many courses are taught in the Tatem Art Building's \"Smart Rooms,\" which are equipped with instructional technology. Area school districts work cooperatively with the education department in offering numerous field experiences to teacher education students through Professional Development School partnerships. Education students are engaged in continuous and extensive field experiences in the PDS and the O.P.C.D.L. School beginning with their first education course and continuing through program completion.

The music curriculum has the following objectives: development of the enjoyment of music, proficiency in the art of music, guidance in the understanding of music, preparation for a career in music, and preparation for graduate school. Most members of the department are concert artists, some of whom have performed nationally and internationally. Several are recording artists, as well. Facilities: Hood's facilities for the study of music include eight practice rooms with Yamaha studio upright pianos, teaching studios with grand pianos (mostly Steinways), a large pipe organ, a practice organ, a harpsichord, a music-lab computer station and several performing venues: Brodbeck Music Hall, Hodson Auditorium, and Coffman Chapel. Hood also boasts an excellent collection of books, music, CDs and DVDs in the Beneficial-Hodson Library and Information Technology Center. Performances: Students have many performing opportunities through participation in honors recitals; performance labs; choir; chamber singers; the piano, wind, string, jazz, early music and gospel ensembles; and other smaller chamber groups. The choral groups perform several times each semester, including the annual \"Messiah\" performance, and the other ensembles present end-of-the-semester concerts each term. Numerous concerts each year by distinguished guest artists and faculty artists are also held. Credit by audition: Students who have a substantial background in applied music may apply for credit for that study by arranging an audition with the department. A maximum of 4 credits will be awarded, based on the audition. Programs offered: n Music Major (B.A.) Music History and Literature Concentration Music Performance Concentration Piano Pedagogy Concentration n Music History and Literature Minor n Music Performance Minor n Music Performance Certificaten Piano Pedagogy Certificate Applied Music Hood offers individual instruction in piano, organ, harpsichord, violin, viola, cello, string bass, flute, English horn, clarinet, oboe, saxophone, all brass instruments, voice, guitar, composition, and conducting. Beginning instruction in all areas is available with consent of the Department. In all instrumental areas except piano, organ, and harpsichord, students are expected to provide their own instruments. Students may take applied music with or without earning credits. Normally, a student would need to practice about five hours a week for one half-hour* lesson, and eight hours a week for two half-hour lessons. Two half-hour lessons may be combined into one hour lesson each week at the discretion of the instructor. One hour* of credit will be awarded for a semester of weekly half-hour lessons. Students taking applied music for credit must attend three department-approved concerts each semester and are expected to participate in performance labs scheduled throughout the semester. Applied music credits are awarded after the teacher certifies that the student has made reasonable progress, has successfully completed a departmental exam, and has fulfilled the concert and performance requirements. Students must take a departmental exam in each applied area of study every semester, following two semesters of study.84 ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTSThere is a modest fee for lessons and use of the practice rooms; several scholarships are available. A maximum of 4 credits by examination may be earned by students with an extensive background in applied music. For detailed, up-to-date information on the applied music program and policies, please consult the Applied Music Handbook on the Department of Music webpage at www.hood.edu *Hour and half-hour are interpreted in terms of the 50-minute class. Music Ensemble Students may elect to enroll in a music ensemble for credit. String students would normally enroll in string ensemble; wind and percussion students would normally enroll in wind ensemble; voice students would normally enroll in choir, chamber singers, or gospel ensemble; and piano students would normally enroll in piano ensemble and a choral group. Majors in other areas will be assigned as appropriate. Students earn one-half credit for each semester of ensemble and may take up to six semesters of ensemble for a maximum of 3 credits during their Hood careers. Note: in all cases, the appropriate director must approve placement in music ensembles. NURSING DEPARTMENT Director: Carol SnappThe RN to Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.) program at Hood College is designed to build upon the basic education of the registered nurse. This course of study builds upon the registered nurse's previous learning to develop additional skills for the increasing complexity of health care in the 21st century. This is an accomplished by a foundation of liberal arts courses and supplemental nursing education focusing on leadership, research, evidence based practice, critical thinking nursing theory, and communication, among other competencies for professional nursing practice. Program Offered: n Nursing (B.S.N.) PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGIOUS STUDIES DEPARTMENT Professor: David Hein Associate Professors: Karen Hoffman (chair), Stephen Wilson The Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies offers two majors: religion and philosophy. The department also offers minors in religion and philosophy. Five minors are co-sponsored by the department: African Studies, Classical Studies, Middle Eastern Studies, Medieval Studies and Renaissance Studies. The solid liberal arts foundation provided by either of these majors is a good beginning for a career in almost any field, including law, medicine and business. Philosophy and religious studies faculty are distinguished scholars and teachers who have extensive knowledge of the history of philosophy and religious studies, philosophical and religious ethics (theoretical and applied), the religions of Asia, comparative religion, American religious history, the Bible and the Judeo-Christian tradition, as well as the impact of philosophy and religion on culture, politics and public life. Writing across the departmental curriculum: Departmental faculty strongly believe that students who take religion and philosophy courses should not only increase their knowledge but also improve their writing skills. Reading, thinking, writing and intelligent discussion are the principal means by which students engage with the subject matter of courses in religion and philosophy. In their written work, students will reflect clear thinking in clear writing. ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS 85What students say cannot be separated from how they say it. Faculty, therefore, will assess students' papers on the basis of style and grammar as well as content. Programs Offered: n Philosophy Major (B.A.) n Religion Major (B.A.) n Philosophy Minor n Religion Minor PHYSICAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT Assistant Professor: Paul Soong (chair)At a time when the nation is witnessing an obesity epidemic and has an aging population at risk for falls, and the population enjoys watching sports more than playing sports, health science and sport science bring together individuals with backgrounds in physiology and wellness and health education to work on these and many other important public health problems. The Department of Physical Education offers course work directed at increasing student awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle and physical activity and at gaining the skills and understanding basic to a lifetime of wellness. Students have the opportunity to complete lecture classes focusing upon sports science and health education, as well as activity classes focusing upon physical fitness, creative expression, risk-taking and sports skills. Facilities: The College's sports facilities include two swimming pools, two tennis courts, a softball diamond, two playing fields, a one-mile exercise course and Gambrill Gymnasium. Included in Gambrill Gymnasium is a dance studio, gymnasium floor, aerobics room and weight room. The fitness facilities offer treadmills, stair machines and exercise bicycles, as well as weight machines and free weight equipment. Physical Education Programs The basic instruction program in the Department of Physical Education (PE 100-199) is designed to encourage students' personal growth and understanding of the importance of physical activity in their lives. Students have the opportunity to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to enhance their quality of life and establish lifestyles that promote wellness. Courses are directed at physical fitness, creative expression, risk-taking and sports skills acquisition. The PE Core Curriculum requirement may be met by completing 2 credits of physical education activity classes (PE 100-199) or by completing one of the following 3 credit lecture courses: PE 225 Health Maintenance: Stress Assessment and Control, PE 226 Health Maintenance: Physical Fitness, PE 227 Women's Health Issues, PE 228 Life Wellness and Health or PE 250 Introduction to Exercise Physiology. Athletes who participate in intercollegiate sports may be exempted from all or part of the 2-credit physical education activity option. A 1/2 credit of exemption will be granted for each season of participation. No credit is earned for these exemptions.

The major stresses art history, which places works of art in their historical, cultural and artistic contexts. It also offers the student experience in the concepts, methods and materials of archaeology and the history of film. Studio art, providing direct experience with design, drawing, painting and other media, enriches the student's ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY MAJOR 91understanding of the creative process and is also an important component of the curriculum. For art majors, Hood's location near Washington, D.C., and Baltimore is especially valuable. Field trips to the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Dumbarton Oaks, the Walters Art Gallery and other collections allow students to study major works of art firsthand. Internships are available with most of these museums and with advertising agencies, design studios and cultural institutions such as the Library of Congress and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In Hood's Hodson Art Gallery, students may participate in the planning and installation of exhibitions by serving as gallery assistants in ART 300. The concentration offers students a broad perspective on themes fundamental to the humanities. It also prepares students to pursue careers in museums, galleries and other cultural institutions, and provides a basis for graduate work in art history, museum studies, conservation, archaeology and other fields. Students are encouraged to take related courses in history, literature, foreign languages, music, religion and philosophy. Those who plan to earn an advanced degree in art history or archaeology should take French or German in preparation for graduate school. The department strongly suggests that majors spend a semester or year abroad. Requirements for the Major The art and archaeology major with art history concentration requires a minimum of 34 credits in art.

The course of study includes the biology core courses that cover the fundamentals of cell biology, ecology, evolution, genetics and physiology. Elective courses provide for study at greater depth and reflect the breadth of biology. The major allows students to specialize or take a broad range of elective courses as they and their advisers deem appropriate. Elective courses are designed to help prepare students for graduate and professional school and biology-related employment. The capstone experience allows biology majors to synthesize and apply the knowledge and skills gained in earlier coursework and serves as a transition to post-baccalaureate training and employment. Course offerings in the biology department are well balanced and broad, ranging from animal behavior to recombinant DNA technology. In all courses, material focuses on principles and their application to current topics in each of the fields. Advanced, double-numbered elective courses allow qualified seniors to study in depth in their chosen fields. Almost all courses offered for the major include laboratory instruction. Laboratory curricula complement lecture material and emphasize hands-on learning through experimentation. As students progress through the curriculum they are challenged to develop increasingly sophisticated experimental and analytical skills. Some courses also include trips to undertake field research and to tour industrial and research sites of interest. The curriculum for biology majors provides excellent preparation for many different careers. Options for graduates include research positions with government and private agencies in the laboratory or in the field. Students are well prepared for post-baccalaureate programs in medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry, physical therapy and clinical laboratory science. Graduate study in a specialized field of biology is another excellent option for students majoring in biology.

Independent study, Honors research and our Summer Research Institute (where students stay on campus and receive a summer stipend to conduct research) are all means for our students to join the faculty in their research pursuits. We also encourage students to participate in off-campus research opportunities. The College is situated only a few blocks from Fort Detrick, a federal facility housing research laboratories of the National Cancer Institute, U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and U.S. Department of Agriculture. Many of our students complete internships at these nearby laboratories. Internship experiences often lead directly to employment opportunities in the Fort Detrick laboratories or the many biotechnology laboratories of the I-270 technology corridor between Washington, D.C., and Frederick. Students have also completed internships at a number of other locations, including the National Aquarium, Horn Point Environmental Laboratory and the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory. Coastal Studies Semester Hood's Coastal Studies Semester takes place during the fall semester (August to December). The curriculum combines the study of culture and society with science and technology for a truly multidisciplinary approach to learning about environmental science and coastal issues. Interactions with scientists, authors and other environmental professionals in the region augment class discussions, lab investigations and fieldwork. An interdisciplinary research practicum weaves together scientific, historical and cultural threads to unify the semester-long experience. Students earn 14 to 16 semester hours of academic credit through successful completion of courses. The courses offered may vary from year to year. See Coastal Studies Semester for more information on the program. Students can also obtain a minor in Coastal Studies by successfully completing the fall semester and participating in one additional Coastal Studies Field Experience course. These are three-week courses that are offered during January and summer semesters. The minor is largely travel-based and designed to provide students with both textbook and first-hand knowledge of environmental challenges currently facing coastal regions. Consult the Minors section of the catalog for specific information. Duke University Marine Sciences Education Consortium (MSEC) Hood College maintains a close relationship with the Duke University Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, N.C. At the invitation of the University, Hood has made that relationship even stronger by joining the Duke University Marine Sciences Education Consortium. Hood students may use the marine laboratory's facilities for independent study projects and coursework. The marine laboratory is located in a historic coastal town on the Intracoastal Waterway near the Outer Banks and Cape Hatteras. Opportunities for study include field work in a variety of estuarine, salt marsh, beach and open ocean environments. Enrollment at MSEC is administered by the Hood Department of Biology. Hood students transfer credits but not quality points for work completed at the Duke University Marine Laboratory.

COASTAL STUDIES SEMESTER Hood's Coastal Studies Semester takes place during the fall semester (August to December). The curriculum combines the study of culture and society with science and technology for a truly multidisciplinary approach to learning about environmental science and coastal issues. Interactions with scientists, authors and other environmental professionals in the region augment class discussions, lab investigations and fieldwork. An interdisciplinary research practicum weaves together scientific, historical and cultural threads to unify the semester-long experience. Students earn 14 to 16 semester hours of academic credit through successful completion of courses. The courses offered may vary from year to year. The following list represents a sample of possible course offerings: Coastal Community Ecology (4 credits) The Chesapeake Bay: Human Impacts on a Natural System (3 credits)Coastal Oceanography (4 credits) Coastal Studies Practicum (2 credits) During the semester, students and faculty travel throughout the mid-Atlantic region and use nationally known coastal research facilities as a base of operations for one- to two-week intervals. The facilities used may vary from year to year and may include: The Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, Solomons, Md. The Marine Science Consortium at Wallops Island, Va. The Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences' Eastern Shore Laboratory, Wachapreague, Va. Hood College, Frederick, Md. Short stops of one to two days at various other locations of interest, such as the historic St. Mary's City, Jamestowne, Williamsburg or Horn Point and Oxford Laboratories, are an integral part of the semester. Students can also obtain a minor in coastal studies by successfully completing the fall semester and participating in Coastal Studies Field Experiences, which are three-week courses that are offered during January and summer semesters. The Coastal Studies Semester and an additional Coastal Studies Field Experience course comprise the largely travel-based minor, which is designed to provide students with both textbook and first-hand knowledge of environmental challenges currently facing coastal regions.

EDUCATION MAJORS AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS Certification Options Students may enter certification programs as undergraduates majoring in early childhood education (ECE) or dual certification in elementary and special education. Secondary and art education are not majors. Rather, students seeking secondary certification major in an academic field and concurrently complete the secondary program requirements leading to certification eligibility. ECE majors may complete a minor. Multidisciplinary breadth for all students is demonstrated through completion of additional general education courses beyond Hood's Core Curriculum. See program requirements for details. Hood's Department of Education offers teacher certification programs for holders of a baccalaureate degree. They may become certified to teach in early childhood education, dual certification in elementary and special education and secondary education in the subject areas of art (preK-12), biology, chemistry, English, French, history, mathematics and Spanish. A 2.75 G.P.A. on a 4.0 G.P.A. scale in baccalaureate work is required. Students who select this option must meet certification requirements through satisfactory completion of their program's required content and professional education courses. Contact the Admission office 106 EDUCATION MAJORfor more specific information regarding acceptance into and requirements for these programs. All teacher certification programs are approved by the Maryland State Department of Education and the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) using nationally recognized standards. Hood College also meets the Title II requirements of the Higher Education Act. Refer to www.msde.state.md.us for Hood College's Institutional Report or to the Title II Institutional Report attachment in this catalog. Program Components Continuous Field Experiences: Extensive and continuous field experiences are at the heart of the teacher education programs. Beginning in the first education course, students participate in field experiences in local professional development schools. A professional development school (PDS) is a collaborative effort between a public school and Hood College to strengthen and enhance teacher candidates' pre-service professional development within the public school setting. Additionally, PDSs provide continuous professional development to in-service teachers working in the PDS sites, thus providing for the ongoing development of both pre- and in-service teachers. Performance Assessment: In order to begin the intensive, yearlong internship (Phase II/ III) all teacher certification candidates submit an electronic entry folio. Exit folios, submitted during the last semester of the yearlong internship and earning a score of Proficient or better, are required for completion of the certification programs. Exams: Passing the Praxis I and II exams is required for successful certification program completion. Refer to individual programs for details. Grade Point Average (G.P.A.) Requirement: Students must achieve a 2.75 cumulative G.P.A. on a 4.0 scale and a 2.75 G.P.A. in education courses at Hood College for admittance into the extended internship of the teacher certification programs. Students are expected to maintain a 2.75 cumulative G.P.A. in education course work. Furthermore, a student earning a C- or lower in required education courses may not continue in the teacher education programs. Certification: Upon successful completion of one of the teacher education programs and attainment of the Maryland state minimum scores on all state-required Praxis I and II exams, students are eligible for certification to teach in Maryland with reciprocal certification to teach in nearly all other states. It is the student's responsibility to contact individual states other than Maryland for information regarding certification requirements for specific programs. Teacher candidates should also be aware that local school systems may impose additional requirements beyond state certification. Mandatory informational meetings regarding application procedures, portfolio construction and deadlines are held each semester. As with most colleges and universities, there is an additional fee required for the teaching internship, formerly known as \"student teaching.\" Interns are responsible for their own transportation to and from field experiences. Variation from Hood's holiday and vacation schedules may be required to accommodate local school district calendars. e-Portfolio: All education programs require the candidates who intend to be program completers to use the Chalk and Wire e-Portfolio system to create a program e-Portfolio with specified performance assessments and activities. Candidates enrolling in EDUC 204 will begin to post their coursework electronically and will use the e-Portfolio for the remainder of their coursework in education. Transfer students will begin using the e-Portfolio system upon entering the education program at Hood. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION MAJOR, B.A. The early childhood education program is designed to prepare and certify teacher candidates to teach young children. Successful completion of the early childhood education program with the Phase II and Phase III yearlong internship and attainment of Maryland state minimum passing scores on Praxis I and II leads to Maryland state initial teaching certification to teach preschool, kindergarten and grades 1-3. The Phase III teaching internship requires two EDUCATION MAJOR 107placements, one in kindergarten and one in a primary classroom. Beginning in the prerequisite phase, students have the unique opportunity to observe in the Onica Prall Child Development Laboratory School on campus, which offers preschool for children ages 3-4. The ECE program includes many field experiences and is based conceptually on the INTASC Principles and the NAEYC Standards. Requirements for the Early Childhood Education Program Three phases comprise the teacher certification program in ECE, each of which has specific course requirements and field experiences.

Today's special education and general education children are frequently taught together in the same classroom. The philosophy of inclusion supports this approach. The dual certification major strengthens the preparation of teacher candidates to instruct both special education and general education children who will be assigned to their classrooms. It meets the federal requirement for preparing \"highly qualified teachers\" a part of the \"No Child Left Behind\" legislation. Successful completion of the dual certification in elementary/special education program and attainment of Maryland state minimum passing scores on Praxis I and II lead to Maryland initial teaching certification in elementary and special education. Program completers are prepared to teach children with and without disabilities in regular and inclusion classrooms at grade levels 1-8. The focus within special education is on teaching students with mild and moderate disabilities who have learning disabilities, mental retardation and/or emotional disturbance. Additionally, program graduates are prepared to work effectively in collaborative teams of both special and general education teachers and school specialists. The dual certification program in elementary/special education includes many field experiences and a yearlong internship based conceptually on the Maryland State Department of Education's \"Redesign of Teacher Education.\" The yearlong experiences during the final two semesters feature an internship in an elementary classroom and in a special education program.

EDUC 412 S econdary Reading in the Content Area: Part II (3 credits) EDUC 419 T eaching Internship (12 credits) ENGINEERING DUAL DEGREE, B.A./B.S. Engineering is a profession that offers many opportunities to both women and men. A liberal arts background combined with a major in mathematics and technical training gives a prospective engineer an added academic dimension. In cooperation with The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., Hood offers a five-year dual degree program in engineering. Students spend the first three years at Hood as mathematics majors, taking the core courses for engineering and courses in the humanities and social sciences. At the end of the three years at Hood, students transfer to The George Washington University into one of the engineering programs offered there, provided that they complete the designated required courses with a grade of C or better and are recommended by the adviser of this program, the chair of the mathematics department. Advisers at both Hood and George Washington work together to assist in this transfer agreement. At the successful completion of the five-year program, the student is eligible to receive two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Hood College and a Bachelor of Science degree from The George Washington University. The engineering programs available at The George Washington University are biomedical, civil, electrical, computer, mechanical and systems engineering. In order to meet Hood requirements, a student in the dual degree program must complete the Hood College Core Curriculum requirements and must complete a specified set of courses in chemistry, computer science, mathematics and physics. Selection of courses to meet the Core Curriculum requirements and selection of elective courses should be done in careful consultation with a faculty adviser to ensure that the courses taken at Hood will satisfy the requirements of The George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science. In particular, a student must earn 18 to 21 credits in humanities and social science courses that are acceptable to The George Washington University. The following science and mathematics courses must be taken at Hood. CHEM 101, 102 Gener al Chemistry I, II CS 284 Co mputer Science I MATH 320 Modeling and S imulation or MATH 456 Numerical Analysis MATH 112 A pplied Statistics MATH 201, 202 Calculus I, II MATH 207 Discr ete Mathematics MATH 253 Multivar iable Calculus MATH 304 Diff erential Equations to Linear Alg ebra MATH 351 P robability and Statistics MATH 440 Intr oduction to Abstract Algebra MATH 453 Intr oduction to Real Analysis MATH 470 S enior Seminar: History of Mathematics PHYS 203, 204 Intr oductory Physics I, II PHYS oduction to Modern Physics PHYS 325 Electr icity and Magnetism (MATH 320 is required for prospective electrical engineering students.)ENGLISH MAJOR 113ENGLISH MAJOR, B.A. The English department offers a variety of courses designed to expose the student to a wide range of literary texts and critical approaches. In English classes, students read, analyze and write about literature from a number of historical periods. The faculty provides the personal attention that enables each student to learn to write well, to think critically and thus to acquire the skills necessary for success in any profession. We believe that such study enhances the love and appreciation of literature, exercises the imagination and frees the mind from credulity and conformity. Requirements for the Major English majors must take a minimum of 30 credits in English at or above the 200 level, 15 credits of which must be 300 level or above (excluding independent study and internships). Six credits in English, exclusive of independent study and internships, must be taken during the senior year. Transfer students must complete at least 12 credits in English at Hood. The senior seminar (ENGL 470) must be taken at Hood. Students will choose one of three concentrations: Literature, Creative Writing or Drama and Theatre.

The department advises that students aiming for graduate study complete a minimum of 36 credits in history at the 200 level or above; choose an informal concentration within the major; take four courses in cognate fields of study (archaeology, art history, English, economics, political science, philosophy, religion and sociology, among others); and become proficient in at least one foreign language. History is also an excellent preparation for law school and other professional programs. Students interested in such a career path should consult the appropriate pre-professional adviser. Students preparing for law school are advised to take courses in American and British history, with additional coursework in English, economics and philosophy. HONORS PROGRAM The Hood College Honors Program is a four-year program of coursework, co-curricular events and extracurricular activities. Academically exceptional first-year students and transfer students are encouraged to apply to the program. Honors courses, which are designed to cultivate students' ability to examine our complex world, are interdisciplinary in approach and are often team-taught. Classes are small, discussion-oriented and enhanced by guest speakers and field trips. The Honors Program includes the following requirements: 6 credits of Honors coursework during first year. 6 credits of Honors coursework during sophomore year.9 additional credits of Honors coursework during sophomore, junior and senior years.1 104-level foreign language course (or exemption).124 HONORS PROGRAMFirst-Year Honors Experience First-year students in the Honors Program take two Colloquium courses organized around interdisciplinary themes. In the first semester (HON 101) the course emphasizes the humanities and social sciences. The second semester (HON 102) explores a theme related to the natural sciences. Sophomore Year Honors Experience The sophomore year in Honors (HON 201 and HON 202) helps students to explore the nature of knowledge, cultural differences and the individual's place in society. During the second semester (HON 202) students combine scholarly research with experiential learning. By invitation, selected Hood students may begin the program at the sophomore level. These students are exempt from HON 101 and HON 102. Junior and Senior Years Students in the Honors program will complete two 300 level electives and HON 470, Seminar in Honors. Students who study abroad for at least one semester may count that experience as one of their honors electives. Students who complete a two-semester departmental honors paper (499) may count that as one of their Honors electives. Honors students may begin taking their electives in the sophomore year. Because Honors electives are offered on an irregular schedule, students who are especially interested in a particular elective are urged to take it the first time it is offered during their eligible years. Honors Program Thesis As an alternative to a departmental honors thesis, students in Hood's Honors Program may elect to complete a 3-credit interdisciplinary paper or project (HON 499) during the fall or spring semester of the senior year. Relationship to the Core Curriculum Most Honors courses may be used to meet Core Curriculum requirements. First-year students and sophomores may apply up to 9 credits toward the 21-23 credits required in the Methods of Inquiry section of the Core Curriculum. (There is a 3-credit limit for any one category. No Honors credit may be applied to the laboratory science requirement. Honors credit may be applied to only one of the Aesthetic Appreciation requirements.) Most Honors elective courses satisfy requirements in the Civilization section of the Core. Foreign Language Requirement All students in the Honors Program must meet the 104-level foreign language course requirement. Students for whom English is a second language should consult with the Honors director to determine possible exemption from this requirement. Transferring into the Honors Program The Honors Program welcomes qualified transfer students. Those who have successfully completed two years of an honors program at another college before they transfer to Hood may apply to the Hood College Honors Program at the junior level without having to complete the first-year and sophomore Honors courses at Hood. Such students must take a minimum of 9 credits in Honors Program courses (two electives and HON 470) in order to complete the program. Students who transfer to Hood in their sophomore year, or students who transfer in their junior year without having completed two years of an honors program at another college, may also apply to the Honors Program. They must take a minimum of 14 credits in Honors Program courses (usually HON 201, HON 202, two electives and HON 470). Sophomore transfers who complete HON 201 and HON 202 may exempt two courses from the Methods of Inquiry section of the Core (not a lab science and no more than one course in Aesthetic Appreciation).LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES MAJOR 125Transfer students should be aware of the Honors Program foreign language requirement (see above). Recognition of Honors Students To graduate from the Honors Program, students must maintain a cumulative G.P.A. of 3.25. A grade of \"C-\" or better is required in each Honors course being used to satisfy the Program requirements. In meeting the Honors Program requirements, students will earn Honors Program recognition on their academic records. LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES MAJOR, B.A. Director: Maria Griselda Zuffi The Latin American studies major is a multidisciplinary program that has a long tradition in universities throughout the U.S. Students who are interested in democracy and culture, human rights, international affairs, literature and languages, and wish to explore from different perspectives the diverse regions of Latin America and the Caribbean should consider this academic program. Students will be prepared to work at international, governmental and private organizations dealing with the region or to continue graduate studies in the field. Given the proximity to the Washington, D.C., area, many students have internships at various associations, centers and organizations dedicated to the region. Students who are interested in issues involving the U.S. Latino communities may consider working in outreach programs in Maryland or Washington, D.C. The Latin American studies program sponsors many events and invites writers, activists, policy makers and film critics to enhance the knowledge and experience of the students in the program. A number of summer grants are available for students who intend to undertake research projects in a Latin American country. The major consists of 33 credits, 15 credits of which must be at the 300 level or above. The required courses provide a strong background in literature and culture from the colonial era to the present. For these foundational courses, competency in Spanish is necessary. Students may consider taking courses in English while taking intermediate language courses if they do not meet the competency level required (at or above the 200 level). Students are required to study abroad at least one semester at a Latin American university. Through Hood's educational exchange programs, students have the opportunity to study in Chile, the Dominican Republic and Peru. Students should plan their studies with the program director before going abroad. Requirements for the Major 15 credits in Latin American literature and culture at or above the 200 level from the following: LSSP 215 Hispanic and L atino Film LSSP 220 L atin America Today LSSP 240 L atin American Literature and Popular Culture LSSP 333 L atin American Poetry LSSP 336 L atin American Fiction 9 credits from the following courses in at least two disciplines.

It helps students understand, from a variety of perspectives, how an individual's life is influenced by laws and how social institutions are created and regulated by law. This program gives students a liberal arts education while preparing them for law-related careers in such areas as court services, corrections, advocacy groups, law enforcement, civil rights organizations, regulatory agencies and women's rights groups, as well as state, local and federal government. Majors may also enter law school or related graduate programs in areas such as justice studies, criminology and public policy. An internship, usually during the junior or senior year, is recommended strongly. Recent internship sites include congressional offices, affirmative action programs, juvenile courts, judges' offices, law firms, the U.S. Attorney's Office, prisons, consumer action agencies, city and state legislative offices and women's advocacy organizations.

MANAGEMENT MAJOR, B.A. The management program is designed to prepare students for leadership careers in complex organizations in the public, private and nonprofit sectors of an increasingly global economy and diversified workplace. Our differentiating niche is a strong emphasis on business functions, social accountability, global awareness, quantitative and qualitative analytical skills, and synergy between theory and practice. Because tomorrow's managers will face intense competitive pressures and strong demands for competency, flexibility and accountability, the management program provides a curriculum that builds core competencies and embeds that core curriculum in a liberal arts program. The management faculty members, who are active in teaching, scholarship and mentoring, aim to create a collaborative teaching and learning environment. Majors are required to participate in our lecture series and to spend either a semester, year or summer studying abroad or in an internship in a major international city such as Washington, D.C. (International students are exempt from the study abroad and internship requirement.) Majors are also encouraged to work with a faculty member in management on at least one research project. All management degrees, B.A. and M.B.A., and minors are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP). Common Body of Knowledge Management Core Management students are expected to have the following competencies: knowledge about the different functional areas of business, quantitative and qualitative analytical skills, and the ability to relate organizations to the greater society in which they exist. The management core, which consists of 15 courses, enables students to achieve these competencies. Every management major has to fulfill the management core requirement. The courses denoted with an asterisk (*) must be taken at Hood. Requirements for the Major All majors must take the following management courses (33 credits): MGMT 205 P rinciples of Management MGMT 281 P rinciples of Financial Accounting MGMT 284 P rinciples of Managerial Accounting MGMT 301 O rganizational Theory and Behavior* ECMG 303 of Investment* P rinciples Strategic Management* MGMT 454 L egal Environment of Business All majors must also take the following courses (10-12 credits): ECON 200 P rinciples of Economics or ECON 205 Principles of Macroeconomics and ECON 206 Principles of Microeconomics ECMG 212 S tatistics for Economics and Management or MATH 112 Applied Statistics ECON 306 Micr oeconomic Analysis Majors are also required to participate in a study abroad semester, year or summer or an internship (MGMT 399\u20143 credits).128 MATHEMATICS MAJOR(International students are exempt from the study abroad and internship requirement.)

MATHEMATICS MAJOR, B.A. The field of mathematics offers a variety of excellent career opportunities. The department offers both a major and a minor in mathematics; mathematics majors may also earn secondary teaching certification. Mathematics courses at Hood are taught with an emphasis on student participation, active learning, collaboration and the use of technology. Students at Hood work closely with faculty MATHEMATICS MAJOR 129members. Classes are small, and students can explore topics that interest them. The senior seminar, in the history of mathematics, is student-organized and student-run. The department has a computer laboratory dedicated to mathematics classes, with computational and graphics software to support the mathematics curriculum. Classrooms, labs, seminar rooms and informal spaces in the Hodson Science and Technology Center provide attractive and useful facilities for student-faculty interaction. Math students are among the most active and involved on campus. They are leaders in student government and in residential and commuter student groups. Members of the math club organize field trips to the Smithsonian, the Maryland Science Center and the National Cryptologic Museum. Math students participate in the annual national competition in mathematical modeling, attend conferences and give presentations, are members of professional organizations, complete exciting internships in Washington D.C., and Baltimore, participate in summer research programs and enter graduate school or the work force with valuable skills. Requirements for the Major A student may declare a major in mathematics only after completing MATH 202 Calculus II or equivalent with a grade of C or better. The following courses comprise the mathematics major: CS 284 Co mputer Science I MATH 112 A pplied Statistics MATH 201-202 Calculus I, II MATH 207 Discr ete Mathematics MATH 253 Multivar iable Calculus MATH 304 Diff erential Equations or MATH 351 Probability and Statistics MATH 320 Modeling and S imulation or MATH 456 Numerical Analysis MATH 333 Intr oduction to Abstract Mathematics MATH 339 Linear Alg ebra MATH 440 Intr oduction to Abstract Algebra MATH 453 Intr oduction to Real Analysis MATH 470 S eminar: The History of Mathematics The mathematics major can be combined with other disciplines (such as biology, chemistry, economics or management) in a double-major program; this option is particularly useful for those interested in the use of quantitative methods in the other discipline. The mathematics major also can complement study in another discipline that is less directly related to it; the broader a student's background, the more choices and opportunities are available. Secondary Education Certification Mathematics majors may wish to obtain certification to teach mathematics at the secondary level. Students who complete the secondary education program receive certification to teach in Maryland upon graduation, along with reciprocity for teaching in certain other states. Students must complete the requirements for the mathematics major plus the following mathematics courses: MATH 335 T eaching Assistantship in Mathematics, 3 credits, at least one of which must be associated with a 100- or 200-level course in the Department of Mathematics MATH 336 Intr oduction to Modern Geometry Students pursuing certification must choose: MATH 304 Diff erential Equations MATH 320 Modeling and S imulation in the list of courses required for the major.130 MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES MAJORIn addition, students must meet the requirements specified under Education, Secondary Education Certification. Students who are considering seeking secondary education certification in mathematics should consult with the Departments of Mathematics and Education as soon as possible. MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES MAJOR, B.A. Director: Donald Wright The Middle Eastern Studies major is a multidisciplinary program that is unique in nature for a liberal arts college. It focuses on history, cultural, language and political thought. Students interested in democracy and culture, human rights, international affairs, literature and languages, and wish to explore from different perspectives the diverse region of the Middle East, should consider this academic program. The primary focus of the program is to prepare students, through their contacts with faculty members from various disciplines, to lead the world of tomorrow through the political and cultural tensions of today. Students who choose to study the Middle East will graduate with a well-rounded and excellent knowledge of all aspects of the region. The study of Arabic is essential to the field; students will finish with a good knowledge of the language to be able to pursue further study at The American University in Cairo. Given the proximity to the Washington, D.C., area, many students have internships at various associations, centers and organizations dedicated to the region. Students who are interested in issues involving the Middle East may consider working in outreach programs in Maryland or Washington, D.C. The Middle Eastern studies program sponsors many events and invites writers, activists, policy makers and film critics to enhance the knowledge and experience of the students in the program. A number of grants are available for students who intend to undertake research projects in the Middle East. Students have the opportunity to study one year or one semester at The American University in Cairo, the foremost institution in the Middle East for Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies.

The Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies recognizes that the fields of philosophy and religious studies, although distinct, nonetheless share many concerns and approaches, and often address the same issues. Consequently, departmental faculty strongly recommend that students with philosophy majors and minors also take religion courses.134 POLITICAL SCIENCERequirements for the Major The major requires a minimum of 30 credits in philosophy at the 200 level or above, including the following philosophy courses: PHIL 200 Co ntemporary Philosophical Topics or PLWS 203 Philosophical Issues in Feminism PHIL 207 L ogic PHIL 221 Ethics PLRL 301 Indian Thought or PLRL 306 Chinese Thought PHIL 307 Histor y of Philosophy: The Ancient World to the Renaissance PHIL 308 Histor y of Philosophy: The Early Modern Era to the Twentieth Century PLRL 470 S eminar Three electives, including at least one at the 300 level In addition to courses with a PHIL or PL designation, HNMU 318 Theory and Practice in the Arts: The Philosophy of Music, REL 304 Islam and REL 342 From Abolitionism to Human Rights will count as philosophy electives within the 30 credit minimum required for the philosophy major. Department faculty urge students who wish to pursue graduate study in philosophy to take more than the minimum number of hours required to complete a major. Although the courses listed below may not be counted as electives within the philosophy major or minor, the philosophy faculty commend them to students as worthy complements to their philosophy courses: AFPS 353 Co ntemporary African Political Thought rican-American Political Thought AFAM 470 Af rican-American Feminist Thought ART 350 Classic al Art and Archaeology HIST 200 The A ncient World PSCI 333 Moder n Political Thought POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR, B.A. A major in political science prepares students for a wide variety of careers in the public or private sectors, such as law; public administration at local, state or federal levels; or community advocacy. Combined with study in related disciplines, the political science major is a strong liberal arts program. It also is suitable for a double major combined with economics, history, management or a similar discipline. The political science courses cover four areas in the discipline: U.S. politics and policy, comparative politics and international relations, law and political theory. Students are encouraged to take courses in each of these concentrations. Students who plan to do graduate work in political science or public administration should take courses at the 300 and 400 level in as many of these concentrations as possible. In addition, they are encouraged to take statistics and economics in preparation for graduate study. Students interested in careers in public service or international relations are strongly encouraged to develop proficiency in at least one foreign language. Those who plan to enter law school should work closely with the College's pre-law advisers and should also take courses in economics and logic to improve their research and writing skills. Internships are recommended and are available at local, state and federal levels. Because of Hood's location near Washington, D.C., and within reach of the state capital, students have an unparalleled opportunity to observe firsthand the workings of government. Hood cooperates with the Washington Semester Program at American University. The department also provides students with a number of opportunities to participate in simulations of political processes, including simulations of the European Union, the Maryland legislature and the United Nations. Political science faculty serve as advisers for these activities.SOCIAL WORK MAJOR 135The political science major provides students with an introduction to decision making at various levels of government, an understanding of public policy formation and of the correlation between political and economic problems. It also provides experience in research and access to computer facilities both at the College and the Library of Congress, an exposure to the practical world of politics and an appreciation of the need for good writing skills. Requirements for the Major The major in political science requires 36 credits of political science courses at the 200 level or above, including the following: PSCI 203 Intr oduction to U.S. Politics PSCI 205 Methods of P olitical Inquiry PSCI 210 Co mparative Politics or PSCI 215 International Relations PSCI 303 P ublic Policy Analysis PSCI 333 Moder n Political Thought PSCI 470 S eminar on Politics Students are required to take one of the following courses: PSCI 202 W omen and Politics PSCI 336 Gender and the L aw AFPS 240 Af rican-American Politics HSPS 245 Global P erspectives on Women, Power and Politics It is recommended that political science majors take ECON 205 Principles of Macroeconomics. In addition, competency in a foreign language is recommended. 15 additional credits in political science are required for the completion of the major. PRE-PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION Pre-law Studies Although there is no specific pre-law curriculum, a strong foundation in the liberal arts, with emphasis on such subjects as English language and literature, political science, sociology, philosophy and logic, history or economics is highly recommended. Virtually all law schools require the Law School Admission Test for admission. Students intending to go to law school directly after graduation should visit the Career Center to receive assistance with program planning and with the law school application process. Pre-medical and Pre-dental Studies Health Professions Adviser: Tiziana Cavinato, Catherine Filene Shouse Career Center Medical schools prefer students who have a broad background in the humanities and social sciences. The following courses, specified in the Medical School Admissions Requirements, are most often the minimum required by professional schools in the United States and Canada. These courses should be completed by the end of the junior year. BIOL Courses 8 cr edits of biology at the 200 level (BIOL 202 and BIOL 203 are recommended) CHEM 101 and 102 Gener al Chemistry I and II CHEM 209 and 210 O rganic Chemistry I and II ENGL 100, 101 or 110-139 English co mposition course, plus another semester of a writing-intensive course PHYS 101 and 102 Gener al Physics (requires MATH 120) or PHYS 203 and 204 Intr oductory Physics I and II (requires calculus) The courses listed below are strongly recommended, but not strictly required, by professional schools. These courses are also best completed by the end of the junior year in order to prepare for the Medical College Admission Test or the Dental Admission Test. Each student should decide, in consultation with a member of Hood's Health Professions Advisory Committee, whether or not to take additional science courses.136 PSYCHOLOGY MAJORBIOL 307 Human A natomy and Physiology I BIOL 316 Genetics BIOL 331 Micr obiology BIOL 339 Cel l Biology CHEM 301 Biologic al Chemistry I Most schools require a year of English, some require calculus and many encourage the study of philosophy or ethics. Hood's Health Professions Advisory Committee members not only provide advice on preparation for medical, dental and veterinary schools, but also write composite letters of recommendation to accompany an eligible student's applications. Although biology, biochemistry and chemistry are the majors most often chosen, the student may major in any area. In any case, the student must earn a competitive grade point average (3.5 or higher is typical of successful candidates) and must show proficiency in the sciences. The selection of courses and choice of major should be discussed with the health professions adviser or a member of the Health Professions Advisory Committee early in the student's program. The MCAT and DAT tests are given throughout the year. The appropriate test should be taken in the spring or early summer of the junior year after the student has had the minimum science courses listed above. Five important factors in being admitted to medical or dental school are: 1. The undergraduate cumulative average; 2. The results of the Medical College Admission Test or Dental Admission Test; 3. Evaluations from Hood faculty and the Health Professions Advisory Committee; 4. A personal interview, if the professional school requests it; 5. Off-campus experience in community service or in health professions activities. For more information, please feel free to talk with the health professions adviser or any member of the Health Professions Advisory Committee. Pre-Veterinary Studies Health Professions Adviser: Tiziana Cavinato, Catherine Filene Shouse Career Center Admission into a veterinary school is among the most difficult of any post-baccalaureate program. Veterinary medical schools require students to be prepared with a strong grounding in the sciences (in particular biochemistry, chemistry and microbiology) balanced by coursework in the humanities, social sciences and mathematics. In addition to demonstrating exceptional ability in the classroom, most veterinary schools also expect students to have had hands-on experience under the tutelage of an experienced veterinarian. Students interested in entering the veterinary profession should contact the health professions adviser for information about the application process and veterinary schools. PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR, B.A. The major in psychology covers aspects of human and animal behavior ranging from the firing of a single neuron to the death and dying process. Psychology can prepare students for various entry-level jobs in social services, mental health, management or almost any area that requires a broad liberal arts education. The psychology major can also be the basis for admission to graduate or professional training in psychology, medicine and law, for example. The possibilities can include many other areas and can be enhanced by the selection of elective courses and participation in complementary experiences.PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR 137Opportunities exist for internships, and in the past, students have worked with hospitalized children, adolescents and adults in outpatient treatment facilities and community mental health agencies, as well as a number of business settings. Previous settings include: the National Institute of Mental Health, The Johns Hopkins University Hospital, Fort Detrick (NCI), the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the White House, Monocacy Neurodevelopmental Center, the Maryland School for the Deaf, the American Psychological Association, the Jefferson School, the Frederick County Hotline, and the National Park Service. Requirements for the Major Psychology majors must complete a minimum of 35 credits in psychology, including at least 23 credits at the 300 level or above. A minimum of 12 credits in psychology must be taken at Hood. Foundation Requirements (14 credits) All foundation courses must be completed with a grade of C- or better to count in the major and to fulfill the prerequisite for higher level courses. PSY 101 Intr oduction to Psychology PSY 211 Elementar y Statistics * PSY 312 N on-Experimental Research Methods PSY 315 Exper imental Research Methods *Statistics courses completed in another discipline will fulfill the requirement but will not count toward the 35 credit minimum in psychology courses.

All majors must take the ETS's Major Specific Test in their senior year. 2. All majors are encouraged to complete at least one complementary experience along with their major in psychology. Complementary experiences include, but are not limited to: a research assistantship (requires faculty approval) an internship (requires departmental approval) an Honors Project (requires departmental selection) a foreign language proficiency or study abroad (see College catalog) a teaching assistantship (requires faculty selection) an independent study (requires faculty approval) a double major or minor(s) (see College catalog) Students should consult with their advisor about which complementary experiences are best for them depending on their long-term goals and short-term plans after graduation. 3. Majors can expand their interests in psychology by including any of the following electives: PSY 203 S urvey of Clinical, Community, and Counseling Psychology PSY 204 P sychology of Death PSY 206 P sychology of Women PSY 208 P sychology of Adolescence PYSO 221 S ocial Gerontology AFPY 270 Af rican-American Psychological Perspectives PSY 319 D rugs and Behavior PSY 335 T eaching Assistantship in Psychology138 RELIGION MAJORPSY 370 S eminar in Contemporary Issues (topics vary) PSY 373 P sychology of Aging PSY 375 Independent S tudy in Psychology PSY 399 Inter nship in Psychology PSY 434 T ests and Measurements PSY 456 Behavior Modif ication RELIGION MAJOR, B.A. The religion major acquaints students with the world's major religious traditions and helps students develop a critical understanding of the issues involved in the academic study of religion. The Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies recognizes that the fields of philosophy and religious studies, although distinct, nonetheless share many concerns and approaches, and they often address the same issues. Consequently, departmental faculty strongly recommend that students with religion majors and minors avail themselves of opportunities to enroll in philosophy courses. Requirements for the Major The major requires a minimum of 30 credits in religion at the 200 level or above, and must include the following religion courses: REL 200 W hat Is \"Religion\"? REL 412 My th, Symbol and Ritual PLRL 470 S eminar At least one of the following courses: REL 203 O ld Testament REL 204 N ew Testament REL 212 The Chr istian Heritage At least one of the following courses: REL303 Judaism AFRL311 Bla ck Theology PSRL310 P olitics Spirituality: Contemporary Issues HNRL320 Liber ation Theologies At least two of the following courses: REL 304 Islam PLRL 301 Indian Thought PLRL 306 Chinese Thought Three electives, at least one of which must be a REL course at the 300 level. In addition to any religion courses, HIST 406 Religion, Family and Society in Reformation Europe; PHIL 307 History of Philosophy: The Ancient World to the Renaissance; PHIL 308 History of Philosophy: The Early Modern Era to the 20th Century; and PHIL 314 The American Intellectual Tradition may count as electives in the 30-credit minimum required for the religion major. Recommendations: The department recommends that students who intend to pursue graduate studies in the Judeo-Christian tradition satisfy the requirements for the religion major by taking electives in the Judeo-Christian tradition. The department recommends that students who intend to pursue graduate studies in world religions take REL 303, REL 304, PLRL 301, PLRL 306 and REL 375 (Independent Study) either in satisfying the above requirements or among their electives.SOCIAL WORK MAJOR 139Department faculty urge students who intend to pursue a higher degree in religious studies to take more than the minimum number of hours required to complete an undergraduate major. Although the courses listed below may not be counted as electives within the religion major or minor, the religion faculty commend them to students as worthy complements to their religion courses: ART 201 Meaning and Method in Ar t ART 220 Histor y of Art I ART 221 Histor y of Art II ART 308 My ths, Saints, and Symbols ART 351 Medie val Art CL 202 My thology CL 302 Classic al Mythology HON 308 Dante and Giotto SOCIAL WORK MAJOR, B.A. Director: Joy Swanson Ernst The social work program is accredited for undergraduate social work education by the Council on Social Work Education. The social work major, based on a foundation in the liberal arts, provides professional preparation for employment in social work, social services and other fields of human service. Graduates are prepared for generalist social work practice, useful in a variety of practice settings, including child welfare, corrections, services to older adults, community organization, mental health, family services and health services. Beyond the liberal arts core, students majoring in social work must complete courses in four basic sequences: human behavior and the social environment, social research, social policy and social service institutions and social work methods. Particularly important is the field practicum during senior year, where students apply social work theories of practice and research in one of a variety of settings. Specific practice settings vary each year, but may include child welfare or adult care in county departments of social service, crisis care for abused women and children, family preservation services in private agencies, group care for middle school and high school age youth, school social work services, nursing homes and assisted living centers and residential and traditional mental health services. The choice of field setting is tailored to interests and learning needs of individual students. Often the field experience leads to employment upon graduation. In addition, successful completion of the undergraduate degree may result in advanced standing for graduate social work studies. The College does not award credit through portfolio evaluation for social work courses. The program actively subscribes to Hood's policies regarding nondiscrimination in employment and student admissions. Requirements for the Major The social work major requires foundation courses from a number of different liberal arts disciplines plus specialized social work courses, including one elective in social work and one from the list of recommended electives in a social or behavioral science. Many of the foundation courses meet Core Curriculum requirements. (Note: Social work students must gain an understanding of biological development across the life span. At Hood, this requirement is fulfilled with BIOL 132 or BIOL 138. Coursework completed at other colleges will satisfy this requirement only if exclusively devoted to human biology.) A grade of \"C-\" or above is required in all courses with a SOWK prefix and in SOC 260 and SOC 261.

Each spring, assessment of student qualifications is conducted by the social work faculty and members of the program's advisory committee. Each student must have completed SOWK 201 with a grade of \"C+\" or better and have an overall minimum G.P.A. of at least 2.5. Students are evaluated on the basis of their emotional maturity and stability, as evidenced by a personal statement, an in-person interview and an evaluation by a supervisor for the volunteer experience (required for SOWK 201). Students who do not wish to major in social work or who are not accepted into the program may choose the minor, pre-professional practice in social work. SOCIOLOGY MAJOR, B.A. Sociology is the study of social life and the social forces that shape human experience. Students who major in sociology are prepared for a wide range of careers in areas such as social action, social research, human services and administration in government agencies, schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations and social agencies. Many sociology majors continue their education 140 SOCIOLGOY MAJORSPANISH MAJOR 141and pursue professions such as city and community planning, research, politics, social policy, administration, criminology, law, social work and higher education. The sociology major provides a strong foundation in sociological theory and research skills. Students also may take elective courses in a variety of more specialized subjects, such as social problems, gender, social inequality, ethnicity and criminology. Many sociology majors undertake an internship or independent study as part of their program. Students have received credit for internships in government agencies, courts, law firms, political campaigns, women's organizations, school systems, group homes for delinquents, research firms and health care agencies. Internships are individually arranged for students with specialized interests and career plans. Requirements for the Major The sociology major requires a minimum of 30 credits in sociology. The following sociology courses are required (21 credits): SOC 101 P rinciples of Sociology SOC 259 S ociological Theory SOC 260 Methods of S ocial Research SOC 261 Q uantitative Methods for the Social Sciences SOC 470 S eminar in Sociology SOC 472 A dvanced Methods of Social Research SOC 482 P racticum in Social Research Choose at least two from the following (6 credits): SOC 300 S ocial Inequality SOC 311 S ociology of Gender SOC 318 Global S ocial Problems SOC 323 Ethnicit y in the United States To complete the requirements, students may select from among a number of different elective courses in sociology. SPANISH MAJOR, B.A. The Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures offers a major in Spanish that, in addition to providing a deep understanding of the Spanish language and culture, gives a new perspective on the English language and American culture. The major also prepares students for graduate studies or for careers in teaching, government, business, industry and international organizations. Spanish majors must spend a semester in a Spanish-speaking country or live for two years in the Spanish House. This residence is under the leadership of a young Spanish or Latin American student. Internships are available for qualified Spanish majors. Recent internship sites have included the Organization of American States, the Mexican Embassy, the National Association of Cuban American Women, The Maryland Governor's Commission on Hispanic Affairs, AYUDA and ASPIRA in the nearby Washington, D.C., area and the Servicios Industriales Pe\u00f1oles in Mexico. Placement Examinations Online advanced placement in Spanish is available to incoming first-year students. Before registration, first-year students should arrange to take the department's placement examination. Those who place in the 103 section of their intended language will receive 3 additional credits; those who place in 203 or a civilization course of their intended language will receive 6 additional credits; and those who place in 207, 208 or a 300-level course will receive 9 additional credits. In all cases, students will receive the extra credits only if they enroll in one of these courses within the first semester at Hood and complete it with a grade of \"C\" 142 MUSIC CERTIFICATE PROGRAMSor better.

The purposes of the program of minors are as follows: n To provide opportunities for students to pursue in a focused and integrated manner programs of study not currently available as majors; n To use existing resources to provide distinctive and challenging curricular opportunities; n To provide an alternative to double majors for students who wish to pursue more than one program of study. n To integrate further the liberal arts and career preparation through opportunities to combine a liberal arts major with a career-related minor or a career-related major with a liberal arts minor; and n To enable graduates to prepare for careers or further study in more than one area of concentrated knowledge. The grouping of courses in a minor may be identical to a concentration. However, a concentration is elected by students within a major, while a minor is elected by students majoring in another field. The minor consists of a minimum of 15 credits of course work, forming a coherent program relating to a specific academic objective. Students are allowed to have two majors and a single minor, or a major and two minor fields. Minors are not required of students. The following are requirements for a minor: n A minimum of 12 credits in the minor must be taken outside the student's major and may not overlap with the major. If there is additional overlap, the credit must count in the major. The course may be used to fulfill a requirement in the minor, but the credit may count only in the major. n If a student elects a second minor, a minimum of 12 credits must be taken outside the first minor. Courses may be used to fulfill requirements in both minors, but the credit may count only in one minor.MINORS 145n Students must have a Grade Point Average of 2.0 and a minimum of 9 credits completed at Hood College for the minor to be listed on the academic record. n A maximum of 21 credits may be counted in the minor. n Courses counted in the minor may also count in the Core. n Declarations of a minor occur during the spring semester of the junior year when students submit the graduation audit, listing their intended minor field, to the Registrar's Office. n Students may develop their own minor, with the approval of the department or departments that are teaching those classes relative to the student's proposed minor and of the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies, provided they meet the minimum number of credits and course levels required of minors. AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES MINOR (18 credits) Coordinators: Tamelyn Tucker-Worgs, Hoda Zaki The African-American Studies program, an interdisciplinary minor of 18 credits, is designed to prepare students for graduate study in this and related areas.

The Graduate School promotes professional expertise in an academic environment that encourages the scholarship of teaching, discovery, application and integration of knowledge.282 GRADUATE STUDIESGraduate students most often choose Hood College because of its reputation for preparing students for professional success. The College offers graduate programs leading to the Master of Arts, Master of Fine Arts, Master of Science and Master of Business Administration degrees. Hood's graduate programs are designed for students who seek career advancement or career change. They offer excellent preparation both to students who intend to continue their studies at the doctoral or professional degree level and to students who plan to apply their new knowledge and skills in the workplace. Graduate programs at Hood College reflect the job requirements of regional employers. Hood's graduate programs benefit from the College's strong connections to regional businesses, research laboratories, high technology firms, government agencies and educational organizations. Hood faculty work with professional advisory groups to make certain that the curriculum reflects both state-of-the-art theoretical knowledge and the reality of current practice. The Hood faculty are excellent teachers and well-regarded scholars. The key to a truly outstanding education is excellent teaching. Hood's faculty are selected both for their skill as teachers and for their knowledge of and interest in the discipline they teach. Virtually all are involved in independent professional research and scholarly work, as well as projects undertaken with graduate students. In addition, many Hood graduate courses are taught by scientists, researchers, business leaders, educators and policy leaders from companies and organizations in the region. Hood's powerful mix of outstanding full-time faculty members and adjunct faculty specialists results in graduate programs of exceptional breadth and depth of instruction. Hood's graduate programs are extensions of strong and high-quality undergraduate programs. Over the past three decades, Hood has developed graduate programs in disciplines where there are particularly strong undergraduate majors. The same excellent faculty and academic resources that make Hood's undergraduate programs in these areas distinctive have formed the basis for the graduate programs. And the same experienced faculty members who have contributed to the College's national reputation as a school for undergraduates have developed, and teach in, these graduate programs. Enrollment in Hood's graduate programs is about 70 percent women and 30 percent men. A Hood College graduate degree is an excellent investment in your future. The cost to enroll in Hood's graduate programs is competitive with colleges and universities in the region. However, the value of a Hood degree is greater than simply the dollars invested; Hood's excellent reputation among employers in the region adds significantly to the currency of the Hood degree. Hood's graduate programs are designed for working adults. Hood offers strong, well- regarded academic programs, convenient scheduling and access to classes and services, and individual attention. The majority of graduate students are part-time (enrolled for 3 to 6 credits a semester), but with careful planning, full-time status is possible in most programs. Full-time status for graduate students requires registration in 9 credits of academic coursework each semester and 6 credits in the summer session. Graduate students have seven years in which to complete their degrees. Classes are scheduled during late afternoon and evening. Please contact the Graduate School for office hours for admission and registration.GRADUATE STUDIES 283GUIDE TO GRADUATE STUDIES AND ACADEMIC PROGRAMS Graduate Admission

In order to be eligible for federal loans, a student must be accepted for enrollment in a degree program, take a minimum of 3 credits each semester and be making normal progress toward a degree from Hood as described below. To apply for a federal loan, a student must complete both a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the Hood Graduate Financial Aid Application. International students, although not eligible for federal loans, may apply for loan assistance from private educational loan programs if they have a credit-worthy cosigner who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Additional information can be obtained by contacting the Office of Financial Aid. Some programs offer Graduate Assistant positions to support graduate students and needs of the department. Graduate Assistant positions will be posted with other current job openings online at www.hood.edu. Students can also inquire about this possibility with the appropriate program director. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Students are expected to maintain a record of academic achievement that will enable them to graduate in a reasonable time period. Graduate students receiving financial aid at Hood College of any type (federal, state, institutional and outside scholarships and grants) must demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively the ability to do satisfactory academic work and to progress measurably toward a degree. This is in addition to any renewal criteria required for specific state, institutional or other outside awards. Federal regulations require the Financial Aid Office to monitor students' (undergraduate and graduate) academic progress at the end of each academic year. This is to ensure that students receiving funds are successfully progressing through their program of study. At the end of the spring semester of each academic year, the Financial Aid Office evaluates the academic progress of each student receiving financial aid according to the standards set forth below by the College. This evaluation determines a student's eligibility to receive financial assistance in the next academic year. In addition, at the end of both the fall and spring semesters, the registrar reviews the qualitative academic progress of all degree-seeking students to determine the eligibility for continued enrollment at Hood College. Graduate programs range from 30 to 36 credits with most programs at the 36-credit level, and a 3.00 cumulative average is required to complete the degree. Students are considered to be making satisfactory progress toward degree completion for financial aid purposes by adhering to the schedule outlined below. SEMESTER COMPLETED CREDITS EARNED CUMULATIVE G.P.A. First/Second 12 2.75 Third/Fourth 24 3.00 Fifth/Sixth 36 3.00 Some students may not complete the degree in three calendar years, but the number of credits earned determine the year of standing. Also, these standards may not coincide exactly with the 290 GRADUATE TUITION AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTSGraduate School and the registrar's standards. The time-frame allowed for the completion of a degree can be much longer, but it is divided into academic year increments for financial aid according the schedule above. The maximum time frame in which a graduate student is expected to complete their degree is 150 percent of the published length of the program measured in academic credits. Students will become ineligible for any type of financial aid if the maximum timeframe for completion is not met. For example, if a published length of a graduate academic program is 36 credit hours; the maximum period must not exceed 54 (36 \u00d7 150%) attempted credit hours. Additional Degree / Dual Degree The maximum time frame in which a student is expected to complete their degree is 150 per - cent of the published length of the program measured in academic credits for a student pursuing an additional degree or enrolled in a dual degree program. Transfer Credits Transfer credits and/or credits for prior learning given at the time of enrollment will be counted in the total number of credits attempted. During the course of enrollment, a student may transfer credits earned at outside institutions, however, the credits will apply only for meeting the maximum timeframe standard. Treatment of W, INC, AU, F, S and U Grades and Repeated Coursework n Course withdrawals (W) after the drop/add period are not included in the G.P.A. calculation, but are considered a noncompletion of attempted coursework. n Incomplete (INC) grades are not included in the G.P.A. calculation but are considered a noncompletion of attempted coursework until the incomplete grade is replaced with a permanent grade and academic progress can be reevaluated. n An audit (AU) grade is not considered attempted coursework. It is not included in the G.P.A. calculation or completion rate determination. n A satisfactory (S) grade is treated as attempted credits earned, but it is not included in the G.P.A. calculation. n An unsatisfactory (U) grade is treated as attempted credits that are not earned, but it is not included in the G.P.A. calculation. n A failing grade (F) is treated as attempted credits not earned; it will be included in the calculation of the G.P.A. and the minimum completion rate. n All grades earned for a repeated course will be included in the calculation of the G.P.A. and every repeated attempt will be included in the completion rate determination. Financial Aid Suspension Students are placed on financial aid suspension if they do not meet one or both of the SAP standards. Students that are failing to make satisfactory academic progress and who successfully appeals will be placed on financial aid probation. Students placed in this status may continue to receive financial aid for one semester but are expected to improve their academic standing (CGPA) and/or maximum timeframe progress so that the standards of SAP are met by the end of the following semester. Financial Aid Probation If at the end of the probationary period the student still does not meet the standards set forth in this policy, eligibility to receive financial aid of any type will be suspended. Students who fail to meet the maximum timeframe towards completion of their degree within 150 percent of their attempted credits will have their financial aid canceled. Reinstatement of Aid after Probation Appeal is Approved Reinstatement of financial aid after a student is placed on probation is achieved as follows:GRADUATE RESOURCES 291n The student submits a written letter of appeal in accordance with the appeals process and the Financial Aid Appeals Committee grants the appeal. The student is placed on financial aid probation for one semester and is allowed to maintain their aid eligibility. SAP will be reviewed at the end of that semester; or n The student attends Hood College during the suspension semester, pays for tuition and fees without the help of student aid and does well enough in the coursework to satisfy all the satisfactory academic progress standards. The student must notify the Office of Financial Aid if they are planning to attend Hood College without the assistance of financial aid; or n The student may attend summer school to eliminate the deficiency in credits or G.P.A. The student must notify the Office of Financial Aid if they are planning to take classes during the summer to eliminate the deficiency. Students cannot take classes at another institution to resolve a G.P.A deficiency. Classes must be taken at Hood College. A student whose eligibility has been suspended may regain eligibility at the end of any term after which they meet the above criteria. Students who have been placed on suspension cannot skip a semester and regain eligibility. No financial aid will be disbursed during subsequent semesters for students on suspension. Appeals Process Appeals of financial aid suspension must be made in writing to the director of financial aid by the date specified in the Financial Aid Suspension notification letter. The appeal letter must address the extenuating circumstance(s) why satisfactory academic progress was not made, why the extenuating circumstance(s) has changed, as well as an outlined plan of corrective action for future academic success. The appeal must explain why the student failed to meet satisfactory academic progress and what has changed in the situ - ation that will allow him to make satisfactory progress at the next evaluation. Extenuating circumstances can include, but is not limited to, illness or injury; death of a family member; family difficulties; interpersonal problems with friends, roommate, significant others; difficulty balancing work, athletics, family responsibility; or financial difficulties. The director of financial aid will review the appeal and notify the student in writing within 10 working days whether the appeal has been accepted or denied. If the appeal has been accepted, the letter to the student will detail the academic plan of corrective action as well as require the approval of the student's academic adviser. All decisions made by the director of financial aid are final and will not be subject to further review.

Graduate students are encouraged to take advantage of these extracurricular activities. Whitaker Campus Center Please see A Hood Education, Academic Resources for information on the Whitaker Campus Center. GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES Policies and procedures for graduate studies at Hood College are intended to safeguard the integrity of the degree granted, to facilitate the student's progress toward the degree and to prevent delays and misunderstandings. The student is responsible for being thoroughly familiar with all policies and procedures as well as the requirements of the degree program. This catalog should be consulted regularly. Students who have questions about requirements or procedures should consult their adviser or the Graduate School. Academic Standards Academic Conduct The Graduate School strives to maintain and enforce the highest standards of academic integrity. Accordingly, plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty are unacceptable and will result in disciplinary action. By accepting admission to the Graduate School, a student has also accepted to be governed by the stated regulations of academic conduct, and indicates a willingness to accept disciplinary action, if behavior is deemed to be in violation of those rules or in some way unacceptable or detrimental to Hood College. During the first semester of graduate study, each student must sign a statement indicating his or her understanding of these regulations. Professed ignorance of what constitutes academic dishonesty does not excuse violations of these regulations. All Hood College graduate students are expected to comply with the following rules of academic conduct. n Examinations, Tests and Quizzes. During examinations, tests, quizzes, comprehensive examinations or other classroom work, no student shall give or receive aid in any way or form not authorized by the instructor. n Papers, Essays, Oral Presentations and Theses. Presenting oral or written work that is not the student's own (except as the instructor specifically approves) is dishonest. Any direct statement taken from other sources must be documented. Sources of information and of ideas or opinions not the student's own must be clearly indicated. Instructors may prescribe limitations on the sources to be used. n Projects and Reports. Unless otherwise directed, each student must do her or his own work, experiments, drawings and so forth, from her or his own observations. Students may work together provided that each member of the group understands the work being done, and provided that the instructor does not prohibit group work. GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 293Violations of Academic Conduct When an instructor has evidence that a graduate student is not in compliance with these expectations, it is the obligation of the instructor to bring it to the attention of the student and to evaluate the specific work as a zero. That zero is to be calculated into the final course grade. Instructors also reserve the right to assign a final course grade of \"F\" to a student for cases of academic dishonesty. Students may appeal the action of the instructor by written petition to the Graduate Council through the dean of the Graduate School. The Graduate Council will investigate the appeal and render a decision, though this decision may be appealed to the dean of the Graduate School. In perceived cases of extreme academic dishonesty, an instructor or program director may request a review by the Graduate Council. The Graduate Council will hear statements from the instructor and/or program director, and then from the student under review. If, after hearing both sides of the case, the Graduate Council finds the student to be in extreme violation of the Academic Conduct code, they will recommend dismissal from the program. The final decision will rest with the Graduate Council, though the student may appeal the decision to the dean of the Graduate School. Academic Standing and Warning A student whose cumulative grade point average (G.P.A.) is 3.0 or higher is in good academic standing, which is required for graduation. If a student's G.P.A. drops below 3.0, he or she will be placed on academic warning. The G.P.A. must be restored to 3.0 within 9 credits completed from the term in which the G.P.A. fell below 3.0. The 3.0 average may be restored by repeating courses or by taking additional courses. There are no limitations to the number of times a student can fall below 3.0 and restore his or her G.P.A. However, no more than 3 courses (9 credits) beyond those required for the degree can be used to raise the G.P.A. and all requirements for the program must be completed within the time limitation policy. Academic Dismissal A student on academic warning who does not restore the G.P.A. to 3.0 as required will be dis - missed from the College for academic reasons. A student who has been found by the Graduate Council to be in extreme violation of the Graduate School's regulations of academic conduct will be dismissed from the program and from the College (see Violations of Academic Conduct). Students who are dismissed from the College may not enroll in another graduate program or as a nondegree-seeking student. A student may appeal academic dismissal as outlined in Exceptions to Academic Policies, Regulations or Requirements . Degree Candidacy Admission to Degree Candidacy Upon successful completion of 12 graduate credits that meet departmental requirements in a degree program at Hood with a cumulative average of B (3.0) or higher, the student is formally recognized as a degree candidate. At that time, the student must complete and submit the Master's Degree Candidacy Form (DCF) for approval. Degree candidacy notification letters are mailed to the students and DCF forms are available at www.hood.edu/graduate. Students who have not submitted a degree candidacy form in accordance with the time limits specified in their degree candidacy notification letter will not be permitted to register. The form must be submitted to the Graduate School Office according to the established time limits. It is the student's responsibility to obtain signatures of the adviser and program director before the form is submitted to the Graduate School for approval by the dean. Students who have received approval for transfer credit must complete the appropriate section on the degree candidacy form. Students who take courses after completing 12 graduate credits meeting departmental requirements, and who do not complete the Master's Degree Candidacy Form, cannot be certain that such courses will meet or be accepted as degree requirements.294 GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESOnce a Master's Degree Candidacy Form has been signed it may be changed only upon written request of the student, with the approval of the adviser, program director and the dean of the Graduate School. Forms for changing the Master's Degree Candidacy Form are available in the Graduate School Office and online at www.hood.edu/graduate. An e-mail notification from the student and the adviser can be submitted to the Graduate School in lieu of the Degree Candidacy Change Form Changes in degree candidacy must be filed with the Graduate School Office prior to the semester in which the student plans to take the proposed new course. The grade point average for degree candidacy is based on all courses in the degree program, all courses in the major discipline and all other graduate courses recognized as meeting the program requirements. A student with a cumulative average below B (3.0) after completion of 12 graduate credits at Hood is not in good standing and is not classified as a candidate for a graduate degree. (See Academic Warning and Academic Dismissal). Changing from Nondegree to Degree Status A student who wishes to change from nondegree status to a degree program must inform the Graduate School Office, in writing, of this intent. The student must submit any additional documents required of the specific program of interest and have his or her file reviewed by the program director. Admission as a nondegree student does not guarantee admission to a degree program. A maximum of 12 credits taken by a nondegree student may apply to a degree program. Changing from One Degree Program to Another A student who wishes to transfer from one degree program to another must submit a written request to the Graduate School, which will consult with the appropriate department(s) before rendering any decisions. Credits earned in the original program may apply to the new program if, in the opinion of the dean, they are appropriate to the new degree. Academic performance in any and all graduate coursework will be considered in appeals to transfer between degree programs. Students who have failed to earn a degree after attempting a comprehensive examination twice\u2014or after failing to complete satisfactorily a field work project, software project or thesis\u2014may not transfer credits earned in that program to another degree program. Second Master's Degree A student who has earned one master's degree from Hood College may earn a second master's degree upon satisfactory completion of the program requirements in a second graduate degree program. Up to six hours of graduate credit may be applied from the first master's degree program to the second one. Courses eligible for transfer must have been completed no earlier than five years from the start of the Hood graduate program. The seven-year time limit will begin with enrollment in the first new course of the second graduate program. All other academic requirements will apply to the second program except that the second major or concentration must be different from the first major or concentration. Students planning to pursue a second degree must notify the Graduate School in writing of their intent. Enrollment in Two Master's Degree Programs Graduate students may enroll in and pursue two master's degree programs simultaneously. In order to apply to a second degree program, the student must submit a request in writing to the Graduate School, which will then consult with the student's current adviser and director of the second degree program. After consultation and review of the student's transcripts, a decision will be rendered. The final decision of acceptance or denial resides with the dean of the Graduate School. The following guidelines apply to students pursuing two master's degree programs simultaneously: n The student must maintain a cumulative graduate G.P.A. of 3.0 in each degree program. Dismissal from one degree program does not necessarily result in dismissal from the second degree program.GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 295n The student must successfully complete a minimum of 9 credits in his or her first degree program before requesting acceptance into a second master's degree program. n Up to six hours of graduate credit may be applied from the first master's degree program to the second one. If programs share additional course requirements, the student may be waived from completing the course in the second degree program but will have to replace the course with an appropriate course subject to the approval of the student's adviser and program director. n Degree completion will be calculated and handled separately for each degree program. All processes must be addressed separately for each program. This includes time limits, degree candidacy forms and petitions to graduate. n Pursuit of two master's degree programs will not be considered a justifiable excuse for requesting an extension of the time limit for degree completion in any one program. n The student's transcript will note both degree programs. n Academic and financial holds apply to the student and not the degree program. For example, a financial hold placed on a student's records as a result of a payment issue for a course in one degree program can prevent the student from pursuing courses in the second degree program. n A student may not pursue more than two graduate degree programs simultaneously. Degree Requirements Faculty advisers, the program director, the dean of the Graduate School and the staff are available to assist students. Procedures have been set up to check progress toward the degree. It is the student's responsibility, however, to know the requirements for her or his degree and to fulfill them. It is the student's responsibility to be thoroughly familiar with the academic policies and procedures, as outlined in this catalog. Academic Advisement Each degree-seeking student is assigned to an adviser who: 1) approves course registrations, 2) assists the student in developing a concentration, 3) presents the student's application for candidacy to the dean of the Graduate School and 4) in some instances, supervises thesis or field work if such an option is selected. Comprehensive Examinations Comprehensive examinations are built upon the content of the graduate courses taken as components of a graduate program and upon courses for which a waiver or exemption has been granted. A student may not be examined in an area where transfer credit has been awarded. While many or most of the examination questions may deal with specific subject content, some may require the student to draw together several concepts in order to demonstrate an understanding of interrelated ideas. The Notification of Intent to take the Comprehensive Examination is mailed to degree candidates in applicable degree programs in August and February and includes the upcoming fall and spring examination dates. Only students who are in good standing (maintaining a 3.0 cumulative grade point average) and whose Master's Degree Candidacy Forms are on file in the Graduate School Office may take the comprehensive examination. Specific instructions and deadlines are included in a letter from the dean. It is the students' responsibility to communicate with their advisers and to notify the Graduate School of their intent to participate by the published deadlines. The completed Petition form, signed by the adviser, should be returned to the Graduate School Office. Students should confirm receipt by the required deadline if mailing forms. The form is available online at www.hood.edu/graduate The following procedures apply to the comprehensive examination: n Notification of Intention. The student must complete the form entitled Notification of Intent to Take the Comprehensive Examination, secure the signature of the adviser and submit the form to the Graduate School, in accordance with the published deadline. No examination will be assembled unless the form is on file with the Graduate School. The form is available online at www.hood.edu/graduate. 296 GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESStudents who require special services, equipment or seating arrangements because of a disability or pregnancy, need to contact the Graduate School Office at (301) 696-3600 or via e-mail at hoodgrad@hood.edu. Accommodations will be made for persons having documented disabilities by the disability services coordinator. n The Questions. Comprehensive examination questions are written by the instructor of each course. n Assembling the Examination. In consultation with the student, the adviser, the department chair or program director prepares the comprehensive examination. Ordinarily, the test questions are drawn from one department. Occasionally, questions are drawn from several departments and appropriate department chairs are expected to assist the advisers in obtaining questions. Only one question may come from a basic human sciences course. The examination is presented to the Graduate School at least two weeks in advance of the scheduled examination. Comprehensive examination envelopes are assembled for each student. Identifying information and general instructions are on the envelope. The questions and specific directions are placed in each envelope. n Administration of the Examination. Comprehensive examinations are administered four times each year ; two days in April and two days in November. Ordinarily, the examinations are scheduled during the spring and fall semesters. The exact dates of the examinations are published in the College calendar for each year. The place of administration of the comprehensive examination will be announced. Students may choose to answer their examination questions in blue examination booklets provided or type them using Hood College desktop computers in the examination room. Personal computers are not permitted. The examination is administered and proctored by the staff of the Graduate School. The comprehensive exam is given in two parts, from 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m. The examinations begin at 9 a.m. promptly. All papers must be completed by 4 p.m. Students are expected to comply with the rules of academic conduct found under the Academic Standards section of the catalog. Students who are unable to take a comprehensive examination on the scheduled date because of hardship may petition the adviser for a substitute date. If the adviser approves the petition, the student must contact the Graduate School to make arrangements for the administration of the examination and the substitute date. In all cases, if the student wishes to complete the examination within the same semester, the substitute date must occur on a weekday no more than 10 business days after the originally scheduled examination date. The Graduate School must be informed of any alternate plans. n Grading of the Examination and Reporting the Results. The adviser or the department chair, with the assistance of the departmental instructors, arranges for grading of the examination. Where possible, the original writer of an examination question is called upon to grade that question. Questions are graded on a pass-fail basis. The adviser collects all the graded examination questions and, using departmental guidelines, grades the total examination as either pass or fail. Usually a student's total examination is graded pass when four of five questions for Human Sciences and three of four questions for Biomedical Science and Thanatology are graded pass. Frequently two or three faculty members are called upon to read and assist with the evaluation. Once the total examination is evaluated, it is the responsibility of the adviser to notify the student and the dean of the Graduate School regarding the results of the comprehensive examination. This notification must be in writing. The process of examination evaluation and notification must be completed within 30 days following the administration of the examination. Options for Students Who Have Failed the Comprehensive Examination. Only one re- examination may be arranged. Re-examination occurs during the next semester following the initial comprehensive examination, excluding summer session. The student must file another Intent to Take the Comprehensive Examination and will only be re-tested on the questions he/she failed. The student also confers with her or his adviser six weeks in advance of the re-examination. The student who has failed both the comprehensive examination and re-examination is not eligible for the master's degree, and has no further degree options.GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 297If a student fails the comprehensive examination, the only option available to that student is re-examination. The thesis, field work or project option is not available to students who fail a comprehensive examination. Field Work and Independent Research Proj ects A student must have a completed Master's Degree Candidacy Form on file in the Graduate School before the student will be permitted to register for a field work or research project. Registration must be completed during the regular registration period. Students who elect the 6-credit project option will be registered and billed for all 6 credits in one semester. Credits will not be split over the course of multiple semesters. The field work or research project is a culminating activity and therefore should follow all necessary work to assure adequate content and methodology. It is required in some degree programs and may be optional in others. Students may elect to do either a 3-credit or a 6-credit field work or research project. Students who elect to do a field work or research project must complete a Permission to Enroll form for course number 585, Master's Field Work Project, and submit a written proposal to be approved by the field work or research adviser or instructor, program director or department chair and the dean of the Graduate School. The 6-credit research project is similar to a master's thesis in structure, complexity, depth of study and rigor. The Graduate School will continue to re-register students each semester for the field work or research project as \"IP\" (In Progress) until a final grade is submitted. Students are responsible to pay the Graduate School comprehensive fee each fall and spring semester until the project is completed. The 3-credit field work or research project is a disciplined application of theories and techniques learned during the master's study and applied in a field work setting with clearly defined learning objectives. It is graded Satisfactory (S) or Unsatisfactory (U). The grade is awarded by the field work or research adviser or instructor. (The dean of the Graduate School will review the report and verify the approval of the Reading Committee.) The student is responsible for initiating either a 3- or 6-credit field work or research project proposal and for securing a field work or research adviser or instructor for the project, who will serve as the chair of the Reading Committee. The adviser and the student, in consultation, will identify two additional persons to serve on the Reading Committee. The basic procedure established for the master's thesis should be followed for the 6-credit research project. The procedure for a well-structured independent study should be followed for the 3-credit field work or research project. The final typed or printed copy of the field work or research project, with the signatures of the Reading Committee, must be delivered to the Graduate School by the student in accordance with the published calendar. The Reading Committee will have reviewed the report for correctness of format, for content, for bibliography, etc. The final report associated with the 3-credit field work or research project, while meeting the requirements of quality and rigor expected at the master's level, is not required to be as extensive in bibliography citations and structure as the 6-credit research report. The title of the report will also be noted in the student's file. The report will then be forwarded to the appropriate department chair or program director. By arrangement with the library, copies of the report from the 6-credit field work project must be bound. A comprehensive examination or thesis option is not available to students who do not satisfactorily complete a field work or research project. Master's Thesis A student must have a completed Master's Degree Candidacy Form on file in the Graduate School before the student will be permitted to register for thesis preparation. Registration must be completed during the regular registration period by submitting a signed copy of their thesis proposal to the Graduate School. Students will be registered and billed for all 6 credits in one semester. Credits will not be split over the course of multiple semesters.298 GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESA thesis is required in some degree programs and is an option in others. Before registering for course number 580, Master's Thesis Preparation, a preliminary thesis title and a written proposal must be completed. The proposal with the title page signed by the thesis adviser, program director and dean of the Graduate School must be submitted. For registration purposes, the Graduate School will complete a Permission to Enroll form to accompany the signed cover sheet. A copy of this form will be mailed to the student. The thesis preparation course is a 6-credit course and is graded Satisfactory (S) or Unsatisfactory (U). The grade is awarded by the thesis adviser. Final approval of the dean of the Graduate School is required for completion of the thesis project. A detailed statement of regulations and guidelines concerning the master's thesis is available from the Graduate School or available on our website at www.hood.edu/graduate and should be consulted before a student enrolls for Master's Thesis Preparation. A thesis is a 6-credit course; the charge for Master's Thesis Preparation is in accordance with the per credit tuition as indicated in the Graduate Tuition and Financial Arrangements section of this catalog. The Graduate School will continue to re-register students each semester for their Master's Thesis as \"IP\" (In Progress) until a final grade is submitted. Students are responsible for paying the Graduate School comprehensive fee each fall and spring semester until the project is completed. A comprehensive examination or nonthesis option is not available to students who fail a thesis defense. Humanities Capstone (HUM 595) A student must have completed a Master's Degree Candidacy Form on file in the Graduate School before he or she will be permitted to register for the Humanities Capstone course. Registration for the course must be completed during the regular registration period, by the drop/add date (see Academic Calendar) by submitting a completed and signed Permission to Enroll form and written proposal to the Graduate School. A detailed statement of regulations and guidelines concerning the Humanities Capstone is available from the Graduate School website at www.hood.edu/graduate and should be consulted before a student enrolls in the Capstone course.

The completed Application for Incomplete Grade form must be submitted to the Graduate School Office for approval by the dean of the Graduate School at the time of the agreement. Any \"INC\" must be removed by the last day of the next calendar semester unless otherwise extended by written permission of the instructor. Academic Semesters and Sessions The academic year at Hood contains a fall semester, a spring semester, a January term and two summer sessions. A calendar published in this catalog gives significant dates within the semesters and sessions. Auditing A student must register for the course to be audited. A student will not receive a grade or credit for an audited course and it will not affect the grade point average; however, the audit does appear on the transcript. New students who would like to audit a course(s) must complete the application process as a nondegree-seeking student.GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 303Only lecture courses can be audited, with permission of the instructor, and are available as space permits. There is no limit on the number of courses a student may audit during a semester. A course that was previously audited may be taken for credit at a later time. Once the course begins, students who register to audit may not change their registration status to credit; however, they may withdraw. Students who register to receive credit for a course may change to audit only during the first three weeks of the semester or the first week of the summer session. Course Cancellation The Graduate School reserves the right to cancel courses in which fewer than eight students are enrolled during the fall and spring semesters, and fewer than five students enrolled for summer terms. In the event that a course is canceled, full tuition will be reimbursed. Double-Numbered Courses Certain courses have been designated as appropriate for both graduate students and undergraduates. These \"double-numbered courses\" are identified by numbers in both the 400 and 500 range. Undergraduate students enroll in the 400-level course and receive undergraduate credit. Graduate students enroll in the 500-level course and receive graduate credit. Graduate students may have different performance standards from the undergraduates that relate to the quality and/or quantity of work required, and may also involve measures of grading at the discretion of individual faculty members. Students who took a double-numbered class at the 400 level as an undergraduate student may not take the same class at the 500 level as a graduate student for credit. Examination of Admission Folders After the applicant has enrolled at Hood College, she or he may examine the contents of her or his admission folder in the presence of a College officer at a time and date arranged with the Graduate School. This policy is in conformity with the amended Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, known as the Buckley Amendment. Exemption from Courses A student may request an exemption from taking any course offered. Exemptions are granted by the department that teaches the course for which an exemption is sought. To request an exemption, the student must present a written petition to the program director that offers courses in the field where the exemption is being sought. The petition should include the course number and title for which an exemption is being requested and the justification for the request. The action of the department regarding the request will be forwarded to the Graduate School, which will notify the student regarding the disposition of the request and make the necessary notations in the student's record. Exemption does not constitute credit toward the degree. The total number of credits required for the degree program must be completed in order for the student to qualify for the degree. Independent Study/Research Most programs offer a course entitled Independent Study and numbered 575. These courses offer students an opportunity to undertake an individual project supervised by a faculty member. To be eligible for independent study, the student must identify a faculty member who is willing to supervise the independent study project. The College cannot guarantee that all students will be able to undertake an independent study. To register for an independent study, the student must submit to the Graduate School a completed Permission to Enroll Form. The form requires a written proposal and signatures of the student, instructor, program director and dean of the Graduate School. Registration must be completed during the regular registration period. This form is available from the Graduate School Office or online at www.hood.edu/graduate304 GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESThe student and instructor must arrange a regular schedule for conferences and submission of work throughout the semester, including the date when the final paper is due. A student may register for no more than 6 credits of independent study or independent research in any degree program. A student may register for 1, 2 or 3 credits of independent study during any semester or during the summer session. Registration and Enrollment A student must be officially admitted and registered prior to attending any class session of any course. Courses and schedules of classes are announced well in advance of the beginning of each semester and summer session. Dates and hours when students may register and instructions for registering are included with the schedules. Registration dates are also posted to the College's academic calendar, which is available online at www.hood.edu/graduate. Returning students are encouraged to register online using Self-Service. New students may register by submitting the online registration form via secure e-mail submission, by mail, fax or in person. Students in the Biomedical Science, Computer Science, Humanities, Management of Information Technology and Information Technology programs must have their registration forms signed by their adviser prior to submitting them to the Graduate School. Permission may also be e-mailed to the Graduate School at hoodgrad@hood.edu Students are responsible for seeing that they have met all appropriate prerequisites before registering for courses. Failure to meet course prerequisites places the student at risk and will not be considered as cause for a refund of tuition. Students who have not met prerequisites may not be eligible to register. Students who have been admitted to the Graduate School as nondegree seeking students may be required to seek permission from the appropriate instructor or program director in order to enroll. Because some courses may be closed due to heavy student enrollment, students are encouraged to register early. Students nearing the completion of their programs should register as early as possible to avoid facing closed classes. The regular registration period continues through the end of the first day of classes. The academic calendar lists the first day of classes for each semester. Repeating Courses There are limited circumstances under which a graduate student may retake a course. A course may be repeated only once and no more than two courses can be repeated by a student within any single degree or certificate program. The grade of W does not replace a previously awarded grade. When the course is repeated, the student receives the credits for the course (counted once). While both grades will remain on the transcript for historical purposes, only the higher of the two grades will be calculated in the cumulative G.P.A. A graduate student may repeat a course if more than seven years have lapsed or the course content is considered outdated. Grades for courses taken at other institutions may not be used to replace grades for courses completed at Hood. Courses taken for undergraduate credit may not be repeated for graduate degree credit. Schedule Changes Students may drop or add courses through the Graduate School from the time of registration through the end of the drop/add period. See the Academic Calendar for dates. A student may be added to a class once the semester begins, provided the class has not met more than once and with the written permission of the instructor. During the summer sessions, the substitution or addition of courses is limited to the first two days of classes. All schedule changes must be submitted in writing. Student Course Load To be considered full time, a graduate student must pursue 9 hours of credit each fall and spring semester. In gauging the amount of time required for study in preparation for classes, the Graduate Council recommends that three or more hours of study be reserved for each hour of class. This is a general recommendation and may vary depending upon the course and individual differences in each student's background.GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 305A current graduate student may not enroll in more than 12 credits per term without written permission by the program director, academic adviser and dean. Permission may be granted after the program director, academic adviser and dean consider: the student's rationale for the request provided by the student in a brief, written statement which will be submitted to the graduate school office no later than two weeks before the start of the term in consideration; and achievement in courses completed at Hood College. The dean will be responsible for making sure the student's statement and the most recent transcript are available to the other reviewers. The student will be notified of the decision no later than 7 days before the start of the term. A student enrolling in her/his first term at Hood College may not register for more than 12 credits. Withdrawal from Classes and Refunds Notification of withdrawal must be in writing and must indicate the course number and course title. Students are encouraged to withdraw by submitting the online withdrawal form via secure e-mail submission. Students may also withdraw by sending an e-mail to hoodgrad@hood.edu, by sending a fax or letter, or by coming to the Graduate School Office in person. If faxing or mailing a withdrawal, it is the student's responsibility to call to ensure receipt. Refunds will be given if the drop/withdrawal notice is received by the Graduate School before the first course meeting or within the drop/add period as defined by the academic calendar. Refunds will not be granted for withdrawals received after the drop/add period. Withdrawal notices received before the course begins or during the drop/add period will not appear on the student's transcript. Tuition refunds are based on the full tuition charge for the course. A grade of W (indicating withdrawal) will be noted on the student's transcript for withdrawals that occur after the drop/add period. This notation carries no academic penalty. A student who does not give official notice of withdrawal will not be eligible for refunds and a grade of F (Unsatisfactory) will be recorded on the permanent record. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the Graduate School Office in writing that she or he is withdrawing. A graduate student may withdraw from a course up to the last three weeks of classes. During the last three weeks of classes, a student may not withdraw from a course. Students enrolled in a 3-credit course that meets for two weekends during the semester may withdraw from such class by submitting an official, written withdrawal notification to the Graduate School Office before the second weekend meeting date. Withdrawals for 1-credit weekend courses are not accepted once the class has met. The Office of Financial Aid is required to recalculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw. Up through 60 percent of the semester, a pro rata schedule is used to determine how much federal aid a student has earned at the time of withdrawal. The portion of unearned aid must be returned to the federal programs. When unearned aid is returned a student may owe the College additional funds. Failure to begin or ceasing to attend classes does not constitute official notice of withdrawal. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the Graduate School Office in writing of the student's desire to withdraw from a class. Withdrawal from Hood College Students who wish to withdraw from the College must submit their withdrawal notice to the Graduate School in writing. The withdrawal notice should include the reason for the withdrawal and the effective date. Students may withdraw by sending an e-mail to hoodgrad@hood.edu, by sending a fax or letter, or by coming to the Graduate School Office in person. If faxing or mailing a withdrawal, it is the student's responsibility to call to ensure receipt. Students who wish to re-enroll at the College after they have withdrawn must submit a petition for re-admission in writing to the Graduate School. Students who do not complete their program of study within their seven-year time limit will be automatically withdrawn from the College. Please refer to the section on Time Limits for information regarding time extensions.306 GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESExceptions to Academic Policies, Regulations or Requirements Exceptions to academic policies, regulations or requirements as stated in this catalog or elsewhere are rarely made. A student who believes an exception is justified may petition the Graduate Council. The petition should be addressed to the Council, in care of the dean of the Graduate School, and should state exactly what exception is being requested and the reasons for it. The degree-seeking student's faculty adviser must indicate her or his recommendation in writing; nondegree students should petition through the dean of the Graduate School. A student who is dismissed for academic reasons may petition the Graduate Council for re-admission. A student may not petition for re-admission more than twice. Petitions are to be processed according to the following procedure: n The petition must be forwarded by the petitioner to her or his academic adviser for review and written recommendation. n In cases involving a thesis, computer project or field work project, the academic adviser will forward the petition to the thesis or project adviser. n The reviewed petition will be forwarded by the adviser and/or thesis or project adviser to the program director with the recommendation. n The program director will forward the signed and reviewed petition with the recommendation(s) to the dean of the Graduate School. The student's petition should include the following information: 1) The specific exception being requested and the reason(s) for the request; 2) The expected date of graduation; 3) Any other pertinent information, such as transfer credits, thesis abstract, etc.; 4) All required signatures. Petitions are considered by the Graduate Council's Subcommittee on Student Petitions at regularly scheduled meetings. Petitions should be submitted well in advance of the scheduled meeting date. The student may appeal the outcome to the dean of the Graduate School. Grade Appeal Grade appeals of the final course grade must be filed in a timely manner. Students should contact the faculty member involved within the first week of the semester following the filing of the disputed grade. If the issue is not satisfactorily resolved, the program director must be contacted within 30 days. If still not satisfied, the student may appeal to the dean of the Graduate School. In such cases, the dean must be contacted prior to the end of the semester immediately following the semester the grade was posted. Failure to follow this timeline provides sufficient grounds for dismissing an appeal. If a student received a final grade in a course that she or he believes is incorrect or unfair, the student should first contact the faculty member involved. The grade appeal request to the faculty member must be in writing. The student must prepare a confidential written grade appeal request, outlining the specific grievances about the grading procedure, grounds for appeal and attach relevant documentation (syllabus, guidelines for papers or presentations, etc.) If, after hearing the professor's explanation, the student still wishes to appeal the grade, she or he should present the grade appeal to the program director. If talks with the faculty member and program director have not resolved the matter the student may file the appeal to the dean of the Graduate School. The last resort of appeal resides with the provost of the College. In each stage of the appeal process the student will receive a letter stating the reveiwer's recommendation within 30 days of initiation. All parties to the grade appeal (student, instructor, program director, etc.) are to maintain strict confidentiality until the matter is resolved.GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 307GRADUATE STUDENT CONDUCT AND PERFORMANCE POLICY As part of Hood's mission to prepare students for lives of responsibility and leadership, the Graduate School expects students to maintain a high standard of academic integrity and student conduct. Graduate students are adults and are expected to take personal responsibility for their own conduct. Hood College reserves the right to suspend, dismiss or otherwise discipline a student who violates the policies or regulations with respect to academic or student conduct. In addition, the Graduate School may request that a student withdraw for reasons of conduct detrimental to the College community. The Graduate School defines disruptive conduct in the following way: The disruptive student is one who continues to make unreasonable demands for time and attention from faculty and staff and habitually interferes with the learning environment by disruptive verbal or behavioral expressions, threatens or abuses members of the College community or willfully damages college property. The result is a disruption of academic, administrative, social or recreational activities on campus. Students are asked to refrain from behaviors that include, but are not limited to: n Behaviors that disrupt or interfere with teaching, research or other academic activities n Behavior that can lead to physical harm n Physical or verbal threats, intimidation that may interfere with another's full participation in the life of the College n Conduct that constitutes sexual harassment or any violation of Policy 55 n Refusing to comply with directions of school officials, instructors, administrators or staff A complaint of alleged student misconduct should be filed with the dean of the Graduate School by a member of the faculty, staff or student. All allegations should be filed in writing within 10 business days of the incident. The dean will provide a thorough investigation of the incident and take appropriate action. These sanctions may include: n Warning: written notice to the student that continued and/or repeated incidents/ violations may be cause for further disciplinary action (reprimand, dismissal). A permanent record of the incident report will be retained in the student's file. Additionally, the warning may include referrals to appropriate office for assistance. n Reprimand: written reprimand for the violation of specified conduct or policy including notice to the student that repeated violation may result in further disciplinary action n Dismissal: termination of student status at the College Appeal Process Within 10 business days of receiving notification from the dean concerning the decision concerning the formal complaint, the student may request a written request to the Graduate Council Subcommittee for reconsideration. This reconsideration must be based on procedural errors or new information not available at the time the complaint was lodged with the dean. The matter of academic or student conduct resides with the Graduate Council. The Graduate Council Subcommittee will then appoint a three-person committee comprised of members selected from the Graduate Council. This committee will then hear the case. The hearing committee will review the sanction and proceedings and report its findings to the student and dean. The student can appeal the outcome to the provost308 M.S.

Graduate Program Overview Candidates completing the graduate and post-baccalaureate programs will gain the requisite knowledge, skills and dispositions to meet national, professional, state and institutional EDUCATION 317standards. In compliance with NCATE guidelines for national accreditation, the department is guided by a conceptual framework that includes the following vision and mission statements and institutional outcomes. Our Vision as a Department The Education Department believes that well-educated and prepared teachers and educational leaders have a sense of self-satisfaction in both intellectual pursuits and pedagogical applications. The department believes that the discipline of education is a scholarly pursuit, a science, an art and a profession. We believe that the Education Department must provide candidates with a theoretical knowledge base, technological tools and support to become competent professionals of the art of education and guidance to operate within an ethical profession in a diverse society. Mission Statement Our mission as an education department is to prepare academically competent and professional educators who are committed to facilitating learning in a culturally diverse society. This mission reflects a commitment to providing a technologically enhanced environment in which to nurture highly skilled educators who have a broad base in the liberal arts, are active learners and are reflective practitioners. In order to meet our vision and mission statements, the Education Department has framed six Institutional Outcomes (IOs) that all candidates must meet. These IOs are assessed at various points in the programs of study. Institutional Department Outcomes We believe that the education department at Hood College prepares educators who: n Demonstrate the subject matter content, pedagogical knowledge, teaching skills and professional dispositions necessary to ensure that all of their students and clients learn. (CONTENT KNOWLEDGE and SKILLS) n Use their knowledge of diversity to create learning environments that support the belief that all students can learn. (DIVERSITY) n Have attained the necessary skills to use assessment data to guide practices that support the belief that all students can learn. (ASSESSMENT) n Have attained the necessary skills to use technology to enhance learning. (TECHNOLOGY) n Communicate effectively with students, parents and colleagues in order to facilitate learning. (COMMUNICATION) n Reflect on their practice and are committed to continued professional growth. (REFLECTIVE PRACTICE) For admission information, see Graduate Admission and Program Specific Application Requirements. All the graduate programs in education leading to a master's degree consist of three phases and candidates must meet program requirements at each phase before advancing to the next phase of the program. Phase I - Advancement to Full Candidacy n Complete 12 credits of coursework as specified in each program of study with a cumulative 3.0 grade point average. n Complete performance assessments in required Phase I courses at the proficient or advanced level. n Submit completed Degree Candidacy Form signed by academic adviser, program director and dean of the Graduate School.318 EDUCATIONPhase II - Midpoint Transition (Preparation for Intensive Collaborative Practice) n Complete required Phase II courses with an overall 3.0 grade point average. n Complete performance assessments in required Phase II courses at the proficient or advanced level. n Complete program specific requirements to judge readiness for Intensive Collaborative Practice in Phase III.

Program Completion n Complete appropriate program specific requirements for each program of study for program completion. n Complete program surveys and activities at the beginning and at the completion of the program that provide data for program improvement. Students who enroll in either EDUC 597 (Action Research/Research Project) for Curriculum and Instruction or EDUC 587 or EDUC 588 (Administrative Internship) for Educational Leadership will initially enroll in the course for the fall semester. The Graduate School will re-register students for the course in the spring as \"IP\" (In Progress) until a final grade is submitted. Students will pay the Graduate School comprehensive fee each fall and spring semester until the course is completed. Candidates enrolling in an Education graduate program are assessed on the six Institutional Outcomes (IOs) and their core (dispositional) beliefs (commitment to continuous content knowledge and skills development; all students can learn: consistent and purposeful assessment guides practice and instruction; effective and ethical use of technology will enhance learning; effective communication with all stakeholders will facilitate learning; and reflective practice to inform and promote professional growth) as part of program expectations. The Education Department assesses these professional dispositions through candidate pre- and post-surveys, through course expectations and collaborative practice experiences and can issue a dispositional alert if candidates fail to meet these professional dispositions. Faculty members and/or the program director may fill out a dispositional alert form with a remediation action plan to notify the candidate of such concerns. Failure to complete the action plan may lead to program dismissal. All Education graduate programs require all candidates who enroll as program completers or nonprogram completers to use the Chalk and Wire e-Portfolio system to create a program portfolio with specified performance assessments and activities. Candidates must enroll in EDUC 502 as their first course and receive training on creating their program portfolio.
