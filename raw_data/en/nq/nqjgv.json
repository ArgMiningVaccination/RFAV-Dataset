EXECUTIVE SUMMARY BACKGROUND The Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) for the communities served by Raritan Bay Medical Center (RBMC) is designed to ensure that the Medical Center continues to effectively and efficiently serve the health needs of the area. RBMC , a member of Hackensack -Meridian Health (HMH) , operates two acute care locations , Perth Amboy and Old Bridge, NJ . Each division has its own Primary Service Area (PSA) as well as overlapping portions served by both hospitals. The CHNA is developed in accordance with all federal rules and statutes, specifically, PL 111 -148 (the Affordable Care Act) which added Section 501(r) to the Internal Revenue Code. A Community Benefit Task Force was convened to oversee development of the CHNA . The Committee is comprised of key county stakeholders (government, civic, community -based organizations, faith -based organizations and health care providers) focused on improving the health of community residents. The findings and recommendations of the Task Force informed the CHNA process and u ltimately the selection of community health need priority areas based on capacity, resources, competencies, and needs specific to the population serve d. The CHNA uses detailed secondary public health data at the County and community levels to identify hea lth assets, gaps, disparities and trends. The data include s hospital - and c ommunity -specific billing data and local public health data. The communities considered throughout this CHNA are pictured here , and are all within Middlesex County. According t o population estimates, Middlesex County is the second most populous county in New Jersey. Between 2010 and 2017, Middlesex County's population increase s by 4.8%. Much of the growth occurs in Monroe, which experience s a 14.8% population increase, Perth A mboy 5.2 %; and Old Bridge 4.8%; all municipalities within RBMC's Combined Service Areas. Middlesex County's municipalities are diverse, encompassing small towns, urban centers and rural communities. The RBMC Service A rea contains pockets of mid-sized urban centers includ ing poor and minority populations. The following exemplifies a few social and economic differences identified: According to 2017 population estimates, Monroe (33.7%) has more than two times the number of residents aged 65+ as compared to Middlesex County (14.2%). According to 2017 population estimates, 42.2% of Middlesex County, 67.5% of Monroe and 10.7% of Perth Amboy residents are White as compared to 54.9% statewide. RBMC Service Area HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (ii) New Solutions, Inc. o In 2017, 20.4% of New Jersey residents are Hispanic, approximate ly one -quarter of the percentage of Perth Amboy (79.6%) residents. o The Hispanic population in Middlesex County increase s 18.6% from 2010 through 2017. o In 2017, 24.6% of Middlesex County residents are Asian, nearly 2 \u00bd times New Jersey (9.6%). o The Asian population in Middlesex County increase s 20.6% between 2010 and 2017. Middlesex County 2017 median household income ($86,445) exceed s the New Jersey median household income ($75,854) by $10,591 or 14%. o Perth Amboy 's 2017 median household income is $38,740 (44.9%) less than Middlesex County and $28,149 (37.1%) less than New Jersey. According to the US Census, in 2015, Middlesex County (9.0%) has fewer individuals living below the Federal Poverty Level than New Jersey (10.8%). o Perth Amboy and Carteret have among the highest poverty rates and exceed those of the State. o The 2015 ACS Survey reports 19.8% of Perth Amboy families and 11.1% of Carteret families are living below the FPL compared to 6.5% in Middlesex County and 8.2% statewide. Between 2010 and 2014, New Jersey, Middlesex County, Old Bridge and Woodbridge experience at least a 25% reduction in unemployment while Perth Amboy demonstrate s a 16% decline in the same time frame. o In 2014, the Perth Amboy unemployment rate (1 3.2%) is double that of Middlesex County (6.6%). New Jersey, Middlesex County, RBMC -PA and RBMC -OB Service Area residents have a higher percentage of individuals who did not complete a high school education than the Healthy People 2020 target of 2.1%. o The percent of Middlesex County residents (11.2%) without a high school diploma in 2017 is five times greater than the Healthy People 2020 target (2.1%). o In 2017, Perth Amboy (27.3%) has two and a half times the percent of residents with less than a high scho ol education than Middlesex County (11.2%). o Perth Amboy (10.4%) has less than half the amount of resident college graduates compared to statewide (22.8%). In 2015, according to the U.S. Census, 26.8% more Middlesex County residents over age 5 (16.8%) report speaking English as \"less that very well\" than across New Jersey (12.3%). In addition to social and demographic differences, d isparities in Middlesex County and RBMC's Primary Service Area (PSA) residents' incidence and prevalence of illness identi fied by this CHNA include: Between 2010 and 2014, six of the top 10 leading causes of death for Middlesex County improve including: heart disease AAMR for CLRD and diabetes demonstrate greatest improvement. Between 2010 and 2014, the Middlesex County age -adjusted mor tality rates (AAMR) increases for unintentional injuries (5.3%), kidney disease (15.2%), and drug induced deaths (75.9%). o In 2014, drug ind uced deaths enter the Top 10 leading causes of death for the first time. Across all race s/ethnicities, the Middlesex County death rate for heart disease improve s from 2010 through 2014. HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (iii) New Solutions, Inc. o In 2014, the Middlesex County heart disease mortality rate for Whites (176.2/100,000) is similar to New Jersey (173.4/100,000). o Within the County, Whites have the highest heart disease mortality rate as compared to statewide statistics in which Blacks (1 91.2/100,000) have the highest rate. o The statewide rate for Blacks exceeds that of Middlesex County Whites by 19.9%. Middlesex County's overall invasive cancer incidence is nearly three times greater than Healthy People 2020 target of 161.4 /100,000 . Between 2010 and 2013, incidence trends by site for Middlesex County are : o Melanoma - 21.0% increase o Colon/Rectum - .7% increase o Lung - 1.0% increase o Breast - 10.9% increase By race/ethnicity , 2012 -2014, Black non -Hispanics have the highest death rate due t o stroke in New Jersey (45.6/100,000), Middlesex County (37.7/100,000) and surrounding counties. o The 2014 Middlesex County death rate for strokes for Blacks (37.7/100,000) is 37.5% greater than the rate for Whites (29.6/100,000). Diabetes is increasing among Middlesex County residents. o Between 2012 (8.4%) and 2015 (9.9%), an additional 1.5 percentage point increase of County residents report having the disease. The Middlesex County 2010 -2014 Black infant mortality rate of 7.4/100,000 is 60 .9% greater than the State rate of 4.6/100,000. o The Middlesex County 2015 percent of Black low birth weight babies is 25% higher than Whites. o The Middlesex County 2015 percent of Black (2.4%) very low birth weight babies is double Whites (1.2%). Middlesex County women enrolled in first trimester prenatal care decline s 9.0% between 2011 (86.2%) and 2015 (78.4%). The percent of Middlesex County women without prenatal care trend s upward from .7% in 2011 to 1.3% in 2015. 2015 Birth rate to teens age 15 -19 in Perth Amboy (36.4/1,000) is four times the Middlesex County rate (9.4/1,000). Healthy Community Health Indicators identify that: In 2015, nearly four percent of New Jersey and Middlesex County low income residents do not live close to a grocery store. o In 2015, Middlesex County (3.7%) exceeds the CHR national benchmark (1%) for low income residents residing far from a grocery store; Middlesex County performs lower than the CHR benchmark by more than 25%. In 2015, 54% of Middlesex County restaurants are fast food compared to 50% of statewide, ranking the county in the middle quartile among all New Jersey counties. o In 2015, Middlesex County (54%) has 50% more fast food establishments than the CHR national benchmark (27%). Between 2012 and 2015, BRFSS data report s a small increase in the percent of Middlesex County residents who indicate their health as \"poor or fair,\" from 13.0% to 13.5%. o Compared to the County Health Ranking benchmark, more ( greater than 25% more) Middlesex County residents report \"fair o r poor\" health than the 10.0% benchmark. HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (iv) New Solutions, Inc. NJBRFSS report s that the number of Middlesex County adults with 14 or more physically unhealthy days (in the last 30 days) increase s over 4 percentage points between 2012 (7.2%) and 2015 (11.4%) as the State remain s relatively constant at 9.7%. County -wide adults who report 14 or more of the past 30 days with \"not good\" mental health status increase s 2.7 percentage points from 8.1% in 2012 to 10.8% in 2015. The violent crime rate in Middlesex County decrease s 21.6% from 2006 -2008 (203/100,000) to 2012 -2014 (159/100,000). o Compared to all 21 counties statewide, Middlesex County's violent crime rate ranks in the best performing quartile. The Middlesex County burglary rate decrease s 24.5% from 339.7/100,000 in 2013 to 256.2/100,000 in 2015. TOP HEALTH ISSUES Top h ealth issues emerged as those most likely to benefit residents of the areas served by the Medical Center and to be within its purview, competency and resources of RBMC to impact in a meaningful manner . Although these issues are highest priorities, other issues are intertwined and therefore gain peripheral attention. 1) Diabetes 2) Heart Disease / Cardiovascular Disease 3) Physical Activity / Obesity 4) Mental Health / Substance Abuse 5) Access Note: HMH -RBMC recognizes that Access is integral in addressing the community health needs encompassed by the first four priority areas and is therefore addressed in the activities portion of the Community Health Implementation Plan (CHIP). Each of the top health issues impacting RBMC's community is detailed below. Included information represents national perspectives and background on the issue, populations impacted within a community, methods that may be used to address an issue, and/or em erging national trends. County and Service area specific data are included to provide a reference point as to how RBMC's communities are more/less uniquely impacted by an issue. Summarized background information is from multiple sources, including the Ce nters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) Healthy People 2020, National Institutes of Health, and additional source material, as referenced . After presenting an analysis of service gaps and assets across health indicators and survey results, the following priority issues were identified: 1. Diabetes Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases where the body's pancreas does not produce enough insulin or does not properly respond to insulin produced, resulting in high blood sugar levels over a prolonged HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (v) New Solutions, Inc. period. There are several different types of diabete s, but the most common forms are type 1 and type 2 diabetes . Both impact glucose levels, and if left untreated, can cause many complications.1 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) can occur at any age, but is most commonly diagnosed from infancy to late 30s. If a person is diagnosed with T1D, their pancreas produces little to no insulin, and the body's immune system destroys the insulin -producing cells in the pancreas. Those diagnosed with T1D must inject insulin several times every day or continually infuse insulin through a pump, as well as manage their diet and exercise habits. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) typically develops after age 40, but has recently begun to appear with more frequency in children. If a person is diagnosed with T2D , their pancreas still produces insulin, but the body does not produce enough or is not able to use it effectively. Those diagnosed with T2D manage their disease through a combination of treatments, including diet control, exercise, self - monitoring of bloo d glucose, and in some cases, oral drugs or insulin. Normally, blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin lowers the blood glucose level. When blood glucose elevates (e.g. after eating) insulin is released from the pancreas to normalize the glucose level. In diabetic patients, the absence or insufficient production of insulin causes hyperglycemia. Diabetes is a chronic life -long condition which can be controlled. More than 30 million people ar e living with Diabetes in the U.S. Approximately 7.2 million of U.S. residents living with Diabetes are undiagnosed. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the US and is the No. 1 cause of kidney failure, lower -limb amputations, and adult -onset blindness. In the last 20 years , the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes has more than tripled as the American population has aged and become more overweight or obese.2 Total medical costs and lost work/wages for people diagnosed with diabetes are $245 billion and medical costs for people with diabetes is more than double the cost of people without diabetes . The risk of death for adults with diabetes is 50% higher than adults without diabetes and people who have diabetes have higher risk of serious health complications, including blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, stroke and loss of toes, feet and/or legs. Diabetics may suffer from nerve damage because of damage to small vessels. Diabetes is also a factor in accelerating the hardening and na rrowing of blood arteries (atherosclerosis). Prevention or delaying the onset of T2D includes losing weight (if necessary), eating a healthy and nutritious diet, and becoming more active. Managing diabetes requires the involvement of health professionals, a healthy diet and increases activity. Better treatment has enabled people with diabetes to live longer than before and with a better quality of life. Prediabetes is a serious health condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough yet to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes . Approximately 84 million American adults \u2014more than 1 out of 3 \u2014have prediabetes. Of those with prediabetes , 90% don't know they have it. Prediabetes puts you at an increase d risk of developing type 2 diabetes , heart disease, and stroke. 1 Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) ; www.jdrf.org 2 Centers for -diabetes -statistics -report.pdf HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (vi) New Solutions, Inc. There are numerous alarming statistics regarding diabetes and Latino populations in the U.S.3, which may require a targeted approach by providers to diagnose, educate and treat Latino populations in the communities served by RBMC. There is a higher prevalence of diabetes among the United States' Latino population, approximately 17% have diabetes versus 8% among Whites. Approx imately 1 in 6 adult Latinos have diabetes and only 59% are aware of their condition. Uncontrolled diabetes shortens Latinos' life -span by 10 to 15 years. A Latino child born today has a 50% chance of developing diabetes in his or her lifetime. Approximately one quarter of Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans over the age of 45 have diabetes . With respect to diabetes among Middlesex County residents: Diabetes is the 8th leading cause of death in 2009; in 2014 diabetes is the 6th leading cause of death. Despite variability from 2006 to 2015, Middlesex County individuals with diabetes trend s upward from 7.9% in 2006 to 9.9% in 2015, increasing 26.9% between 2011 and 2015. Since 2007, in comparison to the State and National statistics, prevalence of diabetes is variable. In 2015, Middlesex is the poorest performing county compared to the nation, New Jersey and surrounding counties. Diabetes prevalence in Middlesex County ra nks in the worst performing quartile State wide . Among hospitalize d patients, residents of RBMC -PA's Service Area have the highest incidence of diabetes , 60.04/1,000 population in 2015 compared to 50.31 /1,000 among RBMC -OB residents. Perth Amboy City has a rate/1,000 population in 2015 of 90.24, nearly double the Middlesex County figure of 48.49/1,000. Old Bridge Township ha s a rate/1,000 population in 2015 of 53.85 .4 In RBMC's 2014 Community Health Needs Assessment, obesity and healthy nutrition are the top ranked health problem by respondents to the Community Health Survey. Effectively addressing obesity and healthy nutrition in the community will have a direct effect on the impact of diabetes on area residents. In 2017, Physical Activity / Obesit y rank s 4th in terms of prioritized health issues affecting the community. As RBMC moves forward with implementation planning to address diabetes within the communities it serves, the continued coordinated approach to addressing healthy nutrition, obesity and physical activity will create a positive impact on efforts to identify, treat and educate patients with diabetes . 2. Heart Disease / Cardiov ascular Disease Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. Together, heart disease and stroke, along with other cardiovascular disease, are among the most widespread and costly health problems facing the Nation today, accounting for 3 Joslin Diabetes Center: Latino Diabetes Initiative 4 Source: NJ UB -04 Acute Care IP, Same Day Stay, ER Discharges (2012 - 2015), Population: 2010, 2016 Nielsen -Claritas/HCDA, 2011 Straight Line Value Based on 2000 and 2010 Census; Definition: Inpatient, Same Day Stay and ED Discharges - ICD-9 DX Codes in The Range 249.00 -250.03 (Appearing Anywhere in First 13 DX Codes on Patient Record) HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (vii) New Solutions, Inc. approximately $320 billion in health care expenditures and related expenses annually. Fortunately, they are also among the most preventable.56 The leading modifiable (controllable) risk factors for heart disease and stroke are: High blood pressure High cholesterol Cigarette smoking Diabetes Unhealthy diet and physical inactivity Overweight and obesity Over time, these risk factors cause changes in the heart and blood vessels that can lead to heart attacks, heart failure, and strokes. It is critical to address risk factors early in life to prevent these devastating events and other potential complications of chronic cardiovascular disease. Controlling risk factors for heart disease and stroke remains a challenge. High blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and high blood cholesterol are still major contributors to the national epidemic of cardiovascular disease. High blood pressure affects approximately 1 in 3 adults in the United States, and only about half of them have it under control. High sodium intake can increase blood pressure and the risk for heart disease and stroke, yet about 90% of American adults exceed their daily recommendation for sodium intake. The risk of Americans developing and dying from cardiovascular disease would be substantially redu ced if major improvements are made across the U.S. population in diet and physical activity, control of high blood pressure and cholesterol, smoking cessation, and appropriate aspirin use. Currently more than 1 in 3 adults (85.6 million) live with 1 or mo re types of cardiovascular disease. In addition to being the first and fifth leading causes of death, heart disease and stroke result in serious illness and disability, decreased quality of life, and hundreds of billions of dollars in economic loss every year. The burden of cardiovascular disease is disproportionately distributed across the population. There are significant disparities in the following based on gender, age, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and socioeconomic status: Preval ence of risk factors Access to treatment Appropriate and timely treatment Treatment outcomes Mortality Disease does not occur in isolation, and cardiovascular disease is no exception. cardiovascular health is significantly influenced by the physical, social, and political environment, including: Maternal and child health Access to educational opportunities Availability of healthy foods, physical education, and extracurricular activities in schools 5 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_heart_disease.htm 6 Healthy People 2020; https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/top ics-objectives/topic/Access -to-Health -Services Opportunities for physi cal activity, including access to safe and walkable communities Access to healthy foods HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (viii) New Solutions, Inc. Quality of working conditions and worksite health Availability of community support and resources Access to affordable, quality health care With respect to heart and cardiovascular disease (s) among Middlesex County residents: Despite an 11% decline between 2010 (174.4/100,000) and 2014 (155.2/100,000) and a top 25% statewide ranking , deaths due to heart disease perform lower than the Healthy People 2020 target (108.8/100,000) by 42.6%. The 2014 Middlesex County mortality rate due to heart disease (155.2/100,000) is 6.2% lower than Statewide (165.4/100,000) and is similar to neighboring Union and Monmouth Counties. Across all race/ethn icities, the Middlesex County death rate for heart disease improves from 2010 through 2014. o In 2014, the Middlesex County heart disease mortality rate for Whites (176.2/100,000) is similar to New Jersey (173.4/100,000). Within the County, Whites have the highest heart disease mortality rate as compared to statewide statistics in which Blacks (191.2/100,000) have the highest rate. The statewide rate for Blacks exceeds that of Middlesex County Whites by 19.9%. The Middlesex County stroke AAMR decrease s 9.9% from 2010 (29.4/100,000) to 2014 (26.5/100,000). In 2014, the County AAMR is 21.6% lower than the Healthy People 2020 target (33.8/100,000). The 2014 Middlesex County stroke AAMR (26.5/100,000) is 15.1% lower than the State (31.2/100,000) and is in the top performing quartile statewide , better than neighboring Union and Monmouth Counties. By race/ethnicity , 2012 -2014, Black non -Hispanics have the highest death rate due to stroke in New Jersey (45.6/100,000), Middlesex County (37.7/100,000) and surrou nding counties. o The 2014 Middlesex County death rate for strokes for Blacks (37.7/100,000) is 37.5% greater than the rate for Whites (29.6/100,000). According to BRFSS, the percent of Middlesex County residents told they ha ve angina or coronary heart disease remain s relatively stable from 3.5% in 2012 to 3.6% in 2015. In 2015, BRFSS indicate s 3.9% of New Jersey respondents ha ve angina or coronary heart disease, 9.1% greater than Middlesex County. As compared to New Jersey, Middlesex County residents with angina or coronary heart disease perform in the middle quartile. According to BRFSS, the percent of Middlesex County residents told they have had a heart attack increase s 1.4 percentage points from 3.4% in 2012 to 4.8% in 20 15. In 2015, BRFSS indicate s 3.4% of New Jersey respondents are told they have had a heart attack, 41.1% greater than Statewide. Middlesex County ranks in the lowest performing quartile compared to all 21 New Jersey counties for residents told they have had a heart attack. BRFSS reports a constant 1.7% of Middlesex County residents reporting a stro ke between 2012 and 2015 . In 2015, Middlesex County (1.7%) report s fewer strokes than the State (2.0%) and the Country (2.9%). Middlesex County ranks among the middle quartile compared to all 21 New Jersey counties for percentage of population that have had a stroke. In 2015, 29.2% of Middlesex County adults are aware that they suffer from hypertension, one percentage point higher than New Jersey adults (28.2%). HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (ix) New Solutions, Inc. Between 2009 and 2015, Middlesex County adults who are told they have high blood pressure increase s from 27.5% to 29.2% In 2015, Middlesex County (29.2%) exceed s the Healthy People 2020 target (26.9%) for adults with high blood pressure. In 2015, 31.3% of Middlesex County adults who have their cholesterol checked are aware that the results are high, slightly lower than New Jersey adults (31.6%). The percent of Middlesex County adults reporting high cholesterol to BRFSS trend s downward from 2009 through 201 5, decreasing 10.4% between 2011 and 2015. With respect to heart and cardiovascular disease(s) among Service Area residents7: The rate of Middlesex County residents hospitalized with a heart attack (2012 -2015) are lower than those in the hospital Service Areas ( Combined, RBMC -PA, RBMC -OB) and the ZIP Codes of Perth Amboy and Old Bridge. In 2015, Perth Amboy residents exhibit the highest rate for patients hospitalized with heart attacks at 1.79/1,000 and Old Bridge residents report the lowest rate of 1.26/ 1,000. Between 2012 and 2015, the rate of patients hospitalized with h eart failure in Middlesex County is lower than the hospital Service Areas, Perth Amboy and Old Bridge ZIP Codes. In 2015, Old Bridge residents exhibit the highest rate for patient's hospitalized with heart failure/CHF at 4.16/1,000 and Middlesex County residents report the lowest rate of 2.92/1,000. From 2012 through 2015, more Perth Amboy patients are hospitalized with stroke/TIA compared to the RBMC Service Areas, Old Brid ge and Middlesex County. In 2015, Perth Amboy (3.18/1,000) has the highest rates for patients hospitalized with stroke/TIA in the region and Old Bridge (2.42/1,000) has the lowest. Perth Amboy has the highest rate of patients hospitalized with hypertension for each year 2012 through 2015. In 2015, Perth Amboy (172.21/1,000) ha s the highest rates for patients hospitalized with hypertension in the region and Middlesex County (105.52/1,000) ha s the lo west. The rate for patients hospitalized with high cholesterol discharges/1,000 population is highest in Perth Amboy for each year 2012 through 2015. In 2015, the rate of patients in the hospital with high cholesterol (discharges/1,000 population ) is highe st in Perth Amboy (37.55/1,000) and lowest in Middlesex County (19.33/1,000). 3. Physical Activity / Obesity Obesity, defined as a body mass index (BM) >=30, is common, serious, and costly. In 2009, about 2.4 million more adults are obese than in 2007. This epidemic has affected every part of the United States. In every state, more than 15% of adults are obese, and in nine states, over 30% of adults are obese. The medical care costs of obesity in the United States are staggering. Rec ent estimates of the annual medical costs are as high as $147 billion. More efforts are needed, and new federal initiatives are helping to change our communities into places that strongly support healthy eating and active living.8 Non -Hispanic black wome n and Hispanics have the highest rates of obesity (41.9% and 30.7%). 7 Source: NJ UB -04 Acute Care IP, Same Day Stay, ER Discharges (2012 - 2015), Population: 2010, 2016 Nielsen -Claritas/HCDA, 2011 Straight Line Value Based on 2000 and 2010 Census; Definition: Inpatient, Same D ay Stay and ED Discharges for Select Diseases 8 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/pdf/2010 -08-vitalsigns.pdf HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (x) New Solutions, Inc. Obesity is a contributing cause of many other health problems, including heart disease, stroke, Diabetes , and some types of Cancer . These are some of the leading causes of death in the U. S. Obesity can cause sleep apnea and breathing problems and make activity more difficult. Obesity can also cause problems during pregnancy or make it more difficult for a woman to become pregnant. Obese persons require costlier medical care. This places a huge financial burden on our medical care system. The Nutrition and Weight Status objectives for Healthy People 2020 reflect strong science supporting the health benefits of eating a healthful diet and maintaining a healthy body weight. The objectives als o emphasize that efforts to change diet and weight should address individual behaviors, as well as the policies and environments that support these behaviors in settings such as schools, worksites, health care organizations, and communities. The goal of p romoting healthful diets and healthy weight encompasses increasing household food security and eliminating hunger. Americans with a healthful diet9: Consume a variety of nutrient -dense foods within and across the food groups, especially whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low -fat or fat -free milk or milk products, and lean meats and other protein sources. Limit the intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, added sugars, sodium (salt), and alcohol. Limit caloric intake to meet caloric needs In con junction with addressing diet to reduce obesity in a population, Healthy People 2020 has released Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (PAG), the first -ever publication of national guidelines for physical activity. The Physical Activity objectives fo r Healthy People 2020 reflect the strong state of the science supporting the health benefits of regular physical activity among youth and adults, as identified in the PAG. Regular physical activity includes participation in moderate - and vigorous -intensity physical activities and muscle -strengthening activities. More than 80% of adults do not meet the guidelines for both aerobic and muscle -strengthening activities. Similarly, more than 80% of adolescents do not do enough aerobic physical activity to meet t he guidelines for youth. Working together to meet Healthy People 2020 targets via a multidisciplinary approach is critical to increasing the levels of physical activity and improving health in the United States10. The Physical Activity objectives for Healt hy People 2020 highlight how physical activity levels are positively affected by: Structural environments, such as the availability of sidewalks, bike lanes, trails, and parks Legislative policies that improve access to facilities that support physical ac tivity Physical activity in childcare settings Behavioral interventions to reduce television viewing and computer usage Recess and physical education in the Nation's public and private elementary schools Regular physical activity can improve the health and quality of life of Americans of all ages, regardless of the presence of a chronic disease or disability. Among adults and older adults, physical activity can lower the risk of: 9 Healthy People 2020; https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (xi) New Solutions, Inc. Early death Coronary heart disease Stroke High blood pre ssure Type 2 Diabetes Breast and colon Cancer Falls Depression Among children and adolescents, physical activity can: Improve bone health Improve cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness Decrease levels of body fat Reduc e symptoms of depression Improve cognitive skills Improve ability to concentrate and pay attention Personal, social, economic, and environmental factors all play a role in physical activity levels among youth, adults, and older adults. Understanding the barriers to and facilitators of physical activity is important to ensure the effectiveness of interventions and other actions to increase levels of physical activity. Factors positively associated with adult physical activity include: Postsecondary education Higher income Enjoyment of exercise Expectation of benefits Belief in ability to exercise (self -efficacy) History of activity in adulthood Social support from peers, family, or spouse Access to and satisfaction wit h facilities Enjoyable scenery Safe neighborhoods Factors negatively associated with adult physical activity include: Advancing age Low income Lack of time Low motivation Rural residency Perception of great effort needed for exercise Overweight or obesity Perception of poor health Being disabled Environmental influences positively associated with physical activity among children and adolescents include: Presence of sidewalks Having a destination /walking to a specific place Access to public transportation Low traffic density Access to neighborhood or school play area and/or recreational equipment People with disabilities may be less likely to participate in physical activity due to physical, emotional, and psychological barriers. Barriers may include the inaccessibility of facilities and the lack of staff trained in working with people with disabilities. HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (xii) New Solutions, Inc. Healthy People 2020 reflects a multidisciplinary approach to promoting physical activity. This approach brings about traditional partnerships, such as that of education and health care, with nontraditional partnerships representing transportation, urban pl anning, recreation, environmental health, and other fields. With respect to physical activity / obesity issues among Middlesex County and Service Area residents: County -wide individuals with a BMI>=30 trend s upward from 2006 through 2013, increasing 8.7% from 2010 to 2013. From 2007 through 2013, the percent of Middlesex County residents who are obese is lower than Statewide. The 2013 percent of Middlesex County residents with a BMI>=30 is below the Healthy People 2020 target of 30.6% and the County Health Rankings benchmark of 25%. County -wide residents age 20+ reporting no leisure -time physical activity trend s downward from 2010 through 2013, decreasing 10%. From 2008 through 2013, the percent of Middlesex County residents with no leisure time physical activity is marginally higher than Statewide. The 2013 percent of Middlesex County residents age 20+ reporting no leisure -time physical activity is above the County Health Rankings benchmark of 21%. The perc ent of all restaurants that are fast food establishments in Middlesex County in 2010 is 55%, 5 percentage points higher than the State and in the least favorable quartile based on County Health Rankings. In the Combined Service Area, the rate of obesity among hospitalized patients increase s from 12.13 in 2012 to 13.56 in 2015 . Rates are higher in Old Bridge (15.66) and Perth Amboy (16.27) than County -wide (11.22)11. 4. Mental Health / Substance Abuse Mental health and substance abuse, most often addressed jointly as \"behavioral health\", represent a broad array of disorders, many of which are co -occurring, and an equally wide -ranging number of treatment pathways. For purposes of explanation here, the t wo areas are separated to ensure that the CHNA identifies distinct elements of each. Ultimately, addressing both areas will include significant overlap. Mental Health As described by Healthy People 2020, mental health is a state of successful performance of mental function, resulting in productive activities, fulfilling relationships with other people, and the ability to adapt to change and to cope with challenges. Mental health is essential to personal well -being, fam ily and interpersonal relationships, and the ability to contribute to community or society. Mental disorders are health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, and/or behavior that are associated with distress and/or impaired f unctioning. Mental disorders contribute to a host of problems 11 Source: NJ UB -04 Acute Care IP, Same Day Stay, ER Discharges (2012 - 2015), Population: 2010, 2016 Nielsen -Claritas/HCDA, 2011 Straight Line Value Based on 2000 and 2010 Census; Definition: Inpatient, Same Day Stay and ED Discharges - ICD-9 DX Codes 278.00 or 278.01 (Appearing Anywhere in First 13 DX Codes on Patient Record) HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (xiii) New Solutions, Inc. that may include disability, pain, or death. Mental illness is the term that refers collectively to all diagnosable mental disorders.12 Mental disorders are among the most common causes of disab ility. The resulting disease burden of mental illness is among the highest of all diseases. In any given year, an estimated 18.1% (43.6 million) of U.S. adults ages 18 years or older suffer from any mental illness and 4.2% (9.8 million) suffer from a serio usly debilitating mental illness. Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading cause of disability in the United States, accounting for 18.7% of all years of life lost to disability and premature mortality. Moreover, suicide is the 10th leading cause of deat h in the United States, accounting for the deaths of approximately 43,000 Americans in 2014. Mental health and physical health are closely connected. Mental health plays a major role in people's ability to maintain good physical health. Mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, affect people's ability to participate in health -promoting behaviors. In turn, problems with physical health, such as chronic diseases, can have a serious impact on mental health and decrease a person's ability to participat e in treatment and recovery. The existing model for understanding mental health and mental disorders emphasizes the interaction of social, environmental, and genetic factors throughout the lifespan. In behavioral health, researchers identify: Risk factor s, which predispose individuals to mental illness Protective factors, which protect them from developing mental disorders Researchers now know that the prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral (MEB) disorders is inherently interdisciplinary and dra ws on a variety of different strategies. Over the past 20 years, research on the prevention of mental disorders has progressed. The understanding of how the brain functions under normal conditions and in response to stressors, combined with knowledge of h ow the brain develops over time, has been essential to that progress. The major areas of progress include evidence that:13 MEB disorders are common and begin early in life The greatest opportunity for prevention is among young people There are multiyear ef fects of multiple preventive interventions on reducing substance abuse, conduct disorder, antisocial behavior, aggression, and child maltreatment The incidence of depression among pregnant women and adolescents can be reduced School -based violence preventi on can reduce the base rate of aggressive problems in an average school by 25 to 33 percent Improving family functioning and positive parenting can have positive outcomes on mental health and can reduce poverty -related risk Implementation is complex, and i t is important that interventions be relevant to the target audiences Emerging Issues in Mental Health New mental health issues have emerged among some special populations, such as: 12 Healthy People 2020; https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics -objectives/ topic/mental -health -and-mental -objectives/topic/mental -health -and-mental -disorders HMH Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (xiv) New Solutions, Inc. Veterans who experience physical and mental trauma People in communities with large -scale psychological trauma caused by natural disasters Older adults, as the understanding and treatment of dementia and mood disorders continues to improve As the Federal Government continues to implement health reform legislation, it will give attention to providing services for individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders, including new opportunities for access to and coverage for treatment and prevention services. Substance Abuse Substance abuse refers to a set of related conditions associated with the consumption of mind - and behavior -altering substances that have negative behavioral and health outcomes. Social attitudes and political and legal responses to the consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs make substan ce abuse one of the most complex public health issues. In 2005, an estimated 22 million Americans struggled with a drug or alcohol problem. Almost 95 percent of people with substance use problems are considered unaware of their problem. Of those who reco gnize their problem, 273,000 have made an unsuccessful effort to obtain treatment. These estimates highlight the importance of increasing prevention efforts and improving access to treatment for substance abuse and co -occurring disorders. Substance abuse has a major impact on individuals, families, and communities. The effects of substance abuse are cumulative, significantly contributing to costly social, physical, mental, and public health problems. These problems include: Teenage pregnancy Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) Other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Domestic violence Child abuse Motor vehicle crashes Physical fights Crime Homicide Suicide Improvements in brain -imagi ng technologies and the development of medications that assist in treatment have gradually shifted the research community's perspective on substance abuse. Improved evaluation of community -level prevention has enhanced researchers' understanding of enviro nmental and social factors that contribute to the initiation and abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs, leading to a more sophisticated understanding of how to implement evidence -based strategies in specific social and cultural settings. A stronger emphasis on evaluation has expanded evidence -based practices for drug and alcohol treatment. Improvements have focused on the development of better clinical interventions through research and increasing the skills and qualifications of treatment providers. Emerging Issues in Substance Abuse In recent years, the impact of substance and alcohol abuse has been notable across several areas, including the following14: 14 A comprehensive listing can be found at https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/to pics-objectives/topic/mental -health -and-mental -disorders HMH Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (xv) New Solutions, Inc. Adolescent abuse of prescription drugs has continued to rise over the past 5 years. The 2007 MTF survey found high rates of nonmedical use of the prescription pain relievers Vicodin and OxyContin. It is believed that 2 factors have led to the increase in abuse. First, the availability of prescription drugs is increasing from many sources, includ ing the family medicine cabinet, the Internet, and doctors. Second, many adolescents believe that prescription drugs are safer to take than street drugs. With respect to mental health and substance abuse issues among Middlesex County residents: County -wide adults who report 14 or more of the past 30 days with \"not good\" mental health status increase 2.7 percentage points from 8.1% in 2012 to 10.8% in 2015. The 2015 Middlesex County report of 14+/30 days with \"not good\" mental health is similar to New Jersey at 10.9%. County -wide suicide rate trend s upward from 2005 through 2014 peaking at 7.3/100,000 in 2009. Despite declining 14.5% between 2010 and 2014, the 2014 rate of 5.9/100,000 remains higher than 2004 rate of 5.0/100,000. Since 2010, the su icide rate in Middlesex County is lower than Statewide. The suicide rate of 5.9/100,000 is lower than the Healthy People 2020 target of 10.2/100,000. County -wide adults who partook in alcohol binge drinking decrease 14.7% between 2011 and 2015. Since 2015, the percent of Middlesex County residents reporting binge drink ing is consistently lower than Statewide and surrounding counties. County -wide adults who partook in alcohol heavy drinking increase slightly , 3.3% , between 2011 and 2015. Since 2015, th e percent of Middlesex County residents reporting heavy drinking is consistently lower than Statewide and surrounding counties. County -wide individuals with alcohol or drug induced inpatient hospitalization trend s upward from 2009 through 2015, increasing 29.8% from 2011 to 2015. Since 2011, the percent of Middlesex County residents with alcohol or drug induced inpatient hospitalization is consistently lower than the State. County -wide individuals with alcohol or drug induced emergency department visits tr ends upward from 2009 through 2015, increasing 19.8% from 2011 to 2015. Since 2011, the percent of Middlesex County residents with alcohol or drug induced emergency department visits is consistently lower than the State and surrounding counties. With respect to mental Health and s ubstance Abuse issues among Service Area residents15: Perth Amboy has the highest incidence rate for m ental health and substance abuse in the Service Area. Perth Amboy's mental health and substance abuse incidence rates are more than double that of Middlesex County. Inpatient mental health rates for RBMC -PA and RBMC -OB Service Areas are higher than Middlesex County but lower than the State. Perth Amboy's rate is higher than all comparative figures. Old Bridge is lower than the Service Area s and the State and is similar to the County figure. ED mental health rates in the RBMC -PA Service Area are higher than the County but lower than Statewide. Perth Amboy's rate is more than double the County and exceeds the Statewide rate 15 Source: NJ UB -04 Acute Care IP, Same Day Stay, ER Discharges (2012 - 2015), Population: 2010, 2016 Nielsen -Claritas/HCDA, 2011 & 2015 Straight Line Value Based on 2010 and 2017, Definition: Inpatie nt, Same Day Stay and ED Discharges - MDCs 19 and 20 HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (xvi) New Solutions, Inc. by more than 6 points. RBMC -OB Service Area and Old Bridge rates are below County and State figures. Inpatient substance abuse use rates in RBMC -PA and RBMC -OB Service Areas, as well as Old Bridge rates are all below the State rate. Perth Amboy's rate is .5 point higher than the State and 1.2 point higher than the County. ED Substance abuse rate in RBMC -PA Service Area exceeds the County and State. Perth Amboy is more than double the County rate and nearly double the State figure. RBMC -OB Service Area rates and Old Bridge are lower than County and Statewide figures. 5. Access to Health Services Improved access to comprehensive, quality health care services is inextricably linked to successful impacts on numerous health factors and outcomes, including RBMC's four other priority areas. Access to health services is a Healthy People 2020 goal. The wide -ranging impacts on health related to access issues that populations may face are outlined below. Access to comprehensive, quality health care services i s important for promoting and maintaining health, preventing and managing disease, reducing unnecessary disability and premature death, and achieving health equity for all Americans. When considering access to health care, it is important to also include oral health care and obtaining necessary prescription drugs. Access to health services means \"the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best health outcomes.\" It requires 3 distinct steps: Entering the health care system (usually throu gh insurance coverage) Accessing a location where needed health care services are provided (geographic availability) Finding a health care provider whom the patient trusts and can communicate with (personal relationship) Barriers to health services includ e: High cost of care Inadequate or no insurance coverage Lack of availability of services Lack of culturally competent care These barriers to accessing health services lead to: Unmet health needs Delays in receiving appropriate care Inability to get preventive services Financial burdens Preventable hospitalizations Access to health care impacts one's overall physical, social, and mental health status and quality of life and often varies based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, sex, disabi lity status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and residential location. HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (xvii) New Solutions, Inc. Health insurance coverage helps patients enter the health care system. Lack of adequate coverage makes it difficult for people to get the health care they need and, when they do g et care, burdens them with large medical bills. Uninsured people are: More likely to have poor health status Less likely to receive medical care More likely to be diagnosed later More likely to die prematurely Improving access to health care services depends in part on ensuring that people have a usual and ongoing source of care (that is, a provider or facility where one regularly receives care). People with a usual source of care have better health outcomes, fewer disparities, and lower costs. Having a primary care provider (PCP) who serves as the usual source of care is especially important. PCPs can develop meaningful and sustained relationships with patients and provide integrated services while practicing in the context of family and community. Hav ing a usual PCP is associated with: Greater patient trust in the provider Better patient -provider communication Increased likelihood that patients will receive appropriate care Lower mortality from all causes Improving health care services includes incre asing access to and use of evidence -based preventive services. Clinical preventive services are services that: Prevent illness by promoting healthy behaviors in people without risk factors (e.g., diet and exercise counseling) Prevent illness by providing protection to those at risk (e.g., childhood vaccinations) Identify and treat people with no symptoms, but who have risk factors, before the clinical illness develops (e.g., screening for hypertension or colorectal cancer) In addition to primary care and preventive services, emergency medical services (EMS) are a crucial link in the chain of care. EMS include basic and advanced life support. Notable progress has been made in recent years to ensure that everyone has access to rapidly responding EMS; it is a n important effort in improving the health of the population. Timeliness is the health care system's ability to provide health care quickly after a need is recognized. Measures of timeliness include: Availability of appointments and care for illness or injury when it is needed Time spent waiting in doctors' offices and emergency departments (EDs) The delay in time between identifying a need for a specific test or treatment and receiving those services can negatively impact health and costs of care. For example, delays in getting care can lead to: Increased emotional distress HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 (xviii) New Solutions, Inc. Increased complications Higher treatment costs Increased hospitalizations Actual and perceived difficulties or delays in getting care when patients are ill or injured likely reflec t significant barriers to care. Prolonged ED wait time: Decreases patient satisfaction Increases the number of patients who leave before being seen Is associated with clinically significant delays in care Causes for increased ED wait times include an inc rease in the number of patients going to EDs, with much of the increase due to visits by less acutely ill patients. At the same time, the total number of EDs in the United States has decreased. With respect to Access to Care issues among Middlesex County and Service Area residents: Despite almost doubling from 2008 through 2014 within Middlesex County, the ratio of population to physicians decreased slightly at 1.8% from 2011 to 2014. From 2008 through 2014, the ratio of population to primary care physici ans in Middlesex County was lower than Statewide. The 2014 Middlesex County population to primary care physician ratio is above the County Health Rankings benchmark of 1,051:1. Since 2010, the nonelderly population without health insurance in Middlesex C ounty has trended downward, decreasing 20% from 2011 to 2014. From 2008 through 2012, Middlesex County and the State both reported 15% uninsured. However, in 2013 and 2014, Middlesex County had slightly fewer uninsured than Statewide. The percent of the no nelderly population without health insurance far exceed the Healthy People 2020 target of 0 and falls within range of the County Health Rankings benchmark of 15%. In 2015, ENT is the leading ACSC for children resulting in an ED visit, followed by asthma, GI obstruction, kidney/urinary infection and cellulitis. Middlesex County had higher rates of ENT and asthma than Statewide. HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 - 1 - New Solutions, Inc. 1.

CHNA PURPOSE AND SCOPE The Public Health Accreditation Board defines a Community Health Needs Assessment as a \"systematic examination of the health status indicators for a given population used to identify key problems and assets in a community. \" The ultimate goal of the CHNA process is to develop strategies through an Implementation Plan to address the community's health needs and identified issues. Essential components to successful assessment and implementation are community engagement and coll aborative participation. In June 2011, t he National Prevention Council, created through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010, was tasked with the development of a National Prevention Strategy to realize the law's efforts to reduce costs, improve quality of care, and provide coverage options for the uninsured . The Council's overarching goal to increase the number of healthy Americans at every stage of life is achieve d through four Strategic Directives and seven targeted Priorities. The Strategic Directi ves recommend ed for developing a prevention -oriented society include: HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 - 2 - New Solutions, Inc. Healthy and Safe Community Environments : Create, sustain, and recognize communities that promote health and wellness through prevention. Clinical and Community Prevention Services: Ensure that prevention -focused healthcare and community prevention efforts are available, integrated, and mutually reinforcing. Empowered People: Support people in making healthy choices. Elimination of Health Disparities: Eliminate disparities, improving t he quality of life for all Americans. With this framework, the seven targeted Priorities provide directives most likely to reduce the burden of many leading causes of preventable death and major illness es are : Tobacco Free Living Preventing Drug Abuse and Excessive Alcohol Use Healthy Eating Active Living Injury and Violence Free Living Reproductive and Sexual Health Mental and Emotional Well -Being This RBMC Community Health Needs Assessment is undertaken in this context , and developed for the purpose of enhancing the health and quality of life throughout its community. Key health outcomes, factors, and s ocial determinants of healt h are presented and as available are compared to County, State and national benchmarks . SUMMARY OF 2014 CHNA After reviewing secondary source data, primary research and engaging in priority and plan development, the Community Advisory Task Force determined the Top 5 issues to be addressed in the 2014 Community Health Implementation Plan were : 1. Healthy Nutrition/Obesity 2. Mental Health and Alcohol/Substance Abuse 3. Heart Disease & Stroke 4. Diabetes 5. Cancer Members agreed that although these issues were highest priorities and primary foci, many lower ranked issues were intertwined and therefore would gain peripheral attention. Some issues, including poverty or education, classified as social determinants of health and health status, were acknowledged but the members recognized they may b e unable to impact these areas. Since 2014 , RBMC has provided numerous community health programs and services, including prevention, education, and wellness screenings. Many of these programs are ongoing and RBMC staff work s in partnership with local community organizations and agencies to enhance efforts in addressing community health needs. Key activities include: partnering with the Middlesex County Prosecu tor's Office to combat the opioid overdose epidemic; launching the Learning Garden to promote positive health behaviors and increase nutrition education; implementing the Heart Failure Transitions in Care Program to reduce readmission rates for all chronic cardiac conditions and increasing funding and; partnering with the Joslin Diabetes Center to deliver diabetes education and enhance patient self -management.

METHODOLOGY MEETINGS WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AGENCY AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RBMC convened a group of community stakeholders, civic leaders, provider agencies, the County Health Department, and community -based organizations to serve in an ongoing community a dvisory capacity at the beginning of the CHNA process. Data obtained from the qualitative analys es provide insight into health issues facing the communities served by the Medical Center . The Task Force met five times during the planning process. Meeting s included: Where Are We Now? A Review 2014 CHNA Priorities & Accomplishments County -Wide Health Indicators Presentation Service -Area Health Indicators Presentation Priority Setting and Strategy Development Implementation Plan Development SECONDARY DATA SOURCE S Over 30 secondary data sources are included in this Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA); m ost data are presented at county level . Sources include the United States Census Bureau, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), New Jersey De partment of Health (NJDOH), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and the County Health Rankings . For a comprehensive listing of sources , see Appendix B. The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion at the Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) , provide s a framework for promoting a healthy society through the identification of national health improvement priorities and objectives. Appreciating the role of social and physical environments in addition to their impact on health outcomes and conditions is vital to achieving Healthy People 2020 objectives.16 County Health Rankings17 (CHR) , a collaborative effort of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute , seek s to build awareness of factors influencing health by providing local data to aid community stakeholders in identifying areas of improve ment . CHR compiles data from multiple sources and can be used for health improvement efforts at the local or regional level. Counties nation wide are ranked by state according to how healthy they currently are, which CHR refers to as health outcomes, and how healthy a county will be, referred to as health factors. Rankings include a range of measures such as high school graduation rates, air pollution levels, income, rates of obesity and smoking. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the nation's premier system of health -related telephone surveys, collects data about U.S. residents regarding health -related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions and use of preventive services. In 1984 the survey began collecting data in 15 states and is currently conducted in all state s includ ing Washington D.C. and three United States territories. The m ost recent data available are for the year 2015. 16 https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/About -Healthy -People 17 http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/about -project HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 - 4 - New Solutions, Inc. COLOR INDICATOR LIGHTS / TABLES Throughout the Health Profile Section of this document , the reader will encounter summary tables including red, yellow and green colored indicators. These tables illustrate a comparison of county -level data to Healthy People 2020 targets, Community Health Rankings benchmarks and New Jersey State data. Data by race/ethnicity is compared to data for a ll races with in the county, unless otherwise noted . For over three decades, Healthy People established benchmarks and monitored progress to measure impact of prevention activities. If Middlesex County, a defined Service Area or specific ZIP Code performs better than the Healthy People 2020 target , the color indicator located in the summary table will be green. If the County, defined Service Area or a specific ZIP Code performs lower than the Health y People 2020 target by more than 25%, the indicator will be red. Yellow indicat es that the County, defined Service Area or specific ZIP Code is lower than the Health y People 2020 target but within an established 25% margin. County Health Rankings (CHR), ranks the health of nearly all counties in the United Stat es. The same methodology utilized for Healthy People 2020 targets is applied to CHR data. If Middlesex County, a defined Service Area or specific ZIP Code performs better than the CHR benchmark, the color indicator located in the summary table will be gre en. If the County, defined Service Area or specific ZIP Code performs lower than the CHR benchmark by more than 25%, the indicator will be red. Yellow indicat es that the County, defined Service Area or specific ZIP Code is lower than the CHR benchmark , but within an established 25% margin.

A green indicator represents a county which ranks in the top 25% of the State , a yellow indicator signifies those counties ranked in the second or third quartile s. A red indicator identifies that the in the lowest performing quartile as compared to all 21 New Jersey counties. USE RATES ZIP Code level data are provided , wherever possible , to enhance the understanding of specific needs of Service Area residents . To obtain comparable data on disease burden in the region, disease rates among patients using hospital services are developed and analyzed for Middlesex County, Service Area s, Perth Amboy and Old Bridge. Calculated rates of disease among hospitalized patients include inpatient, emergency department and same day data. The 2014 CHNA report s data from 2009 through 2012. The 2017 edition of this report contains data from 2012 through 2015. Variability exists in comparing the 2012 data s ets across documents as population projections utilized in this version have been updated. The variability is nominal and does not impact efficacy of the data. PRIORITY SETTING An on -line survey , administered via Survey Monkey , was distributed to 116 co mmunity leaders between August 25, 2017 and September 5, 2017. The survey asked participants to assess areas of opportunity across seven criteria.

Low birth weight infants (less than 2,500 grams) are at an increased risk for health problems ranging from neurodevelopmental disabilities to respiratory disorders.34 Racial disparities in low birth weight babies persist; nationally, non -Hispanic Black infants continue to die at nearly twice the rate of non -Hispan ic Whites. Low Birth Weight In 2015, 7.5% of Middlesex County babies are low birth weight as compared to 8.1% statewide; the County rank s within the middle quartile among all 21 New Jersey counties. The 2015 percent of Middlesex County low birth weight babies is better than the Healthy People 2020 target of 7.8%; this exhibits an improvement from the previous CHNA as the 2010 County percentage of 8.4% exceeded the low birth weight target. The percentage of Middlesex County low birthweigh t babies decrease s for all race/ethnicities between 2011 and 2015. o In 2015, Hispanics have the smallest percentage (6.7%) of low birth weight babies as compared to Whites (7.9% ) and Blacks (9.9% ) in Middlesex County. o The Middlesex County 2015 percent of Black low birth weight babies is 25% higher than Whites. In 2015, Middlesex County rank s within the middle quartile compared to all New Jersey counties for Black low birth weight babies. Very low birth weight babies (less than 1,500 grams ) are at greater risk of adverse outcomes than low birth weight babies. Very Low Birth Weight In 2015, 1.3% of Middlesex County babies are very low birth weight as compared to 1.4% statewide; the County rank s within the middle quartile compared to all New Jersey counties. The 2015 percent of very low birth weight babies in Middlesex County is better than the Healthy People 2020 target of 1.4%. By race, between 2011 and 2015, the percentage of very low birthweight babies remain stable for Whites at 1.2% , decrease fr om 3.2% to 2.4% for Blacks and increase slightly from 1.2% to 1.3% for Hispanics. o In 2015, Middlesex County Whites has the smallest percentage (1.2%) of very low birth weight babies as compared to Blacks (2.4% ) and Hispanics (1.3%). o The Middlesex County 2015 percent of Black (2.4%) very low birth weight babies is double Whites (1.2%). In 2015, Middlesex County rank s within the middle quartile compared to all New Jersey counties for Black very low birth weight b abies. 34 http://www.cdc.gov/PEDNSS/how_to/interpret_data/case_studies/low_birthweight/what.htm HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 - 22 - New Solutions, Inc.

Health Status and Behavioral Health Status Health status and behavioral health status are broad multidimensional concepts including self-report measures of physical and mental health. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the nation's premier system of health -related telephone surveys, collects data about U.S. residents regarding health -related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions and use of preventive services. In 1984 the survey began collecting data in 15 states and is currently conducted in all state s includ ing Washington D.C. and three United States territories. The m ost recent data available are for the year 2015. General Health Status Between 2012 and 2015, BRFSS data report s a small increase in the percent of Middlesex County residents who indicate their health as \"poor or fair ,\" from 13.0 % to 1 3.5%. In 2015, 15.0% of New Jersey residents report that their health is \"fair or poor,\" higher than Middlesex County at 13.5%; Middlesex County has fewer persons with \"fair or poor\" health than Union County (16.2%) and slightly more than 1.3% 1.2%3.2% 2.1%2.4% 1.2%1.5%1.3% 0%1%2%3%4% Non Hispanic Black, Non Hispanic HispanicHMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 - 24 - New Solutions, Inc.

The three most common t ypes of diabetes are Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational. Individuals with diabetes may develop serious health complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, amputation and premature death. Type 1 develops when insulin producing cells located in the pancreas are destroyed. There is no known way to prevent Type 1 diabetes . In order t o survive, Type 1 diabet ics must have insulin delivered by injection or pump. Type 2 primarily onsets with insulin resistance, a disorder in which cells within the muscles, liver, and fat tissue are unable to properly use insulin. Higher risk for developing Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age, obesity, family history of diabetes , history of gestational diabetes , impaired glucose metabolism, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity. African Americans, Hispanics/L atinos, American Indians, some Asians, and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for Type 2. Gestational diabetes is a form of glucose intolerance diagnosed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The risk factors for gestational Diabetes are similar to those for t ype 2 diabetes .58 Diabetes is increasing among Middlesex County residents. Between 2012 (8.4%) and 2015 (9.9 %), an additional 1.5 percentage point increase of County residents report having the disease.

Arthritis describe s more than 100 rheumatic diseases and conditions that affect joints, the tissues which surround the joint and other connective tissue. The pattern, sev erity and location of symptoms vary depending on the specific form of the disease. Typically, rheumatic conditions are characterized by pain and stiffness in and around one or more joints. The symptoms can develop gradually or suddenly.63 Between 2012 and 2015, the percentage of Middlesex County residents reporting arthritis increases from 15.4% to 20.9%.

HEALTH FACTORS Health factors represent the influences that impact one's health. These include demographic , social, environmental, economic, and individual behaviors as well as clinical care and access to services. Social determinants are described in Section C following Health Factors . A focus on social determinants of health is an important primary approach to achieving health equity. 1. Demographics Age Health disparities exist in all age groups. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that although life expectancy and overall health has improved for most Americans, older adults are not benefitting equally due to economic status, race and g ender. While the overall concentration of older adults in Middlesex County is slightly smaller than New Jersey, there are a number of municipalities within the county that have larger concentrations than statewide . By 2022, the population over 65 in Middle sex County is projected to increase 18.4% and the Statewide increase is projected to increase 16.0% from 2017. According to 2017 population estimates, Monroe (33.7%) has more than two times the number of residents aged 65+ as compared to Middlesex County (14.2%). Between 2017 and 2022, New Jersey is projected to have a 1.6 % decline among 0-17 year olds, Perth Amboy, however, anticipates a 2.5% increase in this age cohort. Perth Amboy 's overall projected population growth (3.5% ) between 2 017 and 2022 is nearly double that of the State (1.8%). Women of child -bearing age (15 -44) comprise 20.2% of Middlesex County 's 2017 population and are projected to decrease by 0.9% in 2022. Similarly, women age 15 -44 comprise 21.7% of the Perth Amboy pop ulation and are projected to decrease 1.0%, in line with the State.

Race and Ethnicity Despite notable progress in the overall health of the Nation, there remain morbidity and mortality disparities by race and ethnicity . The proportion of cohorts which experienc e poorer health status are anticipated to grow; therefore, the future health of America can be influenced by improving the health of these minorities. In Middlesex County, the percentage of non -white population incr ease s across all racial and ethnic group s while the percentage of white residents ha s decline s, heightening the vital need for addressing disparities in health and care among these groups.67 According to 2017 population estimates , 42.2% of Middlesex County , 67.5% of Monroe and 10.7% of Perth Amboy residents are White as compared to 54.9% statewide. In 2017, 20.4% of New Jersey residents are Hispanic, approximately one -quarter of the percentage of Perth Amboy (79.6%) residents. The Hispanic population in Mi ddlesex County increase s 18.6% from 2010 through 2017. In 2017, 24.6% of Middlesex County residents are Asian, nearly 2 \u00bd times New Jersey (9.6%).

Cesarean Section A Cesarean Section (C -section) is a major surgical procedure performed because of health problems in the mother, position of the baby , and/or distress in the infant.72 The U.S. cesarean delivery rate reached a high of 32.9% of all births in 2009, rising 60% from 1996 (20.7%) . Recently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists developed clinical guidelines for reducing the occurrence of non - medically indicated cesarean delivery and labor induction prior to 39 weeks. Efforts to reduce such births include initiatives to improve perinatal care quality, changes in hos pital policy to disallow elective delivery prior to 39 weeks and education of the public.73 Middlesex County's 2015 primary C -section rate (25.9%) is similar to the State rate (26.0%). As compared to the State, Middlesex County rank s in the lowest performi ng quartile of all 21 New Jersey counties.

Health Behaviors Maternal / Fetal Health Prenatal Care The medical care a woman receives during pregnancy monitors her health and the developing fetus. Low - risk pregnancies should visit a prenatal provider every four or six weeks through 28 weeks then every two or three weeks from weeks 28 -36 and finally every week in the ninth month until delivery. A high -risk pregnancy require s additional visits.79 Pregnant women who do not receive adequate prenatal care risk undetected complications and an increase d possibility of adverse outcomes. Early and regular prenatal care is a strategy to improve health outcomes for mothers and infants. Two significant benefits are improved birth weight and decreased preterm delivery. Infants born to mothers who receive no prenatal care have an infant mortalit y rate five times higher than mothers who receive appropriate prenatal care since the first trimester of pregnancy. Enrollment in care during the first trimester of pregnancy reflects timely initiation of prenatal care .80 In 2015, 6.5% more Middlesex Count y (78.4%) women enter ed prenatal care in the first trimester than in New Jersey (73.6 %). As compared to New Jersey, Middlesex County ranks in the middle quartile. Middlesex County women enrolled in first trimester prenatal ca re decline s 9.0% between 2011 (86.2%) and 2015 (78.4%). In 2015, Middlesex County perform s better than the Healthy People 2020 target of 77.9% women enrolled in first trimester care.

Figure 4. 58 Percentage of Live Births with No Prenatal Care82 High Risk Sexual Behaviors Teen Pregnancy In 2013, there were 26.6 births /1,000 American adolescent females age s 15-19; approximately 275,000 babies were born to teens with n early eighty -nine percent of these births occurr ing outside of marriage. The teen birth rate has trended downward over the past 20 years. In 1991, the U.S. teen birth rate was 61.8 births /1,000 adolescent females . However, the U.S. teen birth rate remains higher than that of many other developed countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom.83 Pregnant teens are less likely than older women to receive recommended prenatal care and are more likely to have pre -term or low birth weight babies. Teen mothers are often at increased risk for STIs and repeat pregnancies, are less likely than their peers to complete high school and more likely to live below the poverty level and rely on public assistance. Risky sexual behaviors can have high economic costs f or commun ities and individuals.84 The 2008 -2014 Midd lesex County birth rate among teens aged 15 -19 is 29.5% better than the State rate (19 .0/1,000) and in the top performing quartile statewide.

Tobacco Use Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable deat h in the United States. Smoking causes cancer , heart disease, stroke, diabetes , and lung diseases such as emphysema, bronchitis, and chronic airway obstruction . Exposure to secondhand smoke can lead to lung cancer and heart disease. Each year, smoking kills approximately 480,000 Americans, including 42,000 from secondhand smoke. On average, smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers. About 18% of US adults smoke. Each day, nearly 3,200 youth smoke their first cigarette, and 2,100 people transition from occasional to daily smokers. Smokeless tobacco also lead s to various cancer s, gum and teeth problems, and nicotine addiction.

Alcohol Use Although moderate alcohol use is associated with reduced ris k of heart disease and diabetes , excessive consumption is the third leading cause of preventable death nationally . Excessive consumption considers both the amount and the frequency of drinking. Short -term , excessive drinking is linked to alcohol poisonin g, intimate partner violence, risky sexual behaviors, failure to fulfill responsibilities and motor vehicle crashes . Over time, excessive alcohol consumption is a risk factor for hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, fetal alcohol syndrome, liver dise ase and certain cancer s.94 Binge drinkers, those men that consume more than 5 drinks and women that consume more than 4 drinks in one occasion, increase 21.8% from 2013 (11.9%) to 2015 (14.5%) .

Cancer Screening Breast Cancer (mammography) According to the American Cancer Association, w omen ages 40 to 44 should have the choice to start annual breast cancer screening with mammograms (x -rays of the breast) if they wish to do so. Women age 45 to 54 should get mammograms every year. Women 55 and older should switch to mammograms every 2 years, or can continue yearly screening. Screening should continue as long as a woman is in good health and is expected to live 10 more years or longer. Women should also know how their breasts normally look and feel and report any breast changes to a health care provider right away. Some women - because of their family history, a genetic tendency, or certain other factors - should be screened with MRIs along with mammogram s. The number of women who fall into this category is very small. In 2014 , 10.5 % more Middlesex County women over age 40 (26.3 %) did not have a mammography within the past two years than s tatewide (23.8 %). Compared to all counties statewide, Middlesex performs in the middle quartile. In 2012, 24.6 % fewer Middlesex County women did not have a mammography in the last two years than in 2014 (26.3 %).

Figure 4. 71 Mammography: Percent of Women Age 40+ Who Have Not Had a Mammogram within the Past Two Years102 Cervical Cancer (pap smear) According to the American Cancer Association, c ervical cancer testing should start at age 21. Women between the ages of 21 and 29 should have a Pap test done every 3 years. Women between the ages of 30 and 65 should have a Pap test plus an HPV test (called \"co -testing\") do ne every 5 years. Women over age 65 who have regular cervical cancer testing in the past 10 years with normal results should not be tested for cervical cancer. Women with a history of a serious cervical pre -cancer should continue to be tested for at least 20 years after that diagnosis, even if testing goes past age 65. Some women - because of their health history (HIV infection, organ transplant, DES exposure, etc.) - may need a different screening schedule for cervical cancer. In 2014 , 76% of Middlesex County women over age 18 have a pap smear within the past three years as compared to 83.6% of New Jersey women 18+ . Fewer Middlesex County women over age 18 have a pap test within 3 yea rs than in comparative Union (85.7%) and Monmouth (87.6%) Counties.

Immunizations It is better to prevent disease than to treat it after it occurs ; vaccines prevent disease and save millions of lives. Vaccines introduce the antigens that cause diseases. Immunity , the body's means to preventing disease , recognizes germs and produces antibodies to fight them. Even after many years, the immune system continues to produce antibodies to thwart disease from recurring . Through vaccination we can develop immunity without suffering from disease .111 Childhood Immunizations : DPT, polio, MMR & Hib (aged 19 -35 months) Young c hildren are readily susceptible to disease and the consequences can be serious or life- threatening. Childhood immunizations minimize impact of vaccine preventable diseases. Combined 4 vaccine series ( 4:3:1 :3) refers to 4 or more doses of DTP/DT, 3 or more doses of poliovirus vaccine, 1 or more doses of MCV and 3 or more doses of Hib .112 Conflicting information in the news and on the internet about children's immunizations may cause vaccine hesitancy among select parents. The percent of Middlesex County children meeting all vaccine requirements in 2016 is the same as the State at 95%. Figure 4. 80 Childhood Immunization : Percent of Children Meeting All Immunization Requirements, 2016113 Adult Flu Immunizations are not just for children. As we age, the immune system weaken s putting us at higher risk for certain diseases. Greater than 60 percent of seasonal flu -related hospital izations occur in pe ople 65 and older.

Middlesex is ranked 11/21 New Jersey counties with 9.0% of residents sustaining an income below poverty. County level analysis mas ks concentrated poverty. In 2015, among municipalities with populations above 20,000 and poverty rates above 15% , Perth Amboy has the 13th highest poverty level (19.8%) among individuals and 12th highest among families (19.8%) .128 According to the Census, in 20 15, Middlesex County (9.0%) has fewer individuals living below the Federal Poverty Level than New Jersey (10.8%). Perth Amboy and Carteret have among the highest poverty rates and exceed those of the State. The 2015 ACS Survey reports 19.8% of Perth Amboy families a nd 11.1% of Carteret families a re living below the FPL compared to 6.5% in Middlesex County and 8.2% statewide . The RBMC -OB Service Area poverty rate among individuals is better than Middlesex County, Perth Amboy and New Jersey, while the RBMC -PA Service Area poverty rate among individuals exceeds Middlesex County and is lower than the percentage for New Jersey. Regarding poverty, the percent of individuals living below the FPL, Middlesex County ranks among the middle quartile relative to all 21 New Jersey counties. 127 https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics -objectives/topic/social -determinants -of-health 128 Source: US Census ACS Survey 2015 5 Year Estimates HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 - 74 - New Solutions, Inc.

Health and Health Care Access to affordable quality health care is important to physical, social, and mental health. Health insurance helps individuals and families access needed primary care, specialists, and emergency care, but does not ensure access. It is also necessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients and be near patients.148 146 http://www.stopvaw.org/health_effects_of_domestic_violence 147 Source: NJ Department of Law and Public Safety, Division of State Police - Uniform Crime Reporting Unit http://www.njsp.org/info/stats.html 148 http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/our -approach/health -factors/access -care 7.3 7.0 6.95.9 5.5 5.5 5.4 5.0 4.56.2 6.3 6.1 0510 2013 2014 2015 NJ Middlesex Union MonmouthHMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 - 84 - New Solutions, Inc. Health Insurance Since the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) coverage provisions began taking effect in 2010, the nation's uninsured rate dropped by 7.2 percentage points, from 16 percent. That translates into 20.4 million fewer people who lacked health insurance in 2016 than in 2010. However, the future of the ACA is uncertain and will impact the numbers of uninsured. T he uninsured are less likely to have primary care providers than the insured; they also receive less preventive care, dental care, chronic disease management, and behavioral health counseling. Those without insurance are often diagnosed at later, less treatable disease stages than those with insurance and, overall, have worse health outcomes, lower quality of life, and higher mortality rates. Neighborhoods with low health insurance rates often have fewer providers, hospital beds and emergency resources than areas with higher rates. Even the insured have more difficulty getting care in these areas. Cost can be a barrier to care even for those who have insurance. While improvements in the percentage of persons with insurance occur , residents of Perth Amboy continue to have some of the highest rates of uninsured in the county. Lack of insurance creates barriers to timely access to care for patients and financial burdens to the providers who care for the m. In 2012, 15% of Middlesex County and New Jersey residents report having health coverage. Coverage for Middlesex County residents improve s 20% from 15 % without insurance in 2012 to 12% in 2014. In 2014, Middlesex County (12.0%) exceeds the ambitious Healthy People 2020 target of no person without health coverage . As compared to the CHR benchmark, Middlesex County is lower but within an established 25% margin.

Figure 4. 108 Payer Mix Comparison150 2015 Access to Care Access to affordable quality health care is significant to ensuring physical, social, and mental health. Health insurance assists individuals and families to obtain primary care, specialists, and emergency care, but does not ensure access. Insurance is also necessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients and be near patients.151 Services Improving health care access depends , in part , on ensuring a standard and consistent source of preventive care . One method to accomplish this is patient -centered medical homes. Medical homes may transform the delivery of healthcare by improving quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness and ultima tely result in improved outcomes , fewer disparities and lower costs.152 Conveniently locating medical homes within a community supports access. M edical homes are associated with g reate r patient trust, e ffective communication, i ncreased likelihood to receive appropriate care and d ecreased duplication and disconnection of services.153 Community Need Index 154 The Community Need Index (CNI), jointly developed by Dignity Health and Truven Health in 2004, is strongly linked to variations in community healthcare nee ds and is a strong indicator of a community's demand for services. 150 Source : UB-04 2015 Discharges 151 http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/our -approach/health -factors/access -care 152 http://pcmh.ahrq.gov/ 153 ibid 154 Truven Health Analytics, 2017; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2017; The Nielson Company, 2017; and Community Need Index, 2 017. http://cni.chw -interactive.org/ HMH -Raritan Bay Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 11/15/2017 - 86 - New Solutions, Inc. Based on a wide array of demographic and economic statistics, the CNI provides a score for every populated ZIP Code in the United States. A score of 1.0 indicates a ZIP Co de with the least need and a score of 5.0 represents a ZIP Code with the most need. The CNI should be used as part of a larger community health needs assessment, and can help pinpoint specific areas with greater need than others. The CNI score is an aver age of five barrier scores that measure socio -economic indicators of each community using 2015 source data. The five barriers are: 1. Income Barrier Percentage of households below poverty line, with head of household age 65 or older Percentage of families with children under 18 below poverty line Percentage of single female -headed families with children under 18 below poverty line 2. Cultural Barrier Percentage of population that is minority (including Hispanic ethnicity) Percentage of population over age 5 th at speaks English poorly or not at all 3. Education Barrier Percentage of population over 25 without a high school diploma 4. Insurance Barrier Percentage of population in the labor force, aged 16 or more, without employment Percentage of population without heal th insurance 5. Housing Barrier Percentage of households renting their home A comparison of CNI scores and hospital utilization reveals a strong correlation between need and use. Communities with low CNI scores can be expected to have high hospital utilizat ion. There is a causal relationship between CNI scores and preventable hospitalizations and ED visits for manageable conditions. Communities with high CNI scores may have more hospitalization and ED visits that could have been avoided with improved healt hy community structures and appropriate outpatient and primary care.

Figure 4.110 Perth A mboy's CNI score (4.6) indicates highest need in the Combined Service Area, followed by Carteret (4.2), South River (3.6), Avenel (3.4) and Woodbridge (3.4). Conversely, Englishtown's score (1.4) represent s the lowest CNI score in the Combined Service Area, followed by Helmetta (1.8), M onroe Township (2.0), East Brunswick (2.0) and Spotswood (2.2). Timeliness of Service A key indicator of the timeliness of service is emergency department (ED) utilization for conditions that could have been treated in a primary care setting . Reasons fo r accessing the ED instead of a more appropriate, lower acuity level of care include: No regular source of primary care Lack of health insurance Cost Transportation Office hours Citizenship status ED Utilization for Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditi ons Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC) are potentially preventable medical conditions that are treated in the ED although more appropriate care should have been provided in a non-emergent outpatient primary care setting . ED utilization rates may be reduced by addressing primary care access issues. Middlesex rank s 16/21 counties with 44.81/1,000 ACSC ED visits in 2015, a 14.9% decrease in the ACSC ED rate from 2012.
