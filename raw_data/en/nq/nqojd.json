Ayurveda means the \"science of life\". Ayurvedic medicine promotes whole-body healing in contrast to Western medicine, which separates spiritual, mental, and physical health. Followers of Ayurveda follow the traditional diet and engage in regular detoxes to rid the mind and body of toxins. However, health experts are doubtful about this detox's supposed benefits. Now, you might be wondering if you should try an Ayurvedic detox or not. This article provides a comprehensive review of the importance of detoxification in Ayurveda, its effectiveness, how it works, and its beautiful results. A detoxification process is medicinal and it refers to the removal of toxins from your body. Our kidneys, liver, lymphatic systems, and intestines do detoxification regularly. Then, what is the need for additional detoxification for our body? In our day-to-day life, we are exposed to many chemicals from the food we eat, the air we breathe, the cosmetics we use, to the cleaning agents we use. To flush these toxins out and keep our kidneys and liver healthy, detoxification becomes a vital part of your health. Proponents of Ayurveda claim that detox helps cleanse your body of toxins and promotes overall health. While scientists have doubts about its effectiveness, certain components prove to be beneficial. Even though weight loss is not the end goal of detox, people trying to lose weight may find some elements of detox helpful. The [Ayurvedic detoxification treatment](https://www.ayurvedacollege.net/ayurveda-treatments) is based on the long-established precepts of Ayurveda. Ayurveda has divided the world into five elements: Prithvi (earth), Vayu (air), Aakash (space), Teja (fire), and Jala (water). Combinations of these elements form doshas which are responsible for different physiological functions of your body. Vata, Kapha, and Pitta are the three doshas in Ayurveda. To ensure good health, you have to maintain a balance between the three doshas and the five elements. If any imbalances occur, diseases are bound to happen. Detoxes are a routine part of restoring your health. Every person has a unique balance of doshas based on their personality traits and genetics. An Ayurvedic practitioner can assist you in identifying your dosha. Although Ayurvedic practices like mindful eating and increased intake of legumes and vegetables intake are healthy, detox poses many health risks.
