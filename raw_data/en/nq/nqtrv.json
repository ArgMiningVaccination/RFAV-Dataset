Treaty of Peace, Friendship, Navi- gation and Commerce between the United States of America and the Republic ofEcuador. Concluded and signed at Quito on the 13 June 1839. (Acts an Resolutions passed at the third Session of the 27 Congress of the United States Washington, 1843 Appendix S. 1-23). The United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador, desiring to make lasting and firm, the frien- dship and good understanding which happily prevails between both nations, have resolved to fix, in a man- ner clear, distinct and positive, the rules which shall, in future, be religiously observed between the one and the other, by means of a treaty of friendship, com- merce and navigation. For this most desirable object, the President of the United States of America has con- ferred fullpowers on James C.Pickett, a citizen of the said States, and the President of the Republic ofEcua- dor, on Doctor Luis de Sad, Minister of Finance char- ged with the Departement of the Interior and Foreign Relations; who, after having exchanged their said full powers, in due and proper form, have agreed to the following articles: Art. I. There shall be a perfect, firm and inviolable peace and sincere friendship, between the United -Sta- tes of America and the Republic of Ecuador, in all the extent of their possessions and territories, and between their people and citizens, respectively, without distinc- tion of persons or places. Art. II. The United States of America and the Re- public of Ecuador, desiring to live in peace and har- mony with all the other nations of de earth, by means of a policy, frank and equally friendly with all, engage mutually, not to grant any particular favor to other nations, in respect of commerce and navigation, which shall not immediately become common to the other party, who shall enjoy the same freely, if the conces-299 Trailte entre les por cuanto, una ley del Ecuador, fecha de Marzo 21 de 1837, dispone, que los en los Unidos, y que no se impodran 6 conbrariin otros 6 mas altos derechos de tonelada, ' por el cargamento, ya sea que la importacion se haga en buques de la una 6 de en los buques de Republica del Ecuador, y no se inpodrin 6 cobraran otros 6 mas altos derechos de tonelada 6 por el cargamento, ya sea qIe la importacion se haga en bu- ques de la una 6 de la otra.

The two high contracting parties, being likewise desirous* of placing the commerce and naviga- tion of their respective countries on the liberal basis of perfect equality and reciprocity, mutually agree, that the citizeus of each, may frequent all the coasts and countries of the other, and reside and trade there, in all kinds of produce, menufactures and merchandise; and they shall enjoy all the rights, privileges and ex- emptions, in navigation and commerce, which native citizens do, or shall enjoy, submitting themselves to the laws, decrees and usages there established, to which native citizens are subjected: but it is understood, that this article does not include the coasting trade of either countzy, the regulation of which is reserved by the parties respectively, according to their own separate laws. And it is further agreed, that this article shall be subject to the following modification. That whereas by a law of Ecuador of March 21st, 1837, vessels built in the dock-yard of Guayaquil, shall be exempted from various charges, therefore, vessels of the United States connot claim this privilege, but shall enjoy it if it should be granted to vessels belonging to Spain, or to Mexico and to the other Hispano -American Republices. Art. IV. They likewise agree, that whatever kind of Vroduce, manufactures or merchandise of any foreign country can be, from time to time, lawfully imported into the United States, in their own vessels, mey be also imported in the 'vessels of the Republic of Ecua- dor; and that no higher or other duties upon the ton- nage of the vessel and her cargo, shall be levied and collected, whether the importation be made in the ves- sels of the one country or of the other: and, in like manner, that whatever kind of produce, manufactures or marchandise of any foreign country, can be, form time to time, lawfully imported into the Republic of Ecua- dor in its own vessels, may be also imported in ves- sels of the United States; and that no higher or other dulies upon the tonnage of the vessel and her cargo, shall be levied or collected, whether the importation be made in vessels of the one country or of the other. And they agree, that whatever may be lawfully expor-301 Traitd entre les Etats -unis 1839 de esportation 6 re-esportacion se haga en los buques de la Reptiblica del Ecuador 6 en los de los Estados Unidos.

And the same bounties, duties and drawbacks shall be allowed and collected, whether such exportation, or re exportation be made in vessels of the United States, or of the Republic of Ecuador. Art. V. For the better understanding of the prece- ding article, and taking into consideration, the actual state of the commercial marine of Ecuador, it has been stipulated and agreed, that all vessels belonging exclu- sively to a citizen or citizens of said Republic, and whose captain is also a citizen of the same, though the construction or the erew are, or may be foreign, shall be considered for all the objects of this treaty, as an Ecuadorian vessels. Art. VI. No higher. or other duties shall be impo- sed on the importation into the United States, of any articles, the produce or manufactures of the Republic of Ecuador; and no higher or other duties shall be im- posed on the importation into the Republic of Ecuador, of any articles the produce or manufactures of the United States, than are, or shall be payable on the like articles, being the produce or manufactures of any other foreign country; nor shall any higher or other duties or charges be imposed in either of the two countries, on the exporta- tion of any articles to the United States or to the Re- public of Ecuador, respectively, than such as are pa- gable on the exportation of the like articles to any other foreign country; nor shall any prohibition be im- posed on the exportation or importation of any articles the produce or manufactures of the United States or of the Republic of Ecuador to or from the territories of the United States, or to or from the territories of the Republic of Ecuador, which shall not equally ex- tend to all other nations. Art. VII. It is likewise agreed, that it shall be wholly free for all merchants, commanders of ships and other citizens of both countries, to manage themselves, their own business, in all the ports and places subject to the jurisdiction of each other, as well with respect to the consignment and sale of their goods and merchandise be wholesale and retail, as with respect to the loading, unloading zmnd sending of their ships; they being in all these cases to be treated as ci-303 Traitd entre un igual con las naciones mas vorecidas. a los impu- estos y contribuciones generales, establecidas por ley, 6 que por ella, se establecieren.

They shall be subject, however, to such general taxes and contributions, as are,or may be established by law. Art. VIII. The citizens of neither of the contrac- ting parties- shall be liable to any embargo, nor be detained with their vessels, cargoes, marchandises, or effects for any military expedition, nor for any public or private purpose whatever, without allowing to those interested , a sufficient indemnification. Art. IX. Wehenever the citizens of either of the contracting parties , shall be forced to seek refuge or asylum, in the rivers, bays, ports or dominions of the other, with their vessels whether merchant or of war, public or private, through stress of weather, pursuit of pirates or enemies, they shall be received and treated with humanity, giving to them all favor and protection for reparring their ships, procuring provisions, and pla- cing themselves in a situation to continue their voyage, without obstacle or hindrance of any k d.Art. X. All the ships, merchandise, and the effects belonging, to the citizens, of one of the contracting parties, whiich may be captuied by pirates, whether within the limits of its jurisdiction or on the high seas, and may be carried or found in the rivers, roads, bays, ports or dominions of the other, shall be delivered up to the owners, they proving, in due and proper form, their rights, before the competent tribunals; it being well understood, that the claim should be made within the term of one year: bi the parties themselves, their attorneys, or agents of their respective Governments. Art. XI When any vessels belonging to the citi- zens of either of the contracting parties shall be wre- cked foundered, or shall suffer any damage on the coasts or within the dominions of the other there shall be given to them all assistance and protection in the same manner which is usual and customary with the vessels of the nation where the damage happens, per- mitting them to unload the said vessel, if necessary of its merchandise and effects, without exacting for it, any duty, impost, or contribution whatever, unless they be destined for consumption.

Aft. XII. The citizens of each of the contracting 1839 parties shall have power to dispose of their personal goods within the jurisdiction of the other, by sale, do- nation testament or otherwise, and their representatives, being citizens of the other party, shall succeed to their said personal goods, whether by testament or ab intes- tato, and they may take possession thereof, either by themselves or by others acting for them, and dispose of the same at their will, paying such duties only, as the inhabitants of the country wherein the said goods are, shall be subject to pay in like cases. And if in the case of real estate, the said heirs would be prevented from entering into the possession of the inheritance on acount of their character of aliens, there shall be granted to them, the term of three years, to dispose of the same as they may think proper, and to withdraw the pro- ceeds without molestation, nor any other charges than those which are imposed by the laws of the country. Art. XIII. Both the contracting parties promise and engage, formally, to give their special protection to the persons and property of the citizens of each other, of all occupations, who may be in the territories subject to the other, transient or dwelling therein, lea- ving open and free to them, the tribunals of justice, for their judicial recourse, on the same terms which the natives or citizens of the country, in which they may be, for which they may employ, in defence of their rights, such advacates, solicitors, notaries, agents and factors as they judge proper, in all their trials at law; and such citizens or agents shall have free opportunity to be present at the decisions and sentences of the tribu- nals, in all cases which may concern them; and like- wise at the talsing of all examihations and evidence which may be exhibited on the said trials. Art. XIV. It is likewise agreed that the most per- fect and entire security of conscience may be enjoyed by the citizens of both the contracting parties, in the coun- tries subject to the jurisdiction of the one and the other without their being liable to be disturbed or molested on account of their religious belief, so long as they respect the laws and established usages of the country. Moreover, the bodies of the citizens of one of the con- tracting parties, who may die in the teritories of the U23 07 308 Traild y de los Estados Unidos de navegar con sus buques, con toda seguridad y libertad, de cualquier puerto ' las plazas 6 lugares de los que son 6 fueren en adelante enemigos cualquiera nes son y esento, todo lo cientes con- tratantes, aun 6 a bordo de libres el reconocen XVI.

Art. XV. It shall be lawful for the citicens of the Uni- ted States of America and of the Republic of Ecuador, to sail with their ships, with all manner of liberty and se- curity, no distirfction being made who are the proprie- tors of the marchandises laden thereon, from any port, to the, places of those who now are, or hereaster shall be, at enmity with either of the conitracting, parties. It shall likewise be lawful for the citizens aforesaid, to sail with their ships and merchandises before mentioned, and to trade with the same liberty and security from the places, ports, and havens of those who are enemies of both, or either party, without any opposition or dis- turbance whatsoever; not only directly from the places of the enemy before mentioned, to neutral places, but also from one place belonging to an enemy, to another place belonging to an enemy, whether they be under the jurisdiction of one power, or under several. And it is hereby stipulated, that free ships shall also give freedom to goods, and that every thing shall be deemed free and exempt, which shall be found on board the ships belonging to the citizens of either of the contrac- ting parties, although the whole lading, or any part thereof, should appertain to the enemies of either; contraband goods being always excepted. It is also agreed, in like manner, that the same liberty shall be extended to persons who are on board a free ship, with this effect, that, although they may be enemies to both, or either party, they are not to be taken out of that free ship, unless they are officers or soldiers, and in the actual service of the enemies: Provided however, and it is hereby agreed that the stipulations in this article contajned, declaring that the flag shall cover the property, shall be understood as applying to those powers only who recognise this principle; but, if either of the two contracting parties shall be at war with a third, and the other neutral, the flag of the neutral shall cover the property of enemies, whose Govern- ments acknowledge this principle, dnd not of others. Art. XVI. It is likewise.agreed that in the case where the neutral flog of one of the contracting parties309 Traitd -entre les otra parte no podran alegar que la ignoraban. Por el las demas mercaderias y effec- articulos a lugares ii blo-310 et la rdpubl. de l'Equateur. shall protect the property of the enemies of the other, 1839 by virtue of the above stipulations, it shall always be understood, that the neutral property found on board such enemys vessels shall be held and considered as enemy's property, and as such, shall be liable to de- tention and confiscation; except such property as was put on board such vessel before the declaration of war,or even afterward, if it were done without the know- ledge of it, but the contracting parties agree, that six months having elapsed after the declaration , their citi- zens sliati not plead ignorance thereof. On the con- trary; if the flag of the neutral does not protect the enemy's property, in that ease, the goods and mer- chandises of the neutral, embarked in such enemy's ship, shall be free. Art. XVII. This liberty of navigation and commerce, shall extend to all kinds of merchandise, excepting those only which are distinguished by the name of con- traband: and under this name of contraband or prohi- bited goods shall be comprehended: 1st. Cannons, mortars, spears, halberds, and grena- des; bombs, powder, matches, balls, and all other things belonging to the use of these arms. 2d. Bukklers, helmets, breastplates, coats of mail, in- fantry belts, and clothes made up'in military form, and for military use. 3d. Cavalry belts, and horses with their furniture. 4th. And generally, all kinds of arms and instruments of iron,, steel, braas, and copper, or of any other materials, manufactured, prepared, and formed ex- pressly to make war, by sea or land. Art. XVIII. All other merchandises and things, not comprehended in the articles of contraband explicitly enumerated and classified as above, shall be held and considered as free, and subjects of free and lawful commerce, so that they may be carried and transpor- ted in the freest manner, by the citizens of both the contracting parties, evee to places belonging to an enemy, excepting only those places, which are, at that time, besieged or blockaded: and to,avoid all doubt in this particular, it is declared that those places only are be- sieged or blockaded which are actually attacked by a311 Traite' entre les Etats-unis articulos tan y de tanto vohimen que no puedan ser recibidos juzgado y sentenciado una de las puerto feere alli despues la rdpubl. de l'Equateur. belligerant force capable of preventing the entry of 1839 a neutral. Art. XIX. The articles of contraband before enu- merated and classified, which may be found in a vessel bound for an enemy's port shall be subject to detention and confiscation, leaving free the rest of the cargo and the ship, that the owners may dispose of them as they may see proper. No vessel of either of the two nations shall be detained on the high seas, on account of having on board, articles of contraband, whenever the master, captain or surpercargo of said vessel, will deliver up the articles of contraband to the captor, unless the quan- tity of such articles be so great, or of so large a bulk, that they cannot be received on board the capturing ship without great inconvenience; but in this and in all other cases of just detention and confiscation, lea- ving free the rest of the cargo and the ship; that the owners may dispiose of therb as they may see proper. No vessel of either of the two nations shall be detai- ned on the high seas, on account of having on board, articles of contraband, whenever the master captain or supercargo of said vessel, will deliver up the articles of contraband to the capturing ship without great in- convenience; but in just detention, the vessel detained shall be sent to the nearest convenient and safe port, for trial and judgment according to law. Art. XX. And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or places belonging to an enemy, without nowing that the same is besieged, blockaded or invested, it is agreed that every vessel so circumstanced, may be turned away from such port or place, but shall notbe detained, nor shall any part of her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated; unless, after warning 'of such blockade or investment, from any officer com- imanding a vessel of the blockading forces, they shall again attempt to enter, but she shall be permitted to go to any other port or place, she shall think proper. Nor shall any vessel of either, that may have ente- red into such port before the same was actually besieged blockaded or invested by the other, be restrained from quitting such place with her cargo; nor, if found ther- cin, after the reduction and surrender, shall such ves-313 Traitd entre y buque de guerra pii- blico 6 particular se encontrase con otra parte contratante, el permanecerd menor 6 espresaniente, que en ningun caso se ecsigir4 a neutral que vaya ' bordo del buque ecsaminador con relativos 4 la pro- piedad de los buques pertenecientes los ciudadanos, de las dos partes contratantes, ban convenido y con- vienen que en caso que una ellas estuviere el y lugar de la residencia del maestre 6 comandante, a fin de que se vea que el buque real y verdaderamente pertenece a los ciudadanos de una las el salid el buque, para del proceden- cia de buque en la forma acostumbrada; puede ser decla- et la rdpubl. de l'Equatear. sel or her cargo be liable to confiscation, but they shall 1839 be restored to the owners thereof. Art. XXI. In order to prevent all kinds of disor- der, in the visiting and examination of the ships and cargoes of both the contracting parties, on the high seas, they have agreed, mutually, that, whenever a ves- sel of war, public or private, shall meet with a neu- tral of the cther contracting party, the first shall re- main out of cannon shot, and may send its boats, with two or three men only, in order to execute the said examination of the papers, concerning the ownership and cargo of the vessel, without causing the least ex- tortion, violence or ill treatment, for which, the com- manders of the said ?rmed ships, shall be responsible with their persons and property: for which purpose,the commanders of the said private armed vessels shall,before receiving their commissions, give sufficient secu- rity to answer for all the damages, they may commit; and it is expressly agreed, that the neutral party shall, in no case, be required to go on board the examiningvessel, for the purpose of exhibiting his papers, or for any other purpose whatever. Art. XXII. To avoid all kind of vexation and abuse, in the examination of the papers relating to the owners- hip of the vessels belonging to the citizens of the two contracting parties, they have agreed and do agree, that in case one of them should be engaged in war, the ships and vessels belonging to the citizens of the other, must be furnished with seatetters or passports, expressing the name, property, and bulk of the ships; as also, the name and place of habitation of the mus- ter and commander of said vessel, i'n order that it may thereby appear that said ship truly belongs to the ci- tizens of one of thq parties; they have likewise, agreed that such ships being laden, besides the said sealetters or passports, shall also be provided with certificates containing the several particulars of the cargo, and the place whence the ship sailed, so that it may be known whether any forbidden or contra band goods be on board the same; which certificates shall be made out by the officiers of the place whence the ship sailed, in the accustomed form: without such requisites, said ves- sels may be detained, to be adjudged by the competent tribunal, and may be declared legal prize, unless the315 dante del convoy, bajo sus palabra de honor, los buques que tomaran ellas. la otra parte, la sentencia decretd hard de decreto, los dicho enemigo con- esperarse, y que Dios dos partes se los comercian- tes en las costas y en los puertos de entram- has, y el termino de anno A los que habitan en el Los, ciuda- et la rdpubl. de l'Equateir. 317 said defect shall be proved to be owing to accident, 1839 and satisfied or supplied by testimony entrirely equivalent. Art. XXIII., It is further agreed that the stipula- tions obove expressed relative to the visiting and exa- mination of vessels, shall apply only to those which sail without convoy, and when said vessels shall be under convoy the verbal declaration of the commander of the convoy, on his word of honner, that the ves- sels under his protection belong to the nation whose flag lie carries;, and when they are bound to an ene- my's port, that they have no contraband goods on board, shall be sufficient. Art. XXIV. It is further agreed, that in all cases, the established courts for prize causes, in the country to which the prizes may be- conducted,- shall alone, take cognizance of them; and vhenever such tribun als, of either party, shall pronounce judgment against any vessel, or goods, or property claimed by the ;citizens, of the other party, the sentence or decree shall mention the reasons or motives, on which the same shall have been founded, and an authenticated copy of the sen- tence or decree, and of all the proceedings in the case, shall, if demanded, be delivered to the commander or agent of said vessel, without any delay, he paying the legal fees for the same. Art. XXV. Whenever one of the contracting par- ties shall be engaged in war with another state, no citizen of the other contracting party shall accept a commission or letter of marque, for the purpose of assisting or co-operating hostilely with the said enemy, against the said party so at war, under the pain of being considered as a pirate. Art. XXVI. If, by any fatality, which can not be expected, and which God forbid, the two contracting parties should be engaged in a war with each other they have agreed, and do agree, now for then, that there shall be allowed the term of six months to the merchants residing on the coasts and in the ports of each other, and the term of one -year to those who dwell in the interior, to arrange their business and transport their effects, wherever they please, giving to them, the safe-conduct necessury for it, -which may serve as a sufficient protection, until they arrive at the Traite' entre les Elats y dominios de la personal y pro- piedad, so contraidas por los indi- viduos de uno nacion con los individuos de la otra, ni las acciones a dineros que puedan tener mismos inmunidades y esenciones de que gozan 6 gaza- ren en lo venidero los de la naciones mas bien entendido, favor, inmunidad 6 la Repsiblica del Ecuador 6 Estados Uni- dos de America hecho extensivo los Art. y los E\u00a7tados Unidos da- ran en \" la navegacion los ciu- dadanos de una y otra, se convienen en recibir ad- mitir consoles en los pe- rogativas 6 inmunidades de consules vice-consules se- mejantes consules y vice-consules no conveniente.

The citizens of all other occupations, 1839 who may be established in the territories or deminions of the United States and the Republic of Ecuador, shall be respected, and maintained in the full enjoyment of their personal liberty and property, unless their particular conduct shall cause them to forfeit this protection, which, in consideration of humanity, the contracting parties engage to give them. Art. XXVII. Neither the debts due from individu- als of the one nation to the individuals of the other, nor shares, nor moneys which they may have in pu- blic funds, nor in public nor private banks, shall ever, in any event of war, or of national difference, be sequestered or confiscated. Art. XXVIII. Both the contracting parties being desirous of avoiding all inequality in relation tho their public communications and official intercourse, have agreed and do agree, to grant to the envoyes, minis- ters and other public agents, the same favors, immuni- ties and exemptions, which those of the most favored nation do or shall enjoy: it being understood, that wha- tever favors, immunities or privileges, the United Sta- tes of America or the Republic of Ecuador may find it proper to give to the ministers and other public agents of any other power shall, by the same act, be exten- ded to those of each of the contracting parties. Art. XXIX. To make more effectual the protection which the United States and the Republic of Ecuador shall afford in future, to the navigation and commerce of the citizens of each other, they agree to receive and admit consuls and vice-consuls, in all the ports open to foreign commerce, who shall enjoy in them, all the rights, prerogatives and immunities of the consuls and vice-consuls of the most favored nation; each contrac- ting party, however,, remaining at liberty to except those ports and places, in which the admission and residence of such consuls and vice-consuls, may not seem convenient. Art. XXX. In order that the consuls and vice-con- suls of the two contracting parties, may enjoy the rights prerogatives and immunities which belong to them by their public character, they shall, before entering on the exercise of their functions, exhibit their commission319 Traite entre les Etats cules escrito, por una presentation de los registros de los buques, rol de equipage iA otros prisiones \"a los buques 'a misma nacion.

No Master shall in any Case be autho- rized to transfer to another Master hip apprenticed Ne- gro without the especial and written Sanction of the Board; and if the Master shall leave the Country, or shall change his Residence to a Part of the Country beyond the Limits herein-before fixed for Persons ha- ving Apprentices, or if he shall become so reduced in his Circumstances as to be obliged to give up his Estab- lishnent, then and in any of these Cases he shall report the same to the Board, and shall bring his Apprentices, and deliver-them up to the said Board, by whom they shall be received, and afterwards apprenticed to another Master for the Remainder of the Period which such Apprentices may have to serve, and under the same Conditions as-those imposed upon the first Master; but in no Case shall the Master be allowed to deliver up his Apprentice to any other Authority than to the said Board, or to the Curator, under the Orders of the Board. If any Apprentice shall be guilty of Crimes which render him obnoxious to the Laws of the qountry, or shall be guilty of habitual Drunkenness, Insubordina- tion, wilful Carelessness, or Destruction of his Master's Property, the Master may in such Case bring him be- fore the Board of Superintendence, and upon Proof of the Facts the said Board shall have Power to cancel the Indentures. Art. XV. If an Apprentice should run away, his Master shall give immediate Information thereof to the Curator , who shall instantly proceed to a summary Investigation of the Fact, for the Information of the Board of Superintendence.

If an Apprentice should die, Notice thereof shall immediately be given to the Curator, in order that he, or One of his Assistants, may attend, for the Purpose of ascertaining that the deceased Negro was really and truly the Apprentice described as such in the Register. For this Purpose the Curator or his Assistant shall make such Inquiries as he may judge necessary, inter- rogating the Inhabitants of the House in which the Negro has died, the Neighbours or any other Persons, and shall take such other Means as he may judge neces- sary to enable him to ascertain the Truth, in order that the Burial of the Negro, which is to be at the Expence of the Master, may take place without further Delay. A summary Report of the Result of this Inquiry shall then be drawn up officially by the Curator, and be delivered without Delay to the Board. The Curator, after having identified the Body of any Apprentice who may have died, shall investigate the Cause of the Death, and if the Death shall appear to have been natural he shall note that Fact in the Register. If the Cause of Death be doubtful, or shall appear to be otherwise than natural , he shall interrogate the other Negroes and other Inhabitans of the House, and take such' other Means as may 'appear necessary to as- certain the Facts of the Case; and if there shall appear Reason to suspect that the Death of *such Negro has been occasioned by Violence, improper Usage, or culpable Neglect, lie shall take the proper Course for bringing the Offender to Trial before the Courts of the Country. Art. XVIl. If the Master of any Apprentice shall commit any Breach of these Conditions, a Fine shall be imfposed upon him of not less than Fifty and not ex- ceeding One hundred Dollars, one Half of which shall go to the Informer, and the other Half shall be placed at the Disposal of the Board of Superintendence, for the Purposes herein-after mentioned; and in case of any gross Misconduct of the said Master towards his Apprentice, such Master shall, if the Board of Super- intendence shall think fit, besides paying the above- mentioned Fine, forfeit all further Right to the Servi- ces of the Apprentice, and the said Apprentice shall be taken from such Master, and shall be apprenticed to 380 Traitd entre la Grande- temps qui manque 'a son apprentissage.

The Board shall thereupon issue its Order to the Curator to bring the Apprentice before them; and when the Apprentice is so brought the Board shall apprentice him to another Master, under the established Conditions. If the Heir, or the Person in possession of such Apprentice, shall neglect to report the Death of the Master within Four Days, he .shall pay One Dollar a Day for each apprenticed Negro belonging to'suchi de- ceased Master until lie shall have delivered them all up to the said Board, and he shall, moreover, be subject to the other Penalties which attach to the Nonperform- ance of the Conditions established by these Regulations.

The Government in whose Service the Negroes enlist shall sign a Receipt for them , which Receipt shall be delivered to the Curator at the Time of the Enlistment, and the Board shall take Means to ensure that the full and permanent Liberation of -such Negroes shall be se- cured to. them, under the Principle contemplated by these Regulations.

The Curator shall endeavour by means of an Interpreter to explain to each Negrn the Nature of any Contract by which he may become bound, and shall inform him that if lie should at any Time be ill- treated by his Master lie must make his Complaint to the Curator, or to the Board of Superintendence of li- berated Negroes. Art. XXIIl. It shall be the Duty of the Curator or of his Assistants to visit once at least in every Three Months all Places where there are any liberated Negroes under the Superintendence of the Board. He shall exa- mine and inspect all such Negroes, receive their Com- plaints, inquire into them, and search out the Truth, and investigate any Abuses that may affect the said Negroes, and also inquire into the general Conduct of the Negroes, themselves. The Curator shall then bring to the Notice of the Board every Complaint on the'Part of the said Negroes, and every Breach committed of the Conditions and Sti- pulations of the Contracts under which the Negroes serve; and in all Cases of well-founded Complaint the Board shall take proper Means for affording Redress. The Inspections above prescribed are not to be made at stated Periods, but at uncertain Times, and unexpectedly. The Curator shall also report every Three Months to the Board the State in which lie finds the liberated Negroes, and such Reports shall be entered in a Book to be kept for that Purpose, to be called \"Curator's Re- ports,\" and to be deposited in the Office of the Board, 384 Traitd entre negres recevra les sommes qui devront les mattres, et it rendra compte du tout ' la surintendance.

Art. I. In consequence of the Oriental Government of the Uruguay not possessing at the present Period more Ships of War than are sufficient for the Protec- tion of the Coasts of the Republic, it is agreed that 392 Traitd entre la Grande-Bretagne 1839 pens~e, pendant dix ans a moins qu'elle ne juge convenable de le faire.

Art. II. It is agreed and understood, that if there should be any Delay in appointing the Judge and Arbi- trator to be nominated on the Part of the Republic of the Uruguay to act in each of the Mixed Courts of Justice to be established under this Treaty, or if those Officers, after having been appointed, should at any Time be absent, then and in either of such Cases the Judge and Arbitrator who shall have been appointed on the Part of Her Britannic Majesty, and who shall be present in the said Courts, shall, in the Absence of the Oriental Judge and Arbitrator, proceed to open the said Courts, and to adjudge such Cases as may be brought before them under the Treaty; and the Sen- tence pronounced upon such Cases by the said British Judge and Arbitrator shall have the same Force and Validity as if the Judge and the Arbitrator on the Part of the Oriental Republic had been appointed, and had been present and acting in the Mixed Courts in the Cases in question. Art. III. It is also agreed, notwithstanding the Pro- visions of the Second Article of the Annex (B.), that so long as no Oriental Judge and Arbitrator shall have been nominated it will be unnecessary for the Oriental Republic to nominate the Secretary or Actuary men- tioned in the said Article; that in the meanwhile the Secretary or Actuary of that Court which may exist within the Territory of the Oriental Republic shall be named and paid by the Government of Her Britannic Majesty, and that the entire Expence of both the Courts to be established under this Treaty shall be borne by the Government of Her Britannic Majesty. Art. 1V. If, in the Translation of the present Treaty into the Spanish Language an-y Mistake or Error should be committed, the English Text is to be adhered to.

IV. of this Treaty, there shall be established, within the Space of One Year at farthest from the Exchange of the Ratifications of the present Treaty, Two Mixed Courts of Justice, formed of an equal Number of In- dividuals of the Two Nations named for this Purpose by the Governments of the Two High Contracting Par- ties respectively. These Courts shall reside, one in a Possessionl be- longing to Her Britannic Majesty, the other within the Territories of the Republic of Bolivia; and the Two Governments, at the Period of the Exchange of the Ratifications of the present Treaty, shall declare, each for its 6wn Territories, in what Places the Courts shall respectively reside; each of the Two High Con- tracting Parties reserving to itself the Right of chan- ging at its Pleasure the Place of Residence of the Court held within its own Territories: Provided, however, that one of the Two Courts shall always be held upon the Coast of Africa, and the other in one of the Pos- session of the Republic of Bolivia. These Courts shall judge the Causes submitted to them according to the Provisions of the present Treaty, without Appeal, and according to the Regulations and Instructions which are annexed to the present Treaty, and which are considered as forming an integral Part thereof.

Hatches whith open Gratings, instead of the close Hatches which are usual in Merchant Vessels. Secondly. Divisions or Bulkheads in the Hold, or on Deck, in a greater Number than are necessary for Vessel engaged- in lawful Trade. Thirdly. Spare Plank fitted for being laid down as a Second or Slave Deck. Fourthly. Shackles, Bqlts, or Handcuffs. Fifthly. A larger Quantity of Water in Casks or in Tanks than is requisite for the Consumption of the Crew of the Vessel as a Merchant Vessel. Sixthly.

Art. XI. It is hereby agreed between the Two High Contracting Parties, that in all Cases in which a Vessel shall be detained under this Treaty by their respective Cruisers, as having been engaged in the Slave Trade, or as having been fitted out for the Purposes thereof, and shall consequently be adjudged and con- demned by the Mixed Courtsof Justice to be established as aforesaid, the said Vessel shall, immediately after its Condemnation, be broken up entirely, and shall be sold in separate Paris after having been so broken up. 492 TraihW entre la Grande -Bretagne 1840 Art.

The Commander of any Ship belonging to the Navy of Her Britannic Majesty or of the Republic of Bolivia, which shall be furnished with these Instruc- tions, shall have a Right to visit, search, and detain any British or Bolivian Merchant Vessel which shall be actually engaged or which shall be suspected to be engaged in the Slave Trade, or to be fitted out for the Purposes thereof , or to have been engaged in the Traffic in Slaves during the Voyage in which she may be met with by such Ship of the British or Bolivian Navy; and such Commander shall thereupon bring or send such Merchant Vessel as soon -as possible for Judg- ment before that one of the Two Mixed Courts of Jus- tice, established in virtue of Art. VII. of the'said Treaty, which shall be the nearest to the Place of Detention, or which such Commander shall upon his own Respon- sibility think can be soonest reached from such Place. Art. II. Whenever a \\Ship of either of the said Navies, duly authorized as aforesaid, shall meet a Mer- chantman liable to be visited under the Provisions of the said Treaty, the Search shall be conducted in the mildest Manner, and with every Attention which ought to be observed between allied and friendly Nations; and the Search shall in all Cases be made by an Officer holding a Rank not lower than that of Lieutenant in the Navy of Great Britain or of the Republic of Bolivia respectively (unless the Command shall, by reason of Death or otherwise, be held by an Officer of inferior Rank), or by the Officer who at the Time shall be second in Command of the Ship by which such Search is made. Art. 111. The Commander of any Ship of the Two Navies, duly authorized as aforesaid, who may detain any Merchant Vessel in pursuance of the Tenor of the present Instructions, shall leave on board the Vessel so detained the Master, the Mate, or Boatswain, and Two or Three at least of the Crew thereof, the whole of the Slaves, if any, and all the Cargo. 494 Traitd entre la Grande- Bretagne 1840 The Captor shall at the Time of Detention draw up in Writing an authentic Declaration which shall exhibit the State in which he found the detained Vessel, such Declaration to be signed by himself, and to be given in or sent together with the captured Vessel to the Mixed Court of Justice before which such Vessel shall be carried or sent for Adjudication. He shall deliver to the Master of the detained Ves- sel a certified List of the Papers seized on board the same, as well as of the Number of Slaves found on board at the Moment of Detention. In the authenticated Declaration which the Captor is hereby required to make, as well as in the certified List of the Papers seized, he shall insert his own Name, the Name of the capturing Ship, the Latitude and Lon- gitude of the Place where the Detention shall have ta- ken place, and the Number of Slaves found on board the Vessel at the Time of the Detention. The Officer in charge of the Vessel detained shall, at the Time of his bringing the Vessel's Papers into the Mixed Court of Justice, deliver into the Court a Paper, signed by himself, and verified on Oath, stating any Changes which may have taken place in respect to the Vessel, her Crew, the Slaves (if any), and her Cargo, between the Period of her Detention and the Time of delivering in such Paper. Art. IV. The Slaves. shall not be disembarked till after the Vessel which contains them shall have arrived at the Place of Adjudication, in order that in the event of the Vessel not being adjudged legal Prize the Loss of the Proprietors may be more easily repaired; and even after the Slaves have arrived at such Place they are not to be landed without the Permission of the Mixed Court of Justice. But if urgent Reasons, deduced from the Length of the Voyage, from the State of Health of the Slaves,or from other Causes, should require that either the Whole or a Portion of the Negroes should be disem- barked before the Vessel can arrive at the Place at which one of the said Courts is established, the Com- mander of the capturing Ship may take upon himself the Responsibility of so disembarking the Negroes; pro- vided that such Necessity and the Causes thereof be stated in a Certificate in proper Form, and that this et la Rdpublique de Bolivia. Certificate be entered at the Time on the Log Book 1840 of the detained Vessel. The undersigned Plenipotentiaries have agreed, in conformity with the Art. XIII. of the Treaty signed by them on this Day, the Twenty-fifth of September of One thousand eight hundred and forty, that the preceding Instructions, consisting of Four Articles, shall be annexed to the said Treaty, and be considered as an integral Part thereof.

These Courts shall judge definitively, and without Appeal, all Questions which shall arise out of the Cap- ture and Detention of such Vessels. The Proceedings of these Courts shall take place with as little Delay as possible, and for this Purpose the Courts are required to decide each Case, as far as may be practicable, within the Space of Twenty Days, to be dated from the Day on which the detai- et la Rdpublique de Bolivia. ned Vessel shall have been brought into the Port where 1840 the deciding Court shall reside.

In the event of the Two Judges not agreeing as to the Sentence which they ought to pronounce, in any Case brought before them, either with respect to the Legality of the Detention, the Liability of the Vessel to Condemnation, or the Compensation to be allowed, or as to any other Question which may arise out of the said Capture, or if any Difference of Opinion should arise between them as to the Mode of Proceeding in the said, Court, they shall draw by Lot the Name of One of the Two Arbitrators appointed as aforesaid, which Arbitrator,'after having considered the Proceedings which have taken place, shall consult with the Two above- mentioned Judges, and the final Sentence or Decision shall be pronounced conformably to the Opinion of the Majority of the Three.

II. Whenever a Ship of either of the said Na- vies, duly authorized as aforesaid, shall meet a Mer- chantman liable to be visited under the Provisions of the said Treaty, the Search shall be conducted * in the mildest Manner, and with every Altention which ought to be observed between allied and friendly Nations; and the Search shall in all Cases be made by atn Offi- cer holding a Rank not lower than that of Lieutenant in the Navy of Great Britain or Chile respectively (unless the Command shall, by reason of Death or other- wise, be held by an Officer of inferior Rank,) or by the Officer who at the Time shall be second in Com- mand of the Ship by which such Search is made. Art. Ill. The Commander of any Ship of the Two Navies, duly authorized as aforesaid, who may detain any Merchant Vessel in pursuance of the Tenor of the present Instructions, shall leave on board the Vessel so detained the Master, the Mate, or Boatswain, and Two or Three at least of the Crew thereof, the whole of the Slaves (if any), and all the Cargo. The Captor shall at the Time of Detention draw up in Writing an authentic Declaration, w hich shall ex- hibit the State in which he-found the detained Vessel, such Declaration to be signed by himself, and to be given in or sent, together with the captured Vessel, to the Mixed Court of Justice before 'which such Ves- sel shall be carried or sent for Adjudication.

But if the urgent fleasous deduced from the Length of the Voyage, from the State of Health of the Slaves, or from other Causes, should require that either the Whole or a Portion of the Negroes should be disem- barked before the Vessel can arrive at the Place at which one of the said Courts is established , the Com- mander of the capturing Ship may take upon himself the Responsibility of so disembarking the Negroes; pro- vided that such Necessity and the Causes thereof be stated in a Certificate in proper Form , and that this Certificate be entered at the Time on the Log Book of the detained Vessel. The undersigned Plenipotentiaries have agreed, in conformity with Article XIII. of the Treaty signed ,by them on this Day, the Nineteenth of January One thousand eight hundred and thirty- nine, that the pre- ceding Instructions, consisting of Foui Articles,, shall be annexed to the said Treaty, and be considered as an integral Part thereof.

The Judges and the Arbitrators shall, before entering upon the Duties of their Office, respectively make Oath before the principal Magistrate of the Places in which such Courts respectively shall reside, that they will judge fairly and faithfully, that they will have no Preference either for the Claimants or the Captors, and that they will act in all their Decisions in pursu- ance of the Stipulations of the aforesaid Treaty. There shall be attached to each of such Courts a Secretary or Registrar , who shall be appointed by the Government of the Country within Territories of which such Court shall reside. Such Secretary or Registrar shall register all the Acts of such Court, and shall, be- fore he enters upon his Office, make Oath before the Court to which lie is appointed , that lie will conduct himself with due Respect for his Authority, and will act with Fidelity and Impartiality in all Matters relat- ing to his said Office. The Salary of the Secretary or Registrar of the Court to be established on the Coast of Africa shall be paid by Her Britannic Majesty, and that of the Secretary or Registrar of the Court to be established in the Possessions of the Republic of Chile shall be paid by the Government of that Republic.

If the detained Vessel shall be restored by the Sentence of the Court,. the Vessel and the Cargo, in the State-in which they shall then be found, shall forthwith be given up to the-Master, or to the Person- who represents him; and such Master or other Person may, before the same Court, claim to have a Valuation made, in order to ascertain the Amount of the Dama- ges to which lie shall be entitled. The Captor himself, and in his Default his Government, shall remain re- ponsible for the Damages which may definitively be pronounced to be due to the Master of such Vessel, or to the Owners of the Vessel of her Cargo.

I. The Slave Trade is declared by this Treaty to be totally and perpetually abolished in all Parts of the World on the Part of. the Mexican Republic, as are already Slavery in the Mexican Territory and the aforesaid Traffic in Slaves on the Part of Great Britain. Art. 11. The Government of Mexico engages to take, immediately after the Exchange of the Ratifications of the ,resent Treaty, and subsequently from Time to Time when it may be necessary, the most effectual Measures to prevent the Citizens of the Mexican Re- public from being concerned in the Slave Trade, and the Flag of the said Republic from being employed in any way in carrying on that Traffic, and binds itself specially to procure from the National Congress as soon as possible a penal Law by which the severest Punish- ment shall be imposed on all Citizens of the Republic who shall, under whatsoever Pretext, take any Part in the aforesaid Traffic in Slaves. Art. III. The Mexican Government engages to et la Rdpublique de Mexique. 561 propose in the National Congress a Law which shall 1841 declare to be Pirates all such Citizens of the Republic as may be engaged in the Slave Trade, as well as all such Individuals as may carry it on under the Natio- nal Flag; and Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and His Ex- cellency the President of the Republic mutually bind themselves to promulgate or propose in their respective Legislatures the most suitable Measures for immediately carrying into execution the Laws of Piracy, which are to be applicable to the said Traffic, in conformiiy with the legislative Enactments of each of the Two Countries with respect to the Vessels and Subjects .or Citizens of the Two Nations. Art. IV. In order to prevent completely all Infrin- gement of the Spirit of the present Treaty the Two High Contracting Parties mutually consent that the Ships of their respective Navies which shall be provided as herein-after mentioned with special Instructions for the Purpose, may search such Merchant Vessel of the Two Nations as may be suspected, on reasonable Grounds, of being engaged in the Traffic in Slaves, or of having been fitted out for the Purpose thereof, or of having, during the Voyage in which they may be met with by the said Cruisers, been engaged in the Traffic in Slaves, in contravention of the Stipulations of the present Treaty; and the Two Contracting Parties also agree that the said Cruisers may detain such Vessels, and send or convey them to be tried in the Manner herein -after provided. With a view to avoid even the Possibility of Annoy- ance to the Coasting Trade of Mexieo from the Exer- cise of the mutual Right of Search stipulated in the present Article, the High Contracting Parties agree that the said Right shall not be enforced within a Line drawn from the Mouth of the Rio Bravo del Norte, in Twenty- five Degrees Fifty-five Minutes of North Latitude, and Ninety-seven Degrees Twenty-five Mi- nutes of Longitude West from Greenwich, to the Port of Sisal in the Peninsula of Yucatam, in Twenty-one Degrees Six Minutes of North.

Tome IF. Nn 562 Traird entre la Grande-Bretagne 1841 discovered without the said Line by a British or Aex- ican Cruiser, and shall succeed in passing within that Line, it shall not on that Account be considered as protected by the present Restriction , which is solely adopted for the greater Security of the Coasting Trade of Mexico. Nor shall the reciprocal Right of Search be exercised in the Mediterranean Sea, nor in the Seas of Europe lying without the Straits of Gibraltar, and to the North of the Thirty -seventh Parellel of North Latitude, and to the Eastward of the Meridian of Twenty Degrees West of Greenwich. Art. V. In order to regulate the Mode of carrying into execution the Provisions of the preceding Article it is agreed, First. That their respective Governments shall pro- vide the Ships of the Navies of the Two Nations to be employed in future in the Prevention of the Slave Trade with Copies, in the English and Spanish Languages, of the present Treaty, of the Instructions for Cruisers annexed thereto, sub literd (A.), and of the Regula- tions for the Tribunals which shall have to try the Ves- sels detained by virtue of the Stipulations contained in this Treaty, which are also annexed, sub literd (B.), which Annexes respectively shall be considered as in- tegral Part of the said Treaty: Secondly. That each of the High Contracting Par- ties shall from Time to Time communicate to the other the Names of the several Ships destined for this Ser- vice, and furnished with such Instructions, the Force of each, and the Names of their Commanders. Thirdly. That when the Commander of a Cruiser of either of the Two Nations shall suspect that any One or more Vessel or Vessels navigating under the Escort or Convoy of a Ship of War of the other Na- tion carries Slaves on board, or has been engaged in this prohibited Traffic, or is fitted out for it, he shall communicate his Suspicions to the Commanding Officer of the Convoy, who, accompanied by the Commanding Officer of the Cruiser, shall proceed to the Search of the suspected Vessel; and in case that the Suspicions appear well founded according to the Tenor of this Treaty, then the said Vessel shall be conducted or sent et la R lpublique de Mexique. 563 to the Place where it is to be brought to Trial, in or- 1841 der that the just Sentence may there be pronounced. Fourthly. It is further agreed , that the Comman- ders of the Ships of the Two Navies who shall be em- ployed on this Service shall adhere in each Case to the exact Tenor of the said Instruction. Art. VI. As the Two preceding Articles are enti- rely reciprocal, the High Contracting Parties engage to make good any Losses incurred by their respective Sub- jects or Citizens by the arbitrary and illegal Detention of their Vessels, it being understood that this Compen- sation shall be paid invariably by the Government whose Cruiser shall have been guilty of such arbitrary and illegal Detention; and they also engage that the Visit and Detention of Vessels, specified in the Fourth Art. of this Treaty, shall only be effected by such English or Mexican Ships as may form Part of the Royal and National Navies of the High Contracting Parties, and which are provided with the Documents mentioned in the preceding Article. Art. VII.

For the more speedy Conclusion of these Trials, the High Contracting Parties engage to procure the Enact- ment of Laws which shall abridge as much as possible the Forms of Indictment and Sentence. Art. VIII. When the Commanding Officer of any of the Ships of the Navies of Her Britannic Majesty or of the Republic of .Mexico, commissioned respectively in due Form, according to the Provisions of the Fourth Article of this Treaty, shall deviate in any respect from the Stipulations of the said Treaty, or from the Instruc- tions annexed thereto, the Government which shall con- ceive itself wronged shall be entitled to demand Repar- ation, and in such Case the Government in whose Ser, vice the said Commanding Officer may be binds itself to cause an Inquiry to be made into the Subject of Complaint, and to inflict on such Officer a Punishment proportioned to the Offence. Art. IX.

Hatches with open Gratings , instead of the close Hatches which are usual in Merchant Vessels. Secondly. Divisions or Bulkheads in the Hold, or on Deck, in greater Number than are necessary for a Vessel' engaged in lawful Trade. Thirdly. Spare Plank prepared to be fitted up as a Second or Slave Deck. Fourthly. Shackles, Bolts, or Handcuffs. Fifthly. A Quantity. of Water in Casks or Tanks much greater than is requisite for the Consumption of the Crew of the Vessel as a Merchant Vessel. Sixthly. An extraordinary Number of Water Casks, or of other Vessels for holding Liquid, unless the Ma- et la Re'publique de llexique. 565 ster shall produce a Certificate from the Custom House 1S41 of the Port from which he cleared outwards , stating that the Owners of such Vessel had given sufficient Se- curity that such extra Quantity of Casks or of other Vessels should only be employed to receive Palm Oil,or for other Purposes of lawful Commerce. Seventhly. A greater Quantity of Mess Tubs than are requisite for the Use of the Crew of the Vessel as a Merchant Vessel. Eighthly. A Boiler of an unusual Size, and larger, than is requisite for the Use of the Crew of the Ves- sel as a Merchant Vessel, or more than One Boiler of the ordinary Size. Ninthly. An extraordinary Quantity of Rice, of Flour of Brazil, of Manioc, or Cassada commonly called Farina, of Maize, exceeding what might probably be consumed by the Crew, such Rize, Flour, or Maize not appearing to be entered on the Manifest as Part of the Cargo for Trade. Any One or more of these several Circumstances, if proved, shall be considered as Indications primd facie of the actual Employment of the Vessel in the Slave Trade, and will serve therefore to condemn and declare het- a lawful Prize, unless it be established by satisfactory Evidence on the Part of the Master or Owners that the Vessel at the Time of her Detention was, employed in some legal Pursuit. Art. X. If any of the Things specified in the pre- ceding Article shall be found in any Merchant Vessel, no Compensation for Losses, Damages, or Expences resulting from the Detention of such Vessel shall be allowed either to her Master or to her Owner, or other Person interested in her Equipment or Lading, even though the Tribunal declare her acquitted. Art. XI. It is hereby agreed between the Two High Contracting Parties that in all Cases in which a Vessel shlall be detained, according to the Stipulations of this Treaty, by their respective Cruisers as having been en- gaged in the Slave Trade, or as having been flitted out for the Purpose thereof, and shall consequently be tried and condemned by the proper Tribunal, the said Vessel shall, immediately after her Condemnation, be broken up, and the separate Parts sold. Art. XII. Each of the High Contracting Parties so- 566 Traitd entre la Grande -Bretagne 1841 lemnly binds itself to guarantee the Liberty of the Ne- groes who may be emancipated and conducted to either of the Two Nations, by virtue of the Stipulations of this Treaty, from the Moment of their landing in their respective Territories, and to afford from Time to Time, when demanded by the other Party or by the respec- tive Tribunals, the fullest Information as to the State and Condition of such Negroes, with a view of insu- ring the due Execution of the Treaty in this respect. For this Purpose the Regulations annexed to this Treaty, sub literd (C.), as to the Treatment of such liberated Negroes, have been drawn up and declared an integral Part of the said Treaty. The High Contracting Parties reserve to themselves the Right of altering and suspending, by common Con- sent, but not otherwise, the Terms of the said Regu- lations. Art. XIII.

Instructions for the Ships of the British and Mexicqa Navies destined to prevent the Traffic in Slaves. (B.)- Reguldtions for the Tribunals which are to take cognizance of the Trials of the Vessels detained by virtue of the Stipulations of this Treaty. (C.)

II. To avoid even the Possibility of Prejudice re- sulting from the Ninth Article of Treaty of this Date to the Merchant Vessels which the Mexican Govern- ment may have occasion to employ in certain Cases for the Conveyance of Troops by Sea, or of Convicts from one Point of the Republic to another, it is agreed to except from the Operation of the Ninth Article the Mer- chant Vessels employed by the Mexican Government -in such Service; such Vessels shall not be liable to be detained, even if One or more of the Things mentioned in the aforesaid Article should be found on board, pro- vided they do not convey Negroes for the Slave Trade, and that the Captain of the Vessel on board which the prohibited Articles or Effects are found produce a Do- cument, signed by any competent Authority of the Re- public, stating the Service on which such Vessel is em- ployed; but such Document must not be of a Date 1so remote that it may be believed, on reasonable Grounds, to have been issued for another Voyage anterior to that on which such Vessel has been met with.
