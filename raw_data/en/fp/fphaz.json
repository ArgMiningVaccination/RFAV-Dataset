While discoveries on the campuses have been stellar, the University, through UM Innovation, has been taking giant steps to boost research capacity - a 2 million square-foot Life Science Park planned near the medical school - and reach out to outside investors and industries that can help transfer promising technologies from the research bench to the marketplace. To that end, UM Innovation held UM Innovation Technology Showcase 2008, its first, on December 2-3 at the Four Seasons Miami. While the second day was devoted to highlighting particular medical breakthroughs and scientific discoveries and those in development stages, the first day saw the launch of UM Innovation's Corporate Advisory Council at a meeting hosted by Bart Chernow, M.D., vice provost for technology advancement at UM. Chernow welcomed the council members, an impressive group of executives from medicine and industry, intellectual property law and other areas, and members of UM leadership and faculty. The council, Chernow said, was created to \"establish a strong relationship between the University and corporate America - one that advances the ability of UM to achieve its vision and mission.\" For more on this story, [click here](http://www.med.miami.edu/).

On the information side, library users will be pleased to discover improvements to the already great research offerings with the addition of some of the latest research and organizational databases. On Friday, Dean Pascal J. Goldschmidt, M.D., hosted a catered reception to celebrate the upgraded library. With members of the medical school's faculty and leadership on hand, along with staff and visitors, Goldschmidt congratulated Calder Library executive director Mary Moore, Ph.D., and her staff for the time and work they put in on the renewal project (pictured at left, Dean Goldschmidt and Dr. Moore at the open house.) \"We're here to celebrate what has been an outstanding and breathtaking transformation,\" Goldschmidt said. \"This is what you want when you are looking for a great center of knowledge and information. Everything students, staff and faculty need to assist with their research can be found right here. This is what Mary said she would do and she and her staff have succeeded.\" Goldschmidt pointed out the library's dedication to provide resources to support evidence-based medicine. Representatives from several medical research database firms demonstrated software systems designed to make evidence-based and other research fast and easily accessible. Demonstrations were given of the QUOSA, Isabel, Scopus, Collexis and UpToDate, a system now available at University of Miami Hospital. Dr. Moore lauded Dean Goldschmidt for his commitment, thanked her staff, and promised there were more improvements to come. \"This is just the tip of the iceberg,\" Moore remarked. \"We intend to bring you more incredible services that can revolutionize your scholarly research.\" Visitors to the Louis Calder Memorial Library will notice the aesthetic changes - the new centrally located circulation desk built like a ship's prow, new interior design elements that allow daylight to flood the building, and upgraded workstations.

The human genome has hidden levels of regulatory complexity and variability that have begun to reveal themselves since the initial sequence became available in 2001. Today, with increasingly powerful sequencing and analysis technologies, we are not only beginning to appreciate the scale of variation in individual human genome sequences, but also gaining a greater understanding of how genome differences relate to human evolution and disease. This meeting will showcase these advances in our understanding of human genome regulation and variability as well as the potential of new technologies to drive the advancement of knowledge. This year's keynote speakers and awardees are Svaante Paabo from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany; Craig Venter, Ph.D., founder, chairman and president of the J. Craig Venter Institute; and George Church, Ph.D., professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.

Join us at the 42nd Miami Winter Symposium on January 24 through 28 at Deauville Beach Resort in Miami Beach. The human genome has hidden levels of regulatory complexity and variability that have begun to reveal themselves since the initial sequence became available in 2001. Today, with increasingly powerful sequencing and analysis technologies, we are not only beginning to appreciate the scale of variation in individual human genome sequences, but also gaining a greater understanding of how genome differences relate to human evolution and disease. This meeting will showcase these advances in our understanding of human genome regulation and variability as well as the potential of new technologies to drive the advancement of knowledge. This year's keynote speakers and awardees are Svaante Paabo from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany; Craig Venter, Ph.D., founder, chairman and president of the J. Craig Venter Institute; and George Church, Ph.D., professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.

Tai Chi for Health and Smoking Cessation Tai Chi engages all of your senses during the exercises, so you don't have time to notice that you want a cigarette. The conscious breath in Tai Chi practice is also known to help regulate the respiratory system and lessen the severity of asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis; all of which can afflict smokers. The course will focus on improving muscular strength and flexibility, heart and lung capacity, posture, balance, and the integration of mind and body. If you qualify for this study, you will be assigned to a group of 8-12 people to participate in the Tai Chi exercise program three times per week for 12 weeks at the UM Medical Wellness Center. Classes are one hour long and will start the beginning of January. After the initial 12 weeks, you will also participate in a session once per week for the next 12 weeks. Master trainer Jef Morris will lead the Tai Chi course. Jef has been featured in articles in the Miami Herald and New York Times. The course cost is $84, which is the same cost as participating in the existing UM smoking cessation program. Upon successful completion of the program, Benefits Administration will reimburse the full amount to you if you are a UM employee. If you are not a UM Employee, then you will not be reimbursed for participating in the study.
