Thanks to two agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration in just the last 11 months, they can now receive more personalized and e ective treatment. Further studies, however, are required to determine why the mutations can be so unrelenting, as one patient experienced a/f_t er some time on the drug. We also talked with two other patients about how they have benefited from vigilance and strict adherence to screening schedules that can detect recurrence and metastases. They show us the importance of follow-up throughout the cancer journey, even during survivorship. Also in this issue, as part of CURE\u00ae's 20th anniversary series, a cancer center director highlights the advances in biomarker testing in patients with lung cancer, which has also opened the doors to further development of e ective treatments. She highlights the progress that has been made during the past 20 years and outlines what needs to be accomplished in the next 20 years to make it a more e ective target. \"There's real potential to be able to manage lung cancer in the future with fewer deaths than we have now, even though we are doing much better than we did back in 2002, \" Joann Sweasy, director of the University of Arizona Cancer Center in Tucson, said in an interview. Other topics addressed in this special issue are exercises for at-home recovery a/f_t er lobectomy, surgical treatment decision-making in early-stage lung cancer and the e ect that a delayed diagnosis can have on patients.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recom- mend that certain populations be screened for lung cancer with low-dose CT scans. But what happens once a patient has been diagnosed? Does screening continue after treatment is completed and survivorship status is determined? In this issue of CURE\u00ae, we learn how critical it is to continue having follow-up exams and tests, every month or so until disease progression has been controlled and perhaps less frequently thereafter. Patients who have been treated for lung cancer are at risk not only for recurrence due to residual microscopic cancer cells, but also for completely new, indepen- dent cancers of the lung and other areas. Follow-ups give oncologists the oppor- tunity to check whether new nodules have developed or disease has spread. A regular screening schedule after a diagnosis is important because if cancer is detected, care teams can act quickly and hopefully obtain positive outcomes. Optimal surveillance guidelines, for both health care professionals and patients, are continually updated and available on websites like those of the American Cancer Society (cancer.org) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (asco.org). Even with high-tech methods to identify lung cancer recurrence, there is no fool- proof way to predict whether the disease will come back. This would be especially helpful for patients with small cell lung cancer, which is more likely than others to spread. Once a recurrence has been identified on imaging tests, a multidisci- plinary approach can help patients and their families understand the pattern of recurrence and lead to better treatment moving forward. In addition, a new lung or other cancer (not a recurrence of the original cancer) can develop years later, which may be curable with resection and/or other therapies. Although smoking sometimes plays a role in a patient's increased risk for lung cancer \u2014 and cessation does, over time, lower the risk of certain secondary cancers \u2014 factors like genetic predis- positions and air pollution may also contribute to this higher risk. Even so, patients can reduce the risk by making healthy choices with respect to diet and physical activity.

Back then, not much was known about the molecular basis of lung cancer, and thus there were no targeted agents with which to treat it. Today, biomarkers are a mainstay in determining the most beneficial approach. In honor of its 20th anniversary, CURE \u00ae spoke with Joann Sweasy, director of the University of Arizona Cancer Center in Tucson, to learn more about how far the study of biomarkers has advanced and where it may be headed. \"We've come amazingly far, \" she said. \"It's a game changer what we're doing right now. We are so ahead of where we were in 2002, it's amazing. \" WHAT ARE BIOMARKERS? Technically, biomarkers are mutations \u2014 similar to typos \u2014 in DNA. These typos can be big, small or even a rearrange-ment in the DNA sequence. \"The mutation, they profile a number of different genes,\" Sweasy explained. \"These genes encode proteins, and essentially, what happens is (that) these mutant or altered proteins ... make every single cell survive, and the cancer cells survive. That's what they're about, promoting survival. \" Testing for biomarkers is performed primarily via biopsy, although it can also be done by bronchoscopy (a procedure that allows doctors to look at a patient's airways and lungs) or by testing sputum (saliva and mucus from the respiratory tract). Although it is standard at National Cancer Institute-designated centers, patients should inquire about the testing regardless of where they receive their diagnosis and treatment, Sweasy advised. \"I would ask, 'How are you really going to diagnose (lung cancer)? And are you going to profile the genomics and look for genetic changes in my cancer?'\" Sweasy explained. FROM BIOMARKERS TO THERAPEUTICS Progress has been made because researchers have come to understand the three-dimensional structure of the proteins involved. By comparing normal and mutant proteins, they can see where the change has occurred and use that information to design drugs that target the mutation, Sweasy said. The challenge now is to understand why tumors become resistant to targeted therapies over time.\"The goal of the cancer (cells) is to survive, \" Sweasy said. \"As that cancer proliferates and proliferates, more and more mutations are arising, so that's where the resistance comes in. A targeted therapy is provided; you can be on that therapy and doing well for quite a while and then, all of a sudden, the tumor becomes resistant. That's where we really need to get better these days. \" UNMET NEEDS AND FUTURE RESEARCH In addition, more research is required to detect biomarkers for other types of cancer. Further investigation is needed to determine which biomarkers are actionable for small cell lung cancer, which is often associated with cigarette smoking. Smoke itself can cause mutations in the tumor. \"People with lung tumors with lots and lots of mutations generally respond to immunotherapy, but not all the time, \" Sweasy said. \"And some people who don't have high levels of mutations in their tumors respond. We need to figure that out, too. \" Although biomarker testing is becoming a bigger part of a patient's care journey, not every patient has access to these tests. Social determinants of health and rural disparities make it more difficult for certain individuals to access these tests, and insurance does not cover them in all circumstances, Sweasy noted. Despite unmet needs in this area, the progress that has been made offers patients more effective treatments and allows them to learn more about the disease. \"I think the field continues to grow, \" Sweasy said. \"There's real potential to be able to manage lung cancer in the future with fewer deaths than we have now, even though we are doing much better than we did back in 2002. \" TASTY_CAT / STOCK.ADOBE.COMTREATABLE BIOMARKERS According to th e American Lung As sociation, the Food and Drug Admin istration has ap proved treatments for lung cancer f or the following biomarkers: EGFR mutation ROS1 gene rearrangement ALK gene rearrangement NTRK fusion BRAF V600E mutation RET gene rearrangements MET amplification or MET exon 14 skipping PD-L1 level Identifying genetic mutations has allowed researchers to develop treatments that target specific biomarkers over the past 20 years, but more research is needed to further the space. By DARLENE DOBKOWSKI, MABiomarker Testing Provides 'Real \u00b7 11.22PATIENTS WITH NON-SMALL cell lung cancer who undergo surgical removal of a pulmonary lobe must exercise to avoid such complications as collapse of the unaffected lung and the pooling of secretions that may obstruct air passages if not cleared by coughing due to postoperative pain. Light exercises, which can be done at home, may also be beneficial for patients who require additional therapy like chemotherapy or radiation because exercise helps reduce the toxicities that can occur with these treatments. To learn more about these exercises, CURE\u00ae spoke with Dr. Scott L. Shofer, a pulmonologist at Duke Cancer Center in North Carolina and Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and Susan Blackwell, a physician assistant in the thoracic oncology program at Duke Cancer Center. Both suggest that patients speak with their cancer team before starting to exercise.heal at home RESISTANCE BANDS These elastic bands, which come in different levels of resistance, can be used to do arm curls, leg lifts and other exercises. \"Start with (a band) that allows you to complete eight to 10 repetitions of a particular exercise, and aim for three sets of eight to 10 repetitions, \" Shofer said. \"Increase band resistance as you become more accustomed to the exercise. \" levels of resistance, can be used to do arm curls, \"Start with (a band) that allows you to complete and aim for three sets of eight to 10 repetitions, \" BREATHING EXERCISES An incentive spirometer is often given to patients at the hospital, which can be taken home for further use. \"It has a volume measurement ... (that shows) how big the breath is on inhalation, \" Shofer explained. \"(Patients) can continue to work on getting (the volume) higher and higher to a defined target level. \" Stay adherent to respiratory medications to help clear secretions, open airways and lead to more effective breathing. Patients may be pushing themselves too hard if they feel lightheaded, sweaty or clammy, or if they feel like they can't catch their breath. If a patient experiences these feelings, find a place to sit and rest until these symptoms resolve. If they don't go away after several minutes, consult with a doctor or get emergency attention before restarting an exercise program.Improving BreathingImproving BreathingADVICECHAIR EXERCISES Patients can work on movements from sitting to standing, which allows them to move in a controlled manner. \"(For a patient who is) early post-op, (if they) want to start moving a little bit but (they're) not quite ready to get into a (rehabilitation) program, things we often do are things like sit to stand (exercises), working from the chair, \" Shofer said. WALKING Patients can walk outdoors on flat ground (tracking how much they walk with a pedometer) or on a treadmill. A pulse oximeter, which measures blood oxygen saturation and estimates heart rate, can allow patients to gauge how much more they can exercise. \"(Patients) can probably think about working in a level of intensity that's maybe 20% above their baseline heart rate, \" Shofer said. \"If their normal heart rate is in the 80s or 90s, and they're exercising up to the 110s or 120s, that's a reasonable level of exercise for people to start with. \" Blackwell added, \"I tell patients to start out slow so they don't get overwhelmed and they don't quit. ... I do not want them to get discouraged and stop exercising. \"FOR EVERY PERSON. ON EVERY FRONT. EVERY DAY. Lung cancer does not discriminate, and access to quality healthcare shouldn't either.

When she woke up the next morning, she felt pressure in her chest. \"I figured I overdid it with the garden work,\" she says. But her symptoms didn't subside. They got worse. As the day went on, she felt overwhelmingly tired, was unable to go up the stairs without becoming winded and began struggling to breathe. Concerned, her husband, Ralph, took her to the emergency room that evening. \" After 11 hours of waiting and tests, the doctor told me I had a buildup of fluid in the space around my heart and I needed immediate surgery,\" Muller recalls. Four days later, she learned she had stage 4 lung cancer. New treatments may stall lung cancer progression in patients with EGFR exon 20 Typos FOR RACHEL CAPIL 12_CURELung2_Feature_EGFR_1122.indd \u00b7 11.22Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of those deaths. In recent years, immu- notherapy drugs have dramatically extended the lives of patients with advanced lung cancer, so Muller's oncolo- gist was optimistic. He ordered comprehensive genetic testing called next-generation sequencing (NGS). With this kind of sequencing, doctors can detect 4 million variants, some of which can be targeted with treatment. \"My doctor wanted to put me on an immunotherapy drug called Keytruda (pembrolizumab) right away, even before the (next-generation sequencing) results came back, followed by several cycles of two chemotherapy drugs,\" she says. But when Muller realized that starting the treatment regimen would prevent her from participating in a clinical trial, she transferred her care to Stanford. By then, she had the NGS results, which indicated that her cancer was driven by a rare mutation called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion, which is often described as an \"undruggable\" target in the lung cancer world. For the 1% to 2% of patients with NSCLC who have these mutations, immunotherapy agents offer limited benefit and can even cause additional harm. RACHEL CAPIL RENATA MULLER's husband, RALPH, has been by her side since he took her to the hospital when her shortness of breath worsened aft er working in her garden. 12_CURELung2_Feature_EGFR_1122.indd 1412_CURELung2_Feature_EGFR_1122.indd 14 10/31/22 10:17 PM10/31/22 10:17 PM 15 COVER STORY genetic mutations Muller's decision to transfer care opened the door for her to partici - pate in a clinical trial investigating an agent that specifically targets approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2021. Six months earlier, the agency had approved another drug targeting the same mutations, a bispecific antibody called Rybrevant (amivantamab). \"For the first time, we have options that target these rare genetic muta - tions, and that's a game changer for patients,\" says Dr. Estelamari Rodriguez, a thoracic oncologist and clinical research lead of the Thoracic Site Disease Group at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami. \"In the past, after patients failed chemotherapy, we didn't have much to offer. ... Now we have these new targeted therapies that are currently used for what doctors call 'salvage therapy,' after patients don't respond to chemotherapy.\" The drugs are the first FDA- approved treatments to specifi - cally target EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, but several more are in the pipeline, and they may buy patients more time so that science can effectively catch up to them. EGFR MUTATIONS EXPLAINED EGFR is a protein in cells known as a growth factor receptor, which helps them grow. Some mutations in the EGFR gene can activate the receptor and lead to uncontrolled cell growth, thus leading to or accelerating cancer. With NGS, doctors can uncover the changes in the DNA that might be fueling (driving) cancer. In NSCLC, EGFR mutations are one of those oncogenic drivers. Think of DNA as an instruction manual. If there's a typo in the manual, cells receive incomplete or incorrect instructions and may become cancerous. Doctors look for those typos to determine whether a patient is a candidate for therapies that target them specifically. Besides misspelled words (point mutations), there may be other mistakes, like missing words (deletions) and added words (insertions). EGFR mutations include all three. Mutations in exon 19 and exon 21, which are often referred to as \"clas - sical\" EGFR mutations, account for about 85% of EGFR mutations in NSCLC. Doctors treat them with drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which block the action of enzymes that preferentially signal cancer cells to divide and grow. Up to 80% of patients with classical EGFR mutations respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which can keep the cancer at bay for an average of 19 months \u2014 and much longer for a subset of patients. \"Unfortunately, the treatments we use for classical EGFR mutations aren't effective in patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions,\" says Dr. John V . Heymach, chair of thoracic/head and neck medical oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The additional insertions in these muta - tions cause defects in the drug- binding pocket, reducing sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. That's why it's important for patients with lung cancer to charac - terize their disease before beginning treatment. For NGS, doctors place tumor tissue in a machine that can rapidly sequence the tumor's DNA and identify a large number of biomarkers all at once. If patients can't undergo a traditional biopsy for NGS, doctors may use a liquid biopsy to search for the biomarkers by analyzing tumor DNA in the bloodstream. \"PCR (polymerase chain reac - tion) testing is not sufficient to pick up certain mutations, including EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations,\" Rodriguez says. \"So it's extremely important for patients to get NGS or a liquid biopsy upfront, so they can take advantage of new treatments that can extend their lives.\" Experts say that NGS should be standard of care following a diagnosis for all patients with lung cancer because treatments vary depending on the mutations they have. According to some estimates, however, only half of patients know this critical informa - tion when they begin treatment. NOVEL TREATMENT OPTIONS Many patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have never smoked, so they're not flagged for lung cancer screening. By the time they develop symptoms, they have advanced disease and surgery is no longer an option. And radiation won't work because the cancer has spread throughout the body and there are too many targets to treat. That leaves two options: cutting off the fuel that is driving the cancer and/or killing the cancer cells. Doctors typically start with tradi - tional platinum-based chemotherapy, but in patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, chemotherapy shrinks tumors by only 20% to 25%, which may provide patients six months on average, according to Heymach. Now, however, doctors have two additional treatments. RYBREVANT Delivered by infusion every two weeks, Rybrevant targets both EGFR and an oncogene called MET. Instead of disabling the ATP-binding kinase activity of EGFR, as tyrosine kinase inhibitors do, the antibodies in Rybrevant go after the EGFR protein on the cell surface to disable the receptor and allow the body's natural killer cells to attack the cancer. Studies show a response rate of up to 40% with Rybrevant, and a median progression-free survival (the length of time during and after treatment when a patient with cancer lives without disease worsening) of seven months. Approximately 65% of patients have \u00b7 11.22an infusion reaction, which may include becoming flushed, feverish and short of breath, so the first infusion is often deliv- ered very slowly, says Dr. Jyoti D. Patel, medical director of thoracic oncology and assistant director for clinical research at the Lurie Cancer Center of Northwestern University in Chicago. Most patients have a reaction only to the first or second infusion. Other side effects include rash (86%), paronychia, an infection of the nail bed (45%), and diarrhea (12%). EXKIVITY Exkivity is active against both EGFR and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). A capsule taken orally, Exkivity is specially designed to accommodate the narrow binding pocket of the EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation. \"It attaches to the internal part of the EGFR receptor, interrupting signaling from the receptor downstream,\" says Dr. Lyudmila A. Bazhenova, a medical oncologist at Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego. The response rate with Exkivity hovers around 28%, and the median progression-free survival is seven months. Its side effects are similar to Rybrevant's but more pervasive, with up to 82% of patients experi- encing diarrhea, 46% rash and 39% nausea and vomiting. There hasn't been a head-to-head study comparing the safety and effi- cacy of these drugs, so doctors aren't sure which works best. But they know that both eventually stop working. \"Patients can develop secondary mutations that prevent the medica- tions from binding appropriately, or the cancer becomes more resistant and learns to bypass EGFR,\" Heymach says. Without a clear advantage, patients typically decide whether they want to start with an oral medication or an infusion. Because they have different mechanisms of action, doctors usually sequence the drugs, starting with one and then turning to the other when the disease progresses. \"Unfortunately, neither of these drugs show(s) significant activity in the brain or spinal cord, and most patients with EGFR mutations suffer from metastases to the brain,\" says Patel. \"So there's a huge need for new drugs that can penetrate the central nervous system, and some of the drugs under development are being designed specifically for that purpose.\" In the meantime, patients like Muller whose have brain metastases are affected turn to Gamma Knife radiation treatments that deliver multiple radiation beams simultane- ously to kill cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. \"To ensure the rays are focused on the tumors, they stretch a mask over your head and face, making you look JEFF BATTLES looked to enroll in clinical trials aft er NGS testing determined that he had the EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation. JEFF BATTLES looked to enroll in clinical trials aft er NGS testing determined that he had the EGFR exon 20 ASHLEY says Muller, who has had two Gamma Knife procedures, each in under an hour. Once her brain lesions were addressed, she started on Exkivity and has been taking the drug ever since. \" As long as I'm able to tolerate the medication, and it's keeping the cancer at bay, I'll stay on it,\" she says. SEQUENCING TREATMENT On Feb. 15, 2021, Jeff Battles, 53, felt odd chest pains. They became so intense that he went to the emergency room at 2 a.m., during a blizzard. A computed tomography scan revealed large tumors in his chest and throughout his rib cage. Battles had stage 4 lung cancer. A local oncologist ordered NGS genetic testing on his tumor, and while Battles awaited the results, he did two cycles of chemotherapy. \" A few weeks later, when testing showed I had the EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation, we started looking into clinical trials,\" says Battles, who owns a medical device manufacturing company in Meadville, Pennsylvania. The trial, ZENITH20, at Cleveland Clinic was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of poziotinib. \"I took an 8-milligram pill daily, and it stalled disease progression for about seven months,\" says Battles. \"But when the cancer began growing and spreading again, my doctors put me on (Rybrevant) infusions.\" As he had with poziotinib, Battles experienced a noticeable reduction in tumor size during the first month, but after seven months on Rybrevant, the effects leveled off. When his disease began progressing again, Battles did two more rounds of chemotherapy. \"We've used most of the tools in the toolbox at Cleveland Clinic, so now we're investigating other trials and treatments,\" he says. Unfortunately, Battles' experience is common among patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations . Targeted treatments like Rybrevant and Exkivity can control the cancer for months or even years, depending on the patient and the drug, but they will not cure it. NEW HORIZONS The hallmark of cancers driven by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is \"acquired resistance,\" meaning that they learn to outsmart treat- ments. When resistance is acquired, doctors often repeat biopsies and order biomarker testing to identify new mutations they can target with different therapies \u2014 and for the first time, patients with these rare muta- tions have options. \"This is the beginning of the story,\" Rodriguez says. \"It's our first attempt at getting at this mutation for patients who had previously been bundled into the EGFR category. But since we're getting a response from targeted treatment after patients (progress on) chemotherapy, we know these are effective agents.\" COVER STORY genetic mutationsASHLEY STACK Responding to the needs of our readers, we are proud to announce the launch of the new Clinical Trial Corner resource on curetoday.com.

That starts with understanding the different drug responses within EGFR exon 20 inser- tion mutations. For instance, emerging research suggests that the insertion location within EGFR mutations affects how patients respond to treatment. The more scientists learn about these responses, the better equipped they'll be to target them. The good news is that the pace of research is rapid. Several drugs that target EGFR exon 20 insertion muta- tions are under development, and a few are already avail- able. And, unlike other drugs, these treatments can work quickly, with patients responding systemically within six weeks in some cases. Previously, overall survival of only two to three years was probable. But patients on Exkivity and Rybrevant are living much longer. \" And there's a host of other new drugs coming down the pipeline,\" Heymach says. \"The exciting thing is, it's very likely there's going to be multiple options for these patients in the future.\" In the meantime, the goal for these patients is to stay one step ahead of the cancer by using Rybrevant and Exkivity as a bridge to the next best therapy. \"When I was diagnosed ... I didn't anticipate I' d be doing this well several months later,\" Renata says. \"My blond hair is more gray these days, and I don't have the high energy I used to, but I'm able to do most of my usual activities, including gardening.\" Next up: a trip to Indonesia with her husband. \"I' d like to go scuba diving,\" she says.

This Patient Information has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Issued: 53-year-old David Sturges made an appointment with a cardiologist to screen for heart disease, which ran in his family. He underwent electron beam computed tomography (CT) to check calcification in the arteries, an indicator of the disease. Although significant calcium buildup was not detected, he saw something else in the results. \"It was literally a note that said, 'We noticed this mass ... on the lower lobe of the right lung,'\" Sturges, now 75, recalls. \"If it's being followed (by a physician), good, keep following it. If not, we suggest the patient go in for further follow- up,' which I did.\" Sturges' biopsy was performed in February 2002 and showed that he had stage 1a non-small cell lung cancer. He underwent a lobectomy to remove the lower lobe of his right lung and continued with follow-up exams and scans, per his oncologist's instructions, for a year after diagnosis, when another suspicious nodule was detected. Tumors can spread from one lung to the other and beyond. How are possible metastases diagnosed in early stages? By KATHERINE MALMOON THE later, his then-surgeon recom- mended the tumor be removed. Unfortunately, the night before surgery, Sturges had a heart attack, and the procedure was not performed. He ended up seeing another oncologist, this time at UCLA, who did not recommend surgery. Monitoring continued until late 2016, when imaging showed that the tumor had grown. Surgery was once again on the table and was finally performed in August 2017 at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The follow-up schedule that Sturges' oncologists suggested, which included CT scans and blood tests, allowed them to monitor not only tumor growth, but also cancer recurrence. THE FACTS ABOUT LUNG CANCER There are two main types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which constitutes some 85% of cases, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which accounts for the other 15%. According to Dr. Malcolm DeCamp, chair of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, SCLC usually grows and spreads more quickly and is often treated with chemotherapy and radiation because tumors are too large or widespread for surgical removal. \"Non-small cell lung cancers are broken down into stages 1, 2, 3 and 4,\" DeCamp says. \" If it's under 5 centime- ters without lymph nodes involved, it's stage 1 and treated primarily with surgery, assuming the patient is fit enough. Stage 2 disease is typically treated with surgery plus chemotherapy, as lymph nodes within the lung near the tumor are now involved. Stage 3 disease is locally advanced and requires chemotherapy plus radiation or plus surgery, or maybe all three. Then stage 4 is metastatic disease that has spread outside the chest. This stage is rarely, if ever, cured and treated primarily with chemotherapy, (targeted therapy or immunotherapy) to extend survival.\" Catching a tumor in the early stages, when it can be removed, is optimal since it is potentially curable. Because Sturges' cancer was diagnosed at stage 1a, he only under- went surgery and needed no further intervention, although afterward he learned that a different treatment plan may have been more beneficial. \"It was probably two or three years after my initial surgery when (doctors) said they were finding that adju- vant therapy in combination with surgery probably gave a better outcome for people in my situation,\" he says. LIFE AFTER TREATMENT As with many other cancers, the fear of recurrence can linger long after treatment is over. But how likely is lung DAVID STURGES knew rather quickly when his lung cancer returned due to his diligence in attending follow-up screenings. J. ANNE DESIGNS PHOTOGRAPHY J. ANNE DESIGNS PHOTOGRAPHY 2624_CURELung2_Feature_On_the_Move_1122.indd 26 10/31/22 10:21 PM10/31/22 10:21 PM 27FEATURE post-treatment screening cancer to come back, and how can doctors monitor it? Dr. Xiuning Le, assistant professor of thoracic/head and neck medical oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, explains that the disease typically does not return for most patients with stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer. The five-year survival rate for patients with stage 2 disease is 40% to 60%, which decreases to 15% to 35% in patients with stage 3 disease. According to the American Cancer Society, most doctors recommend that patients who no longer show evidence of disease come in for follow-up, which may include CT scans and blood tests, every three months during the first two years, every six months for the next three years, and at least once annually after five years. Dr. Dennis Wigle, clinician scientist and chair of thoracic surgery at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, puts it this way: \"With the higher stages and potentially higher recurrence rates, we want to look more frequently right after someone's finished ... treatment so that we can detect recurrences as early as possible.\" Screening with low-dose CT scans is also done to detect new cancers, not recurrences, which are more common in current and ex-smokers (for about five to 10 years, then the risk decreases). But new cancers are more curable than recurrences, which are rarely curable. SCLC is altogether different. \"Small cell lung cancer has a reputation of early metastasis and early recurrence,\" Le says. \"It often spreads to the brain.\" The five-year survival rate is 29% if the cancer is localized, 18% if it has spread in the chest and 3% if it has spread beyond the chest. THE POTENTIAL OF RECURRENCE \"We don't have a good way to predict where the cancer is going to recur,\" Le says. \"It can recur at the same loca- tion, spread to the other side of the lung or spread to other organs like the liver, adrenal glands and colon. Most thoracic oncologists do a CT scan that includes the lungs but also the upper part of the abdomen because these are the high-risk locations for metastasis.\" Additionally, Le notes that oncolo- gists say they don't know exactly why NSCLC is more likely to spread to certain organs than others, but some experts hypothesize that it is because these locations are rich in blood circulation. STURGES started advocacy work with the founding of a nonprofit organization, which focuses on raising money for lung cancer research.J. ANNE DESIGNS PHOTOGRAPHY J. ANNE DESIGNS PHOTOGRAPHYI've been I've been very active very active in terms of sounding the alarm on the need for research and money to support research. \u2014STURGES\u2014STURGES 24_CURELung2_Feature_On_the_Move_1122.indd 2724_CURELung2_Feature_On_the_Move_1122.indd \u00b7 11.22If a patient has a recurrence, Le takes a multidisci- plinary approach. \"We start by evaluating the pattern of recurrence,\" she says. \"If the cancer comes back in one location, we may be able to offer local treatment, but if it comes back in multiple locations, there is still a role for aggressive treatment. In that case, we need to consult with medical oncology, surgery and radiation oncologists.\" After Sturges' heart attack, his doctor recommended he have CT scans every three months and then yearly until late 2016, when the scan showed his tumor had grown. In August 2017, he underwent a wedge resection in the upper lobe of his right lung and has been disease- free ever since. EFFECTIVE SCREENING METHODS So how do physicians catch lung cancer in the beginning or in the early stage of a recurrence? DeCamp says that people at high risk should be on the lookout for voice changes or a cough that doesn't go away or worsens. However, by the time symptoms appear, the disease may already be advanced. So the Screening and the Unexpected IN 2021, CHRIS HEBERT went to a cardiologist to find out why he had been feeling short of breath. He had lived with polycythemia vera, a type of blood cancer, for 16 years and knew that he was at increased risk for blood clots in the lungs. Blood work revealed that his D-dimer \u2014 a protein that indicates a clot may be present \u2014 was elevated, so he was referred for a CT scan and then a bronchoscope. Hebert received a diagnosis of stage 3 lung cancer on his 46th birthday, in November 2021. \"A lot of times, people with polycythemia vera will actually eventually end up with one form of leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, \" Hebert says. \"In my case, (doctors) could never find ... JAK2 and different genetic markers, which basically say, hey, this person is more likely to possibly end up with leukemia. Instead, I got lung cancer. It's a whole different arena. \" Hebert began treatment with chemotherapy, but his tumors didn't shrink, so radiation was added. He then underwent biomarker testing, which showed that he had the KRAS G12C mutation, for which a number of treatments are being studied. \"It's the area with the most clinical development right now, \" he says. Hebert is currently receiving treatment with adagrasib (MRTX849) as part of a clinical trial at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Screening every six weeks has shown positive effects on his cancer cells and lymph nodes. He hopes that both consistent screening and effective therapies for lung cancer will allow him and others to lead a full life. \"This doesn't last a week, \" he says. \"You're dealing with a chronic health condition that will last for the rest of your life. You just hope that you can get some time in between where you're able to sit back, enjoy life and not have to worry about when the next game is. \" Screening for a potential blood clot led to CHRIS HEBERT's diagnosis of stage 3 lung way of detecting early-stage tumors is with CT scans. This is primarily considered in individuals at high risk due to smoking history. Wigle agrees and points to the National Lung Screening Trial, in which 53,454 patients who were current or former smokers were assigned to undergo regular CT scans or chest X-rays. Investigators found more lung cancers in the CT group, and those patients had better survival outcomes. \"Increasing the buy-in to screening, at least in the at-risk population, is the lowest-hanging fruit and is the easiest way to improve survival,\" DeCamp says. \"The next lowest- hanging fruit is preventing people from smoking and getting people who smoke to quit. Then it's going to be getting a better understanding of that group that gets cancer despite not smoking.\" The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening for adults aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history. Wigle says that much of his job entails determining the risk level for each patient's lung mass. \"The frequency of having any kind of nodule is relatively high,\" he says. \"I always tell patients if we randomly did 100 scans in people at risk for lung cancer, 25 would have some kind of lung nodule that would require more investigation, but (fewer) than one of those would actually have a lung cancer.\" LOOKING TO THE FUTURE Currently, there is no approved screening test for nonsmokers, but some interesting plans are in the works. \"Dogs have an incredible sense of smell,\" DeCamp says. \"Some can actually smell ... cancer (if they are trained to do so). We're trying to understand what those neural pathways are in the canine. Then we can create a device that a patient can breathe into that can detect some of the byproducts of cancer metabolism to use as a screening test.\" DeCamp also says that because the entire respiratory tract can be at risk for lung cancer, it may be possible to develop a test that looks for a particular structure of cells swabbed from the nose or mouth that will show whether an individual is predisposed to it. And there are a number of compa - nies looking for molecular markers present in the blood of patients with cancer that disappear when the tumor is removed. If found, such biomarkers could be used to screen for lung cancer and test for recurrence. Wigle suggests that this type of blood test could be used in combina - tion with standard screening. \"It might even take over as the screening protocol, meaning you wouldn't get a CT scan until you had a positive result on some kind of blood test.\" NONSMOKING-RELATED LUNG CANCER Sturges had smoked for about 17 years but had stopped 15 or 20 years before his diagnosis. \"There's ... an attitude that there's nothing you can do for those patients,\" DeCamp says. \"That's wrong. There's something to do for almost all of them. And then there's the stigma. 'Oh, they did it to themselves; they smoked, right?' Well, a growing population of lung cancer patients have never smoked. So we need to change the face of lung cancer. Our society views a woman with breast cancer as a victim. But people don't often look at lung cancer patients as victims.\" According to DeCamp, of the 200,000 people in the U.S. who develop lung cancer every year, about 15% (30,000 patients) do so without having any known cancer risk. Two-thirds of those 30,000 are women, but it is not known why. But is the number of nonsmokers with cancer growing, or is the number of smokers who are diagnosed with lung cancer decreasing? \"The epidemiology is changing over time,\" Le says. \"Smoking overall has declined in (the) U.S. ... in the last decade. We definitely see more nonsmoker lung cancer patients, but I don't think this number is growing. They are proportionally more of the patients we see in the clinic.\" PAYING IT FORWARD According to Wigle, lung cancers are the deadliest cancer in America and lead to more deaths annually than many other cancers combined. Nevertheless, research in the field suffers from low funding from the National Institutes of Health and other government agencies. After undergoing two surgeries and witnessing the benefits of screening for himself, in 2009 Sturges and two others set up the Lung Cancer Foundation of America. This nonprofit organization raises money for research into innova - tive treatment modalities that may one day lead to a cure. \"I've been very active in terms of sounding the alarm on the need for research and money to support research,\" Sturges says. \"We started our foundation because we were concerned that we weren't getting ... a fair share from the National Cancer Institute and others, not enough money, not enough focus. ... And we need the money for research, and hopefully we can find a cure or at least as many treatment options as other cancers, so we can live and go forward.\"COLLIN RICHIESCAN THE QR CODE to hear more about the work David Sturges does with the Lung Cancer Foundation of America. is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Unfortunately, they can also be symptoms of other conditions such as pneumonia and bron- chitis. Not only that, but the latter can also present as cancer on CAT scans and X-rays, thus resulting in delayed diagnoses. \"A provider's first inclination might be to think of those conditions before thinking of lung cancer, \" Dr. Akshu Balwan, assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care at The University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque, told CURE\u00ae. Lung cancer is often diagnosed by biopsy, but imaging tests are generally used to determine in which direction to proceed. \"For certain patients, I see the CAT scan, and (I think), this is cancer until proven otherwise, \" Balwan explained. \"And there are other ones that we see, and (it) looks more like inflammation and pneumonia than a cancer. But there's considerable overlap in both the conditions and how they look. \" THE DOMINO EFFECT OF DELAYS Delays in the diagnosis of lung cancer can affect whether patients see the right specialist and even the treatment they receive. \"Nowadays, most cancer centers have a multidis- ciplinary team, and ... with diagnosing lung cancer, we try to avoid those delays, \" Balwan noted. \"Instead of seeing everybody in the pathway, we want to try to get them to the treatment as soon as we can. We discuss and we try to get them to the right physician, whether it's an oncologist, a surgeon or a radiation oncologist, in the shortest amount of time. \" That's not to say that health care professionals cannot determine what lung cancer is and isn't, but their conclusions may depend on the patient's medical history, including smoking status. \"Most providers should be able to identify the chronicity of symptoms and would think about the diagnosis such as lung cancer in a patient who has smoked or has other risk factors for lung cancer, \" Balwan told CURE\u00ae. \"Sometimes diagnosis can be challenging in patients who develop lung cancer despite being nonsmokers. \" Most physicians are receptive to what patients think, especially if they're concerned about lung cancer and have the risk factors for it. But that doesn't mean patients are immediately biopsied. Doctors tend to start with chest imaging to spare patients from such unnecessary complications as pain, infection and blood clots. WHAT PATIENTS SHOULD DO Balwan recommends that patients describe their symptoms in detail and seek care early on instead of waiting to see what happens. \"(It's important to be) aware of your bodily func- tions and what is normal or abnormal for you to avoid any delays, \" he explained. Sometimes, he added, symptom duration can help a physician diagnose a patient in a timely manner, especially if that patient received treatment for another condition but saw no improvement. \"If your symptoms persist despite treatment for the diagnosis that you received, and are in line with possible symptoms with lung cancer, you should discuss (it) with your health care provider, especially if you have risk factors for lung cancer and consider chest imaging, \" Balwan concluded.Patients should describe their symptoms in detail and seek early care for suspected lung cancer, especially since the disease may resemble pneumonia and bronchitis on imaging tests.

Dr. Estelamari Rodriguez, Dr. Pierre de Delva and Alesha Arnold received their awards during the 2022 North America Conference on Lung Cancer, organized by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. Support for the 2022 Lung Cancer Heroes\u00ae was provided by Takeda Oncology, Blueprint Medicines and Mirati Therapeutics. Colleagues, patients and their relatives submitted essays detailing the noble actions of the trio and 15 others and nominating them for the accolade. \"This year, CURE\u00aecelebrates its 20th anniversary, and as I look back on how far we've come in the lung cancer space in 20 years, it feels like night and day,\" said Kristie L. Kahl, vice president of content at CURE\u00ae and its parent company, MJH Life Sciences\u00ae, during the event. \"What once was considered a poor prog- nosis for all is now a disease (about which) patients and their loved ones can have hope, survivorship and quality of life, because science has rapidly advanced in recent years and care has improved tenfold.\" Tackling Lung Cancer In 2006, Chris Draft, at the time a linebacker for the Carolina Panthers, PHOTOS BY LARRY REMIKERThe CURE\u00ae Lung Cancer Heroes program thanks those who have positively affected the lives of patients with lung cancer.

PIERRE DE DELVA AND ALESHA ARNOLD Lung Cancer Heroes\u00ae is proudly supported Takeda Blueprint BY LARRY REMIKERmet Keasha Rutledge, a pharmaceutical sales executive in the prime of life. As she was preparing for a 10K race in November 2010, she began experi- encing shortness of breath. A routine visit to her primary care physician led to a chest X-ray that revealed she had stage 4 lung cancer. One year later \u2014 on Nov. 27, 2011 \u2014 Draft and Rutledge launched the nonprofit Team Draft at their wedding, with the goal of continuing to tackle lung cancer. Sadly, Rutledge died from the disease a month later, at the age of 38. Since then, Draft, founder, president and CEO of the Chris Draft Family Foundation, has spent the past 11 years empowering families to lead a healthy lifestyle. He has also dedicated his life to developing close relationships with lung cancer survivors, their caregivers, doctors and cancer centers across the country. During his keynote address, he stressed the importance of honoring those who have transformed the space of lung cancer and thanked CURE\u00ae for instituting and continuing with the program. And he encouraged everyone to take a stand against lung cancer, noting that \"the positive change that we want ... will happen because amazing people have decided to take a stand.\" He added, \"The lung cancer commu- nity for too long has stayed silent. For too long, we've allowed the old messages of just getting people to stop smoking to play out, without making it clear that the times have changed. Prevention is not good enough; survi- vorship has to be the goal. We can still max out prevention. But we have early detection and treatment, research and survivorship.\" A Physician and Community Activist One of the three Lung Cancer Heroes\u00ae recipients was Dr. Estelamari Rodriguez, associate director of community outreach in thoracic oncology at the University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. She was nominated by her colleague, Tisdrey Torres, an advanced practice registered nurse at the center. Torres wrote that Rodriguez had dedicated her career to caring and advocating for patients with lung cancer and their caregivers, focusing on improving lung cancer screening programs and raising awareness about the need for more funding for lung cancer research. What really sets Rodriguez apart, according to Torres, is the work she does with the community. \"In addition to her arduous work in the clinical field, Dr. Rodriguez also finds time to frequently engage in community activities,\" Torres wrote in her nominating essay. Inspiration Without Ever Meeting Alesha Arnold, who has been a nurse since 1997, has spent the past several years working as a breast cancer research nurse at Indiana University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Indianapolis. While in college, she used to travel back to her hometown to care for her mother, who had breast cancer. lung cancer heroes\u00ae FROM LEFT: CURE\u00ae Vice President of Content KRISTIE DR.

Her connection to cancer didn't end there, as her grandfather died from lung cancer. When she was 44, Arnold herself received a diagnosis of advanced lung cancer, which shocked her because she had never smoked, as she told her nominator, LaTrice G. Vaughn, also a registered nursein Indiana. What most impresses Vaughn is Arnold's willingness to connect with others and educate them about the disease. \"She has brought awareness of lung cancer to her family, sorority, colleagues, church family, friends and even to those she doesn't know,\" Vaughn wrote in her nominating essay, \"my aunt being one.\" Vaughn and Arnold are both from Gary, Indiana. Vaughn's aunt was recently diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Vaughn said she told Arnold about the news and notes that Arnold let her know about a project she was participating in, known as the White Ribbon Project. \"Well, wouldn't you know that Alesha and her wood carving party members made over 25 ribbons, and she brought one to me for my aunt,\" Vaughn recalled. \"I took it home when I was going to one of my aunt's chemotherapy and doctor's appointments. I had to remember that my aunt lived through an era when smoking was permitted. ... She had a sense of her diagnosis being a cause of her own destructive habit. What she did not know was that lung cancer can affect a nonsmoker. What she did not know is that lung cancer affected a 44-year-old African American woman from her hometown. ... My aunt was astonished that this amazing person would take time out to make a white wooden ribbon especially for her.\" Reducing Incidence and Mortality Rate Dr. Pierre de Delva, section chief of general thoracic surgery at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, was nominated by Amy Ellis. In her essay, she noted that de Delva practices in a state with some of the poorest lung cancer outcomes in the nation and serves at its sole academic health science center, medical school and safety net hospital. She further explained that de Delva's research interests include outcomes and quality improvement in thoracic surgery, health disparities in cancer and the development of biologic tracheal substitutes. Of note, a tracheal substi- tute is a method to replace a person's affected and/or diseased airway. Ellis also mentioned that de Delva had led a project to address common barriers to biomarker testing within the state. \"Under Dr. de Delva's leadership, almost every hospital treating cancer patients in Mississippi joined the pilot with representation from almost 90 multidisciplinary thoracic clinicians,\" Ellis wrote. \"The biomarker pilot has the downstream potential to impact the course of cancer care for nearly all of the 2,810 Mississippians estimated by the American Cancer Society to be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2022.\" Although the project closed in January 2022, Ellis noted that de Delva had become inaugural chair of the newly formed Mississippi Lung Cancer Roundtable, which is committed to reducing the incidence, affect and mortality of lung cancer in the state.

Saturday, March 4, 2023 Miami Florida BAIK THE FIVE-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE for patients with early-stage lung cancer that has not spread to the lymph nodes or other organs is 56%; however, when the disease spreads, the survival rate decreases to just 5%. Therefore, an open and honest discussion with one's oncologist is key to determining which treat- ment will be best in the most e cient time frame, Dr. Peter Baik says. As part of the CURE\u00ae \"Speaking Out\" video series, Baik \u2014 a thoracic surgeon at Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Phoenix and Chicago \u2014 discussed the importance of prioritizing quality of life while also contem- plating a second opinion when considering treatment options for early-stage lung cancer in an expeditious way. Q:Q:Why is it important for patients to have an active role in choosing treatment options, especially when quality of life is a concern? A:A:With lung cancer treatment, especially early stage, the rst thing we think of is surgery; but now there's radiation and new therapies coming up. So, quality of life, we have to take that into consideration. What do you like to do? Do you like to run marathons and can't do without it? Then surgery may not be the best option. (Another example is if you're a longtime smoker and do not want to carry an oxygen bottle around), ... I have to make sure that they understand the potential complications (of surgery). If you are in the hospital for two or three days, sometimes ve, after surgery, you're going to be debilitated. Who's going to help you after surgery? (Will you) have the right support, physically, emotionally and mentally? That's the other important thing that we have to consider, can family support you? And so talking about all those things is paramount. But the most important thing is for you to understand exactly what you're dealing with. You're told that you have stage 1 lung cancer, you have a small nodule, you could just take it out surgically. What does that mean? What I try to do is share images with a patient. I show them the (combined positive score [the ratio of the number of all PD-L1-expressing cells]). SPEAKING OUT LUNG CANCER As part of its \"Speaking Out\" video series, CURE \u00ae spoke with Dr. Peter Baik, on behalf of Cancer Treatment Centers of America, about treatment decision-making in early-stage lung cancer. By KRISTIE L. out I may even draw it out for them, or whatever I have to do, so patients can understand it's a shared decision. Q:Q:What are some of the benefits of minimally invasive surgery? A:A:(The di erence between minimally invasive and invasive is) a big cut versus a small cut. For example, there are a lot of patients who love to golf. And when you swing, the big back muscle, the wing muscles, your swings can be really a ected. But if you do (min- imally invasive surgery), you don't have to do all those things (with invasive surgery). For example, I had a patient who came in with a nodule that needed to be removed, and they were planning on doing an open procedure. If he had the (open) procedure, he would not be able to go back to golf for at least six weeks. And it was kind of interesting, because I did the (minimally invasive surgery and he) was discharged the next day. Two weeks later, when I saw him in clinic, he asked me, \"Hey, when can I play golf?\" And knowing him (personally), I asked him, \"You haven't played yet?\" It's all about the pain and being able to recover. The wound heals (better) when it's smaller. If you have a big (wound), it's going to take longer; you've got big muscle groups that are cut and it has to heal, and it's never going to be the same. Q:Q:How can patients learn more about their surgical options and what might be best for them? A:A:That's the good thing about Dr. Google, but you have to make sure that you go to reputable resources. There are sites that try to give you a lot of di erent options for surgery. But the most important thing is, if you have any doubts or questions, you could always ask for a second opinion. (When patients get a) second opinion, (it's to help) if they don't understand (their options) or they just don't feel comfortable. It doesn't hurt me if patients don't feel comfortable with me. As long as the patient understands what the options are, the best options, and they get the best treatment. That's the most important thing. If they don't feel comfortable, it doesn't hurt my feelings. Why? Because there has to be a trust, there has to be con - dence. And all those things play (a role) when it comes to healing. Q:Q:What is the most important piece of advice you have for patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer who are weighing their treatment options? A:A:The important thing is to make sure things are progressing. You don't want to wait two months, three months to get things done or the staging done. Anytime you have a lung nodule, and it's diagnosed as lung cancer, you have a chance for those microscopic cancer cells to (spread) somewhere else, because that's what they like to do. And once lung cancer (spreads) into the lymph nodes farther away, or you have metastasis, your five-year survival decreases dramatically. So you want to make sure that you get the proper treatments, workup, expeditiously. It's not possible to get the stage tomorrow and then get the surgery. If you have to wait a month for an appointment, another month for a procedure, then another month to see someone else, time is of the essence.
