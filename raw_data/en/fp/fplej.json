[New York](https://www.tatlerasia.com/lifestyle/entertainment/bling-empire-new-york-stephen-hung-deborah-hung-netflix)-based practitioner Zoey Gong has built quite the name for herself in the wellness space for sharing and preserving the knowledge of TCM through her educational content, easy-to-follow recipes and science-backed approached to TCM. \"Rather than promoting products, I want to focus on education because I believe it is the foundation for everything. Education allows people to live healthier, happier, and more sustainable lives,\" she says. Following the launch of Gong's first book, The Five Elements Cookbook, we caught up with her to talk about about incorporating TCM into modern lifestyles, and how her life's work has helped her connect deeper with her Chinese roots. When you moved to the US from Shanghai, you began to develop an array of health problems. What is it about modern or Western lifestyles that can be harmful to our health? When I was 16 years old, I started having health problems after only two months of living in the US. I gained 15 pounds and started to have constant skin rash and joint pain. After a year, I found a hard lump in my breast, which was diagnosed as a benign tumour and quickly removed by surgery. In retrospect, all these health problems started because of the American diet, which is full of processed foods, refined sugar, additives, and dairy. My condition got a lot better after I changed the way I ate. It was like magic. Modern lifestyles really distance us from nature. You could say that, in some way, we are losing our natural instinct around food\u2014foods, drinks, and products we consume nowadays are often highly processed\u2014yet our bodies are still designed to digest and utilise things from nature. How can one apply ancient philosophies, like TCM, to their modern lifestyles? It is really easy. To start, I recommend picking up a beginner TCM book and learning the basics. Following practitioners on Instagram and Tiktok is also a great way to learn nowadays. After you understand the basics, start to build awareness of your own body. What does your tongue look like today? What constitution do you have? Are you a \"heated\" person or a \"cold\" person? When you become aware of your body, you will start to notice what foods and lifestyle choices make you feel your best without having to follow a strict diet or one-formula-fits-all routine. We are all different! If you can find a TCM practitioner in your area, go for an acupuncture session and let find out what your major imbalances are. I recommend visiting several practitioners until you find one that aligns with your goals and energy the most. Did studying TCM help you feel more connected to your Chinese heritage? Yes, definitely. I'm constantly in awe of the wisdom of my ancestors and how much Chinese culture has influenced others around the world. I didn't realise this before I started my career in TCM. I feel blessed that I can make a living from pursuing my passions, while also finding greater connection to my Chinese roots. See Also: [For a Growing Number of Women, Tattoos Are About "}
