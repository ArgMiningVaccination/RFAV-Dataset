Those who opt to medicate with non-stimulants require fewer follow-ups and decrease their likelihood of developing a physiological dependence. Side Effects of Non-Stimulant ADHD Medication Non-stimulant medications come in a variety of forms and thus have different side effects. However, someone can expect to experience a few typical adverse reactions. [Medications ](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/adhd-meds/)may leave you feeling run down, uncomfortable, or moody. You should consult your doctor about any symptoms before beginning a regular medication routine. Side effects of non-stimulant ADHD medications can include: - Fatigue - Nausea - Headaches - Decreased appetite - Mood swings - Sleep difficulties [Depression](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/depression/) Atomoxetine Atomoxetine is part of a class of medications known as SNRIs and is primarily used in the treatment of depression and anxiety. It also comes in the brand name of [Strattera](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/strattera-atomoxetine/). Atomoxetine is the generic medication. This medication works by increasing the amount of neurotransmitters in the brain and has been proven clinically effective for combating ADHD symptoms. Research also suggests that it works to improve social and family functioning; and, in some studies, it has been shown to be non-inferior to stimulant medications.1 Side Effects of Atomoxetine While an FDA approved method of treating ADHD, Atomoxetine does come with a myriad of side effects. Atomoxetine carries a black box warning, the most serious warning from the FDA for suicidal ideation in adolescent patients. Still, Atomoxetine is typically well tolerated, producing mainly mild adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, and constipation.2 Long-Acting Guanfacine Guanfacine is an alpha-2-agonist used for treating ADHD in children or as an off-label (not FDA approved) medication for adults. It comes as a brand name of Intuniv. Guanfacine is the generic medication. Originally designed as a treatment for high blood pressure, this prescription has been shown to improve a patient's impulsivity and inattentiveness.9 Side Effects of Long-Acting Guanfacine Side effects of Guanfacine tend to be relatively mild. However, the drug can cause decreased blood pressure and heart rate. Alternatively, if a patient stops taking their prescription abruptly, they may experience the opposite. Doctors recommend that users slowly decrease dosages if they are seeking to stop taking the medication. Patients should also maintain regular height and weight check routines.3 Wellbutrin Wellbutrin is the brand name for the medication buproprion. It works by decreasing the reuptake of certain neurotransmitters in the brain and is used as an off-label medication for the treatment of ADHD.4 An off-label medication means that it is not FDA approved, but doctors may prescribe it at their discretion because they have a reason to believe it can provide a benefit for a patient. In a recent 2005 study, participants prescribed Wellbutrin reported an overall improvement in their ADHD symptoms.5 There have been a few other clinical trials testing its effectiveness, but further studies are needed before wellbutrin is approved for FDA use in ADHD. Side Effects of Wellbutrin Wellbutrin carries a black box warning, the most serious warning from the FDA for suicidal ideation in adolescent patients.4 Additionally, doctors do not recommend use in patients with severely low BMI and have a history of a seizure disorder. Other common side effects of wellbutrin can include:4 - Increased heart rate - Insomnia - Headache - Tremors Effexor Effexor is the brand name for the medication venlafaxine. It is another SNRI that functions by blocking the reuptake of neurotransmitters within the brain.6 Typically used in the treatment of depression and anxiety, it can also be utilized as an off-label medication for those with ADHD. While some studies have shown Effexor as an effective non-stimulant for ADHD, the data isn't very concise. Side Effects of Effexor Effexor carries a black box warning, the most serious warning from the FDA for suicidal ideation in adolescent patients. Common side effects of Effexor can include: - Headache - Nausea - Insomnia - Decreased libido or the inability to orgasm Serious adverse reactions can include: - Increased suicidal ideation - Steven Johnson syndrome - Serotonin syndrome *It is important to note that Effexor should not be combined with stimulants or antidepressants, as it may increase the likelihood of a patient developing serotonin syndrome.6 Best Non Stimulant ADHD Medications for Kids While stimulant medications are considered first-line treatment for children with ADHD, some parents may elect to pursue alternative methods. In these cases, non-stimulants can be a good option. The FDA has approved three non-stimulants for the use in children: atomoxetine viloxazine (Qelbree). These medications have been proven effective in managing inattentiveness and agitation associated with ADHD.7 Despite being less potent than traditional stimulants, non-stimulants greatly reduce any risk of abuse and addiction in children. 7 The following are reliable non-stimulant [ADHD medications for children](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/adhd-medications-for-kids/): Atomoxetine Strattera is the brand name for atomoxetine and it was the first non-stimulant medication to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents.7 Doctors recommended that children start dosages at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg (milligrams per kilogram) with a maximum of 1.4 mg/kg or 100 mg as a total dosage.7 A child prescribed Starttera can expect a decrease in negative ADHD symptoms including restlessness, impulsivity, and inattentiveness. Patients should be carefully monitiored while taking Strattera as it carries a black box warning, the most serious warning from the FDA, for increased risk of suicidal ideation in children and adolescents.7 Common side effects of Strattera may include: - Headache - Dry eyes - Nausea/vomiting - Loss of appetite - Abdominal Pain Qelbree Qelbree is the brand name for viloxazine and works similarly to Effexor by increasing the number of neurotransmitters in a patient's brain.8 Clinical trials have shown the drug to be effective in children for combating ADHD symptoms when prescribed in daily doses of between 100 mg and 400mg.8 For adolescent patients, weekly doses start at 200mg with a maximum recommendation of 400mg.8 Side effects of Qelbree are commonly mild. However, like Strattera, patients should be carefully monitored while taking Qelbree as it carries a black box warning, the most serious warning from the FDA, for increased risk of suicidal ideation in children and adolescents.8 Common side effects of Qelbree may include: - Nausea - Vomiting - Headache - Increased blood pressure - Heart rate increase Questions to Ask Your Health Team About Non Stimulant ADHD Medication It is important that you and your healthcare team formulate a treatment plan that is both effective and healthy for you or your child.
