Great friendly place. I'm already feeling so much better after 2 weeks. They really want to help you feel better. Would highly recommend this place.\" *\"Came here to solve my tickborne illness issue and I don't know where I would be without the help of the team here! My mom and I would go to our appointments together and it honestly changed both of our live for the best with the thorough testing and treatments!\" *\"Kind and knowledgeable staff; Clean and new facility/equipment; They deliver results. I came here in pain and barely able to bend my back, after completing the therapy plan I felt better than I had in 20 years. Thank you.\" *\"I've got to say everyone there is amazing! So nice and caring. They help me so much! My whole back is a mess and they always fix me up and have me feeling better when I go. Definitely give them a try.\" *\"I don't think I give any place a five. But I would give this place definitely a 4 1/2. Very happy with Dr. Province. She did testing on me, found so many food intolerances and so many issues that I have been dealing with for probably 25 years. I thought I was just going to the chiropractor when I went to this place and it has been so much more. A good functional medicine doctor can change your life. As far as the Chiropractor part, there's several there and so you might get a different one each time. But overall, I'm glad I chose to go here.\" *\"I have been to multiple Chiropractors over the years and Dr. Province and her team have been the best experience I have ever had. They take the extra steps every visit to ensure that your needs are met. I would recommend Dr. Province and Integrated Medical to anyone! \" *\"Started my treatment 6 weeks ago, I was always tired and feeling depressed, so far my mood has improved and the mind fog is gone, I can focus more at work and my family has noticed my health improvement.\" *\"Normally I dread going to any kind of doctor's office but the team here is always happy to see patients and is always friendly. Would very much recommend integrated to friends and family.\" *\"Integrated Medical had taken great care of our family for years. They are super flexible on appointments and allow us to walk in when needed. They always have great recommendations on alternative treatments or further medical imaging/testing when necessary.\" *\"Integrated Medical is top shelf self care. everyone is friendly and professional. miracle workers. they use a combination of methods to optimize spinal alignment ; crack , zap, sound , needles. also doing hormonal balance . apparently i needed more testosterone . plus, right off the bike trail . they do need bike racks though. but the park next door has them.\" *\"Been coming here for a few months now and am enjoying it. Everyone is nice. Excited to keep coming and continue to feel better and better.\" *\"I have been coming to Integrated Medical since before they were called Integrated Medical. This is a fantastic place. I first started coming here for really bad headaches, neck, and back pain. Every doctor that I would go and see before I started coming here kept trying to diagnose me as being depressed when I wasn't. I am relatively pain free now and they keep me going with my normal in and out visits. I would highly recommend Integrated Medical to anyone.\" *\"I've been coming here for a couple years (on and off) and have always been treated uniquely, with care and specific treatment. The staff is super friendly and always helpful. They are constantly looking for ways to help you feel better, no matter how big or small the pain. I definitely recommend stopping by no matter if you think you need it or not!\" *\"I'm over the moon about the care I've received at Integrated Medical so far. I live an hour and half away, but it has absolutely been worth the drive. I found Integrated Medical after being involved in a car accident a few months ago, and had pain that wasn't resolving. There were chiropractors and physical therapists closer to me, but none that provided comprehensive therapy like I've received at "}
