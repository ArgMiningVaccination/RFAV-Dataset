Yes.. Life can simply be full ~ and that's wonderful. B A L A N C E can often elude us with all of the plans and then the 'un-planned' throwing the proverbial 'monkey wrench' into the mix. DIY bath crystals can be one self-care choice! Maybe we need to 'schedule' some ME time.. Make a date with ourself and lock that bathroom door, run a soothing, warm bath and take 15 minutes 'OFF'. I know we all have different lives with unique challenges. This may or may not work for you ~ I sure hope that, against all odds ~ you can find the time to both make these life-enhancing DIY bath crystals AND enjoy them! Tip: They make a healthy uplifting gift for friends and family members. They can be packaged in a simple brown paper bag or a tag sale jar or a glass canning jar with lid. EASY and so appreciated!
