Instead, many people are wearing brand new clothes that have never been cleared of chemicals or clothing that has been washed with toxic laundry products and fabric softeners. Brand new clothes and clothes washed in conventional laundry products have chemical residues that are [ harmful to health](https://branchbasics.com/learn/laundry-101/) and should be outgassed. After repeated washings our clothes become incorporated with the chemicals and dyes from the detergents. Since toxins can enter the body not only by inhalation through the respiratory tract, but also by absorption through the skin our bodies receive a double dose from these scented toxic laundry products. In addition your clothing may appear white and bright because of the chemical whiteners, yet they are a toxic waste by-product and a menace to your health. The synthetic fragrances may seem pleasant, but they are neurotoxic and are endocrine disruptors. Most people don't get sick immediately by wearing the garments, but the absorption of these chemicals/metals consistently over the long term presents a potential for immune system depression and illness.

Sleeping on sheets or wearing clothes that have been washed in conventional detergents contribute to the chemical load that the body has to detoxify. This is especially an issue when sleeping because at night when the immune system is supposed to rest and repair, it instead has to use its energy to detoxify chemicals from the Bedding & Mattresses and pajamas. The kidneys and liver have to work harder through the night instead of rejuvenate and repair. It may take several treatments to remove detergent residues especially if fabric softeners have been used. If clothes are contaminated with mold or pesticides, a more extensive procedure is needed.

Turn them inside out to minimize fading. Lay out on flat surface if possible. This will help to outgas the chemicals from the clothes. Ideally, keep sunning until all smell is gone or almost gone. Don't underestimate the power of the sun. You can save wear and tear on your clothes and cut down the number of times you have to wash them if you partner with the sunshine. Note: Many times new clothes can be completely outgassed just by sunning - Take sheets or clothes and place in a big sink or top loading washing machine and cover with cold water or hot water if appropriate for the fabric. Let soak several hours, all day, or overnight with the following: - 1 capful Branch Basics Laundry Solution* - 2 scoops Oxygen Boost - 1 - 2 small boxes baking soda - helps deodorize - \u00bd - 1 cup Borax - if clothes are moldy or musty (We only recommend the use of Borax if clothing is contaminated with mold and other methods have not worked.

IMPORTANT - Fully detoxified clothes and Bedding & Mattresses will have no fragrance - It can take a long time to detoxify clothes fully, especially if fabric softeners have been used. Just keep washing and sunning them. Sunning is KEY! - For the Chemically Sensitive: To protect those recovering from illness from the fumes that may be generated when drying these clothes, ventilate the laundry room. Place fans facing out of nearest window (in the laundry room, if possible) to draw fumes out of the house. Do not have fans facing out of other areas of the home because these fans will draw air from the laundry room throughout the house. Take-Home Message IMPORTANT: If you previously washed your clothes, especially undergarments, in standard laundry detergent, we highly recommended that you wash them at least four consecutive times in the wash cycle before wearing them. - To get started with the Branch Basics products mentioned in this article and to learn more about all natural, human safe cleaning products, [start](https://branchbasics.com/collections/all) [here](https://branchbasics.com/collections/all). - To detoxify your cleaning habits beyond the laundry room, try the Branch Basics [Premium Starter Kit](https://branchbasics.com/products/starter-kit-oxygen-boost).
