All enrollments with an effective date on or after January 1, 2021, must be processed in accordance with the revised requirements, including the new model Medicare Advantage (MA) enrollment form for the 2021 plan year starting October 1 5, 2020 and model notices, as appropriate. Organizations may, at their option, implement any new requirement consistent with this guidance prior to the required implementation date. It is expected that organizations will assure compliance with all Medicare Advantage requirements described in this chapter regarding communications made with beneficiaries/members, including the use of the model notices, and the requirements outlined in the Medicare Communications and Marketing Guidelines (MCMG) . Organizations are required t o provide information to individuals in accessible/ alternate formats (for example, Large Print, Braille), upon request and thereafter, as outlined in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (and subsequent revisions) . Such individuals must have an eq ual opportunity to participate in enrollment, paying premium bills, and communicating with the plan, as members who do not request accessible/ alternate formats.

The instructions provided in this chapter apply to MA plans, including MA -PD plans. Instructions for enrollment (and disenrollment) in a Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) or an 1876 cost plan are provided in a separate guidance. 10 - Definitions The following definitions relate to topics addressed in this guidance. Application Date - For paper enrollment forms and other enrollment reque st mechanisms, the application date is the date the enrollment request is initially received by the organization as defined below. Plans must use this date in the appropriate field when submitting enrollment transactions to CMS. A summary of application dates for CMS enrollment transactions is provided in Appendix 3 of this guidance. For requests sent by mail, the application date is the date the application is received by the organization ( i.e., arrives in the organization's mailbox or mailroom ); the postmark is irrelevant). For requests received by fax, the application date is the date the fax is received on the organization's fax machine. For requests submitted to sales agents, including brokers, the application date is the date the agent and/or broke r receives (accepts) the enrollment request and not the date the organization receives the enrollment request from the agent and/or broker. For purposes of enrollment, receipt by the agent or broker employed by or contracting with the organization, is con sidered receipt by the plan, thus all CMS required timeframes for enrollment processing begin on this date. For requests accepted by approved telephonic enrollment mechanisms, the application date is the date of the call. The call must have followed the a pproved script, included a clear statement that the individual understands he or she is requesting enrollment, and have been recorded. The Medicare.gov Online Enrollment Center (OEC) uses coordinated Universal Time (UTC, which was formerly known as Greenwi ch Meant Time and is four hours ahead of Eastern Daylight Time and five hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time) as the system time to generate the timestamp of when an enrollment was received. For requests made via the (OEC), the application date to be used for processing the enrollment request is the time and date that is 11 hours earlier than the time and date CMS \"stamps\" on the enrollment request at the time the individual completed the OEC process. This is true regardless of when an organization ultimat ely retrieves or downloads the request. Example: An individual completes an enrollment request and submits it via the OEC at 9:00 p.m. EST on December 7. The OEC will \"stamp\" this request as having been completed on December 8 at 2:00 a.m. , which is the UTC equivalent time and date. The organization will use December 7, 3:00 p.m., as the application date for the purpose of addressing CMS enrollment policy requirements (e.g. application date, determination of election period, etc.) . 10 For electronic enrollment requests made using the organization's system instead of the OEC , the application date is the date the applicant completes the request through the organization's electronic enrollment process. This is true regardless of when an organ ization ultimately retrieves or downloads the request. For all enrollments into employer group or union sponsored plans using the Special Enrollment Period for Employer or Union Group Health Plans ( SEP EGHP) , the application date used on the transaction su bmitted to CMS will always be the first of the month prior to the effective date of enrollment for all mechanisms at all times. For the purposes of providing notices and meeting other timeframe requirements provided in this guidance, use the date the org anization receives the request. For example, if a valid group enrollment mechanism file is received by the organization on January 24th for enrollments effective February 1st, the receipt date for the provision of required notices is January 24th and the application date submitted on the enrollment transactions is January 1st. For auto - or facilitated enrollment, as described in \u00a740.1.5, the application date is the first day of the month prior to the effective date of the auto/facilitated enrollment. This will ensure that any subsequent beneficiary -generated enrollment request will supersede the auto- or facilitated enrollment in CMS systems. At-risk Beneficiary - A Part D eligible individual who is determined to be at -risk for misuse or abuse of a frequently abused drug in accordance with the requirements for drug management programs at 42 CFR 423.153(f). Additional guidance about Part D drug management programs is available at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription -Drug - Coverage/PrescriptionDrugCovContra/RxUtilization.html (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) Authorized Representative /Legal Representative - An individual who is the legal representative or otherwise legally able to act on behalf of an enrollee , as the law of the State in which the beneficiary resides may allow, in order to execute an enrollment or disenrollment request ; e.g., court appointed legal guardians, persons having durable power of attorney for health care decisions, or individuals authorized to make health care decisions under state surrogate consent laws, provided they have the authority t o act for the beneficiary in this capacity (see \u00a740.2.1). Form CMS -1696 may not be used to appoint an authorized representative for the purposes of enrollment and disenrollment. This form is solely for use in the claims adjudication or claim appeals proces s, and does not provide broad legal authority to make another individual's healthcare decisions . Cancellation of Enrollment Request - An action initiated by the beneficiary to cancel an enrollment request . To be valid, the cancellation request must be rec eived by the organization before the enrollment effective date. A n enrollment request that has been appropriately cancelled is considered not to have been used and the election remains available for use within the time frame of the applicable election peri od. Completed Election - An enrollment request is considered complete when: 1. The form/request is signed by the beneficiary or legal representative (refer to \u00a740.2.1 for a discussion of who is considered to be a legal representat ive), or the enrollment request mechanism is completed ; 11 2. For enrollments, evidence of entitlement to Medicare Part A and enrollment in Medicare Part B is obtained by the Medicare Advantage organization (see below for definition of \"evidence of Medicare Part A and Part B coverage\"); 3. All necessary elements on the form are completed (for enrollments, see Appendix 2 for a list of elements that must be completed) or when the enrollment request mechanism is completed as CMS directs , and, when applicable; 4. Certification of a legal representative's authority to make the enrollment request is obtained by attestation (refer to \u00a740.2.1). 5. For Special Needs Plans (SNP), verification of SNP eligibility , as described in \u00a720.11. Chronic condition SNPs (C -SNP) that u tilize a CMS -approved pre -enrollment qualification assessment tool will consider the enrollment request to be complete upon receipt of the completed tool. If an individual is involuntarily disenrolled for failure to pay premiums, to re -enroll in that plan, or enroll into another, he or she would need to request enrollment during a valid enrollment period. In addition, for enrollments into an MA -only (non MA -PD) plan, an MA organization may also choose to wait for the individual's payment of the plan premi um, including any premiums due the MA organization for a prior enrollment before considering an enrollment \"complete.\" Continuation Area/Continuation of Enrollment Option - A continuation area is an additional CMS -approved area outside the MA local plan's service area within which the MA organization furnishes or arranges for furnishing of services to the MA local plan's continuation of enrollment members. MA organizations have the option of establishing continuation areas for MA local plans. Conversions - For individuals who are enrolled in a health plan offered by the MA organization the month immediately before the month of their entitlement to Medicare Parts A and B, their enrollment in an MA plan offered by the same organization is referred to as a \"c onversion\" from non- Medicare status to MA enrollee status. In order for the individual's enrollment with the organization as an MA enrollee to take effect upon becoming eligible for Medicare, conversions must take place during the individual's Initial Cove rage Election Period (ICEP). Denial of Enrollment Request - Occurs when an MA organization determines that an individual is not eligible to make an enrollment request (e.g., the individual is not entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Part B, the indi vidual is not making the enrollment request during an election period, etc.), and therefore determines it should not submit the enrollment request transaction to CMS. Effective Date of Coverage/Enrollment - The date on which an individual's coverage in an MA plan begins. The MA organization must determine the effective date of enrollment for all enrollment requests. Instructions for determining the correct effective date of coverage are provided in \u00a730. 6. Election - Enrollment in, or voluntary disenrollment from, an MA plan or the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program (\"Original Medicare\") constitutes an election. (Disenrollment from Original Medicare would occur only when an individual enrolls in an MA plan.) The term \"election\" is used to describe either an enrollment or voluntary disenrollment. If the t erm \"enrollment\" is used alone, however, then the term is used deliberately, i.e., it is being used to describe only an enrollment, and 12 not a disenrollment. T he same applies when the term \"disenrollment\" is used alone, i.e., the term is being used to describe only a disenrollment, and not an enrollment. Election Period - The time(s) during which an eligible individual may request to enroll in or disenroll from an MA plan. The type of election period determines the effective date of MA coverage as well as the types of enrollment requests allowed . There are several types of election periods, all of which are defined under \u00a730. Enrollment Request Mechanism - A me thod used by individuals to request to enroll in an MA plan. Several model individual enrollment forms are provided in the Exhibits at the end of this guidance. An individual who is a member of an MA plan and who wishes to elect another MA plan, even if it is offered by the same MA organization, must complete a new election during a valid enrollment period to enroll in the new MA plan. However, that individual may use a short enrollment form (refer to Exhibit 3) or a \"plan selection\" form (refer to Exhibit 3a) to make the election in place of the comprehensive individual enrollment form, or, may complete the election via an electronic enrollment mechanism , as described in \u00a740.1. 2 of this guidance, or by telephone, as described in \u00a740.1. 3 of this guidance, if the MA organization offers these options. In addition, MA organizations may want to collaborate with Employer or Union Group Health Plans (EGHPs) to use a single enrollment form (or other CMS approved method, if available) for EGHP me mbers; a model EGHP enrollment form for this purpose is provided in Exhibit 2. Beneficiaries or their legal representatives must complete an enrollment request mechanism (e.g. enrollment form) to enroll in an MA plan. Beneficiaries are not required to use a specific form to disenroll from an MA plan; however, a model disenrollment form is provided in Exhibit 10. Evidence of Entitlement (Medicare Part A and Part B Coverage) - Documentation , materials or other information that confirms an individual is enti tled to coverage under Parts A and B of Medicare. Evidence of entitlement is a requirement to determine eligibility for enrollment into a MA plan. It includes the individual's coverage start dates for Part A and Part B. CMS systems are updated within two business days of SSA processing a new or changed Part A or Part B entitlement. MA organization s must verify Medicare entitlement for all enrollment requests using either the Batch Eligibility Query (BEQ) process or MARx online query (M232 screen). Therefore, the applicant is not required to provide evidence with the enrollment request. (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) Evidence of Permanent Residence - A permanent residence is normally the enrollee's primary residence. An MA organization may request additional information such as voter's registratio n records, driver's license records, tax records, and utility bills to verify the primary residence. Such records must establish the permanent residence address, and not the mailing address, of the individual. Full-Benefit Dual Eligible Individual - For purposes of Medicare Prescription Drug benefits (Part D), is a Medicare beneficiary who is determined eligible by the state for medical assistance for full benefits under title XIX of the Social Security Act for the month under any eligibility category cove red under the State plan or comprehensive benefits under a demonstration under section 1115 of the Act, or medical assistance under section 1902(a)(10)(C) of the Act (medically needy) or section 1902(f) of the Act (States that use more restrictive eligibility criteria than are used by the SSI program) for any month if the individual was eligible for medical assistance in any part of the month. 13 Good Cause - This term refers to the standards established in \u00a7 60.3.4 under which an individual may be reinstated into his/her MA plan when involuntarily disenrolled for failure to pay the plan's premium or the Part D -Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (Part D -IRMAA) premium amount. Incarceration - This term refers to the status of an individual who is in the custody of a penal authority and confined to a correctional facility, such as a jail or prison , or a mental health institution as a result of a criminal offense. Such individual s reside outside of the service area for the purposes of MA plan eligibi lity, even if the correctional facility is located within the plan service area. Individuals who are confined to Institutions for Mental Disease (IMDs), such as state hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, or the psychiatric unit of a hospital, as a result of violations of the penal code, are incarcerated as CMS defines the term for the purpose of MA eligibility . The place of residence for these confined individuals is therefore excluded from the service area of a n MA plan on that basis. Individuals who are confined to IMDs, such as state hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, or the psychiatric unit of a hospital, for other reasons (e.g., because of court orders unrelated to penal violations ) are not incarcerated. Normal service area rules apply to these individual s. Institutionalized Individual - Please refer to 42 CFR 422.2. Involuntary Disenrollment - Disenrollments made necessary due to the organization's determination that the individual is no longer eligible to remain enrolled in a plan, or when an organization otherwise initiates disenrollment (e.g. failure to pay plan premiums, plan termination). Procedures regarding involuntary disenrollment are found in \u00a7 \u00a750.2 and 50.3. Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP) - An amount added to the MA -PD plan premium of an individual who did not obtain creditable prescription drug coverage when s/he was first eligible for Part D or who had a break in cr editable prescription drug coverage of at least 63 consecutive days. The LEP is considered a part of the plan premium. Lawfully Present Individual - Refer to 8 CFR 1.3 (Lawfully present aliens for purposes of applying for Social Security benefits) for a definition of an alien who is considered lawfully present in the United States. An individual who is not lawfully present in the Unites States is not e ligible for any federal public benefit, including payment of Medicare benefits. (8 U.S.C. 1611) Medicare Advantage Organization (MA organization) - Refer to Chapter 1 (General Provisions) for a definition of an \"MA organization.\" MA Organization Error - An error or delay in enrollment request processing made under the full control of the MA organization personnel and one that the organization could have avoided. Medicare Advantage Plan - Refer to Chapter 1 for a definition of \"MA plan.\" Enrollment reques ts are made at the MA plan level , not at the MA organization level. Other Low Income Subsidy (LIS) Eligible Individuals - For purposes of Medicare Part D benefits, individuals who are determined eligible for the Part D low -income subsidy (LIS) who are not full- benefit dual eligible individuals as defined above. This includes individuals deemed eligible for LIS by virtue of having QMB -only, SLMB -only, QI, SSI -only; as well as those who apply and are determined eligible for LIS. 14 Out-of-Area Members - Members of an MA plan who live outside the service area and who elected the MA plan while residing outside the service area (as allowed in \u00a7\u00a720.0, 20.3, 50.2.1, and 50.2.4). Part D -Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (Part D -IRMAA) - A premium amount separate from the Part D plan's monthly premium for individuals who have incomes over a certain amount. The Social Security Administration assesses the amount annually based on the enrollee's available tax information. The plan does not collect the Part D -IRMAA as part of its premium. Typically, individuals pay the Part D -IRMAA through their Social Security , Office of Personnel Management or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefit withholding . Some enrollees are directl y billed for their Part D -IRMAA through invoices sent by CMS or the RRB. All Part D enrollees who are assessed the Part D -IRMAA are required to pay the IRMAA even if the Part D coverage is provided through a n EGHP. Plan Performance Rating - A CMS -assigned rating, measured in stars from one to five, which indicates a n organization's quality and performance based on criteria established by CMS. A star rating of one star indicates poor performance, while a star rating of five stars indicates exemplary perfor mance. The Plan Performance Overall Rating (or \"overall rating\") is publicly available on Medicare.gov. CMS assigns the rating in October for the following year based on the organization's most recent quality and performance data. Potential At -risk Benef iciary - A Part D eligible individual who is identified as being potentially at - risk for misuse or abuse of a frequently abused drug in accordance with the requirements for drug management programs at 42 CFR 423.153(f). Additional guidance about Part D drug management programs is available at www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription -Drug - Coverage/PrescriptionDrugCo vContra/RxUtilization.htm (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) Receipt of Enrollment Request - MA organizations may receive enrollment requests through various means, as described in \u00a740.1. The MA organization must date as received all enrollment requests as soon as they are initially received. This date will be used to determine the election period in which the request was made, which in turn will determine the effective date of the request. Please refer to the definiti on of \"Application Date\" in this section for specific information regarding the correct date to report as the application date on enrollment transactions submitted to CMS. Reinstatement of Election - An action that may be taken by CMS to correct an errone ous disenrollment from an MA plan. The reinstatement corrects an indi vidual's records by canceling a disenrollment to reflect no gap in enrollment in an MA plan. A reinstatement may result in retroactive disenrollment from another Medicare managed care plan. Rejection of Enrollment Request - Occurs when CMS has rejected an enrollment request submitted by the MA organization. The rejection could be due to the MA organization incorrectly submitting the transactions, to system error, or to an individual's ineligibility to elect the MA plan. Special Needs Plan - Medicare Advantage coordinated care plans that serve the special needs of certain groups of individuals including; institutionalized individuals (as defined by CMS), those entitled to Medical Assistance under a State Plan under Title XIX and individuals with severe or disabling chronic conditions, as defined by CMS. 15 System Error - A \"system error\" is an unintended error or delay in enrollment request processing that is clearly attributable to a spec ific Federal government system (e.g., Social Security Administration (SSA) system, Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) system), and is related to Medicare entitlement information or other information required to process an enrollment request. Voluntary Disenr ollment - Disenrollment initiated by a member or his/her authorized representative. 16 20 - Eligibility for Enrollment in MA Plans 42 CFR 422.50 (Rev. 1, Issued: August 12, 2020; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2021) In general, an individual is eligible to elect an MA plan when each of the following requirements is met: 1. The individual is entitled to Medicare Part A and enrolled in Part B, provided that he or she will be entitled to receive services under Medicare Part A and Part B as of the effectiv e date of coverage under the plan (see exceptions described under \u00a720.6); 2. Effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, a beneficiary with ESRD can choose to join a MA plan. (For additional information on SNP eligibility criteria, see Chapter 16-B Special Needs Plans). 3. The individual permanently resides in the service area of the MA plan (see exceptions in \u00a720.3 for persons living outside the service area at the time of the enrollment request); 4. The individual is a U.S. citizen or lawfully present in the United States (see exceptions in \u00a720.3.2 for persons unlawfully present at the time of the enrollment request); 5. The individual or his/her legal representative completes an enrollment request and includes all the informat ion required to process the enrollment or meets alternative conditions for enrollment specified by CMS (refer to Appendix 2 for a list of items required to complete the enrollment form, and \u00a740.2.1 for who may sign enrollment request forms or complete othe r enrollment request mechanisms); 6. The individual is fully informed of and agrees to abide by the rules of the MA organization that were provided during the enrollment request; and 7. The individual makes a valid enrollment request that is received by t he plan during an election period, as described in \u00a730; 8. For a Special Needs Plan (SNP) additional requirements apply as described in \u00a720.11 of this guidance. 9. For an MSA plan, additional requirements apply as described in \u00a7 20.10 of this guidance. An MA organization may not impose any additional eligibility requirements as a condition of enrollment other than those established by CMS in this guidance. An MA organization must not deny enrollment to otherwise eligible individuals covered under an employee benefit plan. If the individual enrolls in an MA plan and continues to be enrolled in his/her employer/union or spouse's group health benefits plan, then coordination of benefits rules apply. An MA eligible individual may not be enrolled in more tha n one MA plan at any given time. Procedures for handling multiple transactions, cancellations, and reinstatements are described in \u00a7\u00a7 60.1, 60.2 and 60.3. 17 Individuals enrolled in an MA plan may not concurrently enroll in a PDP except for individuals enrolled in a Medicare MSA plan or individuals enrolled in a PFFS plan that does not offer Medicare prescription drug coverage. An individual enrolled in an MA PFFS plan that does not include a Part D benefit may enroll in a PDP, even if under the same MA contract the organization offers another PFFS plan that includes a Part D benefit. 20.1 - Entitlement to Medicare Parts A and B and Eligibility for Part D To be eligible to elect an MA plan, an individual must be entitled to Medicare Part A and enrolled in Part B, and must be entitled to Medicare Part A and Part B benefits as of the effective date of coverage under the plan. Exceptions for Part B -only \"grandfathered\" members are outlined in \u00a720.6. Part B only individuals currently enrolled in a plan creat ed under \u00a71833 or \u00a71876 of the Social Security Act (the Act) are not considered to be \"grandfathered\" individuals, and must purchase Medicare Part A through the Social Security Administration to become eligible to enroll in an MA plan. An MA organization has the option to continue to offer Part A -equivalent coverage to Medicare Part B-only \"grandfathered\" members, as described in \u00a720.6. However, an MA organization may not offer Part A -equivalent coverage to other individuals enrolled only in Medicare Part B (and not entitled to Part A) in order to make them \"eligible\" for enrollment in an MA plan. Eligibility requirements are met based on Part A entitlement through Medicare and not through the purchase of Part A -equivalent benefits through the MA organizati on. The MA organization may refer the individual to SSA if the individual wishes to enroll in Medicare Part A in order to be eligible to enroll in the MA plan. Eligibility for Part D does not exist: When the beneficiary is incarcerated. When the benefic iary is not lawfully present in the United States. When the beneficiary lives abroad. For any month prior to the month of notification of the entitlement determination when the entitlement determination for Part A and B is made retroactively. MA-PDs may not enroll an individual who is not eligible for Part D. 20.2 - Place of Permanent Residence 42 CFR 422.2 and 422.50(a)(3) (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) An individual is eligible to elect an MA plan if he or she permanently resides in the service area of the MA plan. A temporary move into the MA plan's service area does not enable the individual to elect the MA plan; the MA organization must deny such an enrollment request. Incarcerated individuals resid e outside of the plan service area for the purposes of MA eligibility, even if the correctional facility , institution or other place of confinement is located within the plan service area (see \u00a710 for definition of \"incarceration\") . 18 EXCEPTIONS An MA organiza tion may offer a continuation of enrollment option to MA local plan enrollees when they no longer reside in the service area of a plan and permanently move into the geographic area designated by the MA organization as a continuation area (refer to \u00a7 20.8 for more detail on the requirements for the continuation of enrollment option). Conversions: Individuals who are enrolled in a health plan of the MA organization and are converting to Medicare Parts A and B can elect an M A local plan offered by the same MA organization during their ICEP even if they reside in the MA organization's continuation area. (\"Conversion\" is defined in \u00a710 and the time frames for the ICEP are covered in \u00a730.2.) A member who was enrolled in an MA plan covering the area in which the member permanently resides at the time the plan was terminated in that area, may remain enrolled in the MA plan while living outside the plan's new reduced service area if: There is no other MA plan serving the area at that time; The MA organization offers this option; and The member agrees to receive services through providers in the MA plan's service area. The MA organization has the option to also allow individuals who are converting to Medicare Parts A and B to elect the MA plan during their ICEP even if they reside outside the service and continuation area. This option may be offered provided that CMS determines that all applicable MA acc ess requirements in 42 CFR 422.112 are met for that individual through the MA plan's established provider network providing services in the MA plan service area, and the organization furnishes the same benefits to the individual as to members who reside in the service area. The organization must apply the policy consistently for all individuals. These members will be known as \"out -of-area\" members. This option applies both to individual members and to employer or union sponsored group plan members of the MA organization. Individuals who do not meet the above requirements may not elect the MA plan. The MA organization must deny enrollment to these individuals. A permanent residence is normally the primary residence of an individual. Proof of permanent resid ence is normally established by the address of an individual's residence, but an MA organization may request additional information such as voter's registration records, driver's license records (where such records accurately establish current residence), tax records, and utility bills. Such records must establish the permanent residence address, and not the mailing address, of the individual. If an individual puts a Post Office Box as his/her place of residence on the enrollment form, the MA organization m ust contact the individual to confirm that the individual resides in the service area. If there is a dispute over where the individual permanently resides, the MA organization should determine whether, according to the law of the MA organization's State, t he person would be considered a resident of that State. In the case of homeless individuals, a Post Office Box, an address of a shelter or clinic, or the address where the individual receives mail (e.g., social security checks) may be considered the place of permanent residence. 19 MA organizations have the option to offer \"visitor\" or \"traveler\" programs for currently enrolled individuals who are consecutively out of the area for up to 12 months, provided the plan includes the full range of services availab le to other members (refer to \u00a750.2.1 for more detail on the requirements for the \"visitor/traveler\" option). Residence in an area designated for a \"visitor\" or \"traveler\" program does not make an individual eligible to enroll in an MA plan, but rather ap plies to already enrolled individuals. 20.2.1 - Mailing Address As described in \u00a720.3, an individual's eligibility to enroll in an MA plan is in part determined by the individual's permanent residence in the service area of that MA plan. Some individual s may have separate mailing addresses that may or may not be within the geographic plan service area. If an individual requests that mail be sent to an alternate address, such as that of a relative, MA organizations should make every effort to accommodate these requests, and should use this alternate address to provide required notices and other plan mailings, as appropriate. The model MA plan enrollment application forms provided in this guidance include a mechanism to collect a mailing address. Use of an alternate address does not eliminate or change the requirement of residency for the purposes of MA plan eligibility. 20.2.2 - U.S. Citizenship or Lawful Presence An individual is eligible to elect enrollment in a MA plan if he or she is a U.S. citizen or lawfully present in the United States. CMS will notify the MA organization if the individual is not eligible to enroll on this basis at the time of enrollment. The MA organization must deny an enrollment request from an individual who does not meet this requirement. EXCEPTION: In the case where CMS systems show that an individual will have lawful presence status on or before the enrollment effective date, the plan must accept and process the enrollment request. An MA organization must not deny an enrollment request on the basis that the applicant is not lawfully present at the time the request is received if CMS systems indicate that he or she will be lawfully present in the United States as of the enrollment effective date. If an individual provides evidence of their lawful pr esence status to the MA organization, the organization may not consider it when determining eligibility for enrollment. The organization may not request from an applicant any documentation of U.S. citizenship or alien status. CMS will provide the official status to the MA organization at the time of enrollment. However, if an individual has evidence of their lawful presence status and there is a dispute over their status, the MA organization should refer the individual to the Social Security Administratio n to have their status reviewed and adjusted, if necessary. 20.3 - Completion of Enrollment Request 42 CFR 422.50(a)(5) (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) The Medicare beneficiary (or their legal representative , as described in \u00a7 40.2.1) must complete an enrollment request in order to enroll in an MA plan, even if switching plans in the same MA organization. To consider an election complete, the individual must: Complete an enrollment request; 20 Provide required i nformation to the MA organization within the required time frames; and Submit the completed request to the MA organization during a valid enrollment period. This is required for all enrollments , unless otherwise specified by CMS. Individuals may use any of the enrollment mechanisms offered by the MA organization to make their enrollment request. See \u00a7 40.1 for more information on the types of enrollment mechanisms allowed. Individuals switching plans in the same MA organization may use a shortened enrollment form (sample Exhibit 3 or 3a). Individuals new to Medicare who are already a member of the organization's non-Medicare coverage (commercial, Medicaid, Marketplace) may use the simplified enrollment mechanism, if the MA organi zation chooses to offer it . An MA organization must deny enrollment to any individual who does not properly complete the enrollment form or other mechanism within required time frames. Procedures for completing the enrollment request are provided in \u00a740. 2 and Appendix 2. Refer to \u00a710 for a definition of \"completed enrollment request.\" 20.3.1 - Optional Employer/Union Enrollment Request Mechanism Beginning April 1, 2003, MA organizations that offer MA plans to an employer or union may choose to accept voluntary enrollment requests directly from the employer or union (or its Third Party Administrator (TPA)) without obtaining a paper MA enrollment request form from each individual. The enrollment requests repo rted to the MA organization by the employer/union will reflect the choice of retiree coverage individuals made using their employer's or union's process for selecting a health plan. This enrollment request mechanism is optional for MA organizations, and m ay not be required. Therefore, MA organizations may specify the employers and/or unions, if any, from which they will accept this enrollment request format and may choose to accept enrollment and/or voluntary disenrollment requests. The record of an indi vidual's choice of health plan submitted by the employer or union effectively replaces the paper MA enrollment request form(s). All eligibility, processing and notice requirements, as outlined in this guidance and other references, that pertain to paper enrollment request forms are applicable to this enrollment request mechanism; however, this process does not require the MA organiza tion to obtain a signature. Detailed information and instruction is provided in \u00a740.1.2 for enrollments and \u00a750.1.5 for disenr ollments. Notices of disenrollment, cancellation or termination of coverage not initiated by an enrollee enrollment request (i.e. involuntary disenrollment) are not included in this mechanism. Guidance for these situations is available in \u00a750.1.5. Addit ional information regarding employer/union sponsored group health plans can be found in Chapter 9 of this manual. 20.3.2 - Passive Enrollment by CMS 42 CFR 422. 60(g) (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) 21 Passive enrollment is a process where CMS enrolls an individual into another plan under certain circumstances specified below (note that CMS may also enroll individuals in plans under auto - and facilitated enrollment per \u00a7 40.1.5 and reassignment per \u00a7 40.1.8). The beneficiary receives a notice of this change and has the opportunity to accept or decline it. If the individual takes no action, the individual has made a choice to accept the enrollment. P assive enrollment s are permitted in specific, limite d circumstances associated with: Immediate plan terminations , Situations in which remaining enrolled in the plan would pose potential harm to members, and Situations where CMS determines passive enrollment is necessary to promote integrated care and cont inuity of care for full -benefit dual eligible beneficiaries. CMS will determine when p assive enrollment is appropriate under 42 CFR 422.60(g) and will initiate contact through the MA organization's CMS account manager . CMS will consult with the state Medicaid agency and may authorize passive enrollment for full -benefit dual eligible beneficiaries enrolled in an integrated dual-eligible special needs plan ( D-SNP) to continue access in integrated care, including when: The organization's Medicaid managed care plans non -renew because the state awards these contracts to another organization, or An integrated D -SNP non -renews at the end of the contract year. CMS will provide specific instructions directly to the affected organizations (both the plan losing t he member and the plan receiving the member) regarding processing the enrollments and specific information relevant to the situation for inclusion in notices. Notices: Organizations receiving passive enrollments must sen d required notices . The chart belo w outlines the requirements and timing: Passive enrollment due to immediate plan termination or potential harm to members Passive enrollment to continue access to integrated care 1 notice required 2 notices required Notice language must: describe the cos ts and benefits of the plan; outline the process for accessing care in the plan; and explain the ability to decline the enrollment or choose another plan, how to take that action and by when Each n otice language must: describe the costs and benefits of the plan; outline the process for accessing care in the plan; and explain the ability to decline the enrollment or choose another plan, how to take that action and by when Notice language must be approved by CMS Notice language must be approved by CMS Notice must be sent: prior to the date coverage in the plan begins; or as soon as possible after coverage in the plan begins, if prior notice isn't practical Notice must be sent: at least 60 calendar days prior to the date coverage in the plan begins; and at least 3 0 calendar days prior to the date coverage in the plan begins 22 Evaluation of Plans Receiving Passive Enrollments : For passive enrollment, CMS evaluates the receiving plan as noted in the following chart . Passive enrollment due to immediate plan termination or potential harm to members Passive enrollment to continue access to integrated care Key criteria CMS may use: Requirements (all must be met): Similar or lower out -of-pocket maximum Currently operate as a fully integrated dual eligible SNP (FIDE SNP) or qualify to meet Medicare-Medicaid integration criteria as D - SNP that meets a higher standard of integration (see Chapter 16 b) Similar or lower hospital cost -sharing amount Substantially similar provider and facility networks No additio nal network restrictions Substantially similar Medicare and Medicaid covered benefits Premium isn't significantly higher Have limits on premiums and cost -sharing that are appropriate for full -benefit dually eligible beneficiaries (CMS interprets this standard as having no premium or cost - sharing ($0) (see Chapter 16 b) Equivalent or higher value Part D benefit and formulary structure Have overall MA star rating of at least 3 stars (Exception: plan is low enrollment contract or new plan without star ratings) Similar Part B buy -down feature, if applicable Not under sanction for new enrollments Not under sanction for new enrollments Have capacity (and agree) to accept the enrollments Special Enrollment Period : An SEP is available to a ll individuals who are passively enrolled in addition to the ability to opt -out of a passive enrollment . This SEP allows the individual to make an election before the passive enrollment is effective in the receiving plan or after the coverage in the receiving plan start s. The SEP lasts 3 months beginning from the later of notice of a CMS or State -initiated enrol lment action or the enrollment effective date . See \u00a7 30.4.7 for more details about this SEP . NOTE: Individuals in non -renewing or terminating plans also have the ability to use other existing SEPs outlined in \u00a7 30. Dually- eligible individuals may also have the ability to use the duals SEP to switch plans, provided he or she meets the criteria for that election period (see \u00a7 30.4. 4 #5). When more than one SEP is available, the individual may use the SEP that provides him or her with the greatest flexibility to choose the plan that best meets his or her needs , but use of one SEP does not negate the avai lability of other SEPs if the beneficiary chooses to make a subsequent election (provided that the SEP hasn't expired and the individual still meets the SEP qualifying conditions) . 20.3.3 - Group Enrollment for Employer or Union Sponsored Plans CMS is providing a process for group enrollment into an employer/union sponsored MA plan. CMS will allow an employer or union to enroll its retirees using a group enrollment process in which the beneficiaries participate through advance notification and th at provides CMS with any information the 23 employer/union has on other insurance coverage for the purposes of coordination of benefits. MA organizations must adhere to the guidelines outlined in \u00a740.1.6, as well as all other program requirements, in developi ng and implementing this process. 20.4 - Agreeing to Abide by MA O rganization Rules 42 CFR 422.50(a)(6) Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) To be eligible to elect an MA plan , a beneficiary must be fully informed of and agree to abide by the rules of the MA organization that were provided during the enrollment process (refer to \u00a7\u00a7 40.4, 40.4.1, and 40.4.2 regarding what information must be provided to the individual during the enrollment process). \"Fully informed\" means that the individual must be provided with the applicable rules of the MA organization, as described in \u00a740.4.1 of this chapter, as well as in the Medicare Communications and Marketing Guidelines. The MA organization must deny enrollment to any individual who does not agree to abide by the rules of the MA organizati on. Agreement to abide by the rules of the MA organization in this context is made through the completion of the enrollment request. 20.5 - Grandfathering of Members on January 1, 1999 An individual who was enrolled on December 31, 1998, in an HMO with a risk contract under \u00a71876 of the Social Security Act was deemed to be enrolled on January 1, 1999, in an MA plan offered by the same organization if he/she did not choose to disenroll from the organizat ion effective on the latter date. This deemed enrollment applied even if the enrollee was not entitled to Medicare Part A or did not live in an MA plan service area or continuation area. The MA organization was not permitted to disenroll such individuals because they were not entitled to Part A, or did not live in the service or continuation area. However, if these individuals elect to disenroll from the MA organization, they are not eligible to enroll in any MA plan until or unless they meet all MA eligibi lity requirements. If enrollment in Medicare Part B ends for an individual, the individual may not continue as a member of the MA plan and must be disenrolled as described in \u00a7\u00a750.2.2 and 50.6. The MA organization must identify all Medicare Part B -only \"grandfathered\" individuals and inform them of their status annually. This notification may be included as part of the Evidence of Coverage. The notice must inform these individual s that if they disenroll from the MA organization, they cannot elect another MA plan unless they become entitled to Medicare Part A (by enrolling in Medicare Part A at SSA and by paying the appropriate premium to CMS) and remain enrolled in Medicare Part B . MA organizations may continue to provide Part A -equivalent benefits to Medicare Part B -only grandfathered members. In addition, if an MA organization offers Part A -equivalent coverage as a supplemental benefit in an MA plan, then the MA organization may disenroll a Medicare Part B -only grandfathered member who fails to pay the organization's Part A -equivalent premium, just as any member of the MA organization could be disenrolled for nonpayment of premiums (refer to \u00a7 50.3.1). Grandfathered members may enroll in other MA plans in the same MA organization (within the same State). However, if grandfathered members disenroll from the MA organization (i.e., they switch to Original Medicare), they will not be eligible to en roll in any MA plan in any MA organization until or unless they meet all MA eligibility requirements. If the out -of-area grandfathered members disenroll 24 from the MA organization (i.e., they switch to Original Medicare or attempt to enroll in another MA organization), they will only be able to enroll in other MA organizations if they meet all MA eligibility requirements, including, but not limited to, that of living in the service area of the MA plan. 20.6 - Eligibility and the Hospice Benefit An MA organi zation must not deny enrollment to any individual who has elected the hospice benefit (except in the case of a Medicare MSA plan; see \u00a720.10 for additional eligibility requirements for Medicare MSA plans). Until the MA organization acknowledges that it has received the completed enrollment request and gives a coverage effective date to the individual (refer to Exhibit 4 , Exhibit 4a , and \u00a740), the MA organization must not ask any questions related to the existence of a terminal illness or election of the hospice benefit. Such questions will be considered impermissible health screening. The MA organization may not disenroll any member on the basis of the member electing the hospice benefit either before or after becoming a member of the MA plan. 20.7 - Continuation of Enrollment Option for MA Local Plans With CMS approval, an MA organization may establish continuation areas, separate and apart from an MA local plan's serv ice area. Refer to Chapter 11 ( Medicare Advantage Application Procedures and Contract Requirements ) regarding CMS approval of continuation areas. As defined in\u00a710, the CMS - approved continuation area is an additional area outside an MA local plan's service area within which the MA organization furnishes or arranges for furnishing of services to the MA plan's members. Members may only choose to continue enrollment with the MA local pla n if they have permanently moved from the service area into the continuation area. As described in Chapter 11 , if an MA organization wants to offer a continuation of enrollment option under one or more of the MA local plans it offers, then it must obtain CMS' approval of the continuation area and the marketing materials that describe the continuation of enrollment option. The MA organization must also describe the enrollment option(s) i n member materials and make the option available to all members of the MA local plan in question who make a permanent move to the continuation area. An MA organization may require members to give advance notice of their intent to use the continuation of en rollment option. If the MA organization has this requirement, then it must fully describe the required notification process in the CMS -approved marketing materials. In addition, the MA organization must fully explain any continuation option to all potentia l members of the MA local plan, current members of any other health plan of the MA organization members who reside in the MA local plan service area and/or MA organization continuation area. If a member who permanently moves from the service area into the continuation area does not choose the continuation of enrollment option when he/she is eligible for the option, then the individual is no longer eligible to be a member of the MA local plan, and the MA organization must initiate the individual's disenroll ment. Procedures for continued enrollment are in \u00a760.8 and procedures describing disenrollment for permanent change of residence are described in \u00a750.2.1. 25 20.8 - Additional Eligibility Requirements for MA Religious Fraternal Benefit (RFB) Plans An MA RFB plan is a plan that an RFB society may offer only to members of the church, or convention or group of churches with which the society is affiliated. The requirement for membership can be met by any documentation establishing membership issued by the church, or by using the church's records of membership. An individual must also meet all the other requirements to elect an MA plan. 20.9 - Eligibility Requirements for Medicare Medical S avings Account (MSA) Plans There are additional requirements and limitations for individuals who wish to elect a Medicare Medic al Savings Account (MSA) plan. An individual is not eligible to elect a Medicare MSA plan if any one of the following applies: The individual will reside in the United States for fewer than 183 calendar days during the year in which the enrollment request is effective; The individual is enrolled in a Federal Employees Health Benefits program, or is eligible for health care benefi ts through the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Department of Defense; The individual is dual eligible and is entitled to coverage of Medicare premium and/or cost - sharing under a Medicaid State plan; The individual is receiving hospice benefits unde r the Medicare benefit prior to completing the enrollment request; or The individual receives health benefits that cover all or part of the annual Medicare MSA deductible such as through insurance primary to Medicare, supplemental insurance policies not specifically permitted under 42 CFR 422.104, or retirement health benefits. 20.10 - Additional Eligibility Requirements for Enrollment in MA Special Needs Plans MA Special Needs Plans (SNP) must limit enrollment to individuals who meet specified eligibility requirements in addition to the eligibility requirements in \u00a720 of this chapter. To be eligible for enrollment in a SNP an individual must meet the eligibility requirements for the specific SNP. Refer to Chapter 16 -B of the Medicare Managed Care Manual for additional information regarding special needs plan requirements. Before processing an enrollment into a dual eligible SNP (D -SNP), the SNP must confirm eligibility, including both MA eligibility and Medicaid eligibility. Acceptable proof of Medicaid eligibility can be a current Medicaid card, a letter from the state agency that confirms entitlement to Medical Assistance, or verification through a systems query to a State eligibility data system. The aforementioned documents or State systems verifications are acceptable proof of Medicaid entitlement for 26 beneficiaries resi ding in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Only where a state Medicaid agency requires a Social Security number to verify Medicaid status may the SNP enrollment request mechanism include a field for this element. An individual's current eligibilit y for the Medicare Part D Low Income Subsidy (LIS) or any other Medicaid status flag in CMS systems are not acceptable for initial or ongoing Medicaid eligibility verification for the purposes of determining dual eligible SNP eligibility. For current enrol lees, the SNP must verify continuing eligibility (e.g. full or partial dual status, as applicable) at least as often as the state Medicaid agency conducts re -determinations of Medicaid eligibility. Medicaid subset SNPs may enroll only those dual eligible individuals who meet all applicable MA eligibility requirements and are eligible to enroll in the organization's Medicaid managed care plan, as described in the organization's State contract. For enrollments into an institutional SNP (I -SNP), the organi zation must confirm that the individual requires an institutional (skilled nursing facility (SNF), nursing facility (NF), SNF/NF, intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded (ICF/MR) or inpatient psychiatric facility) level -of-care, and that the n eed for an institutional level -of-care has lasted 90 days or longer. When an institutional SNP opts to enroll special needs individuals prior to a 90 day length -of-stay, the needs -assessment (pre - approved by CMS) must show that the individual's condition m akes it likely that the length -of-stay (or need for an institutional level -of-care) will be at least 90 days. For enrollments into a chronic condition SNP (C -SNP), the organization must contact the provider or provider's office to confirm that the individual has the qualifying condition. The organization must obtain this information in one of the following two ways: 1) Contact the provider or provider's office and obtain verification of the condition prior to enrollment, or 2) Utilize a CMS -approved pre -enrollment qualification assessment tool prior to enrollment and obtain verification of the condition from the provider or provider's office on a post -enrollment basis. For either method, verification from the provider can be in the form of a note from a provider or the provider's office, or documented telephone contact with the provider or provider's office confirming that the individual has the condition. The organization may need to obtain written permission (separately from the enrollment form) permi tting it to contact the beneficiary's provider's office to obtain verification of the condition. If the organization chooses to use a CMS -approved prequalification assessment tool, it has until the end of the first month of enrollment to confirm that the enrollee has the qualifying condition necessary for enrollment into the severe/chronic disabling condition SNP. If it cannot confirm that the enrollee has the qualifying condition within that time, the organization has the first seven calendar days of the following month (i.e., the second month of enrollment) in which to send the beneficiary notice of his/ her disenrollment at the end of that month for not having t he qualifying condition. Disenrollment is effective at the end of the second month of enrollme nt; however, the organization must retain the member if confirmation of the qualifying condition is obtained at any point during the second month of enrollment . In the event the organization submits a disenrollment request to CMS prior to confirming the qualifying condition, a reinstatement request must be submitted to CMS (or its 27 designee). The beneficiary has an SEP that begins with the month of notification and continues through the two following months to enroll in another MA organization for a prospect ive effective date. This SEP allows a beneficiary time to find a new plan while reducing the potential for incurring a late enrollment penalty. EXAMPLE: A beneficiary submits a request to enroll in a SNP effective March 1st. The SNP uses a CMS -approved pr equalification assessment tool in February and attempts to confirm the beneficiary's special needs status but is unable to do so by March 31st. Between April 1st and April 7th (inclusive), the SNP must send a notice of prospective disenrollment to the bene ficiary indicating April 3 0th as the disenrollment date. If the beneficiary fails to select a new plan by April 30th, his/her SEP will continue through June 30th. S/he can enroll in a plan effective June 1st or July 1st. 28 30 - Election Periods and Effective Dates 42 CFR 422.62 & 422.68 (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) In order for an MA organization to accept an election , a valid request must be made during an election period (see \u00a710 for the definition of \"election\"). It is the responsibility of the organization to determine the election period of each enrollment or disenrollment request. To make this determination, the organization may need to contact the individual directly. The plan m ay incorporate specific statements regarding eligibility of an election period with the enrollment or disenrollment request (see Exhibit 1a for optional use with enrollment mechanisms ). However, if this information is not provided with the request, the plan must attempt to contact the individual by phone or other communication mechanism, and determine within the seven ( 7) day requirement if s/he is eligible to make an election at that tim e (see Exhibit s 5 & 11a) . Use of Exhibit 5 for the sole purpose of requesting information regarding an applicant's eligibility for an election period must include a due date that is no later than seven calendar days from the date the enrollment request was received. Enrollment requests the plan is not denying must be submitted to CMS within seven ( 7) calendar days of the plan's receipt of the completed enrollment request. (Section 40.3) Note : An organization's determination about an individual's eligibility for an election period is separate from a determination regarding whether an enrollment/disenrollment request is complete. See Section 40.2.2 for information pertaining to incomplete enrol lment requests. There are six types of election periods during which individuals may make enrollment requests. They are: Annual Election Period (AEP); Initial Coverage Election Period (ICEP); Initial Enrollment Period for Part D (IEP for Part D)1 Open Enrollment Period for Institutionalized Individuals (OEPI) Special Election Periods (SEP); and Medicare Advantage Open E nrollment Period ( MA OEP ) Unless a CMS -approved capacity limit or a CMS -issued enrollment sanction applies, all MA organizations must accept requests to enroll in their MA plans (with the exception of Medicare MSA plans) during the AEP, an ICEP, an IEP for Part D (MA -PD plans only) , the MA OEP and any SEP that allows enrollment into the specific plan. (Refer to \u00a730.7 for election periods for Medicare MSA plans.) When an MA plan is closed due to a capacity limit, the MA plan must remain closed to all 1 For MA, allows enrollment requests for MA -PD plans only.2 The employer/union establishes criteria for its retirees to participate in the employer/union sponsored MA plan. These criteria are exclusive of and in addition to the eligibility criteria for MA enrollment. Eligibility criteria to participate and receive employer/union sponsored benefits may include spouse/family status, payment to the employer/union of the individual's part of the premium, or other criteria determined by the employer/union. 29 prospective enroll ees (with the exception of reserved vacancies) until the limit is lifted. Refer to \u00a730.9 and \u00a730.9.1 for more information on OEP I plan closures, capacity limits and reserved vacancies. 30.1 - Annual Election Period (AEP) During the AEP, MA eligible individuals may enroll in or disenroll from an MA plan. The last enrollment request made, determined by the application date, will be the enrollment request that takes effect (refer to \u00a760.1 for information on multiple transactions). Beginning in 2011, t he AEP is from October 15 through December 7 of every year. The AEP is also referred to as the \"Fall Open Enrollment\" season and the \"Open Enrollment Period for Medicare Advantage AND Medicare prescription drug coverage\" in Medicare beneficiary publications and other tools. MA organizations may use these descriptions of the AEP in their member materials , as well as in materials for prospective members. Note: An e mployer/union sponsored MA plan may have an \"open season\" as determined by the employer. This may or may not correspond with the AEP. Therefore, org anization s are not required to accept enrollment requests into employer/ union plans during the AEP (unless the AEP and open season occur simultaneously); however, organizations must accept valid requests for disenrollment. 30.2 - Initial Coverage Election Period (ICEP) The ICEP is the period during which an individual newly eligible for MA may make an initial enrollment request to enroll in an MA plan. This period begins three months immediately before the individual's first entitlement to both Medicare Part A and Part B and ends on the later of: 1. The last day of the month preceding entitlement to both Part A and Part B, or; 2. The last day of the individual's Part B initial enrollment period. The initial enrollment period for Part B is the seven (7) month period that begins 3 months before the month an individual meets the el igibility requirements for Part B, and ends 3 months after the month of eligibility. See 42 CFR 407.14 for additional information. Once an ICEP enrollment request is made and enrollment takes effect, the ICEP election has been used. EXAMPLES Mrs. Donovan's 65th birthday is June 20, 2009. She is eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B beginning June 1, 2009 and has decided to enroll in Part B beginning on June 1. Her ICEP begins on March 1, 2009 and ends on September 30, 2009. Mrs. Smith's 65th birthday is April 20, 2008. She is eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B beginning April 1, 2008. Because she is still working and has health insurance provided by her employer, she has decided not to enroll in Part B during her initial enrollment perio d for Part B. Upon retiring, she will have the opportunity to enroll in Part B (through a Part B SEP). She has 30 enrolled in Part B effective May 1, 2009. Her ICEP would be February 1 through April 30, 2009. Please note that the ICEP for an MA enrollment election will frequently relate to either the individual's 65th birthday or the 25th month of disability, but it must always relate to the individual's entitlement to both Medicare Part A and Part B. When an individual enrolls in an MA -PD plan, s/he has used both the ICEP and the IEP for Part D (see \u00a730.2.1). 30.2.1 - Initial Enrollment Period for Part D (IEP for Part D) The Initial Enrollment Period for Part D (IEP for Part D) is the period during which an individual is first eligible to enroll in a Part D plan. In general, an individual is eligible to enroll in a Part D plan when he or she is entitled to Part A OR is enrolled in Part B, AND permanently resides in the s ervice area of a Part D plan. Ultimately, CMS provides a part D eligibility effective date and maintains it in CMS systems. At the beginning of the Medicare prescription drug coverage program, all current Part D eligible individuals had an IEP for Part D that began on November 15, 2005, and ended on May 15, 2006. During the IEP for Part D, individuals may make one Part D enrollment choice, including enrollment in an MA -PD plan. Generally, individuals will have an IEP for Part D that is the same period a s the Initial Enrollment Period for Medicare Part B. The initial enrollment period for Part B is the seven (7) month period that begins 3 months before the month an individual meets the eligibility requirements for Part B, and ends 3 months after the mont h of eligibility. See 42 CFR 407.14 for additional information. EXAMPLE: Mr. Hackerman's 65th birthday is March 23, 2010. He is currently working, and while he signed up for his Medicare Part A benefits, effective March 1, 2010, he declined his enrollm ent in Part B, given his working status. He is eligible for Part D since he has Part A and lives in the service area. Even though he did not enroll in Part B, his Part B IEP is still the 3 months before, the month of, and the 3 months following his 65th birthday - that is, December 2009 - June 2010. Hence, his IEP for Part D is also December 2009 - June 2010. Individuals not eligible to enroll in a Part D plan at any time during their initial enrollment period for Medicare Part B have an IEP for Part D that is the 3 months before becoming eligible for Part D, the month of eligibility, and the three months following eligibility for Part D. EXAMPLE: Mr. Duke lived in Italy at the time of his 65th birthday, which occurred on August 3, 2008. His Part B initial enrollment period began on May 1, 2008, and ended November 30, 2008. He plans to return to the U.S. to reside permanently in June 2010. Since he lived out of the U.S. and was not eligible to enroll in a Part D plan during his IEP for Part B, his initial enrollment period for Part D will occur when he meets all the eligibility requirements for Part D, that is, when he has Part A or B and resides in a Part D plan service area. His IEP for Pa rt D is March 2010 - September 2010. Individuals eligible for Medicare prior to age 65 (such as for disability) will have another Initial Enrollment Period for Part D based upon attaining age 65. 31 The ICEP and the IEP for Part D occur together as one pe riod when a newly Medicare eligible individual has enrolled in BOTH Part A and B at first eligibility. Should an individual delay enrollment in Part B to a later time, the ICEP and IEP for Part D become separate with the ICEP changing to then occur as the 3 months immediately preceding entitlement to BOTH parts A and B. If a Medicare entitlement determination is made retroactively eligibility for Part D begins with the month in which the individual received notification of the retroactive entitlement deci sion. Therefore, the Part D IEP begins the month the individual receives the notice of the Medicare entitlement determination and continues for three additional months after the month the notice is provided. The effective date is generally the first day o f the month after the organization receives a completed enrollment request. In MA context, the IEP for Part D applies only to MA -PD enrollment requests. Accordingly, when an applicant has both the ICEP and IEP for Part D available to him/her, the organiza tion must submit the transaction to CMS as an IEP for Part D election. Refer to Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual for additional information regarding Part D election periods. 30.3 - Open Enrollment Period for Institutionalized I ndividuals (OEPI) The OEPI is continuous for eligible individuals. For purposes of enrollment under the OEPI election period, an institutionalized individual is defined as an individual who moves into, resides in, or moves out of an institution, as define d in \u00a710. The OEPI ends two months after the month the individual moves out of the institution. Special Note for SNP enrollment: In addition, the OEPI is available for individuals who meet the definition of \"institutionalized\" to enroll in or disenroll f rom an MA SNP for institutionalized individuals. An MA eligible institutionalized individual can make an unlimited number of MA enrollment requests during the OEPI . An MA organization is not required to accept requests to enroll into its plan during the O EPI, but if it is open for these enrollment requests, it must accept all OEPI requests to enroll into the plan. Since the OEPI is continuous for eligible individuals, Original Medicare is also open continuously. Therefore, MA organizations must accept req uests for disenrollment from their MA plans during the OEPI whether or not the MA plan is open to accept enrollment . Please note the definition of \"institution\" here differs from that used in determining when an institutionalized full -benefit dual eligibl e qualifies for the low -income subsidy copayment level of zero. 30.4 - Special Election Period (SEP) 42 CFR 422.62(b) (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) Special election periods constitute periods outside of the usual IEP, AEP or MA OEP when an individual may elect a plan or change his or her current plan election. As detailed below, there are various types of SEPs, including SEPs for dual eligibles, and f or individuals whose current plan 32 terminates, who change residence and who meet \"exceptional conditions\" as CMS may provide, consistent with \u00a71851(e)(4) of the Act and \u00a7422.62(b) of the MA regulations. Depending on the nature of the particular special el ection period, an individual may: Discontinue an enrollment in an MA plan and enroll in Original Medicare Switch from Original Medicare to an MA plan Switch from one MA plan to another MA plan Certain SEPs are limited to an enrollment or disenrollment re quest. If the individual disenrolls from (or is disenrolled from) the MA plan and changes to Original Medicare, the individual may subsequently elect a new MA plan within the SEP time period. Once the individual has elected the new MA plan, the SEP ends fo r that individual even if the time frame for the SEP is still in effect. In other words, the SEP for the individual ends when the individual elects a new MA plan or when the SEP time frame ends, whichever comes first , unless specified otherwise within an SEP. Note: An individual's eligibility for an SEP provides an opportunity to make an election but does not convey eligibility to enroll in the plan; an individual must also meet all applicable MA eligibility criteria. It is generally the responsibility o f the organization to determine whether the individual is eligible for an SEP. The exception to this determination requirement would be enrollment and disenrollment requests completed or approved by CMS staff. To make this determination, the organization may need to contact the individual directly . The plan may incorporate specific statements regarding eligibility of an SEP with the enrollment or disenrollment request (see Exhibit 1a for optional use with enrollment mechanisms and Exhibit 10a for optional use with disenrollment forms ). However, if this information is not provided with the request, the plan must contact the individual to determine if they are eligible to make an election at that time. Unless stated otherwise in this guidance, the organiza tion MUST accept an individual's verbal or written confirmation regarding the conditions that make him or her eligible for the SEP. Determination of eligibility for some SEPs requires that the organization obtain the date on which the individual's circumst ances changed (i.e. change in residence, loss of special needs status, etc.). Organizations that obtain this information on the enrollment or disenrollment request are not required to obtain an additional verbal or written confirmation of SEP eligibility. For enrollment requests obtained during a face -to-face interview or telephone request, the determination of SEP eligibility can be made at that time. For enrollment requests made using paper, or via an electronic enrollment mechanism or the Medicare O EC (without accompanying CMS approval), the organization is not required to contact the applicant to confirm SEP eligibility if the enrollment request includes the applicant's attestation of SEP eligibility. If SEP eligibility is obtained orally (by phon e or in person), the organization must document this contact and retain this information with the enrollment or disenrollment record. If the organization obtains this confirmation through a written notice, such notice must afford the beneficiary the optio n of calling the organization and confirming this information verbally. If the organization is not able to obtain SEP eligibility information from the applicant, the organization must deny the enrollment or disenrollment request and provide the individual a denial notice (see Exhibit 7). The following are examples of questions that might be used to determine eligibility for an SEP: 33 Type of SEP? Examples of Questions Change in Residence Have you recently moved? If so, when? Where did you move from? Employer/Union Group Health Plan (EGHP) Do you currently have (or are leaving) coverage offered by an employer or union? Have you recently lost such coverage? Disenroll from Part D to Enroll in Creditable Coverage Are you a member of TriCare? Do you have or want to obtain VA benefits? Full Dual Eligible or Other Low Income Subsidy Do you currently have Medicaid coverage? Does your state pay for your Medicare premiums? Do you receive SSI cash benefits without Medicaid? Did you receive a letter from Medicare letting you know that you automatically qualify for extra help? How much do you pay for your prescriptions? Retroactive notice of Medicare entitlement Have you recently received a notice telling you that you have been approved for Medicare for a \"retroactive\" date? If so, when did you receive this notice? PACE For enrollment - are you currently enrolled in a special plan called \"PACE\"? CMS/State Assignment Have you recently received a blue letter (i.e., Reassignment notice ) from Medicare? Did your state/plan send you a letter to let you know they are moving you to a different plan? Did you recently receive a yellow letter (i.e., Auto - enrollment notice ) from Medicare ? Have you recently received a green letter (i.e., Facilitated Enrollment notice ) from Medicare ? Change in Dual/LIS Status Have you recently gained/ lost coverage under Medicaid? Did you recently receive a grey letter (i.e., Loss of Deemed Status notice) from Medicare ? Did you recently receive an orange letter (i.e., Change in Extra Help Co -Payment notice) from Medicare? Did you recently receive a purple letter (i.e., Deemed Status notice) from Medicare? Please note that the time frame of an SEP denotes the time frame during which an individual may make an enr ollment or disenrollment request. It does not necessarily correspond to the effective date of coverage. For example, if an SEP exists for an individual from May - July, then an MA organization must receive an enrollment request from that individual sometim e between May 1 and July 31 in order to consider the enrollment request an SEP enrollment request. However, the type of SEP will dictate what the effective date of coverage may be. 34 Individuals who disenroll from an MA plan to Original Medicare during an S EP may be provided Medigap guaranteed issue rights. These rights are not afforded to those individuals who enroll into an MA plan during an SEP. MA organizations are required to notify members of these guaranteed issue rights when members disenroll to Orig inal Medicare during a SEP. See \u00a7\u00a750.1.7 and 50.2 for the additional information regarding these notification requirements The time frames and effective dates for SEPs are discussed in the following sections. SEPs apply to local and regional MA plans unless otherwise spec ifically stated. Corresponding Part D SEPs are provided in separate PDP Enrollment guidance. 30.4.1 - SEPs for Changes in Residence An SEP for a change in residence exists for these scenarios: 1) individuals who are no longer eligible to be enrolled in an MA plan due to a change in permanent residence outside of the MA plan service area; 2) individuals who were not eligible for MA because they were incarcerated and have now been released, or; 3) individuals who will have new Medicare health or Part D plans available to them as a result of a permanent move. The SEP permits enrollment elections only; it begins on either the date of the permanent move or on the d ate the individual provides notification of such move . Since individuals who do not permanently reside in the plan service area are ineligible for the plan and must be disenrolled, a SEP is not needed to effectuate an involuntary disenrollment for that reason (see \u00a750.2.1) . Individuals who move and have new Medicare health or Part D plans available to them as a result of the move, but continue to reside in the current plan service area, may use this SEP to enroll in any MA or Part D plan for which they are eligible in their new place of residence. It is the individual's responsibility to notify the MA organization that he/she is permanently moving. When the individual notifies the organization of a permanent move o ut of the plan service area, the SEP begins either the month before the individual's permanent move, if the individual notifies the organization in advance, or the month the individual provides the notice of the move, if the individual has already moved. T he SEP continues for two months following the month it begins or the two months following the month of the move, whichever is later. If the organization learns from CMS or another source (as described in \u00a750.2.1.3) that the individual has been out of the service area for over six months and the organization has not been able to confirm otherwise with the individual, the SEP starts at the beginning of the sixth month and continues through to the end of the eighth month. The enrollment effective date is de termined by the date the MA organization receives the enrollment request . The individual may choose an effective date of up to three months after the month in which the MA organization receives the enrollment request . However, the effective date may not be earlier than the date the individual moves to the new service area and the MA organization receives the enrollment request. 35 EXAMPLE 1 A beneficiary is a member of an MA plan in Florida and intends to move to Arizona on June 18. A SEP exists for this beneficiary from May 1 - August 31. A. If an MA organization in Arizona receives an enrollment request from the beneficiary in May, the beneficiary can choose an effective date of July 1, August 1, or September 1. B. If the MA organization receives the e nrollment request from the beneficiary in June (the month of the move), the beneficiary can choose an effective date of July 1, August 1, or September 1. C. If the MA organization receives the enrollment request in July, the beneficiary could choose an ef fective date of August 1, September 1, or October 1. EXAMPLE 2 A beneficiary resides in Florida and is currently in Original Medicare and not enrolled in an MA plan. The individual intends to move to Maryland on August 3. An SEP exists for this benefic iary from July 1 through October 31. At the time the individual makes the enrollment request into an MA plan, the individual must provide the specific address where the individual will permanently reside upon moving into the service area, so that the MA organization can determine that the individual meets the residency requirements for enrollment in the plan. Disenrollment from Previous MA Plan Please keep in mind that a member of an MA plan who moves permanently out of the service area must be involun tarily disenrolled from the plan, unless continuation of enrollment applies. A member of an MA plan who is out of the service area for more than six months must be involuntarily disenrolled from the plan. CMS has established an SEP that allows an individual adequate time to choose a new MA plan, given the fact that the individual will no longer be enrolled in the original MA plan after the month of the move or after the sixth month (whichever is appropriate). Unless an individual enrolls in a new M A plan with an effective date of the month after the move or the beginning of the seventh month (e.g., the individual moves on June 18 and enrolls in a new plan effective July 1), he/she will be enrolled in Original Medicare until he/she elects the new MA plan during a valid enrollment period. If the individual had Part D coverage and lost it due to the involuntary disenrollment, s/he may be subject to a Part D late enrollment penalty (LEP). See Chapter 4 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Manual for more in formation . 30.4.2 - SEPs for Contract Violation In the event an individual is able to demonstrate to CMS that the MA organization offering the MA plan of which he/she is a member substantially violated a material provision of its contract under MA in rel ation to the individual, or the MA organization (or its agent) materially misrepresented the plan when marketing the plan, the individual may disenroll from the MA plan and elect Original Medicare 36 or another MA plan. The SEP will begin once CMS determines that a violation has occurred. Its length will depend on whether the individual immediately elects a new MA plan upon disenrollment from the original MA plan or whether the individual initially elects Original Medicare before choosing a new MA plan. We no te that in some case -specific situations, CMS may process a retroactive disenrollment for these types of disenrollments. If the disenrollment is not retroactive: A SEP exists such that an individual may elect another MA plan or Original Medicare during the last month of enrollment in the MA organization, for an effective date of the month after the month the new MA organization receives the enrollment request. EXAMPLE On January 16, CMS determines, based on a member's allegations, that the MA organizatio n substantially violated a material provision of its contract. As a result, the member will be disenrolled from the MA plan on January 31. A SEP exists for this beneficiary beginning January 16 and lasting until the end of January. The beneficiary promptly applies for a new MA plan, and the new MA organization receives the enrollment form on January 28 for a February 1 effective date. If the individual in the above example elected Original Medicare during the last month of enrollment in the MA organization (either by choosing Original Medicare or by not choosing an MA plan and therefore defaulting to Original Medicare), the individual will be given an additional 90 calendar days from the effective date of the disenrollment from the MA organization to elect another MA plan. During this 90-day period, and until the individual elects a new MA plan, the individual will be enrolled in Original Medicare. The individual may choose an effective date into a new MA plan beginning any of the three months after the mont h in which the MA organization receives the enrollment request. However, the effective date may not be earlier than the date the MA organization receives the enrollment request. EXAMPLE On January 16, CMS determines, based on a member's allegations that the MA organization substantially violated a material provision of its contract. The member decides to return to Original Medicare. As a result, the member is disenrolled from the MA plan on January 31 and enrolled in Original Medicare with a February 1 ef fective date. A 90 -day SEP continues to exist for the beneficiary from February 1 through April 30. In this example, a new MA organization then receives an enrollment request from the individual on April 15. The beneficiary can choose an effective date of May 1, June 1, or July 1. If the disenrollment is retroactive, CMS will provide the beneficiary with the time frame for his/her SEP to elect another plan on a case -by-case basis. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the contract violation, CMS may d etermine a retroactive enrollment into another MA plan is warranted. 30.4.3 - SEPs for Non -renewals or Terminations In general, SEPs are established to allow members affected by non -renewals or terminations ample time to elect a new plan. Effective dates during these SEPs are described below. CMS has the 37 discretion to modify this SEP as necessary for any non -renewals or terminations when the circumstances are unique and warrant a modified SEP. Non-renewals - A SEP exists for members of MA plans that will be affected by plan or contract non-renewals and plan service area reductions that are effective January 1 of the con tract year. In order to provide sufficient time for members to evaluate their options, the SEP begins December 8 and ends on the last day in February of the following year. Enrollment requests received from December 8 through December 31 will have an effective date of January 1. Enrollment requests received in January will have an effective date of February 1. Enrollment requests received in February will have an effective date of March 1. MA organization Termination of Contract and Terminations/Co ntract Modifications by Mutual Consent - A SEP exists for members of plans who will be affected by a termination of contract by the MA organization or a modification or termination of the contract by mutual consent (42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7422.512 and 422.508(a)(1)) . The SEP begins two months before the proposed termination effective date, and ends one month after the month in which the termination occurs. Please note that if an individual does not elect an MA plan before the termination effective date, he/she will be defaulted to Original Medicare on the effective date of the termination. However, the SEP will still be in effect for one month after the effective date o f the termination should the individual wish to subsequently elect an MA plan (for a current, not retroactive, effective date). Beneficiaries affected by these types of terminations may request an effective date of the month after notice is given, or up t o two months after the effective date of the termination. However, the effective date may not be earlier than the date the new MA organization receives the enrollment request. EXAMPLE If an MA organization contract terminates for cause on April 30, an SE P lasts from March 1 through May 31. In this scenario, a beneficiary could choose an effective date of April 1, May 1, or June 1; however, the effective date may not be earlier than the date the new MA organization receives the enrollment request. CMS Ter mination of MA organization Contract - A SEP exists for members of plans that will be affected by MA organization contract terminations by CMS (42 CFR 422.510) . The SEP begins 1 month before the terminati on effective date and ends 2 months after the effective date of the termination. Please note that if an individual does not elect an MA plan before the termination effective date, he/she will be defaulted to Original Medicare on the effective date of the termination. However, the SEP will still be in effect for two months after the effective date of the termination should the individual wish to subsequently elect an MA plan (for a current, not retroactive, effective date). Beneficiaries affected by these types of terminations may select an effective date of up to three months after the month of termination. However, the effective date may not be earlier than the date the new MA organization receives the enrollment request. 38 EXAMPLE If CMS terminates an M A organization contract effective June 30, an SEP lasts from June 1 through August 31. In this scenario, a beneficiary could choose an effective date of July 1, August 1, or September 1; however, the effective date may not be earlier than the date the new MA organization receives the enrollment request. Immediate Terminations By CMS - CMS will establish the SEP during the termination process for immediate terminations by CMS (42 CFR 422.510(b)(2)) , where CMS provides notice of termination to an MA plan's members and the termination may be mid -month. Note: Approved plan consolidations are neither terminations nor non- renewals . Thus individuals affected by plan consolidations are not eligible for the SEP for non -renewals or terminations. Please see the annual CMS Call Letter and other CMS end-of-year guidance for more information about approved plan consolidations. 30.4.4 - SEPs for Exceptional Conditions 42 CFR 422.62(b)(4) (Rev. 2, Issued: August 12, 2020; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2021) CMS has the legal authority to establish SEPs when an individual or group of individuals meets exceptional conditions specified by CMS, including on a case -by-case basis. The SEPs C MS has established include: 1. SEP EGHP (Employer/Union Group Health Plan) 42 CFR 422.62(b)(4) An SEP exists for individuals making MA enrollment requests into or out of employer sponsored MA plans, for individuals to disenroll from an MA plan to take employer sponsored coverage of any kind, and for individuals disenrolling from employer sponsored coverage (including COBRA coverage) to elect an MA plan. The SEP EGHP may be used when the EGHP allows the individual to make changes in their health coverage choices, such as during the employer's or union's \"open season,\" or at other times the employer or union allows. This SEP is available to individuals who have (or are enrolling in) an employer or union sponsored plan and ends 2 months after the month the employer or union coverage ends. The individual may choose an effective date of up to three months after the month in which the individual completed an enrollment or disenrollment request ; however, the effective date may not be earlier than the first of the month following the month in which the request was made. The effective date also may not be earlier than the first day of the individual's entitlement to both Medicare Part A and Part B. NOTE: If necessary due to the employer 's or union's delay in for warding the completed enrollment request to the MA organization, the MA organization may process the enrollment request with a retroactive effective date, as outlined in \u00a760.6. Keep in mind that all MA eligible individu als, including those in EGHPs, may elect MA plans during the AEP and ICEP and during any other SEP. The SEP EGHP does not eliminate the right of these individuals to make enrollment requests during these election periods . 39 Refer to \u00a730.6 for additional information for situations in which an individual is determined eligible for more than one election period, one of which includes the SEP EGHP. 2. SEP for Individuals Who Disenroll in Connection with a CMS Sanction 42 CFR 422.62(b)(5) On a case by case basis, CMS will establish an SEP for individuals enrolled in an MA plan offered by an MA organization that has been sanctioned by CMS who elect to disenroll in connection with the matter that gave rise to that sanction. The start/length of the SEP, as well as the effective date, is dependent upon the situation. The SEP starts with the imposition of the sanction and ends when the sanction ends or when the individual makes an election, whichever occurs first . CMS may require t he MA organization to notify current enrollees that if the enrollees believe they are affected by the matter(s) that gave rise to the sanction, the enrollees are eligible for a SEP to elect another MA plan or disenroll to original Medicare and enroll in a PDP. 3. SEP for Individuals Enrolled in Cost Plans that are Non -renewing their Contracts 42 CFR 422.62(b)(6) An SEP will be available to Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in an HMO or CMP under a \u00a71876 cost contract that will no longer be offered in the area in which the beneficiary resides. Beneficiaries electing to enroll in an MA plan via this SEP must meet MA eligibility requirements. This SEP begins December 8 of the current contract year an d ends on the last day of February of the following year. Enrollment requests received from December 8 through December 31 will have an effective date of January 1. Enrollment requests received in January will have an effective date of February 1. Enrollm ent requests received in February will have an effective date of March 1. 4. SEP for Individuals in the Program of All -inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) 42 CFR 422.62(b)(7) Individuals may disenroll from an MA plan at any time in order to enroll in PACE. In addition, individuals who disenroll from PACE have an SEP to elect an MA plan. The SEP ends 2 months after the effective date of PACE disenrollment. 5. SEP for Dual -elig ible Individuals and Other LIS- Eligible Individuals - 42 CFR 423.38(c)(4) (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) There is an SEP for individuals who have Medicare Part A and Part B and receive any type of assistance from t he Title XIX (Medicaid) program. This includes both \"full benefit\" dual eligible individuals as well as individuals often referred to as \"partial duals\" who receive cost sharing assistance under Medicaid (e.g. QMB -only, SLMB -only, etc .) and individuals who qualify for LIS (but who do not receive Medicaid benefits) . 40 This SEP begins the month the individual becomes dually-eligible and exists as long as he or she receives Medicaid benefits ; however there are limits in how often it can be used . This SEP allows an individual to enroll in, or disenroll from, an MA plan once per calendar quarter during the first nine months of the year . This SEP can be used once during each of the following time periods: January - March, April - June, and July - September . It may not be used in the 4th quarter of the year (October - December). The SEP is considered \"used\" based on the month in which the individual makes the election (i.e., application date of the enrollment request) . If the plan receives an election in Ma rch (which would be effective April 1st), this counts as \"using\" the SEP for the 1st quarter, not the 2nd quarter. The effective date of an enrollment request made using this SEP is the first of the month following receipt of an enrollment request. NOTES : As described in \u00a7 40.1.5, the effective date for auto -enrollments of full -benefit dual -eligible individuals may be retroactive. Organizations need to check for prior uses of the SEP via the BEQ or MARx UI to determine eligibility. CMS will reject enrollment transactions for individuals who have already used this SEP in the calendar quarter. Use of this SEP is separate from, and in addition to, the SEPs outlined in #12 in this section (SEP for Individuals who Lose or Have a Change in their Dual or LIS -Eligible Status ) and \u00a7 30.4.7 (SEP for Individuals Who Have Been Enrolled into a Plan by CMS or the State) . If a dual or other -LIS eligible beneficiary is making an election and is also eligible for another SEP, the organization should use the other S EP instead of this SEP. Limitation for \"At -Risk\" and \" Potential At-Risk\" Beneficiaries : Once an individual is identified by the MA -PD organization as a \" potential at -risk\" or \"at-risk\" beneficiary and the plan sponsor has sent written notice to the individual , he or she cannot use this SEP to change plans while this designation is in place . The notice to the individual explains that this SEP is no longer available. Additional information on drug management programs is available at www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription -Drug -Coverage/PrescriptionDrugCovContra/RxUtilization.html Duration of Limitation - This limitation starts as of the date on the initial notice provided to the \"potential at -risk\" beneficiary. The chart below outlines when the limitation ends : Situation SEP limitation ends Plan decides not to identify the \"potential at - risk\" beneficiary as an \"at -risk\" bene ficiary 60 days from the date on the initial notice , or t he date the beneficiary receives notice of the plan's decision , if earlier . The \" potential at -risk\" or \"at-risk\" beneficiary identification is subsequently removed by the The date that the designation is removed by the plan or upon effectuation of a favorable appeal 41 Situation SEP limitation ends plan or through beneficiary's favorable appeal of an \"at -risk\" determination The plan determines the beneficiary is \"at-risk\" 12 months from the date the individual is deter mined to be \"at-risk\" The plan extends the \"at -risk\" designation beyond the initial 12 months 24 months from the date the individual is determined to be \"at -risk\" NOTE: This is the maximum consecutive time the SEP limitation can be imposed for each \"at - risk\" limitation a sponsor implements. The limitation ends based on whichever situation occurs first. If a plan sponsor removes the individual 's status as an \"at -risk\" beneficiary or the designation expires, the plan may subsequently determine that the individual is \"potentially at -risk\" again , in accordance with the requirements for drug management programs in 42 CFR 423.153(f)(1). Consequently, the SEP would, once again, not be available to the individual based on the date the plan sends the new n otification . For more information on \"potentially . NOTE: Organizations need to check for this designation via the BEQ or MARx UI to determine eligibility. The enrollment limitation for a \"potential at -risk\" or an \"at-risk\" individual will not apply to other Part D enrollment periods, including the AEP or other SEPs . 6. SEP for Individuals Who Terminated a Medigap Policy When They Enrolled For the First Time in an MA Plan, and Who Are Still in a \"Trial Period\" 42 CFR 422.62(b)(8) For Medicare beneficiaries who terminated a Medigap policy when they enrolled for the first time in an MA plan, \u00a71882(s)(3)(B)(v) of the Act provides a guaranteed right to purchase another Medigap policy if they disenroll from the MA plan while they are still in a \"trial period.\" In most cases, a trial period lasts for 12 months after a person enrolls in an MA plan for the first tim e. This SEP is for individuals who are eligible for \"guaranteed issue\" of a Medigap policy under \u00a71882(s)(3)(B)(v) of the Act upon disenrollment from the MA plan in which they are enrolled. This SEP all ows a qualified individual to make a one -time election to disenroll from their first MA plan to join Origina l Medicare at any time of the year. The SEP begins upon enrollment in the MA plan and ends after 12 months of enrollment or when the beneficiary dis enrolls from the MA plan, whichever is earlier. 7. SEP for Individuals with ESRD Whose Entitlement Determination Made Retroactively 42 CFR 422.62(b)(9) If a Medicare entitlement determination is made for a retroactive effective date , an individual has n ot been provided the opportunity to elect an MA plan during his/her ICEP. Therefore, these individuals will be allowed to elect an MA plan for a prospective effective date. This would also be allowed in cases when there is an administrative delay and the entitlement determination is not made timely. For example, an individual who performs self -dialysis will have 42 his/her entitlement date adjusted to begin at the time of dialysis, rather than the customary 3 -month period AFTER dialysis begins. The SEP begin s the month the individual receives the notice of the retroactive Medicare entitlement determination and continues for 2 additional calendar months after the month the notice is received. The enrollment effective date is the first day of the month after th e MA plan receives the enrollment request. This SEP is not available after December 31, 2020. 8. SEP for Individuals Whose Medicare Entitlement Determination Made Retroactively 42 CFR 422.62(b)(10) If a Medicare entitlement determination is made for a retroactive effective date , an individual has not been provided the opportunity to elect an MA plan during his/her ICEP. Therefore, these individuals will be allowed to elect an MA plan for a prospective effective date. This would also be allowed in cases when there is an administrative delay and the entitlement determination is not made timely by SSA and/or received by the individual in a timely manner . The SEP begins the month the individual receives the notice of the retroactive Medicare entitlement determination and continues for two additional calendar months after the month the notice is received. The effective date is the first day of the month after the MA plan receives the enrollment request . 9. MA SEPs to Coordinate With Part D Enrollment Period s - Individuals eligible for an enrollment period under the guidance for Part D enrollment and disenrollment may use that SEP to make an election into or out of an MA -PD plan (as applicable). Most Part D SEPs are duplicated in the MA program as described a bove; however, those that are not described elsewhere are provided here: A. Involuntary loss of creditable coverage, including a reduction in the level of coverage so that it is no longer creditable, not including any such loss or reduction due to a failure to pay premiums. The SEP permits enrollment into a n MA -PD and begins when the individual is advised of the loss of (or reduction in) creditable coverage . The SEP ends two calendar months after either the loss (or reduction) occurs or the individual received notice, whichever is later. The effective date of this SEP is the first of the month after the election is made or, at the beneficiary's request, may be up to 3 months prospective. (42 CFR 422.62(b)(19)) B. Individuals who are not adequately informed of a loss of creditable coverage, or that they never had creditable coverage, have an SEP that permits one enrollment in, or disenrollment from, a n MA-PD plan. CMS determines eligibility for this on a case -by-case basis , based on its determination that an entity offering prescription drug coverage failed to provide accurate and timely disclosure of the loss of creditable prescription drug coverage or whether the prescription drug coverage offered is creditable . This SEP begins the month of CMS approval of this SEP and continues for two additional calendar months following this approval. (42 CFR 422.62(b)(20)) C. Individuals whose enrollment or non- enrollment in a Part D plan is erroneous due to an action, inaction or error by a Federal Employee. The SEP permits disenrollment and/or enrollment in a Part D pl an on a case -by-case basis. Requests for this SEP must be developed and presented to the CMS Regional Office serving the MA -PD plan for which the SEP will apply. This SEP begins the month of CMS approval of this SEP and continues for two additional months following this approval. (42 CFR 422.62(b)(21)) 43 D. An individual eligible for an additional Part D IEP, such as an individual currently entitled to Medicare due to a disability and who is attaining age 65, has an MA SEP to coordinate with the additional P art D IEP. The SEP may be used to disenroll from an MA -only or MA -PD plan to Original Medicare, or to enroll in an MA -only plan (regardless of whether the individual uses the Part D IEP to enroll in a PDP). The SEP begins and ends concurrently with the additional Part D IEP. (42 CFR 422.62(b)(22)) For more information about PDP enrollment and disenrollment, please refer to the CMS guidance for PDPs. 10. SEP for Individuals Who Lose Special Needs Status 42 CFR 422.62(b)(11) CMS will provide an SEP for indi viduals enrolled in a SNP who are no longer eligible for the SNP because they no longer meet the specific special needs status. This SEP begins the month the individual's special needs status changes and ends when he or she makes an enrollment request or three calendar months after the effective date of involuntary disenrollment from the SNP, whichever is earlier . 11. SEP for Individuals Who Belong to a Qualified SPAP or Who Lose SPAP Eligibility 42 CFR 422.62(b)(12 ) Individuals who belong to a qualified State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program ( SPAP) are eligible for an SEP to request enrollment in an MA -PD plan at any time through the end of each calen dar year (i.e. once per year). SPAP members may use this SEP to enroll in a Part D plan outside of existi ng enrollment opportunities, allowing them, for example, to join a n MA -PD plan upon becoming a member of an SPAP or to switch to another MA -PD plan. In summary, a beneficiary may use this SEP to switch from an MA -PD plan to another MA -PD plan, from Origina l Medicare without a PDP to an MA-PD plan, from a PDP to another PDP or MA -PD plan or from an MA -only plan (no prescription drug coverage) to a n MA-PD plan. This SEP is available while the individual is enrolled in the SPAP and, upon loss of eligibility f or SPAP benefits, for an additional 2 calendar months after either the month of the loss of eligibility or notification of the loss, whichever is later . 12. SEP for Individuals who Gain, Lose, or Have a Change in the ir Dual or LIS -Eligible Status - 42 CFR 423.38(c)(9) (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) An SEP is provided for individuals who receive \"Extra Help .\" It includes those who: Become eligible for any type of assistance from the Title XIX program (including \"partial duals\" who receive cost sharing assistance under Medicaid) and individuals who qualify for LIS (but who do not receive Medicaid benefits) ; Lose eligibility for any type of assistance ; and Have a change in the level of assistance they receive (e.g., stop receiving Medicaid benefits, but still qualify for LIS, those who have a change in cost sharing, or become eligible for additional Medicaid benefits [e.g., when an individual newly qualif ies as needing nursing home level of care and thus becomes eligible for certain Medicaid long term supports and services, or becomes eligible for full Medicaid after having previously been eligible for Medicaid coverage of Medicare premiums or cost -sharing ]). 44 The SEP allows the individual one opportunity to make an election within three months of any of the changes noted above, or notification of such a change, whichever is later . The effective date for enrollments under this SEP is the first day of the mo nth following receipt of the enrollment request by the plan. NOTE: Use of this SEP does not count towards the once per calendar quarter limitation outlined in SEP #5 in this section. 13. SEP for Enrollment Into a Chronic Care SNP and for Individuals Found Ineligible for a Chronic Care SNP 42 CFR 422.62(b)(13) CMS will provide an SEP for those individuals with severe or disabling chronic conditions to enroll in a SNP designed to serve individuals with those conditions. This SEP is available while the individual has the qualifying condition (s); it ends upon enrollment in the chronic care SNP. Once the SEP ends, that individual may make enrollment changes only during applicable MA election periods. In addition, individuals enrolled in a Chronic Care SNP who have a severe/disabling chronic condition which is not a focus of their current SNP are eligible for this SEP. Such individuals have an opportunity to enroll in a Chronic Care SNP that focuses on this other condition. Eligibility for this SEP ends at the time the individual enrolls in the new SNP. Individuals who are found after enrollment not to have the qualifying condition necessary to enroll in a Chronic Care SNP will have an SEP to enroll in a different MA -PD plan or an MA -only plan with accompan ying Part D coverage. This would normally occur when the required post enrollment verification with a provider did not confirm the information provided on the pre -enrollment assessment tool. This SEP begins when the plan notifies the individual of the la ck of eligibility and extends through the end of that month as well as the following two calendar months. The SEP ends when the individual makes an enrollment election or on the last day of the second of the two calendar months following notification. An y enrollments made during this election period are for prospective effective dates. 14. SEP for Disenrollment from Part D to Enroll in or Maintain Other Creditable Coverage 42 CFR 422.62(b)(14) Individuals may disenroll from a n MA-PD plan) to enroll in or maintain other creditable drug coverage (such as TriCare or VA coverage). The effective date of disenrollment is the first day of the month following the month a disenrollment request is received by the MA organization. Additionally, individuals enrolled in an MA -PD plan who have or are enrolling in other creditable coverage may use this SEP to disenroll from the MA -PD plan by enrolling in an MA -only plan. 15. SEP to Enroll in an MA Plan , PDP or Cost Plan With a Plan Performance Rating o f Five (5) Stars 42 CFR 422.62(b)(15) An eligible individual may enroll in an MA plan offered by an MA organization with a Star Rating of 5 Stars during the year in which that plan has the 5 -star overall performance rating , provided the enrollee meet s the other requirements to enroll in that plan (e.g. , living within the service area ). 45 Individuals may use the 5 -Star SEP to disenroll from a Medicare Advantage plan by enrolling in a 5 - Star cost plan that is open for enrollment. As overall ratings are as signed for the plan contract year (January through December), possible enrollment effective dates are the first of the month from January 1 to December 1 during the year for which the plan has been assigned an overall performance rating of 5 stars. An indi vidual may use this SEP only one time from December 8 through November 30 of the following year in which the organization has been granted a 5 -star overall rating . The enrollment effective date is the first of the month following the month in which the pla n receives the enrollment request. EXAMPLE : Plan X has a n overall rating of 4.5 stars in 2020 and 5 stars for 2021. An individual could use this SEP to request enrollment in Plan X beginning December 8, 20 20 for an effective date of January 1, 20 21. An individual could not use the SEP to enroll in Plan X for an effective date on or before December 1, 20 20, as the enrollment effective dates available during that period are prior to the calendar year for which Plan X has been assigned a 5-star overall rati ng. EXAMPLE : Plan Y has a n overall rating of 5 stars for 20 20 but has lost that 5-star rating for 2021. A beneficiary could use this SEP to request enrollment in Plan Y for the first of the following month until November 30, 20 20, with the last possible e ffective date available being December 1, 2020. The beneficiary could not use the SEP to enroll in Plan Y on or after December 1, 2020, as the enrollment effective dates available during that period are after the calendar year for which Plan Y has been ass igned a 5 -star overall rating . An individual using this SEP can enroll in an MA -only or an MA -PD plan , even if coming from Original Medicare (with or without concurrent enrollment in a PDP). Individuals enrolled in a plan with a 5 -star overall rating may also switch to a different plan with a 5 -star overall rating . An individual in an MA -only or MA -PD coordinated care plan who switches to a PDP with a 5-star overall rating will lose MA coverage and w ill revert to Original Medicare for basic medical co verage. Regardless of whether the individual has Part D coverage prior to use of this SEP, any individual who enrolls in a 5 -star M A Private Fee-for-Service plan without prescription drug coverage or a 5 -star cost plan is eligible for a coordinating Part D SEP to enroll in a PDP. (See Chapter 3, Section 30.3.8 #8, letter H , of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual for more information.) Note that use of this SEP does not guarantee Part D coverage. If an individual in either an MA -PD plan or a PDP chooses to enroll in an MA -only coordinated care plan with a 5-star overall rating , that individual would lose Part D coverage and must wait for a subsequent enrollment period to obtain Part D coverage under the normal enrollment rules. Late enrollment penalties might also apply. Individuals may use the 5- Star SEP to disenroll from an MA plan by enrolling in a 5-Star cost plan that is open for enrollment. EXAMPLE: A cost plan has an overall rating of 5 stars for 2020 and is open for enrollment. An individual enrolled in a MA plan uses this SEP to enroll in the cost plan. The cost plan submits the enrollment transaction to MARx using the \"R\" election type code, and the MA plan accepts and processes the subsequent disenrollment per the Daily Transaction Reply Report (DTRR). 46 16. SEP for Non -U.S. Citizens who become Lawfully Present 42 CFR 422.62(b)(16) CMS will provide an SEP for non-U.S. citizens who become lawfully present in the United States. The individual may use this SEP to request enrollment in any MA plan for which he or she is eligible, including an MA -PD. This SEP begins the month the individual attains lawful presence starts and ends the earlier of when the individual makes an enrollment request or two (2) full calendar months after the month i t begins . 17. SEP for Providing Individuals who Requested Materials in A ccessible Formats Equal Time to Make Enrollment Decisions 42 CFR 422.62(b)(17) (Rev. 2, As outl ined in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) , organizations are required to comply with its requirements, and provide materials in accessible formats to its members. This generally includes formats such as Braille, Data, and Audio files, or other formats accepted by the member in place of , or in addition to, the original print material. A SEP is available to an individual who was adversely affected by having requested, but not received, required notices or information in an accessible format within the same timeframe that the MA organization or CMS provide d the same information to individuals who did not request an accessible format. This limited SEP ensures that beneficiaries who have requested information in accessible form ats are not disadvantaged by any additional time necessary to fulfil l their request, including missing an election period deadline. The SEP begins at the end of the election period during which the beneficiary was seeking to make an election . The length o f the SEP is at least as long as the time it took for the information to be provided to the individual in an accessible format . Organizations may determine eligibility for this SEP when the criterion is met, ensuring adequate documentation of the situation, including records indicating the amount of time taken to provide accessible versions of the requested materials and the amount of time it takes for the same information to be provided to an individual who does not request an accessible format . Individua ls seeking assistance for this SEP may also contact 1 -800-MEDICARE. 18. SEP for Government Entity -Declared Disaster or Other Emergency 42 CFR 422.62(b)( 18) (Rev. 2, Issued: August 12, 2020; Effective/Implementation: 0 1-01-2021) A SEP exists for individuals affected by a disaster or other emergency declared by a Federal, state or local government entity who were unable to, and did not make an election during another valid election period. This includes both enrollment and disenrollment elections. Individuals are eligible for this SEP if they : Reside, or resided at the start of the SEP eligibility period described in this guidance , in an area for which a federal, state or local government entity has declared a disaster or other emergency or they do not reside in an affected area but rely on help making healthcare decisions from one or more individuals who reside in an affected area; and Were eligible for another election period at the time of the SEP eligibility period; and 47 Did not make an election during that other valid election period due to the disaster or other emergency . The SEP starts as of the date the declaration is made, the incident start date or, if different, the start date identified in the declaration, whichever is earlier. The SEP e nds 2 full calendar months following the end date identified in the declaration or, if different, the date the end of the incident is announced, whichever is later . 19. SEP for Individuals Enrolled in a Plan Placed in Receivership 42 CFR 422.62(b)(24) A SEP exists for individuals enrolled in a plan offered by an MA organization that has been placed into receivership by a state or territorial regulatory authority. The SEP begins the month the receivership is effective and continues until it is no longer in effect or until the enrollee makes an election, whichever occurs first. When instructed by CMS, the MA plan that has been placed under receivership must notify its enrollees, in the form and manner directed by CMS, of the enrollees' eligibility for this SE P and how to use the SEP. 20. SEP for Individuals Enrolled in a Plan That Has Been Identified by CMS as a Consistent Poor Performer 42 CFR 422.62(b)(25) A SEP exists for individuals enrolled in a plan that has been identified with the low performing icon in accordance with 42 CFR 422.166(h)(1)(ii). This SEP exists while the individual is enrolled in the low performing MA plan. 21. SEP for Other Exceptional Circumstances 422.62(b)(26) CMS will establish a SEP, on a case by case basis, for individuals whom CMS determines have experienced exceptional circumstances related to enrollments into or disenrollments from an MA plan that are not otherwise captured in regulation. Consistent with current practice, CMS will consider granting an enrollment or disenr ollment opportunity in situations such as the following: Circumstances beyond the beneficiary's control that prevented him or her from submitting a timely request to enroll or disenroll from a plan during a valid election period. This is inclusive of, but not limited to, a serious medical emergency of the beneficiary or his or her authorized representative during an entire election period, a change in hospice status, or mailed enrollment or disenrollment requests returned as undeliverable on or after the last day of an enrollment period. Situations in which a beneficiary provides a verbal or written allegation that his or her enrollment in a MA or Part D plan was based upon misleading or incorrect information provided by a plan representative or State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) counselor, including situations where a beneficiary states that he or she was enrolled into a plan without his or her knowledge or consent, and requests cancellation of the enrollment or disenrollment from the plan. 48 A SEP may be warranted to ensure beneficiary access to services and where without the approval of an enrollment exception, there could be adverse health consequences for the beneficiary. This is inclusive of, but not limited to, maintaining continuity of care for a chronic condition and preventing an interruption in treatment. CMS will review supporting details and documentation to determine eligibility for the SEP for exceptional circumstances. CMS's review can be in response to an individual beneficiary's request for an exception to the current enrollment rules, as well as CMS' determination that an exception is warranted for a group of beneficiaries. The SEP would take effect once CMS makes its determination and the enrollee has been notified. The effect ive date for an enrollment or disenrollment election using an approved enrollment exception would be based on the beneficiary's circumstances and may be either prospective or retroactive. 30.4.5 - SEPs for Beneficiaries Age 65 (SEP65) MA eligible individ uals who elect an MA plan (other than an MSA plan) during the initial enrollment period (IEP) for Part B surrounding their 65th birthday have an SEP. This \"SEP65 \" allows the individual to disenroll from this MA plan and elect the Original Medicare plan any time during the 12 - month period that begins on the effective date of coverage in the MA plan. The IEP for Part B is established by Medicare and begins 3 months before and ends 3 months after the month of the individual's 65th birthday. Individuals entit led to Medicare prior to age 65 are not eligible for the SEP65. 30.4.6 - SEP for Significant Change in Provider Network 42 CFR 422.62(b)(23) (Rev. 1, Iss ued: August 12, 2020; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2021) CMS will establish a SEP, on a case by case basis, for situations in which CMS determines that changes to an MA plan's provider network are significant based on the affect , or potential to affect, current plan enrollees who are assigned to, are currently receiving care from, or who have receive d care within the past 3 months from a provider or facility being terminated from the provider network . The SEP can be used only once per significant change in provider network. It begins the month enrollees are notified of eligibility for the SEP and continues for an additional two calendar months thereafter . 30.4.7 - SEP for CMS and State -Initiated Enrollments 42 CFR 422.60(g)(5) and 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) Individuals who are enrolled into a plan by CMS or a State (i.e., through passive enrollment, auto - enrollment, facilitated enrollment, and reassignment) have an SEP to disenroll from the ir new plan or enroll into a different plan. The SEP permits a onetime election within three months of the effective date of the assignment, or notification of the assignment , whichever is later . It allows the individual to make an election before the enrollment is effective in the receiving plan or after the coverage in the 49 receiving plan starts. This SEP must be used within three months of the start of coverage in the receiving plan. In the case where the notice is sent after the coverage in the receiving plan starts, the SEP ends three months after the date of the notice. This SEP is provided so that an individual may exercise any mandatory \"opt -out\" right provided to the enrollee as part of the CMS or State -initiated enrollment. The effective date for enrollments under this SEP is the first day of the month following receipt of the enrollment reques t by the plan. Individuals passively enrolled due to a plan's non -renewal or termination (outlined in \u00a7 20.4.2) may also be eligible for an SEP as outlined in \u00a7 30.4.3 of this Chapter. 30.5 - Medicare Advantage Open nrollment Period ( MA OEP ) 42 Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2021) During the MA OEP , MA plan enrollees may enroll in another MA plan or disenroll from their MA plan and return to Original Medicare. Individuals may make only one election during the MA OEP. This chart outlines who can use the MA OEP and when: Who can use the MA OEP: MA OEP occurs: Individuals enrolled in an MA plan January 1 - March 31 New Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in an MA plan during their ICEP The month of entitlement to Part A and Part B - the last day of the 3rd month of entitlement Individuals enrolled in an MA plan may add or drop Part D coverage during the MA OEP. Individuals enrolled in either MA -PD or MA -only plans can switch to: MA-PD MA-only Original Medicare (with or without a stand -alone Part D plan) The effective date for an MA OEP election is the first of the month following receipt of the enrollment request. NOTE: The MA OEP does not provide an opportunity for an individual enrolled in Original Medicare to join a MA plan. It also does not allow for Part D changes for individuals enrolled in Original Medicare, including those enrolled in stand -alone Part D plans . The MA OEP is not available for those enrolled in Medicare Savings Accounts or other Medicare health plan types (such as cost plans or PACE). 30.6 - Effective Date of Coverage 42 CFR 422.68(c) (Rev. 2, Issued: August 12, 2021; Effective/Implemen tation: 01 -01-2021) 50 With the exception of some SEPs and when election periods overlap, generally beneficiaries may not request their enrollment effective date. Furthermore, except for EGHP enrollment requests, the effective date is generally not prior to the receipt of an enrollment request by the MA organization. An enrollment cannot be effective prior to the date the beneficiary or his/her legal representative completed the enrollment request. The effective date may not be earlier than the first day of the individual's entitlement to both Medicare Part A and Part B. \u00a740.2 includes procedures for handling situations when a beneficiary chooses an unallowable enrollment effective date. To determine the proper effective date, the MA organization must determine which election period applies to each individual before the enrollment may be transmitted to CMS. The election period may be determined by reviewing information such as the individual's date of birth, Medicare card, a letter from SSA, or by the date the enrollment request is received by the MA organization. Once the election period is identified by the MA organization, the MA organization must determine the effective date. Refer to \u00a760.8 to determine the effective date for a continuation of enrollment. In certain circumstances , EGHP enrollments may be retroactive (refer to \u00a760.6 for more information on EGHP retroactive effective dates). Effective dates are as follows: Election Period Effective Date of Coverage Do MA organizations have to accept enrollment requests in this election period? Initial Coverage Election Period and Initial Enrollment Period for Part D First day of the month of entitlement to Medicare Part A and Part B - or- The first of the month following the month the enrollment request was made if after entitlement has occurred. Yes - unless capacity limit applies (see \u00a730. 9 for capacity limit information). IEP for Part D is applicable only to MA -PD enrollment requests. Open Enrollment Period for Institutionalized Individuals (OEPI) First day of the month after the month the MA organization receives an enrollment request No - the MA organization can choose to be \"open\" or \"closed\" for enrollments during th is period . Annual Election Period January 1 of the following year Yes - unless capacity limit applies Special Election Period First day of the month after the month the MA organization receives an enrollment request, unless otherwise noted. Yes - unless capacity limit applies Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period (MA OEP) First day of the month after the month the MA organization receives an enrollment request No - the MA organization can choose to be \"open\" or \"closed\" for enrollments during this period. 51 It is possible for an individual to make an enrollment request when s/he is eligible for more than one election period , resulting in more than one possible effective date. Therefore, if an organization receives an enrollment request and determines the appl icant is eligible for more than one election period, the organization must allow the individual to choose the enrollment effective date (see exception in the next paragraph regarding the ICEP). To accomplish this, the organization must attempt to contact the individual , and must document its attempt(s), to determine the individual's preferred effective date. Note: This requirement does not apply to beneficiary requests for enrollment into an employer/union sponsored plan using the group enrollment mechanis m, as these may be submitted to CMS with the EGHP SEP election type code. If one of the election periods for which the individual is eligible is the ICEP , the individual may not choose an effective date any earlier than the month of entitlement to Medicare Part A and Part B. EXAMPLE If an individual will be entitled to Medicare Part A and Part B in February his ICEP is November through May. If an MA orga nization receives an enrollment request from that individual during the AEP, the individual may NOT choose a January 1 effective date and must be given a February 1 effective date for the ICEP because January 1st is earlier than the month of entitlement to Medicare Part A and Part B. If an individual is eligible for more than one election period but does not indicate a preferred effective date or the organization is unable to contact the individual, the organization must assign an effective date using the following ranking of election periods. The election period with the highest rank generally determines the effective date of enrollment (refer to \u00a730. 7 for procedures to determine the effective date of voluntary disenrollment). Individuals eligible f or the SEP EGHP and one or more other election periods who make an election via the employer or union election process will be assigned an effective date according to the SEP EGHP, unless the individual requests a different effective date that is allowed b y one of the other elections periods for which s/he is eligible. Ranking of Election Periods: (1 = Highest, 5 = Lowest) 1. ICEP/IEP -D 2. MA OEP 3. SEP 4. AEP 5. OEPI 30.6.1 - Effective Date of Auto - and Facilitated Enrollments The effective dates for a uto-enrollment and facilitated enrollment are described in \u00a740.1.5 of this chapter. 52 30.7 - Effective Date of Voluntary Disenrollment 42 CFR 422.68 (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) With the exception of some SEPs and when election periods overlap, generally beneficiaries may not select their effective date of disenrollment. \u00a750.1 includes procedures for handling situations when a beneficiary ch ooses a disenrollment effective date that is not allowable based on the requirements outlined in this section. When a member disenrolls through the MA organization or 1 -800-MEDICARE, the disenrollment will return the member to Original Medicare. If a member elects a new MA plan while still a member of a different plan, he/she will automatically be disenrolled from the old plan and enrolled in the new plan by CMS systems with no duplication or delay in coverage. As with enrollments, it is possible for a member to make a disenrollment request when more than one election period applies. Therefore, in order to determine the proper effective date, the MA organization must determine which election period app lies to each member before the disenrollment may be transmitted to CMS. If an MA organization receives a disenrollment request when more than one election period applies, the MA organization must allow the member to choose the effective date of disenrollment. If the member does not make a choice of effective date, then the MA organization must give the effective date that results in the earliest disenrollment. Effective dates for voluntary disenrollment are as follows (refer to \u00a7\u00a750.2 and 50.3 for effective dates for involuntary disenrollment). Election Period Effective Date of Disenrollment* Do MA organizations have to accept disenrollment requests in this election period? Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period First day of the month after the month the MA organization receives the disenrollment request. Yes Annual Election Period January 1 of the following year. Yes Special Election Period Varies, as outlined in \u00a730.4 Yes Open Enrollment Period for Institutionalized Individuals First day of the month after the month the MA organization receives the disenrollment request. Yes *NOTE: CMS may allow up to 90 days retroactive payment adjustments for EGHP disenrollments. Refer to \u00a760.6 for more information. 53 30.8 - Election Periods and Effective Dates for Medicare MSA Plans 42 CFR 422. 56, 422.62( d) (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) Individuals may enroll in Medicare MSA plans (should one be offered in their area) only during the ICEP or the AEP; they may not enroll in Medicare MSA plans during a SEP (see exception below). The effective date of coverage is determined by the election period in which a n enrollment request is made. Effective dates are provided in \u00a730. 6 of this chapter. Individuals may disenroll from Medicare MSA plans only during the AEP or an SEP. The effective date of disenrollment during an SEP depends on the type of SEP. Additiona lly, MSA enrollees may not use the MA OEP to disenroll from the MSA. Exception: To facilitate the offering of employer/union sponsored MSA plans, CMS will permit individuals to request enrollment into an employer/union sponsored MSA plan using the Employe r Group Health Plan Special Enrollment Period (EGHP SEP). 30.9 - Closed Plans, Capacity Limits, and Reserved Vacancies 42 CFR 422.60(a)(2), 422.60(b) and 422.66(d)(2) (Rev. 1, Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) An MA organizat ion may specify a capacity limit for one or all of the MA plans it offers and reserve spaces for individual and employer or union group commercial members who are converting from a commercial product to an MA product at the time the member becomes eligible (i.e., conversion enrollments). When an MA plan is closed due to a capacity limit, the MA plan must remain closed to all prospective enrollees (with the exception of reserved vacancies) until space becomes available . All requests from MA organizations f or a capacity limit should be submitted to the CMS R egional Office account manager. All MA plans (with the exception of Medicare MSA plans; see \u00a730.8) must accept enrollment requests made during the AEP, ICEP and SEP unless an approved capacity limit applies. Only with an approved number of reserved vacancies may an MA organization set aside openings for the enrollment of conversions (i.e., ICEP enrollment requests). Unlike the mandatory election periods (AEP, ICEP a nd SEP), an MA organization has the option to voluntarily close one or more of its MA plans to OEP and OEPI enrollment requests . If an MA plan is closed for OEP and OEP I enrollment s, then it is closed to all individuals who are making OEP or OEP I enrollment requests for that plan. All MA plans must accept OEP and OEP I disenrollment requests, regardless of whether or not it is open for enrollment. NOTE: For purposes of auto-enrollment and facilitated enrollment , MA organizations must ensure that the MA -PD plans into which beneficiaries are deemed to have enrolled have the capacity to accept them. Should a capacity limit be proposed for an MA -PD plan, it must be set high enough to ensure all beneficiaries may be transitioned. 30.9.1 - MA Plan Closures 54 The decision to be open or closed for OEP and OEP I enrollment requests rests with the MA organization and does not require CMS approval. However, if an MA organization has an MA plan that is open for OEP and OEP I enrollment requests , and decides to change this process, it must notify CMS and the general public 30 calendar days in advance of the new limitations on the open enrollment process. If an MA organization has more than one MA plan, those plans may be open or closed to OEP and OEPI enrollment requests independent of one another, as the MA organization determines. Further, each MA plan may be open for OEP and OEPI enrollment requests : 1. Only certain months of the year; 2. Some portion of certain months; and/or 3. During the first 25 days (or any part) of each month. When an MA plan is voluntarily closed for OEP and OEP I enrollments , it is closed to ALL OEP and OEP I enrollment requests, but it must accept enrollment requests made during the ICEP and SEP as well as be open for the AEP, unless an approved capacity limit applies and has been reached (excluding reserved vacancies). CMS may approve a partial service area closure for capacity reasons. If a plan is closed in a portion of its service area for capacity reasons, that plan may be open for OEP and OEP I enrollments in the remaining portion of the service area. When an MA plan is closed due to an approved capacity limit that has been reached, it may continue to accept ICEP (i.e., conversion) enrollments only if there are reserved vacancies set aside. If there are no reserved vacancies, or once all of these vacan cies have been filled, the MA organization cannot accept any new enrollees into the MA plan until space becomes available. Refer to \u00a740.5.1 for more information on enrollment processing after reaching capacity. Refer to \u00a740.5 of this chapter for additional information on enrollment processing during closed periods. If an MA organization has an MA plan that is approved by CMS for a capacity limit, it should estimate when a capac ity limit will be reached and notify CMS and the general public 30 calendar days in advance of the closing of the open enrollment process. If CMS approves the capacity limit for immediate closing of enrollment, the MA organization must notify the general public within 15 calendar days of CMS approval that it has closed for enrollment. Exhibit 23 contains three model notices that MA organizations can use to notify the public when they are closing for enrollment. NOTE: Public notices must receive CMS approv al under the usual marketing review process. When an MA organization has a plan that re -opens after being closed to OEP and OEP I enrollment requests or as a result of a capacity limit, there is no requirement for the MA organization to notify the general public. However, the MA organization should notify CMS when this occurs. 55 40 - Enrollment Procedures 42 CFR 422.66 (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) An MA organization must accept enrollment requests it receives, reg ardless of whether they are received in a face- to-face interview, by mail, by facsimile, or through other mechanisms defined by CMS. An individual (or his/her legal representative) must complete an enrollment request mechanism to enroll in an MA plan and submit the enrollment request to the MA plan during a valid enrollment period. If an individual wishes to elect another MA plan in the same parent organization, he/she must complete a new enrollment request to enroll in the new MA plan. Enrollment may als o be made via Auto - and Facilitated enrollment processes as described in \u00a740.1.5 of this chapter and via the group enrollment process for employer or union sponsored plans as described in \u00a740.1.6. Upon receiving an enrollment request, an MA organization m ust provide within 10 calendar days, one of the following: Acknowledgement notice (as described in section 40.4.1); Request for additional information (as described in 40.2.2); or Notice of denial (as described in 40.2.3). If a plan uses the combined acknowledgment/confirmation notice, the plan may send the notice of rejection within 7 calendar days of receiving the D TRR indicating a rejection instead of sending the above items (as described in 40.4.2). Unless otherwise directed in this guidance, the organization must provide required notices in response to information received from CMS on the D TRR that contains the earliest notification . MA organizations may not delay the processing of enrollment requests unless the beneficiary's enrollment request i s being placed on a waiting list, as allowed under \u00a740.5. Refer to \u00a740.2.5 for MA -PD enrollments in which an individual has other qualified prescription drug coverage through an employer or union group. Special Rule for the Annual Election Period (AEP): Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations may not solicit submission of paper enrollment forms or accept telephone or on -line enrollment requests prior to the beginning of the AEP. Brokers and agents under contract to MA organizations may not accept or solicit submission of paper enrollment forms prior to the start of the AEP . MA organizations and their brokers and agents also should remind beneficiaries that they cannot submit enrollment requests prior to the start of the AEP . Despite these efforts, CMS recognizes that MA organizations may receive unsolicited paper enrollment forms prior to the start of the AEP, given that marketing activities may begin prior to this date. To be considered unsolicited, the MA organization must have received the paper AEP enrollment request directly from the applicant and not through a sales agent or broker. Other enrollment request mechanisms may not be accepted prior to the actual start of the AEP. Paper AEP enrollment requests received prior to the start of the AEP for which there is indication of sales agent or 56 broker involvement in the submission of the request (i.e., the name or contact information of a sales agent or broker) must be in vestigated by the organization for compliance with the requirements in the Medicare Communications and Marketing Guidelines. If an MA organization receives unsolicited paper enrollment forms on or after October 1st but prior to the start of the AEP , it must retain and process them as follows: Within 7 calendar days of the receipt of a paper enrollment request, the MA organization must provide the beneficiary with a written notice that acknowledges receipt of the complete enrollment request, and indicate s that the enrollment will take effect on January 1 of the following year (refer to Exhibits 4, 4a , 4b and 4 c for model notices). For AEP enrollment requests received prior to the start of the AEP , the MA organization must submit all transactions to CMS systems (MARx) on the first day of the AEP with an \"application date\" of the same date. For example, unsolicited AEP paper enrollment requests received October 1 through October 14 must be submitted on October 15th with an \"application date\" of October 15th of the current year in the appropriate data field on the enrollment transaction. If a beneficiary has submitted more than one AEP paper enrollment request prior to the start of the AEP , the beneficiary will be enrolled in a plan based on the first applic ation that is processed. Once the MA organization receives a MARx D TRR from CMS indicating whether the individual's enrollment has been accepted or rejected, it must meet the remainder of the requirements (e.g., sending a notice of the acceptance or rejec tion of the enrollment within 10 calendar days following receipt of the D TRR from CMS) provided in \u00a740.4.2. Note: If organizations receive incomplete unsolicited AEP paper enrollment requests prior to the start of the AEP , they must follow existing guid ance for working with beneficiaries to complete the applications (refer to \u00a740.2.2). Again, this policy applies only to the receipt of unsolicited paper enrollment forms prior to the beginning of the AEP. To help ensure a successful AEP season, it is impe rative that organizations follow these steps and submit valid enrollment transactions promptly as directed. 40.1 - Format of Enrollment Requests 42 CFR 422.60(c) Rev. 2, Issued: August 12, 20 20; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2021) MA organizations must have, at minimum, a paper enrollment form process available for potential enrollees to request enrollment in an MA plan. In addition to the paper enrollment form, MA organizations have the option to accept enrollment requests through other approved mechanisms as described in \u00a7\u00a7 40.1.2, 40.1.3, 40.1.4 and 40.1.5 below. 57 40.1.1 - Request Mechanisms Rev. 1, Issued: August 12, 2020; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2021) The MA organization must use an enrollment mechanism that complies with CMS' guidelines in format and content. Specific model enrollment forms have been developed for each plan type as follows: Exhibit 1 - MA coordinated care plans Exhibit 1b - MSA p lans Exhibit 1c - PFFS plans Organizations should utilize the model appropriate to the plan type for all enrollment request mechanisms to ensure all required elements are included. CMS has also developed a model EGHP enrollment (Exhibit 2) for EGHP member s, a model short enrollment form (\"short form\") (Exhibit 3) and a model plan selection form (Exhibit 3a) to allow for enrollment requests into another plan (PBP) offered by the same parent organization. For determining the appropriate use of the short form or model plan selection form, CMS defines parent organization as the contract numbers (H#) and legal entities that are owned and operated by a single organization in a single State . As a result, a short form or a model plan selection form may be used only for enrollment request s into another plan of the same type (i.e., HMO to HMO, PPO to PPO, or PFFS to PFFS) . Organizations can utilize model enrollment forms included in Exhibits 1-3a, or choose to develop their own materials using these models as a gui de. Materials are subject to the CMS review and approval of plan marketing materials. In addition to the information collected on the request, the enrollment mechanism must include information indicating that the applicant acknowledge s-- The requirement to keep Part A and B ; That they will abide by the rules of the MA plan; The release of information to Medicare and other plans. Information may be used to track enrollment and for other purposes, as allowed under federal law ; That enrollment in the MA plan automatically disenrolls him or her from any other Medicare health plan and prescription drug plan. Note: The model PFFS and MSA enrollment mechanisms provide language as appropriate; and The right to appeal service and payment denials made by the organization. Please refer to Appendix 2 for a complete listing of required elements that must be included on enrollment mechanisms and Exhibits 1 - 3a for complete information on the se statements. The plan premium is not required to be displayed or dis closed on the enrollment mechanism unles s it is part of the plan name. Organization s may include the premium amount on the enrollment 58 mechanism if they choose to do so, but they must do so consistently for all PBPs listed on the enrollment mechanism . Special Needs Plans (SNPs) must include elements on the enrollment mechanism that correspond to the special needs focus of the particular SNP. Medical Savings Plans (MSA) must include elements on the enrollment form as provided in Exhibit 1b. No enrollm ent form or other enrollment request mechanism may include a question regarding binding arbitration, whether the individual receives hospice coverage (except MSA plans) or any other health screening information, with the exception of questions regarding nu rsing home status (some additional exceptions apply for SNPs; please refer to \u00a740.2, item \"D\" of this chapter). Refer to \u00a760.9 for requirements regarding retention of enrollment request mechanisms. 40.1.2 - Electronic Enrollment 42 CFR 422.60(c) Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) MA organizations may develop and offer electronic enrollment mechanisms made available via a n electronic device or secure internet website. The following standards , in addition to al l other program requirements, apply to electronic enrollment mechanisms: Submit all materials, web pages, and images (e.g. screen shots) related to the electronic enrollment process for CMS approval following the established process for the review and approval of marketing materials and other enrollment request mechanisms. Provide individuals with all the information required by Medicare regulations and communication and marketing guidelines for the MA program. At a minimum, comply with CMS' data security policies. Advise each individual at the beginning of the electronic enr ollment process that he or she is completing an actual enrollment request to the MA organization. Capture the same data as required on the model enrollment form (see Exhibit 1 and Appendix 2). o For enrollment requests from one plan to another plan within the same parent organization, the data required on the model short enrollment form are sufficient, provided the plan can verify that the individual is currently enrolled in the parent organization at the time the individual submits the enrollment request. o Electronic ICEP enrollment requests from individuals enrolled in a non -Medicare plan under the same organization (or parent organization) and transitioning to the MA plan without a break in coverage may be based on the simplified opt -in enrollment mechani sm as described in \u00a7 40.1.9. As part of any electronic enrollment process, obtain an electronic signature from the applicant or include a clear and distinct step that requires the applicant to activate an \"Enroll Now,\" or \"I Agree,\" type of button or tool. By taking this affirmative step, the individual indicates his or her intent to enroll. It must also be made clear to the applicant that, by taking this action, he or she agrees to the release of information as provided on the model enrollment form (see Ex hibit 1), and 59 attests to the truthfulness of the data provided. The process must also remind the individual of the penalty for providing false information. See \u00a740.2 for information about legally binding electronic signatures. The electronic enrollment mechanism must capture an accurate time and date stamp at the time the applicant executes the electronic signature or activates the step in the previous bullet (i.e. \"Enroll Now or I Agree\" button or tool). The organization will use this data to establish the application date for the enrollment request. This time stamp also marks the start of the seven day timeframe for processing the enrollment request, as it is at this time that the enrollment request is considered by CMS to be received by the MA organizatio n. If a legal representative is completing this enrollment request, he or she must attest that he or she has such authority to make the enrollment request and that proof of this authority is available upon request by the MA organization or CMS. Inform the individual of the effects of completing the electronic enrollment, including that the individual will be enrolled (if approved by CMS), and that he or she will receive notice (of acceptance or denial) following submission of the enrollment to CM S. Include a tracking mechanism (e.g., a confirmation number) to provide the individual with evidence that the MA organization has received the electronic enrollment request. Optionally, may request or collect premium payment or other payment information, such as a bank account number or credit card numbers. Maintain electronic records that are securely stored and readily reproducible for the period required in \u00a760.9 of this chapter. The MA organization's record of the enrollment request must exist in a format that can be easily, accurately and quickly reproduced for later reference by each individual member and/or CMS. A data extract file alone is not acceptable. Plans have t he option of obtaining technical and related services from outside entities in support of the MA organization's electronic enrollment mechanism , (e.g. licensed software). MA organizations may use downstream entities, such as a broker or third party website, as a means of facilitating and capturing the electronic enrollment request. However, organizations retain complete responsibility for ensuring enrollment policies in this guidance are followed, and for ensuring the appropriate handling of any sensitive beneficiary information provided as part of the online enrollment, including those facilitated by downstream entities. From the point at which an individual selects the plan of his or her choice on the third-party website and begins the online enrollment process, CMS holds the organization responsible for the security and privacy of the information provided by the applicant and for the timely disclosure of any breaches . Medicare Online Enrollment Center In addition to the process described above, CMS offers an online enrollment center (OEC) through the Medicare.gov website and the 1 -800-MEDICARE Call Center for enrollment into Medicare Advantage plans (except for MSA) and Medicare prescription drug plans. The date and time \"stamped\" by the Medicare OEC will serve as the application date for purposes of determining the election period and enrollment ef fective date. MA organizations must promptly retrieve enrollment requests from the OEC and should check for requests at least daily. 40.1. 3 - Enrollment v ia Telephone (Rev. 2, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) MA organizations may accept requests for enrollment into their MA plans via an incoming (in -bound) telephone call to a plan representative or agent. MAOs may also accept enrollment requests during 60 communications initiated by the organization when, during the course of outreach to provide information about their Medicare plan offerings to individuals with whom they have an existing business relationship, the individual expr esses a desire to enroll in one of the organization's MA plans. The following standards apply , in addition to all other applicable program requirements: Enrollment requests from individuals with whom the organization does not have an existing business relationship may be accepted only during an incoming (or in -bound) telephone call from a beneficiary. This includes inbound calls to an incorrect department or extension transferred internally. For all telephonic enrollment requ ests, t he MA organization must ensure that the telephonic enrollment request is effectuated entirely by the benefic iary or his or her authorized representative. Individuals must be advised that they are completing an enrollment request. Each telephonic en rollment request must be recorded (audio) and include a statement of the individual's agreement to be recorded, all required elements necessary to complete the enrollment (as described in Appendix 2), and a verbal attestation of the intent to enroll. If t he request is made by someone other than the beneficiary, the recording must include the attestation regarding the individual's authority under State law to complete the request, in addition to the required contact information. All telephonic enrollment r ecordings must be reproducible and maintained as provided in section \u00a760. 9. Include a tracking mechanism to provide the individual with evidence that the telephonic enrollment request was received (e.g. a confirmation number). Optionally, organizations may request or collect premium payment or other payment information needed, such as a bank account number or credit card numbers, to process the form of premium payment requested by the individual. A notice of acknowledgement and other required information must be provided to the individual as described in \u00a740.4.1. Telephonic enrollment requests into a plan offered by the same parent organization may be based on the model short enrollment form (Exhibit 3) or the model plan selection form ( Exhibit 3a ) instea d of the comprehensive individual enrollment form. Telephonic ICEP enrollment requests from individuals enrolled in a non -Medicare plan under the same organization (or parent organization) and transitioning from the non -Medicare plan to the MA plan withou t a break in coverage may be based on the simplified opt -in enrollment mechanism as described in \u00a7 40.1.9. The MA organization must ensure that all MA eligibility and enrollment requirements provided in this chapter are met. Scripts for completing an enro llment request in this manner must be developed by the MA organization and submitted to CMS for review and approval . The scripts must contain the required elements for completing an enrollment request as described in Appendix 2, and must receive CMS approval in accordance with applicable Medicare regulations before use. 40.1. 4 - Default Enrollment Option for Medicaid Managed Care Plan Enrollees who are Newly Eligible for Medicare Advantage 42 CFR 422.66(c) and 422.68(a) (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) 61 Subject to prior CMS approval, MA organizations may automatically enroll newly eligible Medicare beneficiaries into a dual eligible MA special needs plan (D-SNP) . Default enrollment is permitted only for individuals who: are newly eligible for Medicare Advantage; are currently enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan offered by the MA organization ( or by an entity under the same parent organization as the MA organization) ; and will remain in the Medicaid managed care plan upon their conversion to Medicare. CMS approval of default enrollment To qualify for default enrollment, an MA organization must have an affiliated Medicaid managed care plan. An affiliated Medicaid managed care plan is one that is offered by the MA organization that also offers the D -SNP (or is offered by an entity under the same parent organization as the MA organization). The MA organization must be able to demonstrate : State approval for the use of a default enrollment process in its contract with the state Medicaid agency ; and State agreement to provide the information that is necessary for the MA organization to identify individuals in their Medicaid managed care plan who are in their MA initial coverage election period . NOTE: Data provided by the State must include all information necessary to submit the enrollment transaction to CMS (i.e., Medicare number, date of birth, etc.) . MA organizations must have a minimum overall quality rating from the mos t recently issued ratings of at least 3 stars (or be a low enrollment contract or new MA plan as defined in \u00a7 422.252) and must not have any prohibition on new enrollment imposed by CMS. MA organizations must submit proposals to the ir CMS Account Manager via HPMS and receive CMS approval before beginning any default enrollments under this authority. Proposals for default enrollment must include a description of the MA organization's process to identify individuals eligible for default enrollment, including: Those currently enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan offered by the organization and who are about to convert to Medicare; How the process ensures the organization will identify eligible individuals in time to provide the required written notice to these individuals no fewer than 60 days prior to the date of their initial Medicare eligibility (the conversion date); and How the process ensures identification of individuals whose upcoming Medicare eligibility is based on disability as well a s age. Notice to individ uals about automatic (default) enrollment Proposals must include a copy of the required written notice and copies of any written, telephonic or electronic outreach materials for CMS prior approval, as well as a description of the o rganization's outreach activity for its default enrollment process. The required written notice must include the following: 62 Information and materials required under \u00a7 422.111 for initial enrollments (e.g., E vidence of Coverage and S ummary of Benefits ); Information on how to opt -out of (decline) the enrollment prior to the enrollment effective date, and either enroll in Original Medicare or choose another MA plan . This must include the opportunity to contact the MA organization either in writing or by telephone to a toll -free number. The MA organization is prohibited from discouraging declination. The organization will submit opt -out requests to CMS as enrollment cancellations ; Information on the differences in premium, benefits , and cost sharing between the individual's current Medicaid managed care plan and the D -SNP; Information on the process for accessing care under the D -SNP; and A general description of alternative Medicare health and drug coverage options available to an individual in his or her Initial Coverage Election Period. Default enrollment process The MA organization will send the enrollment transaction to CMS at the same time that it sends the written notice (i.e., no fewer than 60 days prior to the conversion da te). Default e nrollment transactions must be submitted with election code type 'J' and must always use the first day of an individual's ICEP as the application date . The enrollment effective date must always be the date of the individual's first entitlement to both Medicare Part A and Part B. Opt -out requests receive d after coverage begins are to be processed as disenrollment requests ; once enrolled in the MA plan, t hese individuals may use the MA OEP to either enroll in Original Medicare or choo se another MA plan (see \u00a7 30.4 for more information) . Approval Period CMS may approve an MAO using the default enrollment for a period of up to five years. Such approval shall continue after contract consolidations or other CMS -approved changes to the Plan Benefit Package if the D -SNP continues to be offered by the same parent organization and continues to meet all qualifying criteria for default enrollment. CMS may suspend or rescind approval prior to the expiration of this period if CMS determines th e MA organization is not in compliance with the requirements of this section. An MA organization that want s to continue default enrollment after the expiration of an approval period must re -apply and CMS must approve the request to use default enrollment before the MA organization begins default enrollments again . MA organizations may not continue to use default enrollment if they are pending a response from CMS at the time their approval period expires. 40.1. 5 - Auto - and Facilitated Enrollment 42 CFR 423.34 (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) CMS requires that MA organizations offering both MA -PD and MA -only plans have a process for auto- and facilitated enrollment. All LIS eligible individuals who elect an MA plan without Medicare prescription drug benefits (\"MA -only plan\") will be auto - or facilitated enrolled into an MA -PD plan in the same organization or into a PDP offered by the same organization, unless the individual declines the enrollment. The MA organizatio n's auto - and facilitated enrollment processes will occur monthly . As noted in the preamble to the final regulation for Part D (Federal Register/Vol. 70, No. 18, January 28, 2005), the legal authority for both auto- and facilitated enrollment processes is technically termed \"facilitated\" enrollment, since auto -enrollment is limited to PDPs. However, the term \"auto - 63 enrollment\" is used here to denote the process that applies to full -benefit dual eligible individuals, and \"facilitated enrollment\" to others wi th LIS . CMS has safeguards in place to prevent existing MA and cost plan enrollees from being auto - or facilitated enrolled by CMS into a PDP. However, there may be instances in which a beneficiary's request to enroll into an MA plan will not yet be ref lected in CMS systems at the point in time when CMS processes auto - or facilitated PDP enrollments. In these cases, the beneficiary will receive a notice from CMS informing him/her that s/he has been enrolled into a PDP. However, once the beneficiary's r equest to enroll into the MA plan is processed by CMS, it will prevail over the previously processed auto - or facilitated PDP enrollment submitted by CMS. Please note this section does not apply to MA organizations that offer only MA -PD plans, as all th eir enrollees already have Part D coverage. Nor does it apply to PFFS plans offered by organizations that do not offer any MA-PD plans (these beneficiaries are included in the standard CMS auto/facilitated enrollment process into PDPs), nor to MA organizat ions in the U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico , or to employer sponsored MA plans . Starting January 1, 2010, CMS implemented the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition (L imited Income NET) demonstration , which modif ied its procedures for auto/faci litating enrollment of LIS beneficiaries into PDPs for those who have retroactive enrollment effective dates. That demonstration does not impact the auto/facilitated requirements for MA organizations as specified in this section, except for MA -PFFS plans that autoenroll new full benefit dual eligible enrollees into a PDP owned by the same organization (see \u00a740.1.5, item B as well as Exhibit 27A). A. Populations 1. Auto-Enrollment Full-benefit dual eligibles in MA -only plans will be auto -enrolled by the MA organization into an MA-PD plan. Full -benefit dual eligible individuals are defined as those eligible for comprehensive Title XIX Medicaid benefits as well as eligible for Medica re Part D. This includes those who are eligible for comprehensive Medicaid benefits plus Medicaid payment of Medicare cost -sharing (sometimes known as QMB -plus or SLMB -plus). Please note that full -benefit dual eligible individuals do not include those el igible only for Medicaid payment of Medicare cost -sharing (i.e. QMB -only, SLMB -only, or QI). In Part D, these distinctions are key to distinguishing full -benefit dual eligibles, who need to be auto-enrolled, from other types of dual eligibles, who need to be facilitated enrolled. Full-benefit dual eligible individuals to be auto- enrolled include those who are full -benefit dual eligible upon initial enrollment into an MA -only plan, as well as existing Medicare enrollees of an MA-only plan who become new ly Medicaid eligible. This includes full -benefit dual eligible MA -only enrollees who reside in the 50 states or the District of Columbia. This excludes full -benefit dual eligibles who: Live in any of the five U.S. territories; Live in another country; 64 Are individuals for whom an employer or union is claiming the retiree drug subsidy, or are enrolled in an employer -sponsored MA -only plan, including MA -only \"800 series\" plans. Are incarcerated, as defined in \u00a710 ; Are not lawfully present in the U.S.; or Have opted out of auto -enrollment into the Part D benefit . [For MA -PFFS only] Are already enrolled in a stand -alone Prescription Drug Plan 2. Facilitated enrollment Other LIS eligibles are defined as those deemed automatically eligible for LIS because they are QMB - only, SLMB -only, QI (i.e. only eligible for Medicaid payment of Medicare premiums and/or cost - sharing); SSI -only (Medicare and Supplemental Security Income [SSI], but no Medicaid); or those who apply for LIS at the Social Security Administrati on (SSA) or a State Medicaid Agency and are determined eligible for LIS. This includes those who apply and are determined eligible for either the full or partial level of the LIS. Other LIS eligible individuals to be facilitated enrolled include those who are Other LIS eligible upon initial enrollment into an MA -only plan, as well as existing Medicare enrollees of an MA -only plan who become newly Other LIS eligible. This includes Ot her LIS eligible MA -only enrollees who reside in the 50 states or the District of Columbia. This excludes Other LIS eligible individuals who: Live in any of the five U.S. territories, Live in another country, Are individuals for whom the employer or u nion is claiming the retiree drug subsidy, or are enrolled in an employer -sponsored MA -only plan, including MA -only \"800 series\" plans, Are incarcerated , as defined in \u00a710; Are not lawfully present in the U.S.; or Have opted out of facilitated enrollment into the Part D benefit. [For MA -PFFS only] Are already enrolled in a stand -alone Prescription Drug Plan B. Auto/Facilitated Enrollment Process The procedure for auto/facilitated enrollment is as follows: 1. The MA organization will identify full -benefit dual eligibles to be auto- enrolled, and Other LIS eligibles to be facilitated enrolled. Please see subsection C for details on how to distinguish the two populations. a. Auto/facilitated enrollment specifically excludes individuals in employer -sponsored MA - only plans, including \"800 series\" plans, and individuals with Retiree Drug Subsidy (RDS). b. For PFFS plans, the organization must exclude individuals who are already enrolled in a stand -alone P DP. The organization may submit a Batch Eligibility Query (BEQ) transaction or access the MARx online query (M232 screen) to determine whether individuals are enrolled in a stand -alone PDP. 65 2. The MA organization will then identify MA -PD plans in the same se rvice area, and in the same MA organization, with the lowest combined Part C and Part D premium amount. If more than one MA -PD plan have the same lowest premium amount, auto -enrollment must be random among the available MA -PD plans. The selection of MA -PD plan is without regard to the Part C cost -sharing. The only exception to this is when the MA -PD plan is a high -deductible plan, unless the high-deductible plan is the only MA -PD plan offered in the area. Please note that the Part D premium is the doll ar amount equaling the premium charged to a beneficiary with a 100 percent premium subsidy. If an MA Special Needs Plan (SNP) meets these criteria, the MA organization must ensure that the individual meets the eligibility criteria for the SNP (e.g. type o f dual eligible, type of chronic condition, or institutionalized). Please note the \"MA full dual file\" uses LIS deemed reason code to identify full duals, meaning they were full dual in at least one month in the past year; it cannot be used by MA organiza tions to confirm dual status in the current month. If the MA SNP does not meet the criteria of lowest combined Part C and D premium (with the Part D premium equaling the premium charged to a beneficiary with a 100 percent premium subsidy), the MA organiz ation may not auto-enroll full benefit dual eligibles into it, even if it is a dual eligible SNP. Organizations offering both an MA -PD PFFS plan and a stand -alone PDP in the same region with a basic benefit and a premium at or below the low -income premium subsidy amount for that region may auto/facilitate enrollment into either the MA -PD PFFS plan or the PDP, but must apply this policy consistently for all PFFS plans offered by the organization. CMS will conduct auto/facilitated enrollment of LIS individua ls enrolled in MA -only PFFS plans where the organization does not offer an MA -PD PFFS plan, even if they also offer a stand -alone PDP. 3. Within 10 calendar days of identifying an individual as needing auto/facilitated enrollment, the MA organization sends an auto/facilitated enrollment notice to the beneficiary (see Exhibits 27, 27A, 28 and 28a). 4. If the person does not respond or opt -out by the deadline below, submit a Code 61 transaction (PBP change) for the auto/facilitated enrollment into the MA -PD plan and include the appropriate effective date within the timelines specified below (see subsection C). The new MA-PD plan will be notified of the auto/facilitated enrollment via a transaction reply. Auto -enrollment - within 10 calendar days of sending notice Facilitated enrollment - by last day before effective date of facilitated enrollment 66 C. Effective Date of Auto/Facilitated Enrollments 1. Auto-Enrollment The effective date of auto -enrollment is retroactive to the first day of the month the individual first became a full -benefit dual eligible, or January 1, 2006, whichever is later. For individuals who are full-benefit dual eligible upon enrollment into an MA -only plan, the effective date would be retroactive to the effective date of enrollm ent in the MA -only plan. For existing MA -only Medicare enrollees who subsequently become Medicaid eligible, the effective date is retroactive to the first day of the month the person became Medicaid eligible. I n no case will the effective date of auto - enrollment precede the date that the individual became an enrollee of the MA organization. For MA -PFFS plans that elect to auto -enroll a full -benefit dual eligible beneficiary into a PDP offered by the same organization, the effective date will be prospective, i.e., the first day of the second month after the enrollee is identified as a new full benefit dual eligible. This is because CMS implement ed the Limited Income NET demonstration in January, 2010, in which a single contractor addresses all retroactive periods of PDP auto-enrollment. The MA -PFFS may not submit an election on behalf of a beneficiary into the Limited Income NET demonstration contractor. To ensure the beneficiary is aware s/he can request retroactive coverage from the demonstrat ion contractor, Exhibit 27a includes instructions on how to do so. There is nothing that prohibits a full -benefit dual eligible from initially electing an MA -only plan. To ensure they understand the consequences of doing so, marketing material and the acknowledgement letter emphasize that prescription drugs are not covered. 2. Facilitated Enrollment The effective date of facilitated enrollment for all Other LIS eligible members is the first day of the second month after the person is identified as qua lifying for facilitated enrollment. For example, if the plan is notified in August 2010 that an existing member of an MA -only plan has become LIS eligible, the effective date is October 1, 2010. The MA organization may move up the effective date of a f acilitated enrollment by a month if an Other LIS beneficiary requests this in a timely fashion, i.e. before start of earlier month. The SEP under \u00a730.4.4 #12 should be used . Example: The MA organization facilitates enrollment of an Other LIS eligible in M ay, 2010, effective July 1, 2010. The beneficiary receives the facilitated enrollment by the last day in May, and requests the MA organization makes the facilitated enrollment effective June 1. The MA organization submits an enrollment transaction to do so. 3. Distinguishing Between Full -Benefit Dual Eligible and Other LIS Individuals MA organizations need to distinguish full benefit dual eligibles from others with LIS for purposes of setting the effective date. The first step is to identify all LIS eligibles in the MA -only plan. In the past, CMS did not transmit a data element to plans that could be used to distinguish full -benefit dual eligibles from other LIS. As a result, CMS sends a monthly \"Auto Assignment Full Dual Notification File\" (for file format and technical specifications, please see section 8.1 of the Plan Communications 67 User Guide, on the CMS website at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/mmahelp/. This file identifies full -benefit dual eligibles. However, starting December, 2010, t he monthly membership report (MMR) will include a new field (Medicaid dual status code) that will provide the dual status code of the enrollee, if that enrollee has Medicaid status. The new field will be aligned with the already -existing Field 40 (Current Medicaid Status). If Field 40 indicates that the enrollee has Medicaid status, Field 85 will provide the dual status code for that enrollee. Field 40 indicates that an enrollee is Medicaid when that enrollee has a Medicaid period reported to CMS for either the month prior to payment or two months prior to payment. Please note that Field 40 and, thus the new field, are not related to payment , but are provided for purposes of benefits coordination and bidding. The new field will be coded as follows: The val id values when Field 40 = 1 are: 01 = Eligible is entitled to Medicare - QMB only 02 = Eligible is entitled to Medicare - QMB AND Medicaid coverage 03 = Eligible is entitled to Medicare - SLMB only 04 = Eligible is entitled to Medicare - SLMB AND Medicaid coverage 05 = Eligible is entitled to Medicare - QDWI 06 = Eligible is entitled to Medicare - Qualifying individuals 08 = Eligible is entitled to Medicare - Other Dual Eligibles (Non QMB, SLMB,QDWI or QI) with Medicaid coverage 09 = Eligible is entitled to Medicare - Other Dual Eligibles but without Medicaid coverage 99=Unknown The valid value when Field 40 = 0 is: 00 = No Medicaid Status The valid value when Field 40 is blank is: Blank Full-benefit dual eligible benefici aries are represented by dual status codes 02, 04, and 08. To ensure a sufficient period of transition, CMS will continue to send the Auto Assignment Full Dual Notification File to identify the subset of the LIS enrollees in the MA -only plan who are full -benefit dual eligibles. Plans may begin using the MMR instead, but starting August, 2011, plans will be required to use the MMR as CMS will discontinue transmission of the Auto Assignment Full Dual Notification File . To determine the auto -enrollment effe ctive date, identify the LIS copay start date data provided on other files (i.e., Transaction Reply Report or monthly LIS history report). MA-PFFS plans that elect to auto/facilitate enroll new LIS beneficiaries into a PDP offered by the same organization do not need to distinguish between full -benefit dual eligible enrollees and others with LIS because the effective date will always be prospective. The remaining LIS eligibles in the MA -only plan qualify for facilitated enrollment, and the effective date should be set as noted in item 2 above. D. Notice 68 The MA organization will notify the beneficiary in writing that she/he will be enrolled in the given MA-PD plan on the specified effective date. The notice must be sent within 10 calendar days of identif ying the individual as qualifying for auto/facilitated enrollment. The notice will inform the beneficiary that they may choose another Part D plan (either another MA -PD plan or Original Medicare with a PDP) or opt out of auto/facilitated enrollment into the Part D benefit. If the beneficiary does not opt out, or choose another Part D plan within the specified deadline, the person's silence will be deemed to be an election of the auto/facilitated enrollment and it will take effect on the effective date. T hese individuals will also be informed they have a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) that permits them to change Part D plans, even after the auto/facilitated enrollment takes effect. 1. Auto-Enrollment Please use the model notice language in Exhibit 27. For MA -PFFS auto -enrolling into a PDP, please use Exhibit 27a. The deadline for responding is 10 calendar days from when the notice is sent. 2. Facilitated enrollment Please use the model notice lang uage in Exhibit 28. For MA -PFFS auto -enrolling into a PDP, please use Exhibit 28a. The deadline for responding is the last day before the facilitated enrollment effective date. E. Opt -Out Full-benefit dual eligible and Other LIS individuals may opt -out, or affirmatively decline, the Part D benefit. Beneficiaries may opt -out verbally or in writing. For an MA -only plan enrollee, this primarily means declining auto/facilitated enrollment into an MA -PD plan in the same organization and maintaining enroll ment in the MA -only plan. MA organization may check the common User Interface to see if the individual has previously opted out; if so, the person should not be auto/facilitated enrolled. Once a beneficiary has opted out, the MA organization should docume nt this and not include him/her in future auto/facilitated enrollment processing. The MA plan should counsel the individual to ensure they understand the implications of their request to decline, and should confirm this in writing (see Exhibit 29) within 10 calendar days of the individual's request to opt -out. If a beneficiary opts out of auto/facilitated enrollment by the deadline in the auto/facilitated notice, do not submit an enrollment transaction that would move them to an MA - PD plan. This will hav e the effect of leaving him/her in the MA -only plan. If the individual opts -out after the Code 61 transaction has been submitted, the effective date of returning to the MA -only plan is normally prospective, i.e. first day of the following month. However , through the 15th of the month after the month in which the notice was sent, at a full -dual eligible beneficiary's request, the MA organization may restore the person to the MA -only plan retroactive to the auto -enrollment effective date. This is accompli shed by submitting a Code 61 transaction with the same effective date, and setting the opt -out flag as noted below. Individuals who want to opt -out of auto/facilitated enrollment into an MA -PD plan must do so with their MA organization, not through 1 -800-MEDICARE. This differs from the procedure for individuals who want to opt -out of auto/facilitated enrollment into a stand -alone PDP. If a 61 69 transaction has already been submitted to move the person to the MA -PD plan, the MA organization sends another 61 transaction (to move the person back to the MA -only plan), setting the Part D Opt - Out Flag (field 38) to Y (opt -out of auto-enrollment) . If it has not, submit just the opt out indicator on a 79 transaction. An individual who opts out does not permanently surrender his or her eligibility for, or right to enroll in, a Part D plan; rather, this step ensures the person is not included in future monthly auto/facilitated enrollment processes. To obtain Part D benefits, the beneficiary simply makes a voluntary request to enroll into a plan that offers Part D benefits. F. Special Procedures for Individuals With Employer Coverage When the individual's employer or union-sponsored enrollment, including in \"800 series\" plans, or Retirement Drug Subsidy ( RDS) status is known, the MA organization shall exclude the individual from auto/facilitated enrollment. It is possible the MA organization will not be aware an individual has RDS until they submit a Code 61 transaction to auto/facilitate his/her enrollmen t. As with all enrollment transactions for individuals with RDS, MARx will enforce a two -step process, initially rejecting the transaction. The MA organization must follow normal procedures of confirming with the beneficiary that she/he wants to be enrol led in the Part D benefit and, if confirmed, resubmit the transaction with the employer subsidy override. G. Information Provided to Auto/Facilitated Enrolled Beneficiaries The MA -PD plan into which the beneficiary has been auto/facilitated enrolled must send a modified version of the pre - and post -enrollment materials required to be provided to new enrollees. If the effective date is retroactive into the previous calendar year, only send the current year's version of the documents below. Prior to effective date, the MA -PD plan must send: The information required in \u00a740.4.1, and A Summary of Benefits (those who are auto/facilitated enrolled still need to make a decision whether to stay with the plan into which they have been auto/facilitated enrolled or change to another one that better meets their needs). Providing the Summary of Benefits, which is considered marketing material normally provided prior to making an enrollment request, ensures that those auto/facilitated enrolled have a similar scope of information as those who voluntarily enroll. After the effective date of coverage: The guidance in \u00a740.4.2 applies, including guidance on what to do if the MA -PD plan is not notified early enough of an auto/facilitated enrollment to meet the timelines in \u00a740.4.1 on materials required to be provided prior to the effective date. H. Summary of Differences b etween Auto - and Facilitated Enrollment Processes 70 Auto -Enrollment of Full Duals Facilitated Enrollment of Other LIS Steps Identify full dual eligibles in MA-only plan who need to be enrolled into MA -PD plan Send notice to beneficiary within 10 calendar days of identifying need for person to be auto -enrolled If no answer or person does not opt out within 10 calendar days, submit 61 transaction t o move to MA - DPD plan Identify non -full dual LIS beneficiaries in MA -only plan who need to be enrolled into MA-PD plan Send notice to beneficiary within 10 calendar days of identifying need for person to be facilitated enrolled If no answer or person does not opt out by last day before effective date of facilitated enrollment, submit 61 transaction to move to MA -PD plan Who needs to be moved Full dual who newly enrolls in MA -only plan Beneficiary in MA -only plan who recently became Medicaid eligible and is thus newly full dual Non-full dual with LIS who newly enrolls in MA -only plan Beneficiary in MA -only plan who recently became LIS - eligible Who does not need to be moved Those who have already opted out Those with RDS Those in \"800 series\" employer sponsored plans Those in employer sponsored plans (other than \"800 series\" plans) Those who have already opted out Those with RDS Those in \"800 series\" employer sponsored group plans Those in employer sponsored plans (other than \"800 series\" plans) Data to identify those in MA -only plan who need to be moved to MA -PD plan Monthly MA full dual file or on MMR with dual status code 02, 04, or 08 LIS data ( DTRR or monthly LIS history report): Premium subsidy = 25%, 50%, 75% OR Premium subsidy = 100 and LIS copay = 4 (15%) OR Premium subsidy = 100 and LIS copay = 1 , 2, or 3, and person is not on MA full dual file or on MMR with dual status code 02, 04, or 08 71 Auto -Enrollment of Full Duals Facilitated Enrollment of Other LIS Plan Into Which Beneficiary Should be Enrolled MA-PD plan with the lowest combined Part C and D premium MA-PD plan with the lowest combined Part C and D premium Notice to send Exhibit 27 (27a if applicable) Exhibit 28 (28a if applicable) Effective date First day of month person qualified for LIS (will be retroactive) Cannot be prior to start of enrollment in the MA -only plan First day of second month after person identified as needing enrollment Cannot be prior to start of enrollment in the MA -only plan Opt out Document and do not enroll again in future.

First day of month prior to effective date of the enrollment Election type Code Z = MA auto -enrollment period* U = Dual/LIS Special Enrollment Period Enrollment Source Code E (MA -submitted auto - enrollment)* F (MA -submitted facilitated enrollment) * Use of the enrollment period of \"Z\" and enrollment source code of \"E\" permits these 61 transactions for retroactive auto -enrollments to bypass normal MARx suspension of proce ssing for retroactive effective dates (i.e. they will process immediately). 40.1.6 - Additional Enrollment Request Mechanisms for Employer/Union Sponsored Coverage MA organizations may choose to accept voluntary enrollment requests directly from the employer or unions who sponsor MA coverage for its members in any of the enrollment mechanisms described in this guidance (except auto or facilitated enrollment). In ad dition, the MA organization may also accept enrollment requests using either the optional enrollment request mechanism or group enrollment process described in this section. It is the MA organization's responsibility to ensure that all applicable MA enro llment requirements are met, regardless of the process utilized, as required by CMS. In any case, the enrollment requests 72 provided to the MA organization by the employer or union will reflect the choice of retiree coverage individuals made using their employer's or union's process for selecting a health plan. For enrollment s process ed us ing the SEP EGHP , the application date on the enrollment transaction submitted to CMS is the first day of the month prior to the effective date of enrollment into the employer or union group -sponsored plan. For the purposes of providing notices and meeting other timefram e requirements provided in this guidance, use the date the organization receives the request. 40.1.6.1 - Group Enrollment Mechanism CMS will allow an MA organization to accept enrollment requests into an employer or union sponsored MA plan using a group enrollment process in which beneficiaries enroll in an employer or union sponsored MA plan. Beneficiaries participate in this process through advance notification that provides each individual with all the information necessary to make an informed choice . Furthermore, the process must provide CMS with any information the employer/union has on other insurance coverage for the purposes of coordination of benefits. It is the MA organization's responsibility to ensure the group enrollment process meets all applicable MA enrollment requirements. MA organizations must ensure that any contracts and other arrangements and agreements with employers and unions intending to use the group enrollment process make these requirements clear. The group enrollment proces s must include providing the following information to each beneficiary as follows: Beneficiaries participate in the group enrollment mechanism by receiving an advance notice that the employer/union intends to enroll them for a prospective coverage effectiv e date in an MA plan that the employer/union is sponsoring; and Clear instruction that the beneficiary may affirmatively opt out of such enrollment; explaining the process to opt -out; and any consequences to employer or union benefits opting out would bring; and This notice must be provided by the MA organization, or the employer or union acting on its behalf, not less than 21 calendar days prior to the effective date of the beneficiary's enrollment in the employer/union sponsored MA plan; and Additional ly, the information provided to each beneficiary must include a Summary of Benefits offered under the employer/union sponsored MA plan, as well as an explanation of how to get more information about the MA plan, and an explanation on how to contact Medicar e for information on other Medicare h ealth plan options that might be available to the beneficiary; and Each individual must also receive in the group enrollment notice materials the information contained in Exhibit 2 under the heading \"Please Read & Sign Below.\" The organization must ensure all of the above requirements are met prior to submission of the enrollment transactions to CMS. For enrollment s process ed us ing the SEP EGHP, the application date on the enrollment transaction submitted to CMS i s the first day of the month prior to the effective date of the group enrollment. This will ensure that any subsequent beneficiary-generated enrollment request will supersede the group enrollment in CMS systems. 73 The employer or union must provide in the g roup enrollment file(s) all the information required for the MA organization to submit a complete enrollment request transaction to CMS , including permanent residence information (refer to Appendix 2 of this chapter for a complete list of the required data elements and any other relevant CMS systems guidance). Records must be maintained as outlined in \u00a760.9 of this chapter. 40.1.6.2 - Optional Mechanism For MA Group -sponsored plan Enrollment This enrollment request mechanism is optional for MA organizati ons and may not be required. Therefore, MA organizations may specify the employers or unions, if any, from which they will accept this enrollment request format. It is the MA organization's responsibility to ensure that the process it uses, as well as the process used by the employer or union, meets the following requirements: The MA organization must inform its Regional Office Account Manager of its intent to use this mechanism and identify the employer group(s) or union(s) for which it will be accepting enrollments made in this manner. The enrollment information (i.e., the electronic file) submitted to the MA organization by an employer or union (or TPA) must accurately reflect the employer's or union's record of the election of coverage made by each ind ividual according to the processes the employer or union has in place, and may be accepted without a paper MA enrollment request form. Sales package minimum information requirements are not changed by using this option. These include, but are not limit ed to, providing the applicable rules of the MA organization. Each individual's enrollment request must clearly denote his/her agreement to abide by the MA organization rules, certify his/her receipt of required disclosure information and include authoriz ation by the beneficiary for the disclosure and exchange of necessary information between the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (and its designees) and the MA organization. The requirements for all other information provided to enrollees, both pre - and post -enrollment, are unchanged by this option and must be satisfied. The enrollment request transaction must include all the data necessary for the MA organization to determine each individual's eligibility to make an enrollment request as describ ed in \u00a720 of this chapter of the MMCM. Agreements with employer groups or unions should identify required data elements. A detailed list of these elements is provided in Appendix 2. This alternate enrollment request mechanism is used in place of paper MA enrollment request forms and does not require a signature. For purposes of compatibility with existing instructions in this chapter, the application date of enrollments processed using the SEP EGHP will be the first day of the month prior to the effective date of enrollment into the employer/union sponsored plan. This will ensure that any subsequent beneficiary -generated enrollment request will supersede the enrollment submitted by the employer or union. Effective date calculation of voluntary enrollment requests and the collection and submission of enrollment requests to CMS will follow existing procedures. 74 To accept electronic records of employer or union enrollment requests, the MA organization must, at minimum, comply with the CMS security policies regarding the acceptable method of encryption utilized to provide for data security, confidentiality and integrity, and authentication and identification procedures to ensure both the sender and recipient of the data are known to each other and are authorized to receive and decrypt the information. (See the CMS web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/informationsecurity for additional information.) The employer's or union's record of the request to enroll must exist in a format that can be easily, accurately and quickly reproduced for later reference by each individual member, the MA organization and/or CMS, as necessary, and be maintained (by the em ployer/union or the MA organization, as they agree) following the guidelines for MA enrollment request forms (see \u00a760.9). Included in this requirement is the MA organization's record of information received from the employer or union. 40.1. 7 - Enrollment for Beneficiaries in Qualified State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (SPAPs) CMS will allow MA organizations to accept enrollment requests in an agreed -upon electronic file format from qualified SPAPs, provided the SPAP has met the following requirem ents: The SPAP must attest, as required by \u00a740.2.1 of this guidance, that it has the authority under state law to enroll on behalf of its members. The SPAP must coordinate with the MA Organization to provide the required data elements for the organiza tion to process and submit an enrollment request to CMS. The SPAP must provide a notice to its members in advance of submitting the requests that explains that it is enrolling on their behalf, how the enrollment works with the SPAP and how individuals can decline such enrollment. In return, MA organizations that agree to accept mass enrollment requests from SPAPs are required to process them like any other enrollment and in accordance with notification timeframes. Additionally, the organization must ensu re the SPAP has met the above requirements prior to submission of the enrollment transaction to CMS. It is important for the MA organization to work with the SPAP in the event that the organization encounters any problems processing the enrollment request in the format provided. Because the SPAP is the authorized representative of the beneficiary, the organization is responsible for following up with the SPAP if the enrollment is incomplete in any way (to obtain missing information) or if the enrollment i s conditionally rejected due to the existence of employer or union sponsored drug coverage (to confirm that the individual understands the implications of enrolling in a Part D plan). Special note for SPAP enrollment requests during the AEP - For enroll ment processing purposes, the application date on the enrollment transaction submitted to CMS for the AEP must be set to October 15th. This will ensure that subsequent beneficiary -generated enrollment requests made during the AEP will supersede the SPAP en rollment in CMS systems. 40.1.8 - Re-Assignment of Certain LIS Bene ficiaries CMS has the discretion to re -assign LIS beneficiaries, including situations in which their current MA plan will terminate. CMS will announce its intent to conduct reassignment in the Call Letter. CMS will 75 conduct the reassignment in the fall of each year, and ensure all affected LIS beneficiaries are notified. Affected MA organizations are not responsible for initiating any disenrollment transactions for reassigned beneficiaries . Gaining PDP sponsor s are only responsible for responding to the CMS enrollment transaction promptly when they receive it and for providing appropriate beneficiary notices and materials, as described below. A. Population to be Re -Assigned CMS will reassign all current LIS enrollees in terminating MA plans. This includes non-renewing MA only plans, as well as MA -PD plans and MA PFFS plans. CMS will perform this reassignment when plan benefit packages are being non- renewed in their entirety , as well as MA plans that will continue but have service area reductions (SARs). In the case of an MA -only or MA -PD plan with a SAR, reassignment will only be performed for counties that will no longer be served by the plan in the following year). Beneficiaries who have LIS this year and will continue to do so next year will be included in this reassignment process, regardless of whether the individual was assigned to or vol untarily enrolled in a plan. The only exception is when an LIS beneficiary in an MA -PFFS plan that does not offer drugs is concomitantly enrolled in a stand- alone PDP. In these cases the beneficiary will not be reassigned. Reassignment is not performed for LIS beneficiaries in a non -renewing MA -only or MA -PD plan in the U.S. Terri tories, or in an employer -sponsored MA -only or MA -PD plan. The actual reassignment process is typically run on a single day in mid -October. CMS will only reassign beneficiaries who meet the above criteria as of the day of the reassignment run. CMS does not subsequently \"sweep\" for individuals who may meet the criteria at later points in time. B. Re -assignment Process CMS will reassign LIS beneficiaries from a non- renewing MA plan or MA plan with a SAR to a stand -alone prescription drug plan (PDP). Be neficiaries retain the option to elect another MA plan. CMS will attempt to reassign beneficiaries to a PDP offered by the same organization that offers the MA plan in which they are currently enrolled , wherever possible. CMS will identify PDPs that qu alify to receive reassignment and are sponsored by the same parent organization (see \u00a740.1.5 in Chapter 3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual for details on PDPs to which beneficiaries will be reassigned as well as for the responsibilities of those \"gaining\" PDPs ). If the organization has more than one such plan in that region, CMS will randomly reassign beneficiaries among those plans. If the organization does NOT offer a qualifying PDP, CMS will randomly reassign affected beneficiaries to PDP sponsors that have at least one qualifying PDP in that region. CMS will follow the two -step process used under auto/facilitated enrollment (i.e. random distribution first at the sponsor level, then randomly among qualifying plans within the sponsor ). C. CMS Notification to Beneficiaries CMS will ensure that all beneficiaries being re -assigned are notified. These notices will be on blue paper , and will instruct beneficiaries who are being reassigned because of a premium increase to 76 contact their current plan if they wish to remain with the plan for the following year. Per section 1860 D-14 (c) of the Social Security Act , CMS will also provide reassigned beneficiaries with information on formulary differences between the individual's former plan and new plan (with respect to the individual's drug regimen), and a description of the right to coverage determination, exception, reconsideration, appeal or grievance. D. Plan Communication to Affected Beneficiaries Non-renewing MA plans or MA plans wit h a SAR are not required to send any beneficiary notices specific to the reassignment process. Please refer to the Call Letter for details on general notification requirements related to non -renewals and SARs. \"Gaining\" PDPs are responsible for providin g enrollment confirmation (See Exhibit 29 of Chapter 3 of the Prescription Drug Manual) and enrollment materials to beneficiaries within 10 calendar days of receiving confirmation of reassignment on a D TRR. 40.1.9 - Simplified (Opt -In) Enrollment Mechanis m (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) This mechanism permits an MA organization to use data it has from its non -Medicare lines of business (commercial, Marketplace, Medicaid, etc.) to obtain some of the information it would normally need to receive from the beneficiary in the enrollment reques t. The organization is required to obtain any data necessary from the individual that it doesn't have from its data sharing. Use of this mechanism is not required. It is up to the MA organization whether it has the capability and want s to share data betw een its Medicare and non -Medicare lines of business. MA organizations may only offer simplified enrollment to individual s who: Are i n their ICEP based on their initial enrollment in Medicare; Are e nrolled in any type of non-Medicare plan under the same or ganization (or an entity under the same parent organization as the MA organization); and Do not have a break in coverage between the non-Medicare plan and the MA plan. The MA organization identifies individuals who are enrolled in its non-Medicare coverage, nearing Medicare eligibility (or recently enrolled), and in their ICEP. It may conduct outreach to these current members and offer them the opportunity to enroll in their plan. Outreach efforts are considered marketing, and should clearly articulate the various plan offerings, plan structure, premium, costs, network, etc. MA organizations may offer simplified enrollment via paper, telephone or electronically, as outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 40.1, 40.1.1 through 40.1.3. For telephonic or electro nic requests , the plan may limit the data to be collected from the applicant to those items it does not already have. The MA organization must collect the following data for the simplified enrollment: Minimal personal data sufficient for the MA organizat ion to correctly identify the current member and his or her information within its systems; 77 Medicare number; Name of the MA plan selected for enrollment; Statement of a language or alternate format preference (beneficiary response is optional; does not effect enrollment if not completed ); Applicant's acknowledgement of the following items: o The plan has a contract with the federal government; o Sales agents/brokers may be compensated if they are helping the individual to enroll; o Release of information to Medic are and other plans, as necessary. Information may be used for research and other purposes, as allowed under federal law and regulations; o Obtaining benefits and services from the plan in order to be covered; o Maintain enrollment in both Part A and B; o Information provided in the enrollment request is correct; intentionally falsifying information will result in disenrollment; and o Understanding that completion/signature indicates an understanding of the enrollment application, and that authorized represen tatives have legal authority to complete the enrollment request. Signature or attestation of intent to enroll and , as applicable, from an authorized representative acting on the beneficiary's behalf, contact information; and Any other data the MA organiza tion doesn't already have in its records that is necessary to meet the requirements in Appendix 2. Organizations are encouraged , but are not required , to request premium payment method information in the simplified enrollment request. In the absence of a stated preference, individuals are to be placed in direct billing status , as outlined in \u00a740.2.M . Additionally, the parameters outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 40.1.1 through 40.1.3 must be met based on the method of the simplified enrollment request (telephonic, electronic, or paper). Enrollment s requested using this mechanism are the same as any other new ICEP enrollment the plan receives and should be processed similarly. Example: Mr. Smith is turning 65 in June 2018 and is en rolled in commercial coverage with an organization named Good Insurance. Good Insurance identifies in its records that Mr. Smith's Medicare Part A and B Initial Enrollment Period begins March 2018. Based on its data from Mr. Smith's commercial enrollment, Good Insurance knows that Mr. Smith lives in the service area of MA plans that Good Insurance offers. A representative of Good Insurance calls Mr. Smith in May 2018 and identifies herself as his commercial health insurance plan. Using the plan's internal protocols, she confirm his identity on the call. In this call, she inform s Mr. Smith that because he's soon to be eligible for Medicare, he can enroll in a plan that Good Insurance offers just for people with Medicare. She provide s information on Good I nsurance MA plans available in Mr. Smith's area and ask s if he is interested in enrolling in one of the se or learning more. Mr. Smith expresses his interest in enrolling in Good Insurance's MA plan with prescription drugs. Good Insurance already has Mr. Smith's personal information via its internal systems and , while on the call , the representative obtains what is needed for the MA enrollment that Good Insurance doesn't already have. The representative uses this information to complete the telephonic enrollment request in Good Insurance's internal MA enrollment system. Good Insurance confirms the MA plan Mr. Smith 78 wants to enroll in and asks for his Medicare number. Good Insurance explains the legal requirements for enrollme nt, release of information, and confirms Mr. Smith's understanding and acknowledgement/approval to process the request. Good Insurance also provides information to Mr. Smith to process his disenrollment from the commercial coverage to be effective as of M ay 31, 2018. Good Insurance processes the telephonic enrollment the same as other received requests and submits the enrollment transaction to CMS. Mr. Smith's MA plan coverage will begin on June 1, 2018, when his Medicare coverage begins. 40.2 - Processi ng the Enrollment Request 42 CFR 422.60 2, Issued: August 12, 20 20; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2021) If an individual completes an enrollment request during a face -to-face interview, the MA organization may ask to see the individual's Medicare card to verify the spelling of the name, and to confirm the correct recording of Medicare Number, and entitlement dates for Medicare Part A and Part B. The individual does not have to show or provide the Medicare card or other evidence when submitting the request. The other forms of evidence as listed in item \"B\" are only requested when the enrollment request doesn't include the Medicare Number and the plan is unable to locate the individual in CMS systems. For processing all enrollment requests, the MA organization must verify Medicare entitlement as described in item \"B\" below in this section. Appendix 2 lists all the elements that must be provided in order to consider an enrollment request \"complete.\" If the MA organization receives an enrollment request that contains the required elements, the MA organization must consider the enrollment complete even if the optio nal data elements on the enrollment request are not provided . If an MA organization has received CMS approval for an enrollment request that contains data elements in addition to those included in Appendix 2, then the enrollment request is considered compl ete even if those additional elements are not provided . If an MA organization receives an enrollment request that does not have all necessary elements required in order to consider it complete, it must not immediately deny the enrollment. The MA organizat ion must always check available systems (i.e. BEQ, MARx online query) for information to complete an enrollment before requiring the beneficiary to provide the missing information. For example, if a beneficiary failed to fill out the \"sex\" field on the enr ollment request and the MA organization has access to this information via available systems , the organization must use that source to complete the application instead of request ing the information from the beneficiary. If the required but missing informat ion is not available via CMS systems, the enrollment request is considered incomplete and the MA organization must follow the procedures outlined in \u00a740.2.2 in order to complete the enrollment request. For EGHP enrollees, the MA Organization may choose to accept enrollment requests as described in \u00a740.1.2 or \u00a740.1.6. All required elements as listed in Appendix 2 must be included in the record of the enrollment request provided by the group for the enrollment request to be considere d complete (except signature). Follow the procedures outlined in \u00a740.2.2 to address incomplete enrollment requests. For paper, telephone and electronic enrollment requests, all required elements as listed in Appendix 2 must be included. The \"Beneficiary Signature and/or Authorized Representative Signature\" element 79 for a paper request is satisfied with a pen-and-ink signature, for a telephone request it is satisfied with a verbal attestation of intent to enroll, and for an electronic reque st it is satisfied with an electronic signature or a clear and distinct step that requires the applicant to activate an \"Enroll Now,\" or \"I Agree,\" type of button or tool. Follow the procedures outlined in \u00a740.2.2 to address incomplete enrollment requests. Electronic signatures have the same legal effect and validity as pen- and-ink signatures. An MA organization utilizing electronic signatures in electronic enrollment must, at a minimum, comply with the CMS security policies. For more information on the re quirements for legally binding electronic signatures, see the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a77001, and \"Use of Electronic Signatures in Federal Organization Transactions\" published by the CIO Council. The following s hould also be considered when completing an enrollment: A. Permanent Residence Information - The MA organization must determine whether or not the enrollee resides within the MA plan's service area. If an individual puts a Post Office Box as his or her p lace of residence on the enrollment request, the MA organization must consider the enrollment request incomplete and must contact the individual to determine place of permanent residence. If the applicant claims permanent residency in two or more states or if there is a dispute over where the individual permanently resides, the MA organization should consult the State law in which the MA organization operates and determine whether the enrollee is considered a resident of the State. Refer to \u00a710 for a definition of \"evidence of permanent residence,\" and \u00a720.3 for more information on determining residence for homeless individuals. Individuals for whom the Batch Eligibility Query (BEQ) or MARx online query (M232 screen) reflects an inc arcerated status , that beneficiary is considered to resid e outside of the service area and are, therefore, not eligible to enroll. B. Entitlement Information and Medicare Number - 42 CFR 422.50(a)(1) (Rev. 2, Issued: August 12, 20 20; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2021) Following the procedures outlined in the CMS Plan Communications User Guide, MA organizations must verify Medicare entitlement using the Batch Eligibility Query (BEQ) process or MARx online query (M232 screen) for al l enrollment requests, except enrollment requests from a current enrollee of an MA plan who is requesting enrollment into another MA plan offered by the same parent organization with no break in coverage (i.e. \"switching plans\"). Individuals are not req uired to provide evidence of entitlement to Medicare Part A and enrollment in Part B with the enrollment request. If the systems (BEQ or MARx online query) indicate that the individual is entitled to Medicare Part A and is enrolled in Part B, no further documentation of Medicare entitlement is needed from the individual. 80 CMS systems are updated within two business days of SSA processing new or changed Part A or Part B entitlement for a Medicare beneficiary . The CMS systems are the most up -to-date data rega rding Medicare entitlement for the beneficiary. The Medicare Number will be assigned a t the time CMS first receives entitlement information for a new beneficiary . In the event that the enrollment request doesn't include the Medicare Number and the plan i s unable to locate the individual in the BEQ or MARx online query, the organization should consider the enrollment request incomplete and follow \u00a7 40.2.2. The individual may provide the Medicare Number to the organization verbally or in writing. Examples of documents the beneficiary may send to the plan which display the Medicare Number (and entitlement information) include: Medicare card; Medicare Award notice from SSA (shows Medicare entitlement dates only); Benefit Verification notice from SSA (includes Medicare Number and entitlement start dates) ; Medicare card information from the indi vidual's MyMedicare.gov account; and A notice from CMS regarding change in Medicare Number. NOTE: If the beneficiary provides any of the notices listed above, the date on the letter should be no more than two months before the enrollment request was received by the organization. If there is a discrepancy between the entitleme nt information in a document and the information in CMS' systems, use the data in CMS systems to determine eligibility for enrollment. For auto- and facilitated enrollments, as described in \u00a740.1.5 of this chapter, entitlement verification is deemed compl ete, as the individual is already an MA enrollee. C. Effective Date of Coverage - The MA organization must determine the effective date of coverage as described in \u00a730.5 for all enrollment requests . If the individual fills out an enrollment form in a fa ce-to-face interview, then the MA organization representative may advise the individual of the proposed effective date, but must also stress to the individual that it is only a proposed effective date and that the individual will hear directly from the MA organization to confirm the actual effective date. The MA organization must notify the member of the effective date of coverage prior to the effective date (refer to \u00a740.4 for more information and a description of exceptions to this rule). With the excep tion of some SEPs and when election periods overlap, beneficiaries may not choose their effective date (effective dates are described in \u00a730.5). Instead, the MA organization is responsible for assigning the appropriate effective date based on the election period. During face -to-face enrollments, the MA organization staff are responsible for ensuring that a beneficiary does not choose an effective date that is not allowed under the requirements outlined in \u00a730.5. If a beneficiary completes an enrollment req uest with an unallowable effective date, or if the MA organization allowed the beneficiary to choose an unallowable effective date, the MA organization must notify the beneficiary in a timely manner and explain that the enrollment must be processed with a different effective date. The organization should resolve the issue with the beneficiary as to the correct effective date, and the notification must be documented. If 81 the beneficiary refuses to have the enrollment processed with the correct effective date, the beneficiary can cancel the enrollment request according to the procedures outlined in \u00a760.2.1. MA organizations must ensure enrollees have access to plan benefits as of the effective date of enrollment the MA organization has determined and may not d elay provision of plan benefits in anticipation of the submission to or reply from CMS systems. For auto - and facilitated enrollments, refer to \u00a740.1.5 of this chapter for more information. D. Health Related Information - MA organizations may not ask health screening questions during completion of the enrollment request. MA organizations are only permitted to send health assessment forms after enrollment. However, MA organizations may ask very limited health status questio ns related to a beneficiary's eligibility to join an MA plan, such as whether the individual is enrolled in Medicaid, or is cu rrently admitted to a certified Medicare/Medicaid institution. Queries for this information are included on the model EGHP form in Exhibit 2. These queries are not considered to be health screening questions. T he responses to these questions must not have an effect on eligibility to enroll in an MA plan. Exception for certain MA -SNPs - An SNP that is being offered to individuals wi th certain medical conditions (i.e. an SNP for chronic and disabling conditions), as permitted by CMS, will need to establish that the individual has such a condition to determine eligibility for enrollment in that specific SNP. Refer to \u00a720.11 for more information. E. Statements of Understanding - As outlined in \u00a720.5, a beneficiary must understand and agree to abide by the rules of the MA plan in order to be eligible to enroll. If the MA organization lists such statements in an itemized format, it is a t the MA organization's discretion to decide whether it will: Consider the beneficiary signature on the form (or completion of the enrollment request process) to signify that the individual has read and understands the statements (as shown on Exhibits 1, 1b, 2 and 3); or Have fields next to the statements and require the applicant's initials next to each statement. The MA organization must apply the policy consistently. If the MA organization requires the initials and the applicant fails to initial his/ her understanding of each item listed on the enrollment form , the MA organization may contact the applicant to clarify the MA organization rules in order to complete the enrollment form. The MA organization must document the contact and annotate the outcom e of the contact. If the MA organization is unable to contact the applicant to ensure their understanding, the enrollment form would be considered incomplete. F. Applicant Signature and Date - The individual must sign the enrollment form or complete the enrollment request mechanism. If the individual is unable to do so, a legal representative must sign the enrollment form (refer to \u00a740.2.1 for more detail) or complete the enrollment request mechanism. If a legal representative enrolls an individual, the l egal representative must attest to having the authority under State law to do so, and confirm that a copy of the proof of court - 82 appointed legal guardian, durable power of attorney, or proof of other authorization required by State law that empowers the ind ividual to effect an enrollment request on behalf of the applicant is available and can be presented upon request by the MA organization or CMS. The individual and/or legal representative must indicate his/her relationship to the individual and date he/she signed the enrollment form or completed the enrollment request; however, if he/she inadvertently fails to include the date on the enrollment request, then the date the MA organization receives the enrollment request may serve as the signature date of the form. If a paper enrollment form is submitted and the signature is not included, the MA organization may verify with the individual with a phone call and document the contact, rather than return the paper enrollment form as incomplete. The documentation of this contact will complete the enrollment request (assuming all other required elements are complete). Certain enrollment request mechanisms do not include a pen -and-ink, or \"wet,\" signature. The signature element listed in Appendix 2 is satisfied by specific procedures provided for the other enrollment request mechanism s in this chapter; for example, see \u00a740.1. 2 for information about enrollment. For auto and facilitated enrollment as described in \u00a740.1.5, an enrollee signature is not required. G. Other Signatures - If the MA organization representative helps the individual fill out the enrollment form, then the MA organization representative must clearly indicate his/her name on the enrollment form. However, the MA organization representative doe s not have to include his/her name on the form when: He/she pre -fills the individual's name and mailing address when the individual has requested that an enrollment form be mailed to him/her, He/she fills in the \"office use only\" block, and/or He/she corrects information on the enrollment form after verifying information (see \"final verification of information\" below). The MA organization representative does have to include his/her name on the form if he/she pre-fills any other information, including t he individual's phone number. H. Old Enrollment Requests - If the MA organization receives an enrollment request that was executed more than 30 calendar days prior to the MA organization's receipt of the request, the MA organization is encouraged to contact the individual to re -affirm intent to enroll prior to processing the enrollment and to advise the beneficiary of the upcoming effective date. I. Determining the Application Date - The MA organization must date all enrollment requests as soon as they are initially received. Except for enrollment requests submitted via the CMS Online Enrollment Center, requests made by the group enrollment mechanism and auto or facilitated enrollments, the date the enrollment request is initially received is equivalent to the \"application date\" (refer to \u00a710 for definitions of \"receipt request,\" \"completed 83 enrollment request\" and \"application date\"). If the enrollment request is not complete at the time it is received, then the additional documentation required for the enrollment request to be complete must be dated as soon as it is received. Appendix 3 describes the appropriate application date to include in the enrollment transaction submitted to CMS under various conditions. J. Final Verification of Information - Some MA organizations verify information before enrollment information has been transmitted to CMS. In these cases the MA organization may find that it must make corrections to an individual's paper enro llment form. The MA organization should make those corrections, and the individual making those corrections must place his/her initials and the date next to the corrections. A separate \"correction\" sheet, signed and dated by the individual making the corre ction, may be used by the MA organization (in place of the initialing procedure described in the prior sentence), and should become a part of the enrollment file. These types of corrections will not result in the MA organization having to co-sign the enrol lment form. K. Premiums Owed to the MAO - For individuals enrolling in an MA -only plan, an MA organization may choose to wait for an enrolling individual's payment of the MA -only plan premium before considering the enrollment request complete. An MA organization cannot consider an enrollment request incomplete if the individual enrolling has indicated that he or she wants the plan premium withheld from an SSA benefit check. For enrollment into either an MA -only or MA -PD plan, an MA organization may consider an enrollment request incomplete if there are premium amounts due to the organization from a prior enrollment, whether or not premium withhold from an SSA benefit check is selected. The option chosen by the MA plan to consider the application com plete or incomplete must be applied consistently to all potential enrollees of the plan. Optional Exception for Dual -Eligible Individuals and Individuals who Qualify for the Low Income Subsidy For enrollment requests submitted by dually eligible individuals and individuals who qualify for the low income subsidy (LIS), an MA organization may consider an enrollment request complete if there are premium amounts due to the organization from a prior enrollment, even if the MA organization has a policy to consider such enrollment requests incomplete. The MA organization has the discretion to implement this exception to dually eligible individuals and individuals who qualify for LIS within each of its MA plans. If the MA organization offers this excepti on in one of its plans, it must apply the policy to all such individuals who request enrollment in that MA plan. L. Completed Enrollment Requests - Once the enrollment request is complete, the MA organization must transmit the enrollment to CMS within th e time frames prescribed in \u00a740.3, and must send the individual the information described in \u00a740.4 within the prescribed time frames. There are instances when a complete enrollment can turn out to be legally invalid. These instances are outlined in \u00a740.6. M. Plan Premium Payment and Premium Withhold Options - 84 42 CFR 422.60(c)(1) (Rev. 2, Issued: August 12, 20 20; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2021) MA organizations may include on all enrollment request mechanisms (except the simplified enrollment mechanism) the option for individuals to: 1) pay plan premiums by being billed directly by the plan or 2) have the premiums withheld from their SSA benefit check. The plan may also choose to offer other payment methods, s uch as automatic deduction from the individual's bank or other financial institution or from the individual's credit card. The enrollment mechanism can also advise that if the individual does not select a premium payment option, the default action will be direct bill. MA-only plans that do not have a premium may omit the \"Paying your Plan Premium\" section from their enrollment request mechanism. MA -PD plans that do not have a plan premium may include, at minimum, the direct bill and SSA withhold options for those individuals subject to the LEP to select how they will pay this penalty (premium); however, such plans may also include introductory language to indicate that the premium payment section applies only to individuals subject to the LEP. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) enrollees may also submit requests to have their premiums withheld from their RRB retirement payments. Organizations may choose to offer this option on all enrollment mechanisms as well. MA-PD plans can also include on the enrollment request a statement in the premium payment section advising those individuals who qualify for extra help that, if the extra help does not cover the entire plan premium, the individual is responsible for the amount that Medicare does not cover. Model language has been provided on Exhibits 1, 1c, 3 and 3a to reflect the se options. In addition, suggested optional language for MA -PD plans without premiums has also been provided. N. Additional Information for MA -PD Enrollment Requests - Individuals enrolling in a Part D plan must disclose any other existing coverage for prescription drugs. O. U.S. Citizenship or Lawful Presence Information - MA organizations must use the CMS Batch Eligibility Query (BEQ) (individual or batch submission ) or, via online access, the MARx M232 screen, to verify eligibility on the basis of incarceration status or unlawful presence status . An exception to this are enrollment requests from a current enrollee of an MA plan who is requesting enrollment into another MA plan offered by the same parent organization w ith no break in coverage (i.e., \"switching plans\"). Individuals are not required to provide evidence of U.S. citizenship or lawful presence status with the enrollment request, nor are MA organizations perm itted to request such information or documentation. The systems (BEQ or MARx online query) will indicate the lawful presence status of a non -U.S. citizen, including the start and, if applicable, the end date of the unlawful presence status of the individua l. 85 CMS eligibility queries will only reflect data for the existence of an unlawful presence status. When neither the BEQ nor the MARx online query shows any indication of unlawful presence in the U.S., the MA organization must treat the lack of informati on as confirmation of evidence of U.S. citizenship or lawful presence status. When either the BEQ or the MARx online query shows an indication of unlawful presence in the U.S. and the organization receives documentation of lawful presence from the applic ant, the plan cannot use this documentation to establish eligibility. If the MA organization is provided evidence of lawful presence by the applicant in the form of a document from the Department of Homeland Security or SSA and neither the BEQ nor the MAR x online query reflects this lawful presence status, the organization should refer the applicant to SSA to request that SSA update its records. 40.2.1 - Who May Complete an Enrollment or Disenrollment Request 42 CFR 422.60(c) A Medicare beneficiary is g enerally the only individual who may execute a valid request for enrollment in or disenrollment from an MA plan. However, another individual could be the legal representative or appropriate party to execute an enrollment or disenrollment request as the law of the State in which the beneficiary resides may allow. CMS will recognize State laws that authorize persons to make such request s for Medicare beneficiaries. For example, persons authorized under State law may be court -appointed legal guardians, persons having durable power of attorney for health care decisions or individuals authorized to make health care decisions under State surrogate consent laws, provided they have authority to act for the beneficiary in this capacity. If a Medicare beneficiary is unable to sign an enrollment form or disenrollment request or complete an enrollment request mechanism due to reasons such as physical limitations or illiteracy, State law would again govern whether another individual may execute the enrollment request on behalf of the beneficiary. Usually, a court -appointed guardian is authorized to act on the beneficiary's behalf. If there is uncertainty regarding whether another person may sign for a beneficiary, MA organizations should check State laws regarding the aut hority of persons to sign for and make health care treatment decisions for other persons. Where MA organizations are aware that an individual has a representative payee designated by SSA to handle the individual's finances, MA organizations should contact the representative payee to determine his/her legal relationship to the individual, and to ascertain whether he/she is the appropriate person, under State law, to execute the enrollment or disenrollment request. Representative payee status alone is not sufficient to enroll a Medicare beneficiary. When someone other than the Medicare beneficiar y completes an enrollment or disenrollment request, he or she must: 1) Attest to having the authority under State law to do so; 2) Confirm that proof of authorization, if any, required by State law that empowers the individual to make an enrollment or disenrollment request on behalf of the individual is available and can be provided upon request by CMS. MA organizations cannot require such documentation as a condition of enrollment or disenrollment ; and 3) Provide contact information. 86 The MA organizat ion must retain the record of this attestation as part of the record of the enrollment or disenrollment request. CMS provide s a sample attestation as part of the model MA enrollment form (Exhibit 1). If anyone has reason to believe that an individual mak ing an election on behalf of a beneficiary may not be authorized under State law to do so, the organization should contact its CMS account manager with all applicable documentation regarding State Law and the case in question. The account manager may reque st supporting documentation from the individual making the election. When an authorized representative completes an enrollment request on behalf of a beneficiary, the MA organization should inquire regarding the preference for the delivery of required not ifications and other plan materials (i.e. sending mail to the beneficiary directly or to the representative, or both) and make reasonable accommodations to satisfy these wishes. 40.2.2 - When the Enrollment Request Is Incomplete 42 CFR 422.50(a)(5) (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) When the enrollment request is incomplete, the MA organization must document all efforts to obtain additional documentation to complete the enrollment request and have an audit trail to document why the enrollment request needed additional documentation before it could be considered complete. The organization must make this determination and, within 10 calendar days of receipt of the enrollment request, must notify the individual that additional information is needed , unless the required but missing information can be obtained via CMS systems. This notification is not required for SNP enrollment requests for which the only missing information is confirmation of the applicant's special need s status. Note: An enrollment request is considered complete even if the only information missing is the eligibility for the election period . In such circumstances, the plan must contact the individual to assure they have a valid election period before pr ocessing the enrollment. (See Section 30 for more information regarding eligibility for election periods and Section 40 for enrollment processing requirements.) If the request is missing the Medicare Number, see \u00a740.2.B for more information. If a paper enrollment form is missing a signature, see \u00a740.2 F for more information. For incomplete ICEP enrollment requests received prior to the month of entitlement to Part A and enrollment in Part B, additional documentation to make the request complete must be received during the first three months of the ICEP, or within 21 calendar days of the request for additional information (whichever is later). For incomplete ICEP enrollment requests received during the month of entitlement to Part A and enrollment in Par t B or later, additional documentation to make the request complete must be received by the end of the month in which the enrollment request was initially received, or within 21 calendar days of the request for additional information (whichever is later). For incomplete AEP enrollment requests, additional documentation to make the request complete must be received by December 7 , or within 21 calendar days of the request for additional information 87 (whichever is later). For all other enrollment periods, add itional documentation to make the request complete must be received by the end of the month in which the enrollment request was initially received, or within 21 calendar days of the request for additional information (whichever is later). EXAMPLES: Ms. Stears' 65th birthday is April 20, 2011. She is eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B beginning April 1, 2011 and has decided to enroll in Part B beginning on April 1. Her ICEP begins on January 1, 2011 and ends on July 31, 2011. She submits an incomp lete ICEP enrollment request on January 15, 2011, and the MAO requests the required but missing information on January 20, 2011. The enrollment request must be denied if the required information is not received by March 31, 2011. Ms. Mohan's 65th birthda y is June 10, 2011. She is eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B beginning June 1, 2011 and has decided to enroll in Part B beginning on June 1. Her ICEP begins on March 1, 2011 and ends on September 30, 2011. She submits an incomplete ICEP enrollment request on July 5, 2011, and the MAO requests the required but missing information on July 7, 2011. The enrollment request must be denied if the required information is not received by July 31, 2011. When the MA organization receives an incomplete enrollm ent request near the end of either a month or an enrollment period, the use of the full 21 calendar day period to complete the request may extend beyond CMS systems plan submission \"cut -off\" date (these dates are provided in the CMS Plan Communications Use r Guide). MA organizations may utilize a code 61 enrollment transaction to directly submit the request to CMS as provided in the CMS Plan Communications User Guide. If additional documentation needed to make the enrollment request \"complete\" is not recei ved within allowable time frames, the organization must deny the enrollment using the procedures outlined in \u00a740.2.3. Requesting Information from the Beneficiary - To obtain information to complete the enrollment request, the MA organization must contact the individual to request the information within ten calendar days of receipt of the enrollment request. The organization may contact the beneficiary either in writing (see Exhibit 5 for a model letter) or orally. If the contact is made orally, the MA organization must document the contact and retain the documentation in its records. The MA organization must explain to the individual that s/he has 21 calendar days in which to submit the additional information or the enrollment will be denied. Since an inco mplete enrollment request is an invalid enrollment (as explained in \u00a740.6), if the additional documentation is not received within allowable time frames, the MA organization must send a denial of enrollment letter (see Exhibit 7). If all documentation is received within allowable time frames and the enrollment request is complete, the MA organization must transmit the enrollment to CMS within the time frames prescribed in \u00a740.3, and must send the individual the information described in \u00a740.4. 40.2.3 - MA Organization Denial of Enrollment MA organization denials occur before the organization has transmitted the enrollment to CMS. For enrollment requests that do not require additional information from the applicant, a n MA organization 88 must deny an enrollment within 10 calendar days of receiving the enrollment request based on its own determination of the ineligibility of the individual to elect the MA plan . For an incomplete enrollment request that require s information from the applicant and for which the applicant fails to provide the information within the required time frame, an MA organization must deny the enrollment within 10 calendar days of the expiration of the time frames described in \u00a740.2.2. Notice Requirement - The organiza tion must send notice of the denial to the individual that includes an explanation of the reason for denial (refer to Exhibit 7 for a model notice). This notice must be sent within ten calendar days of either 1) receipt of the enrollment request or 2) expi ration of the time frame for receipt of requested additional information, as described in the following examples: An MA organization receives an enrollment request from an individual on November 7 and determines on that same day that the individual is ineligible due to place of residence. The organization should send notice of denial within ten calendar days from November 7. An MA organization receives an enrollment request from an individual on January 7 and is unable to determine, through direct contact with the beneficiary or the beneficiary's authorized representative, that the beneficiary has a valid enrollment period available. The organization should send notice of denial within ten calenda r days from January 7. An MA organization receives an enrollment form on November 7 from an individual, identifies the enrollment form as incomplete, and notifies the individual of the need for additional information, on November 10. The beneficiary does n ot submit the information by December (as required under \u00a740.2.2), which means the organization must deny the enrollment. The organization should send notice of denial within ten calendar days from December 1 . 40.2.4 - MA-PD Enrollment When an Individual has Other Qualified Prescription Drug Coverage through an Employer or Union Retiree Drug Subsidy (RDS) Plan Sponsor CMS systems will compare MA -PD enrollment transactions to information CMS has regarding the existence of employer or union sponsored qualif ied prescription drug coverage for which the beneficiary is also being claimed for the Retiree Drug Subsidy (RDS). If there is a match indicating that the individual may have such other coverage, the enrollment will be conditionally rejected by CMS system s as incomplete. Within 10 calendar days of receipt of the Code 127 conditional rejection, the MA organization must contact the individual to confirm the individual's intent to enroll, and that the individual has discussed and understands the implicati ons of enrollment in a Part D plan on his or her employer or union coverage. Individuals will have 30 calendar days from the date they are contacted to respond. The organization must ensure that plan benefits are available to the individual as of the effec tive date of the initial enrollment request and m ust not delay the provision of plan benefits in anticipation of the applicant's confirmation of intent to enroll . The organization may contact the individual in writing (See Exhibit 6b) or by phone and must document this contact and retain it with the record of the individual's enrollment request. If the individual indicates that s/he is fully aware of any consequence to his/her employer or union coverage brought about by enrolling in the Part D Plan, and confirms s/he still wants to enroll, the MA organization must update the transaction with the appropriate \"flag\" (detailed instructions for this activity are included with CMS systems guidance) and re -submit it for 89 enrollment. The effective date of enrollmen t will be based upon the individual's initial enrollment request. This effective date may be retroactive in the event that the confirmation step occurs after the effective date. MA organizations may use the Code 61 enrollment transaction code to submit the enrollment transaction directly to CMS, as described in the Plan Communication Users Guide (PCUG). MA organizations are strongly encouraged to closely monitor their outreach efforts and to follow up with applicants prior to expiration of the 30 day time frame. If the individual does not respond in 30 days, or responds and declines the enrollment, the enrollment must be denied. A denial notice must be provided (see Exhibit 7). When an employer or union sponsored MA -PD plan is replacing an existing RDS pla n offered by that employer or union group, the MA organization may receive the Code 127 conditional rejection. In these cases , it is not necessary to contact each individual, as described above. The MA organization must resubmit the transactions updated wi th the appropriate flag. MA organizations should work in close collaboration with employer/union sponsors who are replacing RDS coverage with Part D coverage to ensure that all individuals are aware of the change and have the information they need. 40.3 - Transmission of Enrollments to CMS For all enrollment requests effective January 1, 2008, or later that the organization is not denying per the requirements in \u00a740.2.3, the MA organization must submit the information necessary for CMS to add the be neficiary to its records as an enrollee of the MA organization within 7 calendar days of receipt of the completed enrollment request. CMS system \"down\" days are included in the calculation of the 7 calendar days (refer to Appendix C of the Plan Communicati ons User Guide). For the purpose of assessing compliance with this requirement, CMS will count the enrollment request receipt date as \"day zero\" and the following day as \"day one.\" In the case of enrollment requests that are accepted after the MA organiza tion is enrolled to capacity, but as a vacancy occurs, the MA organization must submit the information within 7 calendar days after a vacancy has become available. All enrollment elections must be processed in chronological order by date of receipt of com pleted enrollment elections (refer to \u00a740.5 for procedures when the MA plan is closed for enrollment). MA organizations are encouraged to submit transactions by the earliest possible MA organization processing cutoff date (refer to the Plan Communications Users Guide (PCUG) ). However, if the organization misses the cutoff date, it must still submit the transactions within the required 7 calendar day time frame. NOTE: The requirement to submit the transaction within 7 calendar days does not affect the effective date of the individual's coverage under the plan, i.e., the effective date must be established according to the procedures outlined in \u00a7\u00a730.5 and 30.7 . More detail on how MA organizations must submit transmissions to CMS are contained in the Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plans Plan Communications User Guide . 90 40.4 - Information Provided to Member Much of the enrollment information that an MA organization must provide to the member must be sent prior to the effective date of coverage. However, some information will be sent after the effective date of coverage. A member's coverage begins on the effective date regardless of when the member receiv es all the information the plan sends. As discussed previously (\u00a740), the organization must provide required notices in response to information received from CMS on the D TRR that provides the earliest notification. Organizations may choose to send notific ations based on the availability of each Batch Completion Summary Status (BCSS) file if they desire. However, in no case may use of the BCSS for this purpose extend any timeframe established in this guidance. Organizations choosing to utilize the BCSS fo r certain required beneficiary notifications must do so consistently. The organization may provide the required notices described in \u00a7\u00a740.4.1 and 40.4.2 or may utilize a single (\"combination\") notice (see Exhibit s 4b and 4e ). The combination notice takes the place of separate acknowledgement and confirmation notices and, as such, requires expedited issuance. To use the combination notice, the organization must be able to provide this notice within 7 calendar days of the availability of the D TRR. Additional ly, when following this option to use the combination notice, if the organization is unable to ensure that the beneficiary will receive this combination notice prior to the enrollment effective date (or within timeframes for incomplete enrollment requests or enrollments received at the end of the month), the organization still must ensure that the beneficiary has the information required in \u00a740.4.1 within the timeframes described therein. If an individual's enrollment includes a request for SSA or RRB pre mium withhold and was processed after the monthly cut -off for payment , the organization must submit the request for premium withhold separate from the enrollment request . Plans should resubmit the request for premium withhold timely to assure the individua l can have premium withholding at the next possible effective date. Additionally, the organization must inform the individual that: If his/her request for premium withholding is approved, it will start in 1 -2 months; The effective date for premium withholding will not be retroactive; S/he will be responsible for paying the organization directly for all premiums due from the enrollment effective date until the month in which premium withholding begins; and For plans implementing \u00a750.3.1, f ailure to pay premiums for months in which premium withholding is not in effect will result in disenrollment from the plan. 40.4.1 - Prior to the Effective Date of Coverage 42 CFR 422.60 (e) (Rev. 2, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) Prior to the effective date of coverage , the MA organization must provide the member with all the necessary information about being a Medicare member of the MA organization, the MA organization 91 rules, and the member' s rights and responsibilities (an exception to this requirement is described in \u00a740.4.2) . The MA organization must also provide the following to the individual: For enrollment requests submitted via electronic enrollment or telephonic enrollment mechanism s (including the simplified enrollment mechanism) , evidence that the enrollment request was received (e.g. , a confirmation number). For paper enrollment requests, organizations are not required to provide evidence of receipt outside of the acknowledgement or combination notice outlined below. Organizations may choose to provide a confirmation number or other tracking mechanism indicating receipt of the paper enrollment request. However, organizations are expected to keep a copy of the paper enrollment for m and provide a copy upon request by the beneficiary. A notice acknowledging receipt of the completed enrollment request (refer to Exhibits 4, 4a, and 4c for model letters) and showing the effective date of coverage. This notice must be provided no later than 10 calendar days after receipt of the completed enrollment request (organizations choosing to use the combination notice, refer to 40.4 above) . Proof of health insurance coverage so that he/she may begin using plan services as of the effective date. This proof must include the 4Rx data necessary to access benefits. NOTE: This proof of coverage is not the same as the Evidence of Coverage document described in the Medicare Communications and Marketing Guidelines. The proof of coverage may be in the form of member ID cards, the enrollment form, and/or a notice to the member (refer to Exhibits 4, 4a, 4b and 4c, which are model letters with optional language that would allow the member to use the letter as evidence of health insurance coverage until he/she receives a member card). As of the effective date of enrollment, plan systems should indicate active membership. Regardless of whether an enrollm ent request is made in a face -to-face interview, by fax, by mail, or by other mechanisms defined by CMS, the MA organization must explain: The charges for which the prospective member will be liable, e.g., any premiums (this includes any Part D late enrol lment penalty), coinsurance, fees or other amounts; and any amount that is attributable to the Medicare deductible and coinsurance, if this information is available at the time the acknowledgement notice is issued (confirmation notices and combination ackn owledgement/confirmation notices must contain this information). The prospective member's authorization for the disclosure and exchange of necessary information between the MA organization and CMS. The lock -in requirement. The MA organization must also obtain an acknowledgment by the individual that he/she understands that care will be received through designated providers except for emergency services and urgently needed care. The potential for financial liability if it is found that the individual is not entitled to Medicare Part A and Part B at the time coverage begins and he/she has used MA plan services after the effective date. 92 The effective date of coverage and how to obtain services prior to the receipt of an ID card (if the MA organization has not yet provided the ID card). 40.4.2 - After the Effective Date of Coverage 42 CFR 422.62(e) (Rev. 2, Issued: August 12, 20 20; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2021) The CMS recognizes that in some instances the MA organization will be unable to provi de the materials and required notifications to new enrollees prior to the effective date, as required in \u00a740.4.1. These cases will generally occur when an enrollment request is received late in a month with an effective date of the first of the next month. In these cases, the MA organization still must provide the member all materials described in \u00a740.4.1 no later than 10 calendar days after receipt of the completed enrollment request. Additionally, the MA organization is also strongly encouraged to call these new members as soon as possible (such as within 1- 3 calendar days) to provide the effective date, the information necessary to access benefits and to explain the MA organization rules. The member's coverage will be active on the effective date regardl ess of whether or not the member has received all the information by the effective date. Acceptance/Rejection of Enrollment Once the MA organization receives a D TRR from CMS indicating whether the individual's enrollment has been accepted or rejected, the MA organization must notify the individual in writing of CMS' acceptance or rejection of the enrollment within ten calendar days of the DTRR that contains the earliest notification of the acceptance or rejection (see Exhibits 4d, 6, 6a, 6c, 6d and 8 for model letters). The enrollment confirmation notice must explain the charges for which the prospective member will be liable, e.g., any premiums, coinsurance, fees or other amounts; and any amount that is attributable to the Medicare deductible and coi nsurance. For those eligible for the low -income subsidy, the enrollment confirmation notice must specify the limits applicable to the level of subsidy to which the person is entitled. There are exceptions to this notice requirement for certain types of t ransaction rejections. These exceptions exist so as not to penalize the individual for a systems issue or delay, such as a plan transmission or keying error. In this case, the MA organization should not send a rejection notice and must request a retroactiv e enrollment from CMS (or its designee) within the timeframes provided in the Standard Operating Procedures for the CMS Retroactive Processing Contractor. If CMS (or its designee) is unable to process the retroactive enrollment due to its determination tha t the individual is not eligible , the MA organization must notify the individual of the rejection in writing within ten calendar days after CMS' (or its designee's) determination. Retroactive enrollments are covered in more detail in \u00a760.4. If an MA organization rejects an enrollment and later receives additional information from the individual substantiating his/her eligibility , the MA organization must obtain a new enrollment request from the individual in order to enroll the individual and must process the enrollment with a current (i.e., not retroactive) effective date. Refer to \u00a760.4 for more information regarding retroactive enrollments. 40.5 - Enrollment Processing During Closed Periods 42 CFR 422. 60(a)(2) and 422.60(b) (Rev. 1, Issued: July Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) 93 As described in \u00a740.3, an MA organization must process elections in order by date of receipt of completed enrollment election when it is open for enrollment. However, an MA organization may close an MA plan to OEP and OEPI enrollments or when it reaches a CMS -approved capacity limit. This section addresses procedures for handling enrollment requests that arrive at the MA organization when an MA plan is closed for enrollment, either through voluntary closure to OEP and OEPI enrollments or because a CMS -approved capacity limit has been reached, and for processing those enrollments when the MA plan re -opens or a vacancy occurs. If an MA organization believes its MA plan does not have the capacity to accept additional members, or as the MA plan enrollment grows and the MA organization estimates it may reach capacity during its next open enrollment period, the MA organization may request a CMS -approved limit on enrollment. A capacity limit allows an MA organization to close or limit enrollment for all election periods . Only with a reserved vacancy may an MA organization set aside vacancies for enrollment of conversions. 40.5.1 - Procedures After Reaching Capacity Limit 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 422.60(a)(2) and 422.60(b) (Rev. 1, Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) If the number of individuals who elect to enroll in an MA plan exceeds a CMS -approved capacity limit, then the MA organization may limit enrollment of these individuals, but only if it provides priority in acceptance. If an MA organization receives completed enrollment requests between the time it reaches its limit and the time CMS approves the limit, it may follow one of two options after it receives approval from CMS to limit enrollment: (1) Deny the enrollment due to the onset of the capacity limit, or (2) Place the enrollment on a waiting list to be processed as vacancies occur in the priority of acceptance. This priority requires that the MA organization process enrollments from individuals who elected the MA plan prior to CMS' determination that the capacity has been exceeded, in order based on date of receipt of the completed enrollment request, and in a manner that does not discriminate on the basis of any factor related t o health as described in 42 CFR \u00a7422.110. The MA organization must take the same action for all enrollment requests received. See below for procedures for following options 1 or 2. After the enrollments discussed in the above paragraph are acted upon, th e MA organization has similar options for handling any additional enrollment requests received while the plan is closed for enrollment. The MA organization may follow one of two options: (1) Deny the enrollment due to the capacity limit, or (2) Place the enrollment on a waiting list to be processed when the plan re -opens for enrollment. However, to ensure no discrimination is applied to applications processed, all MA organizations that use option 1 (i.e., deny enrollment) for enrollments discussed in the above paragraph, must continue to deny all enrollments received while the plan is closed for enrollment, and may not use option 2. The MA organization must take the same action for all enrollment forms received. In the case of enrollments received after the plan closes for enrollment, the date the MA plan re-opens becomes the \"receipt date\" of enrollment forms received when the plan was closed. 94 EXAMPLE: If the plan was closed in April and re -opens on May 1, then the receipt date of enrollment requests receiv ed in April is May 1. See below for procedures for following options 1 or 2. If the MA O rganization Uses Option 1 - It must notify the individual in writing that it is denying the enrollment, and should do so within ten calendar days after it receives the enrollment request or after the MA organization receives approval from CMS to limit enrollment (Exhibit 7). Please note that CMS encourages MA organizations to use this option if they expect that there will be no enrollment opportunities for longer than one month. This reduces the likelihood of multiple transactions and/or mistaken disenrollments that would occur if a potential applicant enrolls in another MA plan while waiting for the original MA plan to re -open. If the MA O rganization Uses Option 2 - It must notify the individual in writing that he/she has been placed on a waiting list, and should do so within ten calendar days after the MA organization receives the enrollment request or after the MA organization receives approval from CMS to limit enrol lment. The notice must also provide an estimated length of time that the individual will be on a waiting list and instruct the individual that he may cancel his enrollment before a vacancy occurs. As enrollment spaces become available, if the plan was clo sed for more than 30 calendar days since the receipt of the enrollment form, the MA organization must contact (orally or in writing) the individual to re -affirm the individual's intent to enroll before processing the enrollment. (The MA organization may ma ke this contact even if the plan was closed for less than 30 days.) Within ten calendar days after contacting the individual, the MA organization must send written notice of intent to not process the enrollment to all individuals who state they are no long er interested in being enrolled in the MA plan. For individuals who indicate their continued interest in enrollment, the MA organization must document the individual's expressed interest to continue enrollment. This may be done via phone contact report, n otation on the enrollment form, etc. There may be situations in which the MA organization has closed enrollment in a service area, yet receives an approval for a capacity limit for a portion of that same service area. Given that MA plans are either open o r closed to OEP and OEPI enrollments for an ENTIRE plan service area, any vacancies which may open up may only be filled by individuals making AEP, ICEP or SEP enrollment elections by applying the rules for accepting enrollments when MA plans are closed (s ee \u00a740.5.2 below). Further, it must take those individuals based upon enrollments received in chronological order. 40.5.2 - Procedures After Closing During the OEP and OEP I 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) As stated in \u00a730, an MA organization must accept all enrollment requests for its MA plans made during the AEP, ICEP, or SEP. However, an MA organization may not process OEP or OEP I enrollments for a plan when the pla n is closed to OEP and OEP I enrollments . If an MA plan is closed to OEP and OEP I enrollments and receives new OEP or OEP I enrollment requests or documentation to complete OEP enrollment requests already received by the MA 95 organization, then the MA organiz ation may do one of the following. The MA organization must take the same action for all enrollment forms received while the plan is closed: 1. Deny the enrollment; 2. Continue to accept the completed enrollment requests to be placed on a waiting list. If the MA Organization uses option #1 above - It must notify the individual in writing that it is denying the enrollment, and should do so within ten calendar days after it receives the enrollment request (Exhibit 7). Please note that CMS encourages MA o rganizations to use this option if they expect that there will be no enrollment opportunities for longer than one month. This reduces the likelihood of multiple transactions and/or mistaken disenrollments that would occur if a potential applicant enrolls i n another MA plan while waiting for the original MA plan to re -open. If the MA Organization uses option #2 above - it must notify the individual in writing that he or she has been placed on a waiting list. The notice must inform the individual that the en rollment request will not be processed until the plan re -opens for enrollment, must include the date the plan will re - open, and must inform the individual that he or she may cancel the request for enrollment before the plan re -opens. All individuals who wi sh to wait for an opening must be placed on the waiting list. After the MA plan re -opens, if the plan was closed for more than 30 calendar days since the MA organization received the enrollment request, it must contact (orally or in writing) the individua l to re - affirm the individual's intent to enroll before processing the enrollment. (The MA organization may make this contact even if the plan was closed for less than 30 days.) The MA organization must send written notice of intent to not process the enrollment to all individuals who state they are no longer interested in being enrolled in the MA plan, and should do so within ten calendar days after contacting the individual. For individuals who indicate their continued interest in enrollment, the MA orga nization must document the individual's expressed interest to continue enrollment. This may be done via phone contact report, notation on the enrollment form, etc. The date the MA plan re -opened becomes the \"receipt date\" of enrollment forms received when the plan was closed. EXAMPLE: If the plan was closed in February and re -opens on March 1, then the receipt date of enrollment requests received in February is March 1. 40.6 - Enrollments Not Legally Valid When an enrollment is not legally valid, a retroactive cancellation of enrollment action may be necessary (refer to \u00a760.5 for more information on retroactive disenrollments). In addition, a reinstatement to the plan in which the individual was originally enrolled may be necessary if the invalid enrollme nt resulted in an individual's disenrollment from his/her original plan of choice. An enrollment that is not complete, as defined in \u00a710, is not legally valid. In addition, an enrollment is not legally valid if it is later determine d that the individual did not meet eligibility requirements at the time of enrollment. For example, an enrollment is not legally valid if an MA organization determines at a later date that the individual provided an incorrect permanent address at the time of enrollment and the actual address is outside the MA plan's service area. A second example could be an instance 96 where an individual not authorized by State law to make an enrollment request on another's behalf attempts to complete an enrollment request. There are also instances in which an enrollment that appears to be complete can turn out to be legally invalid. In particular, CMS does not regard an enrollment as actually complete if the member or his/her legal representative did not intend to enroll i n the MA organization. If there is evidence that the individual did not intend to enroll in the MA organization, the MA organization should submit a retroactive disenrollment request to CMS. Evidence of lack of intent to enroll by the individual may includ e: An enrollment request signed by the individual when a legal representative should have signed for the individual; Request by the individual for cancellation of enrollment before the effective date (refer to \u00a760.2 for procedures for processing cancellations); Enrolling in a supplemental insurance program immediately after enrolling in the MA organization; or Receiving non -emergency or non -urgent services out -of-plan immediately after the effective date of coverage under the plan. Payment of the premium does not necessarily indicate an informed decision to enroll. For example, the individual may believe that he/she was purchasing a supplemental health insurance policy, as opposed to enrolling in an MA organization. In addition, use of an MA plan doctor does not necessarily indicate an understanding of the lock-in requirement if the doctor also treats non-plan members. 40.7 - Enrollment Procedures for Medicare MSA Plans MA organizations offering a Medicare MSA plan must follow the procedures outl ined in \u00a7\u00a740.2, 40.3, 40.4, 40.5.1, and 40.6. MSA plans must have a paper enrollment form available for eligible individuals to request enrollment. Exhibit 1b is a model MSA plan enrollment form. Organizations may use this model form as it appears or may c ustomize their enrollment forms based on this model, if they follow usual Medicare marketing material approval practices and ensure all the required MSA specific elements are included. Applications for Medicare MSAs must include a question regarding electi on of the Medicare hospice benefit. All information necessary to successfully enroll the individual in the MSA plan must be provided to consider the enrollment request complete, including the answers to questions 1 - 4 on the model MSA enrollment form. Ad ditionally, the organization must obtain the necessary banking and account information before the enrollment can be considered complete. The MA organization must ensure its materials describing the MSA plan explain the details of having the MSA account and what options the individual will have regarding the account. Beneficiaries may enroll into a Medicare MSA plan only through the MA organization offering that plan. Beneficiaries may enroll directly with the plan by completing an approved paper enrollment form. Additionally, MSA plans may offer an online enrollment mechanism as defined in \u00a740.1.2 through the organization's website. MSA plans are not available through the Online Enrollment Center on the Medicare.gov website. 97 40.7.1 - Establishing the MS A Banking Account during the Enrollment Process Medicare beneficiaries interested in enrolling in a MSA plan will need to establish an MSA bank account to accept MSA deposits in accordance with the MSA plan's procedures. The MA Organization must have docu mentation that a beneficiary will open the MSA account before submitting an enrollment transaction to MARx for that beneficiary. CMS will make the annual deposit payment to the plan on the same schedule as the monthly capitation payment. Per Section 1853(e )(2) of the Act, payment of an MSA deposit cannot be made until the beneficiary account has been established. Acceptable documentation that an MSA account has been established includes a written/electronic notice from the bank that the beneficiary has opened an MSA account, or a written/electronic communication from the beneficiary that the MSA account has been opened, with the bank routing number and account number reported on the communication. The MSA organization must retain this documentation. Describ ed below are several procedures that the MSA Organization could implement to facilitate the establishment of these MSA accounts: 1. The organization provides the beneficiary with specific banking enrollment materials to begin the process necessary for establishment of the MSA banking account. The specified bank supplies the beneficiary with the required signature card and items needed for establishing the account. The beneficiary completes and returns the required documents to the specified bank. The ba nk provides the information to the MSA plan to complete the enrollment transaction. 2. For an employer/union sponsored MSA plan, the plan's designated bank deals directly with the employer or union allowing the employer or union to facilitate the establishme nt of an account on behalf of the Medicare beneficiaries enrolling in the MSA plan. Finally, these procedures must accommodate the following guidance: MSA organizations must educate beneficiaries that the enrollment is not complete until the MSA account is set up. The organization must have documentation that the account has been established prior to submitting the enrollment transaction to CMS. MSA organizations must educate beneficiaries that once the enrollee's initial deposit has been received in the MSA account the enrollee may then transfer the funds to his or her own banking institution. MARx will not reject an MSA enrollment transaction if CMS records show an open period of Medicaid or Hospice coverage; however, MARx will provide information about these statuses. MSA plans should contact the beneficiary to confirm or deny this information. 98 50 - Disenrollment Procedures 42 CFR 422.74 Except as provided for in this section, an MA organization may not, either orally or in writing, or by any action or inaction, request or encourage any member to disenroll. While an MA organization may contact members to determine the reason for disenrollment, the MA organization must not discourage members from disenrolling after they indicate their desire to do so. The MA organization must apply disenrollment policies in a consistent manner for similar members in similar circumstances. All notice requirements are summarized in Appendix 1. NOTE: It is not necessary for an MA plan to send a notice of disenrollment to beneficiaries whose plan benefit package (PBP) number is changed as part of a CMS -approved plan renewal. The annual notice of change that the MA organization sends to the benefi ciaries as part of the end -of-year activities serves this function. Instructions and information on the annual notice of change can be found in\u00a760.7 of Chapter 3 of the Medicare Managed Care Manual. 50.1 - Voluntary Disenrollment by Member A member may r equest disenrollment from an MA plan only during one of the election periods outlined in \u00a7\u00a730 and 30.7. The member may disenroll by: 1. Enrolling in another plan (during a valid enrollment period); 2. Giving or faxing a signed written notice to the MA organization , or through his/her employer or union, where applicable ; 3. Submitting a request via the Internet to the MA organization (if the MA organization offers such an option); or 4. Calling 1 -800-MEDICARE. If a memb er verbally requests disenrollment from the MA plan, the MA organization must instruct the member to make the request in one of the ways described above. The MA organization may send a disenrollment form to the member upon request (see Exhibits 9, 9a, and 10). The disenrollment request must be dated when it is initially received by the MA organization. Per \u00a740.2.1, when someone other than the Medicare beneficiary completes a disenrollment request, he or she must: 1. Attest that he or she has the authority u nder State law to make the disenrollment request on behalf of the individual; 2. Attest that proof of this authorization (if any), as required by State law that empowers the individual to effect a disenrollment request on behalf of the applicant is available upon request by the MA organization or CMS; and 3. Provide contact information. 99 50.1.1 - Requests Submitted via Internet The MA organization has the option to allow members to submit disenrollment requests via the Internet; however, certain conditions must be met. The MA organization must, at a minimum, comply with the CMS security policies - found at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/informationsecurity/. However, the MA organization may also include additional security provisions. The CMS policies indicate that with regard to receiving such disenrollments via the Internet, an acceptable method of encryption must be utilized to provide for confidentiality and integrity of this data, and that authentication or identification procedures are employed to assure that both t he sender and recipient of the data are known to each other and are authorized to receive and decrypt such information. In addition, CMS policies require MA organizations to provide the CMS Office of Information Services with a pro forma notice of intent to use the Internet for these purposes. The notice is essentially an attestation that the MA organization is complying with the required encryption, authentication, and identification requirements. The CMS reserves the right to audit the MA organization to ascertain whether it is in compliance with the security policy. The effective date of the request is determined by the election period in which the valid request was received by the MA organization. The election period is determined by the date the reque st is received at the site designated by the MA organization, as described in member materials. The option of online disenrollment is limited to requests submitted via the MA organization's website. Online disenrollment via other means, such as a broker w ebsite, as well as disenrollment requests submitted via email, are not permitted. 50.1.2 - Request Signature and Date When providing a written request, the individual must sign the disenrollment request. If the individual is unable to sign, a legal repr esentative must sign the request (refer to \u00a740.2.1 for more detail on who may complete enrollment and disenrollment request s). If a legal representative signs the request for the individual, then he or she must attest to having the authority under State la w to do so, and confirm that a copy of the proof of court -appointed legal guardian, durable power of attorney, or proof of other authorization required by State law that empowers the individual to effect a disenrollment request on behalf of the applicant i s available and can be presented upon request to the MA organization or CMS. The individual and/or legal representative should write the date he/she signed the disenrollment request; however, if he/she inadvertently fails to include the date, then the dat e of receipt that the MA organization places on the request form will serve as the signature date. If a written disenrollment request is received and the signature is not included, the MA organization may verify with the individual or legal representative with a phone call and document the contact, rather than return the written request as incomplete. 100 50.1.3 - Effective Date of Disenrollment The election period during which the organization received a valid request to disenroll will determine the effective date of the disenrollment; refer to \u00a7\u00a730.6 and 30.7 for information regarding disenrollment effective dates. With the exception of some SEPs and when election periods overlap, beneficiaries may not choose their effective date. Instead, the MA or ganization is responsible for assigning the appropriate effective date based on the election period. During face -to-face disenrollments, or when a beneficiary calls about a disenrollment, the MA organization staff are responsible for ensuring that a benefi ciary does not choose an effective date that is not allowed under the requirements outlined in \u00a7\u00a730.6 and 30.7. If a beneficiary submits a disenrollment request with an unallowable effective date, or if the MA organization allowed the beneficiary to choose an unallowable effective date, the MA organization must call or write the beneficiary to explain that the disenrollment must be processed with a different effective date. The organization should resolve the issue with the beneficiary as to the corre ct effective date, and the call must be documented. If the beneficiary refuses to have the disenrollment processed with the correct effective date, the beneficiary can cancel the disenrollment request according to the procedures outlined in \u00a760.2.2. 50.1. 4 - Notice Requirements After the member submits a request, the MA organization must provide the member with a disenrollment notice within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request to disenroll. The disenrollment notice must include an explanation of the lock -in restrictions for the period during which the member remains enrolled in the organization, and the effective date of the disenrollment (see Exhibit 11). The MA organization may also advise the disenrolling member to hold Original Medicare cla ims for up to one month so that Medicare computer records can be updated to show that the person is no longer enrolled in the plan. For these types of disenrollments, i.e., disenrollments in which the member has disenrolled directly through the MA organiza tion, MA organizations are encouraged, but not required, to follow up with a confirmation of disenrollment notice after receiving CMS confirmation of the disenrollment from the DTRR. Since Medicare beneficiaries have the option of disenrolling through sou rces other than the MA organization (such as 1 -800-MEDICARE or by enrolling in another Medicare managed care plan or PDP), the MA organization will not always receive a request for disenrollment directly from the member and will instead learn of the disenr ollment through the CMS D TRR. If the MA organization learns of the voluntary disenrollment from the CMS DTRR (as opposed to through written request from the member), the MA organization must send a written confirmation notice of the disenrollment to the me mber within ten calendar days of the availability of the DTRR (see Exhibit 12). Organizations may choose, but are not required, to issue a disenrollment confirmation notice for an automatic disenrollments resulting from an individual's enrollment in a PBP within the same MA contract. If the MA organization receives a disenrollment request that it must deny, the organization must notify the enrollee within 10 calendar days of the receipt of the request, and must include the reason for the denial (see Exhibi t 12a). 101 An MA organization may deny a voluntary request for disenrollment only when: 1. The request was made outside of an allowable period as described in \u00a730 of this guidance; or 2. The request was made by someone other than the enrollee and that individual is not the enrollee's legal representative (as described in \u00a740.2.1). 3. The request was incomplete and the required information is not provided within the required time frame (as described in \u00a750.4.2) . 50.1.5 - Optional Employer/Union MA Disenrollment Reque st Mechanism As described in \u00a720.4.1 of this chapter, beginning April 1, 2003, MA organizations that offer employer or union group -sponsored MA plans may choose to accept voluntary disenrollment requests from beneficiaries enrolled in those plans directly from the employer or union (or its TPA) without obtaining a written disenrollment request from each individual. The disenrollment must be prospective from the date the request is received by the employer/union group. The MA organization must inform its Regional Office Account Manager of its intent to use this mechanism and identify the employer(s) or union(s) for which it will be accepting disenrollments made in this manner. The disenrollment information (i.e., the electronic file) submitted to the MA organization by the employer or union (or TPA) must accurately reflect the employer's or union's record of the disenrollment made by each individual according to the processes the employer or union has in place, and may be accepted without a paper MA disenrollment request form. This alternate dis enrollment request mechanism is used in place of paper MA disenrollment request forms and does not require a signature. For purposes o f compatibility with existing instructions in this chapter, the MA organization receipt date will be the date the employer's or union's record of an individual's disenrollment choice is received by the MA organization. MA organizations must record these da tes. Effective date calculation of voluntary disenrollments and the collection and submission of disenrollments to CMS will follow existing procedures. To accept electronic records of employer or union disenrollment requests, the MA organization must, at minimum, comply with the CMS security policies regarding the acceptable method of encryption utilized to provide for data security, confidentiality and integrity, and authentication and identification procedures to ensure both the sender and recipient o f the data are known to each other and are authorized to receive and decrypt the information. The employer's or union's record of the dis enrollment request must exist in a format that can be easily, accurately and quickly reproduced for later reference by each individual member, the MA organization and/or CMS as necessary, and be maintained (by the employer/union or the MA organization, as they agree) for at least 6 years following the effective date of the individual's disenrollment from an MA plan. Th e MA organization must maintain its record of information received from the employer or union following the guidelines for MA disenrollment request forms (see \u00a760.9). 102 50.1.6 - Group Disenrollment for Employer/Union Sponsored Plans CMS is providing a proc ess for group disenrollment from an employer or union sponsored MA plan. CMS will allow an employer or union to disenroll its retirees from an employer or union sponsored MA plan using a group disenrollment process. The group disenrollment process must in clude notification to each beneficiary as follows: All beneficiaries must be notified that the employer or union intends to disenroll them from the MA plan that the employer or union is offering; and This notice must be provided by the MA organization, employer, or union not less than 21 calendar days prior to the effective date of the beneficiary's disenrollment from the employer/union sponsored MA plan. Additionally, the information provided must include an explanation on how to contact Medicare for information about other MA plan options that might be available to the beneficiaries. The employer/union must have and provide all the information required for the MA organization to submit a complete disenrollment request transaction to CMS, as described in this and other CMS MA systems guidance. Records must be maintained as outlined in \u00a760.9 of this chapter. 50.1.7 - Medigap Guaranteed Issue Notification Requirements for Disenrollments to Original Medicare during a SEP MA organizations are required to notify members of their Medigap guaranteed issue rights when members disenroll from the MA plan and into Original Medicare during a SEP. Model language discussing these Medigap rights has been provided in Exhibit 11 and Exhibit 12. There may be cases when a Medigap issuer requires the beneficiary to provide additional documentation that s/he disenrolled as a result of an SEP and is eligible for such guaranteed issue rights. A beneficiary may contact the MA organization for assistance in providing such docu mentation. The MA organization may provide such a notice to the beneficiary upon request (see Exhibit 24). 50.2 - Required Involuntary Disenrollment The MA organization must disenroll a member from an MA plan in the following cases. Refer to \u00a750.6 for some exceptions to required disenrollment for grandfathered members. 1. A change in residence (includes incarceration - see below) makes the individual ineligible to remain enrolled in the plan (\u00a750.2.1); 2. The member loses entitlement to either Medica re Part A or Part B (\u00a750.2.2); 3. The SNP enrollee loses special needs status and does not reestablish SNP eligibility prior to the expiration of the period of deemed continued eligibility (\u00a720.11). 4. The member dies (\u00a750.2.3); 103 5. The MA organization contract is terminated, or the MA organization reduces its service area to exclude the member. There is an exception to this rule, which is described in \u00a750.2.4; 6. The member fails to pay his or her Part D -IRMAA to the government and CMS notifies the plan to effectuate the disenrollment (\u00a750.2.6 ); or 7. The member is not lawfully present in the United States (\u00a750.2. 7). Incarceration - A member who is incarcerated resides outside the plan's service area, even if the correctional facility is located within the plan's service area (see \u00a710 for definition of \"incarcerated\"). Notice Requirements - Disenrollment notices must be sent when: The individual has a change in residence and is determined to be out of the plan's service area; CMS disenrolls the individual due to incarceration; The individual loses SNP status and doesn't regain eligibility within the period of continued deemed eligibility; The individual loses eligibility for enrollment due to contract termination or service area reduction by the MA organization; or CMS disenrolls the individual for non -payment of Part D -IRMAA . For disenrollments effectuated by the MA organization, all disenrollment notices must: 1. Advise the member that the M A organization is planning to disenroll the member and why such action is occurring; 2. Be mailed to the member before submission of the disenrollment transaction to CMS; and 3. Include an explanation of the member's right to a hearing under the MA org anization's grievance procedures. (This explanation is not required if the disenrollment is a result of the MA plan termination or service area or continuation area reduction, since a hearing would not be appropriate for that type of disenrollment. There a re different notice requirements for terminations and service area reductions, which are provided in separate instructions to MA organizations.) For disenrollments effectuated by CMS due to incarceration or nonpayment of Part D -IRMAA , the disenrollment notice must a dvise the member that th e plan has disenrolled him or her, why such action is occurring and be mailed within ten (10) calendar days of receiving the disenrollment DTRR from CMS. Plans are strongly encouraged, but not required, to send notices for certain CMS -effectuated disenrollments, including: Death (Exhibit 13); Loss of entitlement (Exhibit 14); and Unlawful presence in the United States (Exhibit 38). 104 For plans that provide d isenrollment notices for these situations, the disenrollment notices should advise the member that the plan has disenrolled him or her and why such action is occurring. Plans are encouraged to mail these notices within ten (10) calendar days of receiving the disenrollment D TRR from CMS. Medigap Guaranteed Issue Notification Requirements for Disenrollments to Original Medicare during a SEP MA organizations are required t o notify members of their Medigap guaranteed issue rights when members disenroll to Original Medicare during a SEP. Model language discussing these Medigap rights has been provided in Exhibit 11 and Exhibit 12. There may be cases when a Medigap issuer req uires the beneficiary to provide additional documentation that they disenrolled as a result of an SEP and are eligible for such guaranteed issue rights. A beneficiary may contact you for assistance in providing such documentation. The MA organization may provide such a notice to the beneficiary upon request (see Exhibit 24). 50.2.1 - Members Who Change Residence MA organizations may offer (or continue to offer) extended \"visitor\" or \"traveler\" programs to members of coordinated care plans who have been ou t of the service area for up to 12 months. The MA organizations that offer such programs do not have to disenroll members in these extended programs who remain out of the service area for more than 6 months but less than 12 months. As mentioned at 42 CFR 422.74(d)(4)(iii), MA organizations offering a plan with a visitor/traveler program must make this option available to all enrollees who are absent for an extended period from the MA plan's service area. However, MA organizations may limit this option to enrollees who travel to certain areas, as defined by the MA organization, and who receive services from qualified providers. Organizations offering MA -PFFS plans may allow continued enrollment of individuals absent from the plan service area for up to 12 m onths, given that PFFS plans provide access to plan benefits and services from providers located outside the plan service area. MA organizations offering plans without these programs must disenroll members who have been out of the service area for more t han 6 months. An SEP, as defined in \u00a730.4.1, applies to individuals who are disenrolled due to a change in residence. An individual may choose another MA or Part D plan (either a PDP or MA -PD) during this SEP. 50.2.1.1 - General Rule The MA organization must disenroll a member if: 1. He/she permanently moves out of the service area and his/her new residence is not in a continuation area; 2. The member's temporary absence from the service area (or continuation area, for continuation of enrollment me mbers) exceeds 6 consecutive months; 105 3. The member is enrolled in an MA plan that offers a visitor/traveler program and his/her temporary absence exceeds 12 consecutive months (or the length of the visitor/traveler program if less than 12 months); 4. The member is an out -of-area member (as defined in \u00a710), and permanently moves to an area that is not in the service area or continuation area; 5. He/she permanently moves out of the continuation area of an MA local plan and his/her new residence is no t in the service area or another continuation area of the MA local plan; 6. The member permanently moves out of the service area (or continuation area, for continuation of enrollment members in MA local plans) and into a continuation area, but chooses n ot to continue enrollment in the MA local plan (refer to \u00a760.7 for procedures for choosing the continuation of enrollment option); 7. The member is an out -of-area member (as defined in \u00a710), who leaves his/her residence for more than 6 months; 8. The member is incarcerated and, therefore, resides out of area for the duration of the incarceration . 50.2.1.2 - Effective Date of Disenrollment Generally disenrollments for reasons 1 , 4, 5, 6 and 8 above are effective the first day of the calendar month after the date the member begins residing outside of the MA plan's service area (or continuation area, as appropriate) AND after the member or his or her legal representative notifies the organization that he or she has moved and no longer resides in the plan service area. In the case of an individual who provides advance notice of the move, the disenrollment will be the first of the month following the month in which the individual indicates he or she will be moving. In the case of incarcerated individuals, CMS will involuntarily disenroll individuals who are incarcerated based on data CMS receives from SSA . CMS will report the disenrollments to the organization via the daily DTRR using a specific Transaction Reply Code (TRC). For all such disenrollments, the effective date of disenrollment will be the first of the month after the incarceration start date. MA organizations may receive notification of the individual's possible incarceration status via another source. In this situation , the MA organization needs to investigate and, following processes in \u00a750.2.1.3, determine if the member resides in the plan's service area and, if appropriate, involuntarily disenroll the member . If the incarceration information is received from a public entity or other source with direct access to confirmed incarceration data, such as a penal facility, state Medicaid agency or other state or federal agency, additional investigation is not necessary. Disenrollment is effective the first of the month follow ing the organization' s confirmation of a current incarceration. The MA organization is required to send notification of the disenrollment to the member. If the member establishes that a permanent move occurred retroactively and requests retroactiv e disen rollment (not earlier than the first of the month after the move), the MA organization can submit this request to CMS (or its designee) for consideration of retroactive action. 106 Disenrollment for reasons 2 and 7 above is effective the first day of the calendar month after 6 months have passed. Disenrollment for reason 3 is effective the 1st day of the 13th month (or the length of the visitor/traveler program if less than 12 months) after the individual left the service area. Unless the member elects another Medicare managed care plan during an applicable election period , any disenrollment processed under these provisions will result in a change to enrollment in Original Medicare. 50.2.1.3 - Researching and Acting on a Change of Address Within ten (10) calendar days of receiving a notice of a change of address or an ind ication of possible out-of-area residency from the member, the member's legal representative, a CMS D TRR, or another source, the MA organization must make an attempt to contact the member to confirm whether the move is permanent (may use Exhibit 34 if cont acting the member in writing). The MA organization must also document its efforts. The requirement to attempt to contact the member does not apply to a prospective enrollment for which the organization receives either transaction reply code 011 (Enrollment Accepted) or 100 (PBP Change Accepted as Submitted) accompanied by 016 (Enrollment Accepted - Out of Area) on the same DTRR, as these represent new enrollments for which the organization recently confirmed the individ ual's permanent residence in the plan service area. MA organizations may obtain either written or verbal verification of changes in address, as long as the MA organization applies the policy consistently among all members. In the case of individuals fo r which the plan learns of possible incarceration status from a source other than CMS, the MA organization must confirm the individual's out of area (i.e., incarcerated) status. Confirmation may include contacting the individual or other sources to determi ne confirmation of incarceration and incarceration start and end dates, if applicable. As described in \u00a750.2.1.2, additional investigation is not necessary if the incarceration information is received from a public entity or other source with direct acces s to confirmed incarceration data. When an organi zation is notified of a current member 's past period of incarceration and has confirmed that this member 's period of incarceration has ended (i.e. individual is no longer incarcerated), the organization must continue the individual' s enrollment, unless otherwise directed by CMS. If the MA organization confirms an individual's current incarceration status but does not obtain the start date of the current incarceration, the organization must disenroll the individual prospectively for the first of the month following the date on which the current incarceration was confirmed. If the MA organization confirms an individual's current incarceration status as well as the start date of the current incarceration, t he organization must disenroll the individual for the first of the month following the start date of the incarceration. If that disenrollment effective date is outside the range of effective dates allowed by MARx (based on the current calendar month), the MA organization must submit the retroactive disenrollment request to the CMS Retroactive Processing Contractor (see \u00a760.5). The MA organization must retain documentation from the member or member's legal representative of the notice of the change in addr ess, including the determination of whether the member's out -of-area status is temporary or permanent. 1. If the MA organization receives notice of a permanent change in address from the member or the member's legal representative , and the new address is outside the MA plan's service 107 area (or continuation area, for continuation of enrollment members), the MA organization must disenroll the member and provide proper notification (Exhibit 36). The only exception is if the member has permanently moved into th e continuation area and chosen the continuation of enrollment option (procedures for electing a continuation of enrollment option are outlined in \u00a760.8). 2. If the MA organization receives notice (or indication) of a potential change in address from a source other than the member or the member's legal representative , and the new address is outside the MA plan's service area (or continuation area, for continuation of enrollment members), the MA organization may not assume the move is permanent until it has received confirmation from the member, the member's legal representative or, for incarcerated individuals, public sources (such as a state/federal government entity or other public records). The MA organization must initiate disenrollment when it verifi es a move is permanent or when the member has been out of the service area (or continuation area, for continuation of enrollment members) for six months from the date the MA organization lea rned of the change in address. The MA organization must notify the member in writing of the disenrollment. If the member responded and confirmed the permanent move out of the service area, the MA organization must send the notice (Exhibit 36) within 10 calendar days of the member's confirmati on that the move is permanent . If the member failed to respond to the request for address confirmation the MA organization must send the notice (Exhibit 35) in the first ten days of the sixth month from the date the MA organization learned of the change in address. MA organizations may consider the six months to have begun on the date given by the beneficiary as the date that he/she will be leaving the service area. If the beneficiary did not inform the MA organization of when he/she left the service area, the MA org anization can consider the six months to have begun on the date it received information regarding the member's potential change in address (e.g. D TRR, out -of-area claims). If the member does not respond to the request for verification within the time fram e given by the MA organization, the MA organization cannot assume the move is permanent and may not disenroll the member until six months have passed. The MA organization may continue its attempts to verify address information with the member. 3. Tempor ary absences - If the MA organization determines the change in address is temporary, the MA organization may not initiate disenrollment until six months have passed from the date the MA organization received information regarding the member's absence from the service area (or from the date the member states that his/her address changed, if that date is earlier). If the MA organization offers a visitor/traveler program, the MA organization must initiate disenrollment if it learns that the individual continu es to remain out of the service area during the 12 months (or the length of its visitor/traveler program if less than 12 months). 50.2.1.4 - Procedures for Developing Addresses for Members Whose Mail is Returned as Undeliverable If an address is not current, the USPS will return any materials mailed first -class by the organization as undeliverable. 108 In the event that any member materials are returned as undeliverable, the organization must take the following steps: 1. If the USPS returns mail with a new forwarding address, forward plan materials to the beneficiary and advise the plan member to change his or her address with the Social Security Administration . 2. If the organization receives documented proof of a beneficiary change th at is outside of the plan service area or mail is returned without a forwarding address, follow the procedures described in \u00a750.2.1.3. 3. If the organization receives claims for services from providers located outside the plan service area, the organization m ay choose to follow up with the provider to obtain the member's address. 4. If the organization is successful in locating the beneficiary, advise the beneficiary to update records with the Social Security Administration by: a. Calling their toll -free number, 1 -800-772-1213. TTY users should call 1 -800-325-0778 weekdays from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. EST; b. Going to http://www.ssa.gov/changeaddress.html on the SSA website; or c. Notifying the local SSA field office. A beneficiary can g et addresses and directions to SSA field offices from the Social Security Office Locator which is available on the Internet at : http://www.socialsecurity .gov/locator/ . An organization is expected to continue to mail materials to the member's address of record. If the postal service returns a piece of beneficiary communication to the organization, the plan should document the return and retain the returned material . It should continue to send future correspondence to that same address , as a forwarding address may become available at a later date . Additionally, CMS encourages the MA organization to continue its efforts, as discussed above, to attempt to locate the beneficiary using any available resources, including CMS systems, to ident ify new address information for the beneficiary . If a forwarding address become s available, an organization can send materials to that address as in item #1 above . 50.2.1.5 - Notice Requirements 1. MA organization notified of out -of-area permanent move - When the organization receives notice of a permanent change in address from the member or the member's legal representative, it must provide notification of disenrollment to the member. This notic e to the member, as well as the disenrollment transaction to CMS, must be sent within ten (10) calendar days of the MA organization's learning of the permanent move. In the notice, the MA organization is encouraged to inform the member who moves out of th e service area that he or she may have certain Medigap enrollment opportunities available to them. These opportunities end 63 days after coverage with the MA organization ends. The MA organization can direct the beneficiary to contact the State Health Insu rance Assistance Program (SHIP) for additional information on Medigap insurance. 109 In the case of incarcerated individuals disenrolled by CMS, we will report the disenrollments to the organization via the daily DTRR using a specific TRC. An MA organization must send each affected individual a written notice of the disenrollment within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the D TRR indicating disenrollment due to incarceration. 2. Out of area for 6 months - When the member has been out of the service area fo r 6 months after the date the MA organization learned of the change in address from a source other than the member or the member's legal representative (or the date the member stated that his address changed, if that date is earlier), the MA organization m ust provide notification of the upcoming disenrollment to the member. Organizations are encouraged to follow up with members and to issue interim notices prior to the expiration of the 6 month period. The notice of disenrollment must be provided within the first ten calendar days of the sixth month. The transaction to CMS must be sent within three ( 3) business days following the disenrollment effective date. This notice must also be provided to out -of-area members (as defined in \u00a7 10) who leave their residence and that absence exceeds six (6) months. The CMS strongly encourages that MA organizations send a final confirmation of disenrollment notice to the member to ensure the individual does not continue to use MA organization serv ices. EXAMPLE : MA organization receives a D TRR on January 20 indicating an \"out of area\" State and County Code. The 6 -month period ends on July 20. The MA organization sends a notice to the member within ten ( 10) calendar days of receipt of the D TRR an d does not receive any response from the member indicating this information is incorrect. Therefore, the MA organization will proceed with the disenrollment, effective August 1. The MA organization sends a notice to the member during the first ten ( 10) calendar days of July notifying him that he will be disenrolled effective August 1. The transaction to CMS must be sent no later than three ( 3) business days following July 31. 3. Visitor/Traveler Program Option - When the member has been out of the se rvice area for 12 months (or the length of its visitor/traveler program if less than 12 months), the MA organization must provide notification of the upcoming disenrollment to the member. The notice of disenrollment must be provided during the first ten calendar days of the 12th month (or the length of its visitor/traveler program). The transaction to CMS must be sent within 3 business days following the disenrollment effective date. The CMS strongly encourages that MA organizations send a final confirma tion of disenrollment notice to the member to ensure the individual does not continue to use MA organization services. 50.2.2 - Loss of Medicare Part A or Part B With the exception of Medicare Part B -only grandfathered members (as described in \u00a7\u00a720.6 and 50.6), the MA organization cannot retain a member in an MA plan if the member is no longer entitled to both 110 Medicare Part A and Part B benefits. The organization will be notified by CMS that entitlement to either Medicare Part A or Part B has ended, and C MS will make the disenrollment effective the first day of the month following the last month of entitlement to either Medicare Part A or Part B benefits (whichever occurred first). If a member loses entitlement to Medicare Part A, the MA organization may not allow the member to remain a member of the plan and receive Medicare Part B -only services. In addition, the MA organization may not offer Part A -equivalent benefits and charge a premium for such coverage to members who lose entitlement to Medicare Part A. Likewise, if a member loses entitlement to Medicare Part B at any time, the MA organization may not allow the member to remain in the MA plan. Notice Requirements - CMS strongly suggests that notices be provided when the disenrollment is due to the lo ss of entitlement to either Medicare Part A or Part B (see Exhibit 14) so that any erroneous disenrollments can be corrected as soon as possible. In cases of erroneous disenrollment and notification, see \u00a760.3.1. 50.2.3 - Death The CMS will disenroll a member from an MA organization upon his/her death and CMS will notify the MA organization that the member has died. This disenrollment is effective the first day of the calendar month following the month of death. Organizations may not submit disenrollment transactions to CMS in response to the apparent death of a member. If the eligibility query shows a date of death, the MA organization must submit the enrollment only when the date of death is equal to or greater than the effective date. In anticipation of official notification from CMS via the D TRR, organizations may, at their discretion, make note of the reported death in internal plan systems in order to suppress premium bills and member notices. Notice Requirements - Following receipt of a CMS notifi cation (via D TRR) of disenrollment due to death, CMS strongly suggests that a notice be sent to the member or the estate of the member (see Exhibit 13) so that any erroneous disenrollments can be corrected as soon as possible. In cases of erroneous disenrollment and notification, see \u00a760.3.1. 50.2.4 - Terminations/Nonrenewals The MA organization must disenroll a member from an MA plan if the MA organization contract is terminated or if the MA organization discontinues offeri ng the plan or reduces its service area to exclude the member. A member who is disenrolled under these provisions has an SEP, as described in \u00a730.4.3, to elect a different MA plan or Original Medicare. A member who fails to make an enrollment request duri ng this SEP is deemed to have elected Original Medicare. EXCEPTION MA organizations can offer an option to continue enrollment in an MA local plan in the organization to members affected by MA plan service area reductions in areas where no other MA plans are 111 available at that time. If the organization chooses to offer this option, it must notify CMS, and must notify members in the beneficiary non- renewal notification letter. Members must indicate their desire to take advantage of this option. Members who take this option to continue enrollment become known as \"out -of-area members,\" as defined in \u00a710. The organization may require individuals who choose to continue enrollment in an MA local plan in the organization to agree to receive the full range of basic benefits (excluding emergency and urgently needed care, renal dialysis, and post stabilization) exclusively at facilities designated by the MA organization within the MA local plan service area. Notice Requirements - The MA organization must give each Medicare member a written notice of the effective date of the termination or service area or continuation area reduction, and include a description of alternatives for obtaining benefits under the Medicare program. Requi red time frames for these notices are outlined in 42 CFR 422.506 - 422.512. 50.2.5 - Loss of Special Needs Status A SNP can determine to continue to provide care for an individual that no longer meets the unique eligibility criteria of the plan (i.e., special needs status) , if the individual can reasonably be expected to again meet the special needs criteria within a period of time not to exceed six (6) months . For example, a dual eligible individual who loses Medicaid eligibility can be deemed to conti nue to be eligible for the plan if that individual would likely regain eligibility within six months . The SNP may choose any length of time from one month to six months for deeming continued eligibility , as long as it applies the criteria consistently to all members of the plan and fully informs members of its policy. CMS expects the plan to take into account the ability to meet the needs of an individual that no longer meets special needs status if and when applying the period of deemed continued eligibi lity. If the member of a SNP does not re -qualify within the plan's period of deemed continued eligibility, the SNP should involuntarily disenroll him or her , with proper notice, at the end of this period. The period of deemed continued eligibility begins the first of the month following the month in which information regarding the loss is available to the organization and communicated to the enrollee, including cases of retroactive Medicaid terminations . For information on premiums, benefits and cost shar ing during the period of deemed continued eligibility, see Chapter 16b of the Medicare Managed Care Manual. If the SNP is unable to provide continuity of care to a member who loses eligibility, the organization is expected to involuntarily disenroll the member. For example, when a member of an institutional SNP leaves the long -term care facility, he or she should be disenrolled from that SNP if the SNP providers are limited to those within the facility. Regardless of the dat e on which the beneficiary loses special needs status, the organization must provide him/her with a minimum of 30 days advance notice of disenrollment. Refer to Chapter s 1 and 16b of the Medicare Managed Care Manual for additional information on Special Needs Plans. Notice Requirements - The SNP is expected to provide each member a written notice regarding the loss of special needs status within 10 calendar days of learning of the loss of special needs status. This 112 notice should provide the member an op portunity to prove that he or she is still eligible to be in the plan. In addition, the notice should include information regarding the period of deemed continued eligibility, including its duration, a complete description of the SEP for which such individuals are eligible (see \u00a730.4.4, item #10), the consequences of not regaining special needs status within the period of deemed continued eligibility and the effective disenrollment date (see Exhibit 32). Organizations are encouraged to follow up with member s and to issue interim notices prior to the expiration of the period of deemed continued eligibility. In the event the individual fails to regain special needs status during the period of deemed continued eligibility, the SNP is expected to provide the individual a written notice regarding involuntary disenrollment (see Exhibit 33) and must submit a disenrollment transaction to CMS. The disenrollment notice to the individual and the transaction to CMS should be sent within 3 business days following the l ast day of the period of deemed continued eligibility ; however, in no case should the disenrollment notice to the individual be sent after the transaction is submitted to CMS . In the event the SNP fails to process disenrollments timely, the organization is expected to take the following action(s): a. If the SNP has not provided timely notification to the member of the potential for involuntary disenrollment due to loss of special needs status (see Exhibit 32), the SNP should provide this notice to the membe r and include a proposed disenrollment date that provides the member the full length of the period of deemed continued eligibility. The SNP may not shorten the grace period due its delay in issuing the notice. b. If the SNP has not provided timely notificati on to the member of the involuntary disenrollment due to loss of special needs status (see Exhibit 33), the SNP should provide this notice to the member, revise the disenrollment date accordingly and include an explanation of the delay and of the revised disenrollment date. 50.2.6 - Failure to Pay a Part D -Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (Part D -IRMAA) Individuals with Part D -IRMAA must pay this additional premium directly to the government, not to their plans. CMS has established a 3 -month initial grace period before individuals in an MA plan with Part D coverage (MA -PD) who fail to pay their assessed Part D -IRMAA will be di senrolled from the MA-PD plan. CMS will report the disenrollment s to the organization via the daily DTRR using a specific T ransaction Reply Code (TRC) . The effective date of the disenrollment is the first of the month following the end of the initial grace period. EXAMPLE: Ms. Jones owes a Part D -IRMAA. CMS bills Ms. Jones her monthly Part D -IRMAA amount in March , April and May. Ms. Jones does not pay all the Part D -IRMAA amounts owed by the due date of the May bill. CMS generates a disenrollment and sends the plan a specific TRC via the daily DTRR. The effective date of the disenrollment will be June 1. An MA organization must send each affected individual a written notice of the disenrollment within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the D TRR indicating disenrollment for non -payment of the Part D - IRMAA. 113 Notice Requirements - MA organizations are required to notify members of their disenrollment due to failure to pay Part D -IRMAA (see Exhibit 21a .) When an individual fails to pay both Part D -IRMAA and the plan premium, and the disenrollment effective date s are the same, the TRC for the disenrollment action will refl ect the first disenrollment transaction that is processed by MARx. For example, i f the plan-generated disenrollment transaction, resulting from the failure to pay plan premiums , is processed by MARx before CMS initiates a disenrollment transaction for failure to pay Part D -IRMAA, the TRC will reflect the plan -generated disenrollment. Thus, plans would issue Exhibit 21 as outlined in Section 50.3 regard ing notice requirements. Similarly , if the CMS -generated disenrollment transaction for failure to pay Part D -IRMAA is processed first, plans will receive the TRC reflecting this action . In such cases, CMS will be unable to process the plan-generated disenrollment transaction (because the individual is already disenrolled) ; however, plans may review th eir own billing records to determine if an individual was slated for disenrollment for non -payment of plan premiums. If so, and the effective date of the disenrollment matches the Part D -IRMAA disenrollment effective date, plans have three options for notifying beneficiar ies: 1. Plans may send the notice for failure to pay Part D -IRMAA (Exhibit 21a); 2. Plans may send both the notice for failure to pay Part D -IRMAA (Exhibit 21a) and the plan notice for failure to pay premiums (Exhibit 21); or 3. Plans may send the p lan notice for failure to pay premiums and include information regarding the Part D -IRMAA disenrollment (Exhibit 21) . Reinstatement for Good Cause - Individuals involuntarily disenrolled from their MA -PD plan for failure to pay Part D -IRMAA have the oppor tunity to ask CMS for reinstatement into the plan from which they were disenrolled. CMS may reinstate enrollment, without interruption of coverage, if the individual demonstrates good cause and pays in full within three (3) calendar months of the disenrollment effective date: The Part D -IRMAA amounts that caused the disenrollment for nonpayment of Part D -IRMAA, and Any plan premium amounts owed at the time he or she was disenrolled. For more information on good cause, see \u00a760.3. 4. 50.2.7 - Unlawful Presence Status The MA organization cannot retain a member in a MA plan if the member is not lawfully present in the United States. The organization may not request from a member any documentation of U.S. citizenship or alien status, as CMS provides the official status to the MA organization. CMS will notify the organization (via D TRR) that the individual is not lawfully present, and C MS will make the disenrollment effective the first day of the month following the notification by CMS . Notice Requirements - Following the receipt of a CMS notification (via D TRR) of the disenrollment due to unlawful presence, CMS strongly suggests that a notice be provided within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the D TRR (see Exhibit 38) so that the member is aware of the loss of coverage in the plan and any erroneous disenrollments can be corrected as soon as possible. See \u00a760.3.1 for cases of possible erroneous disenrollment or notification. 114 50.3 - Optional Involuntary Disenrollments An MA organization may disenroll a member from an MA plan it offers if: Premiums are not paid on a timely basis (\u00a750.3.1); The member engages in disruptive beh avior (\u00a750.3.2); or The member provides fraudulent information on an enrollment request, or if the member permits abuse of an enrollment card in the MA plan (\u00a750.3.3). Notice Requirements - In situations where the MA organization disenrolls the member inv oluntarily for any of the reasons addressed above, the MA organization must send notice of the upcoming disenrollment that meets the following requirements: Advises the member that the MA organization is planning to disenroll the member and why such actio n is occurring; Provides the effective date of termination; and Includes an explanation of the member's right to a hearing under the MA organization's grievance procedures. Unless otherwise indicated, all notices must be mailed to the member before submis sion of the disenrollment transaction to CMS. 50.3.1 - Failure to Pay Premiums 42 CFR 422.74(d) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) MA organizations may not disenroll a member who fails to pay MA plan cost sharing under this provision. However, an MA organization has three options when a member fails to pay the MA plan's basic and supplementary premiums. This includes any Part D late enrollment penalty (per Chapter 4 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual). For each of its MA plans (i.e. each PBP), the MA organization must take action consistently among all members of the discrete plan. For example, an MA organization may have different policies among each of i ts plans, but it may not have different policies within a plan (other than the optional exception for dual -eligible individuals and individuals who qualify for the Part D low income subsidy, as described below). The MA organization may: 1. Do nothing, (i.e. , allow the member to remain enrolled in the same premium plan); 2. Disenroll the member after a grace period and proper notice; or 3. If the member fails to pay the premium for optional supplemental benefits (that is, a package of benefits that the member is not required to accept), but pays the premium for basic and mandatory supplemental benefits, reduce the member's coverage (also known as \"downgrade\") by discontinuing the optional supplemental benefits and retaining the member in the same plan 115 after proper notice. Given these requirements for a downgrade, this option is available only for MA plans that have optional supplemental benefits offered at a higher premium than the basic benefit package. Such an action would be considered an addendum to the member' s original request to enroll in the MA plan, and would not be considered a new enrollment request. Refer to Chapter 4 (Benefits and Beneficiary Protections) for a definition of \"basic benefit,\" \"mandatory supplement,\" and \"optional supplemental benefits.\" If an MA organization chooses to disenroll members for failure to pay premiums, it must apply its disenrollment policy consistently to all members of a plan including applying a consistent grace period of no less than two (2) months . Additionally, the or ganization must promptly effectuate such disenrollments at the end of the plan's grace period for payment of premiums. The MA organization may increase the length of the initial grace period or establish a policy of not disenroll ing members for failure to pay the plan premium during the calendar year. For example, an MA organization may increase the grace period from 2 months to 6 months to ease the burden for individuals affected by a natural disaster ; however , it must provide this extended grace period to everyone in the PBP and not only those in the area affected by the natural disaster. An organization must report any changes to its policy for disenrollment for failure to pay premiums to its CMS account manager before implementing such changes . If the MA organization chooses to disenroll the member or reduce coverage, the action may only be accomplished after the MA organization has made a reasonable effort to collect the premium and notice has been provided (as described below). If payment has not been received within the grace period, the individual will be disenrolled (or coverage reduced, as applicable). Organizations may not disenroll members for failure to pay premiums (or notify them of impending disenrollment) in cases where the member has requested that premiums be withheld from his/her Social Security benefit check until the organization receives a reply from CMS indicating that the member's request has been rejected. The organization must then notify the member of the premium owed, pr ovide the appropriate grace period, and comply with other applicable requirements prior to disenrolling the member. Organizations may not involuntarily disenroll individuals who are considered to be in premium withhold status by CMS. Individuals who have requested premium withhold are considered to remain in premium withhold status until either (1) CMS notifies the organization that the premium - withhold request has rejected, failed, or been unsuccessful; or (2) the member requests that he/she be billed directly. Only after one of these actions occurs may a member's status be changed to \"direct bill.\" Once the member is considered to be in \"direct bill\" status, the organization must notify the member of the premium owed and provide the appropriate grace p eriod, as described below. Organizations must always provide members the opportunity to pay premiums owed before initiating any disenrollment action. However, even if a member's premium payment status has been changed to \"direct bill,\" if the member can demonstrate that Social Security Administration (SSA) or the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) has withheld Part C and/or Part D premiums during the cover age month(s) in question, the member will be considered to remain in premium withhold status. Such a member cannot be disenrolled for failure to pay his/her premium(s), whether or not the organization actually receives these premiums on a timely basis. 116 Example 1 - Incorrect Continuation of Premium Withhold: Individual was enrolled in Plan A and selected premium withhold. Individual subsequently enrolls in Plan B and does not select premium withhold. Upon receiving a direct bill from Plan B, the individua l provides Plan B with proof that a premium deduction continues from his SSA benefit check. Since the member provided Plan B with evidence that a premium amount is currently being deducted from his check, Plan B cannot initiate the process to disenroll th e individual for failure to pay premiums. Plan B must work with CMS to obtain appropriate premium reimbursement. Further, an individual will continue to be considered in premium withhold status if an organization is notified by CMS that the member's requ est for premium withholding is not successful as a result of systems/fund transfer issues between CMS and SSA or RRB, or between CMS and the organization. CMS recognizes that in some instances organizations have not received premium amounts in their monthl y CMS plan payment for members who have elected SSA or RRB withholding; however, organizations cannot hold their members responsible for such issues, nor penalize them by attempting to disenroll them from their plan. Therefore, the organization may not initiate the billing (and subsequent disenrollment process, if necessary) until a member is in \"direct bill\" status. Example 2 - Incorrect Data Due to Systems Miscommunication: An individual requests premium withhold, and Plan A correctly submits the request to CMS. The transaction request is submitted successfully by CMS to SSA or RRB and the appropriate premium amount is deducted from the individual's SSA or RRB benefit check. However, due to a systems issue between CMS and SSA or RRB, the premium withhold data is not correctly reflected in CMS systems. Thus, CMS does not pay the correct premium amount to Plan A. Plan A must work with CMS to obtain appropriate premium reimbursement and may not initiate the disenrollment process for the individual for failur e to pay premiums while the premium continues to be withheld. In addition, organizations may not disenroll a member or initiate the disenrollment process if the organization has been notified that the Part D portion of the premium is being paid by a SPAP, or other payer, and the organization has not yet coordinated receipt of the premium payments wit h the SPAP or other payer (refer to \u00a750.6 of Chapter 14 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual for additional information regarding coordination of premium payments). While the MA organization may accept partial payments, it has the right to ask for full payment within the grace period. If the member does not pay the required amount within the grace period, the effective date of disenrollment or reduction in coverage is the first day of the month after the period ends. Unless the member elects an other MA plan during an applicable election period, any disenrollment processed under these provisions will always result in a change of enrollment request to Original Medicare. The MA organization has the right to take action to collect the unpaid premium s from the beneficiary at any point during or after this process. If a member is disenrolled for failure to pay premiums and attempts to re -enroll in the organization, the MA organization may require the individual to pay any outstanding premiums owed to the MA organization before considering the enrollment request to be \"complete.\" If the individual is involuntarily disenrolled for failure to pay premiums, in order to re -enroll in that plan, or to enroll in another plan, the individual must request enrol lment during a valid period. Payment of past due premiums after the disenrollment date does not create an opportunity for 117 reinstatement into the plan from which the individual was disenrolled for failure to pay premiums. Likewise, disenrollment for failu re to pay premiums does not, in itself, provide the beneficiary an opportunity (SEP) to enroll in a different MA plan. Calculating the Grace Period An MA organization must provide plan enrollees with a grace period of not less than 2 calendar month s; how ever, it may provide a grace period that is longer than 2 calendar month s, at its discretion (e.g. organizations may elect to provide a 3 -month initial grace period to match the Part D -IRMAA initial grace period) , provided that similarly situated enrollees are treated equally . The grace period must be a whole number of calendar months and cannot include fractions of months . The grace period cannot begin until the individual has been notified of (billed for) the actual premium amount due, with such notice/bi ll specifying the due date for that amount and providing an opportunity to pay. For new enrollees of an MA -PD plan, the MA organization must wait until notified by CMS of the actual Part D premium which the beneficiary is responsible for paying directly b efore the individual can be notified of/billed for the amount due; for these individuals, the due date cannot be until after the organization receives notification from CMS as to the beneficiary's premium and notifies the individual of the amount due. The grace period may begin no earlier than the first of the month for which the premium was unpaid. NOTE: For individuals who have requested communications in an accessible format, the grace period cannot begin until the organization provides notification ( e.g. the bill) in an accessible format. MA organizations have the following options in calculating and applying the grace period. The organization must apply the same option for all members of a plan. Option 1 - MA organizations may consider the grace period to end not less than 2 calendar month s after the first day of the month for which premium is unpaid. If the overdue premium and all other premiums that become due during the grace period (in accordance with the terms of the member's agreement with the MA organization) are not paid in full by the end of the grace period, the MA organization may terminate or reduce the member's coverage. As mentioned previously, the individual must be notified of/billed for the actual premium amount due before the premium can be considered \"unpaid.\" For new enrollees, at a minimum, this cannot occur until CMS notifies the organization of the total premium due from the individual. Upon CMS notification, the organization would notify the individual of the amount due, with a prospective due date. Under this scenario, MA organizations are encouraged to send subsequent notices as reminders or to show that additional premiums are due. Subsequent notices, therefore, should determine the expiration date of the grace period by reference to this date. Notice requirements are summarized in this section under the heading \"notice requirements.\" EXAMPLE A: Plan XYZ has a 2-month grace period for premium payment. Plan member Mr. Stone's premium was due on February 1, 2009. He did not pay this premium and on February 7th, the MA organization sent an appropriate notice. Mr. Stone ignores this notice and any subsequent premium bills. The grace period is the months of February and March . If Mr. Stone does not pay his plan premium before the end of March , he will be disenrolled as of April 1, 2009. 118 EXAMPLE B: Plan QRS has a 3 -month gra ce period for premium payment. Plan member Mrs. Monsoon's premium was due on July 1, 2009. She did not pay this premium and on July 6th, the MA organization sent an appropriate notice. Mrs. Monsoon ignores this notice and subsequent premium bills. The grace period is the months of July , August and September . If Mrs. Monsoon does not pay her owed premiums by the end of this period ( September 30 ), she will be disenrolled effective October 1, 2009. In short, the MA organization may require that the membe r pay the overdue premiums in full within the grace period, as well as all other payments becoming due within that period, in order to avoid disenrollment (or a reduction in coverage, where applicable). If the MA organization requires the member to make f ull payment within the grace period and pay all premiums falling due within that period; however, the MA organization must state so in its initial delinquency notice to the member. Option 2 - MA organizations may use a \"rollover\" approach in applying the grace period. Under this scenario, the grace period would begin on the first of the month for which the premium is unpaid, but if the member makes a premium payment within the grace period, the grace period stops and is revised to reflect the new disenrol lment date, depending on the number of months for which premiums are received. The member would then have a new grace period beginning on the 1st day of the next month for which the premium is due. The subsequent notice also would have to be sent within 15 calendar days, as described below , of the next premium due date. This process continues until the member's balance for delinquent premiums is paid in full or until the grace period expires with no premium payments being made, at which time the MA organiza tion may disenroll the member. Organizations are not required to issue new notices each time the member submits a partial premium payment (i.e. less than one month's premium), since this would not result in a change in the proposed disenrollment date. How ever, since payment of at least one month's past -due premium causes the disenrollment date to \"roll over\" (i.e. move forward) commensurate with the number of month's premium received, organizations must issue a notice warning of the potential for involunta ry disenrollment (see Exhibit 19) which includes the new disenrollment date whenever payment of at least one month's premium is received during the grace period. These subsequent notices are required to be sent within 15 calendar days of the premium due da te that follows receipt of the premium payment. EXAMPLE Plan WXY has decided to offer a 2 month grace period for non -payment of plan premiums and has chosen the \"rollover\" approach to calculating the grace period. A member fails to pay his January prem ium due January 1. The MA organization sends a notice to the member on January 7th stating that his coverage will be terminated if the outstanding premium is not paid within the grace period. The notice advises him that his termination date would be March 1. The member then pays the January premium, but does not pay the February premium. The grace period is recalculated to begin on the 1st of the next month for which the premium is unpaid (February 1). On February 9th the MA organization sends a notice to the member reflecting the new grace period and the new anticipated termination date of April 1st. The member pays off his balance in full before the grace period expires; therefore, the member's coverage in the MA plan remains intact. 119 Notice Requirements - If it is the MA organization's policy to disenroll the member or to reduce coverage when a member has not paid premiums, the MA organization must send an appropriate written notice of non- payment of premium to the member within 15 calendar days of the p remium due date (see Exhibit 19 ). The MA organization may send interim notices after the initial notice. In addition to the notice requirements outlined in \u00a750.3 , this notice must: Alert the member that the premiums are delinquent; Provide the member with an explanation of disenrollment procedures advising the member that failure to pay the premiums within the grace period that began on the 1st of the month for which premium was unpaid will r esult in termination or reduction of MA coverage, whichever is appropriate according to the MA organization policy, and the proposed effective date of this action; Explain whether the MA organization requires full payment within the grace period (includi ng the payment of all premiums falling due during the intervening days, when and as they become due, according to the terms of the membership agreement) in order to avoid termination of membership or reduction in benefits; and, Explain the implications of a reduction in coverage (e.g., description of lower level of benefits), if the MA organization policy is to reduce coverage for the nonpayment of optional supplemental benefit premiums. If a notice is returned to the organization as undeliverable, the or ganization should immediately implement its procedure for researching a potential change of address (see \u00a7\u00a750.2.1.3 and 50.2.1.4) as well. T he beneficiary may have moved out of the service area . If the organization confirms the permanent move such that a d isenrollment date earlier than the end of the grace period is required, the organization must disenroll the beneficiary for the earlier disenrollment date. If a member does not pay within the grace period, and the MA organization's policy is to disenroll the member, the MA organization must notify the member in writing providing the effective date of the member's disenrollment (refer to Exhibit 20) and submit a disenrollment transaction to CMS. The disenrollment notice to the individual and the transactio n to CMS must be sent within 3 business days following the last day of the grace period; however, in no case may the disenrollment notice to the individual be sent after the transaction is submitted to CMS. In the event the organization submits a disenroll ment request to CMS and later learns that payment was received timely, a reinstatement request must be submitted to CMS (or its designee). In addition, CMS strongly encourages that MA organizations send final confirmation of disenrollment to the member aft er receiving the D TRR (refer to Exhibit 21 for a model letter). If a member does not pay within the grace period, and the MA organization policy is to reduce coverage by eliminating optional supplemental benefits within the current plan, for the nonpaymen t of optional supplemental benefit premiums, the MA organization must notify the member in writing no later than 3 business days after the expiration of the grace period that the MA organization is reducing 120 the coverage and provide the effective date of th e change in benefits (refer to Exhibit 22 for a model letter). Optional Exception for Dual -Eligible Individuals and Individuals who Qualify for the Low Income Subsidy MA organizations offering MA -PD plans have the option to retain dually eligible members and individuals who qualify for the low income subsidy (LIS) who fail to pay premiums even if the MA organization has a policy to disenroll members for non -payment of premiums. For MA -only plans, organizations may retain individuals who are dually eligibl e for both Medicare and Medicaid (i.e. individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A and Part B and receive any type of assistance from the Title XIX (Medicaid) program). The MA organization has the discretion to offer this option to dually eligible individuals and individuals who qualify for LIS within each of its MA plans. If the MA organization offers this option in one of its plans, it must apply the policy to all such individuals in that MA plan. The policy to retain individuals is based upon non -payment of premium for the standard benefit package of the MA plan. If the MA organization chooses this option, any dually eligible individual or individual who qualifies for LIS who fails to pay premiums for any optional supplemental benefit offered wou ld be downgraded to the standard benefit package within that MA plan. CMS requires that organizations provide members advance notice of plan policy changes. An MA organization will have the discretion as to how it will notify its members of the change, e .g. in an upcoming newsletter or other member mailing, such as the Annual Notice of Change. CMS recommends a general statement in such notifications to avoid confusing other members for whom the policy does not apply. EXAMPLE : \"If you have Medicaid or rec eive extra help in paying for your Medicare prescription drugs and are having difficulty paying your plan premiums or cost sharing, please contact us.\" The plan must document this policy internally and have it available for CMS review. 50.3.2 - Disruptiv e Behavior 42 CFR 422.74(d)(2) The MA organization may request to disenroll a member if his /her behavior is disruptive to the extent that his /her continued enrollment in the MA plan substantially impairs the MA organization's ability to arrange for or pro vide services to either that particular member or other members of the plan. However, the MA organization may disenroll a member for disruptive behavior only after it has met the requirements of this section and with CMS' approval. The MA organization may not disenroll a member because he/she exercises the option to make treatment decisions with which the MA organization disagrees, including the option of no treatment and/or no diagnostic testing. The MA organization may not disenroll a member because he/sh e chooses not to comply with any treatment regimen developed by the MA organization or any health care professionals associated with the MA organization. Before requesting CMS' approval of disenrollment for disruptive behavior, the MA organization must make a serious effort to resolve the problems presented by the member. Such efforts must include 121 providing reasonable accommodations, as determined by CMS, for individuals with mental or cognitive conditions, including mental illness and developmental disabilities. The MA organization must also inform the individual of his or her right to use the organization's grievance procedures. The MA organization must submi t documentation of the specific case to CMS for review. This includes documentation: Of the disruptive behavior; Of the MA organization's serious efforts to resolve the problem with the individual; Of the MA organization's effort to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, if applicable, in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act; Establishing that the member's behavior is not related to the use, or lack of use, of medical services; Describing any extenuating ci rcumstances cited under 42 CFR 422.74(d)(2)(iii) and (iv); That the MA organization provided the member with appropriate written notice of the consequences of continued disruptive behavior (see Notice Requirements ); and That the MA organization then provided written notice of its intent to request involuntary disenrollment (see Notice Requirements). The MA organization must submit to its CMS Regional Office account manager : The above documentation; The thorough explanation of the reason for the request detailing how the individual's behavior has impacted the MA organization's ability to arrange for or provide services to the individual or other members of the MA plan; Member information, including age, diagnosis, mental status, functional status , a description of his or her social support systems and any other relevant information; Statements from providers describing their experiences with the member; and Any information provided by the member. The MA organization may request that CMS consider prohibiting re -enrollment in the MA plan (or plans) offered by the MA organization in the service area. The MA organization's request for involuntary disenrollment for disruptive behavior must be complet e, as described above . The CMS Regional Office will review this documentation and consult with CMS Central Office (CO), including staff with appropriate clinical or medical expertise, and decide whether the organization may involuntarily disenroll the mem ber. Such review will include any 122 documentation or information provided either by the organization and the member (information provided by the member must be forwarded by the organization to the CMS RO) . CMS will make the decision within 20 business days a fter receipt of all the information required to complete its review. The CMS will notify the MA organization within 5 (five) business days after making its decision. The Regional Office will obtain Central Office concurrence before approving an involunta ry disenrollment. The disenrollment is effective the first day of the calendar month after the month in which the organization gives the member a written notice of the disenrollment, or as provided by CMS. Any disenrollment processed under these provisions will always result in a change of enrollment request to Original Medicare. If the request for involuntary disenrollment for disruptive behavior is approved, CMS may require the MA organization to provide reasonable accommodations to the individual in su ch exceptional circumstances that CMS deems necessary. An example of a reasonable accommodation in this context is that CMS could require the MA organization to delay the effective date of involuntary disenrollment to coordinate with an MA enrollment request or Part D enrollment period that would permit the individual an opportunity to obtain other coverage. If necessary, CMS will establish an SEP on a case - by-case basis. Notice Requirements The disenrollment for disruptive behavior proc ess requires 3 (three) written notices: 1. Advance notice to inform the member that the consequences of continued disruptive behavior will be disenrollment; 2. Notice of intent to request CMS' permission to disenroll the member; and 3. A planned action notice advising that CMS has approved the MA organization's request. Advance Notice Prior to forwarding an involuntary disenrollment request to CMS, the MA organization must provide the member with written notice describing the behavior it has identified as di sruptive and how it has impacted the MA organization's ability to arrange for or provide services to the member or to other members of the MA plan. The notice must explain that his /her continued behavior may result in involuntary disenrollment and that cessation of the undesirable behavior may prevent this action. The MA organization must include a copy of this notice and the date it was provided to the member in any information forwarded to CMS . NOTE: If the disruptive behavior ceases after the member receives notice and then later resumes, the MA organization must begin the process again. This includes sending another advance notice. Notice of Intent If the member's disruptive behavior continues despite the MA organization's efforts, then the MA organization must notify him/her of its intent to request CMS' permission to disenroll him/her for disruptive behavior. This notice must also advise the member of his/her right to use the organization's grievance procedures and to submit any information or explanation. Refer to Chapter 13, \"Grievances, Organizations Determinations, and Appeals,\" for the appropriate procedures for grievances. The MA 123 organizatio n must include a copy of this notice and the date it was provided to the member in any information forwarded to CMS. Planned Action Notice If CMS permits an MA organization to disenroll a member for disruptive behavior, the MA organization must provide the member with a written notice that, in addition to the notice requirements outlined in \u00a750.3, a statement that this action was approved by CMS and meets the requirements for disenrollment due to disruptive behavior described above . The MA organization m ay only provide the member with this required notice after CMS notifies the MA organization of its approval of the request. The MA organization can only submit the disenrollment transaction to CMS after providing the notice of disenrollment (Planned Actio n Notice) to the individual. The disenrollment is effective the first day of the calendar month after the month in which the MA organization gives the member a written notice of the disenrollment, or as provided by CMS. 50.3.3 - Fraud and Abuse 42 CFR 422.74(e)(1) An MA organization may request to cancel the enrollment of a member who knowingly provides, on the enrollment request form or by another enrollment request mechanism, fraudulent information that materially affects the determination of an individual's eligibility to enroll in th e plan. The organization may also request to disenroll a member who intentionally permits others to use his/her enrollment card to obtain services or supplies from the plan or any authorized plan provider. Such a disenrollment is effective the first day of the calendar month after the month in which the organization gives the member the written notice. When such a cancellation or disenrollment occurs, the organization must immediately notify the CMS RO so the Office of the Inspector General may initiate an investigation of the alleged fraud and/or abuse. Any disenrollment processed under these provisions will always result in a change of enrollment to Original Medicare. Notice Requirements - The MA organization must give the member a written notice of the disenrollment that contains the information required at \u00a750.3. 50.4 - Processing Disenrollments 50.4.1 - Voluntary Disenrollments After receipt of a completed disenrollment request from a member, the MA organization is responsible for submitting the dis enrollment transaction to CMS in a timely, accurate fashion. Such transmissions must occur within 7 calendar days of receipt of the completed disenrollment request, in order to ensure the correct effective date. 124 The MA organization must maintain a system for receiving, controlling, and processing voluntary disenrollments from the MA organization. This system should include: Dating each disenrollment request as of the date it is received (regardless of whether the request is complete at the time it is rece ived by the MA organization) to establish the date of receipt; Dating supporting documents for disenrollment requests as of the date they are received; Processing disenrollment requests in chronological order by date of receipt of completed disenrollment requests; Transmitting disenrollment information to CMS within 7 calendar days of the receipt of the completed disenrollment request from the individual or the employer or union (whichever applies). If the disenrollment information is received through th e employer or union, the MA organization must obtain the member's written disenrollment request from the employer or union; For disenrollment requests received by the MA organization, notifying the member in writing within ten calendar days after receivin g the member's written request, to acknowledge receipt of the completed disenrollment request, and to provide the effective date (see Exhibit 11 for a model letter). MA organizations are encouraged, but not required, to follow up with a confirmation of dis enrollment letter after receiving CMS confirmation of the disenrollment from the DTRR; For all other voluntary disenrollments (i.e., voluntary disenrollments made by the beneficiary through 1 -800-MEDICARE, by enrolling in another MA plan or PDP or by cons enting to passive enrollment into a Medicare -Medicaid demonstration plan , which the MA organization would not learn of until receiving the D TRR), notifying the member in writing to confirm the effective date of disenrollment within ten calendar days of the availability of the TRR (see Exhibit s 12 and 12c for model letter s). This notice requirement does not apply to a disenrollment resulting from a member switching from one benefit package to another within the same organization (i.e., a PBP change) , unless enrollment in the new PBP is the result of passive enrollment into a Medicare -Medicaid demonstration plan. 50.4.2 - When the Disenrollment Request is Incomplete When the disenrollment request is incomplete, the MA organization must document all efforts to obtain additional documentation to complete the disenrollment request and have an audit trail to document why additional documentation was needed before the request could be considered complete. The organization must make this determination, and within 10 calendar days of receipt of the disenrollment request, must notify the individual that additional information is needed. If a written disenrollment request is submitted and the signature is not included, the MA organization may verify with the individ ual with a phone call and document the contact, rather than return the written request as incomplete. 125 For AEP disenrollment requests, additional documentation to make the request complete must be received by December 7 , or within 21 calendar days of the request for additional information (whichever is later). For all other enrollment periods, additional documentation to make the request complete must be received by the end of the month in which the disenrollment request was initially received, or wi thin 21 calendar days of the request for additional information (whichever is later). 50.4.3 - Involuntary Disenrollments The MA organization is responsible for submitting involuntary disenrollment transactions to CMS in a timely, accurate fashion. The MA organization must maintain a system for controlling and processing involuntary disenrollments from the MA organization. This includes: Maintaining documentation leading to the decision to involuntarily disenroll the member; and For all involuntary dis enrollments except disenrollments due to death and loss of Medicare Parts A and/or B, notifying the member in writing of the upcoming involuntary disenrollment, including providing information on grievances rights. In addition, CMS strongly encourages MA organizations to send confirmation of involuntary disenrollment to ensure the member discontinues use of MA organization services after the disenrollment date. 50.5 - Disenrollments Not Legally Valid When a disenrollment is not legally valid, a reinstate ment action may be necessary (refer to \u00a760.3 for more information on reinstatements). In addition, the reinstatement may result in a retroactive disenrollment from another plan. Since optional involuntary disenrollments (as stated in \u00a750.3) are considered legal and valid disenrollments, individuals would not qualify for reinstatements in these cases. A voluntary disenrollment that is not complete, as defined in \u00a710, is not legally valid. In addition, there are instances in which a disenrollment that appears to be complete can turn out to be legally invalid. For example, automatic disenrollments due to an erroneous death indicator or an erroneous loss of Medicare Part A or Part B indicator are not legally valid. The CMS also does not regard a voluntary disenrollment as actually complete if the member or his/her legal representative did not intend to disenroll from the MA organization. If there is evidence that the member did not intend to disenroll from the MA organizatio n, the MA organization should submit a reinstatement request to CMS (or its designee). Evidence that a member did not intend to disenroll may include: A disenrollment request signed by the member when a legal representative should be signing for the member; or Request by the member for cancellation of disenrollment before the effective date (refer to \u00a760.2 for procedures for processing cancellations). 126 Discontinuation of payment of premiums alone does not necessarily indicate that the member has made an informed decision to disenroll. In contrast, CMS believes that a member's deliberate attempt to disenroll from a plan (e.g. sending a written request for disenrollment to the MA organization, or calling 1 -800-MEDICARE) implies intent to disenroll. Therefore, unless other factors indicate that this disenrollment is not valid, what appears to be a deliberate, member -initiated disenrollment should be considered valid. 50.6 - Disenrollment of Grandfathered Members As discussed in \u00a720.6, any individual who wa s enrolled in a \u00a71876 risk plan effective December 1, 1998, or earlier, and remained enrolled with the risk plan on December 31, 1998, automatically continued to be enrolled in the MA organization on January 1, 1999, even if he/she was not entitled to Medi care Part A or did not live in an MA plan service area or MA organization continuation area. Disenrollment procedures for grandfathered members are generally the same as those for other members. The MA organization must disenroll any grandfathered member if: The member dies; The member loses either Medicare Part A or Part B (or for Part B only members, enrollment in Medicare Part B ends for the member); The member permanently moves into the continuation area, but does not choose to continue enrollment o r moves to an area that is out of the service or continuation area; The member permanently moves out of the vicinity , making continued enrollment no longer reasonable. For example, a move of only a short distance may not affect the member's ability to continue to access the plan ; therefore , continued enrollment would be reasonable; or, The MA organization contract is t erminated or the service area or continuation area is reduced with respect to all MA individuals who live in the area where the individual resides. NOTE: The member may be offered the option to continue enrollment, as described in \u00a750.2.4. 50.7 - Disenro llment Procedures for Employer/Union Sponsored Coverage Terminations When the contract between an employer or union group and an MA organization is terminated, or the employer/union determines that a beneficiary is no longer eligible to participate in the employer/union sponsored MA plan2, the MA organization has the option to follow one of two procedures to disenroll beneficiaries from the current employer/union sponsored MA plan in which the individual is enrolled: 2 The employer/union establishes criteria for its retirees to participate in the employer/union sponsored MA plan. These criteria are exclusive of and in addition to the eligibility criteria for MA enrollment. Eligibility criteria to participate and 127 For both of the following options, the MA organization must ensure that the employer or union agrees to the following: The employer or union will provide the MA organization with timely notice of contract termination or the ineligibility of an individual to participate in the employer or union group sponsored MA plan. Such notice must be prospective, not retroactive. The employer or union must provide a prospective notice to its members alerting them of the termination event and of other insurance options that may be available to them through their employer or union. Option 1: Enroll the individual(s) in another MA plan (i.e. individual plan) offered by the same MA organization unless the beneficiary makes another choice. The individual must be eligible to enroll in this plan, including residing in the plan's service area. The individual plan selected for this option must be the same type of plan. For example, if the employer/union sponsored plan was an MA -PD coordinated care plan, the individual plan in this option must be an MA -PD coor dinated care plan. Beneficiaries may elect another MA plan offered by the employer or union, join Original Medicare or join another MA plan as an individual member instead of electing the individual MA plan offered by the same MA organization . If the beneficiary prefers not to be enrolled in the individual plan, he/she may contact the MA organization. If the beneficiary would prefer enrolling in a different MA plan as an individual member, he/she must submit an enrollment request to his/her newly chose n MA organization. If the individual takes no other action, he/she will become a member of the individual plan offered by the same MA organization that offered the employer/union sponsored plan. MA Notice requirements - The MA organization (or the emplo yer or union, acting on its behalf) must provide prospective notice to the beneficiary that his/her plan is changing, including information about benefits, premiums, and/or copayments, at least 21 calendar days prior to the effective date of enrollment in the individual plan. Option 2 : Disenroll individual(s) f rom the employer/union sponsored MA plan to Original Medicare following prospective notice. MA Notice requirements - The MA organization (or the employer or union, acting on its behalf) must provide prospective notice to the beneficiary that his/her plan enrollment is ending at least 21 calendar days prior to the effective date of the disenrollment. The notice must include information about other individual plan options the beneficiary may choose and how to request enrollment. receive employer/union sponsored benefits may include spouse/family status, payment to the employer/union of the individual's part of the premium, or other criteria determined by the employer/union. 128 If the employer/union sponsored plan was an MA -PD plan, the individual must be advised that the disenrollment action means the individual will not have Medicare drug coverage. Notice must include information about the potential for late -enrollment penalties that may apply in the future. The MA organization must outline in its written policies and procedures the option(s) it follows and must apply the same option for all members of a particular employer/union sponsored plan. It is the MA organization's responsibility to ensure tha t the required elements of the disenrollment procedures described above are understood by the employer or union and are part of the agreement with each employer or union, including contract termination notification requirements. 50.8 - Disenrollment Procedures for Medicare MSA Plans Members of Medicare MSA plans may only disenroll in writing through the MA organization offering the Medicare MSA plan; they may not disenroll through 1 -800-MEDICARE. Election periods and effective dates for disenrollment from Medicare MSA plans are outlined in \u00a730.7. MA organizations offering Medicare MSA plans must otherwise follow the disenrollment policies and procedures outlined in \u00a7\u00a750.2 through 50.5. 129 60 - Post-Enrollment Activities 42 CFR 422. 60 & 422.66 Post-enrollment activities begin after the MA organization receives the enrollment request from the individual (e.g., cancellations) and last until a decision is made with respect to an individual's enrollment request (e.g., retroactive transactions). 60.1 - Multiple Transactions Multiple transactions occur when CMS receives more than one enrollment request for the same individual with the same effective date in the same reporting period. An individual may generally not be enrolled in more than one MA, cost, HCP P or PDP plan at any given time (however, an individual may be simultaneously enrolled in a cost plan and a separate PDP plan or in certain MA plan types and a separate PDP plan). Generally, the last enrollment request the beneficiary makes during an enr ollment period will be accepted as the plan into which the individual intends to enroll. If an individual elects more than one plan for the same effective date and with the same application date, the first transaction successfully processed by CMS will tak e effect. Because simultaneous enrollment in certain MA plan types and a separate PDP is permitted, CMS systems will accept both enrollments. Generally, given the use of the application date to determine the intended enrollment choice, retroactive enroll ments will not be processed for multiple transactions that reject because the enrollment requests have the same application date. EXAMPLES Two MA organizations receive enrollment forms from one individual. MAO #1 receives a form on March 4th and MAO #2 r eceives a form on March 10. Both organizations submit enrollment transactions, including the applicable effective date and application date. The enrollment in MAO #2 will be the transaction that is accepted and will be effective on April 1 because the application date on the enrollment transaction is the later of the 2 submitted. Both plans receive the appropriate reply on the D TRR. Two MA organizations (MAOs) receive enrollment requests from one individual for an April 1 effective date. MAO #1 receives a paper enrollment form with all required information on March 5th. The beneficiary completed an enrollment request for MAO #2 by telephone on the same day, March 5th. Both enrollment requests have the same application date, since they were received by the MAO on the same date. Both enrollments were submitted to CMS prior to the April cut -off date. MAO #1 transmitted the enrollment to CMS on March 5th, the day it received the enrollment request; however, MAO #2 waited until March 8th to transmit the enrollm ent to CMS. The enrollment for MAO #1 will be the transaction that is effective on April 1, as it was the first transaction successfully processed by CMS. In the event a rejection for a multiple transaction is reported to the MA organization, the organiza tion may contact the individual. If the individual wishes to enroll in a plan offered by the organization that received the multiple transaction reject, s/he must submit a new enrollment request during a valid enrollment period. 130 60.2 - Cancellations Cancellations may be necessary in cases of mistaken enrollment made by an individual and/or mistaken disenrollment made by a member. Unless otherwise directed by CMS, an individual may cancel his/her enrollment (or disenrollment) request only by contacting th e organization prior to the effective date of the enrollment (or disenrollment) . For enrollments into employer or union sponsored plans, cancellations received by the employer or union prior to the enrollment effective date are also acceptable. If a canc ellation occurs after CMS records have changed, retroactive disenrollment and reinstatement actions may be necessary. Refer to \u00a7\u00a760.3 and 60.5. If a beneficiary verbally requests a cancellation, the MA organization should document the request. MA organiza tions have the right to request that a cancellation be in writing. However, they may not delay processing of a cancellation until the request is made in writing if they have already received a verbal cancellation request from the beneficiary. For facilita ted enrollment as described in \u00a740.1.5 of this chapter, a beneficiary may cancel the enrollment and affirmatively decline Part D benefits by telephone. The MA organization may not require these cancellations in writing. 60.2.1 - Cancellation of Enrollmen t An individual's enrollment request can be cancelled only if the cancellation request is received by the organization prior to the effective date of the enrollment via phone, in writing or in person , unless otherwise directed by CMS. To ensure the canc ellation is honored, the MA organization should not transmit the enrollment to CMS. If, however, the organization had already transmitted the enrollment by the time it receives the valid request for cancellation, it must submit a cancellation transaction to CMS to cancel the now -void enrollment transaction. In the event the cancellation transaction fails or the MA organization has other difficulty, the MA organization must submit the request to cancel the action to the CMS Retroactive Processi ng Contrac tor in order to cancel the enrollment. When canceling an enrollment transaction, the MA organization must send a letter to the individual that states that the cancellation is being processed (see Exhibit 25). This notice should be sent within ten calendar days of receipt of the cancellation request. This notice must inform the member that the cancellation should result in the individual remaining enrolled in the health plan in which he/she was originally enrolled, so long as the individual remai ns eligible to be enrolled in that health plan . An MA organization may submit a transaction to cancel only those enrollment transactions it submitted. To cancel an enrollment, the MA organization must submit a n enrollment cancellation transaction (transaction code 80) with an effective date equal to the effective date of the enrollment being cancelled . If the member's request for cancellation occurs after the effective date of the enrollment, the cancellation generally cannot be processed. (An exception to this is a cancellation requested during the Outbound Education and Verification (OEV) process.) The organization must inform the beneficiary 131 that he/she is a member of its MA plan. If he/she wants to return to the other MA plan he/she will have to submit an enrollment request during a valid election period for a prospective enrollment effective date. If the member wants to return to Original Medicare instead of returning to his/her previous plan , the member must be instructed to disenroll f rom the previous plan as described in \u00a750.1 of this chapter. The member must be informed that the disenrollment must be made during an election period (described in \u00a730.5) and will have a current effective date (as pre scribed in \u00a730.5), and must be instructed to continue to use plan services until the disenrollment goes into effect. Regardless of the plan personnel receiving the request, the plan must document all contact with the beneficiary associated with the cancel lation request. When an organization receives notification of an individual's reinstatement, the organization has ten (10) calendar days to send the individual a notice of reinstatement (Exhibit 25a). CANCELLATION OF MEDICARE MSA ENROLLMENT REQUEST: An individual who elects a Medicare MSA plan during an AEP, and who has never before enrolled in a Medicare MSA plan, may revoke (i.e., \"cancel\") that enrollment request, preferably by December 7 (but law allows beneficiaries to do so by December 15) of the year in which s/he requested enrollment in the Medicare MSA plan. This cancellation will ensure the enrollment request does not go into effect on January 1. After December 7 and up to December 15, the beneficiary may only return to Original Medicare and ca nnot enroll into another MA plan or into a stand -alone PDP. 60.2.2 - Cancellation of Disenrollment A member's disenrollment can be canceled only if the request is made prior to the effective date of the disenrollment, unless otherwise directed by CMS. To ensure the cancellation is honored, the MA organization should not transmit the disenrollment to CMS. If, however, the organization had already transmitted the disenrollment by the time it receives the verbal request for cancellation, it must submit a cancellation of disenrollment transaction , transaction code 81, to CMS to cancel the now -void disenrollment transaction. In the event the MA organization has submitted the disenrollment and is unable to submit the transaction code 81 , or has other difficulty, the organization should submit the request to cancel the action to the CMS Retroactive Processing Contractor in order to cancel the disenrollment. An MA organization may submit a transaction to cancel only those disenrollment transactions it submitted. To submit an action to cancel a disenrollment, the MA organization must submit a transaction code 81 (cancellation of dis enrollment), with the effective date equal to the effective date of the disenrollment being cancelled. The MA organization must send a letter to the member that states that the cancellation is being processed and instructs the member to continue using MA plan services (see Exhibit 26). This notice should be sent within ten calendar days of receipt of the cancellation request. Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of confirmation of the individual's reinstatement, the organization must send the member written notification of the reinstatement (Exhibit 25a). 132 If the member's request for cancellation occurs after the effective date of the disenrollment, the cancellation cannot be processed. In some cases, reinstatement due to a mistaken disenrollment will be allowed, as outlined in \u00a760.3.2. If a reinstatement will not be allowed, the MA organization should instruct the member to submit a new enrollment request during a valid election period (described in \u00a730), and with a current effective date, as prescribed in \u00a730.5. 60.2.3 - When A Cancellation Transaction is Rejected by CMS Systems (Transaction Reply Code (TRC) 284) When an MA organization receives a TRC 284 (Cancellation Rejected), while the cancellation remains valid, it could not be processed automatically in CMS' systems. The MA organization must investigate the circumstances behind the rejection. If the rejection was due to incorrect data on the transaction , the MA organization must correct the data and resubmit it to CMS . If the rejection was not due to such an error, and the request to cancel is valid, the MA organization must promptly submit the request to CMS (or its designee) for resolution. 60.2.4 - Cancellation Due to Notification from CMS (TRC 015) When an MA organization receives a TRC 015 (Enrollment Cancelled), it indicates that an enrollment must be cancelled. A cancellation may be the result of an action on the part of the beneficiary, CMS or another plan. Within ten (10) days of receiving the TRC 015, the plan must send the individual an acknowledgment notice of the cancellation (Exhibit 25b). 60.3 - Reinstatements Reinstatements may be necessary if a disenrollment is not legally valid (refer to \u00a750.5 to determine whether a disenrollment is not legally valid) or if the circumstances justify a reinstatement . The most common reasons warranting reinstatements are: 1. Disenrollment due to erroneous death indicator; 2. Disenrollment due to erroneous loss of Medicare Part A or Part B indicator; 3. Disenrollment due to erroneous incarceration or unlawful presence inf ormation; 4. Reinstatements Based on Beneficiary Cancellation of New Enrollment; 5. Plan error ; 6. Demonstration of good cause for failure to pay plan premiums or Part D -IRMAA timely. When a disenrolled individual contacts the MA organization to state that he or she was disenrolled due to item 1 (erroneous death indicator) , item 2 (erroneous loss of Medicare Part A or Part B indicator) or item 5 (plan error) , and states that he or she wants to remain a member of the MA plan, the MA 133 organization must instruct t he member in writing to continue to use MA plan services (refer to Exhibit s 15, 16 and 17). The MA organization must send the notice within ten (10) calendar days of the individual's contact with the organization to report the erroneous disenrollment. Accordingly, plan systems should indicate active membership as of the date the organization instructs the individual to continue to use plan services. When a disenrolled individual contacts the MA organization about either item 3 ( erroneous incarceration or unlawful presence information), item 4 ( reinstatement based on enrollment cancellation of new enrollment ) or item 6 (good cause ), plans should follow the guidance outlined below pertaining to those unique situations. A reinstatement is viewed as a correction necessary to \"erase\" an invalid disenrollment action , and, as such, does not require an election period . Therefore, reinstatements may be made b ack to a date when an MA plan was closed for enrollment. Payment alone of past due premiums after the disenrollment date does not create an opportunity for reinstatement into the plan from which the individual was disenrolled for failure to pay premiums. CMS (or its designee) will review requests for reinstatements on a case -by-case basis. Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of DTRR confirmation of the individual's reinstatement, the organization must send the member notification of the reinstatement (Exhibit 25a). 60.3.1 - Reinstatements for Disenrollment Due to Erroneous Death Indicator, or Erroneous Loss of Medicare Part A or Part B , Erroneous Incarceration Information, or Erroneous Unlawful Presence Information A member must be reins tated if he or she was disenrolled in error , since the individual continues to be eligible. This may occur in the following situations: Erroneous death indicator; Erroneous loss of Part A or Part B; Erroneous lawful presence status; or Erroneous inc arceration information. As outlined in 42 CFR 422.74(c), MA organizations have the option of sending notification of disenrollment due to: Death; Loss of Part A or Part B entitlement; or Unlawful presence in the U.S. 134 The CMS strongly suggests that MA orga nizations send these notices in these three situations , to ensure any erroneous disenrollments are corrected as soon as possible. Refer to Exhibit s 13, 14 and 38 for model letters. If CMS involuntarily disenrolls an individual due to incarceration, a not ice is required because the individual resides out of the plan's service area. See \u00a750.2.1.5 for notice requirements for disenrollment due to incarceration. Refer to Exhibit 37. Erroneous disenrollments must be corrected and the corresponding reinstatements processed, regardless of the date on which the individual disputes the erroneous disenrollment or provides evidence of MA eligibility . Reinstatements for erroneous death indic ator or loss of Part A or Part B entitlement: Individuals can dispute the disenrollment due to death indicator or loss of Part A or Part B entitlement. In such cases, the MA organization is expected to acknowledge the individual's request for reinstatemen t and direct him or her to continue to use the MA plan services while the issue is resolved with the Social Security Administration (SSA). Organizations may request that such individuals provide evidence of MA eligibility by a particular date; however, should the individual provide evidence after that date, the error must still be corrected by the MA organization. To request consideration for reinstatement following disenrollment due to erroneous death indicator , erroneous loss of Medicare Part A or Part B , the MA organization must submit to CMS (or its designee) a copy of the letter to the member informing him or her to continue to use MA plan services until the issu e is resolved. The organization must indicate the date the letter was sent. Refer to model letters in Exhibits 15and 16. Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of D TRR confirmation of the individual's reinstatement, the organization must send the member notification of the reinstatement (Exhibit 25a). CMS will attempt to automatically reinstate individuals that were auto -disenrolled by a report of date of death if there is a subsequent date of death correction that impacts the plan enrollment. Reinstatements for erroneous incarceration or unlawful presence status informat ion: Individuals alleging disenrollment due to erroneous incarceration information or erroneous unlawful presence status must have their complaints reviewed by the MA organization and possibly referred to SSA. MA organizations are not required to provide c overage to such individuals while the issue is reviewed by the plan or SSA. For individuals who contest their disenrollment on these bases, the MA organization should check CMS' systems to see if the incarceration or unlawful presence status has been rem oved (via audit notification in MARx) and that the person is otherwise eligible to remain enrolled as of the disenrollment effective date. If the individual is otherwise eligible for enrollment, the reinstatement request may be sent to the CMS Retroactive Processing Contractor (RPC) instead of referring the individual to SSA . However, if CMS systems continue to reflect an incarcerated or unlawful presence status, the plan should refer the beneficiary to SSA so that they may review their records and make corrections, as appropriate. If the information or status is determined to be erroneous by SSA, CMS' systems will be updated. The plan may check CMS systems to see if the incarceration or unlawful presence status has been removed, and, if the person is otherw ise eligible to remain enrolled, may send the reinstatement request to the CMS RPC. T he MA organization will receive notification of the 135 individual's reinstatement from CMS or via the TRR. At that time, services should resume and coverage should be seamles s, as though the individual was never disenrolled. CMS suggests that the organization send the member notification of the reinstatement (Exhibit 25a) within ten (10) days of receipt of DTRR confirmation of the individual's reinstatement. 60.3.2 - Reinstatements Based on Beneficiary Cancellation of New Enrollment As stated in \u00a750.5, deliberate member -initiated disenrollments imply intent to disenroll. Therefore, reinstatements generally will not be allowed if the member deliberately initi ated a disenrollment. An exception is made for those members who were automatically disenrolled because they enrolled in another plan but subsequently cancel led the enrollment in the new plan before the effective date. In this situation, that is, if an individual has since changed his/her mind and wants to remain enrolled in the previous plan, the individual must cancel the enrollment into the new plan, as described in section 60.2.1. When a cancellation of enrollment in a new plan is properly made, the a ssociated automatic disenrollment from the previous MA plan becomes invalid. Upon successful cancellation of enrollment in the new plan, CMS systems will attempt to automatically reinstate enrollment in the previous plan. Because this process is automatic, it is generally not necessary to request reinstatement via the Regional Office or Retroactive Processing Contractor. Within ten (10) days of receipt of D TRR confirmation of the individual's reinstatement, the organization must send the member notification of the reinstatement (Exhibit 25a). In cases where the valid cancellation request is not processed timely or CMS systems cannot complete the request , the new plan must submit a request to the Retroactive Processing Contractor to cancel the enrollment . This request will require complete documentation, including evidence that the beneficiary requested cancellation of enrollment in the new plan within required timeframes. If the previous plan becomes aware of an unsuccessful reinstatement, the previous pl an may contact a CMS Account Manager to investigate the issue with the new plan. If the disenrolled individual contacts the previous plan requesting to remain a member of that plan, the MA organization should inform the individual that reinstatement of e nrollment is an option only if the individual successfully cancels enrollment in the \"new\" plan; accordingly, the organization should refer the individual to the \"new\" plan to inquire about his or her options. 60.3.3 - Reinstatements Due to Mistaken Dise nrollment Due to Plan Error A disenrollment that is not the result of either a valid voluntary request or a valid circumstance that requires involuntary disenrollment is erroneous. When an erroneous disenrollment is the result of plan error, the plan mus t reinstate the individuals who were disenrolled. In the case of an erroneous disenrollment by the organization that is a result of an error the part of the organization, the organization must restore the enrollment in its records. Additionally, the organization must cancel the disenrollment action from C MS's records, if the organization had previously submitted such a transaction to CMS. Organizations must use the disenrollment cancellation function to complete this action for effective dates within the parameters that CMS systems allow for such correcti ons. For effective dates outside these parameters, the organization must process the request 136 according to the guidance for processing retroactive enrollment and disenrollment requests including full documentation and explanation as required . Within ten ( 10) days of receipt of D TRR confirmation of the individual's reinstatement, the organization must send the member notification of the reinstatement (Exhibit 25a). 60.3. 4 - Reinstatements Based on a Determination of Good Cause for Failure to Pay Plan Premiums or Part D -IRMAA Timely If an individual has been involuntarily disenrolled for failure to pay either plan premiums ( under \u00a750.3.1) or Part D -IRMAA ( under \u00a750.2.6), he or she may request reinstatement no later than 60 calendar days following the e ffective date of disenrollment . Reinstatement for good cause, pursuant to 42 CFR 422.74(d)(1)(v), will occur only when : 1. The i ndividual r equests reinstatement within 60 days of disenrollment effective date ; 2. The individual has been determined to meet the criteria specified below (i.e., receives a favorable determination) ; and 3. (a) Within three (3) months of disenrollment for nonpayment of plan premiums, the individual pays in full the plan premium s owed at the time he or she was disenrolled or (b) Within three (3) months of disenrollment for nonpayment of Part D -IRMAA, the individual pays in full the Part D -IRMAA and any plan premiums owed at the time he or she was disenrolled. Criteria for Reinstatement: Reinstatement of enrollment for good cause is provided only in rare circumstances in which the member or his or her authorized representative (i.e. the individual responsible for the member's financial affairs) was unable to make timely payment due to circumstances over which they had no control and they could not reasonably have been expected to foresee. Requests for reinstatement must be accompanied by a credible statement (verbal or written) explaining the unforeseen and uncontrollable circumstances causing the failure to make timely payment. An individual may make only one reinstatement request for good cause in the 60-day period. Generally, these circumstances constitute good cause : A serious illness , institutionalization and/or hospitalization of the member or his or her authorized representative (i.e. the individual responsible for the member 's financial affairs), that lasted for a significant portion of the grace period for plan premium or Part D -IRMAA payment; Prolonged illness that is not chronic in nature, a seri ous (unexpected) complication to a chronic condition or rapid deterioration of the health of the member, a spouse, another person living in the same household, person providing caregiver services to the member, or the member's authorized representative (i. e., the individual responsible for the member's financial affairs) that occurs during the grace period for the plan premium or Part D -IRMAA payment; Recent death of a spouse, immediate family member, person living in the same household or person providing caregiver services to the member, or the member's authorized representative (i.e., the individual responsible for the member's financial affairs) ; or Home was severely damaged by a fire, natural disaster or other unexpected event , such that the member or the member's authorized representative was prevented from making arrangement for payment during the grace period for plan premium or Part D -IRMAA ; 137 An extreme weather -related, public safety or other unforeseen event declared as a Federal or state level of emergency prevented premium payment at any point during the plan premium or Part D -IRMAA grace period. For example, the member's bank or U.S. Post Office closes for a significant portion of the grace period; or For disenrollments effectuated by CM S for failure to pay Part D -IRMAA, Federal government error (i.e., CMS, SSA or RRB) caused the payment to be incorrect or late, and the member was unaware of the error or unable to take action prior to the disenrollment effective date. There may be situat ions in addition to those listed above that result in favorable good cause determinations. I f an individual presents a circumstance which is not captured in the listed examples, it must meet the regulatory standards of being outside of the member's control or unexpected such that the member could not have reasonably foreseen its occurrence, and this circumstance must be the cause for the non- payment of plan premiums or Part D -IRMAA. CMS expects non-listed circumstances will be rare. Examples of circumstanc es that do not constitute good cause include: Allegation that bills or warning notices were not received due to unreported change of address, out of town for vacation, visiting out of town family, etc .; Authorized representative did not pay timely on membe r's behalf; Lack of understanding of the ramifications of not paying plan premiums or Part D -IRMAA; Could not afford to pay premiums during the grace period ; or Need for prescription medicines or other plan services . For examples of cases for favorable an d unfavorable good cause determinations, see Appendix 4. For the purpose of determining good cause for members with authorized representatives, the criteria for both favorable and unfavorable determinations apply as though the authorized representative is the member. The inability to afford premiums or failure to make timely payment by a member or an authorized representative alone is not grounds for a favorable good cause determination and reinstatement. In addition, good cause determinations are not organization determinations related to coverage and, therefore, are not appealable. (See 42 CFR 422, subpart M.) An individual may not make more than one reinstatement request for good cause in the same 60 -day period following disenrollment, including instances in which the initial request resulted in an unfavorable determination. However, an individual has the right to file a grievance against the plan related to the involuntary disenrollment. An individual who has been disenrolled for failure to pay plan premium, regardless of whether he or she has also been assessed Part D -IRMAA , remains disenrolled from the plan and does not have access to plan coverage of services until he or she receive s a favorable good cause determination and the plan receives full payment of the plan premium amounts owed at the time he or she was disenrolled. An individual who has been disenrolled by CMS for failure to pay Part D -IRMAA remains disenrolled from the plan and does not hav e access to plan coverage of services until the reinstatement occurs and is reported to the plan on the D TRR or the plan is contacted by the CMS caseworker after he or she has successfully updated the member's enrollment record in MARx . Once a reinstatement occurs, the 138 individual's disenrollment will be cancelled and his or her coverage will be continuous , assuming the individual continues to be eligible for enrollment in that plan. 60.3.4.1 - Process for Good Cause Determinations for N onpayment of Plan Premiums Pursuant to 42 CFR 422.74(d), CMS has assigned the handling of good cause determinations to plans. When a disenrolled individual initially contacts the MA organization following disenrollment for failure to pay plan premiums and indicates that he or she \"has a good reason for not having paid the premiums\" , the MA organization must : Confirm that the request for reinstatement is being made within 60 calendar days of the disenrollment effective date; Inform the individual that reinstatement is a possibility only if it is determined that his or her failure to make timely payment was due to circumstances over which he or she had no control and could not reasonably have been expected to foresee; Obtain a credible statement from the individual regarding the circumstance that prevented him or her from making timely payment; and Obtain affirmation from the individual indicating his or her willingness and ability to pay all overdue plan premiums within three (3) months of the disenrollment date in order for reinstatement to occur. If all of these preliminary requirements are not met, the individual is not eligible to be considered for reinstatement for good cause. An individual may not make more than one rein statement request for good cause during the same 60 -day period. For example, an individual requesting reinstatement indicates that he had no unusual or unexpected circumstance that caused the nonpayment of premiums and the plan determines that he does not qualify for his case to be revie wed under good cause. The plan is expected to clearly communicate that the individual's request will not be reviewed because the situation does not meet the criteria (e.g ., not unusual or unexpected). The individual remains disenrolled and may not make another request for good cause during the same 60 -day period following the involuntary disenrollment. If all of the above criteria are met, the plan will review the request and will make a favorable or unfavor able good cause determination. CMS expects that plans make such determinations within five (5) business days of initial receipt of the request, so that the individual has a reasonable amount of time to make f ull payment for reinstatement. For requests rece ived by mail, the initial request is considered received by the plan at the time it arrives in the organization's mailbox or mailroom. For requests received by fax, the initial request is considered received by the plan at the time when the fax is receive d on t he organization's fax machine. For requests received by telephone , the initial request is considered received by the plan at the time the organization's representative receives the incoming call. There is no additional time allotted for plans to ga ther information not collected at the point of initial contact. Plans would need to collect any additional data they feel is needed to make a determination and make that determination within five (5) business days of the date on which the indiv idual first contacts the plan. In such cases where the plan does not have sufficient information to determine if the member's circumstances meet the requirements, it should make a good faith effort to collect it within that timeframe (e.g., making multiple attempts on differen t days or at different times). However, if 139 attempts are unsuccessful, the plan must use the information provided with the initial request to make its determination. If the plan makes a favorable determination and there are amounts owed to the pl an for past due premiums, the plan should notify the individual of this decision within three (3) business days of making the determination. If the plan offers immediate payment options, such as payment by credit card via phone, it may provide the notification verbally; however, if the individual does not complete the payment at that time, the plan should issue a written notice to ensure that t he individual has the information necessary to pay the owed amounts. This notice will specify the amount owed (i.e., the premiums owed at the time of disenrollment) , the date by which payment must be received for reinstatement (i.e. , last day of the third month following the disenrollment effective date), where to send payment , and/or other payment options such as credit card or direct withdrawal from a bank account , if offered by the plan. (See Exhibit 22b ). If, at the time the plan makes a favorable de termination , there are no amounts owed to the plan for past due premiums, the plan should notify the individual of this decision either verbally or in writing within three ( 3) business days of making the determination . Exhibit 22e is a model notice for the scenario in which an individual receives a favorable good cause determination and has already paid the amount required for reinstatement. If verbal notification is attempted but unsuccessful, a written notice should be provided. Verbal notification mu st be documented by the plan to meet CMS ' retroactive processing contractor reinstatement submission requirements. If the plan makes an unfavorable determination, the plan should notify the individual of this decision by phone or in writing within three (3) business days of making the determination. If an individual has received a favorable good cause determination, reinstatement in CMS systems may not occur until and unless all required payments are made within three (3) months of the disenrollment effe ctive date. If the individual pays all the owed amounts prior to the three -month deadline, the plan should resume coverage at that time and submit the reinstatement request to the CMS Retroactive Processing Contractor. Plans have additional time beyond the deadline (i.e., three (3) months from the disenrollment effective date) to verify payment by the bank and credit the payment to the member 's account with the plan . To provide adequate protections for individuals who make timely payment of their owed amounts, plans have five (5) calendar days beyond the payment deadline to process the payment and submit the reinstatement request to the CMS Retroactive Processing Co ntractor .. Reinstatements for good cause are considered complete by CMS when TRC 287 (Enrollment Reinstated) is sent by CMS to the plan. Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of DTRR confirmation of the individual's reinstatement, the organization must send the member notification of the reinstatement (Exhibit 25a). In an effort to prevent members from falling behind in premium payments in the future, plans are encouraged to educate them on any automated payment mechanisms their plan offers , as well as the availability of selecting automatic premium withhold through their SSA or RRB benefits. An individual may not be reinstated in cases where: 140 the individual pays all plan premiums owed, but does not receive a favorable good cause determination; or the individual receives a favorable good cause determination, but does not pay the plan premiums owed within three (3) months of the disenrollment effective date. In both of these cases, t he plan may re -enroll the individual for a prospective enrollment ef fective date at the individual 's request only if he or she has a valid election period (i.e. , AEP, SEP, etc.), following enrollment procedures outlined in Sections 30 and 40. Example A: Mr. Smith is disenrolled for failure to pay plan premiums on April 1 . Mr. Smith contacts the plan and makes his request for reinstatement on April 15 and receives a favorable good cause determination on April 23 . The plan notifies Mr. Smith of the amount he owes by June 30 in order to be reinstated into the plan. Mr. Smith pays the amount due on June 15. Mr. Smith is reinstated into the plan. (Note: If Mr. Smith did not pay his owed amount by June 30, he would not be reinstated.) Example B: Mr. Smith is disenrolled by the plan for failure to pay plan premiums on July 1. Mr. Smith mails in his past due amounts to the plan on July 30. He contacts the plan and makes his request on August 10, and does not receive a favorable good cause determination. Mr. Smith may not be reinstated. Example C: Mr. Smith is disenrolled by the plan for failure to pay plan premiums on November 1. Mr. Smith mails in his owed amounts to the plan on December 15, but does not contact the plan to request reinstatement . Thus, Mr. Smith does not have a favorable good cause determination, and he may n ot be reinstated. NOTE: In cases where the involuntary disenrollment for failure to pay plan premiums is the result of plan error, plans should follow the reinstatement process outlined in Section 60.3.3. Plans should not refer these individuals to 1 -800-MEDICARE , nor should these cases be considered for reinstatement for good cause. 60.3.4.2 - Process for Good Cause Determinations for Nonpayment of Part D -IRMAA When a disenrolled individual contacts the MA organization following disenrollment for failure to pay Part D -IRMAA and indicates that he or she \"has a good reason for not paying the Part D -IRMAA,\" the MA organization must advise the individual to contact 1 -800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633-4227; TTY: 1- 877-486-2048) within 60 calendar days of the dise nrollment effective date to make the go od cause reinstatement request. The organization should also inform the individual that in order to be reinstated, he or she must meet specific good cause standards and must pay all overdue plan premiums and Part D-IRMAA amounts within three (3) months of the disenrollment date in order for reinstatement to occur. Once a request is made with CMS via 1 -800-MEDICARE, a Complaint Tracking Module (CTM) case will be generated for CMS caseworker action. The CMS caseworker w ill review the request and will make a favorable or unfavor able good cause determination. If the individual provides any documentation to the plan regarding the inability to make timely payment of the Part D -IRMAA, the plan must provide that documentation to CMS (through the CMS account manager) so that it may be considere d in making the determination. If CMS makes an unfavorable determination, CMS will 141 notify the in dividual of the determination. Notes of the good cause reinstatement request will be capture d in the CTM for CMS and plan viewing. NOTE: Requests for reinstatement are not considered complaints against the plan; therefore, these types of CTM cases are excluded from tracking for the purposes of plan ratings. If CMS makes a favorable determination, a notation will be made in the CTM and the CTM will be sent to the plan. If there are amounts owed to the plan for past due premiums, the plan should send notification to the individual within three (3) business days of being informed of the favorable good cause determination. This notice will specify the amount owed, the date by which payment must be received for reinstatement (i.e., last day of the third month following effective date of disenrollment), where to send payment, and other paym ent options such as credit card or direct withdrawal from a bank account, if offered by the plan. (See Exhibit 22a). Plans have additional time beyond the payment deadline (i.e., three months from the disenrollment effective date) to verify payment by th e bank and credit the payment to the individual's account. To provide adequate protections for individuals who make timely payment of their owed amounts, plans have five (5) calendar days beyond the payment deadline to process the payment and notify CMS v ia CTM. Even if an individual has received a favorable good cause determination, the actual reinstatement will not occur until all required payments are made within three (3) months of the disenrollment effective date. Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of DTRR confirmation of the individual's reinstatement, the organization must send the member notification of the reinstatement (Exhibit 25a). In an effort to prevent members from falling behind in premium payments in the future, plans are encouraged to educate them on any automated payment mechanisms offered by the plan, as well as the availability of automatic premium withhold from SSA or RRB benefits. An individual may not be reinstated in cases where: the individual pays all Part D -IRMAA amounts and any plan premium amounts owed, but does not receive a favorable good cause determination; or the individual receives a favorable good cause determination, but does not pay the Part D - IRMAA amounts and/or any plan premiums owed with three (3) months of the disenrollment effective date. In both of these cases, the plan may re -enroll the individual for a prospective enrollment effective date at the individual's request, but only if he or she has a valid election period (i.e., AEP, SEP, etc.), following enrollment procedures outlined in Sections 30 and 40. Example: Mr. Smith is disenrolled by CMS for failure to pay Part D -IRMAA on August 1. He contacts Medicare and makes his request on September 29 and receives a favorable good cause determination on Oc tober 5. Mr. Smith is also delinquent on his plan premiums. CMS notifies Mr. Smith that he must pay the Part D -IRMAA amount he owes by October 31. The plan notifies Mr. Smith that he must also pay the plan premium amount he owes by October 31. Mr. Smith p ays his Part D-IRMAA owed amount on October 25. Mr. Smith pays his plan premium owed amount on November 5. Because the plan received Mr. Smith's payment for his owed plan premium amount after the due date, Mr. Smith may not be reinstated. (Note: If Mr. Smith had paid both his owed Part 142 D-IRMAA and plan premiums by October 31, the plan would have had the additional five (5) days to process the payment and he would have been reinstated.) 60.4 - Retroactive En rollments If an individual has fulfilled all enrollment requirements, but the MA organization or CMS is unable to process the enrollment for the required effective date (as outlined in \u00a730.5), CMS (or its designee) will process a retroactive enrollment. In addition, auto -enrollment for full -benefit dual eligible as described in \u00a740.1.5 may be retroactive to ensure no coverage gap between the end of Medicaid coverage for Part D drugs and the beginning of Medicare drug coverage. In other limited cases, C MS may determine that an individual is eligible for an SEP due to an extraordinary circumstance beyond his/her control (e.g. a fraudulent enrollment request or misleading marketing practices) and may also permit a retroactive enrollment in an MA plan as ne cessary to prevent a gap in coverage or liability for the late enrollment penalty. Unlike a reinstatement, which is a correction of records to \"erase\" an action, a retroactive enrollment is viewed as an action to enroll a beneficiary into a plan for a n ew time period. Therefore, retroactive enrollments may NOT be made back to a date when an MA plan was closed for enrollment. NOTE: Keep in mind that unless an approved capacity limit applies, all MA plans are open for ICEP, IEP/D, AEP and SEP enrollment r equests; therefore, all MA plans are open for retroactive enrollments for these types of enrollment requests. Occasionally, obtaining the information necessary to complete an enrollment request within the allowable timeframes will extend beyond the CMS systems cut -off date for transaction submission, thus making the effective date of enrollment \"retroactive\" to the current payment month. MA organizations must use the Code 61 enrollment transaction to submit the enrollment transaction directly to CMS within the Current Calendar Month transaction processing timeframe. When a valid request for enrollment has not been communicated to CMS successfully within the required timeframes in this guidance and the Current Calendar Month transaction submission timeframe, MA organizations are required to submit the appropriate documentation to CMS (or its designee) for manua l review and potential action. The request for a retroactive enrollment should be made within the timeframes provided in the Standard Operating Procedures for the CMS Retr oactive Processing Contractor. When an individual has fulfilled all enrollment requirement s, but the organization or CMS has been unable to process the enrollment in a timely manner, the following documentation must be submitted to CMS (or its designee): A copy of signed completed enrollment form (the form must have been signed by the benefici ary (or authorized representative) and received by the organization prior to the requested effective date of coverage, in order to effectuate the requested effective date of coverage); or A copy of the enrollment request record (the enrollment request reco rd must show that the enrollment request was made and received by the organization prior to the requested effective date of coverage). 143 The retroactive enrollment request may be denied if CMS determines that the MA organization did not notify the member th at he/she must use MA plan services during the period covered by the retroactive enrollment request. If the request for retroactive enrollment action is due to plan error, the organization must provide a clear and detailed explanation of the plan error including why the retroactive action is necessary to correct the error. The explanation must include clear information regarding what the organization has communicated to the affected beneficiary throu ghout the period in question. The organization must also include any relevant information or documentation suppor ting the requested correction. Such information could include a copy of the enrollment request form (or clear evidence of the use of another enrollment mechanism) and evidence of notices sent to the beneficiary related to or caused by the error. Special note regarding Regional Office Casework actions When an MA organization is directed by CMS, such as via an RO caseworker, to submit a retroactive enrollment or disenrollment request to resolve a complaint, the organization must provide the following 2 (two) items as documentation to CMS (or its designee): A screen print from the Complaint Tracking Module (CTM) or other documentation showing the CMS RO decision and direction to submit the request to the CMS Retroactive Processing Contractor, and; A copy of the enrollment or disenrollment request, if one is available. Occasionally, due to the nature of casework, this item may not be availabl e. When that occurs, the organization should submit a brief statement of explanation for the missing documentation. 60.5 - Retroactive Disenrollments 42 CFR 422.66 If an enrollment was never legally valid (\u00a740.6) or if a valid request for disenrollment was properly made, but not processed or acted upon (as outlined in the following paragraph), which includes not only system error, but plan error (see \u00a710 for a definition of \"system error\" and \"plan error\"), (or its designee) a retr oactive disenrollment. CMS (or its designee) may also process a retroactive disenrollment if the reason for the disenrollment is related to a permanent m ove out of the plan service area (as outlined in \u00a750.2.1.2), a contract violation (as outlined in 42 CFR 422.62(b)(3)) or other limited exceptional conditions established by CMS (e.g. fraudulent enrollment or misleading marketing practices). When a valid request for disenrollment has not been communicated to CMS successfully within the required timeframes in this guidance and the Current Calendar Month transaction submission timeframe, MA organizations are required to submit the appropriate documentation to CMS (or its designee) for manual review and potential action. Retroactive disenrollment request s can be submitted to CMS (or its designee) by the beneficiary or an MA organization. Requests from an MA organization must include a copy of the disenrollment request, as well as an explanation as to why the disenrollment was not processed correctly. MA organizations must submit retroactive disenrollment requests to CMS (or its designee) within the timeframes provided in the Standard Operating Procedures for the CMS Retroactive Processing Contractor. If CMS approves a request for retroactive 144 disenrollment, the MA organization must return any premium paid by the member for any month for which CMS processed a retroactive disenrollment. In addition, CMS will retrieve any capitation payment for the retroactive period. A retroactive request must be submitted by the MA organization (or by the member) to CMS (or its designee) in cases in which the MA organization has not properly processed a required involuntary disenrollment or acted upon the member's request for disenrollment as required in \u00a750.4.1 of these instructions. A disenrollment request would be considered not properly acted upon or processed if the effective date is a date other than as required in \u00a730.6. If the request for retroactive disenrollment action is due to the MA organization's confirmation of an incarcerated status with a retroactive start date (see \u00a7 50.2.1.3), the organization must provide written confirmation of the incarcerated status , including the start date. Such confirmation could include documentation of telephonic communications. If the request for retroactive action is due to plan error, the organization must provide a clear and detailed explanation of the plan error including why the retroactive action is necessary to correct the error. The explanation must include clear informatio n regarding what the organization has communicated to the affected beneficiary throughout the period in question , including evidence that the beneficiary was notified prospectively of the disenrollment . The organization must also include any relevant infor mation suppor ting the requested correction. Such information could include a copy of the disenrollment request and evidence of notices sent to the beneficiary related to or caused by the error in question and which demonstrate that the retroactive disenrol lment is appropriate under the circumstances. 60.6 - Retroactive Transactions for Employer/Union Group Health Plan (EGHP) Members In some cases an MA organization that has a contract with an EGHP arranges for the employer or union to process enrollment r equests for Medicare -entitled group members who wish to enroll in an employer or union sponsored MA plan. However, there can be a delay between the time the member completes the enrollment request through the EGHP and when the enrollment request is receive d by the MA organization. Therefore, retroactive transactions for these routine delays may be necessary and are pr ovided for under this section. Errors made by an EGHP, such as failing to forward a valid enrollment or disenrollment request within the timef rames described below, must be submitted to CMS (or its designee) for review. Repeated errors may indicate an ongoing problem and therefore will be forwarded to the MA organization's CMS Account Manager for compliance monitoring purposes. The MA organizati on's agreement with the EGHP must include the need to meet the requirements provided in this chapter that ensure the timely submission of enrollment and disenrollment requests to reduce the need for retroactivity and to help avoid such errors. 60.6.1 - EGHP Retroactive Enrollments (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) The effective date of EGHP enrollments cannot be earlier than the date the enrollment request was completed by the beneficiary . The effective date may be retroactive up to, but may not exceed, 90 days 145 from the date the MA organization received the request (which was completed prior to the effective date) from the employer or union group. EXAMPLE In March 2007, the CMS system pr ocessing date was March 13, 2007. Enrollment requests processed by CMS for the March 13, 2007, due date were for the prospective April 1, 2007, payment. For EGHPs, an effective date of March 1, February 1, or January 1 would reflect 30, 60 and 90 days of retroactive payment adjustment, respectively. Therefore, if a completed EGHP enrollment request were to be received by the MA organization on March 5, 2007, the retroactive effective date could be January 1, February 1, or March 1, as long as the enrollmen t request was completed prior to the effective date. NOTE: Keep in mind that unless a CMS -approved capacity limit has been reached , all MA plans are open for ICEP, AEP, and SEP enrollment requests. Therefore, all MA plans are open for retroactive enrollments for these types of enrollment requests. No retroactive enrollments may be made unless the individual certifies that the MA organization (or EGHP) provided him/her with the explanation of enrollee rights (including the lock -in requirement) at the time of enrollment. The MA organization should submit such enrollments using the appropriate transaction code . Refer to the Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plan Communications User Guide (PCUG) for more information. The ability to submit limite d EGHP retroactive enrollment transactions is to be used only for the purpose of submitting a retroactive enrollment into an EGHP made necessary due to the employer's delay in forwarding the completed enrollment request to the MA organization. 60.6.2 - EGHP Retroactive Disenrollments The MA organization must submit a retroactive disenrollment request to CMS (or its designee) if an EGHP does not provide the MA organization with timely notification of a member's requested disenrollment. Up to 90 day's retr oactive payment adjustment is possible in such a case to conform to the adjustments in payment described under 42 CFR 422.308(f)(2) . The EGHP notification is considered untimely if it does not result in a disenrollment effective date as outlined in \u00a730.6. The MA organization must submit a disenrollment notice (i.e., documentation) to CMS (or its designee) demonstrating that the member acted to disenroll in a timely fashion (i.e., prospectively), but that the EGHP was late in providing the information to th e MA organization. Such documentation may include an enrollment form for a new MA plan signed by the member and given to the EGHP during an open enrollment season. The documentation may not include a copy of a Medicare supplemental plan or Medigap plan enr ollment form unless the member indicated on that form that he/she has canceled any other insurance. Such documentation should be sent to CMS (or its designee) as soon as possible. 60.7 - User Interface (UI) Transactions Reply Codes (TRC) - Communications with Beneficiaries Upon receipt of a CMS transaction reply, MA organizations must update their records to accurately reflect each i ndividual's enrollment status. Organizations are also required to provide certain notices 146 and information to beneficiaries w hen enrollment status is confirm ed or changes. In the case of UI - TRC replies, the standard operating procedures for providing these notices and/or information may not fit some of the unique situations many UI enrollment changes address. The table below provides guidelines for communicating with beneficiaries when enrollment changes are reported to MA organizations using the \"700 series\" TRCs that result from UI enrollment changes. In all cases, organizations will need to review the situations carefully to determine the necessity and appropriateness of sending notices. Some UI enrollment change processes will result in multiple 7 00- series TRCs being reported. Organizations must determine the final disposition of the beneficiary to ensure the correct mess age is provided in any notice sent. In complex situations, CMS encourages organizations to communicate directly (such as by telephone) with the beneficiary, in addition to any required notice or materials. When it is necessary to send a notice, organizatio ns must issue the notice within ten calendar days of receipt of the D TRR. TRC Beneficiary Communication Action 701 - New UI Enrollment Organizations may use existing confirmation notices as provided in CMS enrollment guidance. If such notice has already been provided with the same information, it is not necessary to provide it a second time. 702 - New UI Fill -in Enrollment Organizations must use Exhibit 30, \"Enrollment Status Update.\" Include the date range covered by the new fill -in period. 703 - UI En rollment Cancel If a cancellation notice applicable to this time period has already been provided, it is not necessary to provide it a second time. If notice has not been provided, organizations may use the existing cancellation of enrollment notice as pro vided in CMS enrollment guidance. If the specific situation warrants, organizations may use Exhibit 30 instead, providing information that clearly indicates that the enrollment period in question has been cancelled. Include information about the refunding of plan premiums, if applicable. 704 - UI Enrollment Cancel - PBP Change If the UI action is a correction to a plan submission error, the organization may have already provided the correct plan (PBP) information; if that's the case, it is not necessary to send it a second time. If the beneficiary has not received information about the specific plan (PBP), the organization must send the materials required in CMS enrollment guidance that would be provided for any new enrollment. Organizations must also send Exhibit 30 describing the plan change, including the effective date. The impact of the change on plan premiums, cost sharing, and provider networks must be communicated clearly. It is not necessary to confirm with a notice the associated \"enrollment cance led\" TRC that will accompany the enrollment into the new plan (PBP). 705 - New UI Enrollment - PBP Change Follow the guidance provided above for TRC 704. 706 - UI Enrollment Cancel - Segment change Plan (PBP) segment changes apply only to MA plans. Provi de updated materials reflecting the new elements of the changed segment, such as premium and cost sharing increases or decreases. 707- UI New enrollment - Segment Change Follow the guidance above for TRC 706. 147 708 - UI End Date Assigned This UI action ha s the same effect as a plan submitted disenrollment (code 51) transaction. Generally, organizations should follow existing CMS enrollment guidance for providing notice and confirmation of the disenrollment. However, since many UI initiated changes are retroactive, organizations may have already provided notice (with correct effective dates) and if so, need not provide it a second time. Additional clarification may be appropriate depending on the specifics of the case. 709 - UI Earlier Start Date An existin g enrollment period in the plan has changed to start earlier than previously recorded. If the organization has already provided notice reflecting this effective date of enrollment, it is not necessary to provide it a second time. When the individual has not already received notice reflecting this effective date, organizations may use existing confirmation of enrollment notices where there is confidence that such notice will not cause undue confusion. Alternatively, organizations may use Exhibit 30, includ ing in it the new effective date and information about additional premium liability (ensure flexibility in allowing payment arrangements where necessary). Organizations must also ensure individuals are fully aware of how to access coverage of services for the new time period, including their right to appeal. 710 - UI Later Start Date An existing enrollment period start date has been changed to start on a later date. Organizations must use Exhibit 30. Organizations must explain the change in the effective d ate of coverage, and provide information on the refunding of any premiums paid. Organizations must also explain the impact on any paid claims from the time period affected. 711 - UI Earlier End Date An enrollment period end date has been changed to occur earlier. Organizations must use Exhibit 30. Organizations must explain the change in the effective date of the end of coverage, and provide information on the refunding of any premiums paid. Organizations must also explain the impact on any paid claims fr om the time period affected. 712 - UI Later End Date An enrollment period end date has been changed to occur later. Organizations must use Exhibit 30. Organizations must explain the change in the effective date of the end of coverage, and provide information on any premiums the individual may owe for the extended period. Organizations must also ensure beneficiaries are fully aware of how to access coverage of services for the new time period. 713 - UI Removed End Date An enrollment period that pre viously had an end date is now open (and ongoing). Organizations must use Exhibit 25a to explain the change and that enrollment in the plan is now continuous. Organizations must provide information on any plan premiums and ensure beneficiaries are fully aw are of how to access coverage of services for the new time period and going forward. 148 60.8 - Election of Continuation of Enrollment Option for MA Local Plans 42 CFR 422.54(b) When a member permanently moves into the MA organization's continuation area, t he member must make a positive choice to continue enrollment in the MA local plan. The member does not have to complete and sign a new enrollment form in order for the continuation to occur but must make this choice in a manner described in the MA organiza tion's policy and procedure documents. The MA organization must verify that the member has established permanent residence in the continuation area. Proof of permanent residence is normally established by the address of the residence, but the MA organizat ion may request additional information such as voter's registration records, driver's license records, tax records, and utility bills. Such records must establish the permanent residence address, and not the mailing address, of the individual. The effecti ve date of a continuation of enrollment change generally is the first day of the month after the individual moves into the continuation area. 60.9 - Storage of Enrollment and Disenrollment Records As stated at 42 CFR 422.60(c)(2), MA organizations are required to file and retain enrollment request forms. MA organizations must retain and have available for evaluation enrollment and disenrollment records for the current contract period and ten (10) prior years (42 CFR 422.504(e)(4)). It is appropriate to allow for storage on microfilm, as long as microfilm versions of enrollment forms and disenrollment requests showing the signature and the date are available to reviewers. Similarly, other technologies that would allow the reviewer to access signed forms and other enrollment requests may also be allowed, such as optically scanned forms stored on disk. Records of MA enrollment and disenrollment requests made by any other enrollment request mechanism (as described in \u00a740.1) must also be retained as above. 149 Appendices Summary of Medicare Advantage Notice and Data Element Requirements 150 Appendix 1: Summary of Notice Requirements Referenced in sections: 10, 30, 40, 50, and 60 (Rev. 1, Issued: July 31, 2018; Effective/Implementation: 01 -01-2019) This Exhibit is intended to be a summary of notice requirements.

For use of simplified enrollment mechanism, the plan must be able to obtain, from its internal data sharing, all the required elements that it does not include on the enrollment request. Elements required on the simplified enrollment mechanism, regardless of d ata sharing, are marked with an asterisk (*). Data Element CMS requires Field on enrollment mechanism? Beneficiary response required on request?

For paper enrollment forms submitted without a signature, organization may verify with the applicant by telephone and document the contact i nstead of returning form. 17 As explained in \u00a740.2, the beneficiary and/or legal representative should write the date s/he signed the enrollment form; however, if s/he inadvertently fails to include the date on the enrollment form, then the stamped date of receipt that the MA organization places on the enrollment form may serve as the signature date of the form. Therefore, the signature date is not a necessary element. For employer group MA elections as described in \u00a740.4.1, the \"signature date\" is the date the employer's process was completed as recorded. 158 Data Element CMS requires Field on enrollment mechanism?

The application date is always a date prior to the effective date of enrollment. For use of simplified enrollment mechanism, follow the information based on how the enrollment request is received (e.g., paper, fax, telephone, electronically .)

For exact detail on the criteria and requirements for g ood cause reinstatements, see \u00a760.3. In all these examples, the individual is disenrolled for nonpayment of plan premiums and makes a timely request for good cause reinstatement. Favorable determination examples: Example A: Ms. Grey was disenrolled on May 31, 2015 following a plan's two month grace period. She states that she has a caregiver who is responsible for making her premium payments to the plan. Ms. Grey attests that her caregiver caught pneumonia, was hospitalized f or over 2 months from late March to late May 2015 and wasn't able to make payments. The plan issues a favorable good cause determination, since the member's caregiver was unexpectedly ill and hospitalized for a significant portion of the plan's grace perio d, which prevented the caregiver from making ar rangements for timely payment. The plan's favorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The credible statement was provided about a serious illness and the person paying premiums was hospitalized for a si gnificant portion of the plan's grace period; 2) The event (illness and hospitalization) was unexpected and out of the person's control; and 3) It is reasonable to conclude that the caregiver could not have paid or made arrangements to pay the owed premium s within the plan's grace period as a result of the illness and hospitalization. Example B: Mr. Lieber was disenrolled on April 30, 2015 following a plan's two mon th grace period. He states that he was in a car accident in mid -February, was hospitalized for one month and then sent to an assisted living facility for rehabilitation for one month. He indicated that he wasn't able to pay his bills during that time and didn't have any family to assist him. Because Mr. Lieber's situation was unexpected and he w as hospitalized and institutionalized for a significant portion of the plan's grace period, the plan issues a favorable good cause determination. The plan's favorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The creditable statement was provided about a se rious illness and that the member was hospitalized and institutionalized for significant portion of the plan's grace period ; 2) The event (illness and hospitalization) was unexpected and out of the person's control; and 3) It is reasonable to conclude tha t Mr. Lieber could not have paid or made arrangements to pay the owed premiums within the plan's grace period as a result of the illness. Example C: Ms. Kim was disenrolled on August 31, 2015 following the plan's two month grace period. She states that she was displaced from her apartment due to a building fire in early June, was unable to access her belongings and as a result, was unable to make timely payment. The plan issues a favorable determination because Ms. Kim's home was significantly damaged by an unexpected and uncontrollable event during the plan's grace period. The plan's favorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The creditable statement was provided about that the member's home was severely damaged due to an unexpected event; 2) The event (fire) was unexpected and out of the person's control; and 3) It is reasonable that the damage to Ms. Kim's home impaired her ability to pay or make arrangements to pay the owed premiums within the plan's grace period. 161 Example D: Mr. Jones was dise nrolled on June 30, 2015 following a plan's two month grace period. His son states that he found out that his father lost his coverage when he recently visited him. The son states that Mr. Jones was recently diagnosed with dementia and his condition is quickly worsening, which caused him to not pay his premiums. The son states that because of his father's condition, he is taking over financial matters for his fathe r and will pay the arrearages. The plan issues a favorable determination because Mr. Jones w as newly diagnosed with a serious illness that directly impacts his ability to pay his premiums. The plan's favorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The creditable statement was provided about a serious and prolonged illness with rapid deteriorat ion, that directly impacted the member's ability to pay premiums timely; 2) The event (serious illness with rapid deterioration) was unexpected and out of the person's control; and 3) It is reasonable to conclude that the onset of dementia caused Mr. Jones to fail to make the timely payment during the grace period. Example E: Ms. Brown was disenrolled on July 31, 2015 following the plan's three month grace period. She states that for the past four months, her husband was receiving intensive treatment for cancer and she was taking care of him during this time. During this time, she fell behind in paying bi lls due to the care he needed. The plan issues a favorable determination because Ms. Brown's husband was seriously ill for a prolonged period time during the plan's grace period. The plan's favorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The credible statement was provided about a serious and prolonged illness of an immediate family member; 2) The event (serious and prolonged illness) was unexpected and out of the person's control; and 3) It is reasonable to conclude that Ms. Brown's circumstance in providing caregiver services for her spouse impacted her ability to pay or make arrangements to pay the owed premiums within the plan's grace period. Example F: Mrs. Duke was disenrolled on August 31, 2015 following the plan's two month grace period. She states that her husband had been handling her bills and making payments timely. However, he passed away in July 2015, leaving her with no caregiver or family member to take over the responsibility. The plan issues a favorable good cause determination because of the recent death of Mrs. Duke's husband, which was unex pected and out of her control. The plan also offers Mrs. Duke the option to set up electronic payments and premium withholding to help ensure that she remains current in paying her premiums. The plan's favorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The credible statement was provided about the recent death of a spouse; 2) The event (death of spous e) was unexpected and out of the person's control; and 3) It is reasonable to conclude that the unexpected death impacted Mrs. Duke's ability to pay or make arrangements to pay the owed premiums within the plan's grace period. Example G: Mr. Santiago live s in Lucas County, Iowa, and was disenrolled on July 31, 2015 following the plan's two month grace period. He states that there were severe storms and significant flooding in his town and the Post Office closed for a week during the grace peri od while the flooding receded. The plan checks the FEMA.gov website and verifies that Lucas County, Iowa, was declar ed as a federal disaster area. The plan issues a favorable good cause determination because the declared federal state of emergency occurred during the plan's grace period and that emergency impacted Mr. Santiago's ability to pay his premiums timely. The plan's favorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The credible statement provided was an extreme weather -related event The event (declared state of emergency) was unexpected and out of the person's control; 2) The event was unexpected and out of the person's control; and 3) It is 162 reasonable to conclude that this circumstance impacted Mr. Santiago's ability to pay or make arrangements to pay the owe d premiums within the plan's grace period. Unfavorable determination examples: Example A: Mr. Smith was disenrolled on June 30, 2015 following the plan's three month grace period. He states that he was unable to pay his plan premiums because he was in th e hospital for a week in May for a planned surgical procedure, followed by a two week stay in a rehabilitation facility. The plan issues an unfavorable good cause determination because Mr. Smith was not unexpectedly hospitalized or institutionalized for a significant porti on of the plan's grace period. Even though Mr. Smith was away from his home undergoing medical treatment for three weeks, he had a reasonable opportunity and ability to resolve the delinquency w ithin the plan's grace period. The plan's unf avorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The credible statement provided was not one in which hospitalization or institutionalization occurred for a significant portion of the plan's grace period; 2) The situation (planned hospital procedure) was not unexpected, nor did it render the individual without control over timely payment of his premiums; and 3) It is reasonable to expect that Mr. Smith could have paid or made arrangements to pay the owed amounts within the plan's grace period. Mr. Smith m ay not be reinstated for good cause. Example B: Mr. Jones was disenrolled on May 31, 2015 following the plan's two month grace period. He states that he was unable to pay his plan premiums because he has End -Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and goes to a facili ty fo r dialysis three times a week. Mr. Jones states that he sometimes has difficulty keeping track of his monthly premium billing statements because of his frequent t rips to the dialysis facility. The plan issues an unfavorable good cause determination because Mr. Jones has a known health issue and his need for routine dialysis is not unexpected in any way. While he has a chronic illness, he was receiving regular care to treat his condition, and it is reasonable to expect him, or someone acting on his beha lf, to resolve the delinquency at some point during the plan's grace period. The plan's unfavorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The credible statement provided was not one in which a chronic illness had newly developed serious complications which inhibited the ability to pay premiums timely; 2) The situation (chronic condition with no complications) did not render the individual without control over timely payment of his premiums; and 3) It is reasonable to expect that Mr. Jones could have paid or made arrangements to pay the owed amounts w ithin the plan's grace period. Mr. Jones may not be reinstated for good cause. Example C: Ms. Ferrera was disenrolled on March 31, 2015 following the plan's two month grace period. She states that she and h er family were away from home on an extended vacation and she wasn't aware that she had been disenrolled until they returned home. Ms. Ferrera states that she is willing and able to pay the plan premiums that were not paid and added that she needs her cov erage due to her many medications for diabetes. The plan issues an unfavorable good cause determination because Ms. Ferrera did not have a circumstance that was unexpe cted or unforeseen in any way. While she has a chronic illness and requires medicines to treat her condition, Ms. Ferrera had the ability to make arrangements to have the premiums paid on t ime while she was out of town. The plan's unfavorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The credible statement provided of being away from home on va cation is listed specifically as the basis for an unfavorable determination; 2) The situation (planned vacation) was not unexpected in any way; and 3) It is reasonable to expect that Ms. Ferrera could have paid or made 163 arrangements to pay the owed amounts within the plan's grace period. Ms. Ferrera may not be reinstated for good cause. Example D: Mr. Davis was disenrolled on July 31, 2015 following the plan's two month grace period. He states that earlier in the year he moved a short distance from his pre vious residence but did not infor m the plan of his new address. The plan issues an unfavorable good cause determination because the plan materials clearly state that it is the enrollee's responsibility to inform th e plan of a change of address. This is not a case of plan error, since the plan sent the monthly billing statements and the disenrollment notice to the address most recently provided by Mr. Davis. (See \u00a760.3.3 for information o n reinstatement following dis enrollment due to plan error.) The plan's unfavorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The credible statement provided of an unreported change of address is listed specifically as the basis for an unfavorable determination; 2) The situation (permanent residence change) was not unexpected i n any way; and 3) It is reasonable to expect Mr. Davis to inform the plan of his new address, to avoid any delay in his receipt of important materials, such as monthly billing statements and notices regarding his enrollment status. Mr. Davis may not be rei nstated for good cause. Example E: Ms. Adams was disenrolled on April 30, 2015 following the pl an's three month grace period. She states that the basement in her home and her electricity were affected by recent flooding and that this prevented her from s ending her monthly plan premium payments. Local road closures and power outages lasted for up to a week for some residents. The plan issues an unfavorable good cause determination because the local storms and subsequent flooding did not severely damage Ms. Adams home or prevent her from making the premium payments; further, there was neither a state nor federal disaster declaration. The plan's unfavorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The credible statement provided was not one in which the home was severely damaged nor was there a federal or state declaration of emergency; and 2) While road closures and power outages impacted some area residents, it isn't clear that Ms. Adams was directly impacted by these events or was impeded from being able to make timely payment; and 3) It is reasonable to expect that Ms. Adams could have paid or made arrangements to pay the owed amounts within the plan's grace period. Ms. Adams may not be reinstated for good cause . Example F: Mrs. Johnson was disenrolled on March 31, 2015 following the plan's two month grace period. She states that her husband is responsible for making her premium payments t o the plan. Mrs. Johnson attests that her husband became ill, was hospitalized for two w eeks in February 2015 and was not able to make payments. The plan issues an unfavorable good cause determination since, although her husband's illness was unexpected, he was not hospitalized for a significant portion of the plan's grace period, which would have caused him to be unable to make t he payment in a timely manner. The plan's unfavorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The credible statement provided was not that hospitalization or institutionalization occurred for a significant portion of the plan's grace period; and 2) It is reasonable to expect that Mr. Johnson could have paid or made arrangements to pay the owed amounts for this wife's coverage within the plan's grace period. Mrs. Johnson may not be reinstated for good cause. Example G : Mr. Patel was disenrolled on September 30, 2015 following the plan's three month grace period. He states that his income decreased and he was unable to afford to pay his premiums. The plan issues an unfavorable good cause determination because there wasn 't an unexpected or unforeseen circumstance that prevented payment from being made by Mr. Patel in a timely manner. The plan's unfavorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The credible statement provided of personal financial issues is listed speci fically as the basis for an 164 unfavorable determination; and 2) It is reasonable to expect that Mr. Patel could have paid or made arrangements to pay the owed amounts w ithin the plan's grace period. Mr. Patel may not be reinstated for good cause. Example H: Ms. Ulman was disenrolled on June 30, 2015 following the plan's two month grace period. She states that she needs to refill her medications and that she paid her owed amounts to the plan on July 20, 2015, following her disenrollment effective date. The p lan issues an unfavorable good cause determination because Ms. Ulman's need for medications did not inhibit her ability to pay her premiums timely. The plan's unfavorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The situation (medication needs) was not unexpected or out of the person's control, nor did it impede her ability to pay timely; and 2) It is reasonable to expect that Ms. Ulman could have paid or made arrangements to pay the owed amounts within the plan's grace period. Ms. Ulman may not be reinstat ed for good cause. Example I: Ms. Taylor was disenrolled on March 31, 2015 following a pl an's three month grace period. She states that when she enrolled in the plan during the fall open enrollment period, she selected premium withhold as the method of premium payment. She says that she received a premium bill from the new plan for January and, in addition, received a delinquency notice in early January warning of disenrollment at the end of March if she did not pay the premium for January. She stated th at she ignored the bill and the delinquency notice, assuming that her plan premiums were being withheld from her Social Security benefit check starting with the January premium. The plan issues an unfavorable good cause determination because the plan expl ained in its letter to Ms. Taylor following submission of the enrollment transaction and receipt of the DTRR that her first month's plan premium was not withheld, that she was responsible for paying her premiums until premium withholding started and that s he could be involuntarily disenrolled. The plan concluded that Ms. Taylor had been appropriately advised of her obligation to pay the bill for the January premium and that this was reiterated by means of the subsequent premium bills and the delinquency let ter th e plan sent to her in January. The plan's unfavorable determination is appropriate because: 1) The situation (misunderstanding of ramifications of nonpayment of premiums) was not unexpected in any way; 2) The situation did not impede her ability to p ay timely; and 3) It is reasonable to expect that Ms. Taylor could have paid or made arrangements to pay the owed amounts within the plan's grace period. Ms. Taylor may not be reinstated for good cause. 165 EXHIBITS Model Medicare Advantage Enrollment Forms & Notices This section contains model exhibits for plan issued notices to beneficiaries regarding enrollment matters.

I will need to keep my Medicare Parts A and B. I can be in only one Medicare Advantage plan at a time and I understand that my enrollment in this plan will automatically end my enrollment in another Medicare health plan. It is my responsibility to inform you of any health coverage that I have or may get in the future. I understand that if I don't have Medicare prescription drug coverage, or creditable (as applicable) > 173 prescription drug coverage (as good as Medicare's), I may have to pay a late enrollment penalty if I enroll in Medicare prescription drug coverage in the future. Enrollment in this plan is generally for the entire year. I may leave this plan (\"disenroll\") during the Annual Enrollment Period that is October 15th through December 7th of every year (effective the following January 1st) or under certain limited special circumstances, by sending a request in writing to <MSA plan name>. If I choose a Medicare MSA plan and haven't before joined an MSA plan, then change my mind, I may cancel my enrollment by December 15 of the same year by contacting my plan to cancel my enrollment request. I understand that my enrollment into an MSA plan isn't complete until the bank account is established.

Withdrawals made from the MSA bank account aren't taxed when used for IRS -qualified medical expenses. I would owe income tax and up to a 50% pena lty for withdrawals used for non -medical expenses. After the deductible is met the plan pays 100% of Medicare -covered services. [MSA Demonstration Plans insert : If I am enrolling in a MSA demonstration plan, I may be responsible for cost sharing for ce rtain preventive services, as described by the plan, before the deductible is met. After the deductible is met, I may be responsible for cost -sharing until my expenses for covered services reach the out -of-pocket maximum, after which the MSA demonstration plan pays 100% of Medicare covered services.] If I have any questions regarding the initial set -up of my MSA bank account or any of the information in this enrollment form, I should contact the <plan name> at < contact number>. <MSA plan name> serves a specific service area. If I move out of the area that <MSA Plan Name> serves, I need to notify the plan so I can disenroll and find a new plan in my new area. Once I am a member of <MSA plan Name>, I have the right to appeal plan decisions about payment o r services if I disagree. I will read the [insert either Member Handbook or Evidence of Coverage document] from <MSA plan name> when I get it to know which rules I must follow to get coverage with this Medicare Advantage plan. I understand that if I am getting assistance from a sales agent, broker, or other individual employed by or contracted with <plan name>, he/she may be paid based on my enrollment in<plan name>. I understand that if I disenroll before the end of the plan year (December 31st), <pla n name> may debit my MSA bank account for a prorated share of the current year's deposit to be returned to Medicare. The debit amount is based on the number of months left in the year after the disenrollment date. I understand that, if I die, my estate w ill be responsible for any money owed to Medicare.
