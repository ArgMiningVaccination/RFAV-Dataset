Effective Date of an Eligible Employee's or Dependent's Insurance The Effective Date of an employee's or Dependent's insurance will be the date the person becomes covered by Health Plan as a Point -of-Service Member. Eligibility of an Eligible Employee's Dependent See the Definition section for the definition of a Dependent. Age Limits for Depende nt Children The a ge limit for Dependent children is under 26 years.

The De pendent child must be of an age within the Student Age Limit as shown in your Schedule of Coverage. A \"full-time student\" is a Depend ent child who is en rolled at a high sch ool, college, un iversity , techni cal school, trade school , or vocational school on a full-time ba sis. A \"full time student \" may also include, those who ar e on m edical leave of abse nce from the school or th ose who have any other change in enrollm ent in school) due to a M ed ically Necess ary condition as ce rtified by the attendi Physici an.

Excepti ons The Dependent Age Limit for Dependent Children d oes n ot apply to a Dependent child who is unma rried and continu es to be both: 1) physically or mentally disabl ed and 2) depe ndent upon You fo r suppor t and maintenance. Such child will continue to qualif y as a Dependent until the earlie r of the following dates: a) the date the child recovers from the phys ically or mentally disabl ing si ckness, injury or condition; or b) the date the child no longer depends on You for support and maint enance. The a bove ex ception also appli es to a \"full time student\" who is on m edical leave of absence a s descr ibed above, if, as a resul t of the natur e of the sickness, injury, or condition, would render the dependent child physically or mentally disab led and dependent upon You for support and maintena nce. Proof of such i ncap acity and dependency must be submitted to KPIC within 60 days of Your re ceipt of KPIC' s notic e of the child's attainment of the limiting age and subseque ntly as may be required by KPIC, but not more frequ ently than a two-year pe riod th e limiting age. IMPOR TANT: KPIC will not deny enroll ment of a child under the hea lth insurance coverage of a child's parent beca use: 1. The child was born out of wedlock; 2. The child is not claimed as a Depe ndent on the parent's federal in come tax return ; or 3. The child does not reside with the parent or in an applicable service area. Eligibility Date of Dependents A Dependent's eligibility date is the later of: (a) Your eligibility date; or (b) the date the person qualifies as Your Dependent. A child named in a Qualified Medical Child Support Order qualifies as Your Dependent SAMPLEELIGIBILITY KPIC -GC-3TPOS - LG-2023- CO-NGF 5 2023 on the date specified in the court order. An adopted child qualifies as Your Dependent on the earlier of the date of adoption or the date of Placement for Adoption. Enrollment Rules for Eligible Employee or Dependent If you are an Eligible Employee, your and your Dependent's effective date of insurance is determined by the Enrollment Rules that follow. 1. Initial Open Enrollment The Policyholder will offer an initial open enrollment to new Eligible Employees and Dependents when the Employee is first eligible for coverage. Effective date. I nitial enrollment for newly Eligible Employees and Dependents is effective following completion of any waiting period (not to exceed 90 days), if required by the Policyholder. In the absence of a waiting period, the enrollment becomes effective according to the eligibility rules established by the Policyholder. If You did not enroll Yourself and/or Your Dependents during the initial enrollment period, You will need t o wait until the next annual open enrollment period to enroll or during the special enrollment period as described below. 2. Annual Open Enrollment Annual open enrollment refers to a standardized annual period of time, of no less than 30 days prior to the completion of the employer's plan year for Eligible Employees and Dependents to enroll. During the annual open enrollment period, Eligible Employees and Dependents can apply for or change coverage by submitting an enrollment application to your Group during the annual open enrollment period. Effective date. Enrollment is effective on the first day following the end of the prior plan year. Annual open enrollment occurs only once every year. The Policyholder will notify You when the annual open enrollment is available in advance of such period. Your Group will let you know when the annual open enrollment period begins and ends and the effective date. 3. S pecial Enrollment You or your Dependent may experience a qualifying event that allows a change in your enrollment. Examples of qualifying events are the loss of coverage, a Dependent's aging off this plan, marriage, and birth of a child. The qualifying event results in a special enrollment period that usually (but not always) starts on the date of the qualifying event and lasts for sixty (60) days. During the special enrollment period, you may enroll your Dependent(s) in this plan or, in certain circumstances, you may change plans (your plan choice may be limited). There are requirements that you must meet to take advantage of a special enrollment period including showing proof of your own or your Dependent's qualifying event. To learn more about qualifying events, special enrollment periods, how to enroll or change your plan (if permitted), timeframes for submitting information to Kaiser Permanente and other requirements, call Member Services at 1-855-364-3184. Effective Date. I n the case of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, or placement in foster care, enrollment is effective on the date of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption or placement in foster care. In the case of any other qualifying event listed above, including marriage, civil union, or loss of c overage, enrollment is effective on the first day of the following month after We receive a fully completed enrollment form. If You have Dependent coverage and there would be no extra cost for adding a Dependent to Your coverage, the effective date of insurance for a Dependent will be the date You acquire the Dependent. You must notify KPIC that You have a new Dependent within 31 days so that the Dependent can be added to Your coverage. This will also help avoid delays on any claim You might file on behalf of the Dependent. SAMPLEELIGIBILITY KPIC -GC-3TPOS - LG-2023- CO-NGF 6 2023 If the cost of Your Dependent coverage would increase when You add a Dependent, You must enroll the Dependent for insurance and agree to pay any additional cost in accordance with the Enrollment Rules. The effective date of insurance for that Dependent will be the date determined from the Enrollment Rules. If a Dependent does not enroll when eligible during the special enrollment period he/she may be excluded from all coverage until the next Annual Open Enrollment Period. Court or Administrative Ordered Coverage for a Dependent Child If a Covered Person is a non-cu stodial parent and is required by an Order to pr ovide health coverage for an eligible ch ild and th e Covered Pe rson is eligible for coverage un der a famil y plan, the Covered Person, employee, e mployer or group administrato r may en roll the eligible child under family coverage by send ing KPIC a written application and paying KPIC any a dditional amounts due as a result of the change in coverage. Enrollment period restrictions will n ot apply in these ci rcumstances. However, the child s hould be enrolled within 31 days of the cou rt or ad minis trative or der to av oid any delay s in t he proce ssing of any claim that m ay be submitted on behal f of the child. Coverage will not commence until the enrollment process has been comp leted.

Enrollment period restrictions will not apply in these ci rcumstances. Ho wever, the child must be enro lled within 31 days of the O rder to avoid any delays in the processi ng of any claim that may be su bmitted on behalf of the child. The coverage for any child enrol led un der this provision will continue pu rsuant to the terms of this health insurance plan unless KPIC is provide d written evidence that: 1. The Order is no longer in effect; 2. The child is or will be enrol led in comparable health coverage through another insurer which will take effec t on or befor e the requested termi nation date of the child's coverage under the Group Policy; 3.

SAMPLE KPIC -GC-3TPOS -LG-2023- CO-NGF 8 2023 HOW TO ACCES S YOU R SERVICE S AND OBTAIN APPROVAL OF BENEFITS This section descr ibes how to access y our services and how to obtain ap proval of certain b enefits that are subject to Pre-certificati on. Please read the following information carefully. It will help You understand how prior authorization requirements and the provider You select can affect the dollar amount You must pay in connection with receiving Covered Services. Under this Point of Service Plan, a Covered Person has access to three (3) tiers of coverage. The level of cover age that is applied to a Covered Service is dependent upon the provider's participating status and prior authorization requirements. Your provider and your provider's adherence to prior authorization requirements pursuant to state law affect whether the H MO Provider or the Participating Provider or Non - Participating Provider tiers of coverage applies to a Covered Service. HMO T ier (Health Plan) Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Colorado (hereafter referred to as \"Health Plan\") provides the HMO coverage, which includes specified medical and Hospital services provided, prescribed, or directed by a Medical Group Physician, Affiliated Physicians and other Plan Providers (hereafter referred to as \"Plan Providers\") as these terms are defined in the Health Plan Evidence of Coverage. HMO services also include Emergency Care received from non- Plan Providers. These services rendered by Plan Providers are set forth in the Health Plan Evidence of Coverage issued to you separately. When a Plan Provider renders a Covered Service and the Health Plan's prior authorization rules are met, the service will be covered under the HMO Tier. Typically, benefits payable under the Health Plan Evidence of Coverage are greater for Covered Services received from Plan P roviders than those benefits payable for Covered Services received from Participating Providers and Non- Participating Providers. Participating Provider Tier and Non -P articipating Provider Tier (KPIC) Kaiser Permanente Insurance Company (KPIC) provides the Participating Provider and Non -Participating Provider benefit tiers of Your coverage. As reflected in Your SCHEDULE OF BENEFITS (Who Pays What) section, Your coverage also includes Covered Services received from Participating Providers as well as Non- Particip ating Providers. Generally, benefits payable under the Group Policy are greater for Covered Services received from Participating Providers than those benefits payable for Covered Services received from Non -Participating Providers. In order for benefits to be payable at the Participating Provider level under the Participating Provider Tier, the Covered Person must receive care from a Participating Provider. To verify the current participation status of a provider, please call the toll -free number listed in the Participating Provider directory. A current copy of KPIC's Participating Provider directory is available from Your employer, or you may call the phone number listed on Your ID card or You may visit website at https://choiceproducts -colorado.kaiserpermanente.org/3- tier-point -of-service receives care fr om a Non -Participating Provider, benefits under the Group Policy will be payable at the Non -Participating Provider level under the Non- Participating Provider Tier. However, if there are no Participating Providers within a reasonable distance per state regulation to provide a covered benefit, and as a result services are provided by a Non -Participating Provider, then the service will be covered at the Participating Provider level. Please notify us by calling Customer Service at 1-855-364-3184 if you are unable to locate a Participating Provider for a covered benefit. In addition to higher Deductibles, Coinsurance or Copayments, a Non- Participating Provider may balance bill you. Balance billing occurs when a Non- Participating Provider bills you for the difference between the billed amount and Maximum Allowable Charge. Non- Participating Providers rendering services in Colorado are not allowed to balance bill You according to state and federal law : When You receive Emergency services in a Non-Participating facility or when Emergency services are rendered by physicians and other professionals that are Non- Participating Providers. This includes services You may get after You are in stable condition unless You give written consent and SAMPLEHOW TO ACCES S YOU R SERVICE S AND OBTAIN APPROVAL OF BENEFITS KPIC -GC-3TPOS - LG-2023- CO-NGF 9 2023 give up Your protections not to be balanced billed for these post -stabilization services. When you receive Non- Emergency Services rendered in Participating facilities by physicians and other professionals that are Non- Participating Providers . unless You give written consent and give up Your protections. When Y ou receive Emergency Ambulance Services from ambulance service providers that are private companies (not publicly funded). When You receive Air Ambulance Services subject to federal law. When balance billing is not allowed, You are only responsible for paying Your share of the cost (like the copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles that You would pay if the provider or facility was a Participating Provider or facility). KPIC will count any amount You pay for Emergency Services or Non- Participating Provider services toward your Deductible and Out -of-Pocket Maximum KPIC will pay Non- Participating Providers and facilities directly. IMPORTANT NOTE: If a Covered Service is provided, arranged, paid for or payable by the Health Plan, no payment will be made by KPIC. Payments will be made by either Health Plan or KPIC but not both. The benefits provided by Health Plan under the HMO Tier and by KPIC under the Participating Provider and Non -Participating Provider Tiers are not the same. Some services are covered by both Health Plan and KPIC, and others are covered only by Health Plan or KPIC. In cases where a provider is contracted with both Health Plan and KPIC and the Health Plan's prior authorization requirements are met , pursuant to state law, the HMO level of coverage is applied to the treatment and services. If the Covered Service is not payable under the HMO coverage, it may be considered for payment under the Participating Provider level . Neither Health Plan nor KPIC is responsible for any Covered Person's decision to receive treatment, services or supplies by HMO Providers (Plan Provi ders) or by Participating Providers and Non - Participating Providers . Neither Health Plan nor KPIC is liable for the qualifications of providers or treatment, services or supplies provided under the other party's coverage. KPIC is not liable for the qualifications of providers or treatment, services or supplies provided by Participating or Non -Participating Providers. For any questions regarding provider network participation please call Customer Service at 1-855-364- 3184 (Toll free) or 711 (TTY) Pre-certification through the Medical Review Program This s ub-se ction u nder the HO W TO ACCES S YOU R SERVI CES AND OBTAIN APPROVA L OF BENEFIT S section d escribes: 1.

The step therapy process encourages safe and cost -effective medication use. Under this process, a \"step\" approach is required to receive coverage for certain high- cost medications. Refer to the formulary for a complete list of medications requiring step therapy. This means that to receive coverage You may first need to try a proven, cost -effective medication before using a more costly medication. Treatment decisions are always between You and Your Prescribing Provider. Refer to the Formulary for a complete list of medications requiring step t herapy. The following outpatient prescription drugs shall not be subject to any Step Therapy requirement: (1) FDA -approved medication for the treatment of substance use disorder ; (2) FDA-approved medication for the treatment of S tage four (4) advanced met astatic cancer; and (3) FDA - approved medication for the prevention of HIV infection when prescribed and dispensed by a pharmacist.

Prior authorization reviews address clinical appropriateness, including genomic testing, safety issues, dosing restrictions and ongoing treatment criteria. If a drug requires prior authorization, Your Prescribing Provider must work with Us to authorize the drug for Your use. Drugs requiring Prior Authorization have specific clinical criteria that You must meet for the prescription to be eligible for coverage.

Completion of Covered Services by a Terminated Provider - For PPO Plans only If You are inpatient in a Hospital , Skilled Nursi ng Fa cility, or a hospice for Hospic e Care at the time of a Particip ating Provider 's termination, You will continue to receive c overage for C overed Services until Your date of discharge from such inpatient fa cility consistent with applicable Colorado law. As to services other than inpatient s ervices, We will advise You in writing as to the specific extension of time, under Colorado law, pertaining to the rendition of Covered Services by a terminated Participating Provider Coordi nation of Benefits Prov isions Application This Coordination of Benefits (\"CO B\") provis ion applies wh en the Covered Person has health care coverage und er more than one Plan. Plan is defined below. The order-of- benefi t determination ru les govern the order in which each Plan will pay a claim for benefits. The Plan that pays first is called the Primary plan. The Prim ary plan mu st pay benefits in ac cordan ce with its policy te rms without regard to the po ssibilit y that another Plan may cover some expenses. The Pl an that pays after the P rimary plan is the Se condary plan. The Second ary plan may reduce the benefits it pays so that payment s from all Plans do not exce ed 100% of the total Allowab le Expense. SAMPLEGENERAL POLICY PROVISIONS KPIC -GC-3TPOS - LG-2023- CO-NGF 43 2023 Definitions Related to Coordination of Benefits A. A \" plan\" is any of the following that provides benefit s or services for medical or d ental care or treatment. However, if separate contracts are u sed to provide coordinat ed coverage for members of a grou p, the separate cont racts are considered p arts of the same plan and there is no COB among those separate contrac ts. 1. \"Plan\" includes: group insurance contracts, organization (HMO) co ntracts, closed p anel plans or other forms of group or group-ty pe coverage (whet her insured o r uninsured); medical care compon ents of long-term ca re contracts, such as skilled nursing care; medical benefits under group o r individual automobil e contr acts; and M edicare or a ny other federal gover nmental plan, as pe rmitte d by law. 2. \" Plan\" does not include: hospital inde mnity cover age or other fixed indem nity coverage; accident only coverage ; specifie sp ecified accident covera ge; limite d benefit healt h cover age, as defined by state law; school accident type coverage; be nefits for non- medical compon ents of care policies; Medicare supplement policies; Medicaid polic ies; or coverage u nder other federal governm ental plans , unless permitted by law. Each contract for coverage under (1) or (2) is a separa te Plan. If a Plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Plan. B. This plan mean s, in a COB provis ion, the pa rt of the contract providing the he alth care benefits to which the COB provision appli es and which may be redu ced because of the benefits of other plans. Any other part of the contrac t providing healt h care b enefits is separate from this plan. A contract may apply one COB provis ion to certain benefits, such as dental b enefits , coordinating only with simila r benefits , and may apply another COB provision to coordinate other benefits. C. The o r der-of-benefit payment rules determine whether this plan is a \"P rimary plan\" or \"Seco ndary plan\" when compared to another plan co vering the p erson. When this plan is Pr imary, its benefits are determined before those of any other Plan and without considering any other Plan's be nefits. When this Plan is Second ary, its benefits are determined after those of another Plan and may be reduced beca use of the Prim ary plan's benefits , so t hat all Plan benefits do n ot exceed 10 0% of the total Allowab le expen se. D. Allowa ble Expense is a health care service or expen se, including D eductibles, Coinsurance and Copayments, that is covered at least in part by any Plan cover ing the pe rson. When a Plan provide s benefits in the form of services, the reasonable ca sh value of each service will be considered an Allowab le Expe nse and a benefi t paid. An expens e or service or portion of an expense that is not covered by any of the Pla ns covering the person is not an A llowable Expense. In addit ion, any expe nse that a pro vider by law or in accordan ce with a co ntractual agreement is proh ibited from charging a Covere d Perso n is not an Allowable Expe nse. The f ollowin g are example s of expense s that are not Allowabl e Expens es: 1. The difference between the cost of a semi- priva te hospital room and a private hospital room is not an Allow able Expense, unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private hospital room expense s. 2. If a Covere d Perso n is covered by two or more pl ans that compute their benefit payment s on the basis of usual and cu stoma ry fees or relative value schedule reimbu rseme nt methodology or othe r similar reimbu rsement methodology, any am ount in exces s of the highest re imbursem ent amount for a specific benefit is not an Allow able Expense. 3. If a person is covered by two or more plans that provide be nefits or services on the ba sis of negotiat ed fees, an amount in exces s of the highest of the negotiat ed fees is n ot an Allow able Expense. 4. If a C overe d Perso n is covere d by one Plan that ca lculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and cu stom ary fees or relative value schedule reimb ursement methodology or other similar reimbursement methodol ogy and another Plan that pro vides its benefits or services on the ba sis of negotiated fees, the Primary plan's pa yment a rrang ement shall be the Allowa ble Expense fo r all SAMPLEGENERAL POLICY PROVISIONS KPIC -GC-3TPOS - LG-2023- CO-NGF 44 2023 Plans. However, if the provide r has contract ed with the Second ary plan to provide the benefit or service for a specific negotiated fee or payment amount that is different than the P rimary plan's payment arrangeme nt and if the provider's contract permits, the negotiated fee or payment shall be the Allow able Expense us ed by the S econdary plan to determi ne its benefits. 5. The amount of any benefit reduction by the Primary plan because a Covered Person has failed to comply with the Plan provisions is not an Allowable Expense. Examples of these types of plan provisions include second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions, and preferred provider arrangements. E. Claim determination pe riod is usua lly a calend ar year, but a plan may use some other period of time that fits the covera ge of the group co ntract . A person is covered by a plan during a portion of a claim determi nation pe riod if that person's coverag e starts or ends during the claim determ ination period. However, it does not include any part of a year du ring which a person has no cover age under this plan, or before the date this COB provis ion or a similar provision takes effect. F. C losed Pa nel Plan is a plan that provides health b enefits to Covered Persons primaril y in the form of services through a pa nel of provider s that have contr acted with either directly or indirectly or are employed by the Plan, and that limits or excludes benefit s for services provid ed by other providers, except in case s of emerge ncy or referr al by a panel membe r. G. Custodial parent means a pa rent awarded primary custody by a court decree. In the absence of a court decree, it is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year without regard to any tempor ary visitation. Order -of-Benefit Payment Rules When two or more plans p ay benefits, the rul es for determin ing the order of payment are as follows: A. The P rimary plan pays or provi des its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits under any other P lan. B. ( 1) Exce pt as provid ed in paragraph (2 ), a Plan that does not conta in a coordination of benefits provis ion that is consistent with this regulation is always Primary unles s the provis ions of both pla ns state th at the compl ying plan i s Primary. (2) Coverage that is obtai ned by virtue o f being me mbers i n a group , and d esigned to sup plement part of the basic pack age of benefits , may provid e supplementary coverage that shall be in exces s of any other parts of the plan provided by the contra ct holde r. Examples of these types of situations are m ajor medical coverages that are superimposed over base plan hospital and surgical bene fits, and insuranc e type coverages that are written in connection with a Closed Panel Plan to provide out -of-networ k benefits. C. A P lan may conside r the benefit s paid or provided by another Plan in determining its benefit s only whe n it is S econdar y to that other Plan. D. E ach Plan determines its order of benefits using t he first of the following rul es that apply: (1) Non- Dependent or Dependent . The Plan that co vers the pe rson other than as a as an empl oyee, membe r, subscrib er or retiree is the Primary plan and the Plan that covers the Covered Pe rson as a de pende nt is the Seco ndary plan. However, if the Cover ed Person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicar e is S econdar y to the Plan covering the person as a dependent ; and P rimar y to the Plan coverin g the Covered Pe rson as other than a depende nt (e.g. a retired em ployee); then the order o f benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan coverin g the Covered Perso n as an employ ee, member, subscrib er or retiree is the Secondary plan and the other Plan is the Pr imary plan. (2) Depe ndent Child Covered Under M ore Than One Plan. Unles s there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a dependent child is covered by m ore than one Plan the order of benefits is determined a s follows: a) For a de p endent child whose pare nts are m arried or are living togethe r, whet her or not they have ever been married: i) The Plan of the par ent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the prima ry plan; SAMPLEGENERAL POLICY PROVISIONS KPIC -GC-3TPOS - LG-2023- CO-NGF 45 2023 or ii) If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary plan. b) For a de pend ent child whose pare nts are divorce d or separate d or not living together, whether or not they have ever been ma rried: i) If a court decree states that one of the pa rents is responsible for the de pendent child's health care expenses or health care coverag e and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is Primary. This rule applies to plan years com mencing after the Plan is given notic e of the court decree; ii) If a co urt decree states that both parents a re responsible for the depende nt child's health care expenses or health ca re coverag e, the provisions of Subp aragraph (a) above shall determi ne the order of benefits; iii) If a c our t decree states t hat the parent s have joint custody without specifyin g that one parent has respon sibilit y for the healt h care expe nses or health ca re coverage of the depe ndent child, the provisions of Subparagraph (a) above shall d etermi ne the order of benefits ; or iv) If there is no court decree allocating respon sibility for the depe ndent child's health care expenses or health care cove rage, the o rder of benefits for the chi ld are as follow s: The Plan coverin g the custodial pa rent; The Plan coverin g the spous e of the custodia l paren t; The P lan covering the non- custodial p arent; and th en The P lan covering the sp ouse of the non-cu stodial parent. c) For a dep ende nt child covered under more th an one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the provisions of Subpar agraph (a) or (b) above shall determine the order of benef its as if those individuals were the par ents of the chil d. (3) Act ive Employee or Retired or Laid-off Employee. The Plan that covers a pe rson as an active employee, that is, an employ ee who is neither laid off nor retired, is the Primary plan. The Plan covering that same Cover ed Person as a retired or laid-off employee is the Se condary plan. The same would hold true if a Covered Person is a de pende nt of an active employee and that same Covered Pe rson is a dep ende nt of a retired or laid-off employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a re sult, the Plans do not agree on the o rder of benefits, this rule is i gnored. This rule does no t apply if the rule labeled D( 1) can determi ne the ord er of benef its. (4) COBR A or State Continuatio n Coverage. If a Covered Perso n whose coverage is provided pursuant to COBRA or unde r a right of continuat ion provided by state or other federal law i s covered under another Plan, the Plan cover ing the person as an employe e, membe r, subscri ber or retiree or co vering the pe rson as a depend ent of an employee, me mber, subscribe r or retire e is the Primary plan and the COBRA or state or other federa l continuatio n coverag e is the Se cond ary plan. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result , the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits , this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule la beled D(1) can determine the order of benefits. (5) Lon ger or Shorter Length of Coverage. The Plan that cover ed the pe rson as an employee, me mber, policyholder , subscriber or retire e longer is the Primary plan and the Pla n that cover ed the p erson the sh orter period of time is the Se condary plan. (6) If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits, the Allow able Expenses sh all be shared equally between the Plans meeting the defini tion of Plan. In addition, this Plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the Primary plan. Effect on the Benefits of this Plan A. When this Plan is Secon dary, it may reduce its benefits so that the total benef its paid or provided by all Plans d uring a plan year are not more than the total Allowable Expenses. In determining the amount to be paid for any claim, the Se condary plan will calcu late the b enefits it would have paid in the ab sence SAMPLEGENERAL POLICY PROVISIONS KPIC -GC-3TPOS - LG-2023- CO-NGF 46 2023 of other healt h care coverage and apply that c alculated amount to any Allowable Expe nse under it s Plan that is unpai d by the Primary plan. The Secondar y plan may then reduce its payment by the amount so that, when co mbined with the amount paid by the Pr imary plan, the total benef its paid or provided by all Plans for the claim do not excee d the total Allowabl e Expens e for that claim . In addition, the Se condary pl an shall credit to its plan deductibl e any amount s it would have credited to its deductible in the absenc e of other healt h care coverage. B. If a Cover ed Person is enrolled in two or more Closed Panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provis ion of service by a non-panel provider, benefit s are not payabl e by one Closed Panel Plan, COB shall not apply betwee n that Plan and other Closed Pane l Plans. Right to Receive and Release Needed Information C ertain fa cts about he alth care coverag e and service s are needed to a pply these COB rules and to determ ine benefits payable under this plan and other Plans. The claims adminis trator may g et the facts it needs from or give them to other o rganizati ons or persons for t he purp ose of applying these rules and determ ining benefits payable under this Plan and other Plans cover ing the p erson claimi ng benefits. The claims administrat or need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each Covered Person cl aiming benefits under this Plan mu st give the claims admin istrator any facts it needs to apply those rules and det ermine benefi ts payab le. Facility of Payment A payment m ade under an other Plan may include an amount that should have been paid under this Pla n. If it does, the claims administrator may pay that amount to the orga nizati on that made that p ayment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a bene fit paid under this Plan. The claims administrat or will not have to p ay that amount again. T he term \"payment made\" incl udes providi ng benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment ma de\" means reason able cash value of the benefits provided in the form of se rvices. Right of Recovery If the amoun t of the payment s made by the claim s administrato r is more than it shoul d have paid under thi s COB provi sion, it may recove r the excess from one or more of the person s it has paid o r for whom it has paid; or a ny other pe rson or orga nizatio n that may be responsi ble for the be nefits or services provided for the Covered Pe rson. The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable ca sh value of any benefit s provided i n the form of services. Surrogacy arrangements If You enter into a Surrogacy Arrangement and You or any other payee are entitled to receive payments or other compensation under the Surrogacy Arrangement, You must reimburse Us for covered Services You receive related to conception, pregnancy, delivery, or postpartum care in connection with that arrangement (\"Surrogacy Health Services\") except that we will recover no more than half of the monetary compensation you receive.

CONTINUATI ON OF MEDICAL BENE FITS (FEDE RAL) This section only appli es to Pa rticipatin g Emp loyers who are subject to Publi c Law 99-2 71 (COBRA ). Eligibility for Continue d Healt h Coverage A Covered Person whose group he alth coverage un der the policy would end due to a qualifying event may have a ri ght to elect continu ed H ealth Cover age for a limited period. The phra se \"health cover age\" means the benefits of the policy that are based on Expenses Incurred for medical care. A \" Qualifyin g Event \" is any one of the followin g events if it would cause the Cover ed Pe rson to lose health cover age under the policy: \"A\" The death of the covered employee; \"B\" The termination (other than by reason of the covered employee's gr oss miscondu ct), or redu ction ployee's em ployme nt; \"C\" The divorce or legal separation of the covered employee and his or her spouse, partner in a civil union or Domestic Partner; \"D\" The covered employee's be coming entitled to Medic are benefits; \"E\" A child's ceasing to be an e ligible Dependent under the terms of this health insu rance plan. Written Notices and Election Required Covere d Perso ns must no tify their employer s of a qualifying event set forth in \"C\" or \"E\". That no tice must be given within sixty (60) days after the even t occurs . If such timel y notice is not given, the event will not entitle the Cover ed Person to continued h ealth coverage. The em pl oyer will notify Covere d Persons who becom e entitle d to elect continue d healt h coverage. That notice will be furnished within fourteen ( 14) days of: (a) the date timely notic e of a qualifyi ng event set forth in \"C\" or \"E\" is receiv ed; or (b) the date any other qualifying event occurs . If that notice from the employer is not given or is la te, the qualifyin g event will not entitl e the Covered Person to continued h ealth coverage. Should a court or governm ent agency requi re KPIC to pay any benefits as though coverage had been conti nued, the employ er will reimbu rse KPIC in the full amount that KPIC is re quired to pay. A Covered P erson will ha ve sixty (60) days in which to elect continued he alth covera ge. That sixty (60) days starts with the later of: (a) the date the qualify ing event would cause the Cover ed Pe rson to lo se health coverage under this health i nsurance plan; or (b) the date the empl oyer provi des timely notic e to the Covered Perso n of his or h er right to elect conti nued h ealth coverage. A Covered Person who do es not make a timely written election will not receive continued h ealth coverage unless in cluded as a spouse, partner in a civil union or Dome stic Partn er or child in another famil y member' s timel y election. Effect of Other Continuations If this health insurance plan otherwise provid es any healt h coverage after a q ualifyin g event: (a) such coverage that is not an option will not defer or ex tend the maximum period of continued health cover age in this provis ion; and (b) such coverag e that is an elec ted option will be deemed a waive r of continued healt h coverage under this provision. Howev er, if a covered employee el ects such alternate h ealth coverage for a spou se, partner in a civil union or Domestic Partner or child; and while that coverage is in effec t another qualifyin g event occurs ; then the alternate health coverage for the spouse, partner in a civil union o r Domestic Partner or child will n ot end so oner than it would have under this provisi on. Payment for Continued Health Coverage The empl oyer may require a Covered Pe rson to pay f or this conti nued he alth covera ge. That payment will not exce ed 102 pe rcent of the total employ er and employee cost of providi ng the same b 2023 Covere Perso n who has not had a qu alifyin g event . The Covered Person will not be requi red to make such paymen ts less freque ntly than monthly. Benefits under Continued Health Coverage This continued healt h coverage will at all times provide the same healt h care benefit s as would have been afforded to the Covered Pe rson had a qu alifying event not occurred. This includes any changes in the health co verage under this health i nsurance plan as may become effective while continued h ealth coverage i s in effect. Termination of Continued Health Coverage A Covered P erson 's conti nued health co verage u nder this provis ion will end at the earliest of the followi ng dates: 1. The date wh ich ends the \" Maximum P eriod\" as defi ned bel ow; 2. The date th at This Plan no long er covers the employer that spon sored the coverage before the Qualifying Event; 3. The date en ding the last period for wh ich the Cover ed Pers on has made any r equired pay ment for continued He alth Covera ge on a timely bas is; or 4. T he date aft er electi ng continued Heal th Coverage on whi ch the Cover ed Person first becomes: a) covered und er any ot her group health p lan (as an employee or otherwise) which doe s not exclude or limit any pre- existing condi tion of the C overed Pers on; or b) entitled to Medic are benefits. The \" Maxim um Period\" referred to above will start with the date of the Qualifying Even t and will end: (a) with the date eighteen ( 18) mont hs after a q ualifyin g event set forth in \"B\"; or (b) with the date thirty -six (36) mont hs after any other Qualifyin g Event . In applyin g this maximum pe riod, if continued health coverage is a lread y in effec t when a qu alifyin g even t other than as set forth in \"B\" occurs , the maxi mum period will not end le ss than thirty -six (36) months from the date of the original qualifyin g event; and if a Qualifyin g Even t set forth in \"D\" occurs, the Maximum Period as to the Covered Employee 's spouse, partner in a civil union or Dome stic Partner or child for that or any subseq uent Qualifying Event will not end less t han thirty -six (36) m onths from the date the Covere d Employee be came entitle d to Medica re benefits. Extensi on fo r Disabled Covered Persons If Socia l Security , under its rules, de termines that a Covered Pe rson was disabled when a Qualifying Even t set forth in \"B\" occurred, the 18-mont h maxi mum period of conti nued health coverage for such a Qualifyin g Even t may be extended to twenty -nine (29) mont hs. To obtai n that extension, the Covered Perso n must notify the employer of Socia l Security's determ ination before the in itial 18-month maximum period ends. For the continued he alth coverage of disabled Covere d Pe rsons that exceed s eighteen (18) months, KPIC may increase t he premium it c harges by as much as 50 percent. The em ployer may require the disabled Covered Pe rsons to pay all or part of that total increased premiu m. In no event will continued Healt h Coverage extend beyond the first mont h to be gin more than thirty (30) days after Social Security determines that the Covered Person is no longer disabl ed. The Cover ed Perso n must notify the employ er within thirty (30) d ays of the date of such a So cial Secu rity determ ination. Continued Health Coverage from a Prior Plan C ontinued He alth Coverage will al so be provided if: (a) this health i nsurance plan replaced a prior benefit plan of the em ployer or an associated comp any; and (b) a person's continued health coverage u nder a provis ion of that prior plan similar to this en ded due to the replacement of that prior plan.

Pr e -Service Claims and Appeals Pre-service Claims are requests that We pay for a Service that You have not yet received. Failure to receive authorization before receiving a Service that must be authorized or pre- certified in order to be a covered benefit may be the basis for Our denial of Your Pre- service Claim. If You receive any of the Services You are requesting before We make Our decision, Your Pre- service Claim or Appeal will become a Post -service Claim or Appeal with respect to those Services. If You have any general questions about Pre- service Claims or Appeals, please call Permanente Advantage at 1-8 88-525- 1533 or 711 (TTY). Here are the procedures for filing a Pre- service claim, a Non- Urgent Pre- service Appeal, and an Urgent Pre-service Appeal. a.

We will decide whether Your Claim is Urgent or Non- Urgent unless Your attending health care provider tells Us Your Claim is Urgent.

Generally, a Claim is Urgent only if using the procedure for Non- Urgent Claims: (a) Could seriously jeopardize Your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function; or (b) If You have a physical or mental disability that creates an imminent and substantial limitation on Your existing ability to live independently; or (c) Would, in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of Your medical condition, subject You to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the Services You are requesting. We may, but are not required to, waive the requirements related to an urgent claim and appeal thereof, to permit you to pursue an Expedited External Review. Non- U rgent Pre- Service Claim We wil l review Your Claim and, if We have all the information We need, We will make a decision within a reasonable period of time but not later than five (5) business days after We receive Your Claim.

External Review Following receipt of an adverse First Level Appeal or Voluntary Second Level Appeal decision letter, You may have a right to request an External Review. There is no minimum dollar amount for a claim to be eligible for an External Review. You will not be responsible for the cost of the External Review. You have the right to request an independent External Review of our decision if our decision involves an adverse benefit determination regarding a denial of a claim, in whole or in part, that is (1) A denial of a preauthorization for a Service; (2) A denial of a request for Services on the ground that the Service is not Medically Necessary, appropriate, effective or efficient or is not provided in or at the appropriate health care setting or level of care; and/or (3) A denial of a request for Services on the ground that the Service is experimental or investigational. If our final adverse decision does not involve an adverse benefit determination described in the preceding sentence, then your claim is not eligible for External Review. However, independent External Review is available when we deny your appeal because you request medical care that is excluded under your plan and you present evidence from a licensed Colorado professional that there is a reasonable medical basis that the exclusion does not apply. To request External Review, You must submit a completed Independent External Review of Carrier's Final Adverse Determination form (you may call Member Relations at 1-8 00-788-0710- to request another copy of this form) which will be included with the mandatory internal appeal decision letter and explanation of Your Appeal rights, to Member Appeals Program within four (4) months of the date of receipt of Our mandatory First Level Appeal decision or of Our Voluntary Second Level Appeal decision.

We must receive all of this information prior to the end of the applicable timeframe (4 months) for Your request of External Review. Expedited External Review You may request an Expedited External Review if (1) You have a medical condition for which the timeframe for completion of a standard review would seriously jeopardize Your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function; or, (2) If You have a physical or mental existing disability that creates an imminent and substantial limitation to Your existing ability to live independently, or (3) In the opinion of a Physician with knowledge of Your medical condition, the timeframe for completion of a standard review would subject You to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the medical services that You are seeking. You may request Expedited External Review simultaneously with your expedited internal appeal as permitted under this Plan. A request for an Expedited External Review must be accompanied by a written statement from Your Physician that Your condition meets the expedited criteria. You must include the Physician's certification that You meet External Review criteria when You submit Your request for External Review along with the other required information (described, above). No Expedited External Review is available when You have already received the medical care that is the subject of Your request for External Review.

Additional Requirements for External Review regarding Experimental or Investigational Services You may request External Review or expedited External Review involving an adverse benefit determination based upon the Service being experimental or investigational. Your request for External Review or expedited External Review must include a written statement from your physician that either (a) Standar d health care services or treatments have not been effective in improving your condition or are not medically appropriate for you, or (b)There is no available standard health care service or treatment covered under this plan that is more beneficial than the recommended or requested health care service (the physician must certify that scientifically valid studies using accepted protocols demonstrate that the requested health care service or treatment is more likely to be more beneficial to you than an available standard health care services or treatments), and the physician is a licensed, board- certified, or board- eligible physician to practice in the area of medicine to treat your condition. If you are requesting expedited External Review, then your physician must also certify that the requested health care service or treatment would be less effective if not promptly initiated. These certifications must be submitted with your request for External Review. After we receive your request for External Review, we shall notify you of the information regarding the independent External Review entity that the Division of Insurance has selected to conduct the External Review. If We deny Your request for Standard or Expedited External Review, including any assertion that We have not complied with the applicable requirements related to Our Internal Claims and Appeals Procedure, then We may notify You in writing and include the specific reasons for the denial. Our notice will include information about your right to appeal the denial to the Division of Insurance. At the same time that We send this denial notice to You, We will send a copy of it to the Division of Insurance.

Within forty -five (45) days of the Independent External Review entity's receipt of Your request for Standard External Review, it shall provide written notice of its decision to You. If the Independent External Review entity is deciding Your Expedited External Review request, then the Independent External Review entity shall make its decision as expeditiously as possible and no more than seventy -two (72) hours after its receipt of Your request for External Review and within forty -eight (48) hours of notifying You orally of its decision provide written confirmation of its decision. This notice shall explain that the External Review decision is the final appeal available under state insurance law. An External Review decision is binding on KPIC and You except to the extent KPIC and You have other remedies available under federal or state law. You or your designated representative may not file a subsequent request for External Review involving the same adverse determination for which you have already received an External Review deci sion. If the Independent External Review Organization overturns Our denial of payment for care You have already received, We will issue payment within five (5) working days. If the Independent Review organization overturns Our decision not to authorize Pr e-service or Concurrent Care Claims, KPIC will authorize care within one (1) working day. Such Covered Services shall be provided subject to the terms and conditions applicable to benefits under this health insurance plan. Except when External Review is permitted to occur simultaneously with your urgent pre- service appeal or urgent concurrent care appeal, You must exhaust Our Internal Claims and Appeals Procedure (but not the Voluntary Second Level of Appeal) for Your Claim before You may request External Review, unless We have failed to comply with federal and/or state law requirements regarding Our Claims and Appeals Procedures. Additional Review You may have certain additional rights if You remain dissatisfied after You have exhausted Our Internal Claims and Appeals Procedures, and if applicable, External Review.
