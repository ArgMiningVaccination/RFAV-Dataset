Type of Medicines - Allopathic - Ayurvedic - Homeopathic - Homeopathy, or homeopathic medicine, is a medical philosophy and practice based on the idea that the body can heal itself. Homeopathy was founded in the late 1700s in Germany and has been widely practiced throughout Europe. Homeopathic medicine views symptoms of illness as normal responses of the body as it attempts to regain health. Homeopathy is based on the idea that \"like cures like.\" That is, if a substance causes a symptom in a healthy person, giving the person a very small amount of the same substance may cure the illness. In theory, a homeopathic dose enhances the body's normal healing and self-regulatory processes. A homeopathic health practitioner (homeopath) uses pills or liquid mixtures (solutions) containing only a little of an active ingredient (usually a plant or mineral) for the treatment of disease. These are known as highly diluted or \"potentiated\" substances. There isn't strong evidence from science to show that homeopathic medicines are effective for any specific condition. Some people have used homeopathy to maintain health and treat a wide range of long-term illnesses, such as allergies, atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and irritable bowel syndrome. They have also used it to treat minor injuries, such as cuts and scrapes and muscle strains or sprains. Homeopathic treatment is not considered appropriate for illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, major infections, or emergencies. Homeopathy has been widely used in India, England, and other European countries. Warts, otherwise known as verruca or Condylomata, are locally occurring benign growths on the skin that are most commonly caused by Human Papilloma Virus. The virus enters through injuries like cuts and bruises and they multiply rapidly and form blister-like formations on the skin, called warts. Common warts do not cause pain or discomfort unless they are situated in areas that are being constantly irritated. Homeopathy has been successful in getting rid of existing warts, preventing the formation of new ones, and reducing the skin's tendency of forming new ones. Medicines can be taken orally and there is little or no local application. The treatment is from within and is permanent. The duration for which the treatment is taken varies from patient to patient, the severity of warts, and their chronicity. Acne occurs when pores on the skin become clogged due to dirt, debris, and bacteria. Skin produces sebum naturally which maintains the elasticity of the skin. Sometimes when there is excessive production of oil, it tends to attract dirt and clogs the pores. Acne is mostly associated with teenagers but can occur in people at any age. There are various contributing factors to acne formation, hormonal imbalances, unhealthy food and lifestyle choices, stress, and menstrual cycle being a few. The condition itself is minor, but if not treated promptly, can cause scarring. Homeopathy has proven effective in the treatment of acne as it treats the root cause and promotes healthy skin. There are primarily two types of acne, non-inflammatory and inflammatory acne. Whiteheads and blackheads are the non-inflammatory variety while papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts are the inflammatory kind. Homeopathy offers long-term cures for the prevention of acne formation, by targeting the root causes or triggers that cause it. It treats the causes of hormonal fluctuations and also helps reduce acute symptoms of acne-like pain, inflammation, and swelling. Pigmentation is the darkening of facial skin due to the excessive production of a pigment called melanin. The medical term is melisma, where patches of pigmentation appear on the face, especially the cheeks, nose, forehead, and upper lip. Facial Pigmentation is more common in women, but in some cases, can also occur in men. Major causes are hormonal changes in women during pregnancy, during menopause, consumption of contraceptive pills, and hyperthyroidism. Other trigger factors include stress, inadequate sleep, and overexposure to the sun. Homeopathy has a safe and effective remedy for treating facial pigmentation. They help by restoring an even tone to the skin and halting further progression of the condition. Did you know that allergy is the most common health problem in the world? Changes to the environment, society, and lifestyle all contribute to the rising number of allergies today. Factors that increase the risk of developing allergies include inadequate nutrient intake, environmental pollution, stress, lack of physical activities, side effects of medication, obesity, tobacco and alcohol consumption, and lastly, genetics. Common allergic symptoms include, but are not limited to, coughing, dry itchy skin, ear discomfort, runny or blocked nose, watery or itchy eyes with redness, sneezing, and breathing difficulties. Homeopathy has effective, constitutional medicines for allergies. This means that a remedy is chosen considering the totality of the symptoms the person is experiencing. This requires the guidance and expertise of a professional homeopath, and a detailed consultation is necessary to embark on this method of treatment. People can use homeopathic remedies to alleviate symptoms in the acute stages of their allergy. This will not completely cure the allergy but will provide temporary relief without any side effects. Asthma is a condition where the airways that carry air into and out of your lungs become extra sensitive to particles carried along with air when you breathe. It tends to be hereditary and is higher in families that have a history of allergies and in people who smoke or are exposed to it. When a person with asthma comes into contact with an allergen in the air, the lining of the airways or the muscles surrounding the airways tend to swell causing it to constrict, or mucus builds up which can cause difficulty in breathing. Commonly manifested symptoms include tightness in the chest, wheezing, and coughing. Homeopathy offers safe and permanent cures for asthma, as the medication treats the problem at the root cause. The treatments encourage the body's restorative processes by strengthening the natural healing system. In cases where the cause for asthma is an allergic reaction, homeopathy treats the causative elements of the allergy safely and without side effects. Chronic pain is one of the most common reasons people try out alternative pain management therapies. Some of the chronic pains that are treated with homeopathy are aching muscles, sprains and bruises, aching, swollen or stiff joints and muscles, shooting pains that result from nerve damage, and arthritis and back pain, which are worse in the morning, but gets better with hot water fomentation and movement. Homeopathy personalized treatment to each individual, and it may be more economical than regular pharmaceutical medicines. Usually, a combination of remedies is given, out of which a few ingredients may help treat the pain. Treatment is safe and has long-term benefits. Anxiety is when a person is in a constant state of worry and is unable to relax. Small things can keep them on edge for many days. People who suffer chronic anxiety worry and exhibit tension when there is nothing to provoke such a reaction. They always anticipate things going wrong and worry excessively about money, health, work, and family, to name a few. Their anxiety is more than the situation warrants. Sometimes there are physical manifestations like fatigue, headaches, muscle tension, aches, difficulty swallowing, shaking, twitching, irritability, sweating, and hot flashes. They may also experience nausea and frequently go to the bathroom. Depression is dangerous as it can be difficult to identify the symptoms in the initial stages. People tend to overlook it as a mere low-mood or worse, think it is part of their psychological nature. Friends and family also have difficulty identifying the condition. Conventional medicines fail in the treatment of depression because when adequate results are not seen, the dosage and the number of medicines are simply increased. This case of \"polypharmacy\" may worsen the condition, and not relieve it. Homeopathy offers solutions to anxiety disorders and depression by understanding physical and psychological reasons for the patient's symptoms. A remedy is given that best suits the overall scope of symptoms, which helps them to experience a better state of health on all levels. There are effective treatments to depression in homeopathy and they are individualized to each person's specific condition and history. The results are long-term, safe, and sometimes more effective than conventional treatments. "}
