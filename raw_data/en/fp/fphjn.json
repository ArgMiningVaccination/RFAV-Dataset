Our naturopath will do a comprehensive assessment of your health symptoms at the initial visit, and you will be required to do some blood and urine testing. Conventional treatment options for menopause symptoms like hot flashes are often treated with hormone replacement therapy, or HRT. HRT adds back in the estrogen and sometimes the progesterone that the body no longer makes.", "sitename": null, "date": "2004-01-01", "cleaned_text": "There are various treatment options available to manage perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms in conventional and naturopathic medicine. It is important to have a thorough discussion with your healthcare provider regarding the benefits and risks of different options for reducing symptoms and health risks associated with menopause. Current or past breast or uterine cancer, chronic or acute liver disease, [endometriosi](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/endometriosis.html)s, current blood clots or a history of blood clots, a history of stroke, recent heart attack, pancreatic disease, gallbladder disease, fibrocystic breast disease, familial high cholesterol, high blood pressure [migraine headaches](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/migraines.html) uterine tumors, and undiagnosed vaginal bleeding. Given all this, it may be best for many women to seek alternative treatments for hot flashes. At the Nature's Intentions Naturopathic Clinic, our focus is geared toward treating the root cause of the problem naturally. Our naturopath will do a comprehensive assessment of your health symptoms at the initial visit, and you will be required to do some blood and urine testing. She may also suggest additional hormone testing and other laboratory tests in order to assess any imbalances in the body that may be affecting your health. She may recommend some natural treatments for menopausal and perimenopausal symptoms [*](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/menopause/conventional-and-naturopathic-treatments-for-menopause.html#Disclaimer) such as: Increase intake of the following foods: Although flaxseeds are much higher in lignans, sea vegetables, including dulse, hijikis, and arame, also contain lignans that may be helpful with those hot flashes. Throw some hijiki on that salad, right on top of the flaxseeds, and eat your way to a symptom-free menopause. The lignans found in high levels in flaxseeds are also found in a number of other foods. In particular, they have been found in rye, oats, barley, and wheat germ. Sunflower seeds and bean sprouts also contain other types of phytoestrogens that may be helpful. Including some of these foods in your diet may not only help with this natural stage of life, they will also add wonderful variety. Reports seem to indicate that yams (those of the Dioscoreae family) may be helpful during the menopause. Some cultures believe that eating yams can be beneficial, especially around this time of life. Several studies have reported that Vitamin E reduces the frequency of hot flashes in some women. Vitamin E is especially recommended for treating the hot flashes of women with a history of breast cancer who cannot take hormone replacement therapy. It is unknown exactly how vitamin E prevents hot flashes, though it is known that vitamin E is very good for stabilizing blood vessel function. It may therefore prevent hot flashes by preventing the blood vessels from dilating so much and causing flushing. In addition, vitamin E is also excellent for preventing atherosclerosis and heart disease. Mustard greens, chard, turnip greens, and sunflower seeds are a few excellent sources of vitamin E. Magnesium may help decrease stress and promote normal sleeping patterns through its ability to relax and calm the nervous system. Chard and spinach are two excellent food sources of magnesium. Calcium has been found to reduce bone loss that accompanies the drop in hormone levels caused by menopause. Excellent sources of calcium include spinach, turnip greens, mustard greens, and collard greens. Omega-3 Fatty Acids have been found to reduce risk of heart disease and may help regulate hormone levels. (When estrogen levels drop, women become at greater risk for heart disease). Some food sources of omega-3 fatty acids are flax seeds, walnuts and cold water fish, like salmon, cod, and halibut. The following preventive measures may help diminish symptoms and reduce the risk of serious complications (such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease) associated with menopause: Please come in for a naturopathic consultation before starting on any supplements. Its is better to first identify the root cause of your menopausal symptoms and then treat it with the right remedies, based on your specific assessment of health and hormones even though those mentioned above have minimal side effects.
