The most common way to extract essential oils is through steam distillation. This involves using cold water and steam to extract the oil from its botanical. Steam is passed through a dome-like vessel containing the plant material necessary for the essential oil. This releases the aromatic compounds of the plant and pushes them to the top of the vessel. These vapours are then sent to a cooling chamber where they condense. This liquid is separated and collected, making a pure essential oil. Some citrus oils can be cold pressed as opposed to steam distilled, but most common oils will use this method as standard. Can I pick more than one essential oil at once?

Essential oils are natural substances that are extracted from plants, fruits, trees, and herbs. People often buy essential oils as a way to boost their minds, bodies, and spirits in different ways. There are a number of methods for extracting natural essential oils, including steam distillation and cold pressing. They have been used for centuries in aromatherapy to help promote general health and wellbeing. Sometimes you can find organic essential oils as well as [essential oil blends](https://nikura.com/collections/blends) that combine various natural scents together. The history of essential oils The use of plants for medicinal purposes dates all the way back to 60,000 BCE. While it's difficult to determine exactly when essential oils came about, it is known that they existed in various forms from around 3,000 BCE. Ancient Ayurvedic societies, as well as the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians, have all recorded the use of aromatherapy in some way. During the Dark Ages in Europe, many aromatherapy practices were sadly forgotten. It was only until the Great Plague that these remedies were once again used to help treat sufferers. Aromatherapy as we now understand it is said to have begun in late 19th century France and was coined by Ren\u00e9-Maurice Gattefoss\u00e9 following treatment from a burn using lavender oil. Common uses of essential oils There are numerous ways to use essential oils - that's one of their greatest assets as an all-natural product. Typically, most people will enjoy essential oils through the process of diffusion. Using a diffuser or oil burner, oil is added to the device and dispersed into the air. This makes it easy to inhale and enjoy throughout the day. Other common aromatherapy methods include diluting the essential oil with a carrier oil and applying the mixture to skin, hair, and nails. Each oil will have its own set of benefits that appeal to topical application. Massages using essential oils are also very popular and can help relax tense muscles as well as promote calm. Recently, essential oils have been used to help scent crafts such as candles, wax melts, soaps, and more. "}
