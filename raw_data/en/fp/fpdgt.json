Biofeedback Biofeedback is a non-invasive psychophysiological intervention\u2014used as a stand-alone treatment or in combination with other therapies\u2014offering a visible and experiential display of the mind-body connection. With biofeedback, physiological signals are detected by sensors attached to a person's body and accurately fed back to them in real-time. This auditory or visual feedback enables people to identify the physical signs and symptoms of stress and anxiety, including shortness of breath, muscle tension, increased heart rate, etc. In turn, someone can learn how to self-regulate their physical responses and improve their overall health and functioning.17 There are different types, techniques, and ways to engage in biofeedback (in-person/at home with the assistance, guidance, and supervision of a certified professional).

Then, exhale slowly through your mouth, as if you're expelling all your worries away. This calming technique can be done anywhere for instant stress relief. However, making this a habit can have an even greater impact on your overall health.20 16. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is another non-invasive, clinically effective outpatient intervention known to help a variety of mental health conditions. There are different types of TMS, and the course of treatment can vary. During the procedure a small coil is placed on a person's scalp which then releases a brief magnetic pulse, altering nerve cells that assist mood regulation. These changes in brain activity may alleviate the symptoms being treated.21 Although TMS has been used for depression and other clinical concerns, researchers have started to examine its potential application to anxiety disorders. A recent meta-analysis found that TMS can be a safe and effective therapeutic option for reducing symptoms of anxiety with reportedly sustained improvement after treatment. To determine if TMS is suitable for you, consult with your health care practitioner or mental health counselor first.22 17.
