What our Customers are saying \"My period is regular for the first time in my life\" \"I found out about Feminade when I was researching how to alleviate issues that I was having with my period. Since puberty I had very long, very heavy, very irregular periods and was told that my only solution was hormonal birth control, specifically an IUD. While my periods stopped, I was suffering from extreme mood swings, anxiety, daily menstrual cramping, and depression. It was affecting my whole life and I felt like I was being put on hold just to cope with the symptoms. Throughout this, I was constantly told by my doctors that these symptoms were normal and would balance themselves over time. After two years, I was finally able to get the IUD removed and my symptoms almost immediately worsened. My periods began longer, heavier and I eventually had to go the emergency room after dealing with heavy bleeding for 53 days. When I asked my doctors about hormone testing, I was always brushed off and told that \"hormones change every day\" and \"just lose weight and your period will be regular,\" which hurt all the more because I have a history of eating disorders and disordered eating. I found some at-home hormone tests I could take, and Feminade was one of them. Unlike the other at-home test I had taken, Feminade was really invaluable to me because it came with consulting with a doctor who could explain my results in detail and provide me with realistic, concrete recommendations while also being mindful of my health history. In the six months since my consultation with Dr Biller (who is an absolute joy to work with. A gem. 10/10), my period is regular for the first time in my life, my mental health has improved, and my overall health has improved significantly. The conversation was never about what can be taken out of my routine, but what can be added. The supplements I was recommended were helpful to my unique health story and easy to incorporate in my daily routine. Getting concrete answers about what I could do to improve my menstrual and overall health also helped me to better advocate for myself as a patient when I go to the doctor. I was doing so much research on my own beforehand, but Feminade made navigating my menstrual health easy and approachable. I've already told friends about my journey, but I will absolutely continue doing so. It's easily the best investment I've made for my health in years.\" Amanda V. Primary Symptom: Heavy & Irregular Cycles The best investment I could make in my health \"I loved everything about Feminade. The kit arrived quickly, instructions were easy to follow, sample drop off was easy, results came back and directly into my inbox, and the consult with the Dr. was amazing. I have had problems with ovulation for many years, but never really understood why. This is why I did the Feminade test. The report showed several of my hormones were so low, no wonder my cycle was not healthy! Dr Erin did a fantastic job of going through each and every one of my results to explain what it meant AND provide me with a personalized action plan. Within 1 month of treatment, I can feeling SO much better. The best investment I could make in my health, thanks Feminade for allowing me to understand my hormones and take steps to get back into balance.\" Dr. Amy B.
