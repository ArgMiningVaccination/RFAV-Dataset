Factors such as stress, trauma, chronic disease, systemic illness, immune disorders, and age-related decline in host immunologic responses can potentially incite reactivation. Activation of VZV resulting in shingles following acupuncture has been reported in the literature previously, and some mechanisms have been proposed for this observation. Case: A patient with a history of total thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer presented with chronic neck pain. She was clinically and biochemically in a euthyroid state and on thyroid replacement therapy. She had a history of chickenpox, at age 13, and seasonal allergies. After her first acupuncture session, she received an allergy shot for her seasonal allergies. A day after the procedure, she developed a vesicular rash and was subsequently diagnosed with acute Herpes zoster. Subsequent acupuncture was withheld following this event. She received acyclovir and applied topical Aloe vera to the cutaneous lesions, and developed mild scarring, but did not experience postherpetic neuralgia. Conclusions: Acupuncture is a minor trauma that can predispose a patient to reactivation of VZV and shingles in the setting of with allergen immunotherapy.
