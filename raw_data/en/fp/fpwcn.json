A: Shingles is the reactivation of the chickenpox (varicella-zoster) virus that most people were exposed to during childhood. After we recover from chickpox as children, the virus lays dormant in the body. For reasons unknown, as we age sometimes the virus gets reactivated, resulting in shingles. Q: Can I still get Shingles if I have had the Shingrix Vaccine? A: Shingrix is more than 90% effective at preventing shingles and long-term nerve pain. Q: What is the cost of the Shingrix Vaccine? A: This varies from each individuals plan, but generally speaking we see the average co-pay to be in the $20-30 range, with co-pays as low as $0 to as high as $150. Stop in today or give us a quick phone call and we will be happy to find out what your co-pay would be. Q: Who should not get the Shingrix Vaccine? A: have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine or after a dose of Shingrix Currently have shingles Tested negative for immunity to varicella zoster virus. If you test negative, you should get chickenpox vaccine. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should wait to get Shingrix. If you have a minor acute (starts suddenly) illness, such as a cold, you may get Shingrix. But if you have a moderate or severe acute illness, you should usually wait until you recover before getting the vaccine. This includes anyone with a temperature of 101.3\u00b0F or higher. Q: Is Shingles contagious? A: Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to a person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters, not through sneezing, coughing or casual contact. A person with shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If you have shingles - Keep the rash covered. - Do not touch or scratch the rash. [Wash your hands often](http://www.cdc.gov/features/handwashing/)to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. - Until your rash has developed crusts, avoid contact with - pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the varicella vaccine; - premature or low birth weight infants; and - immunocompromised persons (such as persons receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with HIV infection). Q: What are the side effects of the Shingrix Vaccine? A: Studies show that Shingrix is safe. The vaccine helps your body create a strong defense against shingles. As a result, you are likely to have temporary side effects from getting the shots. The side effects may affect your ability to do normal daily activities for 2 to 3 days. Most people got a sore arm with mild or moderate pain after getting Shingrix, and some also had redness and swelling where they got the shot. Some people felt tired, had muscle pain, a headache, shivering, fever, stomach pain, or nausea. About 1 out of 6 people who got Shingrix experienced side effects that prevented them from doing regular activities. Symptoms went away on their own in about 2 to 3 days. Side effects were more common in younger people. You might have a reaction to the first or second dose of Shingrix, or both doses. If you experience side effects, you may choose to take over-the-counter pain medicine such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If you experience side effects from Shingrix, you should report them to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS websiteexternal icon, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. The shingles vaccine does not contain thimerosal (a preservative containing mercury). Q: How do I get the Shingrix Vaccine? A: Stop in to King's Pharmacy anytime! No appointment necessary.
