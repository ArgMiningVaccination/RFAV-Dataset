We often think of reactions to food as being a rapid allergic reaction, such as w hen a person has an anaphylactic reaction to eating peanuts and their throat swells up. However, there are other ways our bodies can react to foods that may not be so immediate, and may or may not be tied to an immune system response . Food intolerances may be triggered by various natural compounds found in foods (natural sugars or proteins) or common food additives (such as natural and artificial colors, preservatives, antioxidants, and flavor enhancers) that can cause reactions through various mechanisms in the body. There is currently dispute about the specific mechanisms involved in different reactions to foods, and many tests to identify the suspected culprit(s) can be unreliable. Clinical experience has shown that an elimination diet is one of the best tools for identifying food culprits and is very safe, as long a variety of foods are still eaten supplying all the essential nutrients. Symptoms Symptoms of food intolerance can vary widely . They can include stomach and bowel irritation, headaches, hives, itching, and even vague feelings of being unwell, such as flu- like aches and pains , unusual tiredness , or concentration problems . Certain foods and food groups are also known to exacerbate symptoms in peopl e with specific conditions such as autoimmune disorders, migraines, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) and others.2 Symptoms and their severity are unique to the individual . They are influenced by specific compounds in the food, a person's sensitivity level, and how much of certain foods are eaten. If the same food is eaten repeatedly, or different foods with the same compound are eaten together or often, the body may reach a threshold, or a tipping point where symptoms begin to occ ur. Natural Food Substances Even \"healthy\" foods contain many different naturally occurring chemicals that can be a problem for some people. Substances common to many different foods, such as salicylates, amines, and glutamate, may cause symptoms for diff erent individuals . It is beyond the scope of this handout to provide detail about the different categories of natural substances that may cause symptoms , but this can be explored with a practitioner who is comfortabl e working with elimination diets (not al l practitioners are) . Individual Variation Because people are unique genetically, and because we each have different eating patterns, elimination diets have to be based on each unique individual. E liminating the most offending food or multiple foods and substances all at one time is the most reliable way to find out which foods may be contributing to symptoms. A healthcare practitioner may recommend a specific plan to follow based on symptoms, typical dietary choices, and food cravings. 2 Elimination Diet PATIENT HANDOUT University of Wisconsin Integrative Health www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative There are four main steps to an elimination diet: Step 1 - Planning Work with your health care practitioner to learn which foods might be causing problems. You may be asked to keep a diet journal for a week, listing the foods you eat and keeping track of the symptoms you have throughout the day. See the last page of this handout for a Food Diary Chart you can use. It is helpful to ask yourself a few key questions: What foods do I eat most often? What foods do I crave? What foods do I eat to \"feel better\"? What foods would I have trouble giving up? Often, these seem to be the foods that are most important to try not to eat. Also, see Table 1 for a list of the most common problem foods . Make a list of potential problem foods. The elimination diet can vary in intensity depending on how many suspected food culprits are being avoided. Three different \"levels\" of food elimination can be followed depending on suspected food culprits and likelihood of adhering to the diet. The three levels are described below in the Elimination Diet Strategies section on page 6. It is helpful to think about choosing the strategy that is the least restrictive first in order to maximize successful adherence to the restrictions . However, the more restric tive strategies are more effective at identifying cases where there are multiple food culprits. Are You Ready? Before starting an elimination diet, it is important to consider whether this is a good time to undertake these potentially large changes in diet . Do you have any upcoming stressful life events or travel? Do you have the resources, willingness, and energy to create new grocery lists and menus to cook new recipes? Do you have support from family and friends for eating at home, at work, or out at res taurants and other events? It will be important to completely eliminate the foods on your list for 2 -4 weeks, so if you accidentally eat one of the foods, you will need to start again. It will be quicker and easier if you are successful the first time. Step 2 - Avoiding Make a list of foods to avoid based on your planning, and be sure of how to avoid possible \"hidden foods\" (See Table 3 Hidden Foods). Begin the elimination diet and for two to four weeks, follow the elimination diet without any exceptions . Don't eat the eliminated foods whole or as ingredients in other foods. For example, if you are avoiding all dairy products, you need to check labels for whey, casein, and lactose so you can avoid them as well. This The Elimination Diet Steps 3 Elimination Diet PATIENT HANDOUT University of Wisconsin Integrative Health www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative step takes a lot of discipline. You mus t pay close attention to food labels. Be particularly careful if you are eating out, since you have less control over what goes into the food you eat. If you make a mistake and eat something on the list, you should start over. Many people notice that in t he first week, especially in the first few days, their symptoms will become worse before they start to improve. If your symptoms become severe or increase for more than a day or two, consult your health care practitioner. Table 1 Common Culprits for Food Allergy and Intolerance Step 3 - Challenging If your symptoms have not improved in two weeks, continue for up to four weeks. If your symptoms have not improved by the end of four weeks, stop the diet and explore whether or not to try this process again with a different combination of foods. You should be symptom -free for at least 5 days before beginning your food challenges . If your symptoms have improved, start \"challenging\" your body with the eliminated foods, one food at a time. As you do this, use the Food Diary at the end of this documen t to keep a written record of your symptoms. To challenge your body, add a new food back in every three days. It takes three days to be sure that your symptoms have time to come back if they are going to. It is suggested that you eat a small amount on day 1 of re- introduction, have about twice the amount on day two, and then an even larger portion on day 3. See Table 2 for a sample calendar. It is important to note that some foods Common Food and Food Comp onent Culprits Foods Additives and Natural Compounds Citrus Antioxid ants (butylated hydroxyanisole and hydroxytoluene) Dairy Products Aspartame (NutraSweet, an artificial sweetener) Eggs Flavor enhancers (monosodium glutamate) Gluten (barley, oats, rye, and wheat) Artificial Food Colors (tartrazine and other Food Dye and Coloring Act [FD&C] dyes, which are derived from coal tar) Soy Lactose and other disaccharides Peanuts Nitrate and nitrites (found in preserved meats) Shellfish and phenylethylamine) Corn Salicylates - naturally occurring compounds found in many fruits, vegetables, some cheeses, herbs, spices, nuts, and medications such as aspirin Refined sugars (depends on source of sugar) NOTE: If a food causes you to have an immediate allergic reaction, such as throat swelling, a severe rash, or other severe allergy symptoms, seek medical care and avoid food challenges unless you are directly supervised by a physician. 4 Elimination Diet PATIENT HANDOUT University of Wisconsin Integrative Health www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative may be tolerated in small amounts, but not larger amounts. Keeping a careful food diary can be very helpful in identifying these foods. It is important to test with the purest form of food available. For example, to test wheat, use a pure wheat cereal that contains only wheat. You may use a non -dairy milk substitute like rice or ot her milk as long as that milk is not on your \"avoid\" list. Test milk and cheese on separate occasions. Different cheeses may be differently reactive or not, so best to test on separate occasions. Usually yogurt, cottage cheese, and butter do not need to be tested separately. For eggs, test the whites and yolks separately using hard -boiled eggs. Food challenges should be done as systematically as possible. Some c omponents of foods, such as the proteins casein and whey, and the sugar lactose in dairy can be s ystematically isolated by careful challenge planning. If you suspect a specific component of a food may be a culprit, try to work with a knowledgeable healthcare practitioner who can help you develop your plan. However, if you eliminate an entire food group, it may only be necessary to challenge with one or a few different foods from that group, not every unique food. As soon as a symptom returns, remove the food from the diet, make a note in the food diary and place that food on the \"allergic\" list. If you are unsure if you reacted to a food, remove it from your diet and re- test it in 4 -5 days. If a food doesn't cause symptoms during a challenge, it is unlikely to be a problem food and can eventually be added back into your diet. However, don't add the food back during this challenge period until you have completed the diet and the food challenges . In other words, go back off that food until you are done with challenges for all the foods you have eliminated. Step 4 - Creating A New, Long- Term Diet Based on your results, your health care practitioner can help you plan a way of eating to prevent your symptoms. Some things to keep in mind: This is not a perfect test. It can be confusing to tell for certain if a specific food is the cause. A lot of other factors (such as a stressful day at work) could interfere with the results. Try to keep things as constant as possible whi le you are on the diet. Some people have problems with more than one food. Be sure that you are getting adequate nutrition during the elimination diet and as you change your diet for the long- term. For example, if you give up dairy, you must supplement your calcium from other sources like green leafy vegetables. You may need to try several different elimination diets before you identify the problem foods. Most people tolerate this diet well, but if you cycle with the diet several times in an effort to narr ow in on the food culprits, your list of allowable foods may become increasingly small. If this happens and you find that you are becoming increasingly intolerant of, or losing enjoyment of eating, please consult a healthcare professional. You may be able to have some foods you are reactive to on an infrequent or rotational basis. Work with a knowledgeable healthcare practitioner, if possible, to understand how to plan for this. 5 Elimination Diet PATIENT HANDOUT University of Wisconsin Integrative Health www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative Table 2 Example of an Elimination Diet Calendar* *IMPORTANT : You only eat a new food for one to three days. Do not add it back into your meal plan again until the elimination diet is over. If a food causes a symptom, remove it immediately. Wait until your symptom completely disappears before challenging with the next food . Level 1: Simple (Modified) Elimination Diet (or dairy and gluten- free) This is the lowest intensity diet . There are two ways to do this. T he specific food, group, or additive depends on symptoms and suspected culprits. 1. Either just one food, one group of foods, or one food additive is eliminated See Table 1 for the most common food culprits. This is the easiest diet to follow, but if there are more than one food or groups of foods that cause symptoms, then t his diet may not prove useful. For suspected lactose intolerance, avoidance of just the dairy food group will be successful. Alternatively, lactase is the enzyme that digests the disaccharide lactose and can be obtained as an over -the-counter product. If eliminating lactose make symptoms disappear, dairy may still be enjoyed on occasion with the help of lactase. 2. Alternatively, the 2 most common food group culprits (dairy and wheat) are eliminated. The most common groups of food proteins that can cause i ntolerance are cow's milk protein and glutens from wheat.

Elimination Diet Strategies 6 Elimination Diet PATIENT HANDOUT University of Wisconsin Integrative Health www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative Eliminate all dairy products, including milk, cream, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, butter, ice cream, and frozen yogurt. Eliminate gluten, avoiding any foods that contain wheat, spelt, kamut, oats (certified gluten- free allowed) , rye, barley, or malt. This is the most important part of the diet. Substitute with brown rice, millet, buckwheat, quinoa, gluten- free flour products, or potatoes, tapioca and arrowroot products. Table 3 Simple (or Modified) Elimination Diet Level 2: Moderate Intensity Elimination Diet In a moderate intensity elimination diet, several foods or food groups are eliminated all at once. Ideally, the list of eliminated foods is individually tailored based on symptoms and suspected food culprits. For example, the low FODMaP diet may be a good choice for symptoms related to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) (see the FODMaP Diet handout ). A knowledgeable healthcare practitioner can help you identify specific food culprits for your condition or symptoms. Either follow the guidelines detailed below and in Table 4, or create a customized list. This version of the elimination diet may be more successful in eliminating symptoms because it will remove more suspected culprits all at once. The suggested moderate intensity elimination diet, in addition to dairy, and wheat, eliminates eggs, all legumes, nuts, some specific fruits and vegetables, artificial sweeteners, all animal fats, many vege tables fats, chocolate, coffee, tea, soft drinks, and alcohol. This diet may require a longer challenge period to identify the food culprits. Pay attention to the fact that it may be expensive to buy the foods recommended. Eliminate all animal protein, but if that is not possible or desirable, fish, poultry, and lamb are considered to be low allergy . Choose organic/free -range sources where available. Avoid alcohol and caffeine and all products that may contain these ingredients (including sodas, cold preparations, herbal tinctures). Avoid foods containing yeast or foods that promote yeast overgrowth, including processed foods, refined sugars, cheeses, commercially prepared condiments, peanuts, vinegar and alcoholic beverages. Avoid simple sugars such as candy, sweets and processed foods. Drink at least 2 quarts of water per day. Level 1 - Simple (Modified) Elimination Diet - eliminates dairy, and wheat Food Category Allowed Foods Eliminated Foods Animal proteins Beef, chicken, lamb, pork, turkey Dairy products Grains and Starches Arrowroot, barley, buckwheat, corn, millet, oats (gluten- free), rice, rye, sweet potato, tapioca, white potatoes, yams Wheat Oil Any non -dairy oils Dairy -based butter and margarines All fruits, vegetables, salt, spices, sweeteners, and vegetable proteins are allowed 7 Elimination Diet PATIENT HANDOUT University of Wisconsin Integrative Health www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative Table 4 Moderate Intensity Elimination Diet Level 3 The Few -Foods Diet In this very simplified diet, only a selec ted list of foods may be eaten. This diet should only be followed for a limited duration until the food culprits are discovered, to ensure that nutritional deficiencies do not occur. This diet is the strictest version and only the foods listed in Table 5 are e aten. Work with your healthcare practitioner , as able, to help you strategize the challenge phase . This is not a long -term diet as it is not nutritionally complete. It is important to add back the foods that do not cause symptoms once the elimination diet period is over to ensure adequate nutrition. Table 5 Few Foods Diet Level 2 - Moderate Intensity Elimination Diet - Eliminates several foods at once Food Category Allowed Foods Eliminated Foods Animal proteins Eliminate animal proteins entirely or include lamb, fish, or poultry (these animal proteins are considered low -allergenic, but some people can have sensitivities, so use with caution) All others, including eggs, milk, cheese, and all dairy Vegetable Proteins None Beans, bean sprouts, lentils, peanuts, peas, soy, all other nuts Grains and Starches Arrowroot, buckwheat , rice, sweet potato, tapioca, white , oats (gluten -free) Barley, millet, corn , rye, wheat Vegetables Most allowed Peas, tomatoes Fruits Most allowed No citrus or strawberries Sweeteners Cane or beet sugar, maple syrup Any others, including aspartame Oils Coconut, olive, safflower, sesame Animal fats (lard), butter, corn, margarine, shortening, soy, peanut, other vegetable oils Other Salt, pepper, a minimal number of spices, vanilla, lemon extract Chocolate, coffee, tea, colas and other soft drinks, alcohol Level 3 - The Few Foods Diet Only the foods in the table can be eaten.
