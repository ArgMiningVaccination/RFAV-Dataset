They consist of the following: Aromatherapy The use of essential oils - extracts or essences from flowers, herbs, and trees - is one of the oldest therapies, dating back 6,000 years to ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt. These oils are usually massaged into the skin, wafted in a room, or dissolved in a bath. Of our five primary senses, the olfactory is the only one that transmits information directly from the nose into the limbic center of the brain, these at of emotions and memory. Recent brain scan research has shown that different scents affect brainwave production; for example, with some increasing alpha (relaxation) waves and others affecting beta (alertness) waves. Aromatherapy is effective with many disorders, including stress, anxiety, pain, PMS, depression, certain types of male impotence, and many others. Principles of Aromatherapy: Ayurveda (\"Science of Life\" Traditional Medicine from India) is the oldest medical system. The focus on energy and balance rather than symptoms seeks to restore wholeness in the mind-body-spirit system. Disease is viewed as an outgrowth of mental conditions. Each person has a particular combination of physical, mental and emotional characteristics - distinct bioenergetic types known as Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - that are genetically determined and prenatally influenced. Different causes and treatments of physical and emotional disorders are based in part on this individual constitution, with the kind of patient being more important than the kind of symptoms. Physical and mental health is achieved by balancing diet, exercise, sleep, and sexual activity. Some of the tools of Ayurveda include a variety of stress management techniques, meditation, aromatherapy, yoga, and massage. Principles of Ayurveda: Chiropractic Chiropractic philosophy gravitates toward a holistic (\"total person\") approach to healing which combines elements of the mind, body and spirit and maintains that health depends on obedience to natural laws, and that deviation from such laws can result in illness. Principles of Chiropractic: Homeopathy Homeopathy is a system of natural medicine introduced and developed by a German physician, Samuel Hahnemann, at the end of the 18th century. Recognizing that the whole person-mind, body, spirit-is affected when there is illness, homeopathy seeks to treat that whole person. The focus is not the diseased part or the sickness, rather the totality of the individual. Principles of Homeopathy: The basic principle of homeopathy is that a substance that triggers a certain disease can also be used to treat that disease. This is referred to as the \"Law of Similars\". Native American Healing Is thousands of years old and combines religion, spirituality, herbal medicine, and rituals to treat medical and emotional problems, including trauma and addictions. Because there are hundreds of tribal nations, the practices vary, but generally include purifying ceremonies, chants, sweat lodge, and other tribal customs. Healing rituals can last for minutes, days or weeks and may involve a combination of dance, chanting, body painting, and prayer. Principles of Native American Healing: Naturopathy Naturopathy, or naturopathic medicine, is a system of medicine based on the healing power of nature. Naturopathy is a holistic system, meaning that naturopathic doctors (N.D.s) or naturopathic medical doctors (N.M.D.s) strive to find the cause of disease by understanding the body, mind, and spirit of the person. Principles of Naturopathy: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) In use for more than 4,000 years, is based on the flow of vital energy (qi or chi, pronounced \"chee\") throughout the body. In a healthy state, the yin and yang (negative and positive energies) are balanced, while a disease state results from an imbalance. Thus, the use of herbs, nutrition, meditation, acupuncture, and exercise are intended to restore balance and return the body, mind/emotions and spirit to health. Principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Please note that Dr. Huntoon has spent countless days and years studying and practicing the different philosophies listed above. By incorporating these different philosophies into his own life and bringing them to his practice for over 27 years, he is happy to share his expertise with you to support your healing process. Appreciating that there are other philosophies associated with helping a body to heal and maintain balance, including and not limited to massage, Reiki, physical therapy, light therapy and sound therapy, etc., Dr. Huntoon offers his understandings of these philosophies and modalities additionally. All of these modalities focus on the primary effect of the imbalances and diseases we experience, which manifest at the physical level. And you will note that within the principles of each Non-Allopathic or Alternative philosophy, there are different focuses on the effects as experienced by the individual, as well as those that focus specifically on the underlying cause, as it pertains to the physical. The benefit of applying these practices are they will truly empower the individual and help them discover their higher power and their purpose for incarnating into physicality, while restoring balance at a soul level. We intend to restore balance to the body, mind AND spirit to facilitate healing of the Triune-Being. Since most people reading this are coming from a Western Philosophy, they may be less inclined to think of helping our spirit/soul and may feel there aren't things we would need to do related to a spiritual/soul imbalance. And as the energy frequencies continue to increase, that philosophy is beginning to change; hence why we are offering Metaphysical Healing. Having experienced all of these forms of healing as a student and a patient, Our goal by offering this form of care is to enhance the balancing within each person we support through their process. And as Triune-Beings, it is important for all of us to restore balance to our Triune-Self. What Are The Tools We Use for Metaphysical Healing? We look at the body from 7 different perspectives in supporting the body as a whole. Through each of these perspectives, we employ several different tools and techniques, many of which overlap, in an effort to bring the highest level of balance to the individual in the shortest amount of time. These include as many as 30 different healing techniques that have been blended together to support the individual to restore balance within all 7 different perspectives. Since this is a co-creative experience, this allows the individual to learn about their process of discovering their specific imbalances, the relationships associated with each imbalance and the understanding of what the source of the dysfunction is; Additionally while learning how to remove the underlying cause, the individual is returned back to balance and harmony. And once there, each individual will learn how to maintain that level of balance for themselves, while helping others achieve that same type of balance for their lives. And all of it is based on the Law of One. The Law of One is the comprehension that all things are made of intelligent energy and are a part of the All-One. The Law of One is a Sacred Science of the mechanics of Christ Consciousness and are the Natural Laws governing our Universal Creation. All-One is the recognition that Eternal Truth is Eternal Love and Eternal Love is the organic consciousness of Infinite Creator, or God. Eternal Love consciousness embodied in a form is Unity intelligence, and simultaneously recognized as, the Inner Light of Christos. Unity consciousness is at One with God and Unity consciousness ignites the Inner Light of Christos. The Inner Light of Christos, when actualized in form, is the embodiment of an Eternal God Human. Practice Unity Consciousness and One is directly reflecting the image of God's Love, and is eternally protected. Be At One with All, as One is All with God. Every soul is taking the same journey, but each soul has evolved at a different level. The teachings of the Law of One describe the spiritual laws that govern our spiritual evolution for each dimension. It is a single philosophical system of World Humanism, which merges cosmology, science, Human Rights and spiritualism. Simply put, There are 4 Fundamental Questions we all would choose to answer at some point on our spiritual journey/the journey of the Soul. Who am I? Where am I? Why am I where I am? What do I intend to do about that? A summary of All 4 Fundamental Questions can be stated as, Why am I in the space? Am I here to serve a spiritual agenda, both for myself in terms of how I show up, as well as for the people I am interacting with, AND, how might that look? Consider, \"I am here for a reason that transcends the physicality of the moment.\" This statement drives directly to the question, What is the purpose of life itself? And what is the purpose of this moment, interior to the larger agenda? Thank You for your consideration and We look forward to serving you!
