Most cases resolve within 2 to 4 weeks. This rare disease was found mainly in central and western African countries. Cases without international travel or contact with imported animals have been recently reported indicating spread of this infection. Mpox was previously called \"monkeypox.\" Alternative Names Poxvirus; Orthopoxvirus; Monkeypox Causes Mpox was first detected in Denmark in 1958 in a colony of monkeys used for research. This is how it first came to be called \"monkeypox.\" The name was changed to mpox to reduce stigma and associated with the previous name. The first human case of mpox occurred in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Since May 2022, cases of mpox have been reported in countries where mpox does not normally occur. These include countries in Europe, North and South America, the Middle East, and Australia. Mpox is caused by Orthopoxvirus. It is similar to the virus that causes smallpox, but is much less severe. The virus is transmitted when a person comes into close contact with an infected animal, human, or material contaminated with the virus. Mpox can be transmitted from animal to human when a person: Comes in contact with an infected animal Gets bitten or scratched by an infected animal Handles or consumes bushmeat People with mpox can spread the virus to animals, such as pets and livestock. Mpox can be transmitted from human to human through close contact, such as: Direct skin-to-skin contact with body fluids, sores, rash, or scabs from an infected person Touching objects, clothing, linens, or surfaces used by a person with mpox Exposure to large respiratory droplets Mpox can be transmitted from human to human during intimate contact, including: Oral, anal, and vaginal sex Touching the genitals or anus of an infected person Hugging, kissing, cuddling, and massaging Face-to-face contact Touching fabrics or objects during sex that were used by a person with mpox such as bedding, towels, and sex toys A pregnant person can spread the virus to their fetus through the placenta. Symptoms Symptoms usually appear in 1 to 3 weeks after exposure. A rash appears that can be found on or near the genitals and can appear on all parts of the body. The rash starts as flat spots that become raised bumps, which fill with fluid, then pus. The bumps may be painful. Soon they crust over and form itchy scabs that fall off and heal over. Flu-like symptoms include: Fever Chills Swollen lymph nodes Muscle aches Backache Headache Fatigue Sore throat, runny nose, or cough You may experience all or just some of the symptoms. You may have flu-like symptoms followed by the rash in 1 to 4 days You may get the rash first, then the flu-like symptoms Or you may just have the rash Mpox lasts about 2 to 4 weeks. You are no longer contagious only after: All symptoms are gone Scabs have healed completely New skin has formed Exams and Tests Your health care provider can diagnose mpox by looking at the rash and asking questions about your medical history. Your provider may take specimens from your skin lesions and send them for testing. A PCR test (polymerase chain reaction test) can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment Currently, there is no specific treatment for the mpox virus. In most people, symptoms usually go on their own in 2 to 4 weeks. Certain people may be at risk for more severe disease and may need to be hospitalized and given supportive care: People with severe symptoms People whose immune system is not working well People who are pregnant or breastfeeding Children younger than 8 years old Antivirals used for smallpox may be helpful in treating mpox in people who are more likely to get severely ill. Home care for mpox can help prevent the spread and keep you more comfortable. Do not pop or scratch the lesions and do not shave the area. Avoid touching the rash, as you can spread it to other parts of the body. Cover lesions with bandages or gauze to help prevent spreading the virus. Try over-the-counter (OTC) topical products such as benzocaine/lidocaine for pain and calamine lotion or petroleum jelly for itching. OTC oral antihistamines may also help with itching. An oatmeal bath may help with itching. Using a sitz bath or sitting in shallow water in the tub can help with lesions on the genitals. Epsom salt, vinegar, or baking soda can be added to the water to help soothe the area. Keep the area dry and clean (except when washing). Wash your hands often with soap and water or sanitizer, especially after touching the rash. For a rash on your hands, wear comfortable gloves when touching surfaces or objects in shared spaces. Wear a well-fitting face mask around other people until all of your symptoms are gone and your skin is healed. OTC pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help relieve pain. Your health care provider may prescribe something stronger, if needed. Outlook (Prognosis) In most people, symptoms go away within 2 to 4 weeks. Rarely, severe cases may lead to death.
