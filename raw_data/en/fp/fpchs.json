Wishing you the most healthful year ever! Helen Eddy, Assistant Vice Pres ident Health & WellnessLetter 02-03 Fresh at Hy-Vee hy-vee.comOS Winning the War TEXT COURTENAY WOLF PHOTOGRAPHY TOBIN BENNETT You want your kids to be healthy, but sometimes you worry about whether they're getting the right foods or enough physical activity. You're right to be concerned. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), since 1980 the prevalence of obesity has doubled in children ages 6 to 11, rising to 17 percent, and tripled in adolescents 12 to 19, rising to 17.6 percent. Kids with poor eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are at greater risk for T ype 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease and depression. PARENTS AS CHANGE AGENTS The good news is that parents can change the trend and lead by example. Ellyn Satter, M.S., R.D., author of Your Child's Weight, Helping Without Harming (2005), believes the place to start is with feeding kids. \"Maintain a division of responsibility,\" she says. \"Parents do the what, when and where of feeding; children do the how much and whether of eating.\" As counterintuitive as it may seem, controlling portion size is not the answer. Satter says research shows that kids with parents who limit portion sizes during meals and snacks, or focus on making kids eat \"some of everything,\" are more likely to be overweight. And beware of labeling kids. \"Children who are labeled obese and overweight feel fl awed in every way\u2014not smart, not physically capable and not worthy,\" says Satter. The solution is providing structure and choice. \"Parents maintain the structure of meals and snacks and do not let the child graze between times,\" counsels Satter. \"That means no food or beverage handouts\u2014except water\u2014between scheduled snacks and meals.\" It doesn't mean making kids go hungry or denying them their favorite treats occasionally, but kids choose from selections that parents make available. The number of obese and overweight kids continues to increase. To improve their long-term health, parental intervention is needed. A few simple rules to live by can get kids and parents back on track toward a long life of wellness. RECOMMIT TO SHARED MEALS With today's busy schedules, it's sometimes hard to nd time for family meals. But research shows that kids who sit down to eat meals with their families make healthier food choices, do better in school and are less likely to get into trouble. Satter advises starting where you are and doing the best you can. Even if you've picked up takeout and have only 20 minutes to eat before delivering your child to practice, she recommends sitting down at the table, turning off the TV, computer and cell phones and eating together. \"Without putting a lot of pressure on yourself, the next thing you know the quality will get better,\" she says. But you don't have to go it alone. If you've hit the wall on easy, nutritious meals or need to better understand how to provide a healthful diet for your family, Hy-Vee dietitians can help. Melody Cole, a registered dietitian at the Overland Park, Kansas, Hy-Vee, regularly meets with customers for grocery store tours. \"I guide them through the store and show them different products, let them taste the foods and share ideas on incorporating them into easy meals. It's a different look at the grocery store.\" Cole also meets one-on-one with customers and in classes to help meal planners develop strategies to manage weight. UP THE ACTIVITY LEVEL Eating is only half the story. Maintaining a healthy weight is all about creating an energy balance\u2014balancing calories consumed with calories expended. And accomplishing balance requires plenty of physical activity. According to the CDC, kids need at least 60 minutes of vigorous activity every day\u2014in 10- to 15-minute segments\u2014which should include bone- and muscle-building activities as well as aerobic exercise. Encourage jumping rope, 04-11 Winning the War.indd health 2010HY-VEE JOINS THE FIGHT \"For the rst time in 100 years, children today have a shorter life expectancy than their parents,\" says Dr. William J. Klish, professor of pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine. That's a shocking statement, and it explains why Hy-Vee has joined 40 of the nation's leading retailers, food and beverage manufacturers, and nonpro t organizations in an effort to reduce obesity (especially childhood obesity) in the United States by the year 2015. The group established the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation and has already committed $20 million to obesity-reduction projects. \"While it may seem like an impossible goal\u2014 to reverse a 20-year increase in obesity in ve years\u2014we don't think it is,\" says Ric Jurgens, CEO and President of Hy-Vee. \"We think together we can actually change the world, and we have to.\" The group is partnering with leading nonpro ts to develop and invest in programs that work. To measure whether the programs are actually reducing obesity, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, one of the most respected health research organizations in the country, will provide an independent evaluation and then publish the results. EMPHASIS ON KIDSHy-Vee dietitians alerted Jurgens and other company leaders to a pilot program in Kansas City, the Healthy Schools Partnership (HSP). HSP brings together PE4Life\u2014a program that has remade the traditional PE class to engage all kids, not just the athletically inclined\u2014with swinging, organized sports, riding bikes, climbing, running, playing, dancing, ball games, tag and other active games\u2014whatever it takes to get kids moving while having fun. Adults need vigorous exercise too, at least 30 minutes a day. The double bene t is that by getting up and moving, you become a role model. \"Recognizing that, as parents, you are mentors and whatever pattern you show paints a picture for your kids is vital,\" says Kuda Chimaya, M.P.H., M.S., R.D., L.D., head coach and program director for the Healthy Schools Partnership in Kansas City. This pilot program, a partnership of the American Council for Fitness and Nutrition Foundation, the American Dietetic Association Foundation and PE4Life, refocuses the traditional physical education registered dietitians who coach kids in groups and one on one. HSP is a cooperative effort of the American Dietetic Association Foundation, the American Council for Fitness and Nutrition and PE4Life. \"We went to visit schools in Kansas City and what we saw was phenomenal,\" sa ys Jurgens. \"The kids were having fun using stair-steppers, Wii Fit and other state-of-the art technology to get their heart rates up to a target level. They were learning about nutrition and energy balance too\u2014calories in, calories out\u2014with games and activities. Ev erybody was up and moving and having fun.\" NUMBERS TELL THE STORY The results have been impressive. In the rst year of PE4Life at Woodland Elementary in Kansas City, the number of students in the healthy tness zone for strength increased by 433 percent, and in cardiovascular tness the number increased by 207 percent. Students showed measurable improvement in nutrition knowledge and made more healthful food choices at lunch and at home. The bene ts of the program are evident in other areas of school. Disc ipline incidents dropped 67 percent, and the number of suspension days was cut by two-thirds. In Naper ville, Illinois, schools that adopted PE4Life (pairing exercise with learning) showed increases in reading and math scores among students. \"Exercise is like Miracle-Gro for the brain,\" says Dr. John Ratey, Harvard Medical School brain specialist. He was so impressed by the results of PE4Life that he featured the program and its results in the rst chapter of his book, Spark, The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain (2008). The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation is supporting a 3-year pilot project. The HSP program is being rolled out to four schools in each of three communities: Washington D.C., Kansas City and Des Moines, and also to a tribal community in Iowa and to a school in Chicago. Hy-Vee registered dietitians will be working with HSP partners to provide nutrition education to schools in Iowa. Jurgens was so enthusiastic about wh at he saw in Kansas City that he shared it with his fellow business associates in Iowa. The result is that the Iowa Business Council will use the PE4Life Adopt-a-School Challenge to scale up the HSP model, with the goal of implementing it in 50 Iowa schools within 5 years. EDUCATING ADULTS The Healthy Weight Commitment will also emphasize helping customers and employees make choices that support their long-term health. Hy-Vee is introducing the \"Naturally Slim\" program to help its employees make healthy choices. In the future, the company will then roll out the program to customers. \"Food industry leaders believe that we have a unique opportunity and an obligation to help ght this obesity epidemic because we sell the food that people eat every day,\" says Jurgens. \"At the end of the day, it's about education and programs that work in helping people change their lives so they aren't candidates for life-altering diseases.\" class toward fun tness activities. Pairing a nutrition coach with a PE teacher, the program ensures that kids get one-on-one coaching while tracking progress in tness levels and food choices. Hy-Vee, through participation in the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation\u2014partnership of 40 of the nation's leading retailers, food and beverage manufacturers and nonpro t organizations\u2014 supports this program and others designed to reduce obesity in the United States by the year 2015.

PROBLEM: Too much screen time. The No. 1 after-school activity for kids is watching TV. Kids between 8 and 18 watch nearly 4 hours a day, not counting time with DVDs, computer, online chats and texting, which can push media time as high as 8 hours a day.SOLUTION: Set a screen-time budget. One to two hours a day is plenty, and let kids decide how to spend it. Place screens where you can see what's watched. Research shows that kids with TVs in their rooms spend up to 1.5 hours more time watching each day. PROBLEM: Too little physical activ ity. Kids m iss out on tness when they plop in front of a screen. SOLUTION: Create a plan. Brainstorm a list of fun activities to get moving in 10- to 15-minute segments: rope-jumping, swinging, dancing, playing tag, bike-riding or running and playing. Or nd active after-school programs. Exercise with kids every week. PROBLEM: Picky eaters. \"My kids don't like/won't eat ... .\" SOLUTION: Kuda Chimaya says it just isn't so. She's found with kids in the Healthy Schools program that when food is there, kids eat it. Give them a healthful variety and let them decide how much to eat and whether to try something. \"Typically children will choose one, two or three items,\" says Ellyn Satter. \"Parents should not encourage a child to eat more or try to get her to eat less than she wants.\" PROBLEM: Snacking on high-fat or high-sugar foods that diminish mealtime appetites. SOLUTION: Stock only the snack foods you want kids to have access to. Limit snack times and set a good example. PROBLEM: Mindless munching while watching TV or playing. SOLUTION: Limit eating to speci c times and speci c places, without the interference of TV or other distractions. Encourage an occasional short wait until mealtime. Sit at a table or counter, making snack time also a social time. PROBLEM: Skipping breakfast or eating only on the run. SOLUTION: Research shows that kids who eat a nutritious breakfast do better in school and have fewer behavior problems. Make time for breakfast, perhaps getting up 15 minutes earlier. Offer options and ask what kids would like to eat, letting them help shop for or plan the meal. Offer a combination that includes protein, carbohydrates and dairy.

TEXT KATHY BARNES PHOTOGRAPHY KING AUIndulge in these recipe remakes that turn kid-favorite foods into more healthful fare. Then learn how a few substitutions will have your entire family clamoring for g ood-for-you foods that don't skimp on taste. 12-19 Let them eat cake.indd reported recently about the bene ts of healthy eating and living. People who consume whole grains and plenty of nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables bene t from stronger bodies, sharper minds, a positive outlook and so much more. The challenge is how to get kids to eat these healthful foods\u2014when often they have already developed a taste for highly processed, empty-calorie ller foods. For starters, Heidi Boyd, a Hy-Vee home economist, says to inspire children to try more with a simple renaming strategy. \"Children eat with their eyes and ears,\" says Boyd, the mom of two young children, Maisie, 1, and Ross, 4. \"I live with picky eaters, so I make healthy eating more appealing by giving foods a fun name and even by making those foods fun to look at.\" She says her children turned up their noses at broccoli and peas. Yet they found those same vegetables tasty when she renamed them \"princess peas\" and \"dinosaur trees.\" She employs other techniques as well, such as cutting sandwiches in surprising shapes and serving full-size portions as bite-size nger foods. Her tactics help kids get over the new-food hurdles, but teaching healthy eating isn't an all-vegetables-no-cake proposition. It's good to strike a balance, and that can be done by updating recipes to increase ber, lower fat and calories, and incr ease vitamins and minerals\u2014making use of simple substitutions. For example, rice cereal-marshmallow bars become more healthful by mixing in such whole-grain cereals as MultiGrain Cheerios. It's a win-win: Good nutrition for kids and rewarding feelings for parents when they see kids eating foods that are good for them. 12-19 Let them eat cake.indd 1312-19 seasons health 2010Makes wheat fl our 34 cup Hy-Vee all-purpose fl our 1 teaspoon Hy-Vee baking soda 14 teaspoon Hy-Vee salt 13 cup Hy-Vee cocoa powder 14 cup Hy-Vee canola oil 1 (2.25 oz.) container baby food prunes 112 cups Splenda sugar blend, divided 23 cup Hy-Vee skim milk 1 teaspoon Hy-Vee white vinegar 14 cup Hy-Vee half-and-half 2 oz. unsweetened chocolate, chopped 12 tablespoon Hy-Vee unsalted butter Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.

To prepare ganache, heat half-and-half and remaining \u00bd cup sugar blend in a small saucepan over medium-high heat just until mixture begins to boil. Turn off heat; add unsweetened chocolate. Whisk thoroughly until chocolate is melted. Add butter and stir until smooth. Dip the tops of the cupcakes into the ganache.

If you want to bake a batch of cookies using whole-wheat fl our, it's best to use half the amount of whole wheat fl our. For example, when a recipe calls for one cup of all-purpose (regular, white) fl our, use one-half cup of whole wheat fl our plus one-half cup of all-purpose fl our. Recipes that call for vegetable oil are often just as moist made with applesauce as a substitute. Naturally tangy plain yogurt works to make dressings or sauces in recipes that call for mayonnaise or sour cream. For more substitutions, visit www.hy-vee.com. For cooks who frequently do dinnertime battle with picky eaters, Boyd says it's okay to get clever. She's been known to add butternut squash to mac-and-cheese or a small jar of baby food, such as a green vegetable, to pizza sauce. \"As long as the texture and color is right, kids will be accepting. It's a clever way to deliver new fl avors that kids might otherwise object to,\" Boyd says, and she doesn't see it as cheating when she's providing good nutrition. Once children accept the taste and texture of new foods, it's time to have conversations about what good foods do for growing and learning. \"When kids are little, telling them that a calcium-rich food makes their teeth or bones stronger will do,\" she says. \"You can get more in-depth on nutrients and the importance of feeding your body as the child gets older and is able to understand more.\" More than simply nourishing bodies, preparing homemade meals together teaches lifelong skills and bonds families in ways that few other activities can. Begin while your children are young. Toddlers can stir ingredients, go to the fridge to nd ingredients, garnish food on plates and set the table. Con dent preschoolers can begin to learn to use a microwave oven with supervision and assist with basic cooking techniques, such as measuring, pouring liquid ingredients and cracking eggs. In the process, children learn about kitchen tools by using rubber scrapers and wire whisks, which let them get into the action. \"It might be messy, but look at it as an opportunity to infl uence your child's relationship with food,\" Boyd says. Kitchens are classrooms for learning as kids read directions and learn about math, especially fractions. \"Help your child understand why you need both a half-cup measure and one-fourth cup measure to equal three-fourths cup, and you're teaching math,\" Boyd says. And the science of food can inspire awe: \"So much of cooking is about chemical reactions between ingredients,\" she says. To razzle-dazzle kids, show them what happens when they mix baking soda and vinegar. For people who argue that cooking a meal at home takes too long, Boyd suggests following a weekly menu plan. This tried-and-true remedy keeps family meals on track and makes the most of grocery store trips. \"If you get to four o'clock in the afternoon and realize you don't know what's for dinner, it's easy to fall back on quick- x convenience foods or a drive-through,\" she says. \"So even if you like healthful foods, it can be a challenge to get a healthy meal pulled together when you don't have the ingredients on hand.\" To ease the time crunch on busy nights, have packages of cut-up, ready-to-serve or ready-to-cook carrots, broccoli, snapped peas, and other vegetables on hand. \"Washed and ready to go, these foods will shortcut the meal process,\" she says. Also involve your children with menu planning. Ask them to look through cookbooks and food magazines with you, then take them along to help shop for groceries. As children walk the aisles, they have an opportunity to weigh in on what they like. Children are more receptive to a variety of foods and meals when they've been involved with the planning and preparation. Aside from raising a healthy child, eating at home builds a healthy family. \"You know what your children are putting into their bodies and you obviously save a lot of money by eating at home,\" she says. \"But look at mealtime as an investment in your family. It's the one opportunity during the day where you can gather and spend quality time talking about the highs and lows of the day, sharing really important moments that could otherwise slip away. It's important to come together. If you're not doing that, dinner is a good place to start.

With less time than ever, it's all too easy to turn to fast food or skip lunch entirely. The solution is to pack your own nutritious, portable provisions for one satisfying way to ensure a healthful midday 2010Leisurely lunches may be a thing of the past, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the meal. Packing your lunch is a great way to save calories and money; time and fuel are also saved because you won't be driving to a restaurant or ghting lunch crowds. Plus, if you follow a specialty diet or are concerned about extra fat and calories, preparing your own lunch makes it easy to stick to a healthy plan. PACK A POWERFUL PUNCH Suzanne Farrell, registered dietitian and spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association, says every good lunch should include a few basics: protein, whole grains, fruits/vegetables and, if possible, a low-fat dairy source. \"Carbohydrates are good for snacking, but to keep your metabolic rate up throughout the day and to avoid late afternoon vending machine raids, be sure to include a protein source with each meal and eat regularly\u2014every three to four hours.\" Stacy Mitchell, Hy-Vee dietitian, Bettendorf, Iowa, agrees. \"Lean deli meats (10 grams of fat or less) make great sandwiches, but don't forget those bits of leftover beef, chicken and pork; they make wonderful toss-ins for salads and soups. And you can never go wrong with placing a little tuna or an extra salmon llet over a bed of greens,\" she says. \"It's an economical way to use up leftovers\u2014just three to four ounces for an entire serving of protein in a snap.\" Foods rich in both protein and ber make great companions. They are lling and can easily be incorporated into a healthy lunch. Ready-to-eat salad blends are even more nutritious when beans, seeds or hard-boiled eggs are added. A sandwich spread with hummus, instead of dressings, blends perfectly with other wholesome ingredients, such as roasted peppers and sprouts. AVOID BROWN BAG BOREDOM Lunches should be tasty and tempting\u2014new twists on old standbys keep you from straying from your healthy path. Prepare tuna or chicken salad with balsamic vinegar and olive oil instead of mayonnaise, and then eat it with whole grain crackers or serve over greens. Weave in additional nutrients with a side of vegetables or a piece of fruit and you have a delicious and nutritious lunch. Colorful, crunchy vegetables are good choices for sides and snacking. But branch out a bit and get creative. Try jicama instead of baby carrots, or thread vegetables or fruits onto toothpicks for mini kabobs. Stocking up on healthful sides is easy with a trip to the Hy-Vee salad bar, where you can purchase serving sizes of fruits and vegetables already cleaned, cut, and ready to eat or pack. REVAMP AND REUSE Giving your lunch a makeover offers you many nutritional bene ts, but those convenient single-use plastic bags, aluminum foil or paper bags could all end up in the land ll. Do something good for your body as well as the environment by choosing reusable lunch containers, stainless-steel forks and spoons, cloth napkins and eco-friendly lunch bags, such as the many stylish and fun options available at your Hy-Vee.

As a result, many consumers have turned to a gluten-free diet. Is shunning gluten really necessary? According to the Gluten Intolerance Group of North America (www.gluten.net), only 1% of the population may have been diagnosed with celiac disease, the most severe form of gluten intolerance. For this group, and for those who have gluten sensitivity, symptoms range from mild gastrointestinal upset to serious health problems, and a gluten-free diet is the only treatment. \"Although there is a fad aspect to a gluten-free diet, the trend has been good for those who are truly intolerant and for those who want a gluten-free version of their favorite foods,\" says Stacy Mitchell, Hy-Vee dietitian, Bettendorf, Iowa. \"Consumers need to understand that gluten-free isn't necessarily fat free or calorie free; they should choose wisely when making substitutions.\" Mitchell recommends perusing the Hy-Vee HealthMarket aisles for a wide range of natural, gluten-free products, including snack foods and baked goods, quick-and-easy meal solutions\u2014such as soups and frozen entr\u00e9es Hy-Vee HealthMarket: ber, psyllium or colon cleanse 100, 120 or 160 ct. 50% off Hy-Vee HealthMarket Children's Vitamins: selected varieties 60 to 300 ct. 50% offBlue Diamond Nut Thins: selected varieties 4.25 oz. $2.29 Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Oats: steel cut 24 oz. or rolled 32 oz. $4.99 Food for Life Gluten Free Bread: selected varieties 24 oz. $4.48 Hodgson Mill Gluten Free Pasta: selected varieties 8 oz. $2.69 for portable lunches. \"With new product selections frequently added, Hy-Vee makes it easier than ever to m aintain a gluten-free diet,\" Mitchell says.

Foods containing ber are rich in phytonutrients\u2014chemicals made by plants that have antioxidant and disease- ghting properties. A diet high in ber (25 to 35 grams per day) promotes good digestive health, lowers cholesterol and helps to maintain a healthy weight. Fiber also helps keep blood sugar\u2014and hunger levels\u2014steady throughout the day. Fiber supplements are not usually necessary if you eat a wide variety of ber-rich foods each day. Although some foods tout \"added ber,\" loading your lunch box with natural ber sources remains the best choice because of the additional nutrients and heart-healthy omega-3 fats that they provide. Start by swapping some of your favorite foods with high- ber choices. Munch carrots or whole grain crackers instead of chips with your lunchtime sandwich. Sprinkle a tablespoon or two of fl axseeds or chia seeds on salads or in yogurt or smoothies. Make whole grain bread or to rtillas the b asis of yo ur sandwich. Or fo rgo lunch meat and replace it with sprouts, tomatoes, cucumbers and other delicious vegetables. And remember: Fiber and water go hand in hand\u2014be sure to drink plenty.

Do blueberries trump bananas? Are frozen and canned green beans equal to fresh? You may be surprised. Angela Lahr is nding grocery shopping and selecting the most nutritious foods for her family much easier these days. Angela is utilizing the NuVal nutrition scoring system available at all Hy-Vee stores. She has a ve-year-old son and an infant, and nutrition has always been a priority for her. Now, with the NuVal system, she can make wise decisions\u2014con dently and quickly. \"I'd heard about it, then was doing some research about it online and discovered how easy it is to work with. With two children in tow when I go to the store, I don't have time to read labels closely. NuVal makes it quick and easy.\" NuVal began as a joint venture in 2008 by Topco Associates and Grif n Hospital based in Braintree, Maryland. Programs have been developed for retailers and manufacturers, including Hy-Vee, to make shopping for nutritious foods easier. \"NuVal was created speci cally to answer the rising tide of health problems, such as obesity and heart disease, in Americans,\" says Annette Maggi, NuVal's senior nutritionist. \"We have more nutrition information at our ngertips than ever before, but as a nation, we're unhealthier than ever. Confusion is the issue\u2014consumers don't know how to make sense of confusing nutrition fact panels, ingredient lists, and other package labeling that call out certain attributes yet ignore others. With NuVal, consumers can deal simply with one number between 1 and 100.\" NuVal has rated more than 30,000 products so far; the resulting scores are shown on the shelf tags near the items. The NuVal system measures nutrient density, examining more than 30 nutrients considered to be healthful\u2014such as ber, folate and vitamins. Those nutrients are rated along with less nutrient-rich ingredients, such as sugar, sodium and trans fats. First, nutrients provided are measured to calories. Salmon, for example, has plenty of omega-3 fatty acids to protect against heart disease, little saturated fat and sodium, no trans fats and plenty of potassium and protein. A four-ounce serving, with all those bene ts, has only 165 calories. Salmon, at 82, is high scoring especially in the seafood category. Some food rating systems, sponsored by food companies, allow for potential bias. David Katz, former director of medical studies in public health at the Yale School of Medicine, however, deliberately designed NuVal outside the food industry to keep the system objective and independent. This system is easy to learn. Angela's ve-year-old, Kayden, likes to nd big numbers. \"We've been working with Kayden on learning numbers, so this has multiple bene ts,\" Angela says. As Kayden locates numbers, he also has fun choosing good food. \"He may not always want the foods with high numbers. He still likes sugary snacks, like other kids, and I don't mind giving him snacks every once in a while, but at least he's learning the difference.\" Cereal scores are especially intriguing to Angela. \"I just assumed that the cereals he likes would be high in calories and full of sugar. Surprisingly we found some that rate well are his favorites, such as Honey Nut Cheerios, which SERVICES Did you know that you can get one-on- one nutritional counseling right in your neighborhood Hy-Vee store? Anne Cundiff, R.D., L.D. is a certi ed wellness coach at the Fleur Drive store in Des Moines. \"We're here for our customers to help them make healthy decisions in the place where it has the most impact on their daily eating habits\u2014the grocery store.\" Cundiff says she is beginning to see more clients individually, and that she also gets out in the aisles often to interact with customers and help them navigate the NuVal system. Julie Gieseman, R.D., L.D., C.D.E. (certi ed diabetes educator) is at the Valley West store in West Des Moines, Iowa. Her services include individual nutrition counseling, weight loss programs and personal shopping tours. A recent scheduled store tour focused on identifying the best choices for diabetics. The NuVal system is explained in tours and in counseling sessions. \"I show customers how to make the best choice within a food category. Sometimes claims on food packaging can lead to wrong choices. People hear that they should eat more whole grains, they go to the bread aisle and look at the labels, which can be misleading. The NuVal system helps clear up confusion.\" If you are interested in scheduling an appointment with a Hy-Vee dietitian you can go to www.hy-vee.com, click on Find a Dietitian, and locate a store that offers the services you are looking for. If you don't have access to a computer, simply stop at the customer service counter at your neighborhood Hy-Vee and ask to set up an appointment. \"Or ask any employee in the aisles,\" Gieseman says. \"They all know how to access our schedules and can help set up something.\" Services vary among stores, so check with your nearest store to see which services are available. Some Hy-Vee dietitian services are free, others require FOODS In the NuVal Rating system, in which scores range from 1 to 100, Hy-Vee nutritionists advise to compare scores within a category rather than, for example, fresh vegetables to cereals. \"You won't nd 100 in every aisle,\" says Anne certi ed wellness coach at the Fleur Drive Hy-Vee in Des Moines. \"One hundred is the highest, but the system doesn't allow for adding for a daily goal,\" she says. Heather Illg, R.D., L.D., at the Urbandale and Johnston, Iowa, Hy-Vee stores, shows customers how to compare foods within a category. \"For example, in soups, you may be surprised that an old standby, such as tomato soup, scores low because of the high sodium, she says. \"To nd a better choice, a higher number, in the soup category, look for broth-based, low-sodium options with vegetables and whole grains, such as rice or barley.\" In every category, Illg advises, try to trade up. With bread, for example, where a range between 25 and 35 is good, look for ber and whole grains. Low-calorie (light) breads score higher because NuVal measures the most nutrition for the least amount of calories. Some white bread scores relatively high because nutrients are added. Note that canned and frozen green beans score as high as fresh. \"As long as no salt or other ingredient is added\u2014green beans score 100,\" says Annette Maggi, NuVal's senior nutritionist. \"Canning or freezing do not lower nutrition value; added salt or a high-calorie sauce would affect the score.\" SOME FOODS THAT SCORE 100: ApricotsAsparagusBlueberriesBroccoliKiwifruitLettuce (green leaf, red leaf and Romaine)OrangesHodgson Mill Unprocessed Wheat BranBirds Eye Frozen Chopped SpinachBirds Eye Frozen Tender Broccoli Green Giant Frozen Cut Green Beans Del Monte Fresh Cut French-Style green beans (no salt added) Previously Frozen Ahi Tuna Steaks per lb. $7.99 Tender Green Asparagus per lb. $2.48 Celestial Seasonings Tea: selected varieties 18, 20 or 40 ct. 2/$5.00 General Mills Cereals: selected varieties 10.9 to 18 oz. $2.98 Horizon Organic Milk: selected varieties 64 oz. $3.99 Dole Fresh Cut Veggies: selected varieties 12 oz. 3/$5.00 8th Continent Soymilk: selected varieties 64 oz. $2.67 the numbers.Shopping by The higher the Nuval Score, the Triathlete: \"Triathlon is part of a lifestyle that has empowered me to live healthier and go beyond what I thought possible.\" 30 seasons health 2010THE THRILL 30-35 Thrill of the PM31 seasons hy-vee.com OF THE RACE TEXT JENNY WEBER AND PEG SMITH PHOTOGRAPHY TOBIN BENNETT AND STEVE FRYNearly a million people each year participate in multisport events that range from sprint distance triathlons to such well-known races as the Ironman. It's no different in the Midwest, where this multisport challenge has become extremely popular. Athletes at nearly every tness level compete in triathlons yearly, proving to themselves that when they commit their minds and bodies, anything is possible. In the dawn of a warm summer morning, So Yong Newman set off to nish her rst Hy-Vee Triathlon. Along with 1,600 age group athletes from 43 states, she swam, biked and ran her way to the nish line of the fastest-growing participatory sport on the planet. For this 43-year-old salon owner from Clive, Iowa, and mother of three, triathlon has become part of her life. Encouraged by family, she entered the 2008 Hy-Vee Triathlon as part of a relay team, nishing the bike portion, and she was hooked. \"I love the energy and all the encouraging spectators, volunteers and athletes out there,\" says So Yong. Overcoming her fear of open water, So Yong learned to swim just 8 weeks before her rst sprint distance event later that summer. Then she registered for the 2009 Hy-Vee Triathlon. Walking to the starting chute at the third annual event last June, she smiled at her trainer and positioned herself at the back of the competitors. \"I just kept telling myself, today's my day. If I can do it, anyone can do it!\" So Yong nished the 1,500-meter swim, 40k bike and 10k run in just over three hours. The average nishing time: 2 hours 53 minutes 54 seconds. HISTORY OF TRIATHLON Roots of the sport can be traced to San Diego in the early 1970s, where a group of friends organized an unconventional competition. Mission Bay Triathlon welcomed 46 eager contenders on a cool September day for a 6-mile run, 5-mile ride and 500-yard swim. Triathlon was born. Today triathlon is regarded as a multi-discipline sport involving continuous competition of swimming, cycling and running (in that order) of varying distances. Triathletes begin the competition on a beach. Depending on water temperature, they may wear wet suits for warmth and buoyancy. Upon completion of the swim, competitors run from water's edge to \"transition,\" where they quickly change from swimming to cycling gear, then exit the transition area for the bike portion of the event. After the cycling course, athletes return to the transition area, throw off helmets and shoes, pull on running shoes and take off for the nal leg of the competition. Every weekend around the world, athletes gather to test their mettle. From races with 100 participants to large events (such as the Hy-Vee Triathlon with nearly 3,000), competitors enter as individuals or in two- or three-person relay teams. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, triathlon debuted as an of cial Olympic sport. Competitors swam 1,500 meters, cycled 40 kilometers (24.9 miles) and ran 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). Professional triathlete and Olympian Sarah Haskins remembers watching the event as a college freshman, thinking she could swim 1,500 meters and run a 10k in about the same time. Her dream was met when she represented the United States in 2008 as part of the U.S. Olympic Triathlon Team. Since that time the sport has seen tremendous growth. USA Triathlon, the national governing body, estimates that nearly one million U.S. athletes participate in triathlon annually. MAKING LIVES EASIER, HEALTHIER, HAPPIER In 2006, the Des Moines Triathlon Club presented the idea of hosting a triathlon to Hy-Vee management. A year and a half later, through much foresight, extensive efforts, planning and organization by Hy-Vee corporate staff, the world class Hy-Vee Triathlon debuted in Des Moines. The results of continued efforts and overcoming challenges is evident. Now in its fourth year, the Hy-Vee Triathlon has quickly become recognized as a world-class race. The 2007 event was one of few International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Cups held in North America; the 2008 Hy-Vee Triathlon was an Olympic-qualifying event; and the 2009 Hy-Vee Triathlon, hosting ITU Team World Championships, grew to an all-time high in participation of amateurs, age group relays, youth, juniors and professionals. An ITU World Cup race is different from typical triathlons in the U.S.\u2014the action is fast and furious all the way to the 30-35 Thrill of the Race.indd 3130-35 PM32 seasons health 2010 nish. The world cup race in West Des Moines features a multi-lap bike course and run course, giving spectators a great opportunity to see triathletes in action. The Hy-Vee Triathlon delivers one of the most thrilling race experiences as well as the largest professional ITU World Cup prize purse of one million dollars. \"It's the Super Bowl of triathlon, the Masters of golf,\" according to professional triathlete and three-time Olympian Hunter Kemper. The vibrant blue-carpeted nish line with fl ags representing countries around the world, the live broadcast fl ashing across the jumbotron, hundreds of fans in the covered stadium and the amazing hospitality\u2014all combine to make this event a favorite among participants. \"Hy-Vee has uplifted the sport of triathlon. They have created a corporate culture of health and well-being and they are visionaries by hosting a world class event with an international audience.\" Kemper adds, \"I encourage everyone to get involved, as a volunteer, an athlete or a spectator. It's lled with something for everyone.\" In 2010, Hy-Vee Triathlon returns to Blue Heron Lake at Raccoon River Park in West Des Moines on June 12 and 13. Saturday events begin with a kids' race. The Sunday morning amateur Olympic Distance age group race will be followed by the Hy-Vee World Cup professional race that afternoon. And radiating through this multi-generational event, the mission statement for Hy-Vee, \"Making Lives Easier, Healthier, Happier\" will ring true, inspiring everyone present. In the 7- to 12-year range last year, Hunter Jackson was one of 600 kids to cross the nish line (up from 130 in 2007). This determined 9-year-old from Urbandale, Iowa, got involved after watching his older cousin compete. \"I had so much fun. I just kept telling myself I think I can. And I did it!\" he says. Hunter's winter training should prepare him to place in the top 10 of this year's event. His advice: \"Practice every day, eat good food, get your sleep and keep believing in yourself.\" J J Bailey, 35, an elite amateur from Des Moines, who appreciates being able to sleep in his own bed before the multisport event, says, \"It is such a thrill to compete against top athletes from around the U.S. and the world in my hometown.\" J J went on to nish fourth overall at Hy-Vee before going on to CARMICHAEL TRAINING SYSTEM As a triathlon trainer for Carmichael Training Systems (CTS) for six years, Nic holas White shares what he's learned over the years. KNOW THE COURSE It's a huge con dence builder to be familiar with the course. You'll avoid taking wrong turns or being surprised by a scary descent or stretch of gravel. When running, swimming and riding the courses are options, do it; otherwise go online and print out course maps, study them and imagine the course as you train. Be aware that last-minute adjustments occur. Having a trainer who is a former competitive athlete is a bene t. From racing and coaching, CTS trainers provide athletes with race details or contact knowledgeable colleagues around the country for advice. PRACTICE TRANSITIONING During the weeks and months before the race, plan your transition area. Arrange bike, shoes, helmet, and gear\u2014then practice transitioning between events. Focus speci cally on bike set up, removing the wet suit, running from transition area with the bike, getting on and off the bike, and getting into running gear. Make the best use of time and space. PACE EVENLY Many athletes work too hard at the beginning of an event then fade and suffer through to the nish. To determine effort levels, CTS trainers measure power and speed and apply training experience for perceived exertion. As you train, strive for steady effort from start to nish. HUNTER KEMPER, professional triathlete and three-time Olympian, says, \"Hy-V ee's vision has uplifted the sport of triathlon by providing a top-notch event with an international audience.

You put together a plan, listen to your body and let 'er rip.\" SARAH HASKINS, Professional Triathlete and Olympian: \"Adv ic e for newbies: Don't do too much too soon.

A bene t of having done numerous large-scale races is that you adapt to the unexpected and manage the unproductive versus the productive emotional levels. This adds up to how I feel on race morning, and I had these going for me with Hy-Vee in my hometown.\" Athletes who are committed to training for multisports are generally motivated to maintain overall physical tness and to eat extremely nutritious diets to nourish their bodies. They also enjoy a camaraderie with other athletes in a social atmosphere in which lifelong friendships are forged. The combination of multisport activities, as compared to training for single sports or events, conditions the entire body, building all-over strength to prevent injury, while allowing some muscles recovery time as others are being pushed. Training, therefore, is also more complicated than for a single event. Planning training sessions, charting progress, working with coaches, trainers and other triathletes, and learning about equipment and courses provides athletes the con dence to succeed. From novice to professional athletes, it's important to assess goals and tness levels, have a realistic well-planned training schedule (including rest periods), and learn how to avoid injury. And it's important that the training be enjoyable. For athletes who are intrigued by triathlon and want to get in shape, on the course and to the nish line, there are numerous books and resources available. Check with local trainers or coaches and other athletes who have been involved.

With help from Hy-Vee, you can make the transition to new favorite foods while restocking your shelves. Not long ago, many organic and natural foods were stocked only in health food stores or in remote locations of large supermarkets. And likely, many of those hard-to-reach choices also had out-of-reach prices. Today, as more consumers understand the fl avor and health bene ts of natural and organic, the demand has increased and there's more variety than ever. The distinctions between organic and natural are easy to understand. \u0081 Certi ed Organic is reserved for foods grown or produced without chemicals, including herbicides and fertilizers in crops and hormones or antibiotics in animals. Organic products also are raised using sustainable farming methods. \u0081 Natural describes foods that are minimally processed with limited re ned ingredients. They're free of arti cial ingredients, colors, preservatives and other unnatural chemicals, and they're responsibly produced and packaged. Many consumers choose organic and natural foods because of the taste, says Beth Pohlman, registered dietitian for Hy-Vee, Altoona, Iowa. \"The biggest comment I hear,\" she says, \"is that people can tell the difference in freshness and in fl avor.\" Health bene ts play a role too. Studies indicate that organic crops more often have higher nutrient content than conventionally grown crops. Some people believe that organic food is safer because it's free of chemicals. And organic milk is shown to have higher levels of vitamins, antioxidants and a healthful fat, which could lead to lower risks for cancer and heart disease. Organic and natural foods can be found in every category, from fresh produce, dairy and meats to canned and frozen foods and dry packaged grains, beans and cereal. If you choose, you can restock your kitchen entirely with new products that can possibly impact your health and the environment. One way to make that change, says Pohlman, is to start entirely fresh\u2014make the change immediate. Clean out your pantry and cabinets, donating everything that's usable to a food pantry. Then shop to replace by buying only natural and organic. Another approach is to make the change gradually while keeping within your budget. \"As items are used and need to be replaced, stock up on the newer versions,\" Pohlman says. \"Start with a basic list of essentials and switch things out as you go.\" Going natural also means cooking and baking more from scratch. With the diversity of grains, fl ours and dry ingredients stocked on shelves, you can cook and bake with all-natural and organic foods. If you're concerned about the quality of whole wheat fl our, for example, Pohlman suggests trying an organic version, grown and processed without added chemicals or ingredients. Pohlman says it's easy to adapt your favorite recipes using natural and organic foods. In most cases, it's a matter of substituting ingredient for ingredient, with no change in amounts or cook time. If you have questions, look for recipes that use all natural ingredients and compare to familiar recipes. When there really is little time to cook a meal, make use of the vast selections of on-the-go natural and organic foods. From snacks and juices to entr\u00e9es, choices are abundant, quality and taste are high, and prices may be only slightly higher. Although much higher priced in the recent past, many natural and organic foods are priced similarly to comparable foods. In the HealthMarket aisles of Hy-Vee, customers nd lower prices than at specialty stores, and one-stop shopping is always a bonus. An unexpected bene t of natural and organic foods, Pohlman says, is that they may extend your list of favorite foods. \"Even if you didn't like certain fruits and vegetables before, organic versions may awaken your taste buds and you'll nd a new favorite.\" 36-41 Change 24. 12 applesauce 2 Hy-Vee large eggs 2 tablespoons water1 (22 oz.) package Full Circle cookie mix 34 cup Hy-Vee dried cranberries 12 cup Hy-Vee English walnut pieces Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.

It includes fresh produce, plus cereals, crackers, soups, cookies and other shelf-stable items.\" According to Pohlman, Full Circle items are minimally processed and free of additives, arti cial colors and arti cial ingredients. The natural fl avors are more likely to emerge. Ingredients in the packaged foods might include evaporated cane juice rather than re ned sugar, butter in place of margarine, and unbleached fl our instead of processed fl our. Individual items offer speci c bene ts too. For example, the organic 100-calorie pouches of Chocolate Chip Wafers have no trans fats and are cholesterol free. Others, such as Chewy Trail Mix Bars and Organic Animal Cookies (original or chocolate) are low in sodium. The many Full Circle snack items are healthful treats for the whole family, Pohlman says. All Natural Soy Crisps, for example, are low in calories and a good source of protein, ber, soy and omega-3 fats. With so many Full Circle items to choose from, plan to make favorite family recipes using mostly Full Circle products, such as Full Circle All-Natural Chili and Marinated Full Circle Salmon Steaks with Mango Relish.

Especially when tired at the end of a hectic day. The thought of going to the store and picking up groceries for dinner, then having to make dinner once we get home, often feels overwhelming. However, eating out every night or taking home fast food sabotages your waistline and isn't good for your health in the long run. Healthful, family-appealing dinners can be a reality. With Hy-Vee on your side, home-cooked meals become much easier. All it takes is some planning and creativity. EAT-AT-HOME APPEAL In addition to costing less, meals at home are likely easier on the calorie budget. Hidden fat, sodium and calories in oversize portions make it hard to keep tabs on what and how much you eat. Preparing food and eating together at home also carves out precious family time, provides opportunities to try new cuisines, instills good eating habits and creates an opportunity to teach your kids to cook. You may even have a little chef in the making, due to your encouragement in the kitchen. The time and effort in planning family menus and meals pay big dividends. If you set aside time each week for planning, nearly half the work is done. A weekend morning or one evening after dinner may be the best time for your weekly planning session. Clip and look for Hy-Vee weekly specials and coupons in newspapers or online at www.hy-vee.com. Check the Hy-Vee online Recipe Center for delicious inspirations. Go through cabinets and the pantry checking for foods to restock. Then make a shopping list (based on what's provided online) and shop for the entire week, eliminating unnecessary midweek trips to the store. WEEKNIGHT FAVORITES \"It's Monday\u2014pasta night!\" Make planning easy and include a variety of dishes that everyone loves in a routine that you can count on. How about these suggestions? Pasta Pronto. The pasta section at Hy-Vee offers a v ariety of pasta and healthful sauces. Brown some ground turkey, add sauce and pasta and serve. In a hurry? Serve refrigerated pasta. Over a weekend, stir up a batch of fresh spaghetti sauce to serve during the week. Make each pasta dinner slightly different to suit the pace of the day or week. Kids' Pick. Get hands-on help from kids. Let them choose recipes, help shop for ingredients and prepare the dishes. Shared kitchen time is ideal for learning about food preparation and for one-on-one chatting. Grill Out. Inexpensive meats, such as chicken breasts, hamburger patties, fl ank steak and sh llets are quick to cook and quick to the table. For a colorful veggie, accompany meats with a packaged cut-up stir-fry mix cooked in a grill wok or wrapped in foil. Slow and Savory Meals. Slow cookers are time-savers, budget- friendly and a healthful w ay to cook. Meats, such as shank, shoulder, round and rump, cook up tender with little to no fat added, and juices stay in the cooker rather than steam away. Soups and stews are full of well-blended fl avors. Find recipes that can be assembled in the morning and left to cook all day, many providing enough for leftovers (another bene t).

The highly oxygenated deep water featuring strong currents forms the ideal natural environment for salmon, eliminating the need for antibiotics, therapeutic agents and chemical support systems common in other farm-raised sh. It is in this environment that Hy-Vee's Black Pearl Scottish Salmon is produced. Add to this the stringent techniques used in Scottish salmon farming and it's clear why Black Pearl Scottish Salmon is a winner for salmon lovers and the environment. NATURAL BEGINNINGS Clean, fast moving, deep waters are critical to this salmon's high quality. Equally important is the nutritious feed on which the salmon is raised. Only 100% pure marine oil (no vegetable substitutes) obtained from sustainable sh stocks in order to mimic the wild salmon's natural diet are used, and the result is a potent omega-3 fatty acid content in the sh. Black Pearl Scottish Salmon is certi ed by The International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14001) ensuring compliance to the highest environmental management system standards and practices. In addition, feed content and farm management practices are certi ed by Label Rouge, the benchmark recognized for quality and nutritional value. To guarantee the sh is as fresh as possible when it arrives in stores, it is live-harvested, processed and delivered to Hy-Vee markets within three days of being caught. Hy-Vee voluntarily employs a full-time U.S. Department of Commerce (USDC) seafood inspector to verify the freshness and quality of these and many more products for your family. HEALTH BENEFITS Jason Pride, Hy-Vee Meat and Deli Supervisor, says this salmon has a wonderful natural fl avor that is clean, pure and buttery sweet. Succulent Scottish Salmon The distinct, memorable taste comes with salmon's added bene ts of being low in saturated fats, trans-fatty acids and calories and high in protein. The American Heart Association has long recommended that people eat sh rich in omega-3 fatty acids at least twice a week. Fish that contain a high amount of fat, including salmon, claim the most health bene ts. This is because the fat in sh is mostly polyunsaturated and monounsaturated rather than saturated, a less healthy fat found in some meat. Salmon stands apart from other sh because it is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which may have the ability to reduce blood clots, lower blood cholesterol levels and reduce risks for heart disease. In addition, omega-3 fat is credited with reducing infl ammation in the body, a condition blamed for causing many health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and some types of cancers. Salmon is a rich source of magnesium and calcium, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6, and it supplies a full day's requirement of vitamin D, which experts believe our population lacks in suf cient quantity. The natural pink color of salmon shows it is a rich source of the naturally occurring astaxanthin carotenoid, which is in the same family of nutrients as vitamin A. ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES Grill, smoke, bake, steam, poach, roast, sear or broil\u2014no matter how you serve it, salmon is delicious. Consider using llets in ginger stir-fried salmon, salmon fettuccine Alfredo, smoked salmon enchiladas, salmon chili, Cajun-blackened salmon or grilled salmon with strawberry salsa. Look for recipes in favorite cookbooks or online. Plan to serve Black Pearl Scottish Salmon often. After purchasing, store it in the coldest part of your refrigerator until you are ready to use it (cook within two days of purchase). Follow cooking instructions in recipe. Salmon will change from an uncooked pink to an opaque pink when cooked. 53 seasons hy-vee.com 42-53 Off 54 seasons health 2010Juice for Life TEXT ALLAN DEAN PHOTOGRAPHY ADAM ALBRIGHTJuicing fresh fruits and vegetables\u2014from a single item to a medley\u2014is an easy way to sip into good health. A little fresh juice goes a long way in bene tting your body with vitamins, minerals and nutrients. Getting a whole day's supply of fresh fruits and vegetables is often overlooked, especially when the foods require time-consuming preparation. Juicing, however, is a fast method to get all the healthful vitamins and nutrients that these foods provide. You can eat well even when you're too busy to sit down to dine on the recommended daily allowances of fruits and veggies. Eating or drinking food in its most natural state means that nutrients stay intact. And because the natural enzymes and nutrients are easily digestible, they go to work fast providing energy, absorbing into cells and protecting against illness and disease. Let color, taste and variety inspire your rst combinations. Begin with favorite fruits, then try combinations of fruits and/or vegetables. For inspiration, visit the produce section at your local Hy-Vee store to take in all the colors, aromas, sizes and shapes of these good-for-you foods. Almost any fruit or vegetable can be juiced or pureed, as long as it's fresh. A good time to juice is when fruits and vegetables are in season, plentiful and at their lowest cost. Prepared juices, quick and ready to drink, are a great nutrition boost, and they can be mixed with fresh juices to create custom blends. Nature Blessed Cherry Concentrate has no additives or preservatives and contains berries that have been picked, quickly processed and bottled. With a bit of sassy taste, this juice works as a pleasant base to add rich orchard-fresh cherry fl avor that blends well with other fruit or vegetable juices. In the HealthMarket and organic sections, nd wheatgrass juice and frozen wheatgrass shots, a super food so nutritious that just 1 ounce is equal to 2\u00bd pounds of green vegetables. Spices, such as cinnamon and nutmeg, are good additions for fl avor and complexity. Juicing uses almost the entire fruit, except bitter peels and seeds. Add-ins, such as yogurt or tofu, bulk up the beverages to make them hearty. For nutrition boosters, visit Hy-Vee for raw nuts and seeds, grains or healthful omega-3 oils, such as sh tomato1 stalk of celery1 carrot Wash the vegetables. Remove the seeds from the pepper and the stem from the tomato. Peel or scrub the carrot. Cut vegetables in chunks.

For citrus juices, look for a juicer that is easy to clean and has slow motor speeds for the maximum amount of juice. The Oster Citric Juicer is a low-cost machine with reversible extraction method to maximize the amount of juice from each piece of fruit. To juice citrus fruits using the Oster Citric Juicer, cut the fruit in half and press fruit rmly on the reamer moving from side-to-side and gently squeezing. The built-in pitcher is easy to pour and great for immediate serving. Power juicers, those capable of juicing bulky fruits and vegetables, such as apples and carrots, are great for advanced juicing. These juicers often can handle a whole or large piece of brous fruit or vegetable with little preparation. Depending on the machine, many handle cores and skin and the leftovers are collected in a separate bin and can be used for baked goods or thrown away.

Find ways to turn family time into memorable moments while strengthening your muscles, brain power and relationships. 58-63 Fit For Fun.indd 59 seasons hy-vee.comIt's game night with your family, and everyone has gathered around the table for a round of Monopoly. You're all buying and selling hotels, passing Go, and getting out of jail free. With conversation, good-natured teasing and a plateful of snacks, you're set to relax and forget the stress of the day. Best of all, you're doing something important\u2014showing that you care for each other, gathering in the same place to share time together. Play\u2014whether it's a board game, sharing a hobby or biking and hiking together\u2014reaps countless health bene ts for everyone in the family. Physical exercise, of course, is important for everyone of all ages. Studies show that elementary school students who experience more than 15 minutes of recess a day demonstrate better behavior than those who don't. And middle school students who are physically active perform better on tests. The mental agility called on in games and puzzles contributes to brain health. For kids, the process of play builds imagination, social and communication skills and memory. For adults, mental exercise is good for keeping the brain sharp, strengthening the parts of the brain that are susceptible to decline over the years. FAMILY FOCUS Time together provides opportunities for the family to relax, let loose of day-to-day cares, share what's going on or worries, solve problems and strengthen relationships. Are you wondering how to incorporate more play into family time or how to carve out time together during busy days of endless activities? Two words: intention and creativity. Be purposeful and imaginative. Set aside playtime with planned activities. Find inspiration in some of these ideas: \u0081 Schedule family game nights. Organize and stock favorite board and card games in a cabinet or where they're easy to see and reach. \u0081 Use time in the car to make up songs or riddles, sing along with music, or play guessing and word games. \u0081 Take the dog for a walk, whatever the weather. It doesn't have to be long, just enough to get outdoors for fresh air and exercise. \u0081 During mealtimes, encourage storytelling, taking turns to tell a story or make up a story, adding to it as it travels around the table. Practice listening attentively. \u0081 Set aside a few minutes after school and homework for a quick game, such as Chinese checkers, or for working on a puzzle set up in a corner for weeks of assembly. \u0081 Regularly schedule family day so it's on the calendar and you stick to it. Let family members take turns determining that day's activities\u2014from physical to mental\u2014for everyone to participate in. FOOD FOR THOUGHT While adding playtime and physical exercise into your life, be mindful of the foods you eat. Snacks are important in boosting energy and metabolism and some foods provide great brain food, according to the American Dietetic Association. Are you wondering what you and your family can munch on that's healthful and good for your brain? Stay clear of sugary snacks, which spike blood sugar then crash. Sample these instead: \u0081 Fresh fruit and berries. Wash, dry and cut up a platter of favorites, including fruits at the height of season and uncommon varieties. Count on apples, oranges, bananas and berries, all of which provide vitamin C, antioxidants and quick and healthy carbs. \u0081 Seeds and nuts. Walnuts, almonds, sunfl ower seeds, pecans\u2014they're all high in ber and protein, plus such nutrients as selenium, vitamin E and omega-3s. Because they're high in calories, eat them in moderation, about 1 ounce per serving. \u0081 Soy crisps. What's a family game without some crunchy snacks? This healthful option to greasy, overly salted chips is made of puffed soy protein. They stay with you longer than traditional chips and pretzels. \u0081 Popcorn. High in ber, popcorn is a whole grain. Have fun popping it in a skillet or kettle on the stovetop or in an air popper. Or choose low-fat microwaveable packages. \u0081 Cocoa and green tea. Warm up after a brisk walk, bike ride or snowball session. Hot chocolate has a higher concentration of antioxidants than green tea. But don't discount the tea; it has been shown to slow the cognitive decline of aging. \u0081 Water. Stay hydrated and healthy with this drink. Keep some cold in the fridge or drink it slightly warmed or with a twist of lemon. Dehydration compromises nerve transmission and diminishes brain function.

In addition to providing hours of family fun, they help protect you from memory loss. Research shows that people who are more active physically and mentally during their middle-age years are three times less likely to develop Alzheimer's. While games and puzzles provide protection, other bene cial activities include reading, doing word jumbles, playing a musical instrument, painting and woodworking. FAMILY PLAY Shared family activities take on many forms, with mental and physical bene ts for everyone. Remind yourself to have fun with these 12 favorites: 1. H.O.R.S.E. AROUND Shooting hoops, playing family games of fl ag football, ice skating, swimming or engaging in other active sports develops social awareness, cooperation and a sense of fairness\u2014plus muscle for a lean body. Less strenuous sports, such as miniature golf, shing and bowling, are ideal for youngsters and seniors. 2. TAKE A WALK Increase blood circulation and oxygenate your brain by getting out for a walk. It can also improve memory and provide health protection for older adults. One study shows that stroke risks were cut by 57% in people who walked as little as 20 minutes a day. 3. SPIN A TALE Storytelling boosts the imagination for children and provides the opportunity to share family history and memories\u2014while letting kids relate to family. Set aside times to tell true tales from your youth, share made-up funny or puzzle stories, and encourage youngsters to spin yarns. Choose a theme, if you like, such as most embarr assing moments, silliest thing you've seen, best birthday or favorite person. 4. PAMPER A PET Whether you wash and walk the dog or feed the cat, spending time with the family pet is a chance to teach kids responsibility\u2014while getting a whole lot of love for a little amount of time and effort. 5. GAZE AT THE STARS Equip yourself with binoculars or a telescope and a chart of the constellations, then spend time with your family looking for Orion and the Big Dipper. 6. SLEEP UNDER THE SKY Camping provides the whole family the opportunity to enjoy a different level of fun: Singing silly songs around a camp re, making and sharing s'mores and staying awake listening to night sounds. You pick the site; camping can be as close as the backyard or as far as a national park. 7. PLANT THE SEED Filling and watching bird feeders and birdbaths close to your house will encourage feathered friends to hang around while creating an educational experience to share. For big vistas, travel to a riverbank or state park to watch for eagles or hawks, and stop in at visitor centers along interstates to learn about birds. 8. WORK IT OUT Rake leaves, shovel snow (taking a break to build a fort and snowman), plant fl owers or weed a garden. Whatever time of year, there's an outdoor activity that's productive, healthful and fun. 9. PICTURE THIS Capture family photos and memories in a scrapbook or photo album\u2014electronic or otherwise. Then embellish the photos with captions or stories, sharing the activity to pass along family history. 10. GET GAME Develop a game-playing habit, stocking a selection of card games, board games and electronics appropriate for all ages. Visit familiar games regularly, and learn new ones to stay sharp. 11. BORROW SOME WHEELS Bicycles, roller skates and skateboards develop leg muscles, balance, coordination and overall tness. Find a fun (and safe) place to ride, donning helmets and other safety gear. 12. BOOK IT Reading books aloud is one of the best ways to introduce kids to the pleasures of imagination and written words. When they're old enough, ask them to read aloud, which prepares them for being comfortable speaking in front of an audience. Games and leisure activities are also great brain boosters for kids. Playtime pursuits stimulate nerve growth in the parts of the brain that process emotions and develop the functions of planning and organization. Kids build important life skills while having fun.

Here's why: When you sweat, you lose fl uid, which can lead to dehydration. That can be serious because it reduces blood volume and the amount of oxygen available to muscles. It also negatively affects heart rate and causes energy levels to drop. Remember that dehydration can occur no matter what the weather or physical activity. Drink before you exercise and again before you feel thirsty. By the time you feel thirsty, you're already dehydrated. During activity, drink 6 to 8 ounces of water every 15 to 20 minutes\u2014children and adults. Encourage kids to drink until they no longer feel thirsty. Then encourage children younger than 10 to drink another half cup of water, and kids over 10 to drink another cup. Don't substitute soda, tea or coffee for water. These drinks act as diuretics, causing even more fl uid loss. 62 seasons health 2010Weight Watcher Cheese: selected varieties 6 to 12 oz. $2.29 Valerie Bertinelli: Losing It and Keeping Fit DVD $10.99 Hy-Vee Dried Fruits or Trail Mix: selected varieties 6 to 9 oz. 3/$5.00 Weight Watcher Yogurt: selected varieties 6 oz. $0.56 Fit N Fresh Filtered Water Bottle: each $7.97 Red Box Free Rental Code: 3HY2VE27 (Valid per redeemable only selected 15.5 to 17.5 lb. $16.99 Droll Yankee Bird Feeder Peppers per 64 seasons health 2010 64 seasons health 2010Pick a Perfect Pepper TEXT JENNIFER RUISCH PHOTOGRAPHY KING AU AND ADAM ALBRIGHTNutrient-rich peppers add vibrant color and sweet to ery fl avor to a variety of dishes.

Ever wonder what gives hot peppers their burning sensations? It's capsaicin [pronounced kap-SAY-ih-sihn], the chemical compound in all peppers (except bells) that stimulates nerve receptors. The hotness level of a pepper is measured on the Scoville Scale. The higher the number of Scoville Heat Units (SHU), the hotter the pepper and the higher the amount of capsaicin. Bell peppers rate zero. Jalape\u00f1os rate 3,500 to 5,000 SHU (about the same as Tabasco sauce), and habaneros rate 100,000 to 350,000 SHU. The current record holder for the world's hottest pepper\u2014the Naga Jolokia pepper (or king cobra chile)\u2014has been sampled as high as 1,041,427 SHU. Grown in northern India, this pepper is currently being tested by the Indian government for use in hand grenades. It may be one pepper to avoid for people who like food with mild heat. CAPSAICIN WONDERS Don't let capsaicin heat ratings frighten you, however, because this natural chemical has remarkable health bene ts. In cancer research studies, capsaicin has been found to obliterate cancer cells\u2014causing almost 80 percent of prostate cancer cells to shrink and die. Further studies conducted in Japan and China show that natural capsaicin directly inhibits the growth of leukemia cells. Recent studies have also shown that capsaicin helps to prevent and relieve headaches and migraines. Based on ndings as a potent anti-infl ammatory agent, capsaicin is currently being studied as a potential treatment for arthritis, psoriasis and diabetic neuropathy, among other things. With myriad health bene ts, versatility and appetizing color, it's almost too much to suggest that peppers can possibly offer more. But here it is: Capsaicin is a thermogenic agent that burns calories. When you read labels, you may see that some \"fat-burning\" supplements contain capsaicin, the ingredient that increases metabolic activity for more than 20 minutes after ingestion. Fresh sliced in salads, sizzled in stir-fries or cut in rings to top a pizza, peppers\u2014in their entire range of beautiful shiny colors\u2014are versatile, delicious and nourishing. This crunchy vegetable is packed with an abundance of nutrients for a vegetable powerhouse unlike any other. Peppers are a family of many varieties, covering a wide range of shapes, fl avors, colors and heat levels. The pepper plant contains two separate parts: the fruit, which is an edible herb, and the seed, which can be used as a spice. All peppers are green while young, and the longer they are left on the vine, they more they ripen\u2014 rst turning red, then yellow. Colors other than green cost more because they've been nurtured longer. Peppers have a long history as a versatile edible. Archaeological evidence indicates that chile peppers were domesticated in Ecuador more than 6,000 years ago. From the Americas peppers made their way around the globe via Spanish and Portuguese explorers, including Christopher Columbus. Peppers are essential to most cuisines\u2014from Louisiana Creole to Szechuan. Paprika (Hungarian for pepper) is made from dried red peppers and is used as a seasoning all over the world. BEAUTIFUL BELLS Few can resist a row of crisp red pepper strips next to a bowl of dip. And peppers in all colors, cut in bite-size pieces, add fl avorful crunch to fresh green and vegetable salads. Deep shiny color is an indication of high levels of nutrients. A single green bell pepper offers twice as much vitamin C as an orange; and one red, yellow or orange bell pepper offers three to four times as much vitamin C as an orange. Diets rich in vitamin C ght infl ammation in the body, work toward a strong immune system and contribute to healthy joints and skin. The brighter the color and the shinier the skin, the greater the concentration of antioxidants, which ght free radicals (an uncharged molecule that can contribute to diseases).

This old adage is making a comeback, from the way corporations do business to how we live at home. Here are ways we're learning to be frugal and reduce stress on our planet. People everywhere have learned a lot the past few years about how to treat the earth with more respect, consume responsibly and lighten the environmental impact while doing business and living day to day. Caring for the environment requires conscious thought and, admittedly, a little sacri ce. But that sacri ce is worth every effort as we consider how to make the planet healthy for generations to follow. At Hy-Vee, taking care of the environment while being frugal makes common sense. Actions begin at the top, demonstrating what can be accomplished at that level and inspiring employees and consumers to keep the environmental ball rolling\u2014because we're all in this together. GETTING THE MOST FROM ROAD MILES AND PACKAGING Fuel-ef ciency, a priority for everyone, is critical to getting food to stores where and when it's needed. To keep transportation costs low and operate ef ciently, Hy-Vee has installed aerodynamic wide-base tires with rolling resistance and trailer skirting to reduce airfl ow on their trucks. Onboard computers collect data to evaluate drivers, trucks and equipment, helping to identify where improvements are needed. And routing software ensures that drivers make the most of road and delivery time and that there are fewer trucks on the road. Trailers are seldom unloaded to return to the warehouse empty; instead they are restocked for deliveries en route to the warehouse or lled with recyclables. The warehouse in Chariton, Iowa doubles as a center for collecting, baling and recycling huge amounts of cardboard boxes and plastic bags, keeping them out of land lls and putting them back to use. Baling equipment compacts material in 1,000-pound bales, which are then sold and recycled into new products. Recycled containers are easily identi ed by the bold green arrows icon, looping in a triangle shape to signify continuous use and reuse. In addition to behind-the-scenes actions to keep the carbon footprint as low as possible, Hy-Vee has been at the forefront of encouraging consumers to reuse shopping bags. Trendy colorful bags made from recycled materials are inexpensive, sturdy and convenient for toting back and forth to ll with groceries or to use for a variety of activities. The pretty, ample-size health-themed reusable bag shown at right is ideal for carrying more than groceries, showing that being frugal and caring for the environment can also be classy. Many shoppers have already made it a habit to keep bags handy to grab at the back door or stash in the car immediately after unloading. If you haven't already done so, remind yourself for several shopping trips and it will soon become a worthy habit. When plastic bag use is unavoidable, resolve to repurpose. At home, use bags to line trash cans, hold soiled or wet clothing in gym bags, pick up yard and pet waste, or enclose paintbrushes and rollers between applications. When more bags accumulate than you can use, drop them in the large bins at the entry of your Hy-Vee store for recycling. Along with other plastics, the bags may nd their way into something as sturdy and long-lived as colorful park and playground equipment. BUILD WITH BAGS FOR PLAYGROUNDS OF FUN Reducing the millions of plastic bags produced and wasted is being addressed on national and local levels. To encourage shoppers to recycle and cut down on plastic bag waste, Hy-Vee is part of the Build With Bags (BWB) Program, a cooperative effort of the Iowa Grocery Industry Association, Keep Iowa Beautiful, Iowa Department of Natural Resources and Metro Waste Authority. BWB is committed to reduce the consumption of plastic bags, increase the use of reusable bags, double the number of plastic bags recycled over the next two years, and develop and administer a grant program to help parks and schools purchase playground equipment, benches and tables from recycled materials. The well-engineered equipment is built to last for generations and to be extremely safe for playing while enticing kids to be active. Rather than support legislation that calls for banning bags, BWB teaches about and promotes recycling, providing communities an opportunity to share in the bene ts of the program by increasing the demand for recycled products. 70-71 Recycle Blooming Kit $8.00 Health Themed Reusable Bag: each 4/$6.00 seasons hy-vee.com 71GREEN IS BEAUTIFUL INDOORS AND OUT At every level, people have the opportunity to make a positive change for our environment. If you're looking for ways beyond typical recycling to be frugal and kind to the planet, get involved in your community. Check with local park and recreation representatives to help plant trees and gardens. Volunteer on cleanup days to remove litter in parks and along trails and streams. While getting a good workout outdoors, you'll become better acquainted with your local park system and make the environment a cleaner place. In your own yard, plant vegetable and fl ower gardens, grasses and trees, especially to provide shade for your home and air-conditioning units. During cool months, plan where and what to plant and start fl ower and vegetable seeds indoors to transplant later. Find ideas online and in books for planting gardens that attract birds and butterfl ies and for ways to get your yard in tune with Mother Nature. Encourage kids to help; getting them involved teaches valuable lessons about stewardship along with the joys of being outdoors. Indoors, there are many ways to reduce and reuse. In the laundry room, be conservative. Wash only full loads of clothes using the coolest water possible and eco-friendly detergents. Hang some clothes to dry, if that's an option, or tumble-dry a little then hang clothes on hangers to completely dry. While saving on gas or electricity, the humidity that evaporates makes the air easier to breathe in your home. In the kitchen, save fruit and vegetable peelings and eggshells to compost, enriching garden soil without using chemical fertilizers. Composting can be done small to large scale, using special under-the-sink containers or outdoors permanent bins. Outdoor bins also collect yard waste, eliminating the need and cost of yard waste bags and the expense of soil amendments. Check kitchen shops for indoor composters and county extension of ces for plans to build an outdoor compost bin. Living green makes environmental and economical sense. To celebrate being a good environmental steward, brighten up your home\u2014or that of a friend or neighbor\u2014with pretty blooming bulbs set in beautiful recycled glass vases. The blooms will remind you to continue to live green while adding a welcome splash of color that summons spring. When the bulbs nish blooming, return them to the earth, either planted in the garden or added to compost to enrich your garden later. Together, we'll make our earth a healthful place to live. health 2010We're here to help you. The next time you need to ll or re ll a prescription, look to your local Hy-Vee Pharmacy.
