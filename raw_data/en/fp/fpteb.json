Maine EMS and MDPB COVID-19 Vaccination Reference and Talking Points PURPOSE: It is expected that EMS clinicians, other frontline healthcare professionals from hospitals and long-term care facilities, and residents of long-term care facilities will be among the first groups of individuals to be offered the COVID-19 vaccine. The timing of this and the initial number of doses Maine will receive remains uncertain. In anticipation of vaccine release, Maine EMS and the Medical Direction and Practices Board (MDPB) are preparing this reference guide with included talking points to share the most contemporary vaccine evidence available. Ultimately it is your decision whether you are vaccinated against COVID-19. Maine EMS and the MDPB hope this empowers you to make a meaningful decision regarding vaccination. Please note that this Reference Guide is not intended to supplant the Maine EMS document \"Maine Vaccination Campaign Plan for Public Safety Professionals.\" That document is intended to discuss the logistics and operations of vaccine implementation and can be found on the Maine EMS Website, under \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) EMS Resource Page\". Instead, this document is intended to describe the science and evidence surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine so that you may make an educated decision regarding vaccination. This document is divided into specific topics, including: 1. General information; 2. Vaccine development process; 3. COVID-19 vaccine technology; 4. Vaccine safety; and 5. Vaccine efficacy. GENERAL INFORMATION U.S. CDC: Common COVID-19 Vaccination Facts COVID-19 vaccines will NOT give you COVID-191 o None of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in development in the United States use the live virus that causes COVID-19. o The goal for each of the vaccines is to \"teach\" our immune system how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms, such as fever, body aches, headaches, and fatigue as well as local reactions at the injection site. o These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity. 1 From the website: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits/facts.html.

COVID-19 vaccines will NOT cause you to test positive on COVID-19 viral PCR tests.2,3,4 o The goal of vaccination is for your body to develop an immune response. o This immune response will not cause you to test positive when tested using PCR tests. o Once your body develops an immune response, there is a possibility you may test positive on some antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate you had a previous exposure to the virus, or parts of the virus (i.e. the spike protein), and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Experts are currently looking at how COVID-19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results. People who have gotten sick with COVID-19 may still benefit from getting vaccinated.5 o At this time, the duration of the immune response after infection is uncertain. The immunity someone gains from having an infection, called natural immunity, varies from person to person. Some early evidence suggests natural immunity may not last very long. o While data is limited, it appears that previously infected individuals are at risk of reinfection and therefore could benefit from vaccination.6,7 Getting vaccinated can help prevent you from getting sick with COVID-198 o While many people with COVID-19 have only a mild illness, others may get a severe illness or they may even die. o There is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you, even if you are not at increased risk of severe complications. o If you get sick, even with an asymptomatic illness, you also may spread the disease to friends, family, and others around you while you are sick. o COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without having to experience sickness. 2 See 1 3 More info about Viral Tests: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html 4 More info about Antibody Tests: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html 5 See 1 6 Polack et al., \"Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine\" NEJM, December 10, 2020 https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577 7 \"Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee Meeting December 10, 2020 FDA Briefing Document Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Sponsor\" from the website: https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download, accessed 12-9-2020 8 See 1 Figure 1 How Humans Develop Immunity (Source: https-//media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41586-020-01221-y/d41586-020-01221-y, accessed 12.8.2020) Maine EMS/MDPB COVID-19 Vaccine Reference Guide and Talking Points Page 3 of 11 Version: Dec. 16, 2020 Disclaimer: Material within this document is subject to change pending new information, please see the Maine EMS webpage for the most up-to-date information. Logistical/Handling Issues The first two available vaccines will be the Pfizer and Moderna Vaccines. The following describes some of the logistical information known at this time for each of the vaccines. Pfizer o Two (2) doses, 21 days apart.* \u00a7 While there are reports of benefit after receiving the first dose of Pfizer's vaccine, the study methodology was not intended to test the efficacy of only one vaccine dose. Given this, all vaccine recipients are expected to receive two (2) doses of the vaccine.9,10 o Storage:11 \u00a7 Ultra-cold freezer (-94\u00b0 F) for up to six (6) months \u00a7 Refrigerator (35.6-46.4\u00b0 F) for up to five (5) days or 120 hours \u00a7 Pfizer Shipper container for up to 15 days with dry ice refreshing These are a 16\"x16\"x22\" distribution system lined with dry ice; may hold up to 5,000 doses \u00a7 Needs to be reconstituted with 1.8 ml of normal saline, and then must be used within six (6) hours \u00a7 Once reconstituted, each vial holds five doses of vaccine Moderna o Two (2) doses, 28 days apart.* o Storage: \u00a7 Standard freezer (-4\u00b0 F) for up to six (6) months \u00a7 Refrigerator (35.6-46.4\u00b0 F) for up to 30 days \u00a7 Can be kept at room temperature for up to 12 hours o No reconstitution required. * All trials were based on the \"prime and boost\" model of vaccination in which an initial dose is provided, followed by a second dose several weeks later. No efficacy information is available regarding the protection after a single dose of the vaccine and no current plans exist for these two vaccines that rely on a single dose of the vaccine.12,13 9 See 6 10 See 7 11 \"Pfizer BioNTech Vaccine: Storage, Handling and Administration\" presentation on October 20, 2020 12 See 6 13 See 7 Maine EMS/MDPB COVID-19 Vaccine Reference Guide and Talking Points Page 4 of 11 Version: Dec. 16, 2020 Disclaimer: Material within this document is subject to change pending new information, please see the Maine EMS webpage for the most up-to-date information. VACCINE DVELOPMENT PROCESS Figure 2 Operation Warp Speed (Source: https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/13/2002476369/-1/-1/0/200813-D-ZZ999-100.JPG, accessed on December 8, 2020) Background: Accelerated Vaccine Development Process14 An innovative feature of the COVID-19 vaccine development program is that several processes have overlapped rather than occurred in a slower, step-by-step series. This was due, in part, to significant funding investment that enabled processes such as mandatory manufacturing plant inspections, development of distribution processes and/or vaccine production to occur prior to the formal Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) review process. This results in immediate availability of the vaccine for use following EUA approval. It is important to recognize that this parallel processing HAS NOT affected or altered the scientific process of testing the vaccine. The FDA required all vaccine manufacturers to perform pre-clinical trials testing safety and efficacy in non-human primates, followed by Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials. Each phase of the clinical trial process is intended to answer questions surrounding safety and efficacy. o Phase 1 trials introduce the vaccine to a small group of healthy volunteers (up to 100) to test the safety of the therapy in healthy subjects. 14 Morita J, Belongia \"America's Last Line of Defense for a Safe Vaccine\" Scientific American From the Website https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/americas-last-line-of-defense-for-a-safe-vaccine/, accessed on December 8, 2020 Maine EMS/MDPB COVID-19 Vaccine Reference Guide and Talking Points Page 5 of 11 Version: Dec. 16, 2020 Disclaimer: Material within this document is subject to change pending new information, please see the Maine EMS webpage for the most up-to-date information. o Phase 2 trials administer the vaccine to a larger group of volunteers (usually hundreds) to determine the proper dose of the vaccine by evaluating the immune response to therapy. o Phase 3 trials introduce the vaccine to an even larger group of volunteers (usually in the 1000s to 10,000s) and compare this group's response to the vaccine in comparison to that of a similar group who received a placebo. The major goals of Phase 3 trials are to test the efficacy of the vaccine. \u00a7 For more information regarding basic information regarding clinical trials, please refer to this link: https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/basics. All vaccine manufacturers followed this common process. The one element of the process that was amended is that Phase 3 trials may last up to 3 years. In other vaccine or drug trials, this duration of the Phase 3 trial is intended to determine the duration of effect, or the duration of protection. It is essential to recognize that the duration of Phase 3 trials IS NOT intended to learn about safety or adverse effects of the vaccine, but rather duration of protection. Experience with other vaccines reveals that most, if not all, adverse events related to vaccination occur within six (6) weeks after receiving a vaccine. To account for this time period, the FDA required that vaccine manufacturers extended their Phase 3 trials to eight (8) weeks to ensure possible adverse reactions would be identified. This change, reduced time period for Phase 3, is limit our understanding of HOW LONG protection from the vaccine will last. We will not know when we receive the vaccine if we will require a second series of vaccine in the future. This information will be determined but will be tested in parallel process to the implementation of the vaccination. COVID-19 VACCINE TECHNOLOGY mRNA vaccines were initially developed in the 1990s. The mRNA used in these vaccines is wrapped in a lipid nanoparticle that maintains the mRNA stability. The wrapped mRNA enters a cell and is then picked up by cellular ribosomes. Ribosomes are outside of the cell's nucleus and therefore distant from the cell's DNA. This technology provides our ribosomes with mRNA instructions for making the SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) spike protein. When our cells receive these instructions, they briefly produce the spike protein. Our immune system recognizes the spike protein as \"foreign\" and makes antibodies to destroy it. If we get infected with the real virus, our immune system recognizes the threat and is already prepared to fight it. mRNA is very short-lived, does not enter the cell nucleus and has no direct interaction with a patient's DNA. In fact, cold storage is required to keep the mRNA stable enough to be effective before it rapidly degrades. This vaccine technology WILL NOT alter your DNA or genetic code. There are several mRNA vaccines currently being studied, including a Zika vaccine, a CMV vaccine and some of the influenza and rabies vaccines. Experience from these vaccines proves both the safety and efficacy of this technology.

Receiving an mRNA vaccine will not alter your DNA15 mRNA stands for messenger ribonucleic acid and can most easily be described as instructions for how to make a protein or even just a piece of a protein. mRNA is not able to alter or modify a person's genetic makeup (DNA). The mRNA from a COVID-19 vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell where our DNA is kept. o mRNA from the vaccine does not interact with or affect our DNA in any way. mRNA particles are broken down by the body within a few days which adds to the vaccine's safety.16 COVID-19 vaccines that use mRNA work with the body's natural defenses to safely develop protection (immunity) to disease. Therapeutic mRNA technologies were first considered in 1989 with mRNA vaccine platforms considered a short time later.17 The first successful animal studies of mRNA vaccines were performed in 1993 with development of an influenza vaccine.18 The first successful Phase 1 clinical trial of mRNA vaccine in humans was an mRNA vaccine against rabies in 2017.19 Subsequent Phase 1 trials have evaluated and proven safety and efficacy in humans receiving mRNA influenza and Zika vaccines.20 For more information about mRNA vaccines, go to https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html The first released vaccines are expected to be mRNA vaccines, but additional vaccine technologies will likely be released in the future.

VACCINE SAFETY Post-vaccination symptoms usually occur very early after vaccination, most commonly within the first 24 hours but as late as six (6) weeks later. All the Phase 3 clinical trials lasted for at least eight (8) weeks to better understand the potential adverse effects related to receiving the vaccine. Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Well tolerated across all populations (43,000 participants enrolled); no serious safety concerns observed. Primary post-vaccination symptoms: fatigue (4.6%), chills (2.1% in the 16-55-year-old age group) and headache (3.2%).21,22 ,23,24,25 The FDA grades the severity of vaccine reactions. Grade 3 (serious) adverse events are the most serious and they correspond to the recipient not being able to perform their normal daily activities. The only two Grade 3 adverse reactions observed with a frequency over 2% were fatigue (3.8%) and headache (2.0%). Older adults had fewer adverse events.26,27,28,29,30 o The onset of systemic reactions occurred within one to two (1-2) days from vaccination with a median duration of one (1) day.31 The Pfizer vaccine was first released in the UK and during early implementation, two individuals with history of anaphylaxis had allergic reactions and were treated and recovered on site. Subsequently the FDA has asked all individuals to advise their vaccine provider if they have any allergies prior to receiving the vaccine. In addition, the FDA has added that the anyone in the following to groups should NOT receive the vaccine: o Anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction after receiving a previous dose of this vaccine; and/or o Anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine (mRNA, lipids ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and sucrose).32 21 Dr. Dora Mills, \"COVID-19 Vaccines - MaineHealth Clinical Update 12/1/2020\" presented December 2, 2020 22 https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine 23 Walsh E, et. al, \"Safety and Immunogenicity of Two RNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates\" NEJM, October 14, 2020 24 Polack et al., \"Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine\" NEJM, December 10, 2020 https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577 25 \"Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee Meeting December 10, 2020 FDA Briefing Document Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Sponsor\" from the website: https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download, accessed 12-9-2020 26 See 21 27 See 22 28 See 23 29 See 24 30 See 25 31 See 25 32 \"Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers: Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to Prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Individuals 16 years of Age and Older\" from the website: https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download Maine EMS/MDPB COVID-19 Vaccine Reference Guide and Talking Points Page 9 of 11 Version: Dec. 16, 2020 Disclaimer: Material within this document is subject to change pending new information, please see the Maine EMS webpage for the most up-to-date information. Grade 4 reactions are reactions that require emergent care or hospitalization. No one who received this vaccine suffered a Grade 4 reaction during Phase 1 trials.33,34,35 o During Phase 3 trials, two patients in the vaccine group and two patients in the placebo groups both suffered grade 4 fevers.36 Moderna Vaccine Well tolerated (30,351 participants enrolled); no serious safety concerns observed. Primary post-vaccination symptoms: injection site pain, fever, fatigue, chills, myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), headache.37,38,39 o All adverse reactions are more common in the 65 and younger age group.40 Grade 3 (serious) events occurring at a frequency greater than or equal to 2% after the first dose included injection site pain (2.7%). After the second dose, these included fatigue (9.7%), arthralgia (5.2%), at the injection site.41 Local reactions were primarily one to two days after vaccination and generally persisted for one to three days. Systemic reactions primarily occurred within one to two days of receiving the vaccine and persisted for one to two days.42 No one who received this vaccine suffered a Grade 4 reaction during Phase 1 trials.43 o During phase 3 trials, there was a 0.1% incidence of grade 4 fevers in BOTH the placebo and vaccine group as well as one vaccine patient who suffered grade 4 fatigue, one vaccine patient who suffered grade 4 arthralgias (joint pains) and one vaccine patient who suffered grade 4 nausea and vomiting.44 Due to the possibility of viral syndrome-type post-vaccination symptoms, consider staggering vaccination implementation for public safety personnel in order to ensure adequate duty ranks. VACCINE EFFICACY This section focuses on the first two released vaccines, the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. As new vaccines are released, this section will be updated.

Significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction; Admission to intensive care unit; or Death Maine EMS and the MDPB hope that this reference document has been informative and supportive in your decision-making process. The advent of a vaccination campaign allows us to collectively transition from a defensive posture against this pandemic to an offensive posture and thus move back toward our normal lives. This does not mean we will immediately reduce our protective postures including screening for PUIs; universal masking of patients and EMS clinicians; airborne precautions when caring for PUIs/known positives, performing aerosol-generating procedures, and encountering those unable to comply with masks; hand washing; distancing; etc. Herd immunity, or resistance to the spread of an infectious disease due to pre-existing immunity of a high proportion of individuals, is achieved only after an estimated 75% of the population is vaccinated. Once this goal is achieved, we will be able to return to some form of our normal activities. Thank you for reviewing this information. We are immensely grateful for all you have done for our communities and state, your efforts and participation in this vaccination campaign will assist us in collectively achieving the goal of herd immunity.
