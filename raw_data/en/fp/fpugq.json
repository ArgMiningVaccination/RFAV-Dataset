Juvenile drug treatment courts (JDTC) are designed for youth with substance use disorders who come into contact with the juvenile justice system. The new guidelines provide juvenile courts with an evidence-based, treatment-oriented approach that emphasizes family engagement, and addresses the substance use and often co-occurring mental health disorders experienced by the youth. OJJDP partnered with a research team, experts in the field, and other federal agencies to develop the guidelines to support judges and professional court staff, young people with substance use disorders, and their families. The guidelines are organized into key objectives with corresponding guideline statements, and include rigorous supporting research and considerations for implementation. Additional research reports, the research translation process, the list of partners, and frequently asked questions can be accessed in the [Supporting Information](/programs/JDTC-supporting-information).

Within this framework, various stakeholders collaborate to find innovative and effective strategies to address problems pertaining to specific JDTC cases. Evidence Organizations that serve youth across several systems that identify common goals, agree to share resources, and coordinate effectively through a strong stakeholder team experience greater success with their interventions. Practice Considerations There are a number of components that are important for building a comprehensive approach to service coordination.

Reno, NV: National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. Overview JDTCs should be aware of the risks associated with adolescent substance use disorder and that youth will return to the same environments they lived in before they were part of the JDTC. There is much to be gained if the JDTC is successful at working together with the schools where JDTC participants are enrolled. Evidence Teachers and school administrators can be important assets when they support and care for the youth; however, schools can also be barriers if they do not cooperate with and invest in the youth or if they are quick to expel youth. Practice Considerations JDTCs should make educational goals a priority for each youth, which may include tracking individual progress on school attendance, keeping up with homework assignments, staying out of trouble in school, and maintaining academic performance. JDTC programs should explore alternative educational opportunities for youth through outreach in local school systems, with the goal of developing prosocial opportunities for program participants.

Overview When adopting an intervention, staff at all levels should be trained to understand the program's purpose, what the research says about its likely impact, and how it aligns with the agency's mission. In the context of JDTCs, this would apply to the court and each collaborating agency. Evidence Regular training helps staff develop skills and manage cases effectively, which can also keep the program focused on its mission and minimize staff turnover. Practice Considerations Training and technical assistance for JDTCs should focus on the nature of substance use disorders and the dynamics of recovery; staff skill development and effective case management; screening and assessment for substance use and criminogenic needs, particularly relating to the development of treatment plans; adolescent development and the developmental perspective for juvenile justice programming; cultural competence in working with youth and families; family engagement and working with caregivers through a trauma-informed lens; the use of effective contingency management strategies (e.g., incentives and sanctions); the purpose of each intervention implemented for JDTC participants, the evidence of its value, and how it aligns with the JDTC's mission; and the effective use of evidence-based practices (that address co-occurring mental health issues and other co-occurring issues such as family dysfunction) in substance use treatment.

Courts must also identify barriers that keep the family from participating, including the timing of hearings, physical settings where meetings and hearings take place, and the family's level of comprehension, and engage the family in resolving these barriers. Evidence A lack of family and parental support and involvement creates challenges across the JDTC system. Practice Considerations It is important for parents (or nonparental legal guardians) to engage in the process. In some cases, another family member, a caring adult, a mentor, or a recovery coach may stand in for the parent or guardian.

Overview Professional court interpreters are those with native-level proficiency in both English and another language, including sight translation, consecutive interpreting, and simultaneous interpreting, and who the court has designated to perform interpretive services. Evidence It is important to employ the family's native language when parents or guardians with limited English proficiency are involved. Practice Considerations JDTCs can offer professional interpreters to parents or guardians with limited English proficiency and/or hearing deficiency to help ensure all parties involved can equally and effectively communicate with each other. All documents should also be translated into the native languages of all non-English-speaking JDTC participants. Various levels of certification exist for court interpreters; this is necessary because the legal language that needs to be conveyed is often complex.

Research evidence has pointed to these three characteristics\u2014youth has a substance use disorder, youth is at least 14 years old, and youth has moderate to high risk of reoffending\u2014that are related to more positive outcomes. Evidence Youth who have a substance use disorder have higher rates for successfully completing JDTCs than those who use drugs or alcohol but do not have a substance use disorder. Practice Considerations Youth who do not meet all of the criteria (e.g., they do not have a substance use disorder, are younger than 14 years old, and are at low risk of reoffending) should be diverted from formal JDTC processing into community-based alternatives. Youth who exceed these criteria and who exhibit additional common co-occurring characteristics, such as mental health diagnoses and other types of offenses, can still participate in the program according to the stated eligibility policy, which does not exclude the possibility of additional needs.

Overview It is an important practice for JDTCs to use needs assessment tools for substance use and/or mental health to determine potential clients' level of substance use disorder and mental health status as well as their family's level of substance use disorder. Evidence High-quality assessments yield information that can help determine eligibility and suitability for JDTC participation and also for appropriate treatment planning decisions, thus increasing the likelihood that participants will successfully complete the JDTC program. Practice Considerations JDTCs should use standardized screening and assessment tools; i.e., the tools should include measures that must be delivered in a specific way every time, are supported by a body of research that demonstrates the tools' reliability and validity, and have been tested for use with the specific population that the JDTC serves.

Overview JDTCs should not engage youth who do not meet the minimum eligibility criteria as youth who have a substance use disorder and are at moderate or high risk for reoffending. In fact, such youth who are processed through JDTC programs might actually be harmed. Evidence Formal processing in the juvenile justice system does not necessarily reduce subsequent delinquent activity. Based on official data, it appears that placing low-risk youth in juvenile justice programs can increase the prevalence, incidence, and severity of such activity. Practice Considerations Early interventions are defined as those employed for youth who use substances but do not have a substance use disorder. Early intervention programs are brief in nature and have been found to be effective for youth who did not have substance use disorders. In addition, these programs can be operated effectively in community-based settings (often in schools) and cost less than substance use treatment programs.

Overview It is important to ensure that youth who are at risk of entering and those who are currently involved in the juvenile justice system receive fair and beneficial treatment. Racial and ethnic disparities, gender-responsive needs, and the disparate experiences of LGBTQI-GNC youth must be considered. Evidence Youth of color in the juvenile justice system often experience treatment that differs from the treatment afforded white youth, even when controlling for objective criteria such as current offense and offense history. Both male and female youth from minority racial and ethnic backgrounds are underrepresented among graduates of juvenile drug courts. Practice Considerations Cultural competency includes creating policies and procedures that respect and respond to cultural differences between JDTC team members and the youth they serve.

Evidence Research shows that youth's behavior and demeanor are directly linked to their parents' willingness to participate. When the family spends time supporting the youth, it is more likely the youth will successfully complete the program. Practice Considerations Involving parents or guardians in status hearings, perhaps by offering incentives, can facilitate their collaboration in behavioral management because they maintain their parental control. One suggestion is to appoint a liaison to help the family navigate the process, understand its rights, and answer questions. Parents and guardians should receive information in a format that is easily accessible, both verbally and in writing, and that takes language barriers into account. Parents and guardians also desire better home-based support to reinforce treatment plans. The JDTC team and providers should offer support, information, and resources to families that are relevant to the youth's needs and that will help the family ensure the youth's success.

Available online: Overview One of the key elements that separates the JDTC from other courts is the personal relationship the judge builds with the youth, which is based on intense supervision and frequent contact. Evidence Mericle and colleagues found that JDTC success could be enhanced if the judge provides structure and takes responsibility for participants if this is lacking at home. It is also important for judges to intervene in ways that increase youth's self-esteem. Practice Considerations The judge must be nonjudgmental\u2014the key element is not to come to a judgment, but to hold the youth accountable through the structure of establishing goals and the effective use of graduated incentives and sanctions.

Overview For each participant, judges must consistently apply behavioral contingencies across the full JDTC program. Evidence Consistency in the application of incentives and sanctions is one of the key factors enhancing the success of the JDTC intervention.

Available online: Overview The entire JDTC team should meet regularly in advance of judicial hearings. Weekly staff meetings should be used both to evaluate youth's compliance and to give staff a better understanding of how to work with each youth over time. Evidence The therapeutic orientation of JDTC staff is not limited to connecting youth to drug treatment programs; it also includes the multitude of remedies the staff use to correct youth behavior. Practice Considerations The policy manual should describe the purpose and format of the meetings, how often the team will meet, and the decisionmaking process (e.g., consensus is often the chosen process) that the team will use to prepare for the court hearings. This information should present concrete evidence on how each participant is progressing through his or her treatment plan. Presenters may provide this information before the staffing meeting. If that cannot be done, then during the meeting presenters should share all relevant information, deliver it objectively, and interpret it well so other team members can understand it. Presenters should also integrate their information with other data being presented and should place it into the larger context of the youth's overall profile. Consistent with the principles of family engagement, parents and guardians should have the opportunity to provide input or to participate in the process prior to the court hearing.

The process should help determine if a youth is eligible for a JDTC program and should also provide a complete picture of a youth's substance use issues. The process should incorporate structured assessment interviews that lend themselves to creating this complete picture. Evidence Youth who have a substance use disorder have higher rates for successfully completing JDTCs than those who use drugs or alcohol but do not have a substance use disorder. Practice Considerations To better understand the various challenges a youth may face when he or she enters a JDTC program, JDTCs should screen and assess youth for a range of risks and needs. These assessments need to be completed by the time the youth first appears in the JDTC (ideally, at intake), but may also be completed prior to referral to the JDTC. Trained and certified professionals should complete all assessments. The needs assessment process must be done using validated tools, assess a greater array of needs, and inform the development of case management and treatment plans.

Overview Criminogenic needs include a history of antisocial behavior; an antisocial personality pattern; antisocial cognition; antisocial peers; and needs related to family, school, use of leisure time, and substance use. Evidence Reductions in recidivism are greater when programming addresses the criminogenic needs of system-involved youth. Practice Considerations There are many risk assessment systems that include comprehensive sets of items that assess criminogenic needs. To select an appropriate assessment tool for a local JDTC, it is recommended that the decision makers take into account the purpose for which the assessment tool will be used (i.e., identifying treatment targets) and the relevance of the instrument to the objectives of the JDTC. Finally, it is critical that the selected assessment tool is evidence based.

Overview There is a high prevalence of co-occurring mental and substance use disorders among youth in JDTC programs. Evidence Research shows that 60 percent to 90 percent of youth who come in contact with the juvenile justice system have at least one diagnosable mental health disorder. Practice Considerations According to the 2002 Consensus Conference on Mental Health Assessments in Juvenile Justice Settings, \"a comprehensive mental health assessment must be based on careful review of information from multiple sources and must measure a range of mental health concerns.\" Mental health assessments should include direct observation and interviews with youth, mental status examination, chart reviews, and interviews with parents and other caregivers, along with a family history, when possible.

Available online: Overview In addition to the prevalence of mental health disorders among youth in JDTC programs, the presence of significant symptoms of PTSD and other trauma-related conditions strongly suggests that JDTCs need to screen for and assess the contributions of traumatic childhood and current experiences on the mental health and substance use of each youth. Evidence Clinicians working with youth in the juvenile justice system, including JDTCs, should \"carefully consider trauma in developmental formulation, differential diagnosis, and functional assessment.\" Failure to do so may lead to errors in identifying mental health needs as they relate to trauma exposure and thus jeopardize the proper alignment of treatment with need. Practice Considerations To conduct screening for psychological trauma, the National Child Traumatic Stress Network recommends inquiring about a youth's history of exposure to traumatizing events through a range of tools that vary widely in length and comprehensiveness.

A Primer for Mental Health Practitioners Working With Youth Involved in the Juvenile Justice System. Washington, DC: Technical Assistance Partnership for Child and Family Mental Health. Overview Practitioners, policymakers, and researchers focused on youth development and prevention all agree that a successful transition from childhood to adulthood requires more than preventing negative behaviors, but must focus on promoting positive youth development through assessing a range of positive and problem behaviors. Evidence The Center for the Study of Social Policy defines well-being as \"the healthy functioning of children and youth that allows them to be successful throughout childhood and into adulthood.\" Four domains of child well-being have been identified, including cognitive functioning, physical health and development, emotional/behavioral functioning, and social functioning. Practice Considerations The assessment of well-being needs and strengths is a focus on the positive and often encompasses the evaluation of strengths of the family as well as the youth. In practice, conducting these assessments is a strategy for engaging with the family. A strengths-based focus on positive youth development is based on what is known from research on adolescent development but is still a cultural shift when adopted in juvenile justice agencies.

Overview It is important to conduct needs assessments of parents and family members of youth in JDTC programs because they are often facing their own stresses, trauma, and mental and behavioral health issues, including substance use disorders, which can be a risk factor for these youth. Evidence For JDTC programs to succeed, they must screen for and address family needs. For example, screening and assessment should examine how parental substance use affects bonds with children and how parental role modeling influences youth behavior. Needs assessments should also seek to identify more positive coping skills for both youth and parents. Practice Considerations Active participation on the part of parents, family members, and other caregivers in the JDTC process is critical for youth to successfully complete a JDTC program. Active family involvement helps support the youth's treatment; it may also strengthen the family and enhance the ability of parents, family members, and caregivers to provide the support, structure, and guidance a youth needs after he or she completes the program.

Available online: Overview For JDTCs, the information gained from a comprehensive assessment can be used to (1) initiate a plan for specific treatment, (2) identify other psychosocial needs, (3) describe the individual's specific strengths, or (4) evaluate the individual's motivation for treatment. Evidence Programs that use a more flexible fidelity framework focused on the delivery of specific treatment elements shown to be effective, rather than a prescriptive sequencing of every program element, may be more effective when trying to engage and retain clients whose circumstances make it difficult to follow a regimented program schedule. Practice Considerations JDTCs should adopt evidence-based case management that takes into account participants' special needs and allows some flexibility in the application of case management practices.

Incentives are typically applied if clients progress through the program and if their families cooperate with the various program phases. Sanctions are generally administered if a juvenile does not comply with the program (for example, missing scheduled events or therapy), tests positive on a drug test or misses a drug screen, does not attend a court hearing, commits a crime, or fails to follow the provisions of his or her probation or treatment. Evidence Training staff on the principles of contingency management and using sanctions and incentives can enhance the program's capacity. Practice Considerations Contingency management strategies are often implemented in less than optimal ways because of challenges in training staff to understand and use these principles. JDTCs should use data to monitor the implementation of incentives and sanctions on an ongoing basis, reviewing their effectiveness and ensuring that they maintain an appropriate incentives-to-sanctions ratio. JDTCs would like to expand the number and variety of incentives.

Overview To reconcile the two facets of incentives and sanctions described in this guideline statement, the objective is to base them on the participant's competency and individualized treatment protocol. Behavioral contracts allow JDTCs to remain both consistent and individualized because if a youth breaks the contract, he or she cannot say that the response is unfair. When a youth does say that the situation is unfair, he or she often wants to be taken seriously. Evidence Youth generally perceive that counselors and JDTC staff treat them fairly. Practice Considerations JDTCs should meet with the youth to create a list of incentives and sanctions and update them every 60 to 90 days.

Unfortunately, many of these behaviors are punished in the JDTC model (they are considered violations of court order and JDTC program guidelines) and result in eventual stays in detention or in the assignment of fees. Detention should be used sparingly and only as a last resort. Evidence Research shows that detention is the most commonly used sanction in some JDTCs. Practice Considerations Detention is the least effective and most expensive way to affect changes in behavior.

Discretionary Justice: Looking Inside a Juvenile Drug Court. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press. Overview Case management both facilitates a youth's participation in and, ideally, successful completion of a JDTC program, ensuring that the youth and family are connected to and can access needed supports and services. It also maintains public safety by monitoring each youth's compliance with the requirements and sanctions that the court or probation impose. Maintaining a balance between these responsibilities is important for a JDTC program to be effective. Evidence Case management ensures that the JDTC actually works, both for the youth served and for his or her community. Practice Considerations The balance of case management and supervision, along with monitoring, should be achieved in the context of addressing the youth's needs holistically. This requires individualizing case management and supervision plans. It also will demand effective engagement of the parents or guardians. This balance will also provide the context in which decisions are made about the length of court supervision, the treatment programs to which participants are referred, the frequency of drug tests, and other services to which the youth are referred.

Discretionary Justice: Looking Inside a Juvenile Drug Court. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press. Overview Every drug court uses urinalysis for drug testing, and some also conduct oral fluid analysis and use breathalyzers to detect alcohol. Evidence The percentage of youth who failed to appear for drug testing in one study was significantly and positively associated with an increased likelihood for program failure. Further, youth with higher percentages of missed (and positive) drug tests were more likely to fail to complete the program. Thus, youth's failure to appear for drug testing during the initial phase is a warning sign for youth at high risk of program failure. Practice Considerations Drug testing should be random, observed, frequent, and sensitive to any potential trauma the youth has experienced.

Reno, NV: National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. Available online: Overview Many JDTCs employ sanctioning models with a reasonable tolerance for return to use, consistent with what is known about successful recovery. Tolerance for return to use should be determined on an individual basis. Evidence Research shows that return to use is an expected aspect of recovery for many youth. Treatment and sanctions are often confused with one another, however, and more restrictive forms of treatment may be assigned in response to violations, rather than being based on an assessment of the youth's treatment needs. Practice Considerations A positive drug screen may result in a minor sanction within the first 30 days of a participant's enrollment in the JDTC, but a similar occurrence in the final phase of the JDTC process would be met with a more serious sanction. Recovery high schools provide safe learning environments within larger schools to provide peer support in small groups. These programs support recovery and enhance academic performance.

The continuum should also include prevention of return to use and other ongoing care. Although the focus is on treating substance use and related behaviors, JDTCs must be aware that youth and families will have other needs that often contribute to and are the result of their substance use. Therefore, youth and families should have access to other service providers who can help meet those needs. Evidence In addition to comprehensive treatment and other options, JDTCs should arrange for adolescent-specific (and family-specific, as applicable) care as part of their continuum. Research shows that using adolescent-specific treatment approaches in particular is directly related to retention and treatment success. Practice Considerations For a JDTC to be able to refer youth and families to a broad continuum of treatment and related options for services, the court must identify all organizations and agencies it will depend on for such services and involve them in the planning process.

The role of a state-level prevention support system in promoting high-quality implementation and sustainability of evidence-based programs. American Journal of Community Psychology 50(3-4):386-401. Overview It is critical for JDTCs to identify providers that use evidence-based treatment approaches and models. JDTCs are advised to refer participants to substance treatment programs that feature family therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy. JDTCs should not refer participants to standard community services, stand-alone self-help treatment, or generic counseling programs that do not incorporate family therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, and/or cognitive behavioral therapy components. Evidence The treatment modalities identified below showed evidence of beneficial effects (relative to practice as usual or no treatment) in at least two independent study samples after adjusting for methodological differences between studies. These types of treatment modalities were associated with significant reductions in substance use among youth and were consistently more effective than more generic types of \"practice as usual\" or \"mixed counseling\" programs that do not follow a unified approach or model for providing treatment. Practice Considerations Evidence-based treatment modalities include, but are not limited to, the following: Additional Resources For more information on these treatment modalities, visit: For more information on this guideline, refer to page 34 in 1Tanner-Smith, E.E., Steinka-Fry, K.T., Kettrey, Treatment Effectiveness: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Nashville, TN: Vanderbilt University, Peabody Research Institute. Overview Once a JDTC identifies the treatment and other service needs of youth and their families and identifies providers using evidence-based treatment and service models, programs must ensure that providers implement those practices with fidelity to the model. Evidence While the desire for effective interventions has grown, the means to implement them effectively have not kept pace, often resulting in failed replications and adaptations when taking a single-site program to scale. Practice Considerations Organizations must be ready to implement interventions; key aspects of readiness include a combination of factors inside the organization and within the context in which it operates.

Evidence Evidence strongly supports a greater variety and quantity of services in JDTC programs as well as connections with community providers to deliver those services. Practice Considerations Relative to evidence-based treatment services\u2014and regardless of the need they seek to address\u2014an important consideration is the definition of evidence-based. Without assurance of the scientific rigor through which this term is claimed for any given treatment or service model, JDTCs should ask providers to clarify exactly what it means. Courts should ask questions to determine the models that are used, evidence showing the models' efficacy (and the populations with which they are effective), and whether the providers are implementing the models with fidelity.

Available online: Overview An approach that uses the concepts of positive youth development to refocus juvenile justice interventions is known as positive youth justice. This conforms to the ultimate goal for youth in the juvenile justice system to become productive adult citizens. Evidence A systematic review of positive youth development programs showed that a vast array of approaches contributed to positive youth behavior outcomes and also reduced or prevented youth's involvement in problem behaviors, including substance use and delinquent activities. Research on JDTCs revealed that participants need more prosocial activities and opportunities and also noted that it is a challenge to understand and impact youth's peer associations. JDTCs' ability to affect youth's peer associations appears mixed across courts. Practice Considerations The positive youth justice model has 12 key components that arise from the intersection of two essential assets (learning/doing or building competence, and attaching/belonging or positive healthy relationships) with six different life domains (work, education, community, relationships, health, and creativity).

Click on each circle below to navigate through the guidelines. | | Overview In practice, JDTCs find it difficult to provide age-appropriate, gender-specific, and culturally and linguistically competent services. In addition, research points to disparities in the outcomes associated with JDTCs. Evidence White youth were more likely to complete the program and had lower recidivism rates than minority youth. Girls were more likely to complete the program and had lower recidivism rates than boys. Older youth had better outcomes than those who were younger. When youth have co-occurring disorders and histories of abuse or other traumatic experiences, they are less likely to succeed in a JDTC. Practice Considerations It is important to monitor and to work toward equivalent outcomes.

Developing Juvenile Court Practices on Process Standards: A Systematic Review and Qualitative Synthesis. Fairfax, VA: George Mason University. Overview Key JDTC stakeholders agree that although termination should be a last resort, it is important to have strict guidelines to determine when to terminate a youth from the program. Evidence The strongest predictors for successfully completing or leaving a JDTC have been shown to be factors related to process, such as the use of incentives and sanctions, the consistency of implementing behavioral contingencies with each participant, and youth's retention in community-based substance treatment programs. Practice Considerations Because consistent evidence exists that successful program completion depends on the court's structure and participants' commitment to the process, JDTCs are encouraged to work with each participant individually to find a structure that maximizes the use of incentives, uses graduated sanctions appropriately and consistently, and supports family engagement in meaningful and empowering ways. Appropriate responses to violations committed early in the process could have a positive impact on participants' progress in the program. Referring youth to evidence-based treatment programs and supporting continued involvement also increases the likelihood that youth will complete the program successfully.

Overview Researchers recommend that juvenile drug courts develop or improve robust management information systems to systematically collect data that provide better evidence of program viability and reliability and help secure future funding. Evidence Systems to capture and manage data should focus on continuous quality improvement and not just serve as efforts to satisfy compliance. Practice Considerations Perceptual assessments of drug court staff have found that staffers often view their court's data collection processes as inadequate and are dissatisfied with the process.

The judge's role in leading the coordination of services is a critical component of a comprehensive approach. A steering (or policy) committee can provide a forum to discuss issues pertaining to the coordination of services. Case-level service coordinators are needed. The court should monitor service agencies' compliance with court referrals. Creative approaches should be used to provide services, and it is important to provide cross-training so court staff (including the judge) and service providers can understand the context in which each person operates.

Although team members share in the goal of providing services to youth, individual partners may interpret a youth's action in different ways. This can lead to a lapse in or duplication of services, overall confusion, and even different institutional outcomes for youth. [2](#1-2-2m) Practice Considerations [3](#1-2-3m)(a) the judge serves as the JDTC chairperson and has ultimate accountability and oversight for the team members; (b) the JDTC coordinator is the primary point of contact between the judge and the rest of the team; (c) the clinical treatment supervisor (or clinical treatment liaison) provides the substance use treatment perspective for the team; (d) the juvenile probation officer (and/or a juvenile probation supervisor) supervises and monitors JDTC participants outside of the court setting; (e) the JDTC treatment provider is responsible for all related treatment services; (f) the state's attorney (or prosecutor) represents the state, helps identify eligible JDTC participants, and participates in court hearings; (g) the public defender represents the expressed interests of and advocates for the youth participants; and (h) the school representative presents the schools' perspective so the JDTC is aware of concerns and school-based resources that may serve the team.

[3](#2-3-3m)It is also important to assess co-occurring mental health issues because youth with co-occurring disorders are less likely to successfully complete the program. [4](#2-3-4m) Practice Considerations [5](#2-3-5m)A trained clinician typically conducts the highest quality (i.e., validated and reliable) mental health evaluations, which allows JDTC staff to learn of a youth's mental health issues and increases the likelihood that the youth will succeed in the program. [6](#2-3-6m)Also, the JDTC team must perform reassessments on a regular basis.

[2](#2-5-2m)Like other minority groups that are disproportionately represented, LGBTQI-GNC youth are at a higher risk for many negative outcomes, including homelessness; sexual, physical, and mental abuse; continuous juvenile justice system involvement; bullying; and suicide. [3](#2-5-3m) Practice Considerations [4](#2-5-4m)Youth-focused cultural competency should be part of initial and recurring training for all JDTC members. A wide variety of youth-oriented cultural competency training programs are available for JDTCs. The JDTC should also track success rates to serve as indicators of equitable access to all youth and their families. [5](#2-5-5m)It is important to address the needs of girls in a developmentally appropriate way, especially in regard to limiting how far girls are formally processed into the juvenile justice system unless they pose a serious threat to public safety. Gender- and culturally responsive, trauma-informed, and developmentally appropriate approaches should be increased. OJJDP recognizes the unique challenges that LGBTQI-GNC youth face in the juvenile justice system and understands that it is important to provide competent trainings, programs, and guidance to help juvenile justice professionals better respond to these young people.

A true collaborative relationship between the JDTC team and the family appreciates the important role that parents and guardians will play in managing participants' behavior outside of court. Evidence [2](#3-1-2m)A youth whose family member attends court sessions is significantly more compliant with the JDTC rules. [3](#3-1-3m)Families' distrust and misunderstanding based on their initial contact with the JDTC can undermine efforts to involve them in the process. [4](#3-1-4m) Practice Considerations [5](#3-1-5m)Family therapy can help fully engage parents and guardians in the JDTC process. [6](#3-1-6m)Courts can help parents and guardians build skills in effective supervision and discipline, and intensive interventions such as parent training classes may increase the likelihood that these positive parenting practices will continue after the family's involvement with the JDTC. [7](#3-1-7m) One suggestion is to appoint a liaison to help the family navigate the process, understand its rights, and answer questions. Parents and guardians should receive information in a format that is easily accessible, both verbally and in writing, and that takes language barriers into account. Parents and guardians also desire better home-based support to reinforce treatment plans. The JDTC team and providers should offer support, information, and resources to families that are relevant to the youth's needs and that will help the family ensure the youth's success.

[4](#3-2-4m) Practice Considerations [5](#3-2-5m)The principles of procedural justice are important here. First, youth and families need to participate in the proceedings before the judge reaches a decision. Second, youth and families must perceive that the judge is showing neutrality in making a decision.

Behavioral contingencies must be individualized for each youth, but the assigned conditions should be applied consistently so the youth knows what to expect. [2](#3-3-2m) Evidence [3](#3-3-3m)Sanctions applied inconsistently can actually reinforce undesirable behavior instead of diminish it. [4](#3-3-4m)Individualization of programming coupled with the consistent application of judicial discretion allows for constructive therapeutic treatment. [5](#3-3-5m)An effective way for the judge to achieve the JDTC goals is to apply the principles of behavior modification through positive reinforcement.

[2](#4-2-2m)Treatment plans spell out the intensity of services for each youth. Evidence [3](#4-2-3m)Results improved when programs balanced the need for fidelity with the need for flexibility. [4](#4-2-4m)Strict adherence to fidelity reduced parent engagement but increased youth's satisfaction with the program. Parents and guardians stated that they expected service providers to treat them more as peers and to accommodate requests for changes because of family needs. [5](#4-2-5m)Lack of flexibility when implementing interventions may also reduce practitioner confidence and commitment for delivering the program as intended. [6](#4-2-6m) Practice Considerations - providing \"a single point of contact for multiple health and social service systems\"; - advocating for the participant and his or her family; - being \"flexible, community-based, and client-oriented\"; and - helping the participant and family manage other related needs. [7](#4-2-7m) - the different types and causes of addiction and the various problems associated with substance use disorders; - the state of the art of evidence-based \"treatment, recovery, relapse prevention, and continuing care\" to address substance use disorders and any associated problems; - the important role that family, community, and support systems play in treatment and recovery; - the different options for engaging insurance and health maintenance providers to cover the cost of treatment and recovery services; and - how to integrate individual needs, including culturally relevant needs and those specific to youth with special needs, into treatment and other critical services will provide the best case management.

Based on key ideas drawn from behavioral research and juvenile drug court practice, JDTCs should implement a system of incentives and sanctions that are immediate, certain, consistent, fair, of appropriate intensity, goal oriented, graduated, individualized, and therapeutically sound. [3](#5-1-3m)Research shows that there should be four incentives for every sanction. [4](#5-1-4m) Practice Considerations [5](#5-1-5m)This is likely to involve dedicated staff who can work to secure incentives that are not currently available, such as passes for movies or bowling. [6](#5-1-6m)Verbal praise can also be used to augment behavioral management strategies when resources for incentives are constrained. Praise can be a powerful behavioral motivator when applied under the proper conditions.

[2](#5-2-2m)Incentives are important to the success of JDTCs, and youth indicate that they appreciate the rewards. Increasing incentives can improve graduation rates. [3](#5-2-3m)In one study, the youth noted that earning rewards was a highlight of the JDTC hearings. [4](#5-2-4m)In another study, the proportion of incentives (relative to sanctions) was a significant predictor of graduation.

[6](#5-2-6m) Practice Considerations [7](#5-2-7m)Also, the way in which JDTCs communicate with youth about a particular sanction (e.g., confrontational or supportive) determines how it is received. [8](#5-2-8m)Individualization of incentives and sanctions should be aligned with the youth's proximal (short term, such as not using drugs this week) and distal (long term, such as obtaining a GED) goals.

[2](#5-3-2m)The research on how detention impacts adolescent development and mental health is quite clear. The use of detention actually increases the likelihood of recidivism and negatively impacts future employment and educational opportunities. Detention and length of detention are also related to JDTC failure. [3](#5-3-3m)The amount of time spent in detention is significantly related to JDTC program graduation rates, program failure, and new delinquency charges. [4](#5-3-4m)In one study, results indicated that a youth placed in detention is almost eight times more likely to fail to graduate from a JDTC program than is a youth who was never in detention. [5](#5-3-5m) Practice Considerations [6](#5-3-6m)Courts should assess the use of detention and consider replacing it as much as possible with effective, lower cost sanctions. JDTCs should also consider whether the assignment of fees is a valuable strategy. Most commonly, fees are assigned based on the youth's behavior, but the parents pay. [7](#5-3-7m)Some parents and guardians feel it is not fair to pay fees when youth are noncompliant. [8](#5-3-8m)Perhaps even more of a concern for JDTCs is the finding that if parents or guardians believe they may be assessed fees, some of them will hide noncompliant youth behaviors to avoid payment.

New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press. | | Guideline 5.4 Overview Evidence [1](#5-4-1m)The benefits of intensive monitoring, however, are mixed. Although it can create opportunities to better address youth's needs, intensive monitoring can also lead to the detection of more violations of program requirements and the administration of ad hoc sanctions, resulting in a negative view of youth and lower graduation rates. [2](#5-4-2m)When the court focuses heavily on violations and noncompliance, it develops perceptions about how it will or will not be able to work with each youth, which may serve to limit the use of contingency management that could change behavior and shape the youth's identity.

Evidence [2](#5-5-2m) Practice Considerations [3](#5-5-3m)JDTCs should develop a standard for testing but increase the frequency as needed for individual youth. [4](#5-5-4m)Research has pointed to a consensus that testing should occur twice a week initially and then weekly during the JDTC's latter stages. [5](#5-5-5m)The court should also use spot testing when staff suspect that the youth might be under the influence of a substance. If JDTCs cannot afford frequent testing, they can use a random testing schedule in which the youth calls in daily to check if he or she has been selected for testing. [6](#5-5-6m)The frequency of testing should be the last supervision level lifted. [7](#5-5-7m)Tampering should be seen as a deliberate act of noncompliance, yet most tampering can be eliminated by employing direct observation for urine and other related collections.

Journal of Groups in Addiction & Recovery 2:128-161. | | Guideline 6.1 Overview [1](#6-1-1m) Evidence [2](#6-1-2m)A clearly identified referral process should be in place to provide effective coordination for families from court to community. Because families and youth often find it difficult to access and attend treatment services, they should have the opportunity to participate in discussions about where these services are located in the community. Practice Considerations [3](#6-1-3m)Without this involvement, the court may be limited in its knowledge of and ability to refer youth and families to a range of providers. The availability of high-quality treatment resources that span the full continuum will vary in each jurisdiction. It is important to sustain available treatment resources and find ways to develop viable alternatives where gaps exist. [4](#6-1-4m)For example, JDTCs are encouraged to look for ways to align the needs of local providers with available state funding.

Practice Considerations - Assertive continuing care. Programs that provide integrated and coordinated case management services for youth after they are discharged from outpatient or inpatient treatment, including home visits, client advocacy for support services, and integrated social support services. - Behavioral therapy. Programs based on operant behavioral principles that use incentives (e.g., gift certificates) to reward abstinence and/or compliance with treatment. - Cognitive behavioral therapy. Programs based on theories of classical conditioning that focus on teaching adolescents coping skills, problem-solving skills, and cognitive restructuring techniques for dealing with stimuli that trigger substance use or cravings. - Family therapy. Programs based on ecological approaches that actively involve family members in treatment and address issues of family functioning, parenting skills, and family communication skills. - Motivational enhancement therapy. Programs that use supportive and nonconfrontational therapeutic techniques to encourage motivation to change based on clients' readiness to change and self-efficacy for behavior change. - Motivational enhancement therapy/cognitive behavioral therapy. Programs that use a combination of motivational enhancement and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. - Multiservice packages. Programs that combine two or more of these approaches. These programs use a combination of behavioral, cognitive behavioral therapy, family therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, pharmacotherapies, and/or group and mixed counseling in a comprehensive package.

[2](#6-3-2m)Poorly implemented evidence-based practices can produce no better outcomes than locally developed programs that do not have an established evidence base. [3](#6-3-3m)Programs with higher levels of implementation quality are associated with better outcomes for the youth served. [4](#6-3-4m) Practice Considerations [5](#6-3-5m)Organizations that are not ready to take on an evidence-based practice typically produce poor results; eventually the intervention is de-adopted and replaced. [6](#6-3-6m)It is important to consider complexities to implementation. To implement evidence-based treatments, agencies and clinicians must be trained in how to administer the intervention and adhere to the treatment manual and must be open to adjustments to practice to maintain fidelity. [7](#6-3-7m)Courts and providers should discuss and agree on these expectations to promote successful implementation.

Further, many youth face family dysfunction and many JDTCs view parents and other caregivers as risk factors to youth's substance use. [2](#6-4-2m)Thus, it is clear that a one-size-fits-all approach in JDTC programs will not provide appropriate treatment and support for all youth, [3](#6-4-3m)nor can JDTCs provide all of the services necessary to meet youth's diverse needs. Evidence [4](#6-4-4m)In particular, wide-ranging services and supports are needed to address trauma, mental health, family issues, educational challenges, and criminal thinking. [5](#6-4-5m) Practice Considerations [6](#6-4-6m)These considerations are important so JDTCs can ensure their chosen providers are meeting the youth's and families' wide range of needs.

These conclusions may suggest that there are other nontreatment aspects of the JDTC experience that contribute to the disparate results with regard to outcomes for participants.

[2](#7-2-2m) Evidence [3](#7-2-3m)Incentives are important to JDTC success, and youth appreciate them. Increasing the application of incentives can improve rates of successful program completion. Conversely, when sanctions are not applied consistently, the court might view participants more negatively and termination rates might increase as a result.

Fairfax, VA: George Mason University. | | Guideline 7.3 Overview [1](#7-3-1m)It is particularly important to be able to track and monitor outcomes such as reoffending, return to substance use, educational enrollment, employment, and program completion and termination. Evidence [2](#7-3-2m)Several studies found that some practices can negatively affect staff and can affect data quality when leaders require data collection only for compliance and surveillance purposes. [3](#7-3-3m)It is also important to build the capacity to track factors that are shown to be related to JDTC outcomes. For instance, family cohesion is a strong protective factor for substance use and other problem behaviors. [4](#7-3-4m)Evidence supports the idea that JDTCs' relative effectiveness and the evidence-based treatments they provide can at least partially be attributed to the programs' capacity to \"alter well-established family (e.g., parent supervision)...risk factors for antisocial behavior in adolescents\". [5](#7-3-5m)Similarly, feedback from JDTCs indicates that friendship networks can be risk factors for return to use and/or continued delinquency. [6](#7-3-6m)Further, the effectiveness of JDTCs has been linked to the programs' ability to disrupt youth's associations with deviant peers. [7](#7-3-7m)In light of these findings, researchers recommend that courts focus on participants' peer networks. [8](#7-3-8m) Practice Considerations [9](#7-3-9m)Local JDTCs have varied capacities to collect data for evaluation and monitoring purposes, however, and many JDTCs lack comprehensive and accessible systems to do so.
