That delay will make sure the vaccines work as well as they can. For transplant recipients, researchers are looking at whether an extra dose might make the vaccines more effective. Extra dose French guidelines recommend a third Covid-19 dose for the immunocompromised, including organ recipients. Israel recently began giving an extra dose of the Pfizer vaccine to transplant patients and others with weak immune systems. Some U.S. transplant recipients seek out a third dose on their own in hopes of more protection even though the federal government hasn't "}
