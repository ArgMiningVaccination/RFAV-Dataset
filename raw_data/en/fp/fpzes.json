Homeopathy has grown in popularity with the public but is viewed with skepticism by medical academia and is still excluded from conventionally prescribed treatments. In recent years, homeopathy has been used in cancer care in Europe and other countries worldwide. This use raised the question if there is any benefit in utilizing this type of care with cancer patients. The purpose of this article is to explore the benefit of homeopathy in cancer care. Limited research has suggested that homeopathic remedies appear to cause cellular changes in some cancer cells. Some clinical studies of homeopathic remedies combined with conventional care have shown that homeopathic remedies improve quality of life, reduce symptom burden, and possibly improve survival in patients with cancer. The findings from several lab and clinical studies suggest that homeopathy might have some beneficial effect in cancer care. In recent times extensive research has been made to prove that homeopathy can give relief, as well as cure, even fatal diseases like cancers, tumors, renal failures and such. The action of Homeopathic medicines can now be proved. The treatments of many surgical cases are within the scope of homeopathic treatment and medication alone. With the help of scans, before and after treatment, we are able to prove that Homeopathy reduces the tumors and cures Although additional studies are needed to confirm these findings, given the low cost, minimal risks, and the potential magnitude of homeopathy's effects, this use might be considered in certain situations as an additional tool to integrate into cancer care Introduction Globally, over 600 million people use homoeopathy as a system of medicine to treat ailments. Of this, about 100 million are Indians and by 2017, the numbers are expected to climb to 160 million.[1] The role and efficacy of homeopathic medicines for treatment of malignant tumors is largely unknown and unproven so far. Homeopathic therapy is mainly used for supportive cancer care and some have suggested an integration of this therapy with conventional methods (Kassab, et al., 2009). However, in numerous studies, it has been found that orthodox medicine is not meeting the needs of some patients and that Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) may wholly or partly substitute for conventional medicines. Most patients indicate that their problems improve with CAM (Ernst, 2005; Frenkel, 2010).1,2 Prefatory note written by Dr. Robert cooper in his book I find is very meaningful when we are talking about Integrative medicine. \"If the improvement is to be brought about in medicine as in other branches of knowledge, we must diverge from the beaten tracks, the probability being that the truth is to be found in unexpected directions. But not only is any divergence4 from ordinary views likely to meet with opposition, owing to the preconceived opinions of mankind, but it has to encounter a much more serious opposition should it at all run counter to existing commercial interest.\"4 Integrative medicine is an estabilished movement in developed countries. i am confident that it is the direction medicine and health care must take to address demands from patients, dissatisfaction of practioners and the worsening economy of worldwide. About Homeopathy Homeopathy is a scientific approach to achieving and maintaining balance on the energetic level. \"In the healthy human state, the spirit-like life force (autocracy) that enlivens the material organism as dynamis, governs without restriction and keeps all parts of the organism in admirable, harmonious, vital operation, as regards both feelings and functions, so that our indwelling, rational spirit can freely avail itself of this living, healthy instrument for the higher purposes of our existence.\". Somehow Hahnemann knew that we are governed by something more than just our bodies. Homeopathy is a holistic system of medicine which has been used by many practitioners to treat cancer patients. There are historical accounts about homeopathy treatment of cancer and modern literature also gives several case studies of homeopathy for cancer treatment. Homeopathc approach towards cancer There are several different treatment philosophies and approaches for using homeopathy to treat individuals with cancer. Often times practitioners that use homeopathy in the treatment of cancer use a combination of these approaches. One approach is to use homeopathic remedies to target the tumors themselves. In this case, the homeopath selects remedies which match the symptom picture of the tumor itself (e.g. Conium Maculatum for hard immovable tumors that develop slowly). Homeopaths using this approach might also consider other symptoms (such as the individual's food cravings, disposition, etc), but their primary focus is to target the tumor and reverse its growth. Some physician homeopaths also give remedies at the tumor site itself (in the form of an injection) to more aggressively stimulate a response.1 Another approach is to use homeopathic remedies to assist in healing the patient's eliminative channels (kidneys, urinary tract, lymphatic system, liver, etc), and strengthen cell detoxification. In this case, the homeopath may use drainage remedies. These are low potency combination remedies that are used to target specific systems, or detoxify particular substances (e.g. heavy metals, etc). Homeopaths using this approach select the drainage remedy based on an analysis of the case - or they may use an electro-dermal diagnostic tool, such as the Quantum machine. Still another approach is to use homeopathy to address the overall constitution of the patient. In this case (called the classical approach), the homeopath does a complete interview of the patient's mental, emotional, and physical symptoms and then selects the best match accordingly. Often the best selected constitutional remedy will directly affect the tumor. By assisting the body in addressing and resolving the energy that underlies the tumor, it can result in complete elimination of the tumor. The best selected constitutional remedy can also support drainage and detoxification, although this is not the primary focus of a classical prescriber.1,2,3 Specific Homeopathic Remedies for Cancer: One of the most frequently. recommended homeopathic remedies for cancer is Arsenicum Album. Arsenicum Album is a primary remedy for cancer and is often recommended for individuals with terminal cancer that are entering into the death process. It helps the individual confront and deal with their fear of death - feelings of being stuck in limbo, not knowing what lies ahead, not knowing what to expect, feeling terrified of the transition, afraid to let go of their life. When used appropriately, it can be a powerful tool for assisting individuals in coming to greater peace about the death process, enabling them to embrace the transition with greater spiritual centeredness. 3,6,7 Arsenicum Album is also of great value to individuals that have just been diagnosed with cancer and are gripped with profound fear - fear of cancer, fear that they will never get better, fear of death, fear of not having enough money to sustain the treatment, fear of not getting the needed medical care. In this state, the individual sees the cancer as being bigger than themselves and bigger than their own ability to heal themselves. They feel powerless over the cancer, seeing it as being 100 feet tall and seeing themselves as being very small.3,6,7 This is not to say that the fears that come with a cancer diagnosis are not justified, but that these fears in an of themselves severely weaken the immune system of the cancer individual. By taking Arsenicum Album (when indicated), it can help the individual reconnect with a greater spiritual center, such that they see themselves and their immune system as being bigger than the cancer. 3,6,7 Arsenicum album may also be indicated for family members and friends that are gripped with these same types of fears - terror that their family member will die, that there are no therapies available, that the situation is out of control, that a new or different doctor is needed, that people are not taking the situation seriously enough. In these cases, Arsenicum Album can help the individual let go of some of these fears, making it easier for them to affirm the ability of their friend or family member to heal themselves. 3,6,7 On a physical level, Arsenicum Album helps the body release fear and tension held in the kidneys, adrenals, and nervous system. This sometimes correlates with the detoxification of the heavy metal arsenic from these areas as well. In some cases, Arsenicum Album can be instrumental in actually turning the cancer around, arresting tumor growth and empowering the individual's immune system to turn the disease around. Some of the physical symptoms that are included in the profile of an individual needing Arsenicum Album are: Burning pains, better with heat (this is specific to arsenicum album - for the majority of other homeopathic remedies indicated for burning pains, the pain is better with cold application. is one of the few remedies in which the pain is better with heat.) Burning pains, felt deep within the body, burning pain in the bones, the nervous system, the digestive tract, etc Neck stiffness Craves sour foods and drinks Cold hands and feet, ice cold feeling, lack of body heat Itchy scalp Eczema, especially on the hands and on the scalp Key mental/emotional symptoms associated with Arsenicum Album include: Fear of death, disease, cancer Survival issues Despair of recovery Fear of poverty, that there is not enough money to support oneself, that the insurance company is being stingy, that everywhere one goes there is not enough Perfectionism, fear of making a mistake which will be severely detrimental to one's health and/or financial situation Obsessive/compulsive, rigid behavior, ritualistic, the tremendous fear drives the individual to a strict adherence to a protocol or routine, the feeling is that if they divert from this routine, they will not survive physically and/or financially3,6,7 How effective is homeopathy in the treatment of cancer? In the US, most alternative health care professionals use homeopathy in combination with other approaches (nutritional and immune system support, diet and detoxification programs, etc), so it's not typically considered as a primary or stand-alone therapy for cancer. However, when used correctly, and in combination with necessary therapies, it can be an amazingly powerful tool for empowering someone to heal themselves of cancer. There are many cases in homeopathic literature (from other countries where homeopathy is more commonly used for cancer) in which the correct homeopathic recommendation resulted in the resolution of tumors, reversal of the cancer process, and recovery by the patient. Individual studies have shown that homoeopathic medicines can be used to mitigate the adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Also, homeopathy has an excellent track record in the treatment of animals with cancer and there is much anecdotal evidence that certain remedies (when correctly selected) are effective in reversing the cancer process. The historical and international experiences with homoeopathic medicines in a wide variety of acute and chronic illnesses, combined with a growing body of scientific evidence and a benign safety profile would suggest a place for homoeopathic treatment in an integrated medical approach to cancer treatment. 3 Conclusion People facing a new diagnosis of cancer are unsettled by their prognosis and treatment options, and they often seek to integrate complementary modalities into their conventional care plan, hoping to improve their chances of cure and decrease side effects. Integrative Oncology, will definitely help for both practitioners and consumers on the emerging to fight with the disease in better way.
