But the study is unlikely to end the increasingly charged debate about vaccine safety. The study examined whether thimerosal \u2014 a mercury-containing vaccine preservative that was almost entirely eliminated from childhood vaccines by 2002 \u2014 is associated with neurological or certain psychological problems in children ages 7 to 10. Some parents' groups and prominent legislators contend that thimerosal has caused an epidemic of childhood autism. Several studies have examined this question and found no evidence that thimerosal is associated with autism. The most recent study did not assess thimerosal's association with autism directly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conducting a separate autism and thimerosal study that is expected to be published next year. In this study, published yesterday in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from the C.D.C. and several managed-care organizations subjected 1,047 children to 42 neurological and psychological exams, which included I.Q. tests, how well children recalled a list of names and whether they could repeat the names backward, their manual dexterity, and whether they stuttered or had tics. The researchers also took detailed medical histories to determine whether the subjects' mothers were exposed to thimerosal while pregnant, and how much thimerosal the children were exposed to in their first seven months of life. After subjecting the data to nearly 400 different statistical measures, researchers found 19 different possible associations between thimerosal and various mental outcomes \u2014 most of which suggested that thimerosal was actually beneficial. Researchers largely dismissed these associations as statistical flukes. \"By chance alone, with that number of tests, we would estimate that 5 percent of the results would be significant,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the C.D.C. \"And that's what we found.\" The lone worrisome result was that, among boys, the study found an association between thimerosal and tics, which are involuntary movements or sounds. At least one earlier study had found a similar association. But Dr. Schuchat said that researchers had made no distinction between transitory tics \u2014 those that soon disappear and are not considered clinically important \u2014 and permanent, serious or disfiguring tics. \"That particular finding is being evaluated further,\" Dr. Schuchat said. Dr. Jeffrey Baker, a pediatrician and vaccine expert who is director of the history of medicine program at Duke University, said that the study's findings should be reassuring for parents. \"This study will further strengthen a growing consensus among researchers that there is no real evidence that thimerosal in vaccines led to any actual harm,\" Dr. Baker said. But Sallie Bernard, executive director of SafeMinds, a nonprofit parent organization whose members contend that thimerosal injured their children, said the study was inconclusive. Ms. Bernard served on a board of consultants that helped design and oversee the study, but she withdrew her support for the published version of the study, saying its conclusions were not supported by the underlying data. \"There are some red flags here,\" Ms. Bernard said. Nearly 5,000 families have filed claims with the federal government contending that vaccines caused their children to become autistic. Even if the government dismisses their claims, many families have vowed to continue their fight in the courts. Since thimerosal's removal from vaccines, there has been no evidence that autism is on the decline. "}
