While they may have once been seen as a niche and slightly unreliable alternative to regular sprays and roll-ons, there are now so many options available-from deodorants so luxe you'll want to show them off in your bathroom cabinet to formulas so delicately fragranced that you'll be batting off the compliments. So why exactly are so many of us making the switch from regular deodorants? A common reason is their use of aluminum and its association with breast cancer and the sensitivity it can cause. But is there actually a link, or is it just scary hearsay? \"The debate is still ongoing as to whether or not aluminum in antiperspirants causes breast cancer in women,\" says clean beauty expert Jenny Duranski. A good amount of studies have been conducted over the past two decades questioning the safety of the ingredient. To date, the overarching consensus has been that results are inconclusive and more scientific data is needed. (Although one fairly recent 2017 study, found that using aluminum-based antiperspirants frequently, particularly before the age of 30, may increase the risk of breast cancer.) The bottom line? The jury is still kind of still out, but for many people, making the switch to natural deodorants is the preferred choice. What else is there to think about? It's important to keep in mind that aluminum is the active ingredient in antiperspirants that actually keeps you from sweating, so, no matter how great of a natural deodorant you find, \"it will give you odor protection, but wetness protection isn't always at the top of the list,\" notes Duranski. Also worth noting: \"Not every formula is going to be a perfect fit for everyone because everyone's skin and microbiome is different and may react differently to various ingredients,\" explains Emily Koko, Assistant Buyer for Credo Beauty. \"Sometimes it's a matter of trial and error,\" Where to start? We suggest starting with our pick of the best natural deodorants for women. [Kopari Aluminum-Free Deodorant at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ursa-Major-Hoppin-Deodorant-Ounces/dp/B017Y86FHM/?tag=byrdie-onsite-backup-20) Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Schmidts-Deodorant-Stick-Cedarwood-Juniper/dp/B018K3HD62/?tag=byrdie-onsite-backup-20) Kopari Aluminum-Free Deodorant Good value Hydrating formula Glides on easily Stays fresh all day Can melt if left in the heat Byrdie editors have tried pretty much every natural deodorant, but few come close to rivaling this universally-beloved favorite. It relies largely on coconut oil (which is naturally antibacterial and antimicrobial), as well as sage oil, for odor protection that's on par with that of antiperspirants. Also nice: It comes in four scents plus an unscented version. A word to the wise, because of the coconut oil in the formula, it can get melty and runny if it gets too hot, so keep it in a cool spot. Price at time of publish: $14 Type: Oil | Active Ingredients: Coconut and sage oils, coconut water, Saccharomyces ferment | Size: 2 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Stone Crystal Deodorant Stick Long-lasting Contains a single ingredient Inexpensive No scented options Looking for a minimal ingredient list? How about just one ingredient? That's right, uno\u2014you'll only find natural mineral salts in this deodorant stone. It works by leaving an invisible barrier on the skin that protects you from bacteria-creating odors without leaving behind any stains, stickiness, or residue. One stone is guaranteed to last you at least a year, and it's also endorsed by Cancer Treatment Centers for extra reassurance on its safety. It's also completely unscented-ideal if you're opposed to fragrance in your products. Price at time of publish: $8 Type: Solid crystal | Active Ingredients: Potassium alum | Size: 4.3 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Gel N\u00e9cessaire The Deodorant Gel Glides on easily Stays fresh all day A little goes a long way Packaging could be improved This newly-launched natural deodorant gel is the latest addition to our favorite minimalist body care range, N\u00e9cessaire -and let's just say it's got everyone at Byrdie HQ excited. The formula is everything you would want from your deodorant (think effective ingredients that work together seamlessly to block out odor) without the use of hidden nasties like aluminum, parabens, and synthetic fragrance. It also dries clear and helps to keep bumpy bits and ingrown hairs at bay with the addition of 5% AHA and niacinamide. Panthenol and chamomile flower extract also soothe irritation and sensitive skin. Price at time of publish: $15 Type: Gel | Active Ingredients: Mandelic Agent Nateur holi(stick) No. 3 Deodorant Luxe packaging Great scent Ideal for very sensitive skin Needs to be reapplied throughout the day Chic, chic, chic with a capital C. Everything from the minimalistic black and white packaging to the scent (derived from eucalyptus and lavender oils) screams sophistication. It's made from food-grade ingredients, including organic coconut oil, avocado butter, and beeswax, alongside healing essential oils that soothe sensitive skin while keeping you smelling super fresh. It truly defies every stereotype that comes to mind when you think of natural deodorant, making it a luxurious treat that's worth every penny-particularly given how well it works, too. Price at time of publish: $21 Type: Oil | Active Ingredients: Coconut oil, baking soda | Size: 1.7 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Scent Corpus Naturals Cedar Flora Natural Deodorant Won't irritate sensitive skin Glides on easily Stays fresh all day Doesn't leave a residue on clothes Scent may be too strong for some \"Corpus uses naturally-derived enzymes to balance bacteria and odor, and this has the most lovely scent,\" says Koko. Credit the perfect balance of cedar, white musk, and jasmine that make this smell more like a perfume than a natural deodorant. It's another great pick for sensitive skin since it uses tapioca starch rather than baking soda. Price at time of publish: $26 Type: Solid stick | Active Ingredients: Diatomaceous earth, Saccharomyces ferment | Size: 2.6 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best for Workout Buffs Ursa Major Hoppin' Fresh Deodorant Feels cooling and soothing on skin Stays fresh all day Great scent Can dry out over time This cooling natural deodorant will keep you feeling fresh through hot yoga or the sweatiest of spin classes; credit the addition of peppermint and eucalyptus. It's also cooling upon application, making it great to use post-workout. Koko also gives it bonus points for delivering all-day protection and the inclusion of soothing aloe to soothe and hydrate the underarms. You'll also find moisture-absorbing kaolin on its ingredients list as well as odor-busting baking soda and hops. If we have one complaint, it's that it does dry out in its pot over time. Price at time of publish: $18 Type: Solid stick | Active Ingredients: Hops, kaolin, aloe vera | Size: 2.6 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Personalized Nala Personalized Deodorant Comes in different strengths and scents Long-lasting Doesn't leave a residue on clothes Testers say that you need more than the brand's recommended two swipes for long-lasting protection This option from Nala allows you to not only pick the scent of your deodorant but select your preferred level of odor protection, too. There are three different scents to choose from, plus an unscented option, and you can select from sensitive (which is baking soda-free), regular, or extra strength. When it comes to natural deodorant, one size does not fit all, so this is a great way to mix and match to determine what your body needs. Price at time of publish: $29 Type: Solid stick | Active Ingredients: Arrowroot powder, tapioca powder, kaolin | Size: 2.2 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best for Sensitive Skin Kaia Naturals Charcoal Deodorant Sakura Blossom Fragrance is naturally derived Suitable for very sensitive skin Glides on easily Can leave a faint residue Rather than using baking soda, which can be irritating for some, this relies on activated charcoal to help remove impurities and neutralize odors, says Koko. It's part of the reason it's a choice for those with sensitive skin (because irritation under your arms is really the pits). There's also only natural fragrance in the formula, which has a springy floral scent. Testers say, however, that it can leave a faint residue behind. Price at time of publish: $25 Type: Solid stick | Active Ingredients: Activated charcoal, salicylic acid | Size: 2.3 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Unisex Schmidt's Deodorant Stick Great selection of scents Smooth texture A little goes a long way Can be difficult to apply The founder of this brand started by making this formula in her kitchen, but now it's one of the biggest natural deodorant players in the mass market, with a legit cult following (including Dotdash Meredith's President of Entertainment + Beauty & Style Group [Leah Wyar](https://www.byrdie.com/leah-wyar-4778558), who's a fan). That's largely due to the non-greasy, non-sticky texture, not to mention the unique scents. There are over 20 different ones, all of which smell great but are never cloying and are completely unisex, ideal if you and your guy like to share. It's not the smoothest of deodorants to apply, but it's worth it for the staying power. Price at time of publish: $11 Type: Solid stick | Active Ingredients: Arrowroot powder, baking soda, coconut oil | Size: 3.3 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Budget Arm & Hammer Essentials Solid Deodorant Effective formula Doesn't leave a white cast Neutral scent Can be a little drying A box of Arm & Hammer is one of the most inexpensive ways to freshen up your fridge, and it turns out the brand has your underarm needs covered, too. You get not one, but two, sticks for less than the price of your morning latte, not to mention excellent wetness absorption and a nice option of scents to choose from. But don't take our word for it alone-there are pages of five-star reviews on Amazon about this deodorant, especially from those who experience excess sweating. Some complain about it being a little drying, though. Price at time of publish: $10 Type: Solid stick | Active Ingredients: Baking soda, coriander fruit oil | Size: 2.5 oz. | Cruelty-Free: No Best With Baking Soda Humble All Natural Vegan Aluminum Free Deodorant Stick Inexpensive Great selection of scents Packaging is made from recycled plastic Won't irritate sensitive skin Can temporarily stain the skin Baking soda can sometimes get a bad rap in the natural deodorant world, and admittedly yes, it can be an irritating ingredient for some. That being said, it's also one of the best odor- (and wetness-) absorbing options out there, so if your skin can tolerate it, go for it. Here, it's in a formula that uses only three other ingredients\u2014cornstarch, fractionated coconut oil, and beeswax. It's one of Duranski's top picks, and she also raves about the affordable price point. Some reviewers do warn that it can temporarily stain the skin, so apply it with care if you're wearing something revealing. Price at time of publish: $14 Type: Solid stick | Active Ingredients: Coconut oil, baking soda | Size:2.5 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Variety Each & Every Aluminum Free Deodorant Great selection of scents Eco-conscious packaging Simple ingredient list Can leave a residue on clothes Variety is the spice of life, which is why we appreciate that this brand offers nine different scents in a range of ultra-sophisticated pairings - think juniper and mint and cannabis, and green tea. But the choices don't stop there. You can also choose between sets of three full-size or four- or eight-count minis and buy just once or sign up for an easy subscription model. Plus, the formula is so clean that it's even verified by the [Environmental Working Group](https://www.ewg.org/) (EWG), an organization that monitors ingredient safety. Like many natural deodorants, though, it can leave a bit of a residue. Price at time of publish: $17 Type: Balm | Active Ingredients: Magnesium carbonate, lavender oil | Size: 2.5 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Paste Routine Natural Deodorant Stays fresh all day Great selection of scents Cream goes on smoothly Can be messy Paste deodorants are polarizing\u2014think of them as the cilantro of the natural beauty world. (A weird analogy, we know, but just go with it.) If you can get behind the application process, which requires a scoop and a smear, pick up this guy. Both experts we spoke to are big fans. \"It's chock-full of moisture-absorbing ingredients, such as kaolin clay, arrowroot powder, magnesium, and baking soda to keep you dry, plus activated charcoal to remove impurities, says Koko. Duranski loves it, too, lauding it for its \"supreme odor protection.\" You might have to practice your application technique, though, as it can be a little messy-especially if you're new to using paste deodorants. Price at time of publish: $24 Type: Paste | Active Ingredients: Seed butter, shea butter, coconut oil | Size: 2 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Fair Trade Alaffia Coconut Reishi Deodorant Inexpensive Nourishing formula Great scent Could be longer lasting It's good to know that your deodorant doesn't contain any harmful ingredients, but you can have even more peace of mind with Alaffia, knowing that it is composed completely of traditional authentic West African fair trade ingredients. It is handcrafted with virgin coconut oil, charcoal, and reishi mushroom extract to soothe, purify, and neutralize odors while keeping you dry and fresh throughout the day. Admittedly, it's not the most long-lasting of the deodorants we tried, so you may need to re-apply to stay fresh until bedtime. Price at time of publish: $7 Type: Solid stick | Active Ingredients: Coconut extract, Saccharomyces ferment, sodium chloride | Size: 2.7 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Scent, Runner-Up Crystal Cucumber + Mint Magnesium Enriched Deodorant Feels cooling and soothing on skin Won't irritate sensitive skin Glides on easily Can temporarily stain skin From the brand that invented the OG crystal deodorant, this hydrating deodorant stick is infused with magnesium to keep body odor at bay alongside an ultra-hydrating base of coconut oil, cocoa seed butter, and shea butter to keep your pits soft and smooth. The real winner here, however, is the scent: The cucumber and mint fragrance is so refreshing, plus it's naturally derived using essential oils and extracts, so you can feel good about what you're putting on your skin. The brand also offers a few other unisex scents, such as sea salt and sage, charcoal and tea, and lavender and rosemary. If we're being super picky, it can leave a temporary stain on the skin, depending on how much you apply.

Within one day of application this product kept me feeling dry and smell-free through a sweaty workout and humid commute on the NYC subway.\" \u2014Dwyer Frame, VP of Commerce Best Refillable Wild Deodorant Good range of fragrances Good value and long lasting Baking soda-free range Swapping refill can be a bit clunky British natural deodorant brand Wild is vegan, environmentally friendly, and slightly addictive. The idea is that you buy a starter bundle comprising a metal case and deodorant refill in a scent of your choosing. You can either buy the deodorant refill as a one-off or sign up for a subscription where you'll be sent a bundle of three at a frequency that suits you. (If you're using it every day, every 12-14 weeks is advised). If you have particularly sensitive armpits try Wild's baking soda-free range that we can report is effective but gentle-in fact, one of our editors hasn't looked back since discovering it five years ago.

Within one day of application this product kept me feeling dry and smell-free through a sweaty workout and humid commute on the NYC subway.\" \u2014 [Dwyer Frame](https://www.byrdie.com/dwyer-frame-5186647), VP of Commerce Like any major change, there's going to be a transition period when moving from an antiperspirant to natural deodorant; experts refer to this as a [detox period](https://www.byrdie.com/natural-deodorant-that-works). \"As your body starts to flush out the barrier that was built-up from traditional antiperspirants, you may notice more sweat and odor,\" says Koko. Duranski notes that this can last up to four weeks. But it will get better so ride it out, and then start testing different formulas, until you find the one that works best with your body chemistry, advises Koko. Final Verdict [Kopari's Aluminium-Free Deodorant](https://www.amazon.com/Kopari-Aluminum-Free-Deodorant-Non-Toxic-Paraben/dp/B07B8B1XJX?tag=byrdie-onsite-backup-20) is a Byrdie favorite thanks to its coconut oil formula that makes applying it a breeze. It also kept us feeling fresh all day. Arm & Hammer Essentials Solid Deodorant is a great no-frills option, especially if you perspire quite a lot and need some reliable protection to get you through the day. N\u00e9cessaire's gel deodorant also gets a special mention for its incredible fragrance that feels like a real treat.

What to Look for in a Natural Deodorant A Scent You Love You probably wear deodorant every day, so a scent you love is essential. From cool and refreshing scents to florals and even unscented options, there is a nice variety to choose from, even from the natural set. Some natural deodorants on this list have up to 20 scents to choose from, making finding one that speaks to you a given. Ingredients Since natural options do not contain aluminum, often the active ingredient is baking soda, which does a good job at absorbing sweat and odor but can irritate some skin types. If your skin is on the sensitive side or you tend to react to products, you might want to steer clear and look for options that contain other odor fighters, like charcoal or tapioca starch. Some options are unscented, so you don't have to worry about fragrance as a potential irritant. And others contain moisturizing ingredients like coconut oil, so you get skin-smoothing benefits as well. And some [deodorants have brightening ingredients](https://www.byrdie.com/best-brightening-deodorants-7480792) to lighten or even under-arm skin. Type of Product A stick isn't your only option to degrease pits. On this list, you'll find sticks and balms but also a paste. Consider whether you travel frequently or want to toss your deodorant in your gym or work bag. Pastes can be fun to use but are definitely messier than the traditional stick you can swipe on and go. And aside from what form it comes in, deodorants sometimes come in different strength varieties. One product on this list comes in sensitive to extra strength. - Does natural deodorant really work? Yes\u2014but there may be an adjustment period, as Koko and Duranski note. Once your body has detoxed from traditional antiperspirant, you should experience odor protection from your natural deodorant. However, because it doesn't contain aluminum as an antiperspirant, you may still experience wetness. - How long does it take to adjust to natural deodorant? Experts agree it can take up to four weeks, or 30 days, to flush out the ingredients in your traditional antiperspirant. There is an adjustment period for your body to adjust to the switch and for the natural deodorant to effectively block odors. - Do I need to detox my armpits before using a natural deodorant? Some people swear by it. It's generally thought that aluminum is absorbed into the skin, though in very low amounts. Popular armpit detox recipes include exfoliating with a [scrub](https://www.byrdie.com/best-body-scrubs-4159724)and then applying a mixture of ingredients such as apple cider vinegar and witch hazel to cleanse the armpits. - What happens to the body when you start using natural deodorant? Traditional deodorants use ingredients such as aluminium to stop sweat, so when you switch to a more natural alternative you may find it takes a bit of time for your body to detox from what you've been blocking. As such, expect some initial itching and possibly even a rash, in addition to slight body odor. For some people this lasts just a couple of weeks, while for others it may be slightly longer.
