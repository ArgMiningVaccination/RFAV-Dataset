Methods Matched, retrospective, cohort studies were conducted to investigate differences in incidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the national cohort of persons who had a primary omicron infection, but different vaccination histories. History of primary-series (two-dose) vaccination was compared to that of no vaccination, history of booster (three-dose) vaccination was compared to that of two-dose vaccination, and history of booster vaccination was compared to that of no vaccination. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Results The adjusted hazard ratio comparing incidence of reinfection in the two-dose cohort to that in the unvaccinated cohort was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.38-0.48). The adjusted hazard ratio comparing incidence of reinfection in the three-dose cohort to that in the two-dose cohort was 1.38 (95% CI: 1.16-1.65). The adjusted hazard ratio comparing incidence of reinfection in the three-dose cohort to that in the unvaccinated cohort was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.44-0.63). All adjusted hazard ratios appeared stable over 6 months of follow-up. Divergence in cumulative incidence curves in all comparisons increased markedly when incidence was dominated by BA.4/BA.5 and BA.2.75*. No reinfection in any cohort progressed to severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19. Conclusions History of primary-series vaccination enhanced immune protection against omicron reinfection, but history of booster vaccination compromised protection against omicron reinfection. These findings do not undermine the short-term public health utility of booster vaccination. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement The authors are grateful for institutional salary support from the Biomedical Research Program and the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Biomathematics Research Core, both at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, as well as for institutional salary support provided by the Ministry of Public Health, Hamad Medical Corporation, and Sidra Medicine.
