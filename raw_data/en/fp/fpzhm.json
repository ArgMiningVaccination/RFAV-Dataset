After we discuss your goals and what you would like to lose then we will take you to the therapy room and do a 30 minute detox treatment where we put your feet in a warm foot bath and safely pull metals and toxins out of your body through the pores of your feet with a probe that is hooked up to the detox machine. You do not feel any pain or discomfort during the detox treatment. During the 30 minutes while you are doing the detox we explain to you how to take our 3 products for a month supply and discuss the meal plan we would like for you to follow. Please, call 214-623-0505 for pricing and setting up an appointment. "}
