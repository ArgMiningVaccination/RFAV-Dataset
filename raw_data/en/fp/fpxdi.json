They stand for Certified Chiropractic Wellness Practioner. Today, I want to explain a little bit about what that actually means and why anyone should actually care. This is an extensive post-graduate diplomat degree that I received after 2 years of graduate work from the International Chiropractic Society. It is basically for chiropractors who want to not only perform chiropractic adjustments for their patients but also teach, educate and change their patient's lives through functional medicine. Functional medicine is a relatively new concept still, but is gaining a lot of traction as the general public is sick of feeling sick and tired all the time. They understand the detrimental side effects of different prescription drugs, surgery and the overall lifestyle they are living. In a nutshell, they are ready for a change. Functional medicine is that change. It gets to the root cause of why and how you are feeling the way you are feeling. If you are willing to make the changes and follow the advice of your functional medicine practioner, you can feel and look better than you have in years in no time. Since functional medicine is still fairly new to a lot of people I just wanted to give people a quick blog post on the concept of functional medicine and what it is. Hope you enjoy. FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE IS: PARTICIPATORY - Patients are expected to be accountable for the lifestyle changes they are going to make. Patients are empowered and educated to make the best decisions for them. PATIENT CENTERED - As a functional medicine doctor, we treat the patient not the symptom or condition. We get your body in a place where it can heal itself without the use of medicine and surgery. SAFE - Functional medicine is very, very safe for the patient with virtually no side effects unlike prescription drugs and modern medicine. HOLISTIC - We treat the body as a whole organism that works together instead of looking at individual parts and systems. We understand each organ and system in the body works together to help you function and heal properly. PREVENTATIVE - Not only do we want to get you feeling better initially, we want to work with long term to keep you healthy throughout every stage of life. SCIENTIFIC - Everything we do and suggest has been backed by medical research and even documented in medical journals. As the general population becomes more and more educated on where true health comes from, functional medicine as opposed to traditional medicine will be the wave of the future in healthcare. Make sure your doctor or chiropractor is trained in functional medicine, vitamins and supplements, lifestyle changes, a healthy stress response, detoxification protocols, proper diet and exercise and even healthy sleep. This is the key that will solve our nation's health care issues.
