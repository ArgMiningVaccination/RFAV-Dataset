By Andrew J. Brown In August, as summer winds down, it's a good time for you and your family to make plans to get the flu vaccine. The vaccine usually becomes available in mid- to late-August. Getting the vaccine early can help prevent you and your family members from getting the flu throughout all of flu season. You can learn more about the flu and flu vaccine at Flu.gov. McDonald Army Health Centers' Deputy Commander for Clinical Services Lt. Col. Karla Davis says \"Immunization is considered one of the greatest public health achievements in the last century. Immunizations are one of the best things you can do to promote your health of your family, and health within the greater community\" When taking yourself and your family for your flu shots, you can also ask your health care provider about other routinely recommended vaccines you might need. There are many routinely recommended vaccines for people of all ages. These are some examples of vaccines you can discuss with your healthcare provider. Make sure that you and your family are up-to-date on all recommended vaccines. Vaccines are the best defense we have against these and other serious diseases, and it's important to make sure that you're up to date on all recommended vaccines. Use National Immunization Awareness Month as your chance to make sure that all your vaccinations are current. Talk with your healthcare provider about what vaccines you and your family need, and keep putting your healthiest foot forward! Protect Your Baby From the Start! Pregnancy is the perfect time to plan for a baby's immunizations, and to make sure that parents have the vaccines they need. Protecting parents protects babies during the first months of life. In addition to the vaccines recommended for all healthy adults, pregnant women need to have an influenza vaccine \"flu shot\" every year and the Tetanus-Diphtheria-acelluar Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during every pregnancy to protect against whooping cough. Other caregivers should also have an annual influenza immunization, and should have a Tdap vaccine, but do not need a Tdap vaccine with each pregnancy. Back to School! Preparing for school is a perfect time to make sure children are up to date on their immunizations. Immunizing a child is one of the most important things parents can do to protect their child's health. Unvaccinated children are at increased risk for disease and can spread disease to others, including babies who are not yet old enough to be vaccinated and people with weakened immune systems. Schools are susceptible to outbreaks of infectious diseases because school-age children can transmit illnesses to one another as a result of poor hand hygiene and dense populations. Many parents are familiar with vaccines that their school-aged children received in early childhood (Tetanus, Diphtheria, acellular Pertussis, Varicella, MMR, and Polio), but are less familiar with the Human Papilloma Virus vaccine. HPV is an abbreviation for human papillomavirus. The HPV vaccine protects against diseases caused by HPV. About 79 million people in the United States are infected with HPV. Most of these patients are in their teens and early 20s. The HPV vaccine works best when it is given to boys and girls prior to any exposure to HPV. For more information about HPV and the HPV vaccine parents can visit the following site: www.cdc.gov/hpv. Young Adults: Preparing for College and Career! Vaccines are not just for children. Immunizations are needed throughout adult life to stay healthy. Immunity from childhood vaccinations may wear off over time; and adults may also be at risk for additional vaccine-preventable diseases. Preparing for College or your Career includes making sure you are up to date on all doses of the recommended vaccines-both to protect yourself and others. Many Colleges and Universities (and the military) have vaccination requirements for entry. Adults: Vaccines Protect Your Health! All adults should get immunizations to protect their health. Immunization is especially important for adults over 60 years, and for people with chronic conditions such as asthma, COPD, diabetes, and heart disease. All adults should get an influenza vaccine each year to protect against seasonal influenza. "}
