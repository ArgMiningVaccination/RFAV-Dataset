Pfizer Family Health Laboratory | p cp || p grad | | Ibuprofen || 100 mg || 7.5 mg | | Sucrose || + || 187 mg | | sorbitol || + | This is drug ( [NSAID] ). It combats pain and lowers the fever. Its anti-inflammatory properties manifest in high doses. It is used in children in the short-term treatment of fever and pain (headaches, dental pain, body aches ...). This medication should not be used in the following cases: Prolonged treatment or [overdosage] of [NSAIDs may result] in serious adverse reactions. The use of NSAIDs is not recommended in children with varicella: it may increase the risk of infectious, exceptional but potentially serious complications. Precautions are necessary in case of [gastritis] , [history] of stomach [ulcer] or oral suspension contains [sugar] (sucrose) and sorbitol in significant quantities. This medication may interact with other medicines, including: Inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking a [diuretic] [beta-blocker,] or a medicine containing ciclosporin. Although this medicine is for the child, its use, as for all NSAIDs, is contraindicated during the last 4 months of pregnancy (apart from very specific medical situations) and advised against during the first 5 months. The oral suspension is suitable for children from 3 months to 12 years (about 30 kg). The vial should be shaken before use. The syringe attached to the bottle allows for an accurate [dosage] adjustment: the dosage per dose is indicated, depending on the weight of the child. 3 or 4 doses per day are required. The tablets are suitable for children from 20 to 30 kg (approximately 6 to 12 years). They should be swallowed as they are with a large glass of water. Catches must be spaced at least 6 hours apart. Usual dosage: - Child: 20 to 30 mg per kg per day, divided into 3 or 4 doses, not to exceed 30 mg per kg per day, ie: - child under 20 kg: 1 filled syringe up to the graduation indicating the weight of the child, 3 or 4 times a day; - child 20 to 30 kg: 1 or 2 syringes filled to obtain the total weight of the child, 3 or 4 times a day or 2 tablets, 3 times a day. In the absence of medical advice, the duration of treatment should be limited to 5 days in case of pain and 3 days in case of fever. Have the child drink a little water after taking the oral suspension to avoid tingling in the mouth and throat. Do not exceed the [dosage] or duration of treatment prescribed by your doctor, in order to limit the undesirable effects. Nausea, vomiting, [gastritis] . Rarely: - stomach or [duodenal] [ulcer] , [haemorrhage] of the digestive tract (bloody vomiting, black stools, or mostly imperceptible blood loss, responsible for the progressive onset of [anemia] ) most often during long-term treatment duration or high [dizziness] , headache; - , sugars (sorbitol, maltitol ...), possibility of [diarrhea] in case of important contribution. [NSAIDs ] Abbreviation for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Family of anti-inflammatory drugs that are not derived from cortisone (steroids), and the best known of which is aspirin. [allergy ] Skin reaction (itching, pimples, swelling) or general discomfort occurring after contact with a particular substance, use of a medication, or ingestion of food. The main forms of allergy are eczema, urticaria, asthma, angioedema and allergic shock (anaphylactic shock). Food allergy can also result in digestive disorders. [anemia ] Reduction in the level of hemoglobin in the blood, which usually results in a decrease in the number of red blood cells. Iron is essential for the synthesis of hemoglobin. Iron deficiency during pregnancy, a vegetarian diet, abundant or repeated haemorrhage (menstruation) is a common cause of anemia. Other causes, more rare, are related to vitamin deficiencies of group B. [antecedent ] Affection healed or always in evolution. The antecedent may be personal or family. The background is the history of a person's health. [antiplatelet agents ] Medication that prevents the platelets from clumping and therefore the clots from forming. The oldest platelet antiaggregant is aspirin taken in small doses. Anti-aggregants should not be confused with anticoagulants with a different mechanism of action. [anti coagulants ] Medication that prevents blood from coagulating and therefore prevents clots from forming in the blood vessels. Anticoagulants are used to treat or prevent phlebitis, pulmonary embolism, certain infarcts. They also prevent the formation of clots in the heart during rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation or in the case of an artificial heart valve. There are two main types of anticoagulants: - oral anticoagulants, which block the action of vitamin K (antivitamin K, or AVK) and whose effectiveness is controlled by a blood test: INR (formerly TP); - injectable anticoagulants derived from heparin, the efficacy of which can be controlled by the blood assay of anti-Xa activity, Howell's Time (TH) or Cephalin Kaolin Time (TCK) depending on the products used. A regular dosage of blood platelets is necessary throughout the life of a heparin derivative. [anti-inflammatory ] Medicine that fights against inflammation. It can be either derived from cortisone (steroidal anti-inflammatory), or not derived from cortisone (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory or NSAID). [asthma ] Disease characterized by difficulty breathing, often resulting in wheezing. Asthma, permanent or occurring by crisis, is due to a narrowing and inflammation of the bronchi. [beta blockers ] Family of drugs used primarily in cardiology. They block the action of adrenaline (and other related hormones) on the heart, vessels and bronchi. [diarrhea ] The strict medical sense of diarrhea is \"emission of stools too frequent and too abundant\". In fact, common sense equates diarrhea with the notion of fluid and frequent stools. Normally, stools are pasty, but the emission of liquid or barely formed stools, without pain or particular associated disorder, is not pathological. Diarrhea can occur when liquid stool emissions are repeated during the day and the needs are overwhelming or painful. Many medicines can accelerate intestinal transit and make the stools more liquid, without this undesirable effect being of real concern. Antibiotics can alter the digestive flora, essential for digestion, and cause more or less troublesome but benign diarrhea. The effect appears immediately or after a few days of treatment. A severe and exceptional form of diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, can be observed after antibiotic treatment; this condition results in the emission of mucus and false membranes (resembling skin flaps) associated with abdominal pain; constipation may replace the initial diarrhea. Pseudomembranous colitis can occur several days after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment and requires urgent medical advice. [diuretic ] Medication allowing increased kidney water removal. Most often, this loss of water follows the loss of salts caused by the drug (salidiuretic). Diuretics are mainly used in the treatment of high blood pressure, while their mechanism of action in this disease is poorly understood. They are also prescribed in acute or chronic heart failure, edema and other rarer ailments. These drugs cause loss of sodium and potassium (except for some of them called \"potassium-sparing\"). Their prolonged administration therefore requires regular blood potassium control, to avoid heart problems that may result from hypokalemia (lack of potassium in the blood). Lack of sodium is another possible but less frequent consequence of the prolonged use of diuretics; it is also detected by a blood test. [duodenum ] A part of the intestine into which food from the stomach penetrates. [skin rash ] Appearance of pimples or plaques on the skin. These lesions can be due to a food, a drug, and translate an allergy or a toxic effect. Many viruses can also cause pimple eruptions: rubella, roseola and measles are the most common. [gastritis ] Inflammation of the stomach favored by stress, tobacco, alcohol and certain drugs such as aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs. [hemorrhage ] Loss of blood from an artery or vein. Hemorrhage can be external, but also internal and go unnoticed. [angiotensin II inhibitor ] These drugs are sometimes called sartans, for the names of the molecules belonging to this family end with sartan (losartan, candesartan, etc.). This family of drugs blocks the action of angiotensin II, a substance that increases blood pressure and tires the heart. Angiotensin II inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure. [ACE inhibitor ] This family of drugs blocks the action of an enzyme, which converts angiotensin I (naturally inactive substance) to angiotensin II. This last substance increases blood pressure and fatigue the heart. ACE inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure or myocardial infarction. [heart failure ] Inability of the heart to fulfill its function as a pump. The main symptoms of heart failure are fatigue and shortness of breath during an effort. [Hepatic insufficiency ] Inability of the liver to perform its function, which is essentially the elimination of some waste, but also the synthesis of many biological substances essential to the body: albumin, cholesterol and coagulation factors (vitamin K, etc.). [kidney ] Inability of the kidneys to eliminate waste or medicinal substances. Advanced renal insufficiency does not necessarily result in a decrease in the amount of urine excreted. Only a blood test and creatinine dosage may reveal this disease. [lupus erythematosus ] Skin disease causing redness of the central part of the face. There are two main forms: discoid lupus (only cutaneous) and disseminated lupus (associated with lesions of the deep organs). [blood count ] The count measures the number of red blood cells (red blood cells), white blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets in the blood. The blood formula specifies the percentage of different white water or lymph causing localized swelling. [dosage ] Quantity and distribution of the dose of a drug according to the age, weight and general condition of the patient. [allergic reaction ] Reaction due to hypersensitivity of the organism to a drug. Allergic reactions can take a wide variety of aspects: urticaria, angioedema, eczema, eruption of pimples resembling measles, etc. Anaphylactic shock is a generalized allergic reaction that causes discomfort due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. [sugar ] General term for various substances of which the most widely used is sucrose. Other sugars can be contained in drugs: glucose, fructose, lactose, etc. Glucose is the sugar used by the body; it is the only one to circulate in considerable quantity in the blood. Sweeteners (false sugar) are allowed in diabetics or people on a diet, and are very low in calories. [overdose ] Excessive intake of a drug may result in an increase in the intensity of adverse effects or even in the development of specific adverse effects. This overdose may result from accidental or voluntary poisoning for suicide, so consult your local Poison Control Center (listed in the appendix to the book). However, in most cases, overdose is the result of an error in the understanding of the prescription, or the search for an increase in efficacy by exceeding the recommended dosage. Finally, untimely self-medication may lead to excessive absorption of the same substance contained in different drugs. Some drugs are particularly prone to this risk because they are (wrongly) considered to be harmless: vitamins A and D, aspirin, etc. Stopping or decreasing drug intake helps to remove the disorders associated with an overdose. [transaminases ] Enzymes dosed in the blood, which rate rises during some hepatitis. They are included in blood tests as SGOT and SGPT or ASAT and ALAT. [ulcer ] Injury of skin, mucous membranes or cornea. - Leg ulcer: chronic wound due to poor circulation of blood. - Gastroduodenal ulcer: a localized wound in the mucosa of the stomach or duodenum due to excess acidity and very often to the presence of a bacterium (Helicobacter pylori). The ulcer is favored by stress, alcohol, smoking and certain medications (aspirin, NSAIDs, etc.). [dizziness ] Symptom that can mean an impression of loss of balance (common sense) or, more strictly, a sense of rotation on oneself or the environment (medical sense).

Health Education Council: \"WHAT TO DO IN THE EVENT OF FEVER\": The normal temperature of the body is variable from one individual to another and between 36.5 \u00b0 C and 37.5 \u00b0 C. An increase of more than 0.8 \u00b0 C is considered a fever. In infants (under 2 years of age): o Fever can be dangerous: it entails a risk of convulsion if it rises too much and above all too quickly, it causes a risk of dehydration. o What has to be done: undressing the child (a naked child in a room at 20 \u00b0 C risks nothing), often drinking (some children drink very little but very often), possibly, bathe it in water whose temperature is 2 \u00b0 C below that of the child, have the person take a fever medication, after ensuring that the medication is appropriate to the infant's weight, in accordance with the indicated doses. o What you should not do: cover the child, increasing the risk of convulsion and dehydration, put it \"on the diet\". o Consult a physician: In the following hours, if the temperature is raised to more than 38.5 \u00b0 C and accompanied by other abnormalities: unusual behavior (screams, crying, drowsiness), vomiting, diarrhea. In children over 2 years: If the disorder is too troublesome, you can give a fever medication, after making sure that the medication is appropriate to the child's weight, according to the doses indicated. However: if there are other signs (such as a rash), or if the temperature persists for more than 3 days or if it gets worse, see a doctor if headache becomes violent, in case of vomiting, consult a doctor immediately. \"WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF PAIN\": Consult a physician: \u00b7 In the absence of improvement after 5 days of treatment, \u00b7 If the pain returns regularly, \u00b7 If they are accompanied by fever, \u00b7 If they awaken your child at night, "}
