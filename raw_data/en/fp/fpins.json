Ayurveda treats the whole mind-body complex. Read on to learn how you can improve your wellbeing. Grief, loneliness, [anxiety,](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/blog/feeling-insecure-you-can-use-these-6-anxiety-tips-for-your-fears) depression, insomnia, substance abuse, and [suicidal thoughts](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/blog/world-suicide-prevention-global-panel-discusses-the-need-of-the-times). All these are either a result of severe stressors or in themselves can cause severe stress. The [Covid-19 pandemic](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771763) has increased [stress levels](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2020/10/stress-mental-health-crisis) greatly. A June [CDC survey](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/13/health/mental-health-coronavirus-pandemic-cdc-study-wellness/index.html) found that a staggering 41% of US respondents reported at least one mental or behavioral health condition during the pandemic. Those with increased risk to mental health challenges include caregivers, essential workers, the [young](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-10-stress-america-survey-reveals-mental.html), elderly, minorities, people with pre-existing health conditions, and those with [multiple hardships](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200902182417.htm). This winter brings added worries about flu season, [allergies](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/blog/can-ayurveda-help-with-autumn-allergies-say-bye-bye-to-your-sniffles), and a third (?) wave. [Quarantine fatigue](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/blog/quarantine-fatigue-is-real-these-6-ways-can-help-you-cope-with-it), loneliness, and Seasonal Affective Disorder ( [SAD](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/feeling-sad-5-natural-remedies-for-seasonal-affective-disorder)) further compromise our mental wellbeing. What mental health suggestions does the 5,000-year-old Science of Ayurveda offer? How Ayurveda Views Mental Health Ayurveda defines health as a balance of energy principles ( [Doshas](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/balancing-your-health-and-dosha-types)) and a pleasant state of mind. It is holistic and acknowledges the mind-body-spirit connection. Every Ayurvedic intake includes an assessment of psychological factors, lifestyle, and current stressors. Mental imbalances (Manovikara) are cared for as part of the disease process and aren't stigmatized. Our Ayurvedic constitution is composed of three Doshas and their imbalances cause diseases. [Vata](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/how-to-balance-vata-dosha-9-tips-for-balancing-your-body-and-mind) imbalance typically causes anxiety and phobias, [Pitta](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/7-tips-for-balance-and-health-of-the-pitta-dosha), anger, and obsessions, and [Kapha](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/understanding-kapha-dosha-a-few-tips-to-balance-your-body-and-mind) could cause depression. Likewise, we all go through phases of feeling uplifted, restless, or lethargic. These are attributes of the mind (Gunas). Sattva is the natural state of the mind that we try to attain for optimal mental health. It is light, productive, and balanced. Rajas is ambitious and restless and Tamas is lethargic and dull. While we need Rajas and Tamas to work or rest, their imbalance can cause anger or depression. Mental health imbalances are also caused by genetic and external factors, the effect of time, a misuse of our senses or knowingly doing something that harms the health like overeating or engaging in a violent argument! Raising Prana (vital life force) and awareness through practices like meditation helps us to make better lifestyle choices. Ayurvedic Mental Health Management Let's consider simplified examples, Case 1: Elliot is 15, with an anxiety diagnosis, fear of the dark, disturbed sleep, traveling aches and pains, and allergies. Based on a comprehensive assessment, his case is managed through classical Vata balancing. Case 2: Astha is a 27-year-old techie with anger issues that have cost her a job. She is ambitious, intellectual, restless, and overindulges in spicy food, drinking, and late nights despite suffering from hyperacidity. In her case, we try to manage Pitta imbalance and reduce Rajas by raising Sattva. Case 3: Sue is 49 with Type II bipolar disorder. She is very stable but has menopausal mood swings. We make sure she stays on her medication. In a standard assessment, we find issues with [Agni,](https://artoflivingretreatcenter.org/blog/understanding-the-agni-principle/) Vata-Pitta imbalance, a tendency to burn out, and attend to impacted channels in an integrative approach. Classical disease management in psychiatric ailments (Unmada) includes Spiritual Therapy (chants, [mantras](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-forward/201906/mantra-powerful-way-improve-your-well-being), and gem therapy), Psycho-behavioral, and Biological Therapies with Palliation (through herbs, [nutrition](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/how-the-ayurvedic-diet-transforms-your-body), lifestyle changes) and [cleansing](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/this-ayurveda-fall-cleanse-will-get-your-body-in-shape-for-the-season).
