Hans van Florenstein Mulder, New Zealand Now that the first three years of my function as Representative of the General Anthroposophical Society in Asia have come to an end and I am about to start on the next three years, I would like to give an overview of what has happened in these years and what the direction for the next three years hopefully might be. It all started when the General Secretaries of Australia, America, Canada and New Zealand discussed how they could focus more on the area round the Pacific and Asia. After having found many emerging initiatives out of the work of Rudolf Steiner in this region, it was decided to hold an anthroposophical conference with the representatives of these initiatives in Manila in 1996. The next year this conference was held in Mumbai and a Waldorf Round Table conference for teachers was added. Each year the number of people attending the conference grew . Conferences were held in Thailand, Taiwan, Japan for an ever-growing number of participants. Smaller conferences based on Waldorf education were held in Hyderabad and Bangkok. These conferences metamorphosed into the first Waldorf teachers conference in Asia in Taiwan, 2005, and 2007 in Thailand, to serve as an ongoing professional development for teachers in the Asia-Pacific region. At the last conference in the Philippines, 2009, 300 teachers attended. The next conference is planned for Hyderabad in 2011. So along side the anthroposophical 2conferences, held every two years, there is now--at the same time- -the Waldorf teacher's conference, also held every two years. The growing number of the teachers participating and people attending the anthroposophical conferences is a reflection of the very rapid growth of initiatives arising out of the work of Dr. Steiner. The first activity was seen in the field of education. In various countries the schools have grown into institutions including high schools (India, Manila, Thailand, Taiwan and South Korea). Many teachers from other countries, including New Zealand, have given their support to the teachers of these emerging schools. Then came the interest to know more about anthroposopi- cal medicine and the International Postgraduate Medical Train-ing (I.P .M.T.) to help doctors gain insight into anthroposophical medicine began. Led by Dr. Michaela Gloeckler, these I.P .M.T. conferences were held in the Philippines, India and Japan and will start in Taiwan in 2010. The interest in education and health came together in a number of Kolisko conferences all over the Asia-Pacific region. Kolisko conferences will be held in Hawai'i and New Zealand this year. The next question came in the field of agriculture and horti- culture. The interest in the biodynamic method of growing food has grown rapidly, particularly in India. After some years of giv-ing introductory seminars in biodynamic agriculture, a three-year course in biodynamics in Taiwan for the Mandarin speaking world has now started. Participants come not only from Taiwan but also from Mainland China, Malaysia and Hong Kong. A similar seminar is planned to start in Mindanao, the Philippines, for the coming year. So we see a healthy development in the initiatives in many areas. Inroads are also being made with a renewal of the arts through anthroposophy: eurythmy, music, painting, sculpture and art therapy are taking root and trainings are gradually being established. And what of the interest in anthroposophy itself? The Execu- tive in Dornach created the position of General Secretary for Asia, so that it would be possible to further the understanding of anthro-posophy and facilitate the activity of the School of Spiritual Science. Over the last years the wish to know more about Anthroposophy has grown rapidly in many Asian countries. There are now countries where the number of members of the Anthroposophical Society is such that we are looking at the next step: How do we shape the structure of the Anthroposophical Society in these countries. To come to forming a picture how this can be done in the right and appropriate way, national conferences in Taiwan, Thailand and Nepal will be held in this coming year. All this activity was made possible for the last three years through funds made available to me by the Anthroposophical Society in Hol-land. For the next three years the funds will come from the German Anthroposophical Society, the Friends of Waldorf Education, the Italian Anthroposophical Society, the Anthroposophical Society in Hawai'i, the Australian Anthroposophical Society, and the New Zealand Anthroposophical Society. I would like to express my deep gratitude to all who have made or will make my work and the work of anthroposophy in Asia possible. Updates on this work will be shared through Pacifica Journal, national Society newsletters, and Anthroposophy Worldwide.International Kolisko Conference in Hawai'i--2010 Van James, Honolulu, Hawai'i Hawai'i has an exceptionally healing environment due to its northern Pacific light, sub-tropic warmth, fresh sea air, salty ocean waters, pure artesian drinking water and rich, fertile volcanic soil. The vital life forces of the islands are abundantly supportive and sustaining, providing energetic, good health. In fact, Honolulu is reputed to be America's healthiest city. The state government even encourages alternative medicine and natural health practices. Yet, there are no medical doctors in Hawai'i working out of anthroposophically extended medicine. There are three Waldorf schools in the Hawaiian archi- pelago, and several charter and home-school initiatives inspired by Steiner education. For a state population of 1.3 million that is more Waldorf schools per capita than any other state in the union. And yet the medical equivalent of Waldorf education, Anthroposophic medicine, is not established by the practice of one single doctor. This is one of the important reasons why an International Kolisko Conference in Hawai'i was so important. Although natural, traditional, eastern and various other kinds of alter-native healing, not to mention allopathic medicine, are well assimilated throughout the islands, Anthroposophic medicine only just received its first real spotlight for five days in early 2010, with a gathering of 200 people from the local community together with folks from all over the world. Eugen Kolisko, an Austrian medical doctor, worked closely with Rudolf Steiner to be the first school physician at Michaela Glockler gave the keynote addresses at the 2010 Kolisko Conference in Hawai'i.3the original Waldorf school in Stuttgart, Germany. He spe-cialized in preventa-tive medicine with an eye for both the spiritual and physi-cal development of the child and consulted regularly with teachers, even attending the fac-ulty meetings. Ko-lisko conferences, established in his memory in order to continue this work, bring together teachers, health practitioners and doctors to share concerns, research, and insights from the perspectives of each. Dr. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler, champion of Kolisko Conferences around the world and leader of the Medical Section at the Goetheanum in Switzerland, was the keynote speaker at this conference on \"Reading the Needs of Children and Under-standing the Stages of Human Development--Birth to Age 21.\" Workshop leaders from Hawai'i, the US mainland, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe joined participants from as far as India, Singapore, Japan, Columbia and South Africa. Everyone gathered at the Honolulu Waldorf High School's new oceanfront campus and were welcomed by traditional Hawaiian chant, music and hula performance while partaking of a luau (traditional feast), the first of several exceptional Pacific fusion meals. Each morning Ronald Koetzsch delivered announcements with a humorous slant, followed by Hawaiian singing led by Jocelyn Romero Demirbag. The conference leading thought, an aphorism by Rudolf Steiner, prepared the way for the morning lecture:\"Once in olden times there lived powerfully in the souls of the initiates the thought that by nature every person was ill and education was seen as a healing process that brought to the child as it matured health for becoming a true human being.\" Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler then described in her morning lectures how the latest research in neuroscience confirms much of what Steiner indicated at the beginning of the twentieth century about child development and early learning. This confirmation research has recognized, for example, such realities as emo-tional intelligence, the importance of relationships and love in education. For research suggests that even genetic substance is changed by means of the \"I\" activated feeling life. Smiles from a mother for her child and an engaged emotional life in old age can positively alter brain functions and behavior. From vari-ous perspectives, Michaela, pointed out how the teacher must become a healer and how the doctor must become a teacher. If one learns what one needs at the appropriate time then illness will not occur, and 75% of all illness is preventable. Each day the insights and wisdom inherent in the human being were described and delineated. A clear construction of the \"piano\" or instrument into which the child incarnates was articulated, year-by-year. For instance, year one: body control, standing, walking; year two: communication, speech; year three: inner space, thinking \"I am I;\" and so on, up to age 21. The depth and breadth of material brought by Michaela, the warmth of personal examples, touched everyone in the audience--doctors, therapists, teachers and parents. Some of the workshop themes included: The Study of Man and the Teachers` Meditations as a Source of Healing in Education; Understanding Development as the Basis for Helping the Child; Working with the Four Sheathes; Elements of Effective Discipline for Young Children Today; Sex Edu-cation in Waldorf Schools, Grades 4-12; The Waldorf Class-room as Therapeuticum: How does the Waldorf Curriculum Address the different Learning Styles of Our Students?; Pre-conception, Gestation & Birth. Artistic workshops included eurythmy, painting, form drawing, pastel drawing, geometric drawing, speech, and stone carving. The days were full and 4even included excursions to local Hawaiian attractions. In this unique place on earth where six times the number of people who live here pass through each year, a kind of circula- tory system is created by means of the tourist trade. Hawai'i is like a heart in the mid-Pacific, pulsing with the influx and outflow of people, products, and services. If Waldorf educa-tion is to flourish within this dynamic organism into the future, it will need the benefits of an approach to healing that arises out of an understanding of the human being. What Eugen Kolisko strove to establish in the early twentieth century in Europe, the Kolisko Conference in Hawai'i strove to kindle in the early twenty-first century in the central Pacific. May this impulse increase a thousand-fold! Color at the Honolulu Waldorf High School Van James, Honolulu, Hawai'i In old Hawai'i, when a rainbow appeared in the sky, the people declared that a divine presence was near and that it was a sign of \"heavenly footsteps\" coming to light on the earth. Many cultures, including the Judeo-Christian tradition, see the naturally occurring spectrum of colors as a \"token of the cov-enant between God and man,\" between the spiritual and the physical. Clearly, color is a bridge between our inner soul life and the outer physical world, for we say we are \"feeling blue,\" \"seeing red,\" behaving cowardly black mood,\" or \"in the Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Waldorf education, said: \"Color is the soul of nature ... and when we experience color we participate in this soul.\" Color is the emotional life of the natural world and if we can get beyond just looking at it as though it were mere gradations of gray to truly experience the wonderful visual sensations we call color we would then be intimately engaged with this living being, long referred to as Mother Nature, and more recently as Gaia\u2014the living planet and the cosmos. If we look into a Waldorf school classroom we see the de- liberate and consciously considered use of color. Although not every Waldorf school is exactly the same in its choice of colors there is often a general consistency based on a response to the stages of child development and room function. For instance, in the nursery, kindergarten, and early grades, a soft, warm, pink tone is usually selected for walls and curtains because of its gently active and supportive quality. Pink is a loving, inno-cent color, decidedly feminine in character. Therefore, it is a natural color choice for the daily embracing of this age group. The Waldorf classroom colors evolve from this warm, dissolved reddish tone in the early grades, through energetic orange-yellow around third grade, into the middle spec-trum greens about fourth and fif th grade. It is here at the half- way-point of childhood that a kind of balance is achieved just at the onset of puberty. Green is the balanced color between light and darkness, and meets this age group in a wonderfully harmonizing way. From sixth grade on into the high school, various shades of blue domi- Workshops at the Hawai'i Kolisko Conference included eurythmy.

However, craft rooms are often appropriately painted with warm colors, and spaces for eating are aided by appetite sympathetic golden-orange tones. The interior colors in a Wal-dorf school are meant to support the child's general phase of development at the same time as to enhance the educational experience for the particular grade level. Each classroom is a unique space for a speci fic age group and its activities. Therefore, each classroom wears a color appropriate to that space, the age of the students, and what generally takes place in it. If one looks around at most state and other independent schools there is often a one-color- fit s-all scheme, generally utilizing shades of institutional green. This is simply not the case in a Waldorf school. Another important aspect to the color environment in a Waldorf school is the transparency of color. The color treatment, called lazure, is not a standard industrial, fla t paint but a medium and technique that involves several watercolor-like applications veiled over each other to create rather subtle hue variations as well as a translucent effect. The reason for this is that with a lazured room, one does not experience the boundary of the wall as abruptly as with the fla t painted surface. It is as though one can \"breathe\" beyond the sur-face of the wall and not feel as constrained or bound by the room's walls. Waldorf schools, hospitals and clinics, retirement homes and therapeutic communi-ties, restaurants and shops, as well as private residences have used this lazure technique for its bene fic ial quality of making one feel less trapped indoors and giving one a sense of soul space. Here the \"soul of Nature\" can be more readily experienced, even if unconsciously. Steiner said that transparent color benefits the further evolution of humanity, whereas opaque color treatments do not. Plantcolors, as opposed to mineral and synthetic colors are yet another benefit. External building colors can vary greatly from school to school and from geographic setting and cultural environment. Building colors also change with fashion or with what commercial paint manu-facturers are selectively promoting at any given time. But over and above this the colors for the new Honolulu Waldorf High School were selected with the following consid-erations in mind: a building for adolescents to learn and live in, the surrounding natural environment, and a unique aesthetic contribution to the local community. The oceanside campus site in East Honolulu has been renovated and upgraded to serve as the new home for the Honolulu Waldorf School's upper classes. Its exterior is painted in a peach color with accents in a contrast-ing ultramarine blue. Peach is a warm, nurturing, heart-felt color, inviting and accepting. It is a similar hue to that of the lower school buildings in Niu Valley and is a healthy, natural tone. Second floor courtyard of the Honolulu Waldorf High School oceanfront campus.

It is similar to the color that every newborn child reveals on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet, no matter what their race. The dark blue trim is almost an exact complementary color to the lighter peach tone. It is a cool, reserved tone that expresses thoughtful-ness, deliberation, introspection, and even devotion. It is a color that harkens to the sea and the sky. Although these two colors are strong in contrast, striking and bold, their combination is warm and welcoming, yet alert and wakeful. These are colors we trust will serve the high school students so they can meet their community and protect their environment with strength of heart, intelligence, and courage for the future. Local and Universal Festivals: What is Appropriate in Asian Waldorf Schools? Yoshiko Koketsu, Kyotanabe, Japan I have been researching the festivals of Waldorf schools and at the last two Asian Waldorf Teachers Conferences, in Taiwan and Thailand, I interviewed numerous teachers from different schools. Here are some of the results and I hope it will be of help in considering what are the appropriate festivals for us in Asian Waldorf Schools. Festivals in the Waldorf Schools Festivals have a very important role in Waldorf schools. The annual rhythm calls for our seasonal awareness and makes us feel something spiritual beyond our daily lives. Not only the children but also adults get the seeds of renewal through pre-paring and joining in the festivals. In the first Waldorf School in Europe there were four major celebrations: Easter in spring, St. John's in summer, Michaelmas in fall, and Advent in winter. These are also celebrated in other parts of the world where the religious and climatic conditions are similar. (These four festivals are referred to below as the original Waldorf festivals). Questions Arising with the Spread of Steiner Education These festivals are appropriate for the schools in the temperate zone and in Christian countries. But since 1919 almost 90 years have passed and Waldorf education has spread worldwide, and there are questions with regard to the trans-planting of Waldorf practices. For example how do we think Jake and Bella Tan, of the Philippines, give a seminar on early childhood in the Handwork Room of the Honolulu Waldorf High School. Two exterior murals at the Honolulu Waldorf School were painted by 12th grade students as part of an independent art project.7about certain festivals in the southern hemisphere and in non- Christian or mixed-culture countries? Each school also must work with its own regional festivals and celebrations. These questions play into the character of the Waldorf Curriculum. Some fundamental questions relating to the curriculum are as follows: ~How much of the Waldorf curriculum is universally applicable and how much can and should be adapted to local cultural circumstances? ~How much of the Waldorf Curriculum is essentially fo- cused on supporting actual child development and how much is there for external cultural reasons? ~What minimum constitutes the Waldorf Curriculum? What is the bottom line, below which a curriculum cannot in all honesty be considered Waldorf? ~In what specific or general, long or short-term ways, do the subjects and experiences of the curriculum actually sup-port the child's development and how can this be observed and evaluated? These questions can be translated into questions about festivals: ~How much of the Waldorf school festival content is universally applicable? ~How much can and should be adapted to local cultural circumstances? ~What minimum constitutes the Waldorf Festivals? What is the bottom line, below which a festival cannot be considered Waldorf? ~What do the children get through the experiences of each festival? Researching Festivals in Asian Waldorf Schools Interviews were carried out and questionnaires were circu- lated between 2005 and 2007 at Waldorf teachers' conferences, and information from 18 schools in 13 countries was collected. Three types of celebrations were recognized: A) Celebrating local festivals B) Celebrating mainly original Waldorf festivals C) Celebrating both local and original Waldorf fes- tivals together These three types clearly show the questions about festi- vals in Asian Waldorf schools: to do festivals based on local, original Waldorf as universal, or to create a balance of both. Some Thoughts About Celebrating Festivals in Japanese Schools The following observations were gathered from four Japanese Waldorf teachers from different schools in Japan: Asian festivals, like this one at Sloka Waldorf School in Hyderbad, India, can be very colorful and action-filled.8a) It is important for us to celebrate the four original Waldorf festivals, even if we do so only on a small scale. We think these festivals touch the universal human soul. We are not dogmatic about these festivals, neither do we wish to easily change them. b) W e have discussed the question of the festivals since we started our school, amongst both teachers and parents. Before each festival we discuss the nature of the festival. What is the meaning of this festival? Is it OK to do it the same way as the year before? Can we change it in such in such a way? We always try to create the festival anew each time. c) It is important to have reverence for the sacred, but we do not teach any religion. We try to find the universal mean-ing in the festivals based on Christianity or on old Japanese tradition. We try to find the essence of the festival. We have researched and embedded the essence of each festival in Japanese culture. We celebrate each festival from the view point of Steiner, thinking about the connection between the human spirit and the natural world at the foundation of the festival, and it may be a good chance to think about festivals for our children's families. As the above responses demonstrate, there is a clear striving to find an appropriate form and means of celebrating festivals in Japanese Waldorf schools. Ryuhan Nishikawa, who is deeply involved in both Anthro- posophy and Buddhism, said, \"When we try to adopt Steiner education and plant it in Japan, we best try to do it through us-ing the old wisdom that we have cultivated in Japanese culture, and not trying to rearrange the foreign culture according to our own. We need to examine which part is essential and universal and which part is the Germanic tradition in what we call Waldorf education.\"(Nishikawa 2007) In other words, it is im- portant to examine what the essential, universal parts of Waldorf festivals are, and what the European, Judeo-Christian traditions are. When we look for the essential, universal aspect in a festival we do not change its character to suit local conditions but try to find this aspect in the old local wisdom. This means, we do not avoid the celebration of original Waldorf festivals be-cause they are Christian festivals, nor do we automatically do the original Waldorf festivals just because they are done elsewhere, but because they are universal we can search out a third pos-sibility in our own locality and let it bloom. In the multi-cultural setting of North America schools have already taken this direction. One example is expressed by Nancy Foster, who has taught at Acorn Hill Waldorf Kindergarten in the United States for over thirty years. She says: At our kindergarten our stated intention is to observe the Christian seasonal festivals in a way that speaks to the universal in the human being. We feel that \"universal\" doesn't mean to include everything , but reaching deeply to find the essence of the human experience in the cycle of the year. This striving is a process. We hope to create a mood of reverence, which can then be carried into each family's particular celebrations, whatever their religion or culture. (Nancy Foster 2004) Some Further Thoughts In Asian countries there are various climates. Within these different climates particular festivals are celebrated. Most Asian countries are non-Christian and culturally very differ-ent, even from each other. This requires great sensitivity and consideration when adopting festivals, particularly the original Waldorf festivals. Here are some keys from Martyn Rawson on this subject: What is actually needed is time for a curriculum to evolve out of the local culture. These questions are already being worked on to some extent but need to find a broader basis within the work of schools and teacher training. 1. We need documentation of good practice in Waldorf education in different countries. 2. We need to collect and review narrative content, stories, Music, speech, dance, drama, visual and performing arts are usually the vehicle for any festival.9 Crop Circle beside ancient megalithic monument in southern England.fables, legends and myths that are typically told to certain age groups in different countries. Comparison would show what they had in common. 3. To find the balance between the culture that arises out of the spirit of the place and that which arises out of the spirit of the time is a challenge for every Waldorf school, no matter where it is. 4. Research is needed into ways in which the teaching ap- proach and different activities within the curriculum actually work on the children's development. 5. Research is needed into the techniques and methods of individual child study. 6. We need to find better ways of bringing all these research questions into school based study in ways which enhance the on-going process of educational development. (Martyn Rawson, 2001) There are many ways to think about and create festivals in Asian schools. Let us try to collect the information of the various celebrations of each school, to think about the essence of these festivals or what the educational meaning of it is for our children. We Asian teachers always need to think about each festival and examine the essence of it in order that we may find out the educational meaning of it. Our viewpoints are often inconsistent, so we need to consciously pursue our task to unlock the essence and purpose of festivals in Asia today. I would very much appreciate that you share new informa- tion with me concerning your school festivals. Please contact me with any insights you may have on this theme of local and universal festival celebration in the Asian Waldorf schools.

The word geomancy comes from the Greek \"geo\" standing for earth and \"manteia\" meaning divination. It could be translated as earth divination. Indeed, geomancy is a very old divination method. From here we got two different interpretation of the word. On one hand, we got geomancy as one of the most powerful divination art. An art use to read you future through the casting of stones or sols in the air and the studying of the way they would fall on the ground. As they fall the element could take 16 different shape. Each of them would be drawn by 4 doted line, even or uneven. On the other hand, as the word geomancy remained, the practice changed. Nowadays, geomancy is better known as a way to found and harmonize earth inner energy. According to Marko Pogacnik, Earth is a living soul which has its own feelings and thoughts. Our planet is made of many elements such as water, air, plants, stones... Its the earth itself which has place them on its surface and those elements balance each other. When human being built something, say motorways, artificial lack, rail... this balance is broken and the place is upset. Those upset places release negative energies called geopathicstress zone. And if a living beings stays to long in a geopathicstress place it can af-fect its health, causing diseases, sleeping disorders etc... This is where geomancy comes in, as it will be use to heal the earth and through this, heal the living beings living in the upset area. 10We precising that we have focus our work on the second \"meaning\" of geomancy. The word geobiology comes form \"geo\" meaning earth and \"bio\" standing for life. Geobiology is known as the study of the effect of environment on the human beings. Richard Benishai, is a member of the dowser's European association ( we will talk more about Mr Benishai in the second part) He is specialised in geophysics and telecommuni- cation. As for Mr Benishai, geomancy could be seen as the ancient term for geobiology. Both of those terms represent more or less the same practice though geobiology seems to comprehend more than geomancy. Mr Benishai explains that when geomancy is focused on the earth healing process, geo-biology focuses on the healing process of human through the healing of the earth. Moreover, Geobiology pay attention to the inner earth negative energy as well as the negative energy surrounding us on the surface of the earth. Those energies usually comes from mobile phones, TV , Internet... The aim of the geobiologue is to found the geopathicstress point and rebalance the energies in order to get back in a balance positive energy. Mr Benishai explain that it is scientificly prooves that negatives energies affect the electrimagnetic field of our cells, that it devitalize our body while weak-ening our immune system. According to Dr Hartmann, \" diseases appears according to the place we live in\". So before healing the body you need to heal the place. Feng Shui stands for Wind and Water. It is the Chi- nese practice of geomancy and exist for about 6000 years. It's known in occident for only around 20 years. Since then, it has became really famous all around the world. The aim of Feng Shui is the \"well being\" of human. It could be define as a \"habitat acupuncture\". Its practice is really close to geobiology. Along as seeking for the geopathicstressed zones feng shui has principles of it's own. Fen Shui is based on the fact that the universe as whole is made of 5 major elements : Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood. Those 5 elements are bound to each other. (Source : http://www.add-fengshui.com/feng- shui/feng-shui-principes.htm ) An other important principle of Feng Shui is the Ying and Yang. Those two forces complement each other as each of them got its own action. Ying is associate to the moon and the feminine side of nature while yang repre-sent the sun and the masculine side of nature. None can be without the other, they complement each other and balance the energies of the planet. If their is too much of this force it destroy the other one. Fen Shui is about balancing and harmonizing the Ying and Yang. A lot of people use fen shui to build or arrange their home in order to improve their lives. In order to practice geomancy many different tools are needed. As our work is based on Marko Pogacnik work we are going to present and explain the tools he uses. But let's start with a fundamental step that is needed in geomancy, geobiology and Fen Shui. The basis of any work remotely related to geomancy is Dowsing. Dowsing is fundamental as it is use to identify earth energy. Mostly known as a way to found underground water stream dowsing can help you found an object or a person. It is the energy broadcast by an element that is felt by the dowser. Once you found, say, the negative energy of a place (a geopathicstress point) you can found out about how to rebalance the flow into a positive energy. Dowsing use rods, wood wands or pendulums as tools to connect with the earth energy. But some really sensitive pesos don't even need tools o feel the energy and some others can even found energy from a distance. Also when seeking for the spot it is important to stay highly focus on the object of the research. We can speak about \"defocusing\" meaning that your mind is set on only one very thought. In order to rebalance an upset place you can use many means such as Lithoponcture also known as earth Cosmogram on lithopuncture stone by Marko Pogagnik.11acupuncture. This method involves the positioning of stand- ing stones on the geopathicstress points. If the place does not permit us to place a standing stone then you can place a bronze pavement or wooden poles. For those stones and bronze pave-ment to have an impact on the earth cosmogams are carved in their surfaces. As for the poles, it is the poles themselves who are placed so as to shape the cosmogram. Cosmograms are drawings that are made to communicate with the consciousness of the earth and to give a piece of the spirituality of the place to the stone. Also a cosmogram has got a spirit of its own and it has a relatively autonomous activity within a given environment. You can also encounter zoograms, which are cosmograms shaping an animal. Those drawings bring with them the soul and energy of the animal it represents. A visualization work can be use to calm down a place for a while. For visualization work only last till the end of the exercise. Visualization is based on imagination. You have to visual- ize the way of healing the place that is upset. For instance, a lighted tube around a motorway. Along with this visualization work you can do holographic exercises which are movement that give more energy and bring a rhythm to the visualization. You can also sing or talk in the same rhythm. Finally, we can add labyrinths. Even if they are more about a meditation work and a spiritual journey, they are an interesting tool for people who wants to calm down and get to focus on their inner feel- ings. It's also a way to workout you right brain: all your emo-tions and imagination. Places, Events, personality evolved in geomancy and different points of view.

For miles I have ridden and never alone.Two companions go with me;each bring me grief. At m y left hand rides one who mocks the world's wonders;at my right, dark-shrouded,the nameless shadow. I was charged to be strong; I was charged to be wise.But dark is my conscience,leaden-weighted.Wherever I wanderI see death and forgetfulness.And in me as well the shadow sits. Shall I write of redemption? Shall I write of love?What can I sayin my sinful state?The shadow beside me,stern Fate, the spoiler,lies waiting at all times -a snake in the grass. (ii) Salt While still in the High LandsI was charged to be poet.They said, \"Have no fearand follow your heart!\"But all has been marredby meddlers, mischief-makers.See how I blame themwhen I know it's myself! What shall we do with salt that's lost flavour?Useless, good onlyto be trampled underfoot.And the horses' hoovesare hammering upon me,and the wheels of the wagonsroll me in the dust. And I have to get up as if nothing has happenedwith pain in my conscienceand pain in my limbs.Now no more poemson the death of love.We will stand again, sing again,greater than before! Ah, but where is the singleness of clear vision?Nothing is so neededby the children of earth!The one on my leftgives a shrug of his shoulders;the face of the otheris dark as the night. (iii) Bread and wine F ew there be who know Love's largesse, who remember the mysteryof bread and wine.I, who have satat the King's marriage feast,now spend my time beggingbeyond His gates. My thirst was insatiable; my hunger gnawed me.And I took the things 13that I could get. They were not bread;they were not wine.They were simply the thingsthat I could get. I still had the longing but I lost discernment.I both forgotand did not forget.The victim of everycrooked salesman -how many there must be,just like myself! Salvation to the earth shall be through beauty.For this to take placeshe must be discerned.Every advertisementshows only her double.Every base in the mistthe reddening dawn.See in the dewdrop,entire, the world.In the heart is a placewhere Nature speaks softly.If this has been lostyou must find it again. (iv) On the day I set forth... My uncle the baker and my uncle the wine-maker -both gave their blessingson the day I set forth.I rode all that night;I crossed the dark river.I handed my feeto the one on the shore. And I drank the draught of deep forgetfulness.For only socan we bear to be here.But slowly the memoriesof my homeland awaken;slowly my mindand my heart become one. Riding, riding,w eary and wounded - never weakening,ever strong.I cannot keep doing this -but I keep doing this.All you can dois do what you must. And closer I come to the place that awaits me.I share sweet bread.I drink new wine.My bones are oldbut my heart is lightening.A time will comewhen it will know peace. And these companions of mine are grafted to me.I do not fightagainst them now.In fact I am learningto work alongside them,for each of themis a piece of myself.Yes, each of them -a piece of myself! (v) T he future What will happenwhen the oil runs outand the scale of the bank fraudat last is revealed?What will happenwhen the winds of heavenblow down the towerswe've so proudly up-reared? Some say salvation is from flying saucers.Some say salvationdoes not exist.I say it is wewho create all that happens.May more of us wakento sail God's ship. And whatever will happen, this soul will be faithful.There will be much woebut it won't be the end.We endure, we grow,we become creators.To our hands is chargedthe healing of earth. 14NEWS Nicanor Perlas Runs for Philippines Presidency Cultural and social activitist, hands-on threefolding expert, former biodynamic farmer, anthroposophist and winner of the \"Right Livelihood\" award Nicanor Perlas has announced himself as a candidate for president of the Philippines, the East Asian republic formerly colonized by Spain, and, from 1899 to 1946, by the United States. A nation of 90 million people living on three island groups, with millions more overseas, the Philippine people have been known for a special spirituality, but their society has been plagued in recent decades by politi-cal cronyism. Exiled to the USA under the Marcos dictatorship, Perlas has worked with the Rudolf Steiner Institute, Think OutWord, and many other groups around the world. He is known for his insightful activism, and during the 1990s he led the successful effort to have a threefold or tri-sectoral view of society embedded in the Philippine national plan for the 21st century. In recent years he has worked on the regional level in the Philippines encouraging partnerships of activists, business people and government officials, and most recently he has turned attention to the renewal of cultural and spiritual values in the Philippines. In announcing his candidacy he took note of the need for non-traditional candidates to enter the political arena and bring with them the best standards of the whole society and a commitment to real change. His campaign website includes a video speaking to youth about creating peace.
