For example, 50 per cent of social security expenditure is spent on those aged 65 or over 1, and some 40 per cent of NHS expenditure2. Although it is hard to generalise, many older people have contact with public services because they: !tend to have greater need for them than younger people (for example, healthand social care); !tend to have less money than other age groups; !experience significant life changes (for example, retirement or bereavementof a spouse); !may be offered services, for example, preventative 75 year health checks; and !have more time available than other age groups, offering the chance, forexample, to use libraries or community facilities. 2 Traditionally, public services have been provided face-to-face (for example, in a local office), by correspondence, or by home visit. Information on governmentservices has been supplied in leaflets (available, for example, in Post Offices) oradvertising in national or local papers. More recently, the public sector hassought to develop new options, recognising that no single means will satisfyevery circumstance. This has led to the creation of, for example: !one-stop-shops, where visitors can receive advice in one place on a widerange of different services provided, for example, by a local authority; !the establishment of call centres such as NHS Direct; and !services tailored for those who do not speak English. For instance, theDepartment for Work and Pensions' Pensions Direct call centre has accessto interpreters who can speak in a variety of languages. 3 In addition, Government has increasingly looked to offer electronic services (e-services) to widen choice further. Most public organisations now havewebsites. A small number of departments and local authorities are pilotingdigital television and electronic information kiosks. And there are initiatives toincrease use of e-services via public facilities and by providing cheaper internetaccess from home. These run parallel with developments in the private sector.Many banks allow customers to transact electronically, and retailers havecreated websites so customers can order from home. 1 National Statistics, Social Trends UK (2001). 2 Department of Health, National Service Framework for Older People (2001). summary and recommendations2summary and recommendationsPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Examples of common services used by older people1 Source: NAO!Medical check up at 75 !Hospital and GP !Flu vaccinations !Dental and optical checks !Nursing homes and Security Housing Benefit!Sheltered housing !Home care Housing !Winter Fuel Payments at 60 !Pensions and Minimum Income Guarantee !Information on coping financially with bereavement!Housing benefit !Residential care !Disablement benefit !Carers benefits!Renew driving licence and timetable information for public transport !Mobility bus !Free transport schemes Travel3summary and recommendationsPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 4 Previous NAO reports3have examined the management of websites and call centres in order to meet the target that all government services are availableelectronically by the end of 2005. This report examines progress towardsanother Government objective - that of ensuring that everyone who wants itcan access e-services by the same deadline. It focuses on older people, who todate have been low users of such facilities, and looks in particular at: !what government has done to extend opportunities for older people toaccess a range of electronic media (Part 2); and !what departments and a range of other bodies are doing to ensuregovernment e-services are accessible to older people (Part 3). As well as older people, the messages are also relevant to other groups of citizens, such as those of all ages with disabilities or those on low incomes. E-services potentially offer older people a range of valuable services 5 It is not realistic to expect everyone to use new technology. In particular, many older people do not see the internet as relevant to them, and prefer traditionalchannels of contact. However, certain characteristics of many older peoplesuggest innovative e-services could benefit them if developed and marketedappropriately. In particular, many: !are less mobile due to illness or disability: call centres and interactive services allow people to handle their affairs without having to travel. Forexample, the Pensions Direct call centre has ensured many unnecessaryvisits to benefit offices are avoided; !need information on a wide range of issues but are unsure how to find it:internet portals and electronic kiosks could enable older people to gaininformation on health, consumer rights and benefits from a single source,saving them time and inconvenience; !live alone or are far from relatives: some 60 per cent of women and one third of men over 75 live alone. E-mail would keep them in touch withfriends and family easily; !wish to maintain their independence: technology exists for people to consult doctors and monitor their health using telephone and video links,so avoiding the need to move into a home; and !wish to be involved and consulted on issues relevant to them: in 2002 an online consultation (Seniorspeak) was organised by the Hansard Society toconvey the views of older people, their families and carers to politicians inthe Westminster and Edinburgh Parliaments on the subject of long term careand health. 3 Government on the Web II (HC764, Session 2001-02), Better Public Services through e-Government (HC704-1, Session 2001-02), Call centres (HC134, Session 2002-03).4summary and recommendationsPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE The Government aims for everyone who wants it to have access to the internet but must beproactive to overcome barriers to take up 6 The Government expects to invest some \u00a36 billion in e-services by March 2006 to achieve the Prime Minister's goals that all government services are availableelectronically and that everyone who wants it has access to the internet, bothby the end of 2005. The latter target assumes that some will use e-services athome, and others in public places such as libraries. It also acknowledges thatsome may not want access. Meeting this target is not an end in itself, but wouldhelp achieve other government objectives such as avoiding social exclusion,encouraging lifelong learning and promoting equity in service provision. 7 To optimise the return on the investment and to secure value for money, the Government needs as many people as possible to utilise e-services. The numberof households with access to the internet trebled between 1999 and 2002, andby October 2002, some 28.6 million adults in Great Britain had used itsomewhere 4. However, use varies significantly according to characteristics such as age, income and location. These variations are often referred to as the'digital divide', with age perhaps the most pronounced. While 94 per cent of16-24 year olds have accessed the internet, only 47 per cent of those between55 and 64 and 17 per cent of those over 65 have. The main barriers thatdiscourage usage by older people are summarised in Figure 2 . Barriers that discourage older people from using electronic services2 !Physiological effects of ageing, including loss of dexterity or diminution of vision or hearing. !Lack of confidence or familiarity with new technologies, resulting in lack ofawareness of potential. !Cost, or concern about anticipated cost, especially for people in low-incomehouseholds. !Style and language used which can be a deterrent if, for example, it is overlyformal or technical. !Lack of knowledge and skills leading to some reluctance to seek assistance toaccess online services. !Belief that e-services are of no relevance to them. !Inconvenient or inappropriate locations putting off potential users because ofdiscomfort using such services in public or fear of being unable to deal withproblems at home. !Inaccessible web designs that cannot be read by the access technology that peoplewith disabilities rely on. 4 National Statistics Omnibus Survey (October 2002).5summary and recommendationsPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 8 A 'digital divide' could undermine progress towards widespread use of government e-services, but there are some grounds for optimism that age willbecome less of a barrier. The 55-64 age cohort makes significantly greater useof the internet than those over 65 5. Many retiring now have used computers at work, although those who did not work in an office remain unlikely to havemuch IT experience 6. There is also evidence of an unwillingness to accept that new technology is only for the young7, although health factors - such as poor manual dexterity - are likely to persist as a barrier. This may place a natural limiton take-up, although even this may be more about perceptions, since technicalsolutions to help those, for example, with poor sight are available. 9 Previous NAO reports on e-services (Better Public Services through e-Government (HC 704 Session 2001-02) and e-Revenue (HC 492 Session2001-02)) highlighted the potential savings for Government fromdevelopment of e-services. In addition, there could be significant benefits toindividuals from well designed e-services, but only if they are convinced oftheir value. Given current low levels of take-up among older people, findingincentives is particularly important with this group. There are some limited signs that older people are taking advantage of government initiatives toincrease access to e-services 10 The Government has developed a number of initiatives to provide access from public places and from home, and to provide and encourage training. TheDepartment for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture, Mediaand Sport have jointly established a network of UK online centres , for which older people not engaged in learning are a key target group. The Prime Ministerannounced that the target of 6,000 centres by the end of 2002 had been met ahead of schedule in November 2002. Sustainability is an issue for somecentres, and progress in setting them up in deprived areas was slower thanplanned (750 by August 2002 compared with 2,000 planned). However, 2,840 such centres had been opened by the end of 2002. The Department forEducation and Skills have also launched a Wireless Outreach Network whichprovides laptop training facilities for adult learning and community centres. 11 Many users have been pleased with their experience of the UK online centres. To date, some centres have found it more difficult than expected to attract olderpeople and the disadvantaged, but early management returns from centreslocated in deprived areas show that 70 per cent of clients are from the targetgroups. An evaluation found that around 80 per cent of users already haveaccess to the internet elsewhere 8, although the New Opportunities Fund consider it is not unusual at an early stage of a funding programme for the mostdisadvantaged groups to remain wary of computer training opportunities. 5 National Statistics Omnibus Survey (October 2002). 6 Participants in our focus groups who did not use computers regularly said that their previous and current employment did not require them to use IT. 7 For example, our focus groups found that older people generally had positive feelings about using computers. 8 Hall Aitken, UK online centres (CMF funded) - initial report (September 2002).6summary and recommendationsPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 12 Many centres have done good work in drawing in new users, but others could be more proactive. An online marketing toolkit and dedicated centres supportwebsite have been set up to assist centres. Poorer performing centres will beoffered support to increase quality, but where not considered compliant withgrant contracts, funds will be reclaimed and the grant terminated. To date,information on attendance levels and the quality of centres is limited, andarrangements are only now being introduced to monitor them. Without closerattention to the profile of users there is a risk that resources will not be spenton target groups. It is also important that centres are equipped appropriately tomeet the requirements of people with physical disabilities such as blindnessand partial sight. Centres should be able to provide learners with disabilitieswith appropriate support. 13 Information kiosks have been installed in public places such as shopping centres and hospitals, offering information through a touch-screen facility. TheDepartment of Health have installed 180 kiosks, providing advice on medicalconditions and healthy living, but it is unclear whether funding will continue.An initial evaluation found that, although 42 per cent of people in thesurrounding area had visited the location, of these, just 7 per cent had used the kiosk 9. In 2001 and 2002 a separate pilot scheme installed kiosks in 212 Post Offices in Leicestershire and Rutland. These offered a broader service,providing advice and, in some cases, the opportunity to interact withorganisations such as the Department for Work and Pensions, the InlandRevenue, local authorities, voluntary bodies and commercial bodies. Althoughpopular, in October 2002 ministers decided not to take forward a publiclyfunded service on the grounds that it would neither significantly improvegovernment departments' ability to meet their objectives nor generate a viablelevel of income for Post Office Limited and its branches. However, there iscommercial interest in placing kiosks in Post Offices and a service is likely tobe piloted in Cornwall in 2003. 14 The Government has sought to encourage wider home access, but this has raised some legal and practical issues. The Department for Education and Skillsdistributed 24,000 refurbished computers to disadvantaged groups in 2000-01, including older people, at a cost of \u00a37.1 million (\u00a3296 per machine). Thesecosts reflect delivery, installation, maintenance, software, a printer and an operating system. The project encountered problems in sourcing anddistribution, as well as legal problems, and there are currently no plans tocontinue. However, most participants were satisfied with their computer.Another scheme - Wired Up Communities - which has so far connected 9,000 homes and other locations to the internet, experienced similar problems. 15 The Government sees digital television as an additional platform for delivering services to citizens. In May 2002, MORI estimated that 43 per cent of viewershad access to digital television 10, and a significant number are older people. The Government will maintain existing analogue services until everyone who currently receives public service broadcasting channels can receive them digitally and switching over to the digital service is an affordable option.The target timetable for meeting these criteria is 2006-2010. As a measure ofaffordability, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport consider that 95 per cent of consumers should have access to digital equipment beforeanalogue transmissions can be switched off. 9 University of Plymouth, Evaluation of NHS Kiosks (December 2001). 10 MORI, Digital Television 2002 Final Report (May 2002).7summary and recommendationsPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 16 Two departments - the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions - as well as the Office of the e-Envoy are piloting public digitaltelevision services (at a cost of \u00a39 million), and a further 19 departments andagencies plan to do so. The services are at an early stage (Figure 3) . 17 Departments and agencies already rely heavily on call centres (examined in the NAO report Using call centres to deliver public services HC 134 Session 2002-03) to deliver electronic services and they have been successful in attracting olderpeople. We examined three Department for Work and Pensions centres aimedspecifically at older people. One of them, the Pensions Direct centre, received1.1 million calls in 2001-02, and of the estimated 490,000 people due to retirein 2001-02, 63 per cent chose to complete the retirement pension claim formover the telephone. NHS Direct now have a target to increase awareness andusage among older people from 11 to 20 per cent. 18 The success of all these initiatives will depend on how the benefits are promoted. Departments and agencies spent at least \u00a314 million in 2001-02advertising e-services, but understanding of the UK online brand among older people remains low despite a national campaign in 2001. While nationaladvertising may help to raise awareness, local UK online centres need toencourage older people to use their facilities by demonstrating the potentialbenefits and opportunities for training. A number of public and privateinitiatives offer IT training for older people, but the closure in 2001 of theIndividual Learning Accounts scheme (covered in the NAO report IndividualLearning Accounts HC 1235 Session 2001-02) has closed off one avenue forsupport that had been used by some older people. Digital television services being developed by government departments3 UK online This is the digital television version of the UK online internet portal. The Office of the e-Envoy envisage that the service will provide a single point of access for viewers wanting to obtain information from and interact with government departments. The Pension Information is available on planning Service for retirement, approaching retirement and being in retirement, including private pensions and related services. Interactive features include ordering leaflets, online survey and state pension age calculator. For those who receive State Pension into their bank accounts, there is a 'change of circumstance' reporting facility. NHS Direct Four separate services have been tested, including programmes and videos on healthy living and a television version of the NHS Direct website, offering advice on common medical conditions. 8summary and recommendationsPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 19 Older people are more likely to use government websites if the content is perceived as interesting and relevant to them. The governments of the UnitedStates of America and Canada, for example, have set up 'portals' specifically forolder people. Such an approach provides a focus for marketing of e-services toolder people and allows government to consult with users online and providetailored information and services. There is no general government portal forolder people in the United Kingdom, although The Pension Service website, aswell as providing information on state and private pensions, does provide linksto other services that may be of interest to older people. The Office of the e-Envoy are currently looking at candidates for developing services arounddifferent customer groups, one of which is older people. In addition, the UK online website contains a pensions and retirement information portal. Government is making progress in providing accessible electronic services for older people,but there is room for considerable improvement 20 The impact of the ageing process can prevent older people from accessing e-services. Like other people, older users value interesting and easily foundcontent, and simple navigation. In addition, many with poor vision are lookingfor larger than normal font size. The Office of the e-Envoy expect departmentsand agencies to make their websites accessible and usable by everyone. Theyhave issued guidance on the accessibility of websites that incorporates bestpractice. The Office promote their own website (www .ukonline.go v.uk)as an exemplar, and have begun to review departmental sites and discuss necessaryimprovements. Many public bodies have voluntarily taken steps to enhanceaccessibility, and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 makes it a requirementto provide services for disabled people of the same standard as for other users. 21 The accessibility and usability of government websites is improving, but many of the 65 we examined (considered likely to be of interest to many olderpeople) do not yet meet widely accepted best practice standards. None fullycomplied, and most met between four and six of the 10 criteria we scoredagainst. Performance was best on physical appearance factors, such as clearnavigation and the ability to alter the size of text, but only 25 per cent passedtesting using software that checks automatically whether a website complieswith important elements of accessibility guidance. Very few public bodies hadyet implemented technical guidance from the Office of the e-Envoy on, forexample, standard access keys, or have a PICS rating, which would have abearing on whether people can find and use government websites.Nevertheless, there is evidence that a considerable number of governmentwebsites are now being upgraded to make them more accessible.22 Existing government websites might be more accessible if older people were able to use a third party to act as an intermediary. Such an approach wouldenable the customer to use a suitably qualified person to complete the detailson-line on their behalf. The 'Citizens Connect' project is at the forefront of suchinitiatives and aims to use Citizens Advice Bureaux to provide wider access togovernment e-services. Wider roll out of the \u00a320 million project in early 2004will depend on whether the 2,000 bureaux in England and Wales areconvinced of its benefits and are able to support the training and otherassociated running costs. 23 Delivery of information and interactive services via digital television is still developing, and has considerable potential to provide services for viewers withsensory and physical impairments. The Digital Television Action Plandeveloped by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Departmentfor Culture, Media and Sport, in partnership with public and privatesector stakeholders, includes consideration of the needs of peoplewith disabilities, many of whom are older people. However, the wayin which interactive services are delivered currently via on-screenmenus makes them largely inaccessible to many older peoplewho are blind and partially sighted. 24 Piloting work by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Health of their digital television services hasidentified a range of problems, and is allowing theseDepartments to understand better how they will need todevelop the service. The piloting of informationkiosks has also identified a range of improvements.In neither case have accessibility standards yetbeen developed comparable to those for websites. 9summary and recommendationsPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE10summary and recommendationsPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Recommendations 25 Encouraging greater use of computers and the internet is a major challenge. To try to attract more older people and other low users, we recommend: The Office of the e-Envoy should: (i) clearly define and publicise how they intend to measure progress towards the target of universal access by 2005, and the criteria for assessing whenthe target is achieved, as well as consider setting and monitoring a specifictarget for usage among older people to focus attention on this group(paragraph 1.13); (ii) undertake periodic surveys of the public (of which older people would be a key subset) to ensure that they continue to understand the barriers tousing e-services (which may change as technology and the characteristicsof the population change), and to identify what features and services areattractive to them. Research on client group characteristics should bedisseminated widely to departments and agencies likely to provideservices used by older people to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort(paragraphs1.15-1.18 and paragraph 3.4); (iii) encourage organisations - for example, registered social landlords - in regular contact with hard-to-reach groups, such as older people and thoseon low incomes, to build on existing innovative developments, such as thetraining and facilities provided through the London and QuadrantHousing Trust, to introduce older people to the benefits of new technology(paragraph 2.34, Figure 17); (iv) undertake a targeted marketing campaign with specialist voluntary sector organisations, such as Age Concern and Help the Aged, and in mediamost commonly used by older people, including television, magazinesand local newspapers, to highlight the benefits from using e-services anddraw attention to the main services available electronically, includingNHS Direct, online pensions advice, local government information sites,as well as the availability of training. This should take account of lessonslearned from previous e-services campaigns, and evidence of what kindof marketing works with groups of older people (paragraphs 2.31-2.33); (v) consider the business case for developing an attractive government portal for specific customer groups such as older people, in the light ofexperience elsewhere, as the focus for a marketing campaign aimed atencouraging use of e-services by older people (paragraph 2.38); (vi) encourage departments to explore more vigorously the scope for using intermediaries to deliver services on their behalf, for example,voluntary bodies with existing skills and knowledge of the client group(paragraph 3.18);11 summary and recommendationsPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE (vii) develop the monitoring established in 2002 to examine the accessibility of government e-services and websites against accepted best practice(perhaps by following up and developing the NAO's survey for thisexamination and the work of Age Concern and the RNIB) to ensureminimum standards are achieved and to provide advice where websitesare below standard (paragraph 3.15); (viii) ensure that the requirements of those with disabilities are taken into account in any further development of government digital television andinformation kiosk services (paragraphs 3.21-3.30). The Department for Education and Skills should: (ix) set up quality control arrangements to measure the service provided by UK online centres and take-up amongst hard-to-reach groups, and toarrange periodic unannounced inspections to monitor performance, inorder to allow assessments about which UK online centres shouldcontinue and help ensure resources are used on target groups. (We notethat the Department for Education and Skills are working with UfI to agreequality control and monitoring arrangements when UfI assumesresponsibility for support services for UK online centres in April 2003.(paragraph 2.11)). Local authorities should: (x) monitor the performance of UK online centres in libraries to help ensure that resources are used on target groups (paragraph 2.11). The Department for Education and Skills/Local authorities should: (xi) encourage a more proactive approach towards hard-to-reach groups, to promote awareness and encourage use of UK online centres, based onevidence of what works, for example, visiting older people with lap topcomputers to demonstrate the benefits of computers, as alreadyundertaken, for example, by Age Concern (paragraphs 2.33-2.34). All departments and agencies should: (xii) not develop further major interactive digital television services independently until existing pilots demonstrate a clear business case forthe medium, and should encourage close co-ordination acrossgovernment in order to ensure a common approach to branding, layout,navigation and consideration of the user perspective (paragraph 2.24); (xiii) continue to review their e-services against best practice in terms of accessibility (paragraph 3.8).12part onePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLEPart 1PROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE The use of e-services by older people 13 part one1.1 In 2000, there were some 11 million people of pensionable age in the United Kingdom (18 per cent ofthe population), and the number is expected to grow toapproximately one quarter of the population by 2040 11. Collectively, they are major users of public servicesprovided by both central and local government. Fifty per cent of social security budgets are spent onthose aged 65 or over, while older people consumesome 40 per cent of NHS expenditure 12, and make considerable use of public transport and libraries. 1.2 In recent years, the Government has sought to encourage the use of new technology to help improve the delivery ofpublic services. Previous National Audit Office reports 13 have focused on the development and management ofelectronic services (e-services) in order to meet the targetthat all government services are available electronically by2005. This report looks further at e-services from theperspective of users. In particular, it focuses on olderpeople, who, to date, are one of the groups who haveshown least interest in e-services. As well as the internet,the report examines the creation of a network of UK onlinecentres and information kiosks, and early progress with theintroduction of government services on digital television. Older people are major users of the developing range of public services 1.3 Although older people's needs are varied, certain characteristics mean many come into contact with awide range of public services. In general, they: !tend to experience health problems : for example, in 2000, nearly half those over 75 reported having a longstanding illness that limited their lifestyle 14. Visual impairment, arthritis, and some forms of diabetesbecome more common with age, often requiringregular advice and intervention from medical services; !tend to have lower incomes than other age groups : older people are entitled to a range of benefits, whichmay lead to an increased likelihood of contact withThe Pension Service and local authorities;!experience a number of significant life changes : retirement, moving to sheltered housing, orbereavement all bring contact with public services.For example, bereavement of a spouse may lead tocontact with the NHS, Registrar of Births, Deathsand Marriages, and the Inland Revenue; !become eligible for certain targeted services : for example, many GP practices offer preventative 75 year health checks; and !have more time available than other age groups : after retirement, many people tend to have moreopportunities to engage in educational orvolunteering activities. Government is developing alternative ways for people to access public services 1.4 There are a number of traditional means of accessing public services. For example, information about benefitshas been obtained face-to-face at a local office, or byrequesting a home visit. A considerable number of olderpeople prefer to communicate with public bodies byletter. There are also well established routes for publicservices to offer information to their clients, forexample, by placing information leaflets in post officesand community centres, or advertising in local andnational newspapers. 1.5 In recent years, the public sector has sought to develop new options for interacting with clients, recognising thatno one means will satisfy every circumstance. This hasled, for example, to: !the piloting of one-stop-shops, where visitors canreceive advice on a wide range of different services.Many local authorities have set up high street officeswhich deal with all the services provided throughtheir different departments; 11 Government Actuary's Department, 2000-based Population Projections for the United Kingdom (2002). 12 Department of Health, National Service Framework for Older People (2001).13 Government on the Web II (HC764, Session 2001-02), Better Public Services through e-Government (HC704-1, Session 2001-02).14 National Statistics, Social Trends UK (2001).14part onePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE !the establishment of call centres such as NHS Direct (examined in the NAO report NHS Direct in England(HC 505 Session 2001-02)), which can provideservices accessed from home; and !services for those who do not speak English. Forinstance, the Department for Work and Pensions'Pensions Direct call centre offers access to interpreterswho can speak to callers in a variety of languages. 1.6 Many departments and agencies are now also using electronic means to deliver services. By doing so, theyaim to increase choice for clients, and offer easier touse, better quality and more innovative provision. Tohelp meet the target of making all government servicesavailable electronically by the end of 2005,Government expects to have invested some \u00a36 billion ine-services by March 2006. Central governmentdepartments and agencies have identified 581 potentialservices and, by summer 2002, 304 were availableelectronically. There are also initiatives to increase useof e-services via public internet facilities. 1.7 Much attention has been focused on the use of computers, but e-services may also be provided in otherways - digital television, electronic information kiosksand via telephone (see below). !Digital television : Digital television (DTV) can be received via satellite, cable, terrestrial (via an aerial)or DSL (via the telephone line). Some services onDTV platforms require a subscription, and theplatform operator provides the necessary equipment,such as a set-top decoding box. Some services areavailable on satellite without a subscription, anddigital terrestrial television is all free-to-view.Viewers can use a remote control or keyboard toaccess services such as banking and homeshopping. A small number of departments and localauthorities are piloting the delivery of services viadigital television. !Electronic information kiosks : Electronic kiosks are being placed in public places such as shoppingcentres, GP surgeries and pharmacies. A commonexample is a kiosk providing tourist information.Kiosks tend to employ touch-screen technology toallow users to search for information that is stored inthe memory of the kiosk. It is also possible to equipkiosks with keyboards and connect them to theinternet, so that users can interact with theorganisation that owns the kiosk. !Telephone : Many government departments and agencies operate call centres that allow callers toobtain information, request leaflets, submit claims ormake payments. 1.8 Developments in the public sector mirror those in the private sector. Many banks and insurance companiesnow enable customers to handle their financial affairsvia a call centre or website. Retailers have createdwebsites allowing customers to order goods from homeat times convenient for them. These also offeropportunities for personalising services. For example, aretailer can record the types of goods commonly boughtby a customer, and then offer information on similarproducts. Increasingly, businesses such as banks seedigital television as a new way of providing services. E-services potentially offer older people a range of valuable services 1.9 The Government recognises that not everyone will want to use e-services. By far the most important reasongiven 15for not using the internet is 'lack of interest'. Many do not believe that new technology will make iteasier to deal with government. In September 2002, 73 per cent of adults who had never used the internet(representing around one third of all adults) said theywere very unlikely to do so in the next year 16. 1.10 However, while it is difficult to generalise, there are a number of characteristics of many older people thatmake e-services potentially valuable to them. Forexample, many: !experience mobility and health constraints : although many older people remain healthy, 35 per cent of those between 65 and 74, and 48 per cent of those 75 or more have long-standingillnesses which limit their lifestyle 17. The availability of easier forms of communication could assist thoseunable to leave home; !need information on a wide range of issues but areunsure of how to find it : internet portals and electronic kiosks allow older people to gaininformation on health, consumer rights and benefitsfrom one source, saving time and effort; !wish to maintain their independence : technology already exists for people to consult doctors andmonitor their health using telephone and videolinks, so avoiding the need to move into a home.Social landlords such as the London and QuadrantHousing Association allow tenants to report theneed for repairs electronically, helping them handletheir affairs more efficiently; !want to remain active : few (7.6 per cent of men over 65 and 8.2 per cent of women over 60)18work beyond state retirement age. Many retired people 15 National Statistics Omnibus Survey (October 2002). 16 National Statistics Omnibus Survey (October 2002).17 National Statistics, Social Trends UK (2001).18 National Statistics, Labour Market Trends (July 2001).15 part onePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE turn to hobbies and interests (family history being a particularly popular example) for which computersand the internet have considerable value; !engage in learning activities : in 2001, 22 per cent of people aged 65-74 and 12 per cent aged 75 ormore 19took part in some kind of adult learning, for which the internet can be a valuableinformation resource; and !live alone or away from relatives : the likelihood of living alone increases with age. In 2000 50 per centof those over 75 were living alone 20. Many people have families abroad. E-mail offers the possibility ofeasy contact. 1.11 The Government believes there are strong business reasons for wider use of e-services. The PensionService, for example, aim to conduct much morebusiness in the future via telephone and email. Theircurrent e-business strategy acknowledges they mustaccommodate the needs of all users, and continue tooffer face-to-face contact and home visits if required. Inthe longer term, however, using e-services to deal withlarge numbers of older people for routine contactscould lead to major savings. 1.12 Potential benefits will only be realised if large numbers of people can see value in using e-services. Our report onthe Inland Revenue 21stressed the need to offer additional benefits to persuade potential customers, such as a moreconvenient and easy-to-use service or a cash saving.Given current low levels of take-up among older people(see paragraph 1.16), it is essential that services aredeveloped with content of interest and use to them,which they believe will work effectively. There are wider benefits in ensuring that everyone who wants it canhave access to the internet 1.13 As well as the goal of making all government services available electronically by the end of 2005, the PrimeMinister set the target that everyone who wants it shouldhave access to the internet by the same point. Meetingthis will also contribute to broader Government goalsand key elements of Government policy for olderpeople. For example, it would help to:!promote equity : Government e-services offer the prospect of a faster service, greater convenience, asimplified process, or even a cost saving. Peoplewithout access to e-services may be left with asecond class service or potentially none at all; !avoid discrimination : The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 states that those who provide goods andservices to the public must take reasonablemeasures to ensure they are not discriminatingagainst disabled people. It is against the law to offera disabled person a service inferior to that offered toothers. In the United States of America, legislationspecifically requires federal agencies to ensure thattheir e-services are accessible to all citizens 22; !develop innovative services : e-services provide opportunities to deliver services in new or betterways, for example, by completing forms with dataalready held by government in order to avoidduplication of effort; !involve citizens : In 2002, an online consultation (Seniorspeak) was organised by the Hansard Societyto convey the views of older people, their familiesand carers to the Westminster and EdinburghParliaments on the subject of long-term care andhealth. More than 170 people, including Membersof Parliament, contributed; and !encourage independent living : It is Government policy to enable older people to live independentlyas long as possible. Technology such as personalalarm services and tele-medicine can help. A range of barriers have deterred many older people from using e-services 1.14 Access to new technology is taken for granted by millions of people. Many have learned to use a computerat school or at work, and have acquired one for homeuse. As a result, the use of the internet has grown rapidlyover recent years. The number of households with accesstrebled between 1999 and 2002, and in September 2002an estimated 62 per cent of adults in Great Britain hadaccess at some time 23. 1.15 Concern has been expressed in this country and abroad about a 'digital divide' between those who arecomputer-literate and have access to informationtechnology and those who, for a variety of reasons, donot. Commonly, these are considered to include olderpeople, the disabled, those on low incomes, and other 19 NIACE, Winners and losers in an expanding system: The NIACE survey on adult population learning, (2001). 20 National Statistics, Living in Britain: Results from the 2000-01 General Household Survey (2001).21 e-Revenue (HC492, Session 2001-02).22 Section 508 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, as amended by Congress in 1998.23 (October 2002) National Statistics Omnibus Survey.16part onePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE groups such as those with literacy and numeracy difficulties. Differences between particular groups canbe significant. For example, 80 per cent of those in thehighest income level have access at home comparedwith 10 per cent in the lowest. 1.16 Evidence from a range of surveys 24over a number of years shows that older people are much less likely touse electronic services than other age groups. InSeptember 2002, only 17 per cent of those 65 or over had used the internet, compared with 94 per cent ofthose aged 16-24 and 47 per cent of those aged 55-64 25 (Figure 4) . Where older people do use it, it is for e-mail or to access information for learning and education,fact-finding (for example, about benefits, pensions andhealth issues, or via newspaper web pages, on worldevents), and for information on travel and hobbies. Ingeneral, older people have been reluctant to shop orbank on-line due to concerns about security. 1.17 Other countries show a similar pattern of lower usage by older people, although direct comparisons are difficultas surveys in other countries use different age ranges. Inthe United States of America, 37 per cent of people over50 had used the internet by September 2001, comparedwith 64 per cent of people aged between 25 and 49 26. Similarly, 19 per cent of Australians aged 55 and overhad used the internet in the 12 months to November2000, compared with 64 per cent of those agedbetween 25 and 39 27. 1.18 Research has shown that a range of factors deter particular groups of people from making use of e-services. Among all age groups, the most commonreason given was 'lack of interest' 28. Some 37 per cent of adults who had not used it, gave this asthe reason. Drawing on our focus groups, as well aspublished research, we identified eight key factors thatspecifically deter older people (Figure 5) . 1.19 However, there are also encouraging signs. In our discussions with groups of older people - both with andwithout experience of IT - there is clear evidence thatthey were not technophobes. Indeed, their feelingsabout computers tended in principle to be positive.Moreover, older people increasingly do not see theinternet and new technology as solely for the young.There is considerable evidence that, when shown thebenefits and uses that can be made of the internet, manyolder people are interested in learning more. And thosewho had used computers felt it had made a positivedifference to their lives and had been easier to masterthan expected. 1.20 There are other grounds for assuming that the figure will rise naturally. While the oldest generations havethe least interest, around three times as many of the55-64 cohort have used the internet 29. Many of this group have acquired IT skills in the workplace. Wordof mouth is also likely to extend take-up. At the sametime, other factors, in particular health barriers, arelikely to persist and may place a natural limit on take-up, unless there are technological developments toovercome these problems. However, even this may bemore about perceptions, since technical solutions areavailable to help those, for example, with poor sight. 1.21 In Part 2 we look at what government is doing to extend opportunities for older people to access arange of electronic media and in Part 3 at what theOffice of the e-Envoy and other departments andagencies (Figure 6) are doing to ensure government e-services are accessible to all. Details of ourmethodology are at Appendix A.Internet usage by adults in the UK4 Source: National Statistics6070 50 40 30 20 10 0 Oct 2001 Feb 2002 Jul 2002 Oct 2002per cent All adults 55-64 65 and older 24 Including National Statistics, Internet Access: households and individuals (2002); KPMG Consulting, Is Britain on Course for 2005 ?

Some of these effects are accelerated by the onset of degenerative diseases and conditions such as arthritis, diab etes and cataracts. While glasses or surgery can correct many eyesight problems, age causes the eye lens to yellow, making it more diffi cult to distinguish colours. The Royal National Institute of the Blind estimate that 75 per cent of the 1.1 million visually impaired p eople in Britain are aged 75 and over. Restricted hand movement, whether due to arthritis or osteoporosis, makes it difficult to use a c omputer mouse or keyboard. !A lack of confidence or familiarity with new technologies : Many older people and disadvantaged groups have not had the opportunity to learn how to use computers at work. Our focus groups suggested that the lack of opportunity to become familiar w ith the technology can create fear, including concern that they would break the computer or become addicted to the internet. In a K PMG Consulting survey in 200030, 36 per cent of older people who did not use the internet said that the main reason was that they did not understand it. Training or taster events are effective means of overcoming this obstacle. Our focus group research found th at even limited exposure to government websites whetted the appetites of participants to explore them further. Similarly, interest incr eases the more people use the internet, suggesting that exposure to it could well increase people's willingness to use government e-servi ces. !Costs : Average annual income is lower for older people than other age groups, and state benefits are the main source of income for many pensioners. As a consequence, not having the financial means to buy a computer, software, training and meet the telephoneexpenses prevents many people from accessing the internet. Many are concerned at the potential costs; for example, of being onl ine. Having easy access to the internet is essential if people are going to use government e-services. Providing good public provisi on of such facilities is one solution. However, market research indicates that people with internet access at home tend to use it mor e frequently than those who access it outside of home or work 31. !Language : If e-services contain too much jargon and technical information, the content will not be accessible. Moreover, older people who do not speak English as their first language will find it difficult to use computers to access the internet. Keyboards are mostly in English and are not usable for those languages that use a different character set. Solutions can include providing information in more than one language, offering interpretation services, and offering services via intermediaries such as community groups. !Learning and skills : Some user groups can be disadvantaged because they lack the educational skills to use new technologies. For example, some 20 per cent of the population have some literacy difficulty32. General education varies greatly among older people, and current mainstream technologies assume literacy skills and require the user to sift through large amounts of often complica ted information. BMRB found that interest from pensioners was higher among those with academic qualifications33. Pensioners were more likely than other groups to say that they have difficulty filling in forms. !Lack of perceived value : Using government e-services is unlikely to be the main reason for older people to want to use the internet. E-mail, leisure activities, education and hobbies are the most popular uses of the internet among older people. When dealing wi th public services, they have a strong preference for face-to-face discussion. A MORI survey commissioned in support of the Nation al Audit Office report on Tackling Pensioner Poverty (HC37 Session 2002-03) established that 50 per cent of pensioners seekinginformation and advice on benefits would prefer staff to visit them at home, and 38 per cent would prefer to talk to someone in person. Similarly, KPMG Consulting found that only 24 per cent of pensioners wanted to use government electronic transactional services 34. Participants in our focus groups tended to be more interested in learning about computers in order to 'keep up with the times' rather than to use any particular electronic service. The participants, especially those who had not used computers, often felt that t he internet was of no relevance to them. !Location : Older people tend to use publicly available e-services more if they are located in places that they would normally visit. For example, they are less likely than younger people to visit internet caf\u00e9s, but may feel more comfortable using services in comm unity centres or libraries. !Inaccessible design: Inaccessible web designs can mean that they cannot be read by the access technology, such as screen readers, that many people with disabilities rely on. 30 KPMG Consulting, Silver Surfers: The power of older people online (November 2000). 31 BMRB, Attitudes to electronic methods of conducting benefit business (2002).32 Department for Education & Skills, Fresh Start: Basic Skills for adults (March 2000).33 BMRB, Attitudes to electronic methods of conducting benefit business (2002).34 KPMG Consulting, E-Government for all (2001).18part onePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Role of the Office of the e-Envoy in encouraging take-up The Office of the e-Envoy, part of the Cabinet Office, have overall responsibility for meeting the objective of ensuring that e veryone who wants it has access to the internet by 2005. As part of this commitment, the Government aims to: !work to integrate all government internet access initiatives into one branded programme called UK online; !complete a network of 6,000 UK online internet access centres by the end of 2002 and work to sustain and improve therange and quality of services they offer; !support a local and national advertising and marketing campaign, both to raise awareness of the benefits of the internet, andto direct non-users to UK online services; !recognise information and communication technology (ICT) as a basic skill and continue working to embed it in theeducation system and throughout lifelong learning; and !continue working with industry to help people trust the internet. The Office of the e-Envoy have been concerned to ensure that departments are providing e-services that are useful and used by t he public, including older people. They have co-ordinated activities to improve physical access to the internet, encouraged depart ments to analyse the types of customer they serve and to tailor their services accordingly, and provided guidance to ensure departmen ts develop e-services accessible to all. The role of government departments and agenciesWhile the Office of the e-Envoy can provide advice to departments and monitor developments, they have no direct control over progress. Departments and agencies are responsible for delivering services to the public, and for developing initiatives to wid en access to e-services. Many departments are investing in e-services so as to increase the reach and quality of their services, i n part driven by the need to achieve a return on this investment. All the main central government departments submitted e-business strategies to the Office of the e-Envoy in summer 2001, showin g their commitment to making their services available electronically by 2005. The e-Envoy expects them to focus on improving thei r understanding of the pattern of service provision that will be most useful for different groups of customers, filling any signi ficant gaps in their strategies and delivering the services promised in them. Departments must comply both with guidelines issued by the Of fice of the e-Envoy on website design and with the Disability Discrimination Act's statutory Code of Practice on rights of access to goods, facilities, services and premises for disabled people.6Part 2 19 part two2.1 Part 1 highlighted barriers to greater use of e-services among older people. This part examines whatgovernment is doing to improve access to e-servicesfrom public places and from home. We examined fourtypes of initiative: !community access - to overcome the problem that many people do not have a computer at home and,in many cases, are unable to afford one. Access inpublic places also enables those unfamiliar withtechnology to seek advice; !home access - to overcome reluctance to using new technology in front of others; !advertising - to overcome lack of interest due to lack of knowledge of the benefits or existence of services;and !training - to overcome lack of familiarity with information technology, either by providing trainingcourses directly, or by offering funding to findsuitable training. 2.2 The Government is investing in a number of different projects of particular relevance to older people. TheNational Audit Office examined a number of thesewhich together will cost more than \u00a3450 million over aperiod of several years (Figure 7) .

They offer a number of benefits - a computer in a publicplace can be used by many people - and make betteruse of existing resources, for example, by providinganother reason for people to use libraries and colleges. 2.4 There are two major initiatives to provide public access to the internet: UK online centres and electronicinformation kiosks. (a) UK online centres 2.5 These are computer facilities in a range of locations, including high street premises or public libraries,community centres, colleges and local authority buildings,with staff available to help people access the internet(Case study A on page 22). The development of UKonline centres is founded on three initiatives (Figure 9) .2.6 In September 2000, the Prime Minister stated that there would be over 6,000 centres by the end of 2002. TheOffice of the e-Envoy were responsible for meeting thetarget, while the Department for Education and Skillsand the Department for Culture, Media and Sport wereresponsible for establishing the centres. The departmentswere to do this by setting up Information andCommunication Technology centres, putting UK onlinecentres into libraries, and by inviting existing internetcentres to be rebranded as UK online centres. The PrimeMinister announced at the e-Summit in November 2002that the target had been met six weeks ahead ofschedule (Figure 10) . 2.7 The People's Network programme (see Figure 9) to create Information and Communication Technologycentres in all public libraries has made good progress,with 1,951 public libraries having taken UK onlinebranding by the end of December 2002. Resource, whoare managing the project, estimate that up to a further1,150 libraries in England offered internet accessfacilities by the end of December 2002, but had not yetreceived UK online accreditation. Other countries are seeking to provide community access to the internet8 Australia. The Networking the Nation programme allocated A$421 million to fund the development of IT infrastructure, community access facilities and training. In addition, the Department of Transport andRegional Services had a A$70 million programme to provide places for people in rural communities toaccess the internet. Canada. Industry Canada aims to provide Canadians with affordable public access to the internet through the Canadian Access Program. There will be 10,000 centres in schools, libraries and communitycentres offering public access to the internet. European Union. Many member states have developed their own programmes: !Finland. The Government has a target that there should be one public access terminal per 1,000 people. This has been achieved in 30 per cent of municipalities. Some 180 GovernmentCitizens Offices and over 900 libraries provide internet access. !The Netherlands. In 2001 there were 1,050 public internet access points in the Netherlands, equivalent to one for every 15,000 people35. !Sweden. In 2001 there were some 3,400 public internet access points equivalent to one for every 2,600 people. 35 Commission of the European Communities, e-Inclusion: The Information Society's potential for social inclusion in Europe (2001).21 part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 2.8 Progress in setting up Information and Communication Technology centres in more deprived areas, funded bythe Capital Modernisation Fund and New OpportunitiesFund, was slower than planned. Only 750 were open bythe end of August 2002, against a plan of 2,000.However, 2,840 such centres had been opened by theend of 2002.The Department for Education and Skillsagreed a joint application process with the NewOpportunities Fund to prevent applicants from needingto complete two forms. An evaluation by the Departmentfor Education and Skills found that the majority ofapplications were processed within six months.Applicants had to wait until signed contracts were inplace before receiving capital and revenue funding, andin practice they often had to wait several weeks betweenreceiving approval for the capital funding and therevenue funding. 2.9 Applicants also faced funding difficulties. Most of the monies available (72 per cent) were ring-fenced forcapital expenditure, with only \u00a377.5 million for runningcosts. New Opportunities Fund officials and staff at theGovernment Offices for the Regions have workedclosely with applicants to find alternative sources of funding and to trim anticipated running costs so projectscan proceed. 2.10 The Office of the e-Envoy estimated that 98.6 per cent of the population in England would live within 5 milesof a UK online centre when the network was rolled out,giving almost full national coverage. However, theDepartment for Education and Skills have haddifficulties in determining how many people have usedthe existing centres funded by the Capital ModernisationFund because around 60 per cent are not submittingregular management information each quarter, despite arequirement to do so. Data from 576 centres that did sofor the quarter ending September 2002 showed around66,300 new users - equivalent to nine per centre eachday. Of these, nearly 15,300 were aged over 55, 5,900 people were disabl ed, 3,500 had been unemployed for over 6 months and 13,200 were fromethnic minorities. 2.11 An interim evaluation report 36on the UK online centres (March 2002) found that 80 per cent of users had accessto the internet elsewhere (although over half had neversent an email or used the internet and so needed supportand guidance), and there are significant variations in theperformance of centres in attracting target groups(Figure 11) . The New Opportunities Fund consider it is not unusual at an early stage of a funding programme forthe most disadvantaged groups to remain wary ofcomputer training opportunities. The NewOpportunities Fund staff visited approximately 15 per cent of centres through launches and pre-arranged meetings in 2002 to discuss good practice andthe challenges centres might face. To date, there are noarrangements by the Department for Education andSkills or the New Opportunities Fund to visit centresunannounced in order to assess quality, although thismay form part of a revised monitoring process in future.There are three initiatives to provide UK online centres !Information and Communication Technology learning centres. The scheme aims to provide centres in the most deprived local authority wards in England, or rural areas with significant transport problems, to give internet access to disadvantaged groups . The project was allocated \u00a3199 million of capital funding from the Capital Modernisation Fund and \u00a377.5 million from the NewOpportunities Fund to support running costs. Local groups interested in setting up such a centre seek advice from their localGovernment Office for the Region to apply for funding. The Department for Education and Skills and the New Opportunities FundBoard took the final decision on whether to provide capital and revenue funding respectively. !The People's Network . Resource (the Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries), in collaboration with the New Opportunities Fund, set out to provide computers and internet access in over 3,000 libraries in England by the end of 2002. In England thenetwork received \u00a377.5 million funding from the New Opportunities Fund to provide libraries with ICT equipment and connectivityand a further \u00a316.2 million to train library staff in information communication technology skills and learner support. !Internet caf\u00e9s and community schemes. The Department for Education and Skills have also invited existing centres, such as internet caf\u00e9s and community-based projects to apply for the UK online centre brand. Although no funding is available, they benefit from the national marketing and communication campaigns and from practical support.9 Progress in establishing UK online centres Type of centre Number of centres by end of 2002 Information and Communication 2,840 Technology learning centres Centres in libraries 1,9511 Existing centres that applied for 1,550 UK online centres brand Total 6,341 NOTE1. The figure may be understated as the accreditation process for libraries to acquire UK online centre branding takesplace at six monthly intervals. By June 2002, 2,356 publiclibraries offered internet access facilities.10 36 Hall Aitken, UK online centres (CMF Funded) - initial report (September 2002).22 part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE UK online centres are provided in many accessible places and provide an introduction to the internet. In September 2000 the Prime Minister announced a commitment to develop a network ofover 6,000 UK online centres in England by the end of 2002. The overall objective of UK onlinecentres is to provide access to the internet and email for those who would not otherwise have accessnear to where they live. Centres are aimed at those with no or low Information and CommunicationTechnology skills, including people who need help with basic skills, people from ethnic minorities,those over 60 not involved in learning activities, and people with disabilities. They are also designedto provide an affordable service for those on low incomes. The centres aim to help people to developthe skills to use the internet to access information and to explore the opportunities that newtechnologies offer such as for further learning and updating skills. Centres may be publicly or privately run. The criteria for becoming a UK online centre include: supporting the government strategy for e-Government by helping people to learn how to usecomputers; and demonstrating clear links to other facilities such as learndirect training courses,library facilities and local colleges. The original policy team was established in the (former) Department for Education and Employment, with a steering board which included representatives from the Department, HM Treasury, theDepartment for Trade and Industry, the (former) Department for Environment, Transport and theRegions, Number 10 Policy Unit, Cabinet Office, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, UfIand the New Opportunities Fund. Each centre is different, but they typically offer computers with staff on hand to whom people can go for advice. Details about the nearest centre and its opening hours are available by calling the freephonenumber 0800 77 1234 or by using the website at www.dfes.gov.uk/ukonlinecentres. Centres eithercharge a nominal fee or offer free training. For example, library authorities were asked to provideinternet access free of charge or have policies in place to ensure that groups at risk of social exclusioncan have their needs met. In the majority of libraries, access will be available at no cost to the user. By June 2002, 2,356 public libraries in England offered public internet access, and by December 2002 1,951 had taken UK online centre branding. An additional 1,550 existing internet centres havesuccessfully applied for the UK online centre brand, and the Department for Education and Skillshave approved a further 2,840 centres for funding in deprived areas. The Government believes that the initiative has reached many small community organisations and disadvantaged areas, and has strengthened and created many local partnerships. The target of 6,000 UK online centres was achieved in November 2002. Regional and national awards have beenheld to recognise and celebrate successes of users, support staff and centres. A dedicated onlineresource is available for centres, along with a marketing toolkit. Confidence and familiarity: The centres provide support to help users learn how to use the internet, and send emails. Satisfaction rates among users with centre staff and learning materials are high, anda majority of respondents believe attending a UK online centre has increased their confidence with technology. Awareness: Placing UK online centres in community locations has increased the visibility of e-services. However, there is little evidence that centres are actively encouraging users to try government e-services. Social Exclusion: The centres that receive public funding are targeted at deprived areas and excluded groups. An evaluation in 2002 by Hall Aitken found that centres varied in their performance inattracting users from target groups. They found that at eight centres all the users were from targetgroups, while at two centres fewer than 30 per cent were from such groups.Introduction How do you use the service? Achievements Overcoming barriersCASE STUDY A: UK online centres23 part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 2.12 The sustainability of UK online centres is a key issue. The New Opportunities Fund provision of running costsfor Capital Modernisation Fund-supported UK onlinecentres is for a maximum of three years, and only 5 per cent of revenue funds can be used for capitalreplacement. Although the New Opportunities Fundasked applicants to show how they intended to continuebeyond the period of funding as part of the assessmentprocess, difficulties in attracting funding from elsewheremean that many remain dependent on public funding tocover running costs. Moreover, some of those centresbest placed to reach disadvantaged target groups arelikely to be least able to find funds from elsewhere. Forpublic libraries, funding for equipment will cease inMarch 2003 and for training in March 2004. All revenuecosts will be met by local authorities. The NewOpportunities Fund stated that the Lottery is unlikely tobe a source of future revenue funding for UK online centres, given that one of its principles, as made clear byGovernment policy directions, is that Lottery funds arefor specific, one-off interventions that are time-limited. 2.13 Some Capital Modernisation Fund-funded centres face closure without further support. The funding for the firsttranche finished in January 2003 and some of the morerecent centres were given revenue funding for only oneyear. If UK online centres are forced to close, it is notclear whether there will be sufficient resources availableto set up a replacement in the vicinity. 2.14 As well as UK online centres, the Department for Education and Skills have also launched an initiative to providewireless laptop computer networks for adult learninginstitutions and community groups. The Wireless OutreachNetwork will provide \u00a37.9 million by March 2003 to organisations which will purchase up to 25 laptopseach for use in training economically and sociallydisadvantaged adults. The organisations are expected tosatisfy the criteria used to select UK online centres. (b) Information Kiosks 2.15 Information kiosks (see Case Study B on pages 24-25 for an example) are stand-alone terminals placed in publicbuildings, such as shopping centres, railway stations orGP surgeries. People can access information bytouching the screen and using simple menus. Someprovide the option to print out information to read later.We examined three separate trials (Figure 12) .Figure 13 illustrates a typical kiosk. 2.16 Early evidence on the benefits of the kiosks has been patchy. Evaluation of the Post Office kiosks trial inLeicestershire and Rutland 37found an estimated 150,000 people had used them, of whom 92 per centrated them as 'very useful' or 'fairly useful'. Theevaluation of the StartHere pilots in Scotland alsoestablished that a large majority found the kiosks easy touse, thought they contained valuable information, andThe success of a sample of UK online centres in attracting people from socially excluded groups to attend11 Source: Hall Aitken 2002012345678910 0-910-19 40-49 50-5960-69 70-79 80-8990-9910020-2930-39Some centres have been more successful in attracting people from socially excluded groups than others. While every user at 8 centres was from a socially excluded group, at two centres fewer than 30 per cent were. Number of centres Percentage of respondents in the target group The development of kiosks by departments !Department of Health kiosks. In April 1999, the Prime Minister announced the intention to extend NHS Direct through information points. Representatives from Age Concern, the Royal National Institute of the Blind and wheelchair users were invited to testprototypes to ensure the chosen model would be accessible and user friendly. The information on the kiosks is a downloadedversion of the NHS Direct Online website, rewritten in a format suitable for touch-screen application. The Department of Healthaimed to have 120 kiosks in place by the end of 2000, and over 500 by 2004. Progress has been slower than planned. TheDepartment of Health let the contract to purchase the first 150 kiosks in September 2000, at a cost of just under \u00a31 million. T here are currently 180 such kiosks in operation. !Kiosks in Post Offices. A six-month pilot was undertaken to provide kiosks in 212 Post Offices in Leicestershire and Rutland. These provided advice on how to get the best out of retirement, information on how to find work and community facilities. Additionall y, four outlets provided practical opportunities to learn how to use the internet. The pilot cost \u00a325 million, but in October 2002ministers decided not to roll out a publicly funded service. !StartHere kiosks. The Scottish Office provided \u00a30.5 million to the charity StartHere to provide kiosks in Dumfries and Galloway. The kiosks give access to information on health, carers' concerns, children, transport, education, citizens' rights, and on money a nd benefits. Installation began in April 2002, primarily in police stations, hospitals and community schools. 12 37 Department of Trade & Industry, Evaluation of the 'Your Guide' service of Post Offices as Government General Practitioners (20 02).24part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE would be keen to use them again. By contrast, an initial evaluation of the Department of Health kiosks38, in December 2001, found few people had used them.Forty-two per cent of the surrounding population hadvisited the building in which their health kiosk was sitedin the past 12 months. Of these, 36 per cent had seen it,but only 7 per cent had used it. People over 65 were thelowest users. More than one quarter of the people whohad seen it but not used the kiosk had not recognisedwhat it was.2.17 Doubts remain over whether kiosks offer cost-effective services to the public. The evaluation of Post Officekiosks reported that only 15 per cent of users said thatthey could not have found the information elsewhere.On the basis of the pilot findings departments wereunable to identify the potential for significant efficiencysavings likely to result from a national scheme. 2.18 Consequently, the future of kiosks remains uncertain. The Department of Health contract for maintenance ofits existing 180 kiosks terminated at the end of 2002,and they have not earmarked any funds for a furthercontract to run the existing kiosks or the installation ofthe remaining 320 required by 2004. In October 2002,ministers decided not to take forward the publiclyfunded kiosk service in Post Offices on the grounds thatit would neither significantly improve governmentdepartments' ability to meet their objectives norgenerate a viable level of income for Post Office Limitedand its branches. There is a commercial interest inplacing kiosks in Post Offices, but the Post Office doesnot currently have any plans to have them in branches.A business consortium is currently developing a schemefor commercial kiosks in Cornwall, due to be piloted in2003. The Post Office stated that they will view theoutcome with interest. An electronic information kiosk13 A kiosk in a medical centre. Kiosks cost around \u00a36,000. Typically they have been sited in convenient, trusted locationssuch as pharmacies, Post Offices and health centres. Evidenceto date suggests they are easy to use for most people. The introduction of Information Points was announced by the Prime Minister in April 1999. These touch-screen kiosks are intended to improve access to healthcare information and facilitate betteruse of healthcare resources. The specific objectives of the kiosks are: !extending public access to NHS Direct Online; !providing access to information in supported environments; !complementing local plans for improving access to good quality health information; and !further raising the profile of NHS Direct. The kiosks are specifically aimed at those members of the public who do not have access to a personal computer or who are not comfortable using standard technology, such as older people, lowearners and the homeless. They contain information from NHS Direct Online (www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk)which was adapted for use on touch screens. Information on the kiosks is updated regularly via anISDN telephone connection, which also allows monitoring of usage records. The kiosks were positioned in a variety of locations, some of which had already been identified as 'high usage' locations by previous evaluators of other health information kiosks projects. Theseincluded: supermarkets, pharmacies, walk-in centres, A&E departments in hospitals and libraries.Less tested locations included Dover ferry terminal, caf\u00e9s, job centres and leisure centres. Each kiosk costs \u00a36,000, delivered and installed. This does not include call charges, installation of phone lines, line rental (\u00a399 per kiosk per year), or maintenance (estimated at \u00a31000 per kiosk peryear). The host organisation is required to meet the costs of power supply to the kiosk. The contractfor supply and maintenance of kiosks was worth just under \u00a31m in the first year (for 150 kiosks).The contract ended at the end of 2002 with as yet no plans for ongoing maintenance.Introduction CASE STUDY B: NHS DIRECT INFORMATION POINTS 38 University of Plymouth, Evaluation of NHS Kiosks (December 2001).25 part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE There is no cost for using the kiosks. Touching the screen on the appropriate icons via a series of menu screens allows the user to access information on a wide range of health information includinga healthcare guide, conditions and treatment look up facility, information on healthy living, andanswers to frequently asked questions. Kiosks are installed with printers, allowing users to print off the required information to be read or re-read at a later date. Some of the kiosks are also installed with a telephone to allow users to usethe NHS Direct telephone helpline free of charge. Host organisations' staff are trained in how to help users, although support is more likely in healthcare environments such as pharmacies, health and walk-in centres and hospitals, than inshopping centres or ferry terminals. The programme was evaluated by Dr Ray Jones of Glasgow University (now of University of Plymouth) between September 2000 and October 2001 39, using routine statistics for all kiosks, an exit poll of a sample of sites and a postal survey of people living within a 5 kilometre radius of thesample sites. Because of the early stage of the programme, problems with siting and lack of visibility,results proved inconclusive on the kiosks' role in achieving equitable access to e-services andreducing the digital divide. Usage of the kiosks was low in comparison with earlier research of kiosk usage in Scotland in the early 1990s. This may reflect greater availability of health information or a need for better siting andvisibility of the NHS Direct kiosks. Not knowing the kiosk existed or where it was sited was thesecond most common reason for non-use, given by 28 per cent of respondents to the postal survey.The most common reason was that people preferred to ask a health professional. Thirty-one per centof those interviewed at the site said they did not know what it was. Some kiosks recorded very high usage and this has continued to grow. For example, the kiosk situated at Dover ferry terminal had more than 4,000 users in February and April 2002, with averagemonthly usage at just over 1600 for the period since June 2001. Other kiosks recorded very lowusage, such as Cornwall College with only 14 average monthly users since June 2001. Leisurecentres, tourist sites and supermarkets recorded highest usage and education sites the least. Usability: Representatives of target user groups were invited to test and comment on kiosk prototypes, to ensure that universal usability was achieved. Touch-screen technology meant thatusers did not have to negotiate their way around a keyboard or mouse and a printer facility enablesusers to re-read information. The evaluation found that users generally found the kiosks easy or veryeasy to use. Awareness: Awareness of the kiosks appears to have been low, with some kiosks positioned in less visible locations, often to ensure privacy for users. Local NHS Direct offices were responsible forawareness raising and advertising campaigns and the Department provided guidance andsuggestions on how and where this might be done, although the budget for such work was limited.The Department have not evaluated the effectiveness of marketing initiatives.How do you use the service? Achievements Overcoming barriersCASE STUDY B: NHS DIRECT INFORMATION POINTS (continued) 39 University of Plymouth, Evaluation of NHS Kiosks (December 2001).26part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE The Government is testing several ways of developing access fromhome but this has raised a numberof legal and practical issues 2.19 While the Government has sought to promote public access, research suggests many older people prefer toaccess e-services from home. This may partly reflect alack of awareness of public access points, but also aconviction that using the internet is a private activity. We examined three main developments: providingrefurbished computers to those unable to afford them;developing digital television services; and the use of callcentres for older people. (a) refurbished computers have succeeded in reaching many disadvantaged groups 2.20 The r apid pace of technological development means many organisations regularly replace computers afteronly a few years. Recycled computers could provideaccess to internet services for people who do not own a personal computer, making good use of existingresources. However, there are drawbacks. Old computerequipment is likely to be unreliable and prone to breakdown, and there are issues about continuing legalliability. It is also difficult to eradicate existing data from a computer without physically breaking its harddisk drive, and unless IT equipment has sufficientprocessing capacity it will not be suitable to supportspecialist access technology needed by people withimpaired sight. The Department for Education and Skillshave run two projects, both of which have included older people (Figure 14) .2.21 The Computers Within Reach initiative was targeted at those receiving Job Seekers Allowance, Income Support,Incapacity Benefit, or the state pension with MinimumIncome Guarantee. An evaluation 40found the pilots were broadly successful in targeting people who did nothave access to a computer, with 84 per cent ofrespondents reporting this was the first time theirhousehold had owned one. Most (83 per cent) weresatisfied with their machine, and research concludedthat the computers appeared to have had a significantpositive effect on recipients. 2.22 However, there have been problems. Just under half of respondents encountered difficulties with their computer.As a consequence, many ceased to use them. The projectwas terminated after suppliers had distributed 24,000 machines at a cost of \u00a37.1 million - equivalentto \u00a3296 per machine. These costs reflect delivery,installation, maintenance, software, a printer and anoperating system. The scheme encountered a number ofproblems in sourcing and distribution. In particular: !delays in letting the contracts and the need toreplace some organisations meant suppliers hadonly six months, instead of the planned 12, to findthe machines; !the scheme influenced the second-hand market forcomputers of the required specification and, as aconsequence, prices rose; !there were legal difficulties with insuring thecomputers and with the responsibility for repairingdefective units; and !it proved difficult for organisations to determine ifsomeone was eligible to receive a machine andsome providers commented that the training hadinitially put some people off. 2.23 The Wired Up Communities initiative, launched in March 2000, aims to test whether IT could be used toimprove education, social cohesion and employment ina small number of rural and inner-city areas. ByDecember 2002, some 9,000 homes and othercommunity locations had been connected to theinternet, and set up their own online communities. Aninterim evaluation 41suggested the scheme was having a positive impact. Take-up has been highest among theunemployed , those not working through ill-health, andretired people. However, the initiative has been subjectto some slippage. As with the Computers Within Reachscheme, there have been problems in meeting insurancecosts and attracting private sector sponsorship. Projects to provide refurbished computers to overcome the digital divide ! Computers Within Reach . An initiative to purchase refurbished computers and distribute them to targetedpeople at a nominal price. It was originally funded with\u00a315 million and ran from October 2000 to October 2001.There were 22 pilots in Birmingham, Hull, Leeds,Liverpool, London, Manchester, Portsmouth, Plymouthand South Yorkshire. The Department for Education andSkills let contracts with computer refurbishers andconsortia to provide and distribute the computers.Recipients paid a nominal \u00a360 for each computer andsome basic training which - where applicable - waspaid in instalments over several weeks. ! Wired Up Communities . A pilot to encourage deprived communities to use IT, including the provision ofdiscounted computers and digital television decodingboxes. Designed to improve education, social cohesionand employment in a small number of communities,the pilot scheme provided \u00a310 million in March 2000to launch seven initiatives run by local partnerships. 14 40 SQW Limited, Evaluation of Computers Within Reach: A final report to the Department for Education and Skills (2002). 41 Leeds Metropolitan University Policy Research Institute, Evaluation of Wired-Up Communities Interim Report (2002).27 part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE (b) Digital TV and call centres build on older people's existing knowledge and experience 2.24 Digital television (Case studies C and D on pages 29-32) offers an increased choice of channels, improved pictureand sound quality, and the opportunity to interact withthe broadcaster. It could provide the opportunity, forexample, to shop, pay bills, talk to a care worker, orcontact a relative easily. The Office of the e-Envoy areseeking to act as an exemplar for other public bodies inhow to use digital television to deliver governmentservices. In April 2002 they launched UK onlineInteractive, and published a draft policy framework on theuse of digital television for the delivery of e-governmentservices in October 2002. Two other departments - theDepartment of Health and the Department for Work andPensions - have begun pilot services (Figure 15) , and we identified a further 19 departments and agencies thatplanned to develop them. 2.25 One advantage of this medium is that many people (including significant numbers of older people) arealready familiar with the technology. Using a remotecontrol may, for many, be more intuitive than internetservices accessed via a personal computer. Multimediacontent such as audio and video presentation can be usedas well as text. Unlike the internet, those with onetelephone line can call for assistance while using theservice. However, there are risks. Interactive services areexpensive to develop and the market remains volatile - asevidenced by the collapse in 2002 of both ITV Digital andDKTV (which had been involved with the NHS scheme). 2.26 Public interest in digital television suggests it has the potential to overcome the 'digital divide', although therewill be need for sustained education and marketing forsome groups. Forty three per cent of people are nowdigital viewers, with many more expected to switchwithin the next five years 42. A Department for Work and Pensions survey in 200243found that 16 per cent of pensioners had used digital TV, although older peopleare heavily represented among those who know nothingabout it. The Government intends to maintain terrestrialanalogue television until everyone who currentlyreceives the main public service broadcasting channelscan receive them digitally and switching to the digitalservice is an affordable option for 95 per cent of users.The target timetable for meeting these criteria, so thatanalogue signals can be switched off, is 2006-2010. 2.27 The Government has taken a careful approach to digital TV. Pilot schemes were launched with minimal publicity,and thus, early figures on take-up were low. On average,some 1,200 people per day contacted the UK onlineInteractive service between April and June 2002. TheDepartment for Work and Pensions received 300 emailsand telephone calls from viewers requesting a leaflet orfurther information in September 2002, and the typicalnumber of callers to the NHS pilots ranged from under10 for one pilot to around 500 a week for the LivingHealth project. Trialling digital television services15 UK online: The digital television version of the UK online portal became available on BSkyB in April 2002 and is likely to be extended to ntl and Telewest. The Office of the e-Envoy expect the pilots to cost \u00a3750,000.The aim is to provide a launch point for government services on digital TV so that all local authority anddepartmental websites are accessed this way. The Pension Service: The service has been available via cable (ntl and Telewest) since May 2002 and on satellite (Sky Active) since October 2002. The pilot will end in June 2003 at a total cost of \u00a32.5 million, ofwhich \u00a31.9 million is funded by HM Treasury through the Invest to Save Fund. The service providesinformation to people making decisions about their financial future, for example, details about the statepension and ways in which they may be able to supplement it. It also provides information about how peoplecan review their retirement income. Viewers are able to request pension-related leaflets and report certainchanges in circumstance. A telephone support service is available if viewers have any questions. NHS Direct: The Department of Health launched four pilots to promote health issues, at a total cost of \u00a36.3 million. These were: Living Health (featuring a range of TV applications including NHS Direct InVision, which allowed people to talk to and see a nurse, a system for booking an appointment with a GP through thetelevision, and over 20,000 pages of information on local NHS services and health advice); Communicopia (which enabled viewers to access key sets of data from the NHS Direct website, as well as video clips and atext-messaging reminder service for vaccinations); Channel Health (piloted a series of broadcast programmes dealing with health and financial issues relevant to pregnant woman); DKTV (provided interactive television and allowed users to access local service providers and national government information via television). 42 MORI, Digital Television 2002 Final Report (May 2002). 43 BMRB, Attitudes to electronic methods of conducting benefit business (2002).28part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 2.28 Call centres provide mediated access to e-services. To assess their suitability for improving access to e-services, we examined three call centres operated bythe Department for Work and Pensions and used by manyolder people (Figure 16) . We also examined progress in increasing use of NHS Direct amongst older people. 2.29 Compared with other methods of delivering e-services, call centres have been successful in attracting olderpeople. In 2001-02 Pensions Direct (Case study E, pages 33-34) received 1.1 million calls, the MinimumIncome Guarantee call centre received 165,000 calls,and the National Pensions teleclaims centre received430,000 calls. Of the estimated 490,000 people due toretire in 2001-02, 310,000 (63 per cent) chose tocomplete their retirement pension claim form over thetelephone. The services also appear to have had apositive impact on the take-up of benefits (covered inour report on Tackling Pensioner Poverty: encouraging take-up of entitlements (HC 37, Session 2002-03)). An evaluation 44in 2001 of the Minimum Income Guarantee teleclaims service found that 53 per cent ofcallers would not have completed a claim form if theyhad not been able to do so over the telephone. 2.30 The success of call centres might be due, in part, to a greater awareness among the public. The telephonenumber for Pensions Direct is advertised on annualstatements and newsletters sent to those who receive theirpensions via their bank accounts, and can also be foundon departmental leaflets. Everyone approachingretirement receives a letter inviting them to call theNational Pensions teleclaims centre to claim theirretirement pension. And the Minimum Income Guaranteecentre telephones people three months after they havecontacted the National Pensions teleclaims service.Further information on the performance of governmentcall centres is available in our report Using call centres to deliver public services (HC 134 Session 2002-03).Department for Work and Pensions call centres ! The National Pensions teleclaims service, introduced in 2000, is for people approaching pensionable age tocomplete their claim forms with the help of operators. ! Pensions Direct is a telephone service, available nationally since 1994, that allows people who receivetheir state retirement pension direct into their bankaccount to notify the department of any changes ofcircumstances and to raise any general enquiries aboutthe service. ! The Minimum Income Guarantee call centre, introduced in 2000, enables older people to complete MinimumIncome Guarantee claim forms over the telephone. 16 44 IFF Research Limited, Evaluation of the Minimum Income Guarantee Claim Line (2001).29 part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE The Department of Health ran four pilot projects exploring the health applications of digital interactive television: Living Health transmitted a largely text-based health information service to Telewest cable television subscribers in Birmingham, together with an experimental GP appointments booking service andInVision - a video nurse from an NHS Direct call centre who appeared on the caller's screen as theyspoke to each other over the telephone. The pilot was launched in June 2001 and ran untilNovember 2001 (although Telewest ran the service for another 6 months at their own expense). Theservice was transmitted to 35-40,000 Telewest subscribers. The contract was worth \u00a34 million. Communicopia provided a digital TV version of the NHS Direct service, a mixture of text-based and video-on-demand. Users were also provided with interactive options such as health quizzesand a text messaging reminder service for immunisation dates. The service was launched inNovember 2001 to an audience of 10,000 in Kingston upon Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshireand ended in May 2002. The service was also launched on Video Network's HomeChoice platformin February 2002 as a pilot to viewers in London. Contract value was \u00a31.2 million. Channel Health presented a series of broadcast TV programmes to a national audience of over 5.7 million, with linked interactive services via the Sky satellite system. The programmes dealt withhealth issues relating to pregnancy and provided, on a local basis, the ability to interact with healthprofessionals via email support links. The programmes ran from October 2001, with interactivitypossible from January 2002. The pilot ended in March 2002. Value of the contract was \u00a31.2 million. DKTV delivered a service, initially to residents of the London Borough of Newham, via the HomeChoice platform. The service offered interactive links to local and national governmentinformation together with video-on-demand, allowing users to find out more about services onoffer to them. Available only on broadband, services were transmitted to around 500 potentialusers. The service was available from August 2001 until June 2002. NHS Direct was one of anumber of investors in this pilot project and the contract value was therefore considerably less thanthe other pilots at \u00a3250,000. The Department did not develop a business case for piloting digital interactive TV, since the pilots were not aimed at developing specific services. The Department of Health is currently formulatinga 'lessons learned' paper for submission to ministers with recommendations for future use. Thepaper will include costed business cases for future options. The four pilot projects used different technologies and digital television providers. Subscribers to the relevant digital television providers could find each service via a series of menus on thetelevision screen, using the remote control and/or keyboard. Levels of interactivity differed between the services. Channel Health provided a maternity guide as an enhancement to their broadcast television series and users were prompted to press the redbutton on their Sky remote control to view it. The only cost for the user was in sending emails usingtheir Sky remote control. On the NHS Direct Digital service provided by Communicopia , users were able to select and receive video and audio content by using their remote control or keyboard.Because the platform used to deliver the service in Hull was broadband, no dial-up was requiredin order to interact. DKTV 's services were not broadcast but cached on servers, allowing users to start and stop the video clips at any time. The service was added free of charge to all subscribers to the HomeChoiceplatform in the Newham area. Living Health used a cable platform to deliver its services, which meant there was no extra cost if users wanted to interact. The service offered significant levels ofinteractivity, some of it very innovative. As well as being able to view 21,000 pages of healthinformation text, users could book an appointment with the GP or see and speak to a nurse. Introduction How do you use the service?CASE STUDY C: NHS DIRECT INTERACTIVE DIGITAL TELEVISION30part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE The four pilots were evaluated by a team from City University and University of Sheffield. The Department also commissioned usability testing by Serco. The pilots offered very distinctiveservices, including the type of platform, the amount and nature of content, the presentationalformats, degree of interactivity and potential audiences. The research has not been able to identifyclearly what types of interactive digital TV services are most appropriate for what types of audienceand delivered through what type of medium. The main findings were: !An audience of over 200,000 are thought to have used one or other of the pilot services. !The pilots attracted larger numbers of men than other forms of health information, particularly older men. !Digital interactive TV attracts low-income users, therefore supporting the argument that it canhelp to combat the digital divide, reaching the less well-off and socially excluded. !Older users were more likely to experience difficulties in using the services, although thelearning curve tends to be lower than, say, for the NHS kiosks, particularly in households wherethe television plays a greater role. !Satisfaction levels varied but some services did very well. 100 per cent of the users of theInVision service (which allowed users to see and speak to a nurse) said they would use theservice again and/or recommend it to friends. !In comparison with NHS Direct information kiosks and the website, digital interactive TVattracted more repeat visits (although there were was no competition during the pilots), userstook longer to view a screen, viewed more pages, and spent the most time viewing, suggestingthat viewing a health information system at home has significant benefits. !The concept of delivering health information via digital interactive TV was popular withrespondents, but identifying user needs and designing services around those needs was crucialif such services were to deliver on their potential. Social Exclusion: The pilots were run in order to test and explore new technology. The Department had identified digital interactive television as a means of supporting those people at home who donot have easy access to a health professional. It is also seen as a more appropriate means to reachlower socio-economic groups who are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with using the internet. Accessible design: The evaluation found that ease of use varied with the individual user and the nature of the service being used. Users of the interactive maternity guide on Channel Health foundit almost universally easy to use. In contrast, only 28 per cent of Living Health respondents found itvery easy to find information. Visibility and menu position of services was found to be crucial. Thenumber of clicks required to reach content is a critical feature with digital interactive TV services. Awareness: Usage of the video-on-demand service offered by Living Health increased significantly when the service was advertised locally. Cost: The pilot services were free to users (except the cost of sending emails on the Channel Health service).Achievements Overcoming barriersCASE STUDY C: NHS DIRECT INTERACTIVE DIGITAL TELEVISION (continued)31 part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE The Pension Service are piloting the use of digital TV to provide information and services to the public. In May 2002, they launched an interactive service for pensions, known as The PensionService's interactive digital television pilot. The aim is to identify and evaluate the potential forusing this channel to deliver services to a wider range of customers. The project has a budget of\u00a32.5 million over two years. The pilot service is aimed at people planning for and approaching retirement and those who have already retired. It is accessible via a range of satellite and cable TV services. To access The Pension Service's interactive digital television pilot, the viewer must select it from the range of interactive services available via digital television. Other services that are available inthis way include banking and shopping. To navigate around the service and to enter data, usersemploy the remote control and/or keyboard that is provided by the digital television supplier. The service consists principally of information on state and private pensions, but also includes information on pension-related benefits and information on a range of supporting services andorganisations. Interactive features include ordering leaflets and a state pension age calculator,while people who receive their pensions via automated credit transfer can also inform theDepartment for Work and Pensions of a change in their circumstances. The Pension Service's interactive digital television pilot is available to subscribers of ntl, Telewest and Sky Digital. There is no additional charge for accessing information using The Pension Service'sinteractive digital television pilot. However, interactive options on Sky Digital will incur phonecharges at local rates. It is too early to assess the impact of The Pension Service's interactive digital television pilot although the Department for Work and Pensions have engaged MORI Social Research to evaluatethe pilot by Spring 2003. The Department for Work and Pensions are using the pilot to gaininformation about customers, so they did not attempt to estimate usage prior to launch and haveno targets for take-up of the service. However, the Department report that early data isencouraging, with an online survey generating very positive feedback and usage figures increasingconsiderably in response to banner and button advertising. While the Department for Work and Pensions hope that the service will reduce the number of nugatory claims for pensions and lead to administrative savings, they have not quantified as yethow much resource could be saved. There are technical limits on the data that can be collected on the usage of satellite TV services. Unlike cable services, satellite services will only record the number of visits made to interactiveservices. If users browse the information available at The Pension Service's interactive digitaltelevision pilot but do not use interactive services, this will not be recorded in usage statistics. Introduction How do you use the service? AchievementsCASE STUDY D: THE PENSION SERVICE'S INTERACTIVE DIGITAL TELEVISION PILOT 32part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Appropriate content: The Department for Work and Pensions identified stakeholders and held workshops with them to discuss content, interactivity and marketing strategies. The stakeholderswere mainly drawn from departmental personnel who had a lot of experience of working eitherwith electronic communications or with communications aimed at older people. They also held aconcept testing meeting, in which potential customers were asked about their expectations of ThePension Service's interactive digital television pilot. This research highlighted some importantbarriers to take-up by older people, including: !not being convinced of the benefits of the service !feeling that interactive television is slow and liable to crash !perceptions that the service is aimed at younger people !reluctance to provide personal information in case it was used for other purposes by the Government. The strong points of the design were that it was simple to use and that it can employ videos effectively to communicate with users. Usability: A key limitation of digital television is that it is not possible to have more than 30-40 words of text on each page. One solution to this has been to use video to pass informationto the viewer. The Sky Digital version of The Pension Service's interactive digital television pilotincludes short videos that explain what the service offers. The Department for Work and Pensionsfound that it was a challenge to restrict the length of interactive forms. The form regarding 'loss ofa loved one' ran to 32 pages. It was decided to exclude this form from the pilot service. Awareness: The service will be publicised via a combination of regional publicity exercises and advertising via providers of digital TV subscription services. There will also be an internal marketingstrategy to ensure that Department for Work and Pensions staff are aware of the service. Duringconcept testing, users commented that they would not use the service unless they had beendirected to it by other channels such as the Post Office, websites and newspaper, magazine andtelevision advertisements. Live running suggests that this is not necessarily the case in practice, asusers are accessing the service and ordering leaflets following the appearance of banner advertsand by browsing. Accessibility: The text is available in English, and a Welsh service is being developed. In the next phase of development, the Department for Work and Pensions will be reviewing how to provideinformation contained in the video presentations to people with hearing difficulties. User behaviour and expectations: Producers of digital TV services find that users tend to browse for shorter periods of time than they might browse websites. For this reason, and due to restrictionson the amount of text information that can be provided on-screen, the Department for Work andPensions see The Pension Service's interactive digital television pilot as a signposting service. Theywant to use it to raise awareness of issues relevant to current and future pensioners, and toencourage them to take further action once they have viewed the information. A specialist teamhas been set up to handle phone calls and emails arising from use of The Pension Service'sinteractive digital television pilot. During concept testing, users had anticipated that the servicewould provide different services from those offered by the Department for Work and Pensions. Inparticular, they expected that it would offer information on different pension providers and mightinclude a pension calculator.Overcoming barriers CASE STUDY D: THE PENSION SERVICE'S INTERACTIVE DIGITAL TELEVISION PILOT 33 part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Pensions Direct is a telephone service for people who receive their retirement pensions via their bank accounts. Pensioners can use the service to report changes of circumstances, such as alteringbank details, or to get help with more general enquiries. The annual cost of running the PensionsDirect service is \u00a32.1million. The service has been available nationally since 1994. The call centre, located in Newcastle, employs 124 agents. Two other teleclaims centres at Newcastle, opened in 2000, allow people tocomplete retirement pension and Minimum Income Guarantee claim forms over the phone withthe help of an operator. To contact Pensions Direct, pensioners dial a local rate phone number. Calls are answered directly by an agent, who deals with the enquiry. Callers can ask the agent to note their change ofcircumstances or answer a general enquiry. The calls are not scripted, but Pensions Direct doprovide aide-memoires to agents to help them respond to common questions. For most queries,callers will need to quote their national insurance number so that the agent can access their recordson departmental databases. A typical call lasts for three minutes. The teleclaims centres operate on a similar system. Callers are answered by agents rather than a call handling system. One important difference is that, when the claim forms are completed, theymust be sent to the caller in the post to be signed and returned. The call centres are open between 07:00 and 19:00. Pensions Direct received 1,065,000 calls in 2001-02, while the retirement teleclaims centre received 430,000 calls and the Minimum Income Guarantee teleclaims centre received 165,000 calls. The principal benefits of the teleclaims centres are that they: !provide assistance at the point of claim !use data that the department already hold, reducing the need for claimants to supply supportingdocumentation !improve the accuracy of claim forms, as the Department for Work and Pensions staff can clarifywhat is required to fill in the form before it is submitted. Before the call centres were opened,40 per cent of retirement pensions claim forms contained errors. In 2001-02, the error rate forclaims completed using the call centre was 7 per cent. The three call centres receive a low number of complaints from customers. Between October 2001 and March 2002, customers recorded 155 complaints regarding the teleclaims centres and 300 complaints regarding Pensions Direct. An evaluation of the Minimum Income Guaranteeteleclaims service in 2001 found that 81 per cent of customers were fairly or totally satisfied withthe service. Fifty three per cent of customers said that they would not have submitted a claim if theyhad not been able to do so by telephone. 45Introduction How do you use the service? AchievementsCASE STUDY E: PENSIONS DIRECT 45 IFF Research Limited, Evaluation of the Minimum Income Guarantee Claim Line (2001).34part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Availability: The busiest period for all three call centres is Monday morning. The department are not able to staff its call centres so that all queries received on Monday mornings can be handledimmediately. It has addressed this problem by operating a call-back system, in which an agentanswers the call and calls back the customer at an agreed time later in the week to deal with theirquery. Despite adopting practices such as call-back, the call centres are not able to answer all thecalls received. For example, in 2001-02, both Pensions Direct and the pensions teleclaims servicedid not answer 6 per cent of calls. For Pensions Direct, only 58 per cent of calls were answeredwithin 30 seconds compared with a target of 90 per cent. Use of appropriate language and tone: Pensions Direct operators receive 13 weeks of initial training. The training includes both information about pensions issues and skills in handling calls. Calls aremonitored regularly to ensure that staff are offering clear and accurate information to customers. TheDepartment are seeking to refine their selection procedures and training of operators to focus onqualities such as empathy, patience and clear explanation of sometimes complex matters. Callers with special needs: Pensions Direct often receives calls from third parties acting for people who do not speak English or with medical conditions that prevent them from using the telephone.The Department do offer facilities for speaking to callers in languages other than English, but thisis seldom used. Similarly, the Minicom system for deaf customers receives only around six callsper month. Cost: In April 2002, Pensions Direct call charges were reduced from the national rate to the local rate. Customer expectations: Some callers do not realise that Pensions Direct provides a service specifically for the five million pensioners who receive their pensions via their bank accounts. Thecentre will respond to queries from people who collect their pensions from the Post Office, but maynot be able to deal with queries that require them to access detailed records. The centre has alsoadjusted to customer expectations that Pensions Direct is a general enquiry service. When thecentre opened, its principal aim was to offer a quick service for recording changes ofcircumstances. Only 25 per cent of calls were more general queries. Currently, around 55 per centof calls are general queries. Creating awareness: Pensioners who receive their pensions via their bank accounts receive an annual statement and newsletter from the department. These materials quote the telephone numberfor Pensions Direct. Customers can also find the number at their local departmental office, at thePost Office and at Citizens Advice Bureaux. The Department use awareness campaigns throughbodies such as city councils to boost usage of the Minimum Income Guarantee.Overcoming barriers CASE STUDY E: PENSIONS DIRECT (continued)35 part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE The success of all these initiatives depends on how the benefits arepromoted and what is being offered (a) Advertising and promotional activities 2.31 Whether older people decide to make use of e-services will depend to a large extent on how the benefits arepromoted. The Office of the e-Envoy and otherdepartments and agencies are actively seeking to raiseawareness of the opportunities provided by newtechnology in general, and of government services inparticular, through: !departmental advertising: Departments and agencies spent considerable sums raising awareness of their e-services in 2001-02. Twenty-one out of the 71 departments and agencies surveyed by theNational Audit Office confirmed relevant advertisingexpenditure totalling \u00a313.9 million (with a further 12 being unable to determine what proportion of theiradvertising was spent on promoting e-services); and !advertising and other promotional activities aimedspecifically at older people: The Office of the e-Envoy supplied articles to targeted publications,such as Saga and Woman's Weekly magazines, andalso worked jointly with Age Concern and AbbeyNational in November 2001 to provide free internet'taster' sessions at 25 centres for the over-50s. LocalAge Concerns and Abbey National branchesdisplayed flyers and around 1,500 older peopleattended open days at the centres to access theinternet and receive help and guidance fromvolunteers and trainers. 2.32 A television and press advertising campaign for UK online took place in November 2001 costing \u00a32.3 million. The campaign involved national televisionadvertising, a printed information pack, a campaignwebsite and setting up a contact centre to handleassociated public enquiries. A subsequent evaluationfound awareness of the UK online brand had risen.When asked if they had heard of UK online, 40 per centof respondents confirmed they had, compared to 24 per cent before the campaign. However, few coulddescribe its role, and awareness of UK online waslowest among people over 55. Future marketing activityis planned specifically to target older audiences. In2003 the government will launch the 'Online Nation'campaign designed to increase awareness of electronicservices, particularly among socially excluded groups,and encourage more people to use the internet. 2.33 The Office of the e-Envoy have also sought to raise awareness locally by providing articles for localnewspapers, just as The Pension Service has used offlinematerial to promote their website. However, it is up toeach UK online centre to encourage older people to usetheir facilities. This requires effort. For example, aSomerset County Council evaluation on the WiredWedmore initiative (see Figure 21 on page 38) designed to provide internet access for older people and othergroups, established seven success factors that are morewidely applicable. 2.34 These points underline the importance of government being pro-active in encouraging older people and otherexcluded groups. There are many examples of UKonline centres encouraging usage among the targetgroups (Figure 17) , and an initial evaluation in October 2000 found that over 93 per cent of usersagreed that staff were helpful and friendly. However, a survey in April 2002 46found that only 5 per cent of responding managers had shown government e-servicesto all customers, 25 per cent to quite a few, while 50 per cent had rarely shown them to customers. Theremaining 20 per cent had not shown anyone. UKonline centres funded through the CapitalModernisation Fund (Figure 9) must submit a marketingplan in their application, outlining how they plan toattract users. However, the Department for Educationand Skills do not have information on the progress bycentre in implementing these plans. 46 Unpublished research by Hall Aitken Associates.Success factors for promoting internet access for all !

The Department ofHealth sought to site 80 per cent of their kiosks in 'safe'locations, such as chemists, shops and health centres.The other 20 per cent were to be in more innovativelocations, such as cross-channel ferry terminals, caf\u00e9s,tourist offices and other places that attract high volumesof people. More than half the kiosks were sited indeprived areas, although it has proved difficult to sitethe kiosks in innovative locations. Negotiations to sitethe kiosks in Post Offices and in airports provedunsuccessful because of the potential conflict with thePost Office pilot, and the costs required to coverpossible third-party liability claims. 2.36 Our report on NHS Direct (HC610 Session 2001-02) recommended targeting those with lower than averageawareness or usage of the service, including olderpeople. NHS Direct has now set an initial target ofraising awareness and usage among people over 65from around 11 per cent to 20 per cent. 2.37 The Department of Health have tackled this low awareness using a targeted marketing campaign in2002. This included advertising in magazines aimed atolder people, and in regional and local newspapers inareas where a high proportion of the population are ofpension age. The campaign is expected to have cost\u00a3250,000 and will be evaluated by examining the age ofcallers to NHS Direct and by bi-monthly awarenesstesting among the target age group. (b) Making content interesting and usable 2.38 Marketing e-services successfully to older people will also depend on what content is available. Althoughgovernment websites are updated regularly, in ourdiscussions with older people many said they assumedgovernment websites would be dull, and were forinformation, rather than pleasure. Older people aremore likely to use government websites if the content isperceived as interesting and valuable. In 2002, theCommittee of Public Accounts recommended 47that websites should be designed around specific servicesthat cut across organisational boundaries so that peoplecan access all the information they need on differentservices. One option could be an older people's portal(Figure 18) . The Office of the e-Envoy are currently looking at candidates for developing services arounddifferent customer groups, one of which is older people.Examples of initiatives to promote awareness of UK online centres among older people ! Adult Learners Week 2002. A number of UK online centres around the country organised a range ofactivities to celebrate and encourage Silver Surfers(older people who use the internet) and get them usingthe internet. For example, Eston Sports Academy heldan Open Day for the over-50s in Cyber Valley, offeringtasters in basic skills. The Weston centre in Weston-Super-Mare offered free wine, sherry and a raffle to newlearners, many of whom signed up for further courses atthe centre. ! The Silwood Cybercentre in Lewisham. The centre was named the Best UK online centre in London in July 2002 (www.silwoodonline.org.uk). Based on theSilwood Estate, the centre is run by a partnershipincluding London and Quadrant Housing Trust,Lewisham College and the local Silwood SingleRegeneration Budget team. London and QuadrantHousing Trust previously provided computer trainingthrough its Residents Online project. The Trust believeshousing associations are in a unique position to giveolder people the opportunity to use the internet. Thecentre has a computer room with full-time staff to helpand a range of free, structured courses. ! Computer Explorer project. Launched in May 2002, this project aims to provide computer access to olderpeople in rural communities. In conjunction with AgeConcern, Barclays Bank and the Department forEducation and Skills, four buses have been furnishedwith internet-ready computers and on-board staff tobecome mobile UK online centres providing help andtraining. During 2002 the buses toured day centres,community centres residential homes and otherlocations in the West Midlands to introduce olderpeople to the benefits of the internet. 17 47 Improving Public Services through e-Government (PAC 54th Report 2001-02).Making government websites more interesting for older people Older people's portal: A portal enables the user to access relevant information and services from one location andcould be a focus for marketing e-services for older people.There is no government website portal specifically for olderpeople in the United Kingdom, although the UK online portalincludes retirement as one of its life episode events and thewebsite www.info4pensioners.gov.uk provides keyinformation from several departments. The Pension Servicewebsite (www.thepensionservice.gov.uk) provides keyinformation on pensions and is developing as a gateway tobetter signpost pensioners to other services. By contrast, government portals for older people have been established in the United States of America (www.seniors.gov)and Canada (www.seniors.gc.ca). These sites provide a firstpoint of access to all government services and information forolder people, designed with their particular needs andinterests in mind. A government portal for older people is an opportunity toprovide a more interactive service, as well as joining upexisting services.1837 part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Training is an essential element in overcoming the 'digital divide' andneeds to be provided in wayssuitable for older people 2.39 Although providing public access is a significant step towards reducing the 'digital divide', Part 1 alsohighlighted that lack of training and knowledge ofcomputers was a major barrier. Yet, without someincentive, many older people are reluctant to seek out asuitable training course. Our focus groups identified threemain reasons for this: a lack of awareness of the trainingavailable, the perceived cost, and a feeling that theywould be made to look foolish in front of others. TheOffice of the e-Envoy and the Department for Educationand Skills are addressing these needs by improving therange and availability of suitable courses, and providingfunding for people to attend training courses. Similarefforts are under way elsewhere (Figure 19) . 2.40 No single style or type of training is suitable for everyone. Courses to meet all needs are now availablefrom private and voluntary-sector providers. AgeConcern, for example, has some 70 local branchesoffering computer/internet 'tasters' and training, and asmall number of private providers specialise in trainingfor older people. Our discussions with training providersidentified six factors critical to successful training forolder people (Figure 20) . 2.41 Central and local government have offered a range of training programmes and other initiatives to encouragepeople to use the internet. The Individual LearningAccount scheme, established in September 2000,provided funds for entry-level training. It was open to allover the age of 19. Although older people were not one of the target groups, some 20 per cent of those whobooked learning were aged 50 or more. Almost two-thirds of all learning was information andcommunications technology, on which participantswere able to obtain a discount of 80 per cent. Thescheme attracted far more applicants than was expected,but was closed in November 2001 following allegationsof fraud (see NAO report Individual Learning Accounts(HC1235, Session 2001-02)). 2.42 The Committee of Public Accounts examined this report in November 2002. In evidence to the Committee, theDepartment estimated that fraud may amount to over\u00a360 million. Notwithstanding this, in evidence to theEducation and Skills Select Committee, one private ITtraining provider, Hairnet, praised the impact ofIndividual Learning Accounts on older people - theirclient group. They estimated that 70 per cent of theirtrainees would not have engaged in IT training if it hadnot been for the scheme. Although the Departmentremain committed to the principles of the IndividualLearning Account, they have decided to consider howbest to take matters forward within their National SkillsOther countries are seeking to provide information technology training for older people19 European Union. There are no specific initiatives at a European level. However, member states can use European Social Fund money to promote initiatives such as internet training. Initiatives by memberstates include: !Finland. Almost all library staff have attended a network training course since 1996 and since 1999 have regularly held activity days for older people to promote the internet. !The Netherlands. The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport subsidises information technology projects for older people, such as training courses in internet caf\u00e9s and old people's homes. Libraries, community centres and commercial agencies also organise I T courses for older people. !Sweden. The national action plan for the elderly includes IT training activities for older people, such as annual 'senior surfing days' and funding for IT training programmes by non-government organisations.Canada. Veterans Affairs Canada and Industry Canada are working together to provide training courses for older people in how to use the internet and on specific subjects, such as using the internet to seekmedical advice. Six factors critical to successfully training older people 1. Let people learn at their own speed. 2. Offer one-to-one support.3. Hold events in familiar surroundings.4. Provide trainers from the same peer group.5. Adopt a warm and patient approach.6. Recognise that reputation through word of mouth is key to recruiting other older people.2038part twoPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Strategy review of funding for adult learning. The delivery plan, including any recommendations on asuccessor scheme, will be published in June 2003. 2.43 The Cybrarian Project , managed by the Department for Education and Skills, aims to enable people who lackinformation technology skills or confidence, or havephysical or cognitive disabilities, to use the internet. Theproject aims to deliver by 2004 an intuitive personalisedinternet search and support tool that will reformat thecontent of the internet to provide readable, useful andmeaningful results. The main target user groups are olderpeople, the disabled, ethnic minorities, and those withlow basic ICT skills. The project has a developmentbudget of \u00a322.5 million to the end of March 2004 and islooking to secure \u00a312.5 million from the private sector inthe final year. It aims to attract 400,000 users by the endof the first year of operation and 1.2 million by 2008. 2.44 The Government is also funding local authorities to provide services and training for older people. The Officeof the Deputy Prime Minister is supporting twenty-fivepathfinder projects to deliver improved e-services and better access to all groups of people. Nuneaton andBedworth Borough Council, for example, received \u00a31.3 million from the Invest to Save Budget for a 'SilverSurfers' project. The project aims to provide technologytraining and support for older people to access localinternet services to promote independent living. 2.45 Other organisations, including Age Concern, are also running schemes designed to encourage older people touse computers and the internet and to overcome barriers(Figure 21) . Those people with disabilities who rely on additional access technology to use the computereffectively also require appropriate training to ensureproficient use is made of their computer.Examples of initiatives for older people Age Concern has developed a range of national initiatives to increase the availability and take-up of computers and theinternet as a means of delivering services, conqueringisolation, empowering individuals and bringing together thosewith shared interests. Many local Age Concerns offercomputer taster sessions in shops, day centres and offices. In2001, Age Concern venues around the United Kingdom ran'open house' training events and internet demonstrations. Age Concern is working with Microsoft and Barclays BankPlc to provide an outreach service to take computer andinternet training out to older people in day centres, residentialcare homes, and sheltered housing. Hairnet is a computer and internet training initiative for the over 50s. Hairnet offers home-visit training, especially forolder people, who want to learn how IT could be useful,exciting and empowering in their lives. Hairnet also offershigh-quality, flexible training and consultancy services tocorporate clients and delivers lectures and workshops to arange of non-profit groups. More than 7,000 people havenow been trained. Hairnet has also built a communitywebsite aimed at and run by the over 50s. Wired Wedmore and 'IT for the Terrified' are local initiatives in the village of Wedmore in Somerset. 'IT for the Terrified' isa training initiative designed to offer the residents ofWedmore and the surrounding area an introduction to usinga computer. The scheme, which focuses on older people, hasmore than 30 trainers, most of whom are over 50, and manyof whom were originally customers. The British Computer Association of the Blind operates a trainer certification scheme that seeks to accredit those whotrain visually impaired computer users in proficient use ofaccess technology.21Part 3PROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Ensuring older people are able to use government e-services 39 part three3.1 Part 2 examined progress in increasing opportunities to access a range of e-services and encourage use by olderpeople. However, as Part 1 outlined, even having gainedaccess or overcome fear of new technology, many olderpeople may still experience barriers to using e-services thatrelate to technical design or how information is presented.For example, those not familiar with the internet may findit difficult to find information if they are unable to navigateeasily round the website. And older people with disabilitiesfind it difficult to access some electronic documents if thewebsite does not allow them to use the specialist softwarethey require. For example, blind or partially sighted peoplerely on a screen reader to read out the text on a page. 3.2 How services are designed is thus of great importance. In this Part, we examine what Government is doing toensure that its own e-services can be used by olderpeople. In particular: !what Government is doing to understand userrequirements; !what standards Government is setting itself on theusability and accessibility of its websites; !how departments' websites match up against bestpractice; and !what consideration is being given to issues ofaccessibility in the development of digital televisionand electronic information kiosks. Government is acting to inform itself about user requirements 3.3 Previous reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts have highlightedthe importance of understanding the needs of users of e-services, developing services likely to offer benefits, andremoving barriers to take-up (Appendix B). This requiresan understanding of specific user groups and their needsand interests. Thirty-eight per cent of the 71 governmentbodies that we surveyed considered older people to beone of a number of target groups for their e-services, anda further fify per cent said they sought to take account oftheir views in developing e-services. 3.4 The Office of the e-Envoy have encouraged departments to use customer-segmentation techniques to identify andcharacterise the main groups of people they serve. Theaim is to understand the preferences of particular groupsof users, and then develop strategies for meeting them. In 2001, the Office of the e-Envoy sponsored workshopsto identify key steps departments could take to carry outthis process (Figure 22) . These have proved valuable, although departments have indicated that they wouldwelcome wider dissemination of information aboutparticular customer groups to avoid duplicating research. 3.5 Our survey found that 86 per cent of departments had attempted to identify the different groups that use theirservices. The Department for Work and Pensions, forexample, identified three main customer segmentsamong current and future pensioners. They found thatmany older customers were comfortable dealing withthe department by telephone, and this influenced thedesign of The Pension Service, when it was establishedin April 2002. 3.6 Departments also seek to understand the views of people once they are using their e-services. Almost allrespondents to our survey sought feedback. The mostcommon techniques were online forms (36 bodies),email (20), and surveys/market research (13). Some 19 respondents said that they had modified theirservices in response to feedback. For example,Ordnance Survey increased the size of the maps theydisplay on their website, the Planning InspectorateKey steps in customer segmentation22 (a) Identify end customers (b) Identify customer needs(c) Segment end customers by identifying common needs and characteristics (d) Join up within the organisation to deliver appropriate services to each segment (e) Identify opportunities for joining up with other organisations with similar customers40part threePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE redesigned the layout and navigation of front pages on their website, and the North West England RegionalDevelopment Agency increased the font size of all texton their website. The e-Envoy expects departments to make their websites accessibleand usable 3.7 Older people will only be interested in e-services if they are easy to use (Figure 23) . Considerable attention has been given in recent years in the United Kingdom andelsewhere to ensuring websites are accessible and usableby people with particular requirements (see Figure 24) . The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), whichcomprises over 500 organisations, including governments,private sector companies, and web users, has been at theforefront of this work. In 1999 it issued specificaccessibility guidelines. Organi sations are not obliged to follow the guidelines, and the Consortium has noauthority to enforce them. However, in the UnitedFocus group participants identified their likes and dislikes in terms of style and presentation23 Participants in our focus groups discussed their likes and dislikes after examining four major government sites - run bythe Department of Health, the Department for Culture, Mediaand Sport, the Department for Work and Pensions, and theNumber 10 Downing Street site. Overall, older users hadsimilar expectations in website design to most other users. In particular: !the content must be interesting and easily found; !home pages should be visually attractive; !the site should be easily navigable, using large headingsand informative pictorial icons; !font size should be at least 14 point; !sites should include appealing and innovative features (forexample, participants liked the opportunity to undertakean electronic tour of Number 10 Downing Street); and !sites should provide reassurance about security andprivacy to offset fears about whether other people canaccess their personal information. Other countries are adopting web accessibility guidelines24 Australia. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission first issued guidance on making websites accessible in 1997. In August 1999 the Attorney General asked the Commission to conductan inquiry into accessibility in the area of e-commerce, which included an audit of the accessibilityof Australian Government websites. Most Commonwealth websites had significant accessibilitybarriers, in particular to vision impaired users. The Commission concluded that agencies should adoptthe W3C guidelines and routinely test the accessibility of their own sites. In March 2000, theGovernment agreed that all Commonwealth departments and agencies should evaluate their websites for compliance with the W3C guidelines and that all websites should pass accessibility testing by December 2000. Many Statesand Territories have developed similar accessibility requirements. In November 2002 the major internet industry associations inAustralia committed themselves to assisting their members to achieve W3C compliance. Canada. In 1998, the Treasury Board Secretariat set up a working group to develop a common look and feel for the internet. The Common Look and Feel standards encapsulate the principles set out by the W3C. European Union. The European Commission's eEurope Action Plan 2002 is a wide-ranging initiative design to speed up and extend the use of the internet. The action plan emphasises that 'public sectorwebsites and their content in Member States and in European Institutions must be designed to beaccessible to ensure that citizens with disabilities can access information and take full advantage of thepotential for e-government'. The plan required adoption of the W3C guidelines by the end of 2001. Areview of progress in July 2001 established: !Denmark. The W3C guidelines had been included in the national guidelines for accessible web design. All web pages on public websites are being checked over a three-year period. User panels, including people with disabilities, take part in the assessme nt of the public websites. There is a national prize for exemplary performance. !Finland. The guidelines were incorporated in the Ministry of the Interior guidance in December 2000. The guidelines emphasise equality of access and that there should be alternatives, such as telephone call centres, to web based public services. !France. The Mission pour les Technologies de l'Information et de la Communication published standards of accessibility for public websites in 1999. !Netherlands. The W3C guidelines were recommended by the Ministry of Public Health, Welfare and Sport in February 2001. !Sweden. A government ordnance issued in September 2001 requires government authorities to ensure that their services are accessible to disabled people. 41 part threePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Kingdom the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requires organisations to ensure that disabled people have accessto services others take for granted. Thus, any governmentservice that is not accessible to everyone riskscontravening this legislation. 3.8 The Office of the e-Envoy have used the W3C guidance to develop their own principles (Figure 25) . The e- Envoy's Guidelines for UK Government Websites (2001)set out the key principles that should underpin allcurrent government websites. Further guidance wasissued in May 2002, which now requires governmentbodies to make all reasonable efforts to comply with theminimum level of the W3C's Web Content AccessibilityInitiative. All new sites and the revisions to existing sitesshould comply, and existing sites should be audited byweb managers. The UK online website conforms to thisguidance, as well as to guidance issued by the RoyalNational Institute of the Blind (Figure 26) . The Office of the e-Envoy promote their site as an exemplar to otherdepartments and agencies (Figure 27 overleaf) .3.9 Departments and agencies are aware of external guidance on accessibility and are making use of it.Many provided us with examples of positive steps theyhad taken to enhance accessibility. For example, OFTELand National Savings had consulted with RNIB onwebsite design, and the Department for Work andPensions are also working with RNIB to improveaccessibility for The Pension Service website. Manyrespondents had used existing software packages toexamine the accessibility of their own website, or hadused Plain English Standards to help ensure theirwebsites were easy to understand. The Department forCulture, Media and Sport commissioned research froma consultancy, HumanITy, on whether websiteinformation could be categorised into no more thannine headings on each web page so that the user couldnavigate using a numeric keypad. The Office of the e-Envoy's key principles (2001)25 The Office of the e-Envoy's guidance sets out ten key principles for departments to follow: !Engaging, accessible, usable. Websites should be user- focused and accessible to all. !Working together. Government websites must work together to join up the government. !Services for the citizen. Government websites must be working together to provide their services online. !Effective content. Users should be able to have a reasonable expectation of the quality, accuracy anduniformity of government content. !Building trust. Government websites must raise citizen confidence by abiding by the law and explaining theirterms and conditions to users. !Listening. Government websites should provide opportunities for users to contact officials, express theirviews or make enquiries. !More than just the Web - multiple access channels.Government websites should operate within a strategythat includes a full range of technology channels. !Is it working? There should be systems for evaluating performance and whether the site meets customer needs. !Can the site be found? Managers should promote the site, develop suitable metadata, and register it withsearch engines. !A well managed service. Government websites should be well managed.Guidance on usability and accessibility of websites26 Key advice from the Royal National Institute of the Blindincludes: !Choose a background that is a single, solid colour. !Ensure that your chosen colour scheme can be over-ridden by the user's browser settings. !Avoid, if possible, the use of graphics in place of actual text. !Ensure that you use relative font sizes in your code, notabsolute font sizes, as some browsers cannot over-rideabsolute font sizes. !Links should contain enough useful information abouttheir destination that they make sense on their own,without surrounding text or graphics. !Moving, blinking and auto-refreshing text is hard to dealwith if you have poor sight. !Don't require users to be able to click on a small ormoving target in order to proceed to another page. !Whenever possible, ask a range of people with various abilities and disabilities to test your pages and give you feedback.42part threePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE The accessibility and usability of government websites is improving,but many do not yet meet bestpractice standards 3.10 To establish whether government websites are accessible and usable by older people and others withparticular needs, we commissioned consultants toexamine 65 government websites using a checklistbased on existing guidance and on advice from AgeConcern. Appendix C lists those we examined, whichwere chosen as belonging to organisations whoseactivities are likely to be of interest to many olderpeople. These included departmental main websites anda selection offering specific information (such as www. pensionguide.gov.uk). While the examination wasnot exhaustive - we scrutinised only a small selection ofpages per website - the results are indicative of thegeneral level of accessibility.3.11 Our audit examined 10 fundamental criteria (Figure 28) . 3.12 Overall, we concluded that many government websites have so far achieved reasonable levels of accessibilitybut there is still more that many bodies can do. Figure 29 identifies the front-runners. Most websites met between four and six of the 10 criteria, although nonecomplied fully (as at July 2002) with W3C standards.Only 25 per cent could be validated using the 'Bobby'software, which our consultants considered severelylimited those government websites accessible to olderpeople with, for example, cognitive difficulties or visualimpairment. In addition, users were expected to visit awide range of sites for different tasks, yet there wasconsiderable inconsistency in the design andappearance of each site. The UK online website is promoted as an exemplar of accessibility standards27 Source: NAO comments on www.ukonline.gov.ukOptions to improve access are the first thing a text reader would identify on the home page All government websites should display clearly the UK online logo The search facility is easyto find on the home page A-Z listings are a useful way of finding information quickly and easilyRegistering with UK online enablesthe user to specify preferences Navigation options are displayed clearly The text is concise, broken up with sufficient space and avoids jargon The website conforms with RNIB requirements The website informs the user that each time they click on an external link it will open a new window 43 part threePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 3.13 The majority of websites reviewed reflect good practice in areas that involve physical appearance, such as clearnavigation and the ability to alter the size of the text(Figure 30) . However, there is room for improvement in ensuring that websites are compatible with text-onlybrowsers. Only 65 per cent could be viewed in this way,meaning that visually impaired people would havedifficulty using the remainder. 3.14 More work is needed in areas beyond physical appearance. Very few websites have implemented theguidance from the e-Envoy on using standard access keys(Figure 30) and many did not have a PICS rating. While 70 per cent used metadata to signal their content to searchengines, only 10 per cent use the type recommended bythe Office of the e-Envoy. These technical matters have animportant bearing on whether people can find and usegovernment websites. For example, the absence of a PICSrating may mean someone visiting a UK online centrewould be unable to access 70 per cent of the websitesincluded in our examination. 3.15 Since we carried out our accessibility audit in the summer of 2002, a number of departments have madeimprovements to their websites to make them moreaccessible, and many others stated that they planned todo so as part of a revision of their site. Six examples ofthese modifications are shown at Figure 31 . In 2002, the Office of the e-Envoy have paid increased attention toaccessibility issues and began working withdepartments to review the accessibility of their sites andto discuss actions required to meet existing standards.By August 2002, the Office had examined 19 websites,undertaking spot checks and providing informalfeedback. The aim is to provide constructive criticismand to raise awareness and understanding ofaccessibility issues.Criteria applied for assessing the accessibility of government websites and significance for older users28 Consistency of navigation. Each web page should have consistent navigation to help older people, inexperiencedwith using the internet, recognise what buttons they need toclick to move between pages and for reassurance that theyare still in the same website. PICS rating. The rating refers to a certificate of the suitability of a website. Many public-access computers, such as those inUK online centres, have a filter on their internet browser thatprevents anyone from seeing websites that do not have aPICS rating. Use of metadata. Metadata describes the content of a website. Internet search engines rely on this facility whenusers search for information. Without metadata, older userscould find it difficult to search for information they require. Availability of search facility. Without a search engine, users would find it difficult to find information within a website. Do external links open a new browser? When a website offers a link to another website, clicking on this link shouldcause the new site to open in a separate window. This willemphasise to older people, inexperienced in using theinternet, that they have left the original website. However,RNIB advise that this approach can be confusing for peoplewho use screenreaders or screen magnification software toaccess the internet. Is there a site map? A site map shows the names of all the pages on a website and how they are organised. The facilityis useful to older people using a screen reader or notconfident with using a search engine. Can users alter the font size? Older people might find it difficult to read small text on a screen and so most browsershave a facility to change the font size. However, this facilitydoes not work if the font size is fixed by a website's designer. Are the web pages accessible using a text-only browser? Older people might use a text-only browser to view a web pageas it omits graphics. This speeds up the time taken to open thepage and makes it easier for screen readers to read out the textfor the visually impaired. If the website is incompatible with atext-only browser, the results are difficult to understand. Does the site use Government Standard Access Keys? Older users who have difficulty using a computer mouse may preferto use shortcut keys on their keyboard to move around awebsite. The access keys should be consistent betweengovernment websites for ease of use. Do all pages pass Bobby validation? Bobby is a software programme that checks a website's compliance with many,but not all, of the World Wide Web Consortium'saccessibility guidelines. Although it is not a comprehensivetool, if the website cannot be validated using Bobby, olderpeople are likely to find it difficult to use it. Performance of government websites against accessibility criteria during July 200229 Front-runners : twenty-two websites met seven or more of the ten criteria. In this category were: The British Library, the Cabinet Office's www.civilservice-pensions.gov.uk, Department for Work andPensions' www.thepensionservice.gov.uk,www.disability.gov.uk and www.dwp.gov.uk, Department forEducation and Skills, Equal Opportunities Commission,Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Highways Agency, HM Customs and Excise, HM Treasury, IndependentTelevision Commission, Land Registry, NHS Pensions Agency,Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Office of the e-Envoy,Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, Office of Fair Trading,Office of Telecommunications, Planning Inspectorate, PublicRecord Office and UK online. The remaining 43 websites listed at Appendix C met six or fewer of the ten criteria44part threePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 3.16 The varied performance on accessibility of central government websites is matched by those at localgovernment level. In their 2001 report 48, the Society of Information Technology Management (SOCITM) foundthat standards of accessibility of local governmentwebsites had improved significantly since 2000. Seventy per cent of websites provided a reasonable levelof accessibility, for example, for the visually impaired,although only one-quarter were rated satisfactory whenwider measures of accessibility were applied. In 2002,the Royal National Institute of the Blind - assessing thesites on behalf of SOCITM 49- rated 40 per cent as very good and demonstrating a sound understanding of therequirements of visitors with special needs. Nevertheless,there was scope for continuing development. 3.17 The private sector has, to date, generally lagged behind the public sector. However, there are notable exceptions.Tesco Plc has recognised the importance of accessibility,and identified a strong business case for developing analternative online shopping service that could beaccessed by people with visual impairment (Figure 32) . The British Bankers' Association has also worked withthe Royal National Institute of the Blind and banks todevelop guidelines for the banking industry, which werepublished in 2001.Accessibility of government websites30 Do all pages pass Bobby validation?Does the site use Government standard access keys?Are the home page and search results accessible using a text only browser?Can the font size be changed by the user?Is there a site map?Do external links open in a new browser?Is there a search facility on the site?Does site use metadata?Does site have a PICS rating?Is navigation consistent? 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0 Yes (per cent) Source: National Audit Office Examples of developments in websites since our July 2002 audit31 !The Police Complaints Authority are currently seeking a PICS rating , allowing access from public libraries andschools, and are incorporating metadata into the site.

(2002).45 part threePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Initiatives for third parties to access e-services on behalf of older people are still at an earlystage of development 3.18 Existing government websites might be more accessible if older people were able to use a third party to act as anintermediary. Such an approach would enable the personto discuss an issue, such as filling in a benefit claim form,with a suitably skilled person who could advise them ontheir approach and had Government authority to fill indetails online on their behalf. The Office of the e-Envoy is encouraging departments to use intermediaries in order toextend the reach of e-services. 3.19 Eleven of the departments and agencies that responded to our survey regard intermediaries as one of the mostimportant means of delivering e-services. Progress hasbeen slow, however, because departments continue tohave concerns about security, the quality of adviceprovided by third parties and whether there are suitableorganisations with a national IT network capable ofdelivering such a service. 3.20 The 'Citizens Connect' project is at the forefront of initiatives to provide third party access to government e-services. The project aims to improve access by usingCitizens Advice Bureaux staff to act as intermediaries. TheNational Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux hasreceived \u00a320 million from the Capital ModernisationFund to develop a national IT network to enable bureauxstaff to access government e-services on behalf of itscustomers. Nine 'showcase' bureaux will pilot the systemin Spring 2003 in order to determine demand for such aservice and staff training requirements. Wider roll-out inearly 2004 will depend on whether the 2,000 bureaux inEngland and Wales want to take up the service. TheNational Association invited all bureaux to commit to the project and by the end of September over 100,representing around 170 separate sites, had enrolled. The development of digital television raises a number ofdifferent issues for Government 3.21 Television is often an essential source of information, entertainment and education for older people, includingthose with disabilities or those who are less mobile. TheGovernment's Digital Television Action Plan, developedby the Department of Trade and Industry and Departmentfor Culture, Media and Sport, in partnership with publicand private sector stakeholders, was agreed in January2002. It emphasises that the technical and social scale ofpreparation for digital switchover should not beunderestimated. As part of the Plan, the Government isconsidering the specific equipment needs of disabledpeople, and their funding, in conjunction with non-governmental organisations, charities, the Department ofTrade and Industry, the Department for Culture, Mediaand Sport, and the Department for Work and Pensions. Itis also undertaking research into the human issues raisedby digital television, including access for disabledpeople and examining means to promote inclusivedesign and usability. 3.22 Delivery of information and interactive services via digital television services is still developing. Technicalconstraints on some methods of providing digitaltelevision, such as band width restrictions on terrestrialTesco Plc has developed an online shopping service accessible to disabled people32 Figure 32 shows the standard Tesco site and the more accessible site. Following a RNIB assessment of its online shopping service,Tesco plc launched a new Tesco.com Access website in April 2001. Key features included a simple navigation system,compatibility with text browsers, rapid download speeds, andtesting to ensure that users can complete transactions quickly.Few graphics are used and there is a very disciplined andfunctional page structure. Tesco plc were the first recipients ofthe RNIB's 'See it Right' Accessible Website symbol, whichsignifies that RNIB have checked the site within the past year andfound it to be accessible. Tesco saw a strong business case for thedecision to establish the simpler site. An estimated 1.9 millionvisually-impaired adults can potentially use the site. If every onebought just one average trolley-full (\u00a385) that would mean over\u00a3161 million of business. Developing the site cost \u00a335,000.46part threePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE digital broadcasts, limit the range of services that can be provided. While digital television has the capabilityto provide additional services for viewers with sensoryand physical impairments, much remains to be done.For example: !enabling people to follow programmes: many older people with a visual impairment use a television tolisten to their favourite programmes. Digitaltelevision broadcasters could provide an audiodescription with each programme to describe events,situations or facial expressions that the visuallyimpaired or those with cognitive difficulties mightmiss. The Broadcasting Act 1996 set a target that 10 per cent of digital terrestrial programmes shouldhave such an option within ten years. However,receiving the service requires a technicalmodification to users' existing digital decoders. Somenewer products offer an audio description module asan optional extra. The Communications Bill proposesto extend the requirements on digital terrestrialtelevision to digital satellite and cable broadcasters. !allowing visually impaired people to follow on -screen instructions: digital television uses a remote control handset and on-screen instructions forselecting programmes and using internet services.Research by the Royal National Institute of the Blindhas established that more than one-third of peoplewith sight problems cannot read television captions,and a further one-third find it very difficult. Digitaltelevision broadcasters do not yet provide an optionto change the text size or provide a screen readerthat reads the text on the screen, although some arebeginning to offer on-screen programme guides andsubtitles in larger type. !providing subtitles for the deaf: 40 per cent of people registered as deaf are 65 or over. There are 1 million deaf and hard of hearing people whodepend on subtitles to watch television and a further5 million who use them regularly. While sub-titles arealready available on teletext for most programmeson analogue television, further progress is needed toincrease the number of programmes on digitaltelevision offering subtitles. The CommunicationsBill will extend current requirements for digitalterrestrial television broadcasters to provide subtitleson 80 per cent of programmes within ten years todigital satellite and cable broadcasters. 3.23 There are no universally accepted standards on accessibility for digital television that can compare withinternet guidelines such as the World Wide WebConsortium's Web Content Accessibility Initiative. TheIndependent Television Commission have publishedguidance on access for deaf and partially sightedpeople 50, but this deals with subtitling and signing to accompany television programmes. The Commission,working in partnership with the Design Council and the Consumers Association, also run the Easy TV initiative,to promote inclusive design and ease of use, to enablemore people to enjoy the benefits of digital televisionand interactive services. 3.24 Some accessibility issues are common to both technologies, and good practices in design and usabilityare applicable to digital television as well asgovernment websites. For example, both media workbest when information is clearly presented, and easy tonavigate. However, it is important for service providersto be aware of the particular strengths and weaknessesof the digital television format. 3.25 It is early days for government services via digital television, and consideration is being given, throughpiloting, to usability and accessibility issues. It may notbe financially viable to provide government e-serviceson every digital television service. The Department for Work and Pensions tested the design of The Pension Service digital television service prior to launching thepilot. Users felt that the service was simple to use, butwere concerned that it was slow and unreliable. TheDepartment made changes to the design in response tocomments. For example, they made the navigationsystem more consistent and changed the language usedto make it easier to understand. They also found itimpossible to broadcast certain claim forms because ofthe limited number of legible words per page. TheDepartment are looking to develop the accessibility ofthe service by using videos to convey audio as well asvisual information, although for technical reasons this isnot available via cable. 3.26 Serco Usability Services tested the usability of NHS Direct digital television pilots and have learned a number of lessons (Figure 33) . Users found the services were generally easy to use, but older users reportedmore difficulty. 3.27 The Office of the e-Envoy have not yet tested the accessibility of the UK online digital television service. The Office have recently sought accessibility advice fromRNIB, who are currently preparing an accessibilitychecklist. The Office of the e-Envoy do solicit feedbackfrom UK online users, but insufficient comments havebeen received to draw firm conclusions aboutaccessibility. Comments range from praise that theservice is easy to use to criticisms that more use could bemade of audio and video content. Users also note that inmany cases the digital television service directs them toa telephone hotline for further information, and so usersfeel that it is not, therefore, truly interactive. 50 For example, ITC Code on Subtitling, Signing and Audio Description.47 part threePROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Information kiosks have generally been seen as accessible by older people 3.28 As described in Part 2, electronic information kiosks offer another alternative that may be suitable for many whoare uncomfortable with that computers. Usually seen assimple to use, they are being developed by a range oforganisations, although, as with digital television, thereare no standards on accessibility to compare with thosefor websites. However, the Royal National Institute of theBlind and Moorfields Eye Hospital in London havedeveloped their own guidance on: !physical location : where possible, there should be a continuous accessible path of travel for a wheelchairfrom car parking places to the kiosk. The floorsurface around the kiosk should be level, and anylabels on the machine should be at a suitable heightand in a clear legible font;!the touch-screen : the screen should be easy to see and away from direct sunlight. It should be viewablefrom the eye level of a person in a wheelchair andpeople with low access should be able to put theirface close to the screen. Text should be in a largefont size and icons as large as possible and spacedout to help elderly people with hand tremors totouch the correct part of the screen; !using the kiosk : few people are trained to use kiosks so it is important there are clear instructions and thatall text is concise and written in simple sentences.Numeric keypads should be large enough to use.Keys should be marked with text to support colourcoding in case the user is colour blind. 3.29 As part of their tendering process, the Department of Health invited leading experts from Age Concern, RNIB,Community Health Councils and wheelchair users totest the different prototypes. Representatives of targetgroups also provided user testing at prototype stage. Asa consequence, the selected model was accessible towheelchair users and had a large screen size. 3.30 The Post Office touch-screen kiosks were designed to allow members of the public to access over 9,000 pagesof government information and to search interactively forjobs and local services. The touch-screen displayedinformation supplied from a number of governmentwebsites redesigned to ensure consistent branding andnavigation. The kiosks appealed to a wide customergroup, with one-third of users aged over 55. Consumerdiscussion groups held as part of the evaluationconfirmed that touch-screen kiosks did help older peopleto overcome their fears of the internet. The informationwas presented in a more user friendly way than websites,although the evaluation report conceded that thisrequired a significant investment of time and resourcesby designers. Eighty seven per cent of users were satisfiedthat the service was easy to use, and 83 per cent weresatisfied with the way the information was presented. Best practice in providing accessible digital television services 33 !Design to the qualities of the medium (e.g. video works better than text on television, but can be distracting) !Use appropriate colours and text size !Use plain English !Adopt consistent navigation (numbers and arrows havetheir own strengths, but can cause difficulty whencombined) and ensure that navigation is where peopleexpect it to be !Keep the number of menus per screen to a minimum !Design for the majority who do not have a televisionkeyboard !If you use numbers in a menu, people will think that youcan reach that choice by pressing that number on theirremote control !Avoid using internet terms like peoplemight understand Source: Serco Usability Services48appendix aPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 1 We adopted a variety of methods to collect evidence to examine government progress in developing e-services for older people and to identify what more needs to be done in future. The methods were chosen in order to: !identify the barriers to take-up of e-services for older people and other low user groups; !explore the impacts of the development of e-services for older people and other disadvantaged groups; !examine how successful government has been in overcoming these barriers to take-up of e-services generally, as wellas government e-services; and !assess the success of Government in ensuring the accessibility of their websites and obtain examples of good practice. Literature review 2 We reviewed literature on the take-up of e-services for older people; reasons for the digital divide; evaluations of government e-services in the United Kingdom; and guidelines on designing accessible e-services. We also reviewed strategydocuments and guidance issued by the Office of the e-Envoy and other government departments, together with literatureon e-services in other countries. Direct references to the literature are noted in the text of our report. Quantitative survey of departments, agencies and non-departmental public bodies 3 We carried out a self-completion survey of 100 central government departments and agencies whose activities we judged could reasonably be expected to be of interest to older people. The survey gathered information on how organisationsresearch customer needs, provide e-services for older people, overcome barriers to accessibility, and promote take-up of e-services. In particular, we asked how organisations: !provide e-services for older people, including the extent to which existing services meet customer requirements and themethods used to obtain feedback on existing services; !overcome barriers to accessibility, such as taking account of users with visual and hearing difficulties or low levels ofliteracy; and !promote take-up of e-services by encouraging older people to use them. A total of 71 organisations responded to the survey. Focus groups of older people 4 We commissioned the consultants BMRB to carry out a series of six focus groups of older people to discover their attitudes to e-services. The focus groups, comprised a combination of regular internet users and people who had limited or noexperience of using the internet. All groups were exposed to four typical government websites in order to stimulatediscussion of what qualities they would look for in a government website. 5 The six discussion groups were constructed to reflect the following criteria - age (50-65 and 66+); gender; social mix (BC1 and - between 'regular users' and infrequent/non-users, according to the answersparticipants gave to questions presented during the recruitment process. The focus groups were held in Birmingham (city),Doncaster (urban) and Devon (semi-rural).Appendix AMethodologyPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 49appendix a6 The focus group discussions were held in facilities where internet access was available. Lasting around 90 minutes, the discussion sessions were facilitated using a topic guide and included a half hour 'accompanied surf' of four UKgovernment websites. 7 In addition, we hosted two on-line discussions with older people who use the Age Concern discussion site. We sought their views on barriers to using new technology, how they used their computers and the internet, and what they thoughtof existing government websites. Audit of central government websites 8 We commissioned consultants The Team to audit 65 government websites using a checklist designed to assess their accessibility (see Appendix C).The checklist was based on guidance issued by the Office of the e-Envoy, together withadvice from Age Concern and The Team. Case studies 9 We looked in detail at progress with specific departmental and other initiatives that aim to make e-services more accessible. The initiatives comprised: Training and access to e-services: UK online centres Hairnet, Wired Wedmore Reaching older people using the internet: Department for Work and Pensions websitesUsing new media to reach excluded groups: NHS Direct electronic information kiosks NHS Direct digital TVDepartment for Work and Pensions digital TVPensions Direct call centres For each case study, we examined the aims of the initiative, what has been achieved to date, and how obstacles to accessibility have been addressed. Consultation with the Office of the e-Envoy, other government departments and other organisations 10 We consulted with the Office of the e-Envoy, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Education and Skills, the Department of Health and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport on a range of issues. This involvedmeeting with teams responsible for setting policy on accessible e-services and managing specific initiatives. 11 Beyond central government, we consulted with voluntary organisations, local authorities and private companies, both to gain advice on designing accessible e-services and to identify case examples that illustrate how e-services can be used ininnovative ways. Organisations that contributed to our knowledge include Tesco, Standard Life, the Welland Partnership,Anite, Hairnet, StartHere, Citizens Online, humanITy, the Society of Information Technology Managers, McCarthy & Stone,Age Concern, Government Offices of the Regions and the Royal National Institute of the Blind. We also visited the WiredWedmore initiative in Wedmore, Somerset to learn more about community initiatives. Overseas benchmarking 12 In order to draw on experience in other countries, we reviewed existing research and visited government and voluntary sector organisations in Australia, Canada, the European Commission, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UnitedStates of America. Consultation with a reference panel 13 We organised a reference panel to comment on both our methodology and our emerging findings. In addition to representatives of the Office of the e-Envoy and the Department of Work and Pensions, the members of the panel were: John Fisher Chief Executive, Citizens Online - a charity committed to exploring the impact of the internet and promoting universal access. Sarah Hamilton-Fairley Chief Executive, StartHere - a charity that has designed and marketed an information kiosk that is being piloted by the Scottish Executive. Emma Aldridge Age Concern - responsible for leading work to improve older people's ability to use e-services, and to develop training and education for them. As part of this, she is involvedin working with Microsoft and Barclays Bank Plc to develop Age Concern internetaccess/learning points. Julie Howell Campaigns Officer, RNIB - worked with Tesco to create an accessible interface for the company's online shopping service, which was launched in 2001, and is working with anumber of online banks in developing similar sites. Helped draft the Government's webdesign guidelines. Emma Solomon Director, Hairnet - Co-founder of a private-sector training organisation providing one-to- one IT training for older people.

All government sector agenciesshould put in place appropriate management information to monitor regularly usage of their websites and e-services. Better public services through e-government (HC704, Session 2001-02) The Office of the e-Envoy should accelerate the dissemination and adoption of good practice by departments on how toencourage citizens to take-up services available on-line. If sufficient numbers do not do so, the considerable potentialimprovements in departments' efficiency will not be achieved. Departments should set realistic take-up targets for servicessupported by action plans to achieve them, marketing key services delivered on-line to specific user groups and developingincentives for them to take-up the services. Departments need to work together more closely to develop more integrated e-services for client groups such as the elderly. e-Revenue (HC492, Session 2001-02) Encouraging take-up is not straightforward and persuading the public to use a new service takes time. This means consulting thepublic and other key customers to identify: what they require from the e-service; what would encourage them to use it; theirconcerns; and, wherever possible and cost effective, to make sure the product meets them. Each new service needs to offeradditional benefits to persuade potential customers to use it. Benefits might include a more convenient and easy to use service , being able to complete a transaction more quickly, being able to rely on the e-service to pass relevant information on to othergovernment organisations, or a cash saving. Building on the research into customer views and needs, each e-service should offerappropriate benefits and these should be highlighted when marketing the service. NHS Direct in England (HC505, Session 2001-02) To build on its initial success in take-up and customer service, NHS Direct should target effort at both a national and local l evel to reach those groups with lower than average awareness and/or usage of NHS Direct - younger people, older people, ethnicminority groups and less advantaged social groups.52appendix bPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Reports by the Committee of Public Accounts NHS Direct in England (HC610 40th Report 2001- 02) Government on the Web (HC331, 23rd Report 1999-00)PAC concern Awareness of NHS Direct remains too low among some groups within the population, including ethnic minorities.PAC recommendation By the end of 2002 all NHS Direct sites should be aware of the patterns of ethnic minority habitation and social deprivation within their catchment areas, and havedevised specific initiatives to encourage the use of the service by these groups. PAC concern Not all citizens will have access to information technology or have the skills to use it, and somecitizens will prefer more traditional face to facecommunications or written correspondence withdepartments. It is important that, as moregovernment services are delivered electronically,these citizens are not excluded from the benefitswhich government on the Web makes possible. We are surprised that the Cabinet Office, with their lead responsibility for promoting government onthe web, did not know how many departments andagencies have a website and whether they meettheir good practice guidance, including beingeasily accessible by members of the public. Citizens are unlikely to access services electronically if the process is complex and time consuming.PAC recommendation The Cabinet Office and departments need to remain alert to this risk so that some citizens do not become disadvantaged in their dealings with Government. We emphasise the importance of the Cabinet Office having more reliable information on the existence and quality of government websites so that they can target theirefforts in promoting good practice. To avoid this, departments will have to look for ways for simplifying and streamlining their systems and forms where practicable so that citizens see a real advantage inaccessing government services online. We expect departments to give sufficient attentionto this as they explore ways of making more services available through their websites. PROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 53appendix cAppendix CAccessibility audit of government websites 1 In December 1999, the UK Government published web accessibility guidelines which were subsequently revised in May 2002. The criteria of the audit that The Team undertook are based on these guidelines to provide a measure of howgovernment websites are meeting accessibility requirements. 2 To test the accessibility of the 65 websites, The Team carried out a range of tasks in a range of different browsers and versi ons of Internet Explorer and Netscape. Ten key indicators (see below) were selected to give an accessibility ranking for each site.The websites tested generally met an acceptable level of accessibility, but fell short of an ideal standard in that none passedthe W3C (paragraph 3.7-3.8) validation. This apart, the study shows which government websites are taking the initiative todevelop websites that are accessible to the widest possible audience and highlights those sites in need of improvement. 3 Overall, the Government is meeting a reasonable level of accessibility. However, only a small number of departments have fully implemented all the requirements of the guidelines. Some typical issues identified in the audit are: !Range of browsers supported !Government Standard Access Keys Content Selection (PICS) rating !Bobby validation !HTML validation 4 The most commonly used web browsers are Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. People with disabilities such as sight loss use a browser (such as Internet Explorer) in conjunction with a further piece of software, a 'screen-reader', thattransforms text into audible, synthesised speech. The audit identified that not only did sites not work in older versions ofInternet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, they also did not function in a text-only browser. Although the audit did not testa further range of browsers, it did identify problems related to those tested. 5 Government Standard Access Keys : A common misinterpretation of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative guidelines is that they are predominantly for the visually impaired. The scope of the guidelines is to ensure that assistive technologytechniques are able to interpret web pages just as well as standard technologies such as Internet Explorer, and that users areable to view and interact with a website irrespective of disabilities. Standard 'Access Keys' provide a shortcut to navigationlinks so that users do not have to depend on a mouse and are able to navigate with a minimum of effort. To ensure thatusers can depend on a default range of keystrokes for every government website, the guidelines identify a standardallocation of keys for navigating together with access to the web page that provides this information. The audit found thatnearly all the sites tested did not implement the Government Standard Access Keys, thereby excluding potential users. 6A PICS rating , which attaches a label to internet content, was developed to assist parents and teachers to control what children access on the internet using filtering software. The importance of placing a PICS rating on a government websiteis that it enables internet access to be controlled from public-domain computers as well as by families. If a governmentwebsite does not contain a PICS rating, a public-domain computer, such as those found in UK online centres, schools andlibraries, which may have internet filtering software, is unable to view the site because its content is not described and thusaccess is restricted. 7 'Bobby validation' is used to check that a web page will conform to the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative guidelines from a technical perspective. The audit found that very few of the pages tested passed Bobby validation. A typical problem is thatalternate descriptions for images are missing. It should be noted that Bobby is an automated accessibility checker, limitedin scope. It is capable of producing false positive and false negative results, and is incapable of testing anything other thanbasic HTML.54appendix c PROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 8 W3C HTML validation is used to ensure that web pages are created appropriately to enable them to work in a wide range of browsers. The audit found that most of the pages tested did not validate. This raises the issue that the pages will notcorrectly display in all browsers and will take longer to display. Typically, if a web page is created and passes both Bobbyand W3C validation then it can be viewed in a wide range of browsers. 1. Is navigation consistent? 2. Does site have a PICS rating? 3. Does site use metadata? 4. Is there a search facility on the site? 5. Do external links open in a newbrowser? 6. Is there a site map? 7. Can the font size be changed by the user? 8. Are the home page and search resultsaccessible using a text-only browser? 9. Does the site use Government Standard Access Keys? 10. Do all pages pass Bobby validation?Navigation is the technical term for features that allow users to find their way around a website. For example, a website may offer a range of options along the top or side of the page that users can select tomove to another page. Navigation should be designed consistently so that it appears in the same place oneach page, and so that the same phrase is used consistently to refer to any given page in the website. Ifnavigation is not consistent, it will be difficult for new users to find the information they are seeking. A PICS rating is a certificate explaining the suitability of the content of a website for use by children. Internet software can include filters that prevent users from reviewing websites that are rated as being unsuitable forchildren. These filters may be in use at public IT facilities such as libraries, internet caf\u00e9s and UK online centres.If a government website does not have a PICS rating, some users will therefore not be able to view the site. Metadata is information that describes the content of a website. Search engines can use metadata to identify whether websites will contain the information that users are seeking. The Office of the e-Envoy recommendthat government websites use a particular form of metadata known as Dublin Core. This type of metadatahas been developed and propagated by an international community of experts. If metadata is not used,government websites may not be identified when users search for them using search engines. Search facilities help users to find a specific piece of information. The search facility itself should be easy to find, and should return useful results in response to queries. Without good search facilities, users may beunable to find the information they are seeking, which can be off-putting, particularly for new users. Many websites offer links to other websites. The UK online portal, for example, offers users the possibility to move to pages within other departmental websites. It is important that, when users follow these links, thenew website appears in a new browser window. This arrangement makes it easy for the user to move backto the initial website when they have finished exploring the new one. It also makes it clearer that, byfollowing the link, the user is now moving to a new website. A site map is a diagram that shows the names of all the pages within a website and how they are linked together. The site map acts just like the contents page in a book, allowing users to quickly find the section inwhich they are interested. As such, maps usually comprise exclusively text, and may be particularly useful tousers who are navigating using a screen reader, equipment that reads out the text on a web page. Users of websites have varied visual abilities. If the text is too small or too large, it may be hard to read. Most browsers have built-in facilities that allow users to change the size of the text on a web page. This isnot possible if the website design includes 'hard-coded' font size, where the size of the text is pre-set andcannot be changed. People who use screen -readers or older computers may use a text-only browser to view web pages. The text-only browser omits graphics from the display on the screen, making it easier to read the text andallowing pages to download more quickly. It is important that pages such as the home page are compatiblewith such browsers, otherwise some users will not be able to enter and find their way around the website. Users who have difficulty using a computer mouse may prefer to use shortcut keys on their keyboard to move around a website. The Office of the e-Envoy have introduced a set of Government Standard AccessKeys that should be adopted by departments. If all departments offer the same set of access keys, users donot need to learn a new set of shortcuts for every new website they view. Bobby is a piece of software that automatically checks whether a website complies with important elements of accessibility guidelines, such as the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative guidelines. If websites cannot bevalidated using Bobby, they are unlikely to be accessible to a range of users.The ten criteria we used to categorise the accessibility and usability of government websites PROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 55appendix cGovernment Websites audited by The Team Organisation British Library British MuseumCabinet OfficeCabinet OfficeCommission for Racial EqualityCountryside AgencyCourt Culture, Media and SportDepartment for International DevelopmentDepartment for TransportDepartment for Work and PensionsDepartment for Work and PensionsDepartment for Work and PensionsDepartment for Work and PensionsDepartment for Work and PensionsDepartment for Education and SkillsDepartment of Environment, Food and Rural AffairsDepartment of HealthDepartment of and MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE www.landreg.gov.uk www.learndirect.co.ukwww.lsc.gov.ukwww.legalservices.gov.ukwww.lcd.gov.ukwww.met-office.gov.ukwww.mod.ukwww.nationalsavings.co.ukwww.nhsdirect.nhs.ukwww.nhspa.gov.ukwww.opra.co.ukwww.e-Envoy.gov.ukwww.oft.gov.ukwww.ofgem.gov.ukwww.rail-reg.gov.ukwww.oftel.gov.ukwww.odpm.gov.ukwww.ofwat.gov.ukwww.ordnancesurvey.co.ukwww.pensions-ombudsman.org.ukwww.planning-inspectorate.gov.ukwww.pca.gov.ukwww.guardianship.gov.ukwww.pro.gov.ukwww.familyrecords.gov.ukwww.remploy.co.ukwww.ukonline.gov.ukwww.ukpa.gov.ukwww.voa.gov.ukwww.veteransagency.mod.ukLand Registry Learn DirectLearning e-EnvoyOffice of Fair TradingOffice of Gas and Electricity MarketsOffice of Rail RegulatorOffice of TelecommunicationsOffice of the Deputy AgencyPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE 57appendix dAppendix DGlossary Accessibility : A measure of the extent to which services can be used by people with special needs, such as people with disabilities. Bobby : A computer program that reviews web pages to check that they comply with common guidelines on accessibility. Broadband : A transmission medium that can carry signals from multiple independent network carriers on a single cable, by establishing different bandwidth channels. Broadband technology is used to transmit data, voice and video over longdistances. Because many different frequencies can be transmitted simultaneously, more information can be conveyed morequickly than by conventional telephone lines, just as that more traffic can flow on a motorway than a single-lane road. Digital television : Subscription television services that use digital technology to broadcast programmes with better sound and visual quality than traditional analogue services. The services usually include additional television channels andinteractive features such as the ability to send emails using the television set. Dublin Core : see Metadata overleaf. Email : A service that enables people to exchange documents or messages in electronic form. Email systems now mainly operate via the internet. Electronic transactions : In ordinary language, dealings between people and organisations ,such as finding out a piece of information, filling in a form, or making a payment, that take place using the internet and the web. Within Britishgovernment circles, electronic transactions are still often more broadly defined to include in addition to web dealings,systematic dealings by citizens with web-enabled call centres. Home page : The first page of a website which users see, and the central page for directing people to different parts of the site. HTML : HyperText Markup Language, the main language used to create web documents. Information and communication technology (ICT) : The application of computer science to ways of organising and storing information and facilitating its transfer among users. Interaction : A two-way exchange of information or transaction. Internet : A world-wide collection of computer networks sharing common standards and protocols of communication, in particular a common addressing scheme. The World Wide Web is now the main internet application, but there are otherfacilities on it too, such as file-transfer facilities and user groups not operating via the web. Kiosk : A machine sited in a public place that uses touch-screen technology to enable users to search for information that is stored in its memory. It is also possible to equip kiosks with keyboards and connect them to the internet so that users caninteract with the organisation that owns the kiosk. Link: A graphic or piece of text on a web page which refers to another web page on another website. When a user 'clicks' on the link, that page is retrieved and displayed. 'Look and feel' : The general appearance of an organisation's website. A standard 'look and feel' helps users to be aware of which site they are in and gives them assurance that its features will work in a standardised way.58appendix dPROGRESS IN MAKING E-SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL - ENCOURAGING USE BY OLDER PEOPLE Metadata : Secondary data attached (or 'tagged') to electronic documents stored by an organisation, denoting specific information about the document such as its author, subject, contents and date. When electronic documents are tagged inthis way, they can be more easily searched according to specific information categories. There are various metadatastandards. The Office of the e-Envoy recommend that departments use the standard known as Dublin Core metadata. PICS rating : A PICS rating is a certificate explaining the suitability of the content of a website for use by children. Internet software can include filters that can prevent users from receiving websites that are rated as being unsuitable for children.These filters may be in use at public IT facilities. If a government website does not have a PICS rating, some users willtherefore not be able to view the site. Portal : Any well-used gateway to the internet, especially those sites designed to serve as a 'front door' and thus the first page that users see when accessing the web. Portals typically provide large catalogues of other sites, powerful search engines forlocating information, and email facilities or other attractive web services. Search engine : A database of web page extracts that can be queried to find references to a person, subject or topic across the World Wide Web as a whole. Many websites and intranets provide similar but smaller search facilities for findingmaterial on their site alone. Screen reader : Equipment that reads aloud the contents of a web page and can be used by visually impaired people to review the contents of web pages. Take-up : The extent to which government e-services available online are currently used by citizens or customers. Text browser : Software that displays the contents of web page without any graphics. When combined with equipment such as a screen reader, the browser allows visually impaired people to review the contents of web pages. Transactions : A transaction with an agency is an interaction with it. This interaction may be the receipt or dissemination of information, the completion or submission of a form, the sending of a payment, the inspection of an account, or morecomplicated sets of dealings. Visit: Any occasion when a person clicks on to a given website or intranet. 'Unique visits' refers to a distinct person coming to the site: here, first-time users are recorded while repeat users returning to the site for a second or subsequent time are n ot. The Web : the World Wide Web, see below. Web page : A single document on the World Wide Web. Website : A collection of web pages located on a common server and published on the internet by a single organisation or individual. The pages can be accessed by outside users without any special authorisation. World Wide Web : The total collection of graphics and text documents published on websites and inter-connected via the internet through clickable links. "}
