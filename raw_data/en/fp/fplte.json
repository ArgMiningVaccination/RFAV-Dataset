To achieve this goal, many people have used various approaches, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). [This is a crass attempt to equate \"CAM\" with \"healthy behaviors\" without any evidence to support such an association. There is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve health.

To achieve this goal, many people have used various approaches, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). [This is a crass attempt to equate \"CAM\" with \"healthy behaviors\" without any evidence to support such an association. There is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve health. In fact, many \"CAM practitioners denigrate and oppose the proven public health measures such as vaccination and fluoridation, and many advocate dietary practices that are irrational and unhealthy.] Wellness is defined in many different ways, but all agree that it is more than the absence of disease. For some it is the achievement of one's fullest potential, for others it is an integration of body, mind, and spirit. Wellness can include a broad array of activities and interventions that focus on the physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional aspects of one's life. [\"Wellness\" is a marketing term that facilitates the marketing of questionable products and services to healthy people.] Since the publication of Healthy People: The Surgeon General's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in 1979 [1],1 the U.S. Public Health Service has led an initiative to define goals and objectives for the health of the U.S. population and to direct resources for improving the Nation's health. The goals and objectives are updated periodically, along with a progress report on their attainment, and have been published as Healthy People 2000 [2] and 2010 [3].3 Long-range goals and objectives for Healthy People 2020 are currently being developed. [\"CAM\" has contributed nothing unique to these endeavors. Moreover, some \"CAM\" advocates actively oppose some of the goals.] As the Healthy People 2000 and 2010 reports illustrate, approaches to improving health and wellness, preventing illness and disease, and managing disabilities and chronic conditions require the involvement of a wide range of disciplines and social institutions. [\"CAM\" has contributed nothing unique toward these endeavors.] The effectiveness of the health care delivery system in the future will depend upon its ability to make use of all approaches and modalities that provide a sound basis for promoting optimal health. People with better health habits have been shown to survive longer and to postpone and shorten disability [4]. [\"CAM\" has contributed nothing unique to the progress of medical science.] CAM practices such as acupuncture, biofeedback, yoga, massage, and tai chi, as well as certain nutritional and stress reduction practices, may be useful in contributing to the achievement of the nation's health goals and objectives. [This statement is an incredible bare-faced lie. Standard nutrition practices are central to public health goals. The rest of the items contribute nothing.] Helping people achieve a healthy, meaningful, and long life is the fundamental purpose of all health care systems. In the United States, great strides have been made in conquering disease and extending life, and the health care system reflects these remarkable scientific advances. [\"CAM\" has contributed nothing unique to the progress of medical science.] Yet in the quest to conquer illness and disease, national wellness and prevention efforts have been focused primarily on immunizations, disease screening and monitoring (e.g., pap smears blood pressure checks), and services offered in response to an already identified illness or condition (e.g., physical therapy after stroke, nutritional counseling for diabetics). [\"CAM\" has contributed nothing useful and unique to preventive health care.] With some notable exceptions, wellness and health promotion have, for the most part, been left to the initiative and discretion of the individual. [This statement trivializes all of the preventive and public health programs promoted by government, professional, and volunatry organizations.] The Commission believes that it is time for wellness and health promotion to be a national priority and for the role of CAM in these efforts to be explored further. [This falsely assumes that \"CAM\" advocates have something useful to offer.] The concomitant rise of interest in CAM and in wellness and prevention presents many new and exciting opportunities for the health care system. There is evidence that certain CAM practices, when administered by properly trained practitioners, may be beneficial. [Note that they fail to identify a single one.] Evaluating safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to wellness and health promotion activities presents new and exciting areas to explore in the quest to improve health outcomes and quality of life. [This falsely assumes that research into \"CAM\" methods will demonstrate that they can improve public health.] The Role of Safe and Effective CAM Practices and Products in Promoting Wellness and Helping to Achieve the Nation's Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Goals The most recent Federal government report on the health status of the nation, Healthy People 2010, is designed to further two overarching goals: 1) increasing the quality and years of healthy life and 2) eliminating disparities in health. These goals and objectives are the blueprint for the nation's health promotion and disease prevention activities, and they influence data collection, national health policy, and program development and implementation. Healthy People 2010 addresses clinical, behavioral, environmental, and health system issues that affect health, and it emphasizes on health education and changing the health-related behaviors of individuals and communities. The principles that underlie CAM practices are consistent with the two overarching goals of Healthy People 2010. Several CAM practices have shown promise in addressing some of the specific objectives outlined in Healthy People 2010, such as massage therapy to reduce the limited activity caused by chronic low back pain (Objective 2-11), meditation or biofeedback to reduce high blood pressure (Objectives 12-9 through 12-12), and tai chi to increase physical activity and flexibility (Objectives 22-1 through 22-5). These and other CAM practices and products that have been shown to be safe and effective should be evaluated to determine their potential for helping to achieve the nation's health promotion and disease prevention goals and objectives. The Healthy People Consortium, which includes over 600 Federal, state, and national organizations, should form a working group to evaluate the potential impact of safe and effective CAM practices and products on the nation's leading health indicators (physical activity, overweight and obesity, tobacco use, substance abuse, responsible sexual behavior, mental health, injury and violence, environmental quality, immunization, and access to health care). Strategies, including demonstration projects, should be developed to incorporate CAM practices and products found to have potential benefit to address these indicators and promote healthy lifestyles. Wellness and Health Promotion for Children For no other group is the learning and adoption of healthy behaviors and lifestyle choices more important than for children and young people. Although many programs address some of the pressing issues facing American youth, the statistics remain sobering, with unintentional injuries, homicides, and suicides accounting for the majority of deaths between the ages of 1 and 24 [3].3 Serious, chronic conditions are beginning earlier in life, as shown by the recently released The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity.5 This report highlights many of the health issues facing children who are overweight, including heart disease, diabetes, and depression, and states that risk factors for heart disease (e.g., high cholesterol and high blood pressure) occur with increased frequency among overweight children. Numerous reports have cited the dramatic increase of Type II diabetes in children and adolescents in recent years, which is also strongly associated with being overweight [6,7].6,7 Early interventions that promote the development of good health habits and attitudes could help prevent many of the negative behaviors and lifestyle choices that begin early in life. Poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, smoking, suicide, substance abuse, homicide, and depression are a silent epidemic among young people and should be considered a national priority. While many individual programs address these problems, safe and effective CAM principles and practices should be evaluated to determine their potential role in transforming the unhealthy behavior responsible for U.S. youths' dismal health statistics. Those CAM principles and practices that have been shown to be appropriate for children and young people should be included as part of a national effort and involve all sectors of the community, especially the schools. Parents, schools, communities, businesses, influential individuals, and the media should become part of a national campaign to heighten children's interest in and awareness of health issues, including how their behavior affects their life and environment and how they can establish good habits for coping with life's stresses. This effort could be similar to other national initiatives, such as those to increase seat belt use, decrease alcohol consumption when driving, and modify other behaviors that impact on public health. Schools are a particularly important part of any strategy. Schools provide activities and services to promote students' physical, emotional, and social development and they usually require that some form of health education be taught. The teaching of safe and effective CAM practices in schools to improve nutrition, reduce stress, resolve conflicts, and develop healthy lifestyles should be evaluated to determine if it can complement the efforts already under way to improve the health and well-being of young people. School programs are locally designed and implemented, and what works in one community may not work in another. Therefore, it is essential that members of the local community (children, parents, teachers, school boards, and others) be involved in these activities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed guidelines for schools to use to increase physical activity, promote healthy eating, prevent tobacco use and addiction, and prevent HIV infection [14].14 The Health Resources and Services Administration, in conjunction with the American Academy of Pediatrics, is developing guidelines for schools that address comprehensive physical and mental health and safety programs. Other Federal organizations, such as the Department of Agriculture, also produce information to assist schools in promoting health. A public-private working group should be established to evaluate the applicability of safe and effective CAM practices and products to existing guidelines. In addition to representatives from Federal organizations, CAM professionals, and parent and teacher groups should be included, and the guidelines should reflect the cultural diversity in school systems. Innovative programs that are successfully addressing wellness promotion and disease prevention in schools should be identified so that other schools can learn from them and, if appropriate, adapt them for use in developing their own programs. For example, a group of middle schools in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area has developed school nutrition advisory councils to promote the nutritional health of students. This is part of the Teens Eating for Energy and Nutrition at Schools (TEENS) program, which encourages adolescents to adopt good dietary habits to reduce their risk of cancer risk [15].15 Some elementary, middle, and high schools in New York and California are offering yoga classes as part of their health or physical education curricula. The reported benefits include increased concentration, reduced impulsive behavior, and increased self-esteem [16].16 Wellness and Health Promotion in the Workplace Most adults in the United States spend a large part of their lives in the workplace, and employers spend an average of $2,400 per employee for single coverage and $6,900 for family coverage annually.17 Premiums rose an average of 11 percent from 2000 to 2001, with small firms bearing a disproportionate share of that increases [17].17 Data consistently show that high levels of stress, excessive body weight, and multiple risk factors are associated with increased health care costs and absenteeism, and that health promotion programs in the workplace can lower health care and insurance costs and decrease absenteeism [18].18 The Department of Health and Human Service's Division of Federal Occupational Health helps Federal organizations improve the health, safety, and productivity of their workforce. It provides comprehensive medical, nursing, and wellness and fitness services at Federal workplaces around the country and serves more than 300 agencies with 1.6 million employees. Other Federal organizations may offer their employees wellness programs as well. Many health promotion programs in the workplace focus on reducing risk factors for illness by encouraging weight loss, smoking cessation, and stress reduction. Studies have shown that stress reduction techniques such as yoga and meditation are beneficial. Evaluations should be conducted to determine the role of safe and effective CAM practices and products in the workplace, and incentives should be developed to encourage those found to be beneficial. Incentives to include CAM in wellness programs and health coverage will vary with the size of the business. For example, larger companies that negotiate health plans through a union will require a different set of incentives than small companies that may only offer limited or no coverage. Some incentives currently exist but have not been evaluated for their effectiveness. Any additional programs or services will have start-up costs that may deter some companies from offering them. Recommendation 26: The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal agencies and public and private organizations should evaluate CAM practices and products that have been shown to be safe and effective to determine their potential to promote wellness and help achieve the nation's health promotion and disease prevention goals. Demonstration programs should be funded for those determined to have benefit. Actions |26.1.||The Healthy People Consortium should evaluate the role of safe and effective CAM practices and products in addressing the10 leading health indicators and develop strategies, including demonstration programs, to encourage the use of CAM practices and products found to be beneficial in addressing these indicators. [This recommendation incorrectly assumes that there are valid CAM principles and practices that the scientific community is neglecting. CAM advocates attempt to boost their credibility by including diet, nutrition, and exercise within their scope. However, the scientific mainstream has addressed these areas for decades.]| |26.2||Questions on the extent and use of CAM products and practices should be included in national surveys and other assessment tools including the National Health Interview Survey, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Where appropriate, information from these sources should be incorporated into the Healthy People 2020 goals and objectives. [It would be worthwhile to investigate the harmful impact of irrational and unsubstantiated methods. However, surveys that merely assess the \"popularity\" of such methods might make them appear more legitimate.]| |26.3||The Department of Health and Human Services, as part of the Healthy People 2010 initiative, should support the development of a national campaign to teach and encourage behaviors that focus on improving nutrition, promoting exercise, and teaching stress management for all Americans, especially children. This campaign should include safe and effective CAM practices and products where appropriate. [This is a crass attempt to equate \"CAM\" with \"healthy behaviors\" without any evidence to support such an association. There is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children. In fact, many chiropractors, naturopaths and other practitioners denigrate and oppose the proven public health measures of vaccination and fluoridation.]| |26.4||The Federal government, in partnership with public and private organizations, should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to improving nutrition, promoting exercise, and teaching stress management to children. Demonstration programs should be funded for those found to be applicable to children. [As noted in #26.3, there is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children.]| |26.5||The Health Resources and Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Education, and other Federal agencies that develop school health guidelines should evaluate the potential applicability of safe and effective CAM practices and products to these school health guidelines. Those found to have benefits should be included in the guidelines. [As noted in #26.3, there is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children.]| |26.6||Federal agencies, in partnership with the business community, should develop incentives for schools to make lunches and snacks healthful, and to limit the sale \u2014 and eliminate the advertisin \u2014 -of high-fat snacks, soft drinks, and other products that do not contribute to healthy lifestyles. [There are valid reasons to promote good health habits to children, but this activity has nothing to do with \"CAM.\"]| |26.7||The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their potential role in workplace wellness and prevention activities, and include them in Federal workplace wellness and health promotion programs and Federal health coverage plans when appropriate. [There is no reason to believe that this would be better than simply encouraging good health habits that have little or nothing to do with \"CAM.\" \"CAM\" programs that disparage standard care or advocate irrational methods would have a negative impact on the health of federal workers.]| |26.8||Federal agencies, in conjunction with the business community, should develop incentives for employers to include CAM practices and products found to be beneficial in wellness and prevention activities in their workplace wellness programs and health coverage. [There is no reason to believe that this would be better than simply encouraging good health habits that have little or nothing to do with \"CAM.\" \"CAM\" programs that disparage standard care or advocate irrational methods would have a negative impact on the health of federal workers.]| The Role of Safe and Effective CAM Practices and Products in Health Care Delivery Systems and Health-Related Programs to Help Promote Wellness and Health and Prevent Disease Federal/State Programs and Systems The Federal government funds many programs that serve vulnerable populations. Among them are Head Start; Meals on Wheels; Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children; Healthy Mothers/Healthy Babies; the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and programs for people with disabilities. These programs have a direct impact on the health and quality of life of the people they serve and may benefit from a wellness and prevention component that includes safe and effective CAM practices and products. The agencies that administer these programs should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to these programs and fund demonstration programs for those found to be applicable. An example of CAM practices and products that might be considered is teaching children in Head Start programs to breathe deeply as a relaxation technique. The State Children's Health Insurance Program might consider whether chiropractic services would be appropriate for this population, and Meals on Wheels might re-evaluate the type of food being served. Appropriately trained CAM providers should be part of the evaluation and decision-making process. Federally funded health care delivery programs should also evaluate the applicability of CAM wellness and prevention activities into their services. This includes the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has 172 hospitals and more than 500 other health care facilities serving 25 million persons; the Indian Health Service, serving 1.5 million American Indians and Alaskan Natives; community and migrant health centers, serving more than 10 million people who otherwise would not have access to care; maternal and child health programs; and school health programs. Demonstration programs should be funded for those CAM practices and products found to benefit these populations. Public and Private Programs and Systems Much of the research, education, training, services, reimbursement, and information development and dissemination activities of the health care system is directed toward identifying and treating diseases and conditions. Although many hospitals have begun to offer community programs that focus on wellness and prevention, these activities often occur outside the system of primary health care and rely upon consumers' knowing that these activities exist, belief in their potential benefit, ability to pay for them out-of- pocket, and ability to access them. Public and private health care programs and systems should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their role in wellness and prevention activities for individuals and communities. The Department of Health and Human Services should help bring together organizations from the private and public sectors for this purpose and help to develop strategies to promote the use of those found to be beneficial. Representatives of national, state, and local organizations of clinicians, administrators, health plans, pharmacists, nurses, mental health professionals, consumers, and others from hospitals, long-term care facilities, and programs serving the aging, the dying, and those with disabilities or chronic illness should be included with CAM professionals and institutions in this process. Recommendation 27: Federal, State, public, and private health care delivery systems and programs should evaluate CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to programs and services that help promote wellness and health. Demonstration programs should be funded for those determined to be beneficial. Actions |27.1||The Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, and Defense and the Commissioner of the Administration for Children and Families, should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products that contribute to wellness and health and determine their applicability to Federal health systems and programs. [This falsely assumes that many safe and effective \"CAM\" practices and products exist and need special federal promotion to gain recognition.]| |27.2||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should facilitate the bringing together of public and private health care organizations to evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products that contribute to wellness and health and determine their applicability to health systems and programs, especially in the nation's hospitals and long-term care facilities and in programs serving the aging, those with chronic illness, and those at the end of life. [There is no logical reason to believe that adding \"CAM\" services to health systems or programs would make such programs more effective or cost-effective. Before investing in any such research, there should be data showing that such an investment would be worthwhile.]| |27.3||CAM and conventional health professional training programs should consider offering training and educational opportunities for students in self-care and lifestyle decision-making to improve practitioners' health and to enable practitioners to impart this knowledge to their patients or clients. [Conventional training and public health programs already offer this. There is no reason to believe that \"CAM\" practitioners have something additional to offer.]| The Role of Safe and Effective CAM Practices and Products in Wellness and Health Promotion and the Application of CAM Principles and Practices to the Management of Chronic Disease Although a significant percentage of people who use CAM practices and products do so to prevent disease and promote health, more information is needed on how CAM approaches can improve wellness and promote health. A related but largely unexplored area is the application of CAM wellness and prevention practices to the management of chronic disease. CAM principles and practices may be useful not only in preventing some of these diseases and conditions, but also in enhancing recovery and preventing further illness. Increased research in this area will help to determine how CAM principles and practices can best be used to meet the goals of the health care system. The core philosophy and orientation of many CAM systems is to support and stimulate the inherent healing capacities of the individual. For example, Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners focus on maintaining the flow of \"qi\" and \"blood\" to balance \"yin\" and \"yang\" for the maintenance of good health. Ayurvedic medicine emphasizes early detection and balancing of \"doshas\" to prevent disease and pathology. Other CAM modalities, such as chiropractic and naturopathic medicine, seek to enhance the body's natural healing system to prevent, treat, and cure disease. A significant portion of the adult population takes supplements and herbs to maintain health. Although many CAM systems and practitioners emphasize the health-promoting nature of their approaches and interventions, research is needed to determine which ones are or might be useful for improving overall health and preventing disease. A systematic review of research to evaluate CAM approaches to health promotion would help identify promising areas for further research and development. In addition to the Federal government, private organizations such as the Institute of Medicine and the American Public Health Association should provide leadership in this area, including assistance in determining how CAM may contribute to the goals of Healthy People 2010 and the development of Healthy People 2020. Recommendation 28: Research on the role of CAM in wellness and health promotion, the application of CAM principles and practices, and the role of CAM practitioners in the management of chronic disease should be expanded. Actions |28.1||The Department of Health and Human Services should fund demonstration projects to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of comprehensive health promotion programs that include CAM. These studies should include underserved and special populations. [There is no logical reason to believe that offering \"CAM\" services to underserved and special populations will enhance their health.]| |V.||The Federal government and private health organizations should evaluate CAM practices and products that are currently being used for wellness and health promotion to determine their effectiveness and applicability to the management of chronic disease. Funding should be provided for demonstration projects in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and other Federal agencies for those CAM practices and products found to have benefit in the management of chronic disease, end of life such as hospice. [This falsely assumes that many \"CAM\" practices and products can be proven useful to chronically and terminallly ill patients and deserve special funding priority.]| References - U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Public Health Service.

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-nine-hundred-fifty-nine) [Analysis of the Final WHCCAMP Report: Chapter 9](https://quackwatch.org/political-activities/whc/9-2/) In the course of Commission meetings, it became clear that a wide cross-section of the population wants the Federal government to take the lead in integrating safe and effective complementary and alternative health care practices and products into the nation's health care system. Consumers, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and conventional practitioners, and product manufacturers testified about the need for a coordinated Federal effort to achieve this goal. This view is consistent with the findings of other groups as well. At the \"Second Annual Integrative Medicine Industry Leadership Summit,\" held in May 2001, a major recommendation was the establishment of a Federal office of CAM and integrative health care and the selection of an advisory committee to the office [1,2] Similarly, the creation of a ... In the course of Commission meetings, it became clear that a wide cross-section of the population wants the Federal government to take the lead in integrating safe and effective complementary and alternative health care practices and products into the nation's health care system. Consumers, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and conventional practitioners, and product manufacturers testified about the need for a coordinated Federal effort to achieve this goal. This view is consistent with the findings of other groups as well. At the \"Second Annual Integrative Medicine Industry Leadership Summit,\" held in May 2001, a major recommendation was the establishment of a Federal office of CAM and integrative health care and the selection of an advisory committee to the office [1,2] Similarly, the creation of a Federal CAM/integrated health care office was a key recommendation of the \"National Policy Dialogue to Advance Integrated Health Care: Finding Common Ground\" held at Georgetown University in late 2001 [3]. [This paragraph reflects the views of \"CAM\" proponents whose views dominated the events described in this paragraph. It does not reflect \"a wide cross-section\" of theAmerican population, most of whom have never considered the matter.] Proper integration of safe and effective CAM practices and products into the nation's health care system will require an ongoing, coordinated Federal presence. The most effective means of accomplishing this goal is to establish a centralized office that would include the full range of CAM perspectives in the dialogues that guide policy formulation and implementation. Several possible locations of the office were proposed, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. If located in the White House, the new office could be either a freestanding entity in the Executive Office of the President, following the precedent of the Office of National AIDS Policy and the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, or it could be placed in an existing office, such as the Office of Domestic Policy. A White House location would provide an opportunity to influence Federal policy, but it would not provide a permanent presence in the Federal sector. If located in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the office could be created in the Secretary's Office of Public Health and Science (OPHS), following the lead of the Office of Minority Health and the Office on Women's Health, or it could be placed within one of the 13 existing program offices that make up the OPHS-in particular, the Office of the Surgeon General. Locating it under the Surgeon General could provide links to other important public health activities, such as Healthy People 2010. While a DHHS location would provide a permanent Federal presence, it would limit the office's influence mainly to DHHS policy. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is an example of effective Federal coordination of CAM research that evolved from an office established within DHHS. It began as the Office of Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes of Health with a $2 million budget in fiscal year 1992 and became a national research-coordinating center with a $104.6 million budget in fiscal year 2002. [Considering how little it has accomplished, it illustrates why settling up another federal agency to promote \"CAM\" is a poor idea.] The presence and focus of NCCAM in the Federal government has stimulated research well beyond the reach of its budget, with private and public organizations also contributing to increased efforts in CAM research, education, and practice in the United States and around the world. Office of Complementary and Alternative Health Care Coordination Three options for creating an office of complementary and alternative health care coordination are possible. First, the President could establish the office in the White House through an executive order. Second, the Secretary of Health and Human Services could establish the office in OPHS or one of its component program offices by an administrative action. Third, Congress could create the office and determine the most appropriate location through legislation, which would provide permanence, a legislative mandate, and budget appropriations. Responsibilities of the Office - Responsibilities should include the following: - Coordinating Federal CAM activities; - Serving as a Federal CAM policy liaison with conventional health care and CAM professionals, organizations, educational institutions, and commercial ventures; - Planning, facilitating, and convening conferences, workshops, and advisory groups; - Acting as a centralized Federal point of contact for CAM for the public, CAM practitioners, conventional health care providers, and the media; - Facilitating implementation of the recommendations and actions of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy; - Exploring additional and emerging topics not included in the Commission's Executive Order. Coordinating Federal CAM Activities Coordinating Federal CAM activities requires that the office be placed at the highest possible and most appropriate level in the Federal Government. If located in DHHS, the office would work closely with all DHHS Agencies in a manner similar to that of the minority health and women's health offices. For example, the new office would collaborate with NCCAM, the National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health, and other appropriate Federal Departments and Agencies. Once established, the office will need to coordinate CAM activities all Federal CAM activities. It should form a trans-departmental CAM coordinating committee that includes representation from all Federal Departments and Agencies to facilitate its mission. Because the extent of Federal CAM activities has not been identified fully, the office should conduct a baseline survey of activities, by collecting data through the trans-departmental committee. Results of the survey could form the basis for coordinating Federal CAM activities. Because of its value to the Secretary, Administration, and Congress, this type of report on Federal CAM activities could be generated periodically to assist in making ongoing policy decisions. Serving As a Federal CAM Policy Liaison Another significant role of the office would be to serve as a Federal CAM policy liaison with conventional health care and CAM professionals, organizations, educational institutions, and commercial ventures. These activities are described in the recommendations and actions in the Education and Training, Information Development and Dissemination, Wellness, Access and Delivery, Coverage and Reimbursement, and Coordination of Research chapters of this report. An important activity of the new office would be to establish an advisory council similar to NCCAM's. This group should bring together the various parties interested in CAM to develop a strategic plan that reflects public opinion. Therefore, the advisory council should include consumers and other members from outside the Federal government. The membership also should include the directors of NCCAM, the Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and the Office of Dietary Supplements. In addition, it should include representatives from the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Energy, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Food and Drug Administration, the White House Office of Domestic Policy, and other appropriate Federal entities. Planning, Facilitating, and Convening Conferences, Workshops, and Necessary Advisory Groups Public testimony stressed the importance of creating sustainable, collaborative environments in which issues of mutual concern to CAM and conventional health care can be raised, discussed, and resolved. The new office would bring together interested parties from CAM and conventional health care to design and undertake activities to meet the needs identified by the advisory council, the trans-departmental CAM coordinating committee, and the results of the survey of Federal CAM activities. By planning, facilitating, and convening conferences, workshops, and advisory groups, the new office would create unique opportunities to explore CAM issues, such as those involving product safety, licensure, or coverage and reimbursement. Acting as a Centralized Federal Point of Contact for CAM As a centralized Federal point of contact for CAM, the office would develop and implement a system to direct inquiries from the public, CAM practitioners, conventional health care providers, and the media to the appropriate person at the Departmental or Agency level. The office would carry out this responsibility through a network of information officers or other persons with known expertise. To transmit information readily to the public, CAM practitioners, and conventional health care providers, the office should create a website that includes information about the office and its responsibilities, a CAM events calendar, and links to Federal and other appropriate CAM websites. [Whether such information would be useful would depend upon who prepares and provides it. To date, federal agencies that have provided information about \"CAM\" practices have done a very poor job. So far, government-sponsored CAM information sources have been unwilling to identify which CAM methods are worthless and have failed to refer people to information sources that are justifiably critical of CAM methods. Setting up another agency with similar policies would worsen the situation rather than improve it.] Not everyone has access to the Internet, so information must be developed and made readily available to these consumers as well. Since NCCAM has a Congressional mandate \"to establish a clearinghouse to exchange information with the public about alternative medicine,\" the new office should not undertake activities that would duplicate NCCAM's. However, additional information is needed consumes if they are to make informed decisions about CAM. The office would collaborate with Federal Departments and Agencies and the private sector to develop reliable information for dissemination through the NCCAM clearinghouse and other means that are not dependent upon the Internet. [So far, NCCAM has provided almost no information about \"CAM\" that should be avoided. It has never, for example, categorized any \"CAM\" method as irrational.] Facilitating Implementation of Commission Recommendations and Actions Considerable time and resources were spent in soliciting specific recommendations from the public, and this advice helped form the basis of the Commission's recommendations and actions. However, without legislative authority, staff, and a budget, the likelihood of their being successfully implemented is diminished significantly. Therefore, one of the most important roles of the new office is to facilitate implementation of the Commission's recommendations and actions. [In other wrods, to set up an office that can lobby for more special privileges for methods marketed as \"CAM.\"] This role would include interactions with Administration officials, members of Congress and their staffs, and relevant Departments and Agencies. Particularly encouraging is language in the Conference Report that accompanied the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002 (Public Law 107-116), which urged the Secretary of Health and Human Services to form a coordinating unit to review the Commission's report and implement ways of improving coordination of the DHHS's many CAM-related activities. Exploring additional and emerging topics not included in the Commission's Executive Order Despite the comprehensive nature of the Commission's Executive Order, additional and emerging topics beyond the scope of this report will need to be addressed, and the new office would be in a position to do this. For example, the office could provide technical assistance on CAM to individual States when requested. Recommendation 29: The President, Secretary of Health and Human Services, or Congress should create an office to coordinate Federal CAM activities and to facilitate the integration into the nation's health care system of those complementary and alternative health care practices and products determined to be safe and effective. Actions |29.1||The office should be established at the highest possible and most appropriate level in the Department of Health and Human Services and should be given sufficient staff and budget to meet its responsibilities. [It would be absurd to create an \"office at the highest possible level\" to promote so-called CAM. Doing that would constitute a government endorsement of homeopathy, therapeutic touch, cranial osteopathy, rebirthing and many other preposterous practices that have been embraced by one or more members of Commission.]| |29.2||The office should charter an advisory council. Members should include CAM and conventional practitioners with expertise, diverse backgrounds, and necessary training, as well as representatives of both the private and public sectors, to guide and advise the office about its activities. [Previous advisory councils have been composed almost entirely of \"CAM\" advocates and have included few if any knowledgeable critics.]| |29.3||The office's responsibilities should include, but not be limited to, coordinating Federal CAM activities; serving as a Federal CAM policy liaison with conventional health care and CAM professionals, organizations, institutions, and commercial ventures; planning, facilitating, and convening conferences, workshops, and advisory groups; acting as a centralized Federal point of contact regarding CAM for the public, CAM practitioners, conventional health care providers, and the media; facilitating implementation of the Commission's recommendations and actions; and exploring additional and emerging topics not considered by the Commission.| References - Areas of agreement and proposed action among industry stakeholders.

Gorski, MD, FACOG] COORDINATION OF RESEARCH Recommendation 1: Federal agencies should receive increased for clinical, basic, and health services research on CAM. Actions 1.1 Federal agencies should increase their activities with respect to CAM in accordance with their biomedical research, health services research, or other health care-related responsibilities and make these activities, including available technical assistance, known to CAM and conventional researchers and practitioners. Activities might include funding initiatives such as requests for applications and proposals; CAM-focused offices or centers; CAM-focused staff positions; CAM advisory committees or the representation of qualified CAM professionals on such committees.

Gorski, MD, FACOG] COORDINATION OF RESEARCH Recommendation 1: Federal agencies should receive increased for clinical, basic, and health services research on CAM. Actions |1.1||Federal agencies should increase their activities with respect to CAM in accordance with their biomedical research, health services research, or other health care-related responsibilities and make these activities, including available technical assistance, known to CAM and conventional researchers and practitioners. Activities might include funding initiatives such as requests for applications and proposals; CAM-focused offices or centers; CAM-focused staff positions; CAM advisory committees or the representation of qualified CAM professionals on such committees. [Research priorities should depend on the likelihood that projects will yield significant results and not on whether or not they are marketed as \"CAM.\"]| |1.2||Federal agencies should assess the scope of scientific, practice, and public interest and needs regarding CAM that are relative to their missions, examine their portfolios, and develop funding distribution strategies to address these interests and needs. [Since \"public interest\" is not necessarily related to effectiveness, it should not be a major factor in determining research priorities.]| |1.3||The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality together with The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine should develop ways to expand health services research in CAM and explore methodologies for health services research in this area. [NCCAM and its predecessors have produced no significant findings during its ten years of existence. It makes more sense to abolish it than to increase its funding.]| |1.4||The Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support more research on (1) complex compounds/mixtures frequently found in CAM products, (2) clinical interventions consisting of multiple treatments, (3) how patient-practitioner interactions affect treatment outcomes, and (4) individualizing treatments. [Identifying the active ingredients of promising herbs is a worthwhile endeavor that has been taking place for decades. But this recommendation also supports clinical research on crude extracts (chemical mixtures) that is likely to be unproductive. It might also be useful to study patient-practitioner interactions. However, research expenditures and other incentives should be proportional to probable value, not whether something is labeled \"CAM.\"]| |1.5||n order to protect public health and maximize benefits, Congress should provide adequate public funding for research on frequently used or promising CAM products that would be unlikely to receive private research support. [This falsely implies that their are many promising \"CAM\" products. Frequency use should be considered only if a product appears to be effective.]| |1.6||The Federal government should support research on CAM practices that appear to be effective but may not be profitable to private investors, such as biofeedback, meditation, guided imagery, art therapy, and music therapy. [Research priority should be related to the probability of obtaining useful results, not according to whether something is marketed as \"CAM.\"]| Recommendation 2: Congress and the Administration should consider enacting legislative and administrative incentives to stimulate private sector investment in CAM research on products that may not be patentable. Actions |2.1||Incentives to stimulate private sector investment in CAM research should focus on (1) research on dietary supplements and other natural products that may not be patentable; (2) research on other CAM products that may not be patentable, including therapeutic devices; and (3) the development of analytical methods for producing better quality CAM products. [Research priority should be related to the likelihood of useful results and not to whether products are classified as \"CAM.\"| |2.2||The Federal and private sectors should provide support for workshops to discuss the research needed by regulatory agencies for their review and approval processes for CAM products and devices. [This recommendation puts the cart before the horse. CAM advocates do not need special training in how to get things approved. Regulatory approval is based on proof of safety and effectiveness. Whether methods are standard or are labeled \"CAM\" is not relevant. What counts is whether or not they work.]| |2.3||Federal agencies should develop outreach programs to inform manufacturers of CAM products and devices about the Federal research support available to private industry and how the agency can assist them.| Recommendation 3: Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support research on CAM modalities and approaches that are designed to improve self-care and behaviors that promote wellness. [Research priorities should be determined by the likelihood of useful findings and not whether they are identified as \"CAM.\" Proven self-care and wellness strategies are part of mainstream public health and should not be identified as \"CAM.\"] Recommendation 4: Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support new and innovative CAM research on core questions posed by frontier areas of scientific study associated with CAM that might expand our understanding of health and disease. Actions |4.1||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, assisted by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, should develop guidelines for establishing research priorities in CAM . [NCCAM has supposedly been doing this for many years.]| |4.2||The National Science Foundation, in collaboration with The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, should examine frontier areas of science associated with CAM that are outside the current research paradigm and methodological approaches to study them. [This falsely assumes that that \"frontier areas of science associated with CAM\" are rational but cannot be tested by established research methods. This appears to include alleged supernatural forces such as\"electromagnetic energy flow\" that cannot be measured with scientific instruments.]| |4.3||Multidisciplinary workshops and expert panels should be convened by Federal, private and nonprofit organizations, collaboratively or independently, to explore the challenges in design and methodology presented by research questions in CAM areas that are outside the current research paradigm. [The fact that quack methods cannot be substantiated does not mean that science-based standards of evidence should be lowered.]| |4.4||The National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense are among the Federal organizations that should consider contributing collaboratively or independently to the support of research on core questions in areas described in many CAM systems. [This is a blatant pitch for more research funds for studying methods marketed as \"CAM.\" Research dollars should be allocated according to potial usefulness rather than how they are designated.]| |4.5||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, working with the World Health Organization, should examine investigative approaches for studying the traditional systems of medical practice from a variety of cultures. [The study of folk healing is probably not a cost-effective way to discover new methods.]| Recommendation 5: Investigators engaged in research on CAM should ensure that human subjects participating in clinical studies receive the same protections as are required in conventional medical research and to which they are entitled. Actions |5.1||Licensed practitioners using CAM systems and modalities who wish to conduct or collaborate in clinical research should follow the same requirements as in conventional medical research. They should develop, or partner with a research institution to develop, a scientifically valid research protocol and obtain Institutional Review Board approval to ensure that they meet accepted standards of ethical conduct and their responsibilities to protect human subjects. [These are standard operating procedures for scientific research.]| |5.2||Accredited CAM institutions and CAM professional organizations should establish Institutional Review Boards where possible, and guide their colleagues and members to utilize the Institutional Review Board process, which is required to conduct clinical research.| |5.3||Institutional Review Boards that review CAM research studies should include the expertise of qualified CAM professionals in the review.| |5.4||Research institutions, National Institutes of Health Institutes and Centers, and other Federal research and health care agencies should be more proactive in developing programs that (1) provide opportunities for expert review of promising CAM practice-based observational data by experienced researchers, (2) stimulate practitioner response to the opportunities offered by the programs and (3) facilitate communication and stimulate partnerships between CAM practitioners and conventionally-trained researchers in designing and implementing clinical studies.| Recommendation 6: The Commission recommends that state professional regulatory bodies include language in their guidelines stating that licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized practitioners who are engaged in research on CAM will not be sanctioned solely because they are engaged in such research if they: (1) are engaged in well-designed research that is approved by an appropriately constituted Institutional Review Boards, (2) are following the requirements for the protection of human subjects, and (3) are meeting their professional and ethical responsibilities. All CAM and conventional practitioners, whether or not they are engaged in research, must meet whatever State practice requirements or standards govern their authorization to practice. [This proposal, if implemented, would enable practitioners of quack methods to escape rstate egulatory action by setting up their own Institutional Review Boards.] Recommendation 7: Increased efforts should be made to strengthen the emerging dialogue among CAM and conventional medical practitioners, researchers and accredited research institutions; Federal and state research, health care, and regulatory agencies; the private and nonprofit sectors; and the general public. Actions |7.1||CAM and conventional medical researchers and practitioners should adhere to the same high standards of quality and ethics in all aspects of research and related activities. [This is self-evident but exaggerates the likelihood that \"CAM\" researchers and practitioners can achieve high standards of quality and ethics.]| |7.2||Federal agencies should develop programs to stimulate cooperation and partnerships between CAM and conventional medical professionals and accredited institutions. [This exaggerates the likelihood that \"CAM\" practitioners can enter into useful partnerships with science-based practitioners and their institutions.]| |7.3||Committees reviewing or advising on research, journal submissions, regulatory compliance, and health insurance coverage in both the public and private sectors should include as members or consultants trained, experienced, and properly qualified CAM health care professionals. [This falsely implies that many \"properly qualified CAM health professionals\" exist. TMoreover, the choice of experts should be based on the quality of their work rather than how they label and market themselves.]| |7.4||Multidisciplinary conferences, workshops, and expert panels on CAM research and related activities, including research methodology, should be supported independently or collaboratively by the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. [Such intermingling would have political value for \"CAM\" proponents but is unlikely to add to scientific knowledge.]| |7.5||The nonprofit sector and the private sector should create funding partnerships, whether independently or with Federal agencies, to augment support for CAM research, research infrastructure and training, research conferences, and information dissemination. [Nonprofit and private organizations can give money to whomever they please. Allocation of government funds should be based on scientific standards, not how methods are classified.]| |7.6||The Federal government should support research, including population-based research, to learn more about why people use CAM practices and products, how they determine the safety and effectiveness of the practices and products they use, and what they find satisfying or unsatisfying about them. [If done properly, research of this type could be used to educate people on how to avoid being quacked. But the statistics could also be used to promote irrational methods by trumpeting about how popular they are.]| |7.7||To benefit patients and future research protocol development and to add to our knowledge about the use of CAM, Institutional Review Boards should consider requiring that all research subjects be asked about their use of herbal or other dietary supplements. [This might be important if using dietary supplements or herbs could confound the data. But routine questioning might convey an underlying message that the products are so important that they deserve special consideration.]| |7.8||Federal agencies supporting biomedical and health services research should develop orientation and training programs for public representatives to enhance the effectiveness of their participation on advisory committees concerned with CAM. [It does not make sense to train people whose judgment is so poor that they advocate wildly implausible hypotheses.]| Recommendation 8: Public and private resources should be increased to strengthen the infrastructure for CAM research and research training at conventional medical and CAM institutions and to expand the cadre of basic, clinical, and health services researchers who are knowledgeable about CAM and have received rigorous research training. Actions |8.1||Funding should be made available to accredited CAM and conventional medical institutions develop programs that examine CAM research questions and that stimulate cross-institutional collaborations involving faculty and students in research and research training.| |8.2||Funding should be made available to accredited CAM and conventional medical institutions support joint research and professional education and training programs to enhance the quality and clinical relevance of CAM research and link the research with evidence-based education and training of practitioners. [This falsely assumes that training advocates of irrational practices will lead to valuable results. There is no logical reason to assume that it will. Moreover, CAM is a marketing term, not a genuine field of health care.]| |8.3||Federal health agencies with research training programs and responsibilities that encompass CAM-related questions should be given adequate support to increase research training in CAM. [This falsely assumes that training advocates of irrational practices will lead to valuable results. There is no logical reason to assume that it will. Moreover, CAM is a marketing term, not a genuine field of health care.]| |8.4||Existing resources, such as The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine-supported centers and the National Center for Research Resources' General Clinical Research Centers should be utilized to increase opportunities to conduct clinical research and training on CAM and examine the inclusion of CAM into the clinical setting. [Despite nearly ten years of distributing grant money, NCCAM and its predecessors have produced no useful clinical research findings. It makes no sense to increase their funding.]| |8.5||Federal support should be increased for career development awards, including those that enable investigators focusing on CAM to develop into independent investigators and faculty members, and mid-career awards that provide the time required to mentor new CAM investigators. [The basis for training career investigators should be the quality of their work, not whether they label or market themselves as \"CAM\" investigators.]| Recommendation 9: Public and private resources should be used to support, conduct, and update systematic reviews of the peer-reviewed research literature on the safety, efficacy, and cost-benefit of CAM practices and products. Actions |9.1||The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality should expand its Evidence-based Practice Center systematic reviews on CAM systems and treatments for use by private and public entities in developing tools, such as practice guidelines, performance measures, and review criteria, and for identifying future research needs. [This falsely implies that current methods of scientific review are defective and that \"CAM\" methods should be reviewed differently.]| |9.2||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine should issue a comprehensive, understandable, and regularly updated summary of current clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of CAM systems and treatments for health care practitioners and the public. [Many such summaries have been published. Whether more would serve any useful purpose would depend on who compiles them and whether their conclusions are supported by scientific evidence. To date, neither NCCAM nor WHCCAMP has ever publicly concluded that any \"CAM\" method is worthless and should be abandoned. The call for dissemination of \"evidence\" attempts to conceal how little there is that is worth disseminating.]| EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS Recommendation 10: The education and training of CAM and conventional practitioners should be designed to ensure public safety, improve health, and increase the availability of qualified and knowledgeable CAM and conventional practitioners and enhance the collaboration among them. Actions |10.1||Conventional health professional schools, postgraduate training programs, and continuing education programs should develop core curricula of knowledge about CAM to prepare conventional health professionals to discuss CAM with their patients and clients and help them make informed choices about the use of CAM. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |10.2||CAM education and training programs should develop curricula that reflect the fundamental elements of biomedical science and conventional health care relevant to and consistent with the practitioners' scope of practice. [This falsely assumes that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" deserve advocacy in training programs.]| |10.3||CAM and conventional education and training programs should develop curricula and other methods to facilitate communication and foster collaboration between CAM and conventional students, practitioners, researchers, educators, institutions and organizations. [This falsely assumes that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" deserve advocacy in training programs and that the offerings \"CAM\" advocates are likely to be trustworthy.]| |10.4||Increased Federal, state, and private sector support should be made available to expand and evaluate CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at accredited CAM and conventional institutions. [This is a blatant call for promotion of unsubstantiated methods and their advocates throughout our medical educational system. Just the opposite is needed. Science-based accrediting bodies should attack the quackery that that has infiltrated medical education within the past few years.]| |10.5||Expansion of eligibility of CAM students at accredited institutions for existing of loan programs should be explored. [This would help subsidize students at schools of acupuncture and naturopathy whose teachings advocate irrational practices such as homeopathy.]| |10.6||The Department of Health and Human Services should conduct a feasibility study to determine whether appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners enhance and/or expand health care provided by primary care teams.* This feasibility study could lead to demonstration projects to identify: 1) the type of practitioners, 2) their necessary education and training, 3) the appropriate practice settings, and 4) the health outcomes attributable to the addition of these practitioners and services to comprehensive care. [This falsely implies that \"CAM\" advocates have a lot to offer. However, adding ineffective methods to effective ones will increases the cost of health-care delivery but not its quality.]| |10.7||The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal Departments and Agencies should convene conferences of the leaders of CAM, conventional health, public health, evolving health professions, and the public; of educational institutions; and of appropriate organizations to facilitate establishment of CAM education and training guidelines. Subsequently, the guidelines should be made available to the states and professions for their consideration. [This falsely assumes that rational guidelines can be written for teaching irrational methods.]| |10.8||Feasibility studies of postgraduate training for appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners should be conducted to determine the type of practitioners, practice setting, and their impact on clinical competency, quality of health care, and collaboration with conventional providers. [Here WHCCAMP demands that residency training be corrupted by giving CAM advocates free reign to promote their anti-scientific nonsense.]| |10.9||Practitioners who provide CAM services and products should complete appropriate CAM continuing education programs that include critical evaluation of CAM to enhance and protect the public's health and safety. [There is no reason to expect that science-based CAM continuing education programs can be created or that \"CAM\" practitioners would attend such programs or be influenced by them. To be \"appropriate,\" such programs would have to advocate abandonment of \"CAM\" methods that are irrational.| CAM INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT AND DISSEMINATION Recommendation 11: The Federal government should make available accurate, useful, and easily accessible information on CAM practices and products, including information on safety and effectiveness. Actions |11.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should establish a task force to facilitate the development and dissemination of CAM information within the Federal government and to eliminate existing gaps in CAM information. The task force should include consumers, CAM providers, scientists, and conventional health care practitioners. Resources should subsequently be provided to close identified gaps and improve the availability, coordination, and dissemination of information. [The only real gaps in government CAM information are (a) the failure to identify which CAM methods are worthless and (b) the failure of NCCAM and other government agencies to refer people to information sources that are justifiably critical of CAM methods. Setting up more agencies with similar policies would worsen the situation rather than improve it.]| |11.2||Federal Departments and agencies with missions or activities relevant to CAM should 1) develop informational materials about CAM that are easy to understand and use, and 2) support and collaborate with national and local community leaders and CAM leaders and organizations to identify strategies for enhancing the development, availability, and accessibility of information on the safety and effectiveness of CAM practices and products. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |11.3||Increased funding should be provided to the National Library of Medicine and the American Library Association to expand training of librarians to include helping consumers find information on CAM. [This is another way to promote dubious methods. Why should a particular subset of medical literature get special status or attention in libraries merely because it deals with unproven, disproved or irrational therapies? Moreover, it is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |11.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should direct resources to streamline the process of identifying and making available relevant, high-quality CAM information from other countries and in other languages. [This falsely assumes that other countries have high-quality \"CAM\" information available.| Recommendation 12: The quality and accuracy of CAM information on the Internet should be improved by establishing a voluntary standards board, a public education campaign, and actions to protect consumers' privacy. Actions |12.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should form a public-private partnership to review new and existing websites and to develop voluntary standards promoting accuracy, fairness, comprehensiveness, and timeliness of information on CAM web sites, as well as the disclosure of sources of support and possible conflicts of interest. Sites reviewed and found in compliance with the standards could publicize the fact and display a logo denoting their merit. [DHHS's healthfinder.gov already does a poor job of sorting out reliable and unreliable sources of CAM information. There is no reason to believe that another government-sponsored system would work better.]| |12.2||Funding should be provided to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education to conduct a joint public education campaign that teaches consumers how to evaluate health care information, including CAM information, on the Internet and elsewhere. [Whether or not such information is useful would depend upon who compiles and controls it. So far \u2014 for political reasons \u2014 the government-generated teachings about CAM methods have been woefully inadequate. There is no reason to believe that additional funding will modify this situation.]| |12.3||Congress should protect consumers' privacy by requiring all health information sites, including CAM sites, to disclose whether they track users and if so, how that information is used and stored, including whether it is sold to third parties. [Individual privacy should be protected regardless of what information is sought.]| Recommendation 13: Information on the training and education of providers of CAM services should be made easily available to the public. Actions |13.1||The Commission recommends that states require all persons providing CAM services to disclose information regarding their level and scope of training and to make it easily available to consumers. [Consumers who want this information are already free to ask for it. Requiring qualified practitioners to provide it without being asked will merely increase their overhead. Requiring unqualified practitioners to disclose their background would only be useful if consumers could judge the validity of nonstandard credentials \u2014 something very few people can do. The real way to protect consumers is to prevent unqualified individuals from practicing.]| |13.2||The Commission recommends that states disclose information on State guidelines, requirements, licensure, certification, and disciplinary actions of health providers, including CAM providers, and make it easily accessible to the public. [Some state licensing boards already provide such information.Whether doing this is cost-effective and actually protects people has not been demonstrated. Curiously, far less public information is available about chiropractors than about medical doctors and other mainstream practitioners.]| Recommendation 14: CAM products that are available to U.S. consumers should be safe and meet appropriate standards of quality and consistency. Actions |14.1||The efforts of both the public and private sectors to ensure the development, validation, and dissemination of analytical methods and reference materials for dietary supplements should be accelerated.| |14.2||The proposed Good Manufacturing Practices for Dietary Supplements should be published expeditiously, followed by a timely review of comments and completion of a final rule. The Food and Drug Administration should be provided with adequate resources to complete this task. [GMPs deal mainly with the technicalities of manufacturing and the cleanliness of manufacturing and storage facilities. They are not a substitute for ensuring that the health claims for such products are legitimate. Worthless or dangerous products prepared according to GMPs are still worthless or dangerous.]| |14.3||Adequate funding should be provided to appropriate Federal agencies, including U.S. Customs and Food and Drug Administration inspection authorities, to enforce current laws monitoring the quality of imported raw materials and finished products intended for use as dietary supplements. [The FDA already has the legislative tools to do this, but many other tasks compete for attention from its limited resources.]| |14.4||Manufacturers should have on file and make available to the FDA upon request scientific information to substantiate their determinations of safety, and current statutory provisions should be periodically reexamined to determine whether safety requirements for dietary supplements are adequate. [Manufacturers are already required to have information available to the FDA, but it is obvious that current laws do not protect the public. The only way to protect the public is to require proof of safety and effectiveness before marketing.]| |14.5||An objective process for evaluating the safety of dietary supplement products should be developed by an independent expert panel. [It is not possible to evaluate safety without considering effectiveness.]| Recommendation 15: Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as modified by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, should be fully implemented, funded, enforced, and evaluated. Actions |15.1||The Food and Drug Administration and other agencies with regulatory responsibilities should be provided with additional resources to 1) enforce the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act's regulations regarding labeling of dietary supplements, 2) enforce current provisions requiring that dietary supplements be labeled in English, even if the same information is also included in another language, and 3) employ additional professionals with expertise in dietary supplements. [It is difficult to understand, in practical terms, what such \"additional resources\" would accomplish. It would be far more effective to demand that products be proven safe and effective before they are marketed.]| |15.2||Current provisions requiring disclosure of material facts by manufacturers of CAM products should be enforced, and manufacturers should meet their responsibility to disclose material facts on the label, package, and/or package insert, so that the public will have information about known risks and well-documented significant interactions. Information on potential benefits of dietary supplements should also be made easily available at the time of purchase. [Current drug laws require that products marketed for the prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of disease be labeled with adequate directions for their intended uses. If dietary supplements (and herbs) had to meet this standard, the industry would collapse.]| |15.3||Congress should periodically evaluate the effectiveness, limitations, and enforcement of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, including its impact on public health, and take appropriate action to ensure the public's safety. [The impact is obvious: since its passage, the marketplace has been flooded with unsubstantiated claims for dietary supplements and herbs. The only appropriate action would be to repeal the law.]| Recommendation 16: Activities to ensure that advertising of dietary supplements and other CAM practices and products is truthful and not misleading should be increased. Actions |16.1||Congress should provide additional support to the Federal Trade Commission to 1) expand efforts to identify false and deceptive advertising of CAM-related health services and products and take appropriate enforcement action when necessary, 2) use appropriate CAM experts in the process of examination of CAM-related advertising, 3) increase activities to help consumers distinguish useful and reliable information from deceptive and unsubstantiated advertising in all forms of marketing and advertising, including at the point of purchase; and 4) seek additional public comment on the benefits and potential problems in the advertising of CAM-related services and products. [This is an excellent recommendation. However, although stronger federal action could drive many CAM entrepreneurs out of business, the U.S. Congress is dominated by CAM advocates who have seriously weakened consumer protection during the past decade. If WHCCAMP really wants more protection for consumers, it should advocate repealing the 1994 Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act which severely weakened FDA enforcement powers. And it should also oppose CAM advocates' efforts to weaken FTC enforcement in the same way.]| Recommendation 17: The collection and dissemination of information about adverse events stemming from the use of dietary supplements should be improved. Actions |17.1||Congress should require dietary supplement manufacturers and suppliers to register with the Food and Drug Administration, and the agency should encourage voluntary registration until such a requirement is in effect, so that manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers can be promptly notified if a serious adverse event is identified. [This is one of the few valid ideas in the WHCCAMP report.]| |17.2||Recent congressional support for improving the Food and Drug Administration's adverse events reporting system should be enhanced by requiring dietary supplement manufacturers and suppliers to maintain records and report serious adverse events to the agency. [This is one of the few valid ideas in the WHCCAMP report.]| |17.3||Additional resources and support should be provided to 1) the Food and Drug Administration to simplify the adverse events reporting system for dietary supplements, and to streamline the database for timely review and follow-up on received reports; and 2) the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other appropriate Federal agencies to increase outreach activities to consumers, health professionals (including poison control centers, emergency room physicians, CAM practitioners, and mid-level marketers) in order to improve both manufacturers' and the public's awareness of and participation in voluntary event reporting. [This might be useful, but it would be more efficient to require that products be proven safe and effective before marketing.]| ACCESS AND DELIVERY Recommendation 18: The Department of Health and Human Services should evaluate current barriers to consumer access to safe and effective CAM practices and to qualified practitioners and should develop strategies for removing those barriers in order to increase access and to ensure accountability. Actions |18.1||The Department of Health and Human Services should assist the States in evaluating the impact of legislation enacted by various States on access to CAM practices and on public safety. [How useful this would be would depends on whether it is done properly.]| |18.2||The Department of Health and Human Services and other appropriate Federal agencies should use health care workforce data, data from national surveys on use of CAM, regional public health reports on CAM activities and other studies to identify current and future health care needs and the relevance of safe and effective CAM services for helping address these needs. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe and effective \"CAM\" activities. No data can identify a \"need\" for \"CAM\" products or services that have not been proven safe and effective.]| Recommendation 19: The Federal Government should offer assistance to states and professional organizations in 1) developing and evaluating guidelines for practitioner accountability and competence in CAM delivery, including regulation of practice, and 2) periodic review and assessment of the effects of regulations on consumer protection. Actions |19.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should create a policy advisory committee, including CAM and conventional practitioners and representatives of the public, to address issues related to providing access to qualified CAM practitioners, provide guidance to the states concerning regulation possibilities, and provide a forum for dialogue on other issues related to maximizing access. [Although standard biomedicine can apply criteria of facts and reason in order to develop effective methods of training and qualification, \"CAM\" possesses no such body of evidence or method. Rational methods need no special protection. Irrational methods cannot be made safe by writing guidelines.]| |19.2||The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with states, should assist CAM organizations that wish to develop consensus within their field of practice regarding standards of practice, including education and training. The conclusions reached by CAM professional groups concerning these matters should be considered by states and regulatory bodies in determining the appropriate status of these practitioners for such regulatory options as registration, licensure or exemption. [Although standard biomedicine can apply criteria of facts and reason to develop practice standards, \"CAM\" possesses no such body of evidence. There can be no objective standards for determining who is a \"qualified CAM practitioner.\" The basic requirement for professional practice should be knowledge of scientifically sound practices. Self-identification or recognition as a \"CAM\" or \"conventional\" professional is irrelevant.]| Recommendation 20: States should evaluate and review their regulation of CAM practitioners and ensure their accountability to the public. States should, as appropriate, implement provisions for licensure, registration, and exemption consistent with the practitioners' education, training, and scope of practice. Action |20.1||The Department of Health and Human Services' policy advisory committee, in partnership with state legislatures, regulatory boards, and CAM practitioners, should develop model guidelines or other guidance for the regulation and oversight of licensed and registered practitioners who use CAM services and products. This guidance should balance concerns regarding protection of the public from the inappropriate practice of health care, provide opportunities for appropriately trained and qualified health practitioners to offer the full range of services in which they are trained and competent, maintain competition in the provision of CAM and other health services, preserve CAM styles and traditions that have been valued by both practitioners and consumers, and determine the extent of the public's choice among health care modalities. [This falsely assumes that there are many \"appropriately trained and qualified \"CAM\" practitioners and that consumer use is a measure of effectiuveness. Moreover, there is no logical reason why guidelines and standards should depend on whether or not somthing is marketed as \"CAM.\" This recommendation calls for weakening consumer protection against quackery.]| Recommendation 21: Nationally recognized accrediting bodies should evaluate how health care organizations under their oversight are using CAM practices and should develop strategies for the safe and appropriate use of qualified CAM practitioners and safe and effective products in these organizations. Actions |21.1||National accrediting bodies, in partnership with other public and private organizations, should evaluate present uses of CAM practitioners in health care delivery settings and develop strategies for their appropriate use in ways that will benefit the public. [This falsely assumes that there are many such uses. It deliberately avoids mention of inappropriate uses and what to do about them.]| |21.2||Nationally recognized accrediting bodies of health care organizations and facilities should consider increasing on-going access to CAM expertise to ensure that processes to develop accreditation standards and interpretations reflect emerging developments in the health care field. [Current continuing medical education standards| |21.3||Nationally recognized accrediting bodies, using CAM experts, should review and evaluate current standards and guidelines to ensure the safe use of CAM practices and products in health care delivery organizations. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe \"CAM\" practices and products. As usual, it also fails to call for review intended to exclude unsafe and ineffective modalities.]| Recommendation 22: The Federal government should facilitate and support the evaluation and implementation of safe and effective CAM practices to help meet the health care needs of special and vulnerable populations. Actions |22.1||The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal Departments should identify models of health care delivery that include safe and effective CAM practices, evaluate them, and then support those models which are successful for use with special and vulnerable populations, including the chronically and terminally ill. [This repeats the false assumtpion that many such \"CAM\" methods exist.]| |22.2||The Department of Health and Human Services should sponsor the development and evaluation of demonstration projects that integrate the use of safe and effective CAM services as part of the health care programs in hospices and community health centers. [This repeats the false assumtpion that many such \"CAM\" methods exist.]| |22.3||The Department of Health and Human Services should identify ways to support the practice of indigenous healing in the United States and to improve communication among indigenous healers, conventional health care professionals, and CAM practitioners. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe and effective indigenous healing practices.]| COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT Recommendation 23: Evidence should be developed and disseminated regarding the safety, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of CAM interventions, as well as the optimum models for complementary and integrated care. Actions |23.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should convene a joint public and private task force to identify and set priorities for studying health services issues related to CAM and to help purchasers and health plans make prudent decisions regarding coverage of and access to CAM. [The only prudent decisions should be to cover methods that have been proven safe, effective, and cost-effective. Whether methods are marketed as \"CAM\" is not relevant.]| |23.2||Federal agencies, States, and private organizations should increase funding for health services research, demonstrations, and evaluations related to CAM, including outcomes of CAM interventions, coverage and access, effective sequencing and integration with conventional therapies, effective models for service delivery, and the use of CAM in underserved, vulnerable, and special populations. [It is pointless to invest limited health-care dollars investigating or deploying methods that have no proven value.]| |23.3||Federal, State, and private entities should fund health services research on the costs, cost-benefits, and cost-effectiveness of CAM interventions and wellness programs. [This falsely assumes that such research will provide substantial benefits.]| |23.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the National Committee for Vital and Health Statistics should authorize a national coding system that supports standardized data for CAM. This system should make possible the collection of data for clinical and health services research on CAM, and support compliance with the electronic claims requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. [Few interventions promoted as CAM have been proven safe and effective for their intended purposes. There is no logical reason to assign insurance codes to methods that are unproven and/or irrational.]| |23.5||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, through its clearinghouse, should provide information on health services research, demonstrations, and evaluations of CAM services and products. [The NCCAM and its predecessors were created for this purpose but have not identified a single \"safe and effective service or product.\" Nor have they set up an honest clearinghouse. People who ask for information about specific practices are usually referred to proponents and almost never referred to science-based critics.]| |23.6||Public agencies and private organizations should support the development of informational programs on CAM targeted to health plan purchasers and sponsors, health insurers, managed care organizations, consumer groups, and others involved in the provision of health care services. [The amount of useful information that fits this description is trivial. This appears to be a brazen proposal for goverment agencies to help market \"CAM\" methods. If anything, the public needs more information about what CAM methods are known to be ineffective.]| |23.7||Congress should request periodic reports from appropriate Federal departments on coverage of and reimbursement for CAM practices and products for Federal beneficiaries, Medicaid beneficiaries, Federal employees, military personnel, veterans, and eligible family members and retirees, as well as any legislative, regulatory, or programmatic impediments to covering safe and effective CAM interventions. [The big \"impediment\" is lack of evidence that they work. Unless \"CAM services and products\" are proven useful, there is no reason for policymakers to concern themselves about third-party reimbursements unless they want to know how much money is being wasted.]| Recommendation 24: Insurers and managed care organizations should offer purchasers the option of health benefit plans that incorporate coverage of safe and effective CAM interventions provided by qualified practitioners. Actions |24.1||Health insurance and managed care companies should modify their benefit design and coverage processes in order to offer purchasers, for their consideration, health benefit plans that include safe and effective CAM interventions. [Most insurance companies need no prodding to cover methods that have been proven effective. The vast majority of \"CAM\" methods have not even been scientifically tested.]| |24.2||Health insurance and managed care companies should make use of CAM expertise in the development of benefit plans that include safe and effective CAM interventions. [This falsely assumes that such methods are useful and that \"CAM\" advocates can be trusted to sort out what should be covered.]| |24.3||Health insurers, managed care organizations, CAM professional associations, CAM experts, private organizations that develop medical criteria, and Federal agencies are encouraged to develop appropriate clinical criteria and guidelines for the use of CAM services and products. [This falsely assumes that many such modalities exist and that \"CAM\" advocates can offer reliable advice.]| Recommendation 25: Purchasers, including Federal agencies and employers, should evaluate the possibility of covering benefits or adding health benefit plans that incorporate safe and effective CAM interventions. Actions |25.1||Employers, Federal agencies, other purchasers and sponsors should enhance the processes they use to develop health benefits and give consideration to safe and effective CAM interventions.| |25.2||Public purchasers such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Defense, employers, other health benefit sponsors, and health industry organizations should include CAM practitioners and experts on advisory bodies and workgroups considering CAM benefits and other health benefit issues. [This falsely assumes that many such modalities exist and that \"CAM\" advocates can offer reliable advice.]| |25.3||The Secretary of Health and Human Services, preferably through the Federal CAM coordinating office when established, should maintain a list of opportunities for CAM experts to participate on advisory committees and other workgroups. [This assumes that \"CAM\" advocates can offer reliable advice. The WHCCAMP report shows the absurdity of this assumption.]| |25.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should direct agencies under his authority to convene workgroups and conferences to assess the state-of-the-science of CAM services and products and to develop consensus and other guidance on their use. [Government agencies normally promote methods that have been proven effective. There is no reason to give special consideration to methods that are marketed as \"CAM.\"]| |25.5||State governments should consider, as part of evaluating and reviewing their regulations, how regulation of CAM practitioners could affect third-party coverage of safe and effective CAM interventions. [Third party coverage is normally based on scientific merit. \"CAM\" advocates hope to promote through political means what they cannot accomplish through science.]| CAM IN WELLNESS AND HEALTH PROMOTION Recommendation 26: The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal agencies and public and private organizations should evaluate CAM practices and products that have been shown to be safe and effective to determine their potential to promote wellness and help achieve the nation's health promotion and disease prevention goals. Demonstration programs should be funded for those determined to have benefit. Actions |26.1.||The Healthy People Consortium should evaluate the role of safe and effective CAM practices and products in addressing the10 leading health indicators and develop strategies, including demonstration programs, to encourage the use of CAM practices and products found to be beneficial in addressing these indicators. [This recommendation incorrectly assumes that there are valid CAM principles and practices that the scientific community is neglecting. CAM advocates attempt to boost their credibility by including diet, nutrition, and exercise within their scope. However, the scientific mainstream has addressed these areas for decades.]| |26.2||Questions on the extent and use of CAM products and practices should be included in national surveys and other assessment tools including the National Health Interview Survey, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Where appropriate, information from these sources should be incorporated into the Healthy People 2020 goals and objectives. [It would be worthwhile to investigate the harmful impact of irrational and unsubstantiated methods. However, surveys that merely assess the \"popularity\" of such methods might make them appear more legitimate.]| |26.3||The Department of Health and Human Services, as part of the Healthy People 2010 initiative, should support the development of a national campaign to teach and encourage behaviors that focus on improving nutrition, promoting exercise, and teaching stress management for all Americans, especially children. This campaign should include safe and effective CAM practices and products where appropriate. [This is a crass attempt to equate \"CAM\" with \"healthy behaviors\" without any evidence to support such an association. There is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children. In fact, many chiropractors, naturopaths and other practitioners denigrate and oppose the proven public health measures of vaccination and fluoridation.]| |26.4||The Federal government, in partnership with public and private organizations, should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to improving nutrition, promoting exercise, and teaching stress management to children. Demonstration programs should be funded for those found to be applicable to children. [As noted in #26.3, there is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children.]| |26.5||The Health Resources and Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Education, and other Federal agencies that develop school health guidelines should evaluate the potential applicability of safe and effective CAM practices and products to these school health guidelines. Those found to have benefits should be included in the guidelines. [As noted in #26.3, there is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children.]| |26.6||Federal agencies, in partnership with the business community, should develop incentives for schools to make lunches and snacks healthful, and to limit the sale \u2014 and eliminate the advertisin \u2014 -of high-fat snacks, soft drinks, and other products that do not contribute to healthy lifestyles. [There are valid reasons to promote good health habits to children, but this activity has nothing to do with \"CAM.\"]| |26.7||The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their potential role in workplace wellness and prevention activities, and include them in Federal workplace wellness and health promotion programs and Federal health coverage plans when appropriate. [There is no reason to believe that this would be better than simply encouraging good health habits that have little or nothing to do with \"CAM.\" \"CAM\" programs that disparage standard care or advocate irrational methods would have a negative impact on the health of federal workers.]| |26.8||Federal agencies, in conjunction with the business community, should develop incentives for employers to include CAM practices and products found to be beneficial in wellness and prevention activities in their workplace wellness programs and health coverage. [There is no reason to believe that this would be better than simply encouraging good health habits that have little or nothing to do with \"CAM.\" \"CAM\" programs that disparage standard care or advocate irrational methods would have a negative impact on the health of federal workers.]| Recommendation 27: Federal, State, public, and private health care delivery systems and programs should evaluate CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to programs and services that help promote wellness and health. Demonstration programs should be funded for those determined to be beneficial. Actions |27.1||The Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, and Defense and the Commissioner of the Administration for Children and Families, should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products that contribute to wellness and health and determine their applicability to Federal health systems and programs. [This falsely assumes that many safe and effective \"CAM\" practices and products exist and need special federal promotion to gain recognition.]| |27.2||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should facilitate the bringing together of public and private health care organizations to evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products that contribute to wellness and health and determine their applicability to health systems and programs, especially in the nation's hospitals and long-term care facilities and in programs serving the aging, those with chronic illness, and those at the end of life. [There is no logical reason to believe that adding \"CAM\" services to health systems or programs would make such programs more effective or cost-effective. Before investing in any such research, there should be data showing that such an investment would be worthwhile.]| |27.3||CAM and conventional health professional training programs should consider offering training and educational opportunities for students in self-care and lifestyle decision-making to improve practitioners' health and to enable practitioners to impart this knowledge to their patients or clients. [Conventional training and public health programs already offer this. There is no reason to believe that \"CAM\" practitioners have something additional to offer.]| Recommendation 28: Research on the role of CAM in wellness and health promotion, the application of CAM principles and practices, and the role of CAM practitioners in the management of chronic disease should be expanded. Actions |28.1||The Department of Health and Human Services should fund demonstration projects to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of comprehensive health promotion programs that include CAM. These studies should include underserved and special populations. [There is no logical reason to believe that offering \"CAM\" services to underserved and special populations will enhance their health.]| |28.1||The Federal government and private health organizations should evaluate CAM practices and products that are currently being used for wellness and health promotion to determine their effectiveness and applicability to the management of chronic disease. Funding should be provided for demonstration projects in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and other Federal agencies for those CAM practices and products found to have benefit in the management of chronic disease, end of life such as hospice. [This falsely assumes that many \"CAM\" practices and products can be proven useful to chronically and terminallly ill patients and deserve special funding priority.]| COORDINATING FEDERAL EFFORTS Recommendation 29: The President, Secretary of Health and Human Services, or Congress should create an office to coordinate Federal CAM activities and to facilitate the integration into the nation's health care system of those complementary and alternative health care practices and products determined to be safe and effective. Actions |29.1||The office should be established at the highest possible and most appropriate level in the Department of Health and Human Services and should be given sufficient staff and budget to meet its responsibilities. [It would be absurd to create an \"office at the highest possible level\" to promote so-called CAM. Doing that would constitute a government endorsement of homeopathy, therapeutic touch, cranial osteopathy, rebirthing and many other preposterous practices that have been embraced by one or more members of Commission.]| |29.2||The office should charter an advisory council. Members should include CAM and conventional practitioners with expertise, diverse backgrounds, and necessary training, as well as representatives of both the private and public sectors, to guide and advise the office about its activities. [Previous advisory councils have been composed almost entirely of \"CAM\" advocates and have included few if any knowledgeable critics.]| |29.3||The office's responsibilities should include, but not be limited to, coordinating Federal CAM activities; serving as a Federal CAM policy liaison with conventional health care and CAM professionals, organizations, institutions, and commercial ventures; planning, facilitating, and convening conferences, workshops, and advisory groups; acting as a centralized Federal point of contact regarding CAM for the public, CAM practitioners, conventional health care providers, and the media; facilitating implementation of the Commission's recommendations and actions; and exploring additional and emerging topics not considered by the Commission.|[WHCCAMP Analysis Index](https://www.quackwatch.org/07PoliticalActivities/WHC/00.html) ||| [Quackwatch Home Page](https://www.quackwatch.org/index.html)This article was posted on March 25, 2002. [Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-nine-hundred-sixty-one) [Analysis of the Final WHCCAMP Report: Chapter 2](https://quackwatch.org/political-activities/whc/2-2/) [Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD and Timothy N. Gorski, MD, FACOG]Complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM, can be defined as a group of medical, health care, and healing systems other than those included in mainstream health care in the United States. CAM includes the worldviews, theories, modalities, products, and practices associated with these systems and their use to treat illness and promote health and well-being. Although heterogeneous, the major CAM systems have many common characteristics, including a focus on individualizing treatments, treating the whole person, promoting self-care and self-healing, and recognizing the spiritual nature of each individual.

[Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD and Timothy N. Gorski, MD, FACOG]Complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM, can be defined as a group of medical, health care, and healing systems other than those included in mainstream health care in the United States. CAM includes the worldviews, theories, modalities, products, and practices associated with these systems and their use to treat illness and promote health and well-being. Although heterogeneous, the major CAM systems have many common characteristics, including a focus on individualizing treatments, treating the whole person, promoting self-care and self-healing, and recognizing the spiritual nature of each individual. [These are buzzwords used for marketing purposes. No studies have demonstrated that \"CAM\" practitioners actually do more than conventional practitioners to \"individualize treatments,\" \"treat the whole person,\" \"promote self-healing,\" or do more than conventional practitioners to \"recognize individual spirituality.\" In addition, many CAM systems have characteristics commonly found in mainstream health care, such as a focus on good nutrition and preventive practices. [\"CAM\" versions of nutrition and preventive care often include bogus diagnostic tests, inappropriate ecommendations for dietary supplements, and fad dietary strategies. In addition, large percentages of chiropractors, naturopaths, and various other \"CAM\" advocates do not recommend vaccination. \"CAM\" advocates have added almost nothing useful to mainstream nutrition or public health practices.] Unlike mainstream medicine, CAM often lacks or has only limited experimental and clinical study; however, scientific investigation of CAM is beginning to address this knowledge gap. Thus, boundaries between CAM and mainstream medicine, as well as among different CAM systems, are often blurred and are constantly changing. [This is a gross exaggeration. \"CAM\" research has produced almost nothing of value.] Examples of the health care systems, practices, and products typically classified as CAM in the United States are listed in Table 1. |Major Domains of CAM Examples Under Each Domain||Examples Under Each Domain| |Alternative health care systems||Ayurvedic medicine | Chiropractic Homeopathic medicine Native American medicine (e.g., sweat lodge, medicine wheel) Naturopathic medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine (e.g., acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine) |Mind-Body interventions||Meditation | Hypnosis Guided imagery Dance therapy Music therapy Art therapy Prayer and mental healing |Biological based therapies||Herbal therapies | Special diets (e.g. macrobiotics, extremely low-fat or high carbohydrate diets) Orthomolecular medicine (e.g., megavitamin therapy) Individual biological therapies (e.g., shark cartilage, bee pollen) |Therapeutic Massage, | Body Work, and Somatic Movement Therapies |Massage | Feldenkrais Alexander Method |Energy Therapies||Qigong | Reiki Therapeutic Touch |Bioelectromagnetics||Magnet therapy| Many of the CAM systems of health care listed in Table 1 have evolved from the collective clinical experiences of many practitioners over generations of practice, such as in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Others have evolved from the clinical experiences of a single practitioner or small groups of practitioners who have developed a particular intervention. [A few would be more properly described as part of conventional care. Some of are so irrational that further study is not needed to conclude that they should be abandoned.] Despite their diversity, there are some common threads that run among many traditional systems of health care as well as systems that have emerged more recently. These similarities include an emphasis on whole systems, the promotion of self-care and the stimulation of self-healing processes, the integration of mind and body, the spiritual nature of illness and healing, and the prevention of illness by enhancing the vital energy, or subtle forces, in the body [1]. [\"Promotion of self healing\" and \"enhancing vital energy\" are quack concepts that cannot be demonstrated.] Convergence of CAM and Mainstream Healthcare Some of the common threads that run through CAM health care systems also are part of mainstream, or conventional, health care. For example, conventional medicine has a long tradition of being concerned with preventing disease as evidenced by the development of programs for immunizations, healthier mothers and babies, family planning, safer and healthier foods, fluoridation of drinking water, control of infectious diseases, reducing deaths from heart disease and stroke, decreasing the use of tobacco products, and promoting motor vehicle safety and safer workplaces [2]. [The idea that \"CAM\" health care generally advocates a broad specturm of preventive and public health measures is a flat lie. Only about a third of chiropractors advocate immunization and two national chiropractic organizations strongly oppose it. Naturopaths do not generally support immunization and fluoridation. None \"CAM\" organizations has aggressively attacked the problem of tobacco use. Some \"CAM\" advocates promote concepts of \"safer foods\" that encourage consumers to waste money buying \"orgnically grown\" products.] Mainstream or conventional health care also has long-recognized that good nutrition and exercise are important components of a healthy lifestyle [3,4]. There also is a growing recognition within conventional health care that biopsychosocial and spiritual factors may play an important role in promoting health and preventing illness [5,6]. The difference between conventional and CAM health care systems in many of these areas, however, is one of emphasis. [No surveys have demonstrated that this assertion is true or that the lnutrition strategies advocated by \"CAM\" practitioners are valid. With respect to chiropractors, for example, many of their publications and continung education courses make false of improbable claims for a wide variety of dietary supplement products; but their publications and programs almost never contain information about dietary guidelines or cholesterol management.] In part, because of the many technological advances that have occurred in conventional health care over the years (see Recent History of CAM section, below), pharmacological, surgical, and other technological approaches have come to dominate conventional health care. While acknowledged, prevention and wellness promotion have been underemphasized. For example, according to a recent report by the Nutrition Education Consortium, the teaching of nutrition in medical schools and residency programs remains \"woefully inadequate,\" [7] and a survey by Cooksey et al. [8] found that most medical schools do not have faculty trained specifically in nutrition. As a result of this lack of training in nutrition in medical education, many practicing physicians are not adequately prepared to provide nutrition counseling to their patients. However, registered dieticians and clinical nutritionists are employed by hospitals and clinics. These are the specialists who are trained in this area and are well established in the conventional health care system. Because many CAM approaches often focus on prevention rather than cure [9], they have come to be identified with wellness and self-care. [Note that the citation for this highly questionable statement is a book written by WCCAMP's chairman, James S. Gordon.] This may be a reflection of history, as effective treatments for many of the infections and severe injuries that occurred were lacking. Traditional systems were better able to strengthen the individual and attempt to prevent disease than to treat many of the illnesses that killed millions even one hundred years ago. This is not to imply that CAM systems of health care are more effective than conventional health care in promoting health and preventing illness, as many have not been scientifically shown to prevent disease or promote health. [It is clearly intended to imply that \"CAM\" practitioners are doing more than maintstream practitioners.] The perception that conventional health care emphasizes high technology approaches to treating patients, while CAM health care emphasizes low technology approaches to promoting health and preventing disease, has led some to suggest that conventional and CAM health care may eventually converge to form a new health care system that integrates the best of each [10]. However, there are not only scientific, but also educational, regulatory, and political obstacles to integration of the two systems. [This falsely implies that \"CAM health care\" is a system. \"Integrated is merely another term for \"complementary.\"] Evolution of CAM Terminology As interest in and use of non-mainstream health care practices has evolved in this country over the past several decades, the terminology used to describe CAM systems, practices, and products has had to evolve accordingly. Rather than focus on what these \"other\" health care systems are not (i.e., \"unorthodox, \"unconventional,\" or \"unscientific\"), more recent terminology has begun to focus on what these systems are and how they might be used. [The new terminology, of course, is more deceptive.] For example, because many consumers appeared to be using unconventional health care practices as alternatives to conventional health care, the term \"alternative medicine\" was widely adopted in the United States and Europe in the later 1980s [11,12]. This perception, however, was largely dispelled by surveys in the early 1990's, which found that people were using the two systems of health care \u2014 mainstream and alternative \u2014 simultaneously [13,14]. [\"Alternative\" is not a system. It is a marketing term intended to make people believe that unproven methods are genuine alternatives. These surveys found that health care consumers were accessing a range of therapeutic and preventive options, both alternative and conventional, to essentially \"complement\" one another. [That phraseology is used to dignify the word \"complementary.\"] As a result, the term \"complementary medicine\" was widely adopted not long afterwards to describe systems of health care and individual therapies that people used as adjuncts to their conventional health care [15,16]. [As far as we can tell, the original suggested meaning was the use of both \"alternative\" and established methods, using the best of both. This did not actually describe what \"CAM\" practitioners did but enabled them to pretend that they offered something extra rather than something useless.] A more recent and detailed survey conducted by Astin [17] has found that, although many unconventional therapies were being used to complement mainstream medical care, some were being used instead of conventional medical care. These data suggested that the term \"complementary\" was only partially descriptive of what was occurring in the marketplace. To acknowledge this dichotomy, Congress adopted the phrase \"complementary and alternative medicine\" and applied it to the National Institutes of Health's National Center on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), when the Office of Alternative Medicine was elevated to the status of a coordinating research \"Center\" in 1999. Even this terminology is unsatisfactory to many because it does not reflect emerging models of health care that have arisen in the overlapping areas between these various systems. [This statement is meaningless because \"CAM\" is a hodgepodge, not a \"system.\"] Nor does it account for the fact that health care systems, practices, and products that are not widely accepted or readily available in one part of the United States may be fully accepted and easily available in another. Members of the Commission considered other terms, such as \"integrative health care,\" \" collaborative health care,\" \"comprehensive health care,\" and \"\"holistic health care,\" but chose to use the term \"complementary and alternative medicine\" because it is used in the President's Executive Order and is widely recognized by the media and in the scientific literature. To fully understand the complexities of CAM as well as its current relationship with conventional health care in this country, it is necessary to understand its recent history, its current status, and future prospects, including emerging models of integrative and collaborative care. Recent History of CAM in the United States The history of CAM in the U.S. is a long, complex story that has been shaped by scientific, economic, and social factors. A detailed rendering of this history is beyond the scope of this report. This section instead provides a brief overview of the more recent developments that have helped shape the present status of CAM in this country and its prospects for contributing to the health and well being of our nation. Early American health care consisted of an eclectic mix of systems. In fact, until the middle of the 19th century, the vast majority of primary medical care in this country was provided by botanical healers, midwives, chiropractors, homeopaths, and an assortment of other lay healers offering a variety herbs and nostrums for a range of illnesses [18-20]. This began to change in the latter part of the 19th century, however, with the development and validation of the germ theory and significant scientific advances in antiseptic techniques, anesthesia, and surgery. Beginning in the late 1800s and lasting until the early 20th century there also was a major revolution in medical education that helped scientific medicine evolve into the dominant health care system in this country. This revolution in medical education began with the publication of William Osler's (1847-1919) textbook, The Principles and Practice of Medicine in 1892, which brought diagnostic clarity to medical practice. By 1905 Osler's textbook was the primary medical textbook in the vast majority of U.S. medical schools [21]. This revolution culminated with the release of a report by Abraham Flexner in 1910 [22] that served to crystallize the educational reform movement. After the release of the Flexner report, many medical institutions that did not meet its standards were driven out of business or forced to implement significantly more rigorous training programs [21]. Schools for many unorthodox healing systems either ceased to exist or became marginalized [20]. The isolation and elaboration of life-saving hormones, sulfa drugs, and other antibiotics in the early and middle of the 20th century, conventional medicine cemented its place as the nation's preeminent form of health care in this country. Although most of the other health care systems and their therapies did not disappear, they were considered by most of the public and the mainstream medical community to be unscientific relics of the past. As a result, many were practiced in relative obscurity. With the reduced threat of infectious diseases and other acute illnesses, conventional medicine began turned its focus to the more complex and costly problems of chronic, degenerative illnesses. As a result of public health interventions developed earlier in the 20th century, people began living significantly longer. This gradual aging of the population began to significantly increase the prevalence of chronic conditions, such as arthritis, back pain, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and cancer, putting further pressure on conventional medicine to address these conditions. As the health care system developed more sophisticated means of diagnosing and managing chronic illnesses, the cost of health care began to rise dramatically. Between 1965 and 1975, national health care expenditures more than tripled, rising from just over $41 billion to nearly $130 billion. Although employers and government programs covered some of these increases, out-of-pocket expenditures more than doubled during this same period [23]. Since then costs have continued to rise, with national health care expenditures reaching more than $1.2 trillion in 2000, the latest year for which such figures are available, and they are expected to reach more than $2.6 trillion by 2010. It was during this time of increasing rates of chronic illness and escalating health care costs that medical pluralism began to reemerge in this country. This reemergence was spurred on by a number of overlapping and sometimes interrelated movements. [A major factor was the deveopment of television, which enabled promoters of quackery to reach large audiences.] Beginning in the 1950s, the whole foods and dietary supplement movements began to change Americans' view of food as not only something they needed to stay alive but also as potential therapeutic agents. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Americans were increasingly exposed to a variety of traditional health care systems from foreign and indigenous cultures, many of which dated back to antiquity [24]. New York Times writer James Reston's account of his emergency appendectomy in a Chinese hospital during then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's visit to China in 1971 was particularly influential in this process [25]. Reston's article described how his postoperative pain and discomfort were relieved by acupuncture and herbs. For most Americans, this was their first glimpse of Traditional Chinese Medicine and its potential uses. During this same period, the growing \"counterculture\" movement in America sparked a fascination with the religious and philosophical traditions of Asian cultures. Transcendental Meditation, which is derived from Hinduism, became widely known and practiced [25]. Meanwhile, there was a growing interest in indigenous health care traditions, such as Native American and Mexican-American health care practices, particularly their reliance on herbs and natural substances. This movement, in turn, led to a renewed interest in \"natural\" health care movements that had developed in this country in the 19th century but had been relegated to the background of the American health care landscape. The late 1970s saw the emergence of the holistic health care movement in this country. Holistic practice (holism comes from the Greek word \"holos\" or \"whole\") emphasized an attention to the whole person, including the physical, spiritual, psychological, and ecological dimensions of healing. Holistic health care incorporates practices and concepts of Eastern philosophy and diverse cultural traditions, including acupuncture and the use of herbs, massage, and relaxation techniques as well as conventional medical practices [26]. It gained its greatest following among nurses [27]. However, many physicians, particularly those in the new specialty of family medicine, also became interested in this movement. [The percentage of physicians who claimed to practice \"holistic medicine\" is probably less than 1%.] The American Holistic Medical and Nurses Associations were formed, large professional and public conferences held, and a number of holistic medical clinics and holistic health centers opened. The late 1970s and early 1980s also was a time when a variety of self-care movements emerged; they offered programs or sponsored events to help individuals and families increase wellness or reduce their risk of onset of illness through diet or lifestyle changes [28,29]. The years since then have been a particularly active time for the personal fitness movement, which increasingly is making use of the techniques of other systems of healing, such as yoga, tai chi, and massage [30]. [These are relaxation tchniques and have little or nothing to do with fitness.] The Current Status of CAM in the United States Today, use of CAM approaches and therapies is more prevalent in a number of patient populations in the Unites States, no matter how narrowly or broadly it is defined. Physicians, hospitals, and other conventional health care organizations also are showing a growing interest in CAM. Although such prevalence of use and interest in CAM is not an indication that these practices are effective, it does suggest that those with chronic conditions and the physicians who treat them are looking for more therapeutic options than are widely available in conventional health care settings. Indeed, for some chronic conditions, state-of-the-art conventional therapies have provided only modest gains. For example, according to a number of assessments over the years, expensive mainstream health care approaches to managing chronic lower back pain often have not been very effective [31-36]. This is perhaps why individuals with back pain are some of the most frequent users of CAM practices. [It would be more appropriate to say that many people undergo spinal manipulation for back pain.] Consumer Use of CAM Practices Because of the dramatic increase in the prevalence of chronic conditions, the past decade has witnessed an acceleration both in consumer interest in and use of CAM practices and/or products. Surveys indicate that those with the most serious and debilitating medical conditions, such as cancer, chronic pain, and HIV, tend to be the most frequent users of CAM practices. CAM usage also appears to be high among certain ethnic populations that have access to their traditional forms of healing. CAM and Cancer A survey that assessed both the prevalence and predictors of CAM use in a comprehensive cancer center population where all were using conventional therapies found that 63 percent had used at least one CAM approach other than a spiritual practice. Women with cancer were more likely to use CAM than men with cancer, and those patients who had surgery, chemotherapy, or both were more likely to use CAM than cancer patients who had neither [37]. Another survey of almost 2,000 tumor registry patients selected at random found that 75 percent had used at least one CAM modality.38 The most frequently used therapies among this group of cancer patients were nutritional approaches (63 percent), massage (53 percent), and herbs (44 percent). The most common reason patients gave for using CAM was to \"stimulate an immune response\" (73 percent). Breast cancer patients were significantly more likely to be consistent users of CAM therapies compared to patients with tumors in other sites areas of the body (84 percent versus 66 percent, respectively). The majority of cancer patients (63 percent) enrolled in clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health used at least one CAM therapy, with an average use of two therapies per person [39]. This same study found that the most frequently utilized therapies were spiritual approaches, relaxation, imagery, exercise, lifestyle, diet (e.g., macrobiotic, vegetarian), and nutritional supplementation therapies. Patients unanimously believed that these CAM treatments helped to improve their quality of life by helping them cope more effectively with stress, decreasing their discomforts related to treatment and the illness itself, and giving them a better sense of control. A similar pattern of CAM usage has been found among men with prostate cancer, with 42 percent of those surveyed using vitamins, prayer or religious practices, and herbs to treat their condition [40]. Most of the men in this survey did not report their use of CAM to their physicians. Most of these surveys included prayer and spirituality under CAM. Many people that attend churches, synagogues, or mosques or other religious entities do not believe that this is essential information for their physician and would not feel compelled to share this information with their physician. On the other hand, the use of botanicals and other dietary supplements during cancer treatment would be a concern if the physician were unaware that their patient was using these products. CAM and Chronic Pain A recent national survey by Astin [17] found that back problems were the most common medical condition (24 percent) for which people reported using CAM treatments. In this survey, neck problems also were associated with frequent use of CAM. Other studies have found that one-third of all patients suffering from back pain choose chiropractors over physicians to treat them, and that chiropractors provided 40 percent of primary care for back pain [41,42]. Moreover, these studies found that chiropractors retained a greater proportion of their patients (92 percent) for subsequent episodes of back pain care than did other providers. Similarly, Krauss and colleagues [43 ] found that CAM practitioners and products were chosen more often than conventional physicians and therapies by those persons with chronic pain (52 versus 34 percent) and headaches (51 versus 19 percent ), as well as by persons suffering from other associated maladies, including depression (34 versus 25 percent), anxiety (42 versus 13 percent), and insomnia (32 versus 16 percent). Surveys of rheumatology patients have found similarly high CAM utilization rates, ranging between 19 and 63 percent, depending on the type and severity of their condition [44]. Other studies have documented that people with painful chronic conditions, including arthritis and headache, and psychological problems (insomnia, depression, and anxiety) are frequent users of CAM therapies, particularly massage, chiropractic, and acupuncture [13,45]. CAM and HIV Infection A recent study of 1,675 HIV-positive men and women using CAM (usually in addition to conventional medication) found that the most frequently reported CAM substances were high doses of vitamin C (63 percent), multiple vitamin and mineral supplements (54 percent), vitamin E (53 percent), and garlic (53 percent).46 The health practitioners most commonly consulted were massage therapists (49 percent), acupuncturists (45 percent), and nutritionists (37 percent). The CAM activities most commonly used were aerobic exercise (63 percent), prayer (58 percent), massage (53 percent), and meditation (46 percent). The majority of this group of HIV-infected individuals consulted with both conventional and CAM providers and used both conventional and CAM medications simultaneously, yet few reported that their conventional and CAM providers worked as a team. Similar observations were made in a survey of 180 HIV-infected people [47]. This study found that almost half (45 percent) of this group had visited a CAM practitioner an average of 12 times per year, compared to only 7 visits per year to their conventional physician or nurse practitioner. More than two-thirds (68 percent) of the HIV-infected individuals in the study used herbs, vitamins, or dietary supplements. Eighty-one percent of those who used supplements said the remedies were \"extremely\" or \"quite a bit\" helpful. Approximately 24 percent reported using marijuana to treat weight loss, nausea, and vomiting in the previous year, and most (87 percent) said it was extremely or quite helpful. Ethnic Differences in CAM Usage In addition to the type and severity of illness one has, people's cultural and ethnic backgrounds can influence their propensity for using CAM. For example, surveys of CAM usage among Mexican-American and Hispanic populations have demonstrated that almost half of respondents have used a CAM practitioner one or more times during the previous year [48,49]. Herbal medicine, spiritual healing techniques, and traditional healers are used quite frequently by these groups. Similarly, surveys of Native American populations have found that they tend to have higher rates of CAM usage than the general U.S. population [50] and are also frequent users of herbal remedies, spiritual healing techniques, and traditional healers.51 Income, not belief systems, prohibits interaction with traditional healers by Native Americans [51]. Reasons People Give for Using CAM The reasons people seek out and use CAM practices are not fully understood. However, strong associations have been found between CAM usage and: 1) an interest in spirituality and personal growth, 2) a commitment to environmentalism, and 3) feminism [16]. In addition, several other studies have found that belief in a holistic approach to health, a strong internal locus of control, and transformational life experiences also are associated with CAM usage [17,52,53]. [The most likely reason that people seek \"CAM\" treatment is misleading publicity.] Although Astin's survey [17] found that only a small percentage (4.4 percent) of people used CAM therapies as alternatives to conventional practitioners and treatments, there is some evidence that they used CAM because they believed it is more effective than conventional medicine. For example, in the survey of rheumatology clinic patients mentioned above [54], 50 percent of respondents reported turning to CAM because they perceived their conventional treatment (drugs) as ineffective. Similarly, when researchers interviewed 113 patients at a family practice, the top reason given for to seeking CAM therapies was that patients believed they would work [54]. A similar study of primary care patients found that: 1) recommendations from friends or coworkers, 2) a desire to avoid the side effects of conventional treatments, and 3) failure of conventional treatments to cure a problem were the most frequently cited reasons for using CAM therapies [55]. In this study, use of practitioner-based CAM therapies was significantly and independently associated with patients' perceived poor health status and emotional functioning and a musculoskeletal disorder, usually low back pain. Patients who used CAM most commonly visited chiropractic (35 percent), used herbal remedies and supplements (27 percent), and sought massage therapy (17 percent). Use of self-care-based therapies was associated with high education and poor perceived general health compared to the previous year. Use of traditional folk remedies was associated with Hispanic ethnicity. Conventional Health Care's Interest in and Use of CAM Evidence suggests that a growing number of physicians already use some CAM practices and consider them safe and effective in offering them to their patients. A comprehensive review of 25 surveys of physician practices and beliefs regarding five commonly used CAM practices \u2014 acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, herbal medicine, and massage \u2014 found that about half of the surveyed physicians believed in the efficacy of these five CAM practices [56]. This study found that a significant proportion of conventional physicians were both referring patients to CAM practitioners and/or offering some of these CAM treatments in their practice. [This paragraph greatly exaggerates the significance of \"comprehensive reviuew.\" Only two of the 25 studies were done within the United States. One of these found very low beliefs, ranging from 49% favoring chiropractic to only 1% believing in homeopathy. The other survey took place at \"family practice\" seminar where many participants expressed interest and belief in the five practices. However, 27.2% of them said that they practiced chiropractic, which means that a many of the responders were not medical doctors but were chiropractors. Thus the published data were meaningless.] In addition, Pelletier and colleagues [57] found that a small, but growing number of insurance companies are offering or are considering coverage for CAM services. [The raw numbers are misleading, because \"CAM\" coverage is typically limited andx offered at extra cost.] CAM also has made significant inroads into conventional medical education, with more than two-thirds of mainstream medical schools currently offering elective courses in CAM or including CAM topics in required courses [58]. However, the acceptance of some CAM practices by the conventional health care community did not come without economic and political power struggles. [The \"power struggles\" did not lead to acceptance.] CAM practitioners have filed suit and won court cases against conventional health care professional associations [59], and in many states CAM professions have faced strong opposition from conventional health care organizations in gaining licensing from state regulatory agencies [60]. Evidence Base for CAM Surveys documenting the rise of interest in and use of CAM by consumers were a significant factor in the biomedical research community's decision to take a serious look at both the safety and efficacy of many CAM approaches and therapies. [Third refers to the establishement of the NIH Office of Unconventional Medicine, which evolved into the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Its establishment had nothing to do with any rise in consumer interest in \"CAM.\" It reasulted from persuading Senator Tom Harkin that the scientific research community was unfairly neglecting research on alleged cancer cures. Harkin has sufficient politcal clout to control legislation related to NIH funding. Harkin was also a key figure in establishing the WHCCAMP.] Federal expenditures for CAM research have risen dramatically since the early 1990s. To date, NCCAM has funded the establishment of 14 research centers to explore the safety and efficacy of a wide range of CAM therapies for a host of conditions. As a result of these and other international efforts, the evidence base for the efficacy a number of CAM approaches and treatments has grown significantly over the past decade. [Regardless of the size of this so-called evidence base, the number of \"CAM\" methods that have been proven safe, effective, and cost-effective is close to zero.] More research on CAM currently exists than is commonly recognized. In fact, the Cochrane Collaboration, an international effort to develop an evidence base for a wide variety of medical therapies, both allopathic and CAM, lists more than 4,000 randomized trials for various CAM therapies in its electronic library. [The number depends on what is included in one's definition of \"CAM.\"] Furthermore, a number of Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews of this worldwide research literature have identified the potential benefits [What is a \"potential\" benefit?] of CAM and related approaches and products for a small number of chronic conditions, including: - Low-fat or modified fat diets for preventing cardiovascular disease [61] - Acupuncture in the management of low back pain and recurrent headaches [62,63] - St John's Wort for treating mild to moderate depression [64] - Herbal and glucosamine therapy for treating osteoarthritis [65,66] - Nutritional supplements for several neurological conditions [67,68] In addition to these Cochrane systematic reviews, an NIH scientific review panel concluded that acupuncture is a plausible option for treating several conditions, including nausea associated with chemotherapy and anesthesia, acute dental pain, headaches, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, fibromyalgia, and depression [69]. [That panel, like this Commission, was stacked with advocates who wrote a loosely worded and poorly reasoned report. Its exact words were that \"acupuncture may be useful. . . .\"] Another NIH review panel concluded that that mind-body techniques, such as meditation and guided imagery, are effective both in the management of painful conditions and the relief of stress and anxiety [70]. All of these literature reviews have concluded that larger, more rigorous studies are needed before definitive statements can be made about the benefits of these therapies. [This seems to be the standard conclusion whenever \"CAM\" research is done.] These data, nevertheless, point to the need for a comprehensive and aggressive research program in several areas of CAM, particularly those areas where CAM practices and products are frequently used adjunctively to mainstream medical care [71]. [Research priorities should be based on the likelhood of useful results, not where methods are popular.] The interaction of conventional and CAM health care systems over the years has made such a research program possible by producing significant improvements in CAM research methodology and data collection [72]. Conventional health care, in turn, has used these improved research methods to examine some CAM practices, found similarities between their practices and CAM practices, and has begun including them in comprehensive care programs [20]. [This statement is false and is not supported by reference #20, whicb says nothing whatsoever about conventional health care including CAM practices in comprehenive care programs.] Safety Issues with CAM Use Despite the promising evidence that some CAM practices may be effective in managing and treating certain chronic conditions, most CAM therapies that are currently being used by consumers have not been studied adequately in regard to either efficacy or safety [73,74]. Even when evidence indicates that a particular CAM approach or modality is safe and effective for a particular condition, new safety concerns may arise when it is used in conjunction with conventional medications, which is the way most consumers use CAM. Even when evidence indicates that a particular CAM approach is safe and effective for a certain condition, new safety concerns may arise when it is used in conjunction with conventional medications, which is the way most consumers use them. A recent review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that some commonly used herbal products can cause serious complications for surgery patients [75]. The potential complications included bleeding, cardiovascular instability, hypoglycemia, and there was evidence that some herbs may increase the strength of anesthetics or the metabolism of many drugs used during and after surgery. The potential adverse interaction of CAM and conventional treatments is particularly troubling to public health officials because most people do not tell their conventional health care providers that they are using CAM services or products. [Even if they did, there is little reason to believe that they would be safer.] A survey of health food stores customers found that although these CAM consumers welcomed a partnership with their physicians, they generally believed that physicians in general were closed-minded and had little knowledge about dietary supplements [54]. [Distrust of the medical profession is probably higher among people who shop in health food store sthan among those who do not.] These consumers had decided to assess the effectiveness of dietary supplements through personal study and subjective experimentation and not discuss this experimentation with their doctors. A similar lack of communication regarding CAM has been found between cancer patients and their physicians. For example, in a survey of women with breast cancer, Adler and Fosket [76] found that the majority of respondents (55 to 85 percent) used CAM therapies but did not divulge this use to their physicians because they assumed the physicians would not be interested, would respond negatively, would not understand, or would dominate the conversation due to assumed disinterest. Another survey found that physicians were unaware of CAM usage by the majority (57 percent) of their patients [77]. These studies suggest that physicians and patients must become more knowledgeable about the potential benefits and harms of CAM approaches and treatments, and physicians and other conventional health professionals must make significant efforts to open the lines of communication with their patients about their use of CAM approaches and products. Recently, a major effort has been made to increase conventional physicians' awareness and understanding of CAM through educational programs. However, there is a great deal of variability in the content of these programs [58]. [Reference #58 refers to courses taught to medical students. The vast majority of these courses are of low-quality.] Although a few provide detailed information on potential CAM benefits and safety issues, most are too general in content to provide physicians with the knowledge base they need to feel more comfortable about the subject and to display a willingness to discuss CAM issues with their patients. [In other words, most of the \"CAM\" courses taught at medical schools are worthless.] Concerns about the safety of CAM products and their interaction take place in the context of the larger public attention to the side effects and problems accompanying all medical treatment [78]. Future Prospects of CAM Despite the increasing use and acceptance of CAM and emerging evidence supporting efficacy of some CAM approaches and therapies, it is difficult to predict whether many CAM systems and practices will ever be fully integrated into the conventional health care system. Although a significantly greater degree of cooperation between specific CAM and conventional health care approaches and practitioners in the future, how well they can integrate their practices depends to a great measure on the establishment of an evidence-base for safety and effectiveness of CAM approaches as well as the success of a variety of ongoing pilot programs to test the efficacy and feasibility of integrative and collaborative models of CAM and conventional health care delivery. Models of Integration Over the past few years, a growing number of hospitals, major academic medical centers, managed care companies, and insurance carriers have become interested in integrating some aspects of CAM into their operations. [The primaty driving force has been economic rather than scientific.] According to the American Hospital Association [79], nearly 16 percent of America's community hospitals offered CAM services in 2000, up from about 11 percent in 1999. Furthermore, many major medical centers, particularly comprehensive care cancer centers such as M. D. Anderson in Houston, Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center and Columbia -Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, and Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, have begun integrating CAM services into all of their patient care [80]. [We doubt that \"CAM\" services are part of \"all\" patient care.] However, the development of integrative health care is still in its early stages and faces a number of challenges. Many of these approaches are still without an adequate scientific basis. [No, most of these practices have no scientific basis.] Even where there is evidence of benefit, the delivery of CAM in a conventional health care setting often requires significant reconfigurations of the way both the conventional and CAM health care services are structured, conceptualized, and delivered [82.83]. Another significant challenge facing integration is many CAM practitioners' belief that they would have to dramatically alter or water down their approach to practice in order to adapt to a physician-dominated system. Some CAM professions would prefer not to integrate if it means giving up their identity and independence [20]. Models of Collaboration Another model that is being tested in a number of conventional academic and CAM health care centers is collaborative model rather than an integrative one. This model does not require full integration of services but instead is based on conventional and CAM practitioners referring patients to one another within a clinic or network. The models that are currently being pilot tested range from having conventional and CAM practitioners working side-by-side as equals, collaborating both in the diagnosis and treatment of patient conditions [10], to having to physician-centered models, where CAM practitioners provide services independently but under the supervision of a primary or a specialty care physician [83]. These models, however, reveal additional challenges, which are listed below. Meeting Challenges As noted, many of these integrative and collaborative programs are in their infancy. As they grow and develop, they face a number of challenges, including addressing: - Difficulties in communicating and significant differences in worldviews and methods of diagnosing and treating illness and promoting health; - Certification and training standards for some CAM professions; - Insurance reimbursement for safe and effective CAM practices; - Appropriate research models; - Comprehensive information on CAM for both the lay public and health care practitioners; and, - Appropriate education of both conventional and CAM professionals about each other's disciplines at all stages of their training. [This falsely assumes that closer association would lead to greater acceptence of \"CAM practices.\" In the following chapters, the Commission discusses these and other challenges in depth and recommends strategies for addressing them at the national and state level. The ways in which individual practitioners and programs meet these challenges will help to shape the future of CAM practice and determine the access people have to CAM services.

[Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD, and Timothy N. Gorski, MD, FACOG]The public's increased use of complementary and alternative medicine has added urgency to the need to examine the safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices and products and to discover the basic mechanisms underlying them. [This sidesteps the fact that the underlying basis of many \"CAM\" methods is supernatural and delusional.] Basic, clinical, and health services research in CAM are all essential to the inclusion of CAM in the health care system. [It is correct, of course, that no practice should be permissible without evidence that it works or at least makes sense. However, the Commission deliberately fails to mention that research might also justify elimination of many popular methods.] Public and private funding for this research should be increased and the paucity of private investment in research on herbal and other CAM products popular with the public should be addressed. [Popularity should not be the primary factor in setting research priorities.] Rigorous research provides the information needed to increase the public's knowledge about CAM and to educate and train CAM and conventional health care professionals. It also provides a basis for regulating the quality and use of CAM products and devices as well as improving access to safe and effective CAM practices and products and health insurance coverage for them. [Again the Commission deliberately avoids mentioning that research might provide a basis for eliminating unsafe and ineffective nethods and that vigorous action should be taken to ban methods that are already known to be unsafe or ineffective.] In addition to questions of safety and efficacy, further studies should be undertaken to determine why people use CAM, how lifestyle and self-care affect health and disease, and how practitioner-patient interactions affect treatment outcomes. [Most of this is already known, but \"CAM\" advocates love these types of studies because they make headlines that encourage people to jump on the \"CAM\" bandwagon.\"] Research is also needed to pursue answers to questions posed by CAM that lie outside the conventional medical paradigm. [This refers to practices that are based on superstition and delusion. Rational people already know that they are senseless. It would be a waste of time and money to study these unless negative results would lead to banning them.] Establishing a strong scientific base in CAM is necessary for acceptance and inclusion of safe and effective CAM therapies in health care. [This falsely assumes that research would support a vast number of \"CAM\" practices and products.] In conventional medical practice, professional judgments are based on practitioners' training and experience and an accepted and expanding body of knowledge based on research findings published in peer-reviewed journals. Professional judgments in the practice of CAM are often not viewed in a similar light because of the lack of a sufficient body of evidence-based knowledge on which to form them. [That's only part of the story. Many \"CAM\" advocates have fixed beliefs that would not be influenced by contradictory information.] As the body of research literature in CAM expands, the professional judgments of trained and experienced CAM practitioners will be accepted more readily. [\"More readily\" implies that many \"CAM\" methods are being unfairly rejected because of \"bias\" rather than lack of evidence.] An important milestone toward the goal of increasing the body of evidence-based knowledge in CAM occurred in 1992 with the establishment of the Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The mandate of this office was to facilitate and coordinate CAM research and related projects with other NIH institutes, centers and offices, and to provide information to the public. In 1998, research in CAM took another major step forward when the Office of Alternative Medicine became, through congressional mandate, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). The expanded resources available to NCCAM enhanced its ability both to continue and build upon the work of the earlier office to provide the public with evidence on the safety and efficacy of CAM practices and products. [NCCAM has a few potentially useful studies under way. So far, however, it and its predecessors have not demonstrated that any \"CAM\" method works or doesn't work and should be embraced or abandoned.] Research Support and Scope Current CAM Research Activities The Commission commends NCCAM for its leadership and contributions to CAM research, methodology, training, and infrastructure development and supports increasing the center's crucial activities in these areas, including its database development and information dissemination responsibilities. NCCAM collaborates with NIH components, as well as other government agencies and non-government organizations. It initiates and funds research projects and establishes research centers at conventional medical institutions and CAM institutions. It also supports the training of CAM researchers and the research infrastructure at conventional and CAM institutions, supports educational activities, and offers opportunities for collaborations between CAM practitioners and researchers and mainstream investigators. The Commission commends current collaborations and encourages further collaboration between NCCAM and other Federal agencies, such as the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Health Research and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. The NIH Office of Dietary Supplements is also carrying out important work. The mandate of this office includes exploring the role of dietary supplements in the improvement of health care, promoting scientific study, and supporting conferences, workshops, and symposia, which it does in conjunction with NCCAM, other NIH institutes, centers, and offices, other government agencies, professional organizations, and public groups. The Commission also recognizes the support for CAM research by the other NIH components, encourages them to increase their valuable support, and notes especially the work of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the National Library of Medicine. In response to the public's use of CAM practices and products, overall NIH funding for research on CAM increased from $116.0 million in FY 1999 to an estimated $247.6 million in FY 2002. During the same period, funding by NCCAM increased from $48.9 million to an estimated $104.6 million. [The primary reason for NCCAM's funding increase is the support of Senator Tom Harkin, who has done more to promote quackery than any other Congressman in U.S. history.] Despite this increase, an analysis of NCCAM's extramural research trends between FY 1999 and FY 2003 indicates a growing number of applications and a decreasing number of new awards, resulting in a declining success rate, which is the percentage of research project grant applications that receive funding. Research project grants are awarded for an average of four years during which time they are considered non-competing grants. As an increasing number of quality CAM research applications are submitted and awarded, the number of non-competing grants to which funds are committed (the commitment base) grows. The increasing commitment base, which also may include some larger and longer-term clinical studies is a likely cause of the estimated decline in new awards. Therefore, in order to build the much needed evidence base for CAM, adequate funding is essential to support NCCAM's commitment base, grant renewals, and as many meritorious new awards as possible. Historically, as new NIH grant-awarding organizations move through budget allocation cycles and develop longer grant histories, they gradually improve the balance between non-competing and competing grants, but they are always aware of the need for adequate funding to support both. The Commission believes that NCCAM's budget increases should be sufficient to support growing numbers of awards to meet research needs and opportunities in crucial areas to ensure public health and safety. To help identify research needs and promising research opportunities, NCCAM, assisted by the Institute of Medicine, should develop guidelines for establishing research priorities in CAM. [Research priorities should be based on the likelihood of producing useful results and not on whether or not something is designated as \"CAM.\"] Because of the diversity of CAM systems and practices and the wide range and fluidity of opinions on the definition of what constitutes complementary and alternative medicine, it is important also to address the issue of definition because the current ambiguity makes it difficult to set priorities for guiding the use of resources. [Since \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" are marketing terms intended to cause confusion, it is not possible to meaningfully define them.] Other Federal agencies with research or health care responsibilities need to take a more active role in developing programs to evaluate biomedical and health services aspects of CAM to ensure that CAM use by the public is safe and effective. Funding for these programs should be sufficient to accomplish this goal. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality together with NCCAM should develop ways to expand health services research in CAM and explore methodologies for conducting health services research in this area. Federal agencies should assess the scientific, clinical practice, and public needs regarding CAM that are relative to their missions, examine their portfolios, and develop funding strategies to address these needs. They should ensure that applicants are aware of any technical assistance available to them. Agencies might consider such activities as funding initiatives (requests for applications and proposals), establishing CAM-focused offices or centers, designating CAM-focused staff positions, and creating CAM advisory committees or ensuring the representation of qualified CAM professionals on such committees. [There seems to be no limit to the ways the Commission wants to promote \"CAM\" methods. Why not suggest passing a law to abolish logical thinking and science-based practices so \"CAM\" advocates will have fewer obstacles?] Public and Private Research Funding for CAM Products That May Not Be Patentable The funding of research on frequently used or promising dietary supplements and other natural products that may not be patentable is a public health need of paramount importance. This research is needed to determine whether the products are safe to use alone and with other CAM and non-CAM products, and whether they are effective. Research is also needed on the development of analytical methods for producing better quality products, as well as on CAM therapeutic devices that may not be patentable. This research requires substantial Federal support now and in the immediate future. Along with the need for public funding is the need for incentives to stimulate more private sector support in this area. Congress and the Executive Branch might consider incentives such as low interest loans, tax incentives, market exclusivity, and the resolution of intellectual property issues. Workshops supported by the public and private sectors should be convened to discuss the research that is needed, including discussions on funding issues and sources, and the research needed by regulatory agencies for the review and approval processes. Private companies should recognize how important clinical research, product quality and dependability, and accurate information are to the public's perception of CAM products. [It would be more important to strengthen the ability of government agencies to ban products and services that are already known to be unsafe, irrational, or ineffective.] Federal agencies need to develop outreach programs to inform manufacturers of CAM products and devices about the Federal research support available to private industry, such as the Small Business Innovative Research Grant (R43/44), the Small Business Technology Transfer Research Grant (R41/42), 1 and the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement [2]. The manufacturers of CAM products and devices should become acquainted with potential sources of funding and with the requirements they must meet to receive such funds. Federal agency staff members are available to assist applicants with protocol development and to help them understand the grant process. CAM's Emphasis on Health and the Whole Person Public interest in CAM has renewed awareness of and respect for the importance of the whole person in maintaining health and treating disease. [No study has shown that \"CAM\" practitioners actually do this.] Members of the public have expressed appreciation for the attention many CAM practitioners and disciplines give to wellness and health promotion, self-care, lifestyle, quality of life, behavior, and the combined role of mind, body, and spirituality in health, disease, and healing. People also appreciate the importance many CAM practitioners and disciplines place on the interactions between patient and practitioner and on individualizing treatments. CAM's emphasis on the individual's biochemical uniqueness [3] and the value of tailoring treatments to the biological, psychological, sociological and spiritual aspects of the person, reinforces the need to increase studies on individualized CAM treatments and the variations in patients' responses to conventional medical treatments. [Although many \"CAM\" practitioners claim to do this, much of what they do has no rational basis.] Research in these areas, which converges with conventional behavioral and psychosocial research, may contribute in important ways to health care, particularly in rehabilitation and the management of chronic diseases and disorders, and merits increased public and private investment. Treatments, such as biofeedback, meditation, guided imagery, art therapy and music therapy, which appear to be effective but may not be profitable to private investors, should also receive Federal support. [These methods may help people relaxed and helps take their mind of their symptoms. They do not deserve high research priority.] In addition, research on 1) the synergistic activities of complex compounds and mixtures frequently found in CAM products; 2) clinical interventions consisting of multiple, combined treatments; 3) how patient-practitioner interactions affect treatment outcomes; and 4) the individualization of treatments should be supported by the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic medicine are examples of systems of practice that target specific conditions and might provide interesting and worthwhile research avenues to follow in studying some of these areas. [These Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda involve nonsensical diagnostic methods and treatment of nonexistent \"energy imbalances.\" These warrant no further study. Some of the herbal concoctions they utilize might be worth investigating to see whether they contain any useful ingredients.] Pluralism in Research Approaches and Quality in Research Methodology Various research approaches, if pertinent to the CAM question being asked, contribute to developing evidence of safety and clinical efficacy, understanding basic mechanisms of action underlying practices and products, and evaluating general effectiveness in the health-care system. Among these approaches are basic research, randomized controlled clinical trials, non-randomized studies, empirical observation, case studies, evaluations of practice-based data, and practice-based outcomes research. Also included are epidemiological and surveillance studies, behavioral and quality-of-life studies, qualitative research, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit studies, population and utilization studies, studies on health care delivery, and health care demonstration projects on various aspects of CAM use and services. To be methodologically sound, CAM studies must have a clear question (hypothesis), a sound study design, a qualified and appropriately constituted research team, objective and verifiable data, carefully defined outcome measures, and balanced conclusions that meet acceptable standards of evidence. The randomized controlled clinical trial is recognized as the gold standard for examining many clinical questions. Because of the complexity and uniqueness of illness and CAM approaches to illness, it may be necessary to adapt clinical trial methodology, in a flexible, step-wise fashion, to the unique characteristics of CAM questions and systems of care, while complying with protections for human subjects and institutional review board (IRB) guidelines. Questions of standardization and non-standardization, individualization and generalization, blinding, randomization, the placebo effect, compound mixtures, and many other research methodology challenges need to be resolved within the context of the study question and design and the overall research strategy. [This bypasses the question of the extent to which \"CAM\" methods are worth sturying. Those that have an irrational basis are not.] It is important to note that investigators in conventional clinical research have also adapted methodology and design to meet the needs of a study. Scientists have always followed their quests for knowledge by developing new ways to answer difficult questions, and pluralism in research design will allow scientists to develop innovative methods to examine complex CAM questions [4]. Funding mechanisms that have promoted interdisciplinary exchange of ideas in addressing difficult research questions in conventional research may offer settings in which creative ways of approaching difficult CAM research questions can be developed. Examples of such mechanisms include Specialized Center Awards (P50), Exploratory Grants (P20), and Center Core Grants (P30). Other awards of interest are the Exploratory/Developmental Grants (R21), which encourage the development of new research activities in categorical program areas, and the James A. Shannon Director's Award (R55), which is a limited grant mechanism for developing, testing, and defining research techniques and the feasibility of innovative, creative, research approaches [5]. In addition, multidisciplinary conferences, workshops, and expert panels, such as the CAM cancer symptom management research panel convened in November 2001, provide effective forums for exploring ways to address CAM research-related issues and challenges. The results of meetings such as these are often published in peer-reviewed journals and can stimulate new research and public and private investment. [The standards for studying \"CAM\" methods should be the same as those for studying any other method.] Exploring Whole Systems Concepts and Expanding Areas of Scientific Inquiry In addition to the primary task of identifying practices and products that could become complementary to conventional care or possibly alternative treatments, CAM research may go beyond isolated treatments and contribute innovative ideas to emerging areas of science that might help expand our understanding of health, disease, and healing. [This is wishful thinking. It hasn't happened yet, and there is no logical reason to think it will.] The CAM research spectrum is broad. It includes areas that in some cases may be almost indistinguishable from conventional medicine except for pharmacological agents, techniques, or application, such as exercise/diet/lifestyle therapies, herbal/nutritional supplements, behavioral/mind-body methods, pain management, the effects of culture on health and treatment, and the ability of the body to heal. [The meaning of this sentence is unclear.] The spectrum also includes areas that may receive less attention but are, or are becoming, areas of interest to conventional science, such as increasing our understanding of complete biological systems and how they interact, the placebo effect, spirituality, consciousness, and electromagnetic fields. Finally, the spectrum includes areas that challenge current biological and scientific concepts and assumptions, such as homeopathy, bioenergy (vital force; e.g., Qi, prana), bioelectromagnetic therapy, and therapeutic prayer. [They postulate supernatural \"healing forces\" that cannot be measured and, for practical purposes, can be considered nonexistent and not worthy of government-funded study.] Answers to some of these and other research questions posed by such CAM concepts may be found in the study of Ayurvedic medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tibetan medicine, Native American medicine, medicine of Africa, Latin American and Caribbean medicine, as well as naturopathic medicine, chiropractic, and other systems of healing. Applying rigorous scientific methods to the exploration of such frontier areas of inquiry may require merging whole system concepts with objective measurements used in research. It will also require the input of CAM professionals working with experts in a wide variety of fields, including but not limited to physics, cell and molecular biology, genetics, immunology, physiology, chemistry, neurobiology, epidemiology, psychology, sociology, and engineering. In addition to NCCAM, which has issued a request for applications to foster research in frontier areas of inquiry, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and the National Science Foundation are examples of Federal organizations that should consider contributing collaboratively or independently to the support of research on core CAM questions in areas described in many CAM systems. [This appears to be a call for many government agencies to devise ways to modify their standards and develop techniques so that methods that are patently ridiculous can be given high-priority research status.] Moving Non-approved Treatments to Clinical Investigation Physicians and other health care practitioners who believe they have promising data on non-approved CAM treatments need more assistance in moving successfully to clinical investigation of the treatment while meeting their professional, ethical, and human subject protection responsibilities. It is essential to note here that, in addition to Federal requirements concerning research, all CAM and conventional practitioners, whether or not they are engaged in research, must meet whatever State practice requirements or standards govern their authorization to practice. [There is no reason to modify accepted researcyh standards merely because methods are labeled as \"CAM.\" In CAM research, as in conventional research, the following standards apply: 1) the practitioner engaging in research must be knowledgeable about the collection of objective and valid observational data and record keeping; 2) the investigation of the treatment must be part of a well designed study that meets rigorous scientific standards; and 3) protections for human subjects and IRB guidelines must be in place and followed. Practitioners, however, often do not have the expertise, the resources, or the time to conduct high-quality, scientifically rigorous practice-based research. They need both the support of research institutions and the opportunity to collaborate with expert researchers in evaluating their observations and in designing and implementing clinical studies. [There is no logical reason to believe that special training for CAM advocates is likely to be a good investment. Nor would it make sense to promote the careers of people who want to test implausible hypotheses.] To help implement and accelerate the process, NIH and other Federal agencies, as appropriate, should develop programs to evaluate practice-based observational data as the basis for potential research support and communicate the availability of such programs to practitioners. If a project merits funding, CAM practitioners and CAM-trained researchers should be part of the research team. These programs may also offer training in data collection, the scientific method, protocol development, and ethical guidelines and human subject protection. Support for research can be obtained as well from reputable, high-quality private or nonprofit institutions or organizations, which could develop ways to assist practitioners in moving successfully from preliminary data to quality clinical research. The NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine conducts reviews of practice-based data through its best-case series program. Members of the Cancer Advisory Panel for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAPCAM), medical oncologists, and CAM experts also provide NCCAM with a field investigation function to collect and evaluate outcomes data on promising complementary and alternative cancer therapies. To stimulate practitioner response, NCCAM in collaboration with NCI, has called for the submission of case histories through notices in leading conventional and CAM periodicals, with letters, and at meetings. This effort has resulted in one study under way, another under negotiation, and a third under review. NCCAM has also, through the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, contracted with the RAND Corporation to compile data histories of best-case studies for review and assessment by CAPCAM. NCCAM has also explored a pilot project with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop methods for identifying practitioners who have data on new therapies and to conduct systematic reviews of the case files and identify practices worthy of research support. [NCCAM and its predecessors have supposedly been doing this for years and have nothing to show for it.] Using both the NCI best-case series and the NCCAM collaboration with NCI as a model, concerted efforts are needed to continue strengthening existing outreach activities to CAM practitioners and conventional researchers and to create outreach programs for evaluating practice-based observational data in additional areas of research. Activities should also offer guidance and training to facilitate the move by CAM professionals from promising preliminary data to scientifically rigorous clinical studies. [This falsely assumes that the process is likely to find promising treatments and that the people who run quack cancer clinics will provide honest reports.] Recommendation 1: Federal agencies should receive increased funding for clinical, basic, and health services research on CAM. Actions |1.1||Federal agencies should increase their activities with respect to CAM in accordance with their biomedical research, health services research, or other health care-related responsibilities and make these activities, including available technical assistance, known to CAM and conventional researchers and practitioners. Activities might include funding initiatives such as requests for applications and proposals; CAM-focused offices or centers; CAM-focused staff positions; CAM advisory committees or the representation of qualified CAM professionals on such committees. [Research priorities should depend on the likelihood that projects will yield significant results and not on whether or not they are marketed as \"CAM.\"]| |1.2||Federal agencies should assess the scope of scientific, practice, and public interest and needs regarding CAM that are relative to their missions, examine their portfolios, and develop funding distribution strategies to address these interests and needs. [Since \"public interest\" is not necessarily related to effectiveness, it should not be a major factor in determining research priorities.]| |1.3||The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality together with The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine should develop ways to expand health services research in CAM and explore methodologies for health services research in this area. [NCCAM and its predecessors have produced no significant findings during its ten years of existence. It makes more sense to abolish it than to increase its funding.]| |1.4||The Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support more research on (1) complex compounds/mixtures frequently found in CAM products, (2) clinical interventions consisting of multiple treatments, (3) how patient-practitioner interactions affect treatment outcomes, and (4) individualizing treatments. [Identifying the active ingredients of promising herbs is a worthwhile endeavor that has been taking place for decades. But this recommendation also supports clinical research on crude extracts (chemical mixtures) that is likely to be unproductive. It might also be useful to study patient-practitioner interactions. However, research expenditures and other incentives should be proportional to probable value, not whether something is labeled \"CAM.\"]| |1.5||n order to protect public health and maximize benefits, Congress should provide adequate public funding for research on frequently used or promising CAM products that would be unlikely to receive private research support. [This falsely implies that their are many promising \"CAM\" products. Frequency use should be considered only if a product appears to be effective.]| |1.6||The Federal government should support research on CAM practices that appear to be effective but may not be profitable to private investors, such as biofeedback, meditation, guided imagery, art therapy, and music therapy. [Research priority should be related to the probability of obtaining useful results, not according to whether something is marketed as \"CAM.\"]| Recommendation 2: Congress and the Administration should consider legislative and administrative incentives to stimulate private sector investment on research on CAM products that may not be patentable. Actions |2.1||Incentives to stimulate private sector investment in CAM research should focus on (1) research on dietary supplements and other natural products that may not be patentable; (2) research on other CAM products that may not be patentable, including therapeutic devices; and (3) the development of analytical methods for producing better quality CAM products. [Research priority should be related to the likelihood of useful results and not to whether products are classified as \"CAM.\"| |2.2||The Federal and private sectors should provide support for workshops to discuss the research needed by regulatory agencies for their review and approval processes for CAM products and devices. [This recommendation puts the cart before the horse. CAM advocates do not need special training in how to get things approved. Regulatory approval is based on proof of safety and effectiveness. Whether methods are standard or are labeled \"CAM\" is not relevant. What counts is whether or not they work.]| |2.3||Federal agencies should develop outreach programs to inform manufacturers of CAM products and devices about the Federal research support available to private industry and how the agency can assist them.| Recommendation 3: Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support research on CAM modalities and approaches that are designed to improve self-care and behaviors that promote wellness. [Research priorities should be determined by the likelihood of useful findings and not whether they are identified as \"CAM.\" Proven self-care and wellness strategies are part of mainstream public health and should not be identified as \"CAM.\"] Recommendation 4: Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support innovative research on core questions posed by CAM in frontier areas of scientific study that might expand our understanding of health and disease. Actions |4.1||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, assisted by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, should develop guidelines for establishing research priorities in CAM . [NCCAM has supposedly been doing this for many years.]| |4.2||The National Science Foundation, in collaboration with The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, should examine frontier areas of science associated with CAM that are outside the current research paradigm and methodological approaches to study them. [This falsely assumes that that \"frontier areas of science associated with CAM\" are rational but cannot be tested by established research methods. This appears to include alleged supernatural forces such as\"electromagnetic energy flow\" that cannot be measured with scientific instruments.]| |4.3||Multidisciplinary workshops and expert panels should be convened by Federal, private and nonprofit organizations, collaboratively or independently, to explore the challenges in design and methodology presented by research questions in CAM areas that are outside the current research paradigm. [The fact that quack methods cannot be substantiated does not mean that science-based standards of evidence should be lowered.]| |4.4||The National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense are among the Federal organizations that should consider contributing collaboratively or independently to the support of research on core questions in areas described in many CAM systems. [This is a blatant pitch for more research funds for studying methods marketed as \"CAM.\" Research dollars should be allocated according to potial usefulness rather than how they are designated.]| |4.5||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, working with the World Health Organization, should examine investigative approaches for studying the traditional systems of medical practice from a variety of cultures. [The study of folk healing is probably not a cost-effective way to discover new methods.]| Recommendation 5: Investigators engaged in research on CAM should ensure that human subjects participating in clinical studies receive the same protections as are required in conventional medical research and to which they are entitled. Actions |5.1||Licensed practitioners using CAM systems and modalities who wish to conduct or collaborate in clinical research should follow the same requirements as in conventional medical research. They should develop, or partner with a research institution to develop, a scientifically valid research protocol and obtain Institutional Review Board approval to ensure that they meet accepted standards of ethical conduct and their responsibilities to protect human subjects. [These are standard operating procedures for scientific research.]| |5.2||Accredited CAM institutions and CAM professional organizations should establish Institutional Review Boards where possible, and guide their colleagues and members to utilize the Institutional Review Board process, which is required to conduct clinical research.| |5.3||Institutional Review Boards that review CAM research studies should include the expertise of qualified CAM professionals in the review.| |5.4||Research institutions, National Institutes of Health Institutes and Centers, and other Federal research and health care agencies should be more proactive in developing programs that (1) provide opportunities for expert review of promising CAM practice-based observational data by experienced researchers, (2) stimulate practitioner response to the opportunities offered by the programs and (3) facilitate communication and stimulate partnerships between CAM practitioners and conventionally-trained researchers in designing and implementing clinical studies.| Recommendation 6: The Commission recommends that State professional regulatory bodies include language in their guidelines stating that licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized practitioners who are engaged in research on CAM will not be sanctioned solely because they are engaged in such research if they: 1) are engaged in well-designed research that is approved by an appropriately constituted IRB, 2) are following the requirements for the protection of human subjects, and 3) are meeting their professional and ethical responsibilities. All CAM and conventional practitioners, whether or not they are engaged in research, must meet whatever State practice requirements or standards govern their authorization to practice. [This proposal, if implemented, would enable practitioners of quack methods to escape rstate egulatory action by setting up their own Institutional Review Boards.] Dialogue, Partnerships, and Public Input Emerging Dialogue and Collaboration between CAM and Conventional Medicine Largely in response to the public's use of CAM practices and products, an emerging dialogue between CAM and conventional medicine appears to be taking place, along with a growing willingness to study CAM and experiment with its inclusion in health care [5]. This gradual change, which presents an exciting and hopeful prospect for meaningful collaborations, is reflected in an increase in cooperation and opportunities for cooperation between CAM and conventional health care professionals and institutions. A major challenge facing both CAM and conventional medicine is to foster this emerging dialogue and, by doing so, increase mutual respect and better understanding of one another's expertise, concerns, and contributions. Strengthening the dialogue will not only help protect the public from unsafe treatments, but will also expand opportunities to improve health care. A recent national survey indicates that most people who use CAM value both CAM and conventional approaches [6]. [The survey didn't determine whether the \"CAM\" approaches were valuable. It just determined that they had been used.] The goal of integrative medicine is to identify the most appropriate treatments available from a broad spectrum of evidence-supported care [7]. [This description is marketing hype. There is good reason to believe that it is inaccurate.] To name just a few examples, in integrative cancer treatment, a patient may undergo individualized acupuncture treatment for nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy [expensive and not proven cost-effective]; relaxation techniques and support groups [used decades before the \"CAM\" concept was popularized] are used with cancer patients to reduce stress, improve mood, and enhance the immune system; and mind-body interactions and stress management are being studied with respect to the treatment of hypertension and coronary heart disease. [The claim that psychological techniques enhance the immune system is a flat lie. Moreover, cancer is not a disease of the immune system.] The Commission supports collaboration between CAM and conventional medicine and believes that combining the best of CAM with conventional medical care may help reunite the art and science of medicine. [There are no data and no logical reason to believe that \"CAM\" approaches are more humane.] Applying the Same Standards It is the view of some CAM professionals that the requirements for CAM research are higher than for conventional research. [The corect way to express this is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.] On the other hand, some representatives of the conventional medical research community have expressed the belief that CAM research often is not held to as high a standard as conventional research. [The correct way to say this would be that CAM research is rarely high-quality and that CAM advocates don't seem to mind.] The Commission's position is that the same high standards of quality, rigor, and ethics must be met in both CAM and conventional medical research, research training, publication of research results in scientific and medical journals, presentations at research conferences, and review of products and devices. [If \"CAM\" research were high quality and lack of effectiveness would lead to abandonment of ineffective methods, the \"CAM\" community would be decimated. Note carefully, however, that the WHCCAMP report does not contain a single sentence stating conditions under which any \"CAM\" practice should be disgarded.] Cooperation and Partnerships Cooperation and partnerships are at the heart of the challenge to foster dialogue and improve the quality of CAM research and the success of research applications, including those that may lie outside mainstream research. Building working relationships among professionals from conventional medical, allied health, and CAM disciplines is essential to progress in studying CAM practices and products. The absence of these relationships impedes progress in building knowledge about CAM and establishing the appropriate use of CAM within the health care system. [There is no reason why genuine scientists should affiliatiate with screwballs.] To be most effective, CAM and conventional researchers, clinicians, practitioners, and the leadership of their institutions and organizations need to communicate with one another and form working relationships. Federal and State research and health care agencies, the private and nonprofit sectors, and the public are also integral to this cooperative environment that gives the scientific and health care community an opportunity to raise the quality of CAM research and improve the research infrastructure. [This assumes that \"CAM\" methods hold sufficient promise to warrant such affiliations.] The effective regulation of CAM research, the publication of CAM research results, and the review and approval of CAM practices and products also depend on increased interaction among these various constituencies. [Regulation is ultimately in the hands of legislators who care more about being re-elected than about upholding scientific practice. The assumption that research will lead to more effective regulation is dead wrong.] Therefore trained, experienced, and properly qualified CAM and conventional medical professionals need to be represented on research, journal, regulatory, and health insurance review and advisory committees, as well as in discussions on CAM-related research policy issues. [Insurance companies don't need \"CAM\" practitioners to help them determine what services to cover. The relevant consideration is whether a practice has been proven safe and effective for intended purposes. The scientific community does not need help from \"CAM\" advocates to interpret scientific studies.] Because conferences, workshops, and expert panels are excellent instruments for enhancing communication, participants at such meetings should include CAM and conventional medical and health care professionals and the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. As stated earlier, multidisciplinary meetings offer the opportunity for people from a broad variety of disciplines and interests to build on each others' knowledge and experience in discussions about promising research topics and research planning, program development, and policy considerations, and to explore innovative methodological approaches to solving difficult research questions in focused CAM areas. [This falsely assumes that \"CAM\" advocates have something extraordinarily useful to offer.] Examples of interdisciplinary activities that have contributed to progress in CAM include the conference on \"Exploring Opportunities for Collaboration with Industry\" supported by NCCAM, the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation's \"Conference on the Education of Health Professionals in Complementary/Alternative Medicine,\" the conference on \"Building Bridges: the Link between Allopathic and Alternative Medicine in Clinical Practice and Research\" sponsored by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and School of Hygiene and Public Health and the Traditional Acupuncture Institute, and the Center for Mind-Body Medicine's \"Comprehensive Cancer Care Conference\" cosponsored by NCI and The symposia and conferences on \"Complementary, Alternative and Integrative Medical Research\" sponsored by the Harvard Medical School, Division of Research and Education in Complementary and Integrative Medical Therapies are another example of this type of activity. Federal public health grants for conference support, such as the R13, H13, and T14 [8], are available to qualified applicants. [The question could be asked whether these conferences accomplished anything beyond enabling \"CAM\" advocates from trumpeting the fact that they participated in conferences with prominent sponsors.] Partnerships and collaborations between and among public, private, and nonprofit organizations are also very important to the support of CAM research. Interested nonprofit organizations should consider pooling their resources, independently or collaboratively with the public or private sectors, to support interdisciplinary conferences on CAM research, as well as to support CAM research, research infrastructure and training at CAM institutions, and the dissemination of CAM information. [There is no logical reason to believe that collaboration, special funding, or special training for CAM advocates are likely to be good investments. Nor would it make sense to promote the careers of people who want to test implausible hypotheses. The best \"training program\" is a solid education in the sciences.] Public Input and Public Use The public's growing influence on the health care system has created a need for more research, including population-based research on why people are turning to CAM, as well as a need to ensure public participation in shaping the direction of CAM research. [Public views are shaped largely by advertising and marketing rather than effectiveness. In its 1998 report, Scientific Opportunities and Public Needs, the Institute of Medicine described public input as an essential and integral part of the democratic process, which if done well, can improve the knowledge base for public policy decisions. The report goes on to recognize the intense public interest in health issues, and agreement on the part of the public, Congress and the Executive Branch that investing in research is the right thing to do [9]. [Research priorities should be based on the likelihood of benefit. While public interest should influence where research dollars go, medical scientists themselves are in the best position to determine which methods \u2014 among a huge number of possibilities \u2014 are most likely to yield important and useful results by doing rigorous scientific studies. The best \"public representatives\" are scientists who have had high-quality training.] Federal requirements and opportunities for public participation in the shaping of health care research and related activities currently exist. Examples include the NIH Director's Council of Public Representatives, which was recommended by the Institute of Medicine, and the long standing requirement that there be public members on NIH advisory councils, boards, and committees, Food and Drug Administration advisory committees, and IRBs [10]. Such opportunities are available to members of the public representing CAM research and related areas. Public members of Federal advisory committees as well as the agencies they advise would gain from programs designed to orient and train them on how to provide their input most effectively, particularly with regard to 1) moving from promising basic science findings to clinical treatments, 2) identifying health services research needs, and 3) improving the dissemination of research information. Because of the increased use of CAM products and the published reports of adverse events, including loss of therapeutic drug effectiveness and compromised perioperative care, the NIH Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center established a policy in June 2001 requiring that all inpatients and outpatients be asked, during the admission process, about their use of herbal or other dietary supplements. There is also a growing trend to include questions about herbal or other dietary supplement use in research protocols. The possibility of including such questions in all NIH Clinical Center IRB protocols is being considered. The knowledge gained from this questioning would benefit research subjects and future protocol development by contributing important information about the use of dietary supplements and other natural products [11]. The collection of such information may in the future also offer a data source for research on consumer use of CAM. Because reliable information, including patient disclosure, is necessary to ensure informed decision making, patient safety and valid research outcomes, it is once again clear that 1) more research is needed on CAM practices and products and 2) health care professionals and researchers need to be knowledgeable about CAM. Recommendation 7: Increased efforts should be made to strengthen the emerging dialogue among CAM and conventional medical allied health practitioners, researchers and accredited research institutions; Federal and State research, health care, and regulatory agencies; the private and nonprofit sectors; and the general public. Actions |7.1||CAM and conventional medical researchers and practitioners should adhere to the same high standards of quality and ethics in all aspects of research and related activities. [This is self-evident but exaggerates the likelihood that \"CAM\" researchers and practitioners can achieve high standards of quality and ethics.]| |7.2||Federal agencies should develop programs to stimulate cooperation and partnerships between CAM and conventional medical professionals and accredited institutions. [This exaggerates the likelihood that \"CAM\" practitioners can enter into useful partnerships with science-based practitioners and their institutions.]| |7.3||Committees reviewing or advising on research, journal submissions, regulatory compliance, and health insurance coverage in both the public and private sectors should include as members or consultants trained, experienced, and properly qualified CAM health care professionals. [This falsely implies that many \"properly qualified CAM health professionals\" exist. TMoreover, the choice of experts should be based on the quality of their work rather than how they label and market themselves.]| |7.4||Multidisciplinary conferences, workshops, and expert panels on CAM research and related activities, including research methodology, should be supported independently or collaboratively by the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. [Such intermingling would have political value for \"CAM\" proponents but is unlikely to add to scientific knowledge.]| |7.5||The nonprofit sector and the private sector should create funding partnerships, whether independently or with Federal agencies, to augment support for CAM research, research infrastructure and training, research conferences, and information dissemination. [Nonprofit and private organizations can give money to whomever they please. Allocation of government funds should be based on scientific standards, not how methods are classified.]| |7.6||The Federal government should support research, including population-based research, to learn more about why people use CAM practices and products, how they determine the safety and effectiveness of the practices and products they use, and what they find satisfying or unsatisfying about them. [If done properly, research of this type could be used to educate people on how to avoid being quacked. But the statistics could also be used to promote irrational methods by trumpeting about how popular they are.]| |7.7||To benefit patients and future research protocol development and to add to our knowledge about the use of CAM, Institutional Review Boards should consider requiring that all research subjects be asked about their use of herbal or other dietary supplements. [This might be important if using dietary supplements or herbs could confound the data. But routine questioning might convey an underlying message that the products are so important that they deserve special consideration.]| |7.8||Federal agencies supporting biomedical and health services research should develop orientation and training programs for public representatives to enhance the effectiveness of their participation on advisory committees concerned with CAM. [It does not make sense to train people whose judgment is so poor that they advocate wildly implausible hypotheses.]| Research Training and Infrastructure A strong research infrastructure is crucial to training skilled investigators to study CAM questions, producing grant applications in CAM that successfully compete for support, and conducting rigorous CAM research. Sustained, adequate funding is essential to building and maintaining a long-term research capacity for training clinical investigators and health services researchers in CAM, and for training scientists who are interested in studying the underlying mechanisms of CAM products, practices, systems and concepts. A government-wide effort involving NIH, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs and other Federal agencies would strengthen the funding and strategic planning for developing or enhancing CAM research sites and training programs. Supporting research training and infrastructure in accredited CAM institutions would help build their capability to conduct high quality research and enhance their opportunities to form research collaborations with conventional medical research centers. Accredited CAM and conventional medical institutions might consider developing joint research and professional education and training programs to enhance the quality and clinical relevance of CAM research and link the research with evidence-based education and training of practitioners. [This calls for politicization of all medical research. Research dollars should be used to study which methods \u2014 among a huge number of possibilities \u2014 are most likely to yield important and useful results. The best \"training program\" is a solid education in the sciences.] The Need for Rigorous Training The same rigorous training is required for both CAM and conventional medical researchers and must be available to both. Conventional researchers need to understand CAM concepts and approaches, and both CAM and conventional investigators must have thorough training in the fundamental elements of quality clinical, basic, or health services research. Training should include a strong grounding in 1) the research process and methodology, 2) the collection and recording of unbiased data, 3) all aspects of protocol or study design and execution, 4) an understanding of the expertise needed to form a research team, 5) IRB and other regulatory requirements, and 6) the grant application, submission, and review processes. [Appropriate training in scientific methods is widely available at academic centers throughout the world. There is certainly no good reason to train people just because they label themselves as CAM practitioners.] Research training in CAM should also teach multiple outcomes measures, including social and biopsychological measures of health, and offer experience working as part of a multdisciplinary research team. The opportunity to gain solid training in a supportive environment on how to conduct quality research in CAM should continue to attract students from both CAM and conventional medicine who are interested in studying CAM questions. In addition, all Federal agencies that have training programs as part of their health care missions should support the training of researchers to address CAM-related questions that are relevant to their missions. Elements of a Strong Research Infrastructure Research sites, whether supported publicly, privately, or by foundations, need to be strategically located and structured to conduct basic, clinical, and health services research, adequately train researchers and clinical experts, and deliver integrated care services. The success of each site depends on a critical mass of personnel, equipment, basic and clinical research expertise, core laboratory facilities, and clinical environments with access to patients. CAM research sites should be developed at public, private and accredited CAM institutions with both CAM-trained and conventional medical professionals serving on faculty or as consultants and with experienced researchers serving as mentors. Cooperation between CAM and conventional medical researchers and institutions and joint research grant applications can contribute to success in obtaining funding. Current Research and Research Training Activities and Opportunities Academic health centers at conventional institutions offer excellent venues for exchanging experiences with CAM professionals on how best to educate conventional researchers in CAM practices and how to introduce CAM practitioners to the conventional research culture. Conventional health centers are gradually including CAM in their research, research training, clinical, and medical education activities. For example, the Medical Center Health System of the University of Pennsylvania, recognizing that CAM therapies merit evaluation, recently reviewed the role of CAM in the medical center and health system and is beginning to incorporate the study of CAM therapies into its research, clinical, research training and educational activities, including stimulating interdisciplinary collaboration [12]. Harvard University, Duke University, the University of Maryland, the University of Oregon, the University of Washington, Georgetown University, and many other institutions across the country have incorporated CAM into their academic health centers; each has done so in its own way. Some conventional health centers have cooperative arrangements with CAM institutions and such cooperation should be encouraged. [One reason for the \"incorporation\" has been the availabilty of funding from NCCAM. Whether anything useful results from the process remains to be seen.] Accredited CAM institutions are gradually expanding their activities to develop research and research training capacity, form interdisciplinary collaborations, and establish cooperative arrangements with conventional health centers. For example, a neurophysiology laboratory focusing on research of interest to the chiropractic field has been established at the Parker College of Chiropractic by a conventionally trained neurophysiologist. NCCAM has awarded grants to CAM institutions, such as the Bastyr University Naturopathic Medicine Program, the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine, the Center for Natural Medicine and Prevention of the Maharishi University of Management, and to a consortium of chiropractic colleges. The number of accredited CAM institutions that receive research support should increase as their capacity to conduct rigorous research improves and they submit more applications. [The number of accredited \"CAM\" institutions doing research is not large. Whether any of them will generate useful findings remains to be seen.] NCCAM provides funding for approximately 15 CAM Specialty Centers of Research in collaboration with other NIH institutes and centers and the Office of Dietary Supplements. In addition to botanicals, the specialty centers focus on such areas as arthritis, women's health, pediatrics, cardiovascular disease, addiction, cancer, and craniofacial disorders. These Centers as well as others supported by NCCAM offer research training opportunities. NCCAM and the other institutes and centers are encouraged to develop a cadre of well-trained CAM and conventional medical investigators in basic, clinical, or health services CAM research and to support career development awards. The Commission also encourages support of CAM research training and infrastructure by the private and nonprofit sectors. The General Clinical Research Centers, supported by the NIH National Center for Research Resources, form a national network of hospital-based centers that provide a research infrastructure for clinical investigators who receive NIH and other Federal agency support, and an environment and resources for developing future scientists in clinical research. In addition to the NCCAM-supported centers, the General Clinical Research Centers might offer opportunities to conduct clinical research and training in CAM and examine the inclusion of CAM in the clinical setting. [A few significanbt studies of individual hers are under way. Whether any of them will generate useful findings remains to be seen.] In addition to continued strong support for pre- and post-doctoral fellowship (F) and institutional (T) research training awards, CAM research trainees need experienced mentors. Incentives may have to be developed to attract mentors to this field. Strong support of career development (K) awards \u2014 including those that enable investigators focusing on CAM to develop into independent investigators and faculty members, and mid-career awards to provide the time required to mentor new CAM investigators \u2014 are of considerable importance [13]. Also, the NIH Loan Repayment Program is offered to individuals holding doctoral degrees who participate in clinical research. Among those who are eligible are, DCs, NDs, and OMDs [14]. Recommendation 8: Public and private resources should be increased to strengthen the infrastructure for CAM research and research training at conventional medical and CAM institutions and to expand the cadre of basic, clinical, and health services researchers who are knowledgeable about CAM and have received rigorous research training. Actions |8.1||Funding should be made available to accredited CAM and conventional medical institutions develop programs that examine CAM research questions and that stimulate cross-institutional collaborations involving faculty and students in research and research training.| |8.2||Funding should be made available to accredited CAM and conventional medical institutions support joint research and professional education and training programs to enhance the quality and clinical relevance of CAM research and link the research with evidence-based education and training of practitioners. [This falsely assumes that training advocates of irrational practices will lead to valuable results. There is no logical reason to assume that it will. Moreover, CAM is a marketing term, not a genuine field of health care.]| |8.3||Federal health agencies with research training programs and responsibilities that encompass CAM-related questions should be given adequate support to increase research training in CAM. [This falsely assumes that training advocates of irrational practices will lead to valuable results. There is no logical reason to assume that it will. Moreover, CAM is a marketing term, not a genuine field of health care.]| |8.4||Existing resources, such as The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine-supported centers and the National Center for Research Resources' General Clinical Research Centers should be utilized to increase opportunities to conduct clinical research and training on CAM and examine the inclusion of CAM into the clinical setting. [Despite nearly ten years of distributing grant money, NCCAM and its predecessors have produced no useful clinical research findings. It makes no sense to increase their funding.]| |8.5||Federal support should be increased for career development awards, including those that enable investigators focusing on CAM to develop into independent investigators and faculty members, and mid-career awards that provide the time required to mentor new CAM investigators. [The basis for training career investigators should be the quality of their work, not whether they label or market themselves as \"CAM\" investigators.]| CAM Research Results: Systematic Reviews and Evaluations Publication of CAM Research Results in Peer-Reviewed Journals Publication of CAM research results in recognized, rigorously peer-reviewed research journals is needed to provide reliable information about CAM to researchers, practitioners, and ultimately the public. Decisions on regulating the use of and reimbursement for CAM therapies should be based on published evidence of safety (including toxicity, side effects, and adverse interactions), clinical efficacy, general effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses rather than on traditional use, anecdotal reports, consumer interest, and market demand. The quality of the research and the standards of review required for journal publication affect how readers determine the reliability and usefulness of the information. To ensure a fair and accurate review, both CAM and conventional medical and scientific expertise should be represented on journal review boards when reviewing CAM research submissions. Systematic Reviews Reviews of published research from sources such as the Cochrane Collaboration's collection of systematic reviews, the evidence-based reports developed by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, and the databases of the National Library of Medicine, such as PubMed and MedlinePlus, are valuable resources for scientists, research planners, practitioners, community health centers, policy makers, and the public. The Commission is pleased with these organizations' CAM-related activities, especially their efforts to cooperate with one another, and their collaborations with NCCAM. Efforts to increase the availability of concise and understandable summaries of the research literature for the public and other audiences through MedlinePlus and other dependable information sources should be supported. Examples that could be effectively applied to CAM-related information are the Department of Health and Human Services' \"Report of the U.S. Preventive Task Force Guide to Clinical Preventive Services,\" which is a complete assessment of the literature on preventive medicine, and the more recent British Medical Journal publication, Clinical Evidence, which regularly updates information on clinical evidence. [This falsely suggests that many \"CAM\" methods could be endorsed by prestigious review bodies.] Recommendation 9: Public and private resources should be used to support, conduct, and update systematic reviews of the peer-reviewed research literature on the safety, efficacy, and cost-benefits of CAM practices and products. Actions |9.1||The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality should expand its Evidence-based Practice Center systematic reviews on CAM systems and treatments for use by private and public entities in developing tools, such as practice guidelines, performance measures, and review criteria, and for identifying future research needs. [This falsely implies that current methods of scientific review are defective and that \"CAM\" methods should be reviewed differently.]| |9.2||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine should issue a comprehensive, understandable, and regularly updated summary of current clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of CAM systems and treatments for health care practitioners and the public. [Many such summaries have been published. Whether more would serve any useful purpose would depend on who compiles them and whether their conclusions are supported by scientific evidence. To date, neither NCCAM nor WHCCAMP has ever publicly concluded that any \"CAM\" method is worthless and should be abandoned. The call for dissemination of \"evidence\" attempts to conceal how little there is that is worth disseminating.]| References - National Institutes of Health, Office of Extramural Research.

Chapter 9: Coordinating Federal CAM Efforts[Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD, and Timothy N. Gorski, MD, FACOG]In the course of Commission meetings, it became clear that a wide cross-section of the population wants the Federal government to take the lead in integrating safe and effective complementary and alternative health care practices and products into the nation's health care system. Consumers, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and conventional practitioners, and product manufacturers testified about the need for a coordinated Federal effort to achieve this goal. This view is consistent with the findings of other groups as well. At the \"Second Annual Integrative Medicine Industry Leadership Summit,\" held in May 2001, a major recommendation was the establishment of a Federal office of CAM and integrative health care and the selection of an advisory committee to the office [1,2] Similarly, the creation of a Federal CAM/integrated health care office was a key recommendation of the \"National Policy Dialogue to Advance Integrated Health Care: Finding Common Ground\" held at Georgetown University in late 2001 [3]. [This paragraph reflects the views of \"CAM\" proponents whose views dominated the events described in this paragraph. It does not reflect \"a wide cross-section\" of theAmerican population, most of whom have never considered the matter.] Proper integration of safe and effective CAM practices and products into the nation's health care system will require an ongoing, coordinated Federal presence. The most effective means of accomplishing this goal is to establish a centralized office that would include the full range of CAM perspectives in the dialogues that guide policy formulation and implementation. Several possible locations of the office were proposed, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. If located in the White House, the new office could be either a freestanding entity in the Executive Office of the President, following the precedent of the Office of National AIDS Policy and the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, or it could be placed in an existing office, such as the Office of Domestic Policy. A White House location would provide an opportunity to influence Federal policy, but it would not provide a permanent presence in the Federal sector. If located in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the office could be created in the Secretary's Office of Public Health and Science (OPHS), following the lead of the Office of Minority Health and the Office on Women's Health, or it could be placed within one of the 13 existing program offices that make up the OPHS-in particular, the Office of the Surgeon General. Locating it under the Surgeon General could provide links to other important public health activities, such as Healthy People 2010. While a DHHS location would provide a permanent Federal presence, it would limit the office's influence mainly to DHHS policy. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is an example of effective Federal coordination of CAM research that evolved from an office established within DHHS. It began as the Office of Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes of Health with a $2 million budget in fiscal year 1992 and became a national research-coordinating center with a $104.6 million budget in fiscal year 2002. [Considering how little it has accomplished, it illustrates why settling up another federal agency to promote \"CAM\" is a poor idea.] The presence and focus of NCCAM in the Federal government has stimulated research well beyond the reach of its budget, with private and public organizations also contributing to increased efforts in CAM research, education, and practice in the United States and around the world. Office of Complementary and Alternative Health Care Coordination Three options for creating an office of complementary and alternative health care coordination are possible. First, the President could establish the office in the White House through an executive order. Second, the Secretary of Health and Human Services could establish the office in OPHS or one of its component program offices by an administrative action. Third, Congress could create the office and determine the most appropriate location through legislation, which would provide permanence, a legislative mandate, and budget appropriations. Responsibilities of the Office - Responsibilities should include the following: - Coordinating Federal CAM activities; - Serving as a Federal CAM policy liaison with conventional health care and CAM professionals, organizations, educational institutions, and commercial ventures; - Planning, facilitating, and convening conferences, workshops, and advisory groups; - Acting as a centralized Federal point of contact for CAM for the public, CAM practitioners, conventional health care providers, and the media; - Facilitating implementation of the recommendations and actions of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy; - Exploring additional and emerging topics not included in the Commission's Executive Order. Coordinating Federal CAM Activities Coordinating Federal CAM activities requires that the office be placed at the highest possible and most appropriate level in the Federal Government. If located in DHHS, the office would work closely with all DHHS Agencies in a manner similar to that of the minority health and women's health offices. For example, the new office would collaborate with NCCAM, the National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health, and other appropriate Federal Departments and Agencies. Once established, the office will need to coordinate CAM activities all Federal CAM activities. It should form a trans-departmental CAM coordinating committee that includes representation from all Federal Departments and Agencies to facilitate its mission. Because the extent of Federal CAM activities has not been identified fully, the office should conduct a baseline survey of activities, by collecting data through the trans-departmental committee. Results of the survey could form the basis for coordinating Federal CAM activities. Because of its value to the Secretary, Administration, and Congress, this type of report on Federal CAM activities could be generated periodically to assist in making ongoing policy decisions. Serving As a Federal CAM Policy Liaison Another significant role of the office would be to serve as a Federal CAM policy liaison with conventional health care and CAM professionals, organizations, educational institutions, and commercial ventures. These activities are described in the recommendations and actions in the Education and Training, Information Development and Dissemination, Wellness, Access and Delivery, Coverage and Reimbursement, and Coordination of Research chapters of this report. An important activity of the new office would be to establish an advisory council similar to NCCAM's. This group should bring together the various parties interested in CAM to develop a strategic plan that reflects public opinion. Therefore, the advisory council should include consumers and other members from outside the Federal government. The membership also should include the directors of NCCAM, the Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and the Office of Dietary Supplements. In addition, it should include representatives from the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Energy, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Food and Drug Administration, the White House Office of Domestic Policy, and other appropriate Federal entities. Planning, Facilitating, and Convening Conferences, Workshops, and Necessary Advisory Groups Public testimony stressed the importance of creating sustainable, collaborative environments in which issues of mutual concern to CAM and conventional health care can be raised, discussed, and resolved. The new office would bring together interested parties from CAM and conventional health care to design and undertake activities to meet the needs identified by the advisory council, the trans-departmental CAM coordinating committee, and the results of the survey of Federal CAM activities. By planning, facilitating, and convening conferences, workshops, and advisory groups, the new office would create unique opportunities to explore CAM issues, such as those involving product safety, licensure, or coverage and reimbursement. Acting as a Centralized Federal Point of Contact for CAM As a centralized Federal point of contact for CAM, the office would develop and implement a system to direct inquiries from the public, CAM practitioners, conventional health care providers, and the media to the appropriate person at the Departmental or Agency level. The office would carry out this responsibility through a network of information officers or other persons with known expertise. To transmit information readily to the public, CAM practitioners, and conventional health care providers, the office should create a website that includes information about the office and its responsibilities, a CAM events calendar, and links to Federal and other appropriate CAM websites. [Whether such information would be useful would depend upon who prepares and provides it. To date, federal agencies that have provided information about \"CAM\" practices have done a very poor job. So far, government-sponsored CAM information sources have been unwilling to identify which CAM methods are worthless and have failed to refer people to information sources that are justifiably critical of CAM methods. Setting up another agency with similar policies would worsen the situation rather than improve it.] Not everyone has access to the Internet, so information must be developed and made readily available to these consumers as well. Since NCCAM has a Congressional mandate \"to establish a clearinghouse to exchange information with the public about alternative medicine,\" the new office should not undertake activities that would duplicate NCCAM's. However, additional information is needed consumes if they are to make informed decisions about CAM. The office would collaborate with Federal Departments and Agencies and the private sector to develop reliable information for dissemination through the NCCAM clearinghouse and other means that are not dependent upon the Internet. [So far, NCCAM has provided almost no information about \"CAM\" that should be avoided. It has never, for example, categorized any \"CAM\" method as irrational.] Facilitating Implementation of Commission Recommendations and Actions Considerable time and resources were spent in soliciting specific recommendations from the public, and this advice helped form the basis of the Commission's recommendations and actions. However, without legislative authority, staff, and a budget, the likelihood of their being successfully implemented is diminished significantly. Therefore, one of the most important roles of the new office is to facilitate implementation of the Commission's recommendations and actions. [In other wrods, to set up an office that can lobby for more special privileges for methods marketed as \"CAM.\"] This role would include interactions with Administration officials, members of Congress and their staffs, and relevant Departments and Agencies. Particularly encouraging is language in the Conference Report that accompanied the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002 (Public Law 107-116), which urged the Secretary of Health and Human Services to form a coordinating unit to review the Commission's report and implement ways of improving coordination of the DHHS's many CAM-related activities. Exploring additional and emerging topics not included in the Commission's Executive Order Despite the comprehensive nature of the Commission's Executive Order, additional and emerging topics beyond the scope of this report will need to be addressed, and the new office would be in a position to do this. For example, the office could provide technical assistance on CAM to individual States when requested. Recommendation 29: The President, Secretary of Health and Human Services, or Congress should create an office to coordinate Federal CAM activities and to facilitate the integration into the nation's health care system of those complementary and alternative health care practices and products determined to be safe and effective. Actions |29.1||The office should be established at the highest possible and most appropriate level in the Department of Health and Human Services and should be given sufficient staff and budget to meet its responsibilities. [It would be absurd to create an \"office at the highest possible level\" to promote so-called CAM. Doing that would constitute a government endorsement of homeopathy, therapeutic touch, cranial osteopathy, rebirthing and many other preposterous practices that have been embraced by one or more members of Commission.]| |29.2||The office should charter an advisory council. Members should include CAM and conventional practitioners with expertise, diverse backgrounds, and necessary training, as well as representatives of both the private and public sectors, to guide and advise the office about its activities. [Previous advisory councils have been composed almost entirely of \"CAM\" advocates and have included few if any knowledgeable critics.]| |29.3||The office's responsibilities should include, but not be limited to, coordinating Federal CAM activities; serving as a Federal CAM policy liaison with conventional health care and CAM professionals, organizations, institutions, and commercial ventures; planning, facilitating, and convening conferences, workshops, and advisory groups; acting as a centralized Federal point of contact regarding CAM for the public, CAM practitioners, conventional health care providers, and the media; facilitating implementation of the Commission's recommendations and actions; and exploring additional and emerging topics not considered by the Commission.| References - Areas of agreement and proposed action among industry stakeholders.

The article contributed significantly to the recent explosion of interest in \"alternative medicine\" in the United States. The paper reports a telephone poll of 1539 people on their use of \"unconventional\" methods on the previous year. Until that time quackery and medical pseudoscience practices existed in a fringe subculture. This began to change around the time of this article's appearance and the report has become one of the most frequently cited articles in the medical literature. The lead author was David M Eisenberg, MD, whose chief publication up until this time had been a popular book on the wonders of traditional Chinese medicine entitled Encounters With Qi. The article began by acknowledging the difficulty of defining \"unconventional, alternative, or unorthodox therapies,\" referring to \"medical practices that are not in conformity with the standards of the medical community.\" This is a fairly satisfactory definition of \"alternative medicine\" if \"the standards of the medical community\" are understood to include methods that are truly effective or which are under appropriate and well-designed scientific investigation. But the Eisenberg article settled on a definition of \"unconventional medicine\" being those \"medical interventions not taught widely at U.S. medical schools or generally available at U.S. hospitals.\" It addressed the question of how widespread these methods are and how much money is spent on them in relation to medical care that is more or less in conformity with medical and scientific standards. The 1539 people interviewed were a subset of 2295 respondents who agreed to participate and actually finished the interview. The 2295 people were, in turn, found by calling 5158 telephone numbers and excluding more than half of them because they were not working, were \"not assigned to households,\" did not speak English, or were cognitively or physically impaired. But for the sake of argument and brevity, my comments leave aside the implications of these facts - that the survey was not representative of the population. The telephone polling began by asking respondents about 24 medical conditions. Only 8% of respondents offered other \"important conditions.\" The ten most frequently reported medical conditions listed by the Eisenberg survey are shown in Table 1 with, for comparison, figures from the Centers for Disease Control's Vital and Health Statistics, Prevalence of Selected Chronic Conditions 1990-92. |Medical Condition||From Table 3 of | Eisenberg Article. |CDC Vital and Health Statistics, Prevalence of Selected Chronic Conditions |\"Back |Chronic bronchitis||5.2%| The Eisenberg survey also asked about dizziness, diabetes, and cancer, but the rates of these disorders and 11 others that the 1539 respondents were asked about were not given in the article. Presumably they were less than 8%, although, as is shown, hearing problems, skin conditions, and heart disease in the general population are in this range of prevalence according to the CDC. Deafness, of course, was the condition that D.D. Palmer \"cured\" when he \"discovered\" chiropractic more than a hundred years ago. Notably absent from Eisenberg's data were common ailments such as colds, cough, and flu. Neither was there mention of obstetric or gynecologic disorders, which are probably the most common medical problems of reproductive aged women. Among women aged 18-44, for example, roughly the range in which Eisenberg reported the highest rate of use of \"unconventional medicine,\" the CDC reported the prevalence of menstrual disorders as 2.8%, bladder infections 1.4%, kidney infections 1%, and other disorders of the female genital tract at 3%. Taken together as genitourinary problems, and including pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications, these would almost surely total 8% or more. Yet they appear to have been excluded. Also absent was obesity, which is notable because commercial weight loss centers were included in \"unconventional medicine\" methods and were used by more respondents than the majority of other methods. As one of a variety of chronic medical conditions that has proven extraordinarily resistant to successful management by any means, obesity has been and continues to be a prime target for \"alternative medicine\" promoters. Its absence here is inexplicable. When the survey respondents were asked about their use of \"unconventional medicine\" and whether or not they had seen a practitioner or \"provider\" of same, the answers broke down as shown in Table 2. |Type of Therapy||Used in Past 12 Months (%)||Saw a provider | (% of those exercise and prayer)||34||36| \"In the case of prayer, we thought [additional] questions would be inappropriate. As for exercise, we thought the term was too vague and the practice sufficiently ubiquitous to preclude the gathering of useful data.\" [from \"The Interview\" section of Eisenberg et al, 1993] The survey did not include some common aberrant methods, and included ones that did not fit the report's own definition. Among those not mentioned were chelation therapy (for atherosclerosis), antineoplastons, iridology, reflexology, aromatherapy, crystal therapy, kinesiology, magnets, acids and other non-herb \"nutritional supplements\" consisting of biochemical precursors, co-factors, and intermediates, Maharishi Medicine (previously known as Ayurveda), naturopathy, urine-drinking, bee pollen, royal jelly, snake venom, colloidal silver, colonics, light therapy, and ozone therapy. All of these methods and others continue to receive credulous media attention, are widely promoted, and have attracted outspoken and devoted advocates. Their absence from the list raises questions of completeness and of representation of the \"alternative\" field. Perhaps their use fell below the level of detection, but if so, that makes the \"34%\" use of \"alternative methods\" to be made up of other methods, perhaps not at all unconventional. Turning to the listed items, hypnosis, while only 1%, was included in \"unconventional medicine.\" Yet hypnosis is an accepted adjunct to medical science in appropriate circumstances. It is taught at many U.S. medical schools and psychiatry residencies. Biofeedback, despite lack of firm effectiveness, retains a similar position. Although chiropractic was listed as the second most commonly used method, the study did not distinguish it from manipulative therapy, used by some osteopathic physicians and physical therapists. Some respondents may have experienced \"chiropractic \" in those forms. The study did not look at these important distinctions in order to distinguish, say, hypnosis used for pain control from use in past-life regression or to recall alien abduction experiences, or medical manipulation for joint mobilization from chiropractic treatment of childhood ear infections and learning disabilities. The following statement explained about the methods reported in the survey: \"We did not ask whether the respondents' providers of unconventional therapy were medical doctors.\" So, conceivably, some \"chiropractic\" was administered by physical therapists and D.O.'s. Some, or possibly all \"biofeedback\" took place at medical clinics specializing in pain management. And \"megavitamin therapy\" might include niacin for hypercholesterolemia and other standard pharmacologic applications of vitamins. In the case of chiropractic there is another curious anomaly. Fully 30% of those who said they used chiropractic in the previous 12 months apparently did so without benefit of a chiropractor. The authors acknowledge that \"Some forms of unconventional therapy typically involve a provider (for example, a chiropractor or acupuncturist).\" But there is no attempt to explain or account either for the 30% of chiropractic use that people were practicing on themselves or the more curious finding that 9% of users of acupuncture had apparently been practicing on themselves. Or do these inconsistencies suggest another form of massage? Again, \"Some users of unconventional therapy may visit a provider less often than once a year but may continue to use the prescribed unconventional therapy.\" Was this the case only with imagery, \"spiritual healing,\" and commercial weight loss programs, or also with a third of those who said they had used chiropractic and nearly a tenth of those who said they had used acupuncture? The most-used \"unconventional medicine\" was \"relaxation techniques.\" It was among the most-used methods for all of the ten top medical conditions considered besides \"back problems\" and allergies, as shown in Table 3. |Of Those with||\"Unconventional Medicine\" use in the just what are \"relaxation techniques?\" Medical school graduates, as well as professionals in hospitals would agree that the idea of physical, mental, and emotional rest are components of good medical care. What is \"massage?\" It is a universal practice, when people injure themselves reflexively resort to \"massage\" the area. It would be difficult, given this, to find anyone who does not utilize \"unconventional medicine.\" The authors recognized this problem, saying: \"Some of the unconventional therapies studied warrant further clarification. For example, 'massage therapy' or 'relaxation therapy' may mean different things to different people.\" But, again, this was stated only in the small print, not to be found in interpretation and discussion of results. \"Spiritual healing\" certainly means different things to different people as well. To most it means a healing ceremony of some sort, usually with a group. But is it also \"spiritual healing\" when a Catholic priest comes to the hospital bed to administer a sacrament? Or when anyone says a religious prayer? These practices are not taught in medical schools, but it seems doubtful that this deserves to be considered as \"unconventional medicine.\" Likewise, the use of \"imagery,\" especially in the management of insomnia and anxiety, is so customary that it is a clich\u00e9 to speak of counting sheep to bring on drowsiness or imagining one's audience to be naked in order to allay stage fright. But most, if not all of these qualifications, and omissions of distinctions had the cumulative effect of maximizing the numbers of survey respondents who could be said to have used \"unconventional medicine.\" This, in turn, was used to support similarly magnified extrapolations of the use and economic impact of \"unconventional medicine.\" So, for example, the Eisenberg report stated: The estimated number of ambulatory visits to providers of unconventional therapy in 1990 was 425 million. This number exceeds the estimated 388 million visits in 1990 to all primary care physicians (general and family practitioners, pediatricians, and specialists in internal medicine) combined. But these \"providers\" included masseurs and masseuses who make no claims of curing any diseases, commercial weight loss methods, and self-help group meetings. And they might have included many physicians or people who working in conjunction with physicians, delivering appropriate care in conformity with medical scientific standards. Or perhaps they were not included. It is not possible to know from the data presented. The article compares \"alternative\" visits to those to general and family practitioners, pediatricians, and internists. As before, there is no mention of obstetrics and gynecology, even though it is well-known that many women depend on their Ob/Gyn physicians as their primary doctors, or to other medical specialists who might serve as primary physicians. Considering the prevalence of \"back problems,\" allergies, and anxiety and depression, why not include the annual number of visits to orthopedists, physiatrists, physical therapists, allergists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical social workers? By including some practitioners and excluding others, the authors are able to pick their way to justifying their major conclusion that, \"unconventional medicine has an enormous presence in the U.S. health care system.\" The authors go on with their finding that \"fewer than 3 in 10 users of unconventional therapy mention its use to their medical doctors,\" ignoring the fact that some of this \"unconventional medicine\" may even have been supplied by or at the recommendation of medical doctors. Moreover, the importance of visits to \"unconventionals\" is variable. A physician may not attach much importance to whether a patient had a massage, attended a Weight Watchers' meeting, or even seen a chiropractor in the previous 12 months. No one study is expected to answer all questions about an investigated matter. But what would be useful to know is how many people, given a serious diagnosis by a physician, seek out acupuncture, homeopathy, or a brown rice diet in lieu of appropriate medical or surgical treatment, or use substances that interfere with prescribed drugs? How many unnecessarily use ineffective methods for disorders that are self-limited? \"Roughly half of those who use unconventional medicine for their principal medical conditions have no supervision of this treatment by either a medical doctor or a provider of unconventional therapy.\" But, again, what is the significance of someone's using \"relaxation techniques\" or imagery in an unsupervised setting? \"The use of unconventional therapy,\" they warned, \"especially if it is totally unsupervised, may be harmful.\" But what is this harm? Are the 30% of people who use chiropractic on their own more liable to injure themselves than are chiropractors to injure the other 70% of those who use this form of \"unconventional medicine?\" Would it be safer for people having a massage, or attending a self-help group? What may truly be harmful where these methods are concerned, is their substitution for proved measures in the setting of serious or potentially serious medical conditions. Two references were given by the authors in support of the idea that their data show a risk to the public of unsupervised \"unconventional medicine.\" One was the 1984 report of the U.S. Congress' Subcommittee on Long-Term Health and Aging, Quackery: a $10 Billion Scandal, known as the Pepper Report for the late chair of that committee, Claude Pepper. The other is the 1987 report of the Department of Health and Human Services' Health, Information and the use of Questionable Treatment: A Study of the American Public. The adverse effects noted in these sources are primarily from methods \u2014 herbs \u2014 that this article's data indicate were used by only a small minority of their respondents. They also found evidence of harm caused by delay or forgoing of appropriate medical treatment because of the substitution of unproved and ineffective therapies that are deceptively promoted. The present study did not mention those problems. The present report suggested that \"medical doctors should begin to ask patients about their use of unconventional therapy whenever they take a history.\" Yet delay seeking medical care may arise from \"spiritual healing\" and \"prayer\" as from other \"unconventional medicine.\" Yet the authors declined to ask patients details about about these two methods because it \"would be inappropriate.\" The major problem of the original survey was its exaggeration of the prevalence of questionable, unproven, disproven, and irrational health and nutrition use. The conclusions put forward in this article have been reported repeated since its publication. This has especially taken the form of a subtle term-switching device in which the curious and rather idiosyncratic \"unconventional medicine\" was converted to the authors' definition of \"alternative medicine\". The authors have not hesitated to use such language distortion. Dr. Eisenberg has argued strenuously that his data show the need for physicians to cooperate with their patients' use of whatever \"alternative medicine\" that they may find appealing. On September 9, 1997, for example, the University of Texas-Southwestern and the Alternative Medicine Research Foundation of Texas sponsored a CME conference in Dallas. Dr. Eisenberg was the keynote speaker, and he used his time to review his 1990 data. He admitted that much of the \"unconventional medicine\" considered in the survey was essentially \"extended self-care.\" He then, without further explanation, began referring to \"alternative medicine\" and focused on herbs, acupuncture, and homeopathy. There was no discussion of \"relaxation techniques,\" which accounted for the largest use of \"unconventional medicine\" in his 1993 article. There was no consideration of chiropractic, massage, imagery, or \"spiritual healing\" or of commercial weight-loss programs. Dr. Eisenberg, at this same conference in 1997, ridiculed critics of homeopathy as having taken the position that, \"it can't work, so it doesn't work?\" This paper was presented at the \"Science Meets Alternative Medicine\" conference sponsored by the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine in Philadelphia on February 27th of 1999. At that time, one commentator suggested that Dr. Eisenberg could hardly help how others might misinterpret his work. But in September of 1998 Dr. Eisenberg was a co-author of another article that appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA 280:784-787]. The second sentence of that report stated: We have known for several years that approximately 1 in 3 adults in the United States uses chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathy, or one of many other treatment modalities. The reference for this fact being \"known,\" of course, was the 1993 NEJM article. Fortunately, this deception did not appear in Dr. Eisenberg's follow up survey, a report of which appeared last November in JAMA. But in this updated report building on the 1990 data, there was no pretense about \"unconventional medicine.\" Non-rational methods were referred to as \"alternative medicine\" throughout. There was also, this time, an acknowledgement that there are \"more alternative\" and \"less alternative\" therapies among those considered in both the 1990 data and in the follow-up survey of 2055 respondents in 1997. But there was no attempt to sort out which therapies were \"more alternative\" or \"less alternative.\" There was no consideration given to what distinguishes \"more alternative\" from \"less alternative\" therapies. There was no attempt to identify whether a particular application of a therapy was consistent with facts and reason or not. The principal data presented in the follow-up survey are shown in Table 4. |Type of Therapy||Used in past 12 more therapy (excluding | exercise and prayer) |33.8||42.1 | * P .05; P .01; P .001 Many of the same problems of the 1993 article apply to this updated survey. For example, relaxation therapy and massage have still not been clarified, although this was said to be warranted five years previously in the 1993 paper. On the whole, the 1998 article is slightly less polemical that that of 1993. Given the promotional success of the earlier report, perhaps there was no need to be more emphatic. In 1998 it is merely stated that, \"the prevalence and expenditures associated with alternative medical therapies in the United States have increased substantially,\" and that, \"the magnitude of the demand for alternative therapy is noteworthy.\" Eisenberg and his co-authors do not speculate on why this is so, but express a sort of uncomprehending interest in their findings, \"in light of the relatively low rates of insurance coverage for these services.\" They do speculate that increased insurance coverage of \"alternative medicine\" would almost surely further increase its use. But they do not address the question of whether the increased use of \"alternative medicine\" since the 1990 survey has had any health benefits. On the contrary, they draw proper attention to the hazards of adverse effects, particularly in the elderly and infirm. But their data are of no help in assessing this very serious risk and no suggestions for addressing it are offered. Elsewhere, Dr. Eisenberg has suggested that physicians \"supervise\" their patients' use of \"alternative medicine\" and even co-manage their care with \"alternative medicine\" practitioners. But even in the updated 1998 survey report, Eisenberg and his collaborators do not suggest that physicians make an attempt to educate their patients or try to discourage or curtail their use of unproven and ineffective methods. Most concerning is absence of comment on major driving force behind alternative medicine - relaxed regulatory environment of the marketplace. The 1998 report mistakenly assumes \"alternative\" medicine use reflects demand for it and/or dissatisfaction with biomedical care. Two years after the collection of the Eisenberg's original survey data, Congress appropriated funds for what was to become the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM). The impetus was the will of one senator, Harkin of Iowa who used his committee chairmanship to appropriate funds because of his personal belief in bee pollen and other ineffective remedies. OAM has now been upgraded with increased funding to the Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. A year after the 1993 NEJM report, the [Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)](https://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html) freed the health food industry from much of the regulatory oversight of the FDA. An avalanche of uncritical media coverage of unproved claims and practices followed. A swell of advertising dollars poured into the print and electronic media. This was a potent, and not coincidental combination. Ideologically motivated private foundations such as the $300 million Fetzer Foundation had poured millions of dollars into medical school courses and research, had sponsored the Bill Moyers' PBS series \"Healing and the Mind,\" sponsored the Eisenberg study plus his Harvard Medical School course and annual post-graduate courses for physicians and other health professionals. These and the first Eisenberg paper itself acted to create a perception that \"alternative medicine\" is safe, effective, and at least as good, if not better than, scientific biomedicine. The authors did not comment on the fact that use of acupuncturists, homeopaths, and chiropractors remained stable over the ten years, while the \"alternative medicine\" that drew the greatest increase in use, more than tripling between 1990 and 1997 were over-the-counter herbal medicine, folk remedies, and homeopathic products, all of which have been aggressively mass-marketed in the wake of DSHEA. Major manufacturers are rolling out herbal and homeopathic versions of their established trade-named products. Vitamin sales lagged by comparison, having been previously marketed maximally for years. On the other hand, many \"nutritional supplements\" combine herbs, vitamins, as well as additional ingredients and may claim to be homeopathic as well. Thus, someone's purchasing a single over-the-counter \"nutritional supplement\" of this kind would contribute to an increased prevalence of use of several different forms of \"alternative medicine.\" In 1996, under pressure from organized acupuncturists, the FDA reclassified acupuncture needles as Class II \"medical devices,\" which permitted their use and associated claims of various health benefits. In 1997 the OAM, in association with its former interim Director, carefully orchestrated a seemingly biased panel that issued a consensus statement in favor of acupuncture. The 1998 Eisenberg article mentioned none of these things, while marveling at the public's alleged demand for \"alternative medicine.\" The impression remains that acupuncture and \"natural\" products are safe, effective, and even constitute \"cutting edge\" medical science. Eisenberg is silent on how these factors may have affected his updated survey information of 1997. Yet they are crucial to any evaluation. Manufacturers are now selling products which are, for all intents and purposes, medications. But, legally, as \"nutritional supplements,\" they are \"foods.\" Even food products are now appearing which contain herbal ingredients, such as soup containing Saint John's Wort and corn chips laced with kava. Any serious discussion of the prevalence, let alone the medical and public health implications of \"alternative medicine\" will be non-productive until and unless their terminology is clarified. For if \"unconventional\" medicine cannot be distinguished from \"alternative medicine,\" \"complementary medicine,\" \"integrative medicine,\" and quackery, then there will be nothing left to call quackery or illegal promotion. Likewise, if medicine cannot be distinguished from exercise, prayer, relaxation, self-help practices, and other \"extended self-care,\" then there will be nothing left that will not be medicine. These issues are important not only scientifically, but also in the social, cultural, and economic context of continued medical scientific progress amid rising medical care costs. Unfortunately, Dr. Eisenberg, his collaborators, the lay and medical press and other commentators have been obscuring rather than clarifying, hindering instead of helping, honest efforts to confront them. ________________________ Dr. Gorski practices obstetrics and gynecology in Arlington, Texas, and is president of the Greater Dallas-Fort Worth Council Against Health Fraud.

At the time it was published, he was editor-in-chief emeritus of The New England Journal of Medicine and professor emeritus of medicine and social medicine at Harvard Medical School. I Andrew Weil, M.D., is variously described on the covers of his best-selling books as \"the guru of alternative medicine,\" \"one of the most skilled, articulate, and important leaders in the field of health and healing,\" \"a pioneer in the medicine of the future,\" and \"an extraordinary phenomenon.\" On his website, which records over two and a half million hits a month, he is called \"America's most trusted medical expert.\" A recent cover of Time, which featured the familiar picture of his bald head and bewhiskered cherubic countenance, announced that \"medicine man Dr. Andrew Weil has made New Age remedies popular.\" In the accompanying story, Time tells us that \"millions of Americans swear by\" his medical advice. Not all of this is hype. Weil is arguably the best known and most influential of the many physician-writers now in the vanguard of the alternative medicine movement. He is also one of the most prolific. Since 1972 he has written eight books. The first three were mostly about the effects of natural drugs on consciousness, but the remaining five, all published in the past fifteen years, are about health and healing. Read together with one remarkable chapter in his first book, these more recent works provide a comprehensive description of alternative medicine, as seen through the eyes of its most serious and systematic advocate. If Deepak Chopra is the mystical poet-laureate of the movement, then Weil is its heavy-duty theoretician and apologist. He directs a large and astonishingly successful medical marketing enterprise that might be called Dr. Andrew Weil, Inc. No longer the angry young rebel, he has become the urbane and supremely self-assured CEO of alternative medicine, who is seeking to reshape the medical establishment that he once scorned. The popularity of his teachings, and the spreading wave of interest in alternative remedies that he and others have inspired, are forcing mainstream medicine to deal with a counterculture that it would have preferred to ignore. \"Alternative medicine\" is the term generally used to designate a varied collection of methods for the prevention, the diagnosis, or the treatment of disease that are not generally accepted by regular (or \"allopathic\") physicians and have not been part of the standard medical school curriculum in the United States. Some of these methods are very old. Acupuncture and other kinds of traditional Chinese medicine, as well as the Ayurvedic medicine of ancient Hinduism, were practiced before the Christian era, and they still flourish. Native American shamans and medicine men used herbal and ritual healing before the European conquest of America, and such practices still exist. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many healing cults were contending with allopathic physicians for popular support. These included homeopathy, naturopathy, and herbal medicine, psychic and faith healing, magnetic therapy and chiropractic and osteopathy. More recent twentieth-century additions to the alternative medicine family include therapeutic touch, guided imagery, biofeedback, and various forms of diet therapy. In the past few years, two new terms have come into use: \"complementary medicine\" and \"integrative medicine.\" They identify a recent development in the alternative medicine movement championed by Weil and others: the idea that alternative medicine should be used in conjunction with, rather than instead of, mainstream allopathic methods. Until now, alternative medicine has generally been rejected by medical scientists and educators, and by most practicing physicians. The reasons are many, but the most important reason is the difference in mentality between the alternative practitioners and the medical establishment. The leaders of the establishment believe in the scientific method, and in the rule of evidence, and in the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology upon which the modern view of nature is based. Alternative practitioners either do not seem to care about science or explicitly reject its premises. Their methods are often based on notions totally at odds with science, common sense, and modern conceptions of the structure and the function of the human body. In advancing their claims, they do not appear to recognize the need for objective evidence, asserting that the intuitions and the personal beliefs of patients and healers are all that is needed to validate their methods. One might have expected such thinking to alienate most people in a technologically advanced society such as ours; but the alternative medicine movement, and the popularity of gurus such as Weil, are growing rapidly. Weil's writings are ambiguous about the conflict between science and alternative medicine, as they are about many other issues in alternative medicine. Yes, he thinks that all healing methods ought to be tested; and yes, modern science can make useful contributions to our understanding of health and disease. Yet the scientific method is not, for Weil, the only way, or even the best way, to learn about nature and the human body. Many important truths are intuitively evident and do not need scientific support, even when they seem to contradict logic. Conventional science-based medicine has its uses, but they are limited. Like so many of the other gurus of alternative medicine, Weil is not bothered by logical contradictions in his argument, or encumbered by a need to search for objective evidence. This habit of thought was evident early in Weil's career. He was educated at Harvard College and Harvard Medical School in the '60s, but he revolted against those academic bastions. Like many other students of his generation, he experimented with mind-altering drugs. He was a botany major and, not surprisingly for those days, he became interested in the psychedelic properties of certain plants. Later, in medical school, he participated in studies of the clinical and psychological effects of marijuana, which led to a few publications in scientific journals. He also developed a strong antipathy toward many of the basic concepts of conventional medicine, and the traditional pedagogical methods then employed to teach them. We learn a little about Weil's postgraduate years from the brief autobiographical comments in the preface to The Natural Mind, his first book. After a one-year internship at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco in 1968-69, he began what was supposed to have been a two-year tour of duty at the National Institute of Mental Health. He resigned after a year. He says it was because of official opposition to his work with marijuana. He then left the world of allopathic medicine entirely, to go off to an Indian reservation in South Dakota to study with a Sioux medicine man and learn about herbal medicine and ritual healing. \"On the reservation,\" he says, \"I participated in sweat lodge ceremonies, grew a beard, and `dropped out.'\" At home afterward, \"I started to practice yoga, experiment with vegetarianism, and learn to meditate.\" In 1971 he began to write The Natural Mind, which became a best-seller and launched his career as a writer. The Natural Mind (1972) is mainly a criticism of American drug policy and an exposition of Weil's views on the interaction of psychedelic drugs with the mind. It also expounds his general philosophy of mind-body relations upon which much of his later writings on health and healing is based. The seventh chapter, entitled \"A Trip to Stonesville,\" should be required reading for all who would understand the origins of Weil's belief in the healing power of the mind. It is a startling document\u2014a sharply drawn manifesto of New Age biology, a direct challenge to the scientific basis of conventional medicine, and a revealing window on Weil's style of thought. And, since a theory of mind-body relations is central to most current formulations of alternative medicine, this chapter must be considered one of the movement's most important philosophical statements. It merits a detailed examination. According to Weil, many of his basic insights about the causes of disease and the nature of healing come from what he calls \"stoned thinking,\" that is, thoughts experienced while under the influence of psychedelic agents or during other states of \"altered consciousness\" induced by trances, ritual magic, hypnosis, meditation, and the like. He cites some of the characteristics of \"stoned thinking\" that give it advantages over \"straight\" thinking; these include a greater reliance on \"intuition\" and an \"acceptance of the ambivalent nature of things,\" by which he means a tolerance for \"the coexistence of opposites that appear to be mutually antagonistic.\" In Weil's view, intellect, logic, and inductive reasoning from observed fact are the limited instruments of \"straight\" thinking, and should be subservient to guidance by the intuitive insights that are gained during states of altered consciousness and \"stoned\" thinking. Weil tells us that \"the history of science makes clear that the greatest advancements in man's understanding of the universe are made by intuitive leaps at the frontiers of knowledge, not by intellectual walks along well-traveled paths.\" He neglects to add, unfortunately, that to be successful these \"intuitive leaps\" had to explain all of the relevant observed facts. Intuition can be a valuable tool for interpreting the facts, and even for guessing what the facts will prove to be, but it cannot substitute for the facts. Yet Weil may not agree with this. He asserts that \"there exists within us a source of direct information about reality that can teach us all we need to know.\" Does he mean that this inner \"source\" need not conform to observed facts? Apparently so, because chapter seven's main thrust is to assert the primacy of intuition over observation. In Weil's mind, intuition, no matter how bizarre and unsubstantiated, rules the day. But if intuition rules, how would we find the truth when one person's intuition conflicts with another's? Weil does not appear to consider that a problem, either. For, as \"stoned thinking\" reveals, there is not one truth, but many truths. Reality itself is basically \"ambivalent.\" Weil notes that the wisdom of \"stoned thinking\" is reflected in the teachings of Oriental philosophies and religions, which have always understood the essentially \"ambivalent\" nature of reality. He further contends that, with quantum theory, modern physicists have pursued this idea about the paradoxical ambivalence of reality into the subatomic world, \"where they find that entities like electrons and photons can exist either as waves or particles, energy or matter.\" \"Ordinary consciousness\" cannot accept such riddles, he says, but modern physicists can, and so can those who learn \"stoned thinking.\" In states of \"altered consciousness\" we wipe out contradictions and resolve perplexities such as the mind-body problem. We see that \"mind and body are really the two expressions of the same phenomenon-just as waves and particles are two phases of expression of the entity called an electron.\" I will return to Weil's invocation of quantum physics in support of his arguments, because it reflects a basic misunderstanding that underlies much of the present revolt against science and science-based medicine. There is more of this kind of thing in the remainder of his \"Stonesville\" chapter, much of which defies rational belief or is just plain wrong about the facts. Weil states, for example, that \"stoned\" thinking enables us to gain control of our autonomic, or involuntary, nervous system, and that the practical application of this thinking in the form of \"autonomic feedback control\" enables patients to control high blood pressure more effectively and safely than by the use of antihypertensive drugs. He claims that allopathic physicians \"have no effective drug for high blood pressure.\" Now, even in 1972, when The Natural Mind was first published, this statement was dubious, to say the least; and it was certainly false in 1985 when the book was republished and supposedly updated. Weil tells us that patients can be taught to lower their blood pressure by a form of training called \"feedback control.\" The fact is that \"feedback control\" (or \"the relaxation response,\" as it is called by Dr. Herbert Benson, its chief advocate and another well-known guru of alternative medicine) produces at most only small and usually transient reductions in blood pressure. Feedback control has never been shown to be as effective in the long-term control of moderate to severe hypertension as any of a variety of pharmacological agents prescribed for this purpose. There are always risks of side effects with any active pharmaceutical, and antihypertensive agents are no exception. When properly used, however, they have proven beyond reasonable doubt to be a major advance in medical therapeutics. In fact, they are one big reason for the significant decline over the past three decades in the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure, all of which can result from uncontrolled, severe hypertension. Weil would have been correct if he had simply observed that anti-hypertensive drugs are often used excessively, particularly when blood pressure is only mildly elevated. He would also have been correct had he suggested that a reduction in stress and a change in diet and lifestyle will often help in the management of such cases. But in The Natural Mind he suggests that self-treatment is the treatment of choice in many if not most cases. In his more recent books about self-healing approaches to health care, he is more prudent: he advises patients to check their own blood pressure and to seek guidance from an allopathic physician if simple remedies are not working. Unfortunately, the antiallopathic thrust in his teaching is more apt to be heeded than his cautions and his qualifications. Seriously hypertensive patients who delay seeking proper medical treatment may, as a result, suffer great harm. The neglect of available and often effective standard medical treatment for many kinds of illness would seem to be an inevitable consequence of the dogma promulgated in the seventh chapter of The Natural Mind. Here are other examples of Weil's casual dismissal of common sense and medical fact in this chapter, and of his penchant for sweeping generalizations that cannot stand analysis. \"My intuitions about disease are: first, that its physical manifestations are mostly caused by nonmaterial factors, in particular by unnatural restraints placed on the unconscious mind; and second, that the limits to what human consciousness can cause in the physical body are far beyond where most of us imagine them.\" Or, again: \"Since leaving the world of allopathic practice, I have witnessed a number of impressive nonallopathic cures of ... dramatic illnesses, including cancer and life-threatening infections.\" And later: \"To the straight mind nonallopathic healing sounds very mystical. Faith healing is held in contempt by most rational people, despite the abundant evidence of cures.\" (The italics are mine.) Weil's later books make many claims for such \"cures,\" as we shall see, but despite his reference to \"abundant evidence,\" he almost never gives us anything more than the claim itself\u2014unsupported by objective and documented observations. To Weil, subjective belief, if persuasive enough to the patient, should be adequate to support the claim of reality. And by \"reality\" he does not refer simply to the patient's state of mind, but to the physical dimensions of the disease itself. The allegedly miraculous \"cures\" are not simply dramatic improvements in symptoms, but the disappearance of all physical evidence of disease. And why shouldn't this be reasonable if one believes, like Weil, that consciousness is the primary reality and that the physical aspects of disease, indeed the entire material world itself, are simply another aspect of mind? The extent to which Weil reveres consciousness regardless of its thought content is revealed in the final sections of his \"Stonesville\" chapter. Here he favors us with his views on psychosis, on the Jungian theory of shared universal consciousness, and on the reality of mental telepathy, extrasensory perception, and hallucinatory experiences. On psychosis: \"Psychotics are persons whose nonordinary experience is exceptionally strong ... every psychotic is a potential sage or healer.\" With regard to the National Institute of Mental Health's research efforts to find the physical basis of psychosis: \"If it sticks to its present course, NIMH will be the last institution in America to recognize the positive potential of psychosis\u2014a potential so overwhelming that I am almost tempted to call psychotics the evolutionary vanguard of our species. They possess the secret of changing reality by changing the mind; if they can learn to use that talent for positive ends, there are no limits to what they can accomplish.\" With respect to C.G. Jung's ideas, Weil says: \"It appears that at some level of the unconscious we pass beyond personal awareness into a universal awareness unlimited by time and space. Most of us may think we never experience such a thing, but it may be that we simply never pay attention to it. I am convinced it happens.\" He then cites examples of such experiences caused by the ingestion of hallucinogenic herbs in Indian sacramental rituals. About shared consciousness and mental telepathy, he has this to say: \"Not only do I think each of us can share consciousness, I think all of us are already doing it all the time.... Extrasensory perceptions are not unusual talents possessed by specially gifted individuals. They are normal unconscious events, and scientists who attempt to document them by laboratory experiments will never get to experience them directly.\" One might think that this kind of talk, written more than 25 years ago by a youthful and angry rebel against medical scientific orthodoxy, would be an embarrassment to the 56-year-old leader of a movement that aspires to integrate alternative concepts into the curriculum and the practice of conventional medicine. Not so. In a brief preface to the edition of The Natural Mind that appeared this year, Weil explicitly reaffirms his early views: \"The philosophy of my first book is the same philosophy that underlies my writing about health.\" To be even more specific, he adds: \"The seed of my thinking about conventional and alternative medicine can be found in Chapter 7 of this book.\" So we must take him at his word: he really does believe in miracles and in faith healing, in the ability of mind to cause and to cure disease, and in the existence of a consciousness that is in some real sense independent of the brain. In fact, these ideas reverberate in all of his later writing. The seventh chapter of The Natural Mind is simply the first and most forceful statement of a philosophy that has softened and blurred a bit, as Weil's career has progressed, but is fundamentally unchanged. And this philosophy poses serious intellectual problems for Weil's current attempt to integrate alternative and conventional medical practices. II. The Natural Mind was followed by two more popular books about consciousness and mind-altering drugs\u2014The Marriage of the Sun and Moon: A Quest for Unity in Consciousness (1980); and, with Winifred Rosen, From Chocolate to Morphine: Everything You Need to Know About Mind-Altering Drugs (1983). Neither book dealt directly with alternative medicine. His next book on medicine was Health and Healing (1983, republished in 1998). By then Weil had established himself in Tucson as a general medical practitioner and was on the part-time clinical faculty of the College of Medicine of the University of Arizona, where he gave an elective course of lectures about alternative medicine. Health and Healing was the first of a series of five books he was to write in the years from 1983 to 1998 and, like most of them, it was a national best-seller. It established Weil as a leading figure in the alternative medicine movement. More than any of his writings before or after, it provided a broad and fairly systematic exposition of his opinions on the nature of health and healing, on allopathic medicine, and on the varieties of alternative or unconventional medicine. In the preface to the 1998 edition of Health and Healing, Weil remarks that \"it remains the philosophical and theoretical basis of all my subsequent work in medicine.\" Consider Weil's strange discussion in this book of sickness and health. \"Sickness is the manifestation of evil in the body,\" he proclaims, \"just as health is the manifestation of holiness. Sickness and health are not simply physical states.... They are rooted in the deepest and most mysterious strata of Being.\" He introduces these ideas in the context of his views on the connection between religion, magic, and medicine. \"In our society,\" he observes, \"the commonality of religion, magic, and medicine is obscured. Our medical doctors have narrowed their view to pay attention only to the physical body and the material aspects of illness. As a result ... they do not see or integrate the nonphysical forces that animate and direct the physical body,\" and they do not realize that \"health and illness are particular manifestations of good and evil, requiring all the help of religion and philosophy to understand and all the techniques of magic to manipulate. Science and intellect can show us mechanisms and details of physical reality\u2014and that knowledge is surely of value\u2014but they cannot unveil the deep mysteries. You cannot restore health in yourself or in others until you know in your heart what health is.\" Lest we despair of ever knowing in our heart what health is, Weil unveils the mystery: \"Health is wholeness\u2014wholeness in its most profound sense, with nothing left out and everything in just the right order to manifest the mystery of balance. Far from being simply the absence of disease, health is a dynamic and harmonious equilibrium of all the elements and forces making up and surrounding a human being.\" Health, it seems, is a mystery explained by another mysterious principle. This is the \"mystery of balance.\" Weil follows this revelation with an additional \"ten principles of health and illness,\" the most mysterious of which is the last: \"Proper breathing is a key to good health.\" He explains that breathing, since it can be voluntary or involuntary, is a \"bridge between the conscious and unconscious minds as well as between mind and body. Proper breathing nourishes the central nervous system, establishes a harmonious pattern for other bodily rhythms, and also regulates moods and emotions.... Improper breathing is a common cause of ill health. By decreasing general vitality, it increases susceptibility to agents of disease. It can also directly cause problems in many different systems of the body. Learning how to breathe and working consciously with breath is a simple, safe, effective, and inexpensive way to promote good health of mind and body.\" \"Breathing\" is an important and recurring theme in Weil's prescriptions for health and healing, and it holds a prominent place in Eight Weeks to Optimum Health, which appeared in 1997. As far as I can see, his opinions on this subject are largely nonsense. There is not the slightest medical evidence that \"improper breathing is a common cause of ill health.\" All the clinical and physiological evidence points to exactly the reverse relationship. It suggests that many types of disease and physiological dysfunction can affect breathing. Sometimes this secondary change in breathing can be serious enough to change the normal intake of oxygen or the normal elimination of carbon dioxide in ways that further impair health; but the primary causes of the problem are the diseases or the physiological disturbances that cause the abnormal pattern of breathing, not the breathing itself. While it is true that conscious attention to breathing can help individuals to relax, there is no evidence that the breathing exercises Weil advocates have any special advantage over any other techniques for relaxation, or that they have any special therapeutic powers. Like so many of his other pronouncements, Weil's claims about breathing come ex cathedra from his own self-asserted authority as guru and healer. Much of what he has to say about health and healing in this book and in his later works is just like this fanciful section on breathing\u2014a bald assertion without any credible rationale or supporting objective evidence. Then there is Weil's typically ambiguous assessment of conventional, or allopathic, medicine. First he concedes that it is not all bad, and that \"regular medicine is the most effective system I know for dealing with many common and serious problems,\" among them acute medical and surgical emergencies. But then he adds that \"regular medicine is on very shaky ground\" in dealing with other common problems. \"I would look elsewhere than conventional medicine for help if I contracted a severe viral disease like hepatitis or polio, or a metabolic disease like diabetes. I would not seek allopathic treatment for cancer, except for a few varieties, or for such chronic ailments as arthritis, asthma, hypertension (high blood pressure), multiple sclerosis, or for many other chronic diseases....\" This is a startling list of major diseases to be ruled off-limits for conventional medicine. One wonders which of the remaining chronic diseases Weil is willing to concede to the allopaths, and how he knows where to draw the line. Some of Weil's criticisms of medical practitioners in this and other books are nonetheless valid. I agree with him that conventional physicians are often too interested in the disease and not enough interested in the patient; too inclined to use expensive technology and potent pharmaceuticals when simpler and more conservative approaches would work at least as well. And he is correct in noting that mainstream medicine, despite its many successes, still has only a limited ability to change the course of many serious chronic illnesses. Yet that hardly justifies Weil's sweeping and irresponsible dismissal of allopathic medicine's role in the diagnosis, the management, and the palliation of all the serious illnesses that he enumerates and the indeterminate list to which he alludes. He implies that alternative medicine could do better, but there is no published evidence to support that opinion. And even if Weil's assertions about the superiority of alternative methods for the treatment of some diseases were correct, how could patients be expected to know when to seek help from alternative healers unless they knew in advance what was wrong with them? One of the main reasons to consult a physician is to determine whether symptoms need to be taken seriously and what might be causing them. Weil's advice could result in dangerous delays in the diagnosis and the treatment of serious illness, unless he were also to recommend that patients first seek competent medical evaluation and advice before considering unconventional treatments. That may be what he had in mind in recently establishing an \"integrative medicine\" clinic at the University of Arizona, in which allopathic physicians prescribe both conventional and unconventional treatments. Still, without credible evidence that unconventional treatments are equivalent to, or better than, standard medical care, even that eclectic approach is seriously flawed. III. One of Weil's central themes in Health and Healing, and in his subsequent work, is his criticism of mainstream medicine's reliance on pharmaceuticals instead of herbal medicines. The latter are presently enjoying a great resurgence in popularity, due largely to the endorsement of prominent advocates such as Weil, and to the promotional activities of a \"natural products\" industry that received a big boost in 1994, when Congress gave the industry permission to market herbal preparations with less rigorous oversight by the FDA than the agency exercises over drugs. Manufacturers of herbal preparations can avoid many of the customary rigors of FDA drug regulation simply by labeling these products \"dietary supplements.\" In 1997, the herbal medicine market had sales of nearly $4 billion, and a stroll down the aisles of almost any supermarket or chain drugstore will confirm that business is booming. A cover story in Time magazine a few weeks ago was all about this burgeoning new herbal remedy business and the popular craze for \"natural\" medicines. Weil's preference for herbs and his dislike of synthetic pharmaceutical products probably stem from his earlier training in botany and his long interest in the psychedelic properties of plants. It also reflects his belief in the virtues of \"natural\" healing methods that patients themselves can employ without recourse to physicians or expensive medical technology. Herbs can be purchased without prescription and are relatively inexpensive in comparison with prescription drugs. In earlier times herbs were the only medicinal remedies available, and botany was a part of the medical school curriculum. But then scientists learned how to extract and synthesize the active constituents of medicinal herbs, and medical botany was replaced by modern pharmacology. Modern pharmacological science now provides physicians with a vast armamentarium of clinically effective synthetic compounds, many derived from or closely related to substances found in nature, others created in the laboratory. These pure compounds can be standardized and tested for purity, clinical potency, and safety far more easily than the complex and highly variable natural plant materials doctors formerly prescribed. In some advanced Western countries-in Germany, for example\u2014herbal medicines are still widely prescribed, but the manufacture, the purity, and the potency of these preparations are far more carefully regulated by the government than in the United States. Weil doesn't like the modern pharmaceutical industry and he wants us to return to our former dependence on herbs. His arguments are on balance unconvincing, but they are not without some reason. Weil has an arguable case, I think, when he criticizes the pharmaceutical industry for promoting expensive new drugs that have little or no advantage over older and less expensive drugs, and for sometimes being insufficiently attentive to their risks. I also have some sympathy with his criticism of the excessive prescribing of potent pharmaceuticals by physicians, and the common practice of prescribing many drugs simultaneously without sufficient attention to their toxic or interactive effects. There is no doubt that improper use of pharmaceuticals, including mistakes in dosage and even inadvertent administration of the wrong drug, causes many serious mishaps in hospital and office practice. Even the proper use of drugs can sometimes cause fatal reactions. Misuse of antibiotics can cause the development of drug-resistant strains of bacteria. Still, the fact remains that pharmaceuticals are an essential part of medical practice. Without them there would be no effective treatment or palliation of many serious diseases. On balance, the good done by modern pharmaceuticals far outweighs the harm, though zealous advocates of \"natural\" remedies (Weil among them) insist otherwise. Even in Germany, where botanical medicines are widely used by allopathic physicians, pharmaceutical drugs are the mainstay of treatment for serious illnesses. Weil claims that the presence of many different active and inactive ingredients, known and unknown, makes natural botanical products safer and more effective than synthetic pharmaceuticals. This is mostly speculation, since there have been very few clinical trials directly comparing herbs with pharmaceuticals in the treatment of specific ailments. What Weil does not mention, here or elsewhere in his books, are the problems created by the lack of purity and standardization of herbal products. A recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine contained several reports of serious clinical complications resulting from adulterants or contaminants in commercial preparations of herbs. As an accompanying editorial in the Journal noted, there can be no safe and rational use of herbal medicines without regulation of their purity and their potency\u2014even assuming that there were evidence of potentially useful clinical effects. Weil has a good word to say for almost all alternative healing methods, except for some practices used by so-called \"holistic\" physicians. \"Holistic medicine\" is an outdated term that formerly referred to many of the same methods in common use by today's alternative healers, but also included other less widely used methods of diagnosis and treatment that have not attracted much attention recently. Why Weil singles the latter out for disapproval is not entirely clear, since his criticisms would seem to apply equally to many of the alternative methods that he does endorse. In any case, after a general review of the latter, he concludes that the belief of the healer and the patient in the effectiveness of the various forms of alternative treatment is the common explanation that ties them all together. This is his conclusion: \"Since belief alone can elicit healing, the occasional success of treatments based on absurd theories is not mysterious.\" Weil next considers the healing power of the placebo effect, by which he means the faith of the patient and the practitioner in the therapeutic value of whatever treatment is being used. He says that all treatments depend more or less on this faith, and that is why any treatment, real or imaginary, may be able to cure any disease in certain patients by helping them to mobilize their innate healing powers. Sometimes the result is mainly due to the direct physical action of the treatment, and sometimes it is mainly due to the patient's own belief in the treatment, and sometimes it appears to be a combination of effects. Weil probably believes that herbal remedies, diet, physical exercise, and other lifestyle changes belong mainly in the first category. Faith healing, therapeutic touch, magnetism, and most of the other more esoteric alternative healing methods would probably be placed in the second category. Meditation, breathing exercises, biofeedback, acupuncture, musculoskeletal manipulations, and yoga would probably be placed in the third category. How does Weil know that any of these alternative methods, or any combination of them, regardless of the way they work, can cure disease? Because he has been told about, or thinks that he has seen, apparent cures of supposedly incurable diseases that could not be otherwise explained. And where is the documented, objective evidence of such cures? There isn't any. We simply must trust Weil's opinion, and the belief of those who report these events to him. Weil's books are full of such stories, none supported by anything resembling scientific evidence. Here are some examples. In Eight Weeks to Optimum Health, Weil tells about a letter he received from a patient who wrote: \"Six years ago (I'm now twenty-seven) the doctors threw the ugly `C-word' at me and made it sound like a death sentence. (It was bone cancer.) They decided that they were the authorities and I was the victim and the only way was their way. I walked out of their offices never to return. I took up biking (about five hundred miles a week) and running (about sixty miles a week), and ate fresh fruit, juices, and whole grains ... nothing else. Too bad more people out there won't acknowledge what a little self-determination and using one's subconscious can do to return a person to wholeness.\" The patient goes on to say that he or she is now entirely well and hopes to \"work toward developing programs for others to offer them alternative pathways toward health and wholeness.\" How do we know that this person really had \"bone cancer\" and what really happened? We don't know, of course, but that doesn't seem to concern Weil, who cites the case without further comment as evidence of self-induced healing of a serious disease. In the same book, Weil tells about a woman patient who had \"an unusual form of Parkinson's disease\" which caused her to have frequent seizures during sleep. Presumably in response to Weil's advice, she tried \"acupuncture, yoga, massage, meditation and other stress-reduction work,\" and finally \"respiratory biofeedback,\" which eventually caused the seizures to stop. Here again, there is no medical documentation of the diagnosis or the alleged effects of the alternative treatments. A final example comes from Spontaneous Healing (1995). It concerns a man with scleroderma (a usually progressive and fatal disease of the skin and internal organs, thought to be an autoimmune disorder) who cured himself with vinegar, lemons, aloe vera juice and vitamin E. How does Weil know this really happened? Apparently, the patient told him so. It was only a testimonial but, as Weil explains in Spontaneous Healing, he finds these stories meaningful. \"I collect this material, save it, and take it seriously. In its totality and range and abundance it makes one powerful point: People can get better ... from all sorts of conditions or diseases, even very severe ones of long duration.\" That people usually \"get better,\" that most relatively minor diseases heal spontaneously or seem to improve with simple common remedies, is hardly news. Every physician, indeed every grandmother, knows that. Yet before we accept Weil's contention that serious illnesses such as \"bone cancer,\" \"Parkinson's disease,\" or \"scleroderma\" are similarly curable, or respond to alternative healing methods, we need at least to have some convincing medical evidence that the patients whom he reports in these testimonials did indeed suffer from these diseases, and that they were really improved or healed. The perplexity is not that Weil is using \"anecdotes\" as proof, but that we don't know whether the anecdotes are true. Anecdotal evidence is often used in the conventional medical literature to suggest the effectiveness of treatment that has not yet been tested by formal clinical trials. In fact, much of the mainstream professional literature in medicine consists of case reports\u2014\"anecdotes,\" of a kind. The crucial difference between those case reports and the testimonials that abound in Weil's books (and throughout the literature of alternative medicine) is that the case reports in the mainstream literature are almost always meticulously documented with objective data to establish the diagnosis and to verify what happened, whereas the testimonials cited by alternative medicine practitioners usually are not. Weil almost never gives any objective data to support his claims. Almost everything is simply hearsay and personal opinion. To the best of my knowledge, Weil himself has published nothing in the peer-reviewed medical literature to document objectively his personal experiences with allegedly cured patients or to verify his claims for the effectiveness of any of the unorthodox remedies he uses. He is not alone in this respect. Few proponents of alternative medicine have so far published clinical reports that would stand the rigorous scientific scrutiny given to studies of traditional medical treatments published in the serious medical journals. Alternative medicine is still a field rich in undocumented claims and anecdotes and relatively lacking in credible scientific reports. IV. The growing interest of the medical establishment in studying alternative medicine may soon establish the credibility\u2014or the incredibility\u2014of alternative medical notions. In the absence of supporting evidence, however, skepticism is surely in order, particularly since belief in much of what Weil is saying about mind and body, and the ability of consciousness to operate in the physical world, requires a rejection of the fundamental physical laws upon which our current views of nature and the human body are based. This does not appear to ruffle Weil, who believes that these laws have already been changed. Indeed, he argues that physicians need to understand that modern quantum physics has overturned much of classical physical theory and is revealing a new perspective on nature, in which the observing mind is the primary reality, and can cause natural phenomena to behave oddly. It is time for us to reject the old-fashioned scientific materialism, says Weil. \"What most medical doctors do not know is that the scientific model of reality has changed radically since 1900 and no longer views the universe as an orderly mechanism independent of the consciousness observing it.\" In one of the final chapters of Health and Healing, called \"What Doctors Can Learn from Physicists,\" Weil offers his interpretation of the revelations of quantum physics. Experimental data have shown that when observed one way, light seems to be acting like a wave, and when observed another way, it acts like a stream of particles. Quantum theory embraces that paradox in a probabilistic, mathematical description of subatomic physical phenomena that seems incomprehensible to common sense and ordinary experience, but that accords with the experimental data. Weil's interpretation of quantum theory is that it forces us \"to consider consciousness [by which he presumably means the mind of the observer] as an active agent in the formation of reality, inseparable from it.\" And so he concludes that \"in the world of ordinary experience, the materialistic and mechanistic theories of the past may continue to seem right and work as reasonable approximations, but if consciousness has to be included to explain observed properties of atomic particles, it cannot be independent of systems composed of those particles, whether rocks, stars, plants, or, especially, human beings.\" According to Weil, quantum physics in effect validates his \"stoned thinking,\" because it demonstrates that ultimate reality is in the mind of the observer, and thoughts can make anything happen. Thus Weil can believe in miraculous cures even while claiming to be rational and scientific, because he thinks that quantum theory supports his views. Yet the leading physicists of our time do not accept such an interpretation of quantum theory. They do not believe quantum theory says anything about the role of human consciousness in the physical world. They see quantum laws as simply a useful mathematical formulation for describing subatomic phenomena that are not adequately handled by classical physical theory, although the latter remains quite satisfactory for the analysis of physical events at the macro-level. Steven Weinberg has observed that \"quantum mechanics has been overwhelmingly important to physics, but I cannot find any messages for human life in quantum mechanics that are different in any important way from those of Newtonian physics.\" And overriding all discussions of the meaning of quantum physics is the fundamental fact that quantum theory, like all other scientific law, is only valid to the extent that it predicts and accords with the evidence provided by observation and objective measurement. Richard Feynman said it quite simply: \"Observation is the ultimate and final judge of the truth of an idea.\" Feynman also pointed out that scientific observations need to be objective, reproducible, and, in a sense, public\u2014that is, available to all interested scientists who wish to check the observations for themselves. Surely almost all scientists would agree with Feynman that, regardless of what theory of nature we wish to espouse, we cannot escape the obligation to support our claims with objective evidence. All theories must conform to the facts or be discarded. So, if Weil cannot produce credible evidence to validate the miraculous cures that he claims for the healing powers of the mind, and if he does not support with objective data the claims he and others make for the effectiveness of alternative healing methods, he cannot presume to wear the mantle of science, and his appeal to quantum theory cannot help him. Some apologists for alternative medicine have argued that since their healing methods are based on a \"paradigm\" different from that of traditional medicine, traditional standards of evidence do not apply. Weil sometimes seems to agree with that view, as when he talks about \"stoned thinking\" and the \"ambivalent\" nature of reality, but more recently\u2014as he seeks to integrate alternative with allopathic medicine\u2014he seems to acknowledge the need for objective evidence. This, at least, is how I would interpret one of his most recent and ambitious publishing ventures, the editorship of the new quarterly journal Integrative Medicine. Integrative Medicine describes itself as a \"peer-reviewed journal ... committed to gathering evidence for the safety and efficacy of all approaches to health according to the highest standards of scientific research, while remaining open to new paradigms and honoring the healing power of nature.\" The Associate Editors and Editorial Board include prominent names in both alternative medicine and allopathic medicine, who presumably support that mission. Yet the first two issues will disappoint those who were looking for original clinical research based on new, objective data. Perhaps subsequent issues will be different, but in any case it is hard to understand the need for Weil's new journal if he truly intends to hold manuscripts to accepted scientific standards: there already exist many leading peer-reviewed medical journals that will review research studies of alternative healing methods on their merits. During the past decade or so, only a few such studies have passed rigorous review and have been published in first-rate journals. Recently, more studies have been published, but very few of them report significant clinical effects. And that is pretty much where matters now stand. Despite much avowed interest in research on alternative medicine and increased investment in support of such research, the evidentiary underpinnings of unconventional healing methods are still largely lacking. V. Health and Healing, published in 1983, was the last of Weil's comprehensive and broadly conceived commentaries on health and disease. Beginning in 1995, with Natural Health, Natural Medicine, he produced a series of three \"how-to\" manuals on wellness and self-care, which established his current reputation as the people's doctor and \"America's most trusted medical expert.\" The next was Spontaneous Healing, and the third Eight Weeks to Optimum Health. These volumes follow the familiar, commercially tested patterns of health care manuals by offering their readers \"proven programs\" for achieving health and warding off disease. Advice on nutrition, herbal therapy, lifestyle, and environmental modifications, plus suggestions for psychological self-help, are liberally interspersed with anecdotes and testimonials about patients who are alleged to have achieved dramatic\u2014sometimes apparently miraculous\u2014results through the use of the recommended methods. The recommendations range from commonsensical, generally accepted, and medically sound advice on nutrition and modification of lifestyle to odd, almost bizarre recommendations that have nothing more than Weil's confident assurances and putative \"experience\" to back them up. Statements are usually made about the curative or preventive powers of some food or herb or healing practice, without the citation of any published evidence. Recipes abound, as do step-by-step guides for certain ritualistic health practices. The rituals and meditations contribute a quasi-religiosity to these practices, which undoubtedly enhance their appeal. All of this is pretty familiar stuff in the self-help medical literature, but Weil manages to make it dramatic and fresh enough to attract vast numbers of followers. The most recent of Weil's publications is Ask Dr. Weil, a compilation of questions and answers that have appeared on his website. To judge from the range of questions and the confidence with which they are answered, Weil considers himself an authority on almost every field in medicine. Like his previous books, it includes strong, unqualified recommendations for unlikely and totally unproven remedies, such as massive intravenous doses of Vitamin C to hasten the healing of surgical wounds, and homeopathic medicines and hypnotherapy for the treatment of lupus. It also includes perfectly sensible advice about diet, exercise, and stress reduction that would be given by almost any competent medical practitioner and would find abundant support in the standard medical literature. In addition to his books, other channels for the dissemination of Weil's medical wisdom include audiocassettes and compact discs on such subjects as \"Eight Meditations for Optimum Health\" and \"Sound Body, Sound Mind: Music for Healing with Andrew Weil, M.D.\" His influence is also spread through videotapes of lectures and seminars, and appearances on television shows such as \"Larry King Live.\" Even when compared with the ballyhoo surrounding the other icons of alternative medicine, the marketing success of \"Andrew Weil, M.D.\" is extraordinary. To understand it, one has to appreciate the synergistic interaction between the special talents of the man and the current momentum of the alternative medicine movement. The alternative medicine movement has been around for a long time, but it was eclipsed during most of this century by the success of medical science. Now there is growing public disenchantment with the cost and the impersonality of modern medical care, as well as concern about medical mistakes and the complications and side-effects of pharmaceuticals and other forms of medical treatment. For their part, physicians have allowed the public to perceive them as uninterested in personal problems, as inaccessible to their patients except when carrying out technical procedures and surgical operations. The \"doctor knows best\" attitude, which dominated patient-doctor relations during most of the century, has in recent decades given way to a more activist, consumer-oriented view of the patient's role. Moreover, many other licensed health-care professionals, such as nurse-practitioners, psychotherapists, pharmacists, and chiropractors, are providing services once exclusively reserved to allopathic physicians. The net result of all these developments has been a weakening of the hegemony that allopathic medicine once exercised over the health care system, and a growing interest by the public in exploring other healing approaches. The authority of allopathic medicine is also being challenged by a swelling current of mysticism and anti-scientism that runs deep through our culture. Even as the number and the complexity of urgent technological and scientific issues facing contemporary society increase, there seems to be a growing public distrust of the scientific outlook and a reawakening of interest in mysticism and spiritualism. All this obscurantism has given powerful impetus to the alternative medicine movement, with its emphasis on the power of mind over matter. And so consumer demand for alternative remedies is rising, as is public and private financial support for their study and clinical use. It is no wonder that practicing physicians, the academic medical establishment, and the National Institutes of Health are all finding reasons to pay more attention to the alternative medicine movement. Indeed, it is becoming politically incorrect for the movement's critics to express their skepticism too strongly in public. Weil would seem at first to be ideally suited to be a leader of the alternative medicine movement at this juncture. He is articulate, self-assured, intellectually nimble\u2014and wonderfully ambiguous. Ambiguity, after all, should be helpful to those who would defend systems of healing that are based on irrational or non-existent theories and are supported by no credible empirical evidence. But Weil wants to do more than to defend and to advocate the use of alternative healing. He wants to reform the medical establishment. His goal, he says, is to change the \"paradigm\" of medicine by integrating alternative methods and modes of thought into the teachings and practice of mainstream medicine. That is his declared mission at the University of Arizona College of Medicine. He seems to believe that he is qualified to accomplish this great reform because he has no difficulty in arguing on both sides of the debate between alternative and traditional healing. In an interview he gave last year, when asked whether he sometimes feels torn between his traditional medical training at Harvard and the new alternatives, Weil replied: \"I really think I'm in the middle. Sometimes I'm attacking traditional medicine, sometimes I'm defending it; sometimes I'm defending alternative medicine and sometimes attacking it, so I think I'm pretty even-handed in my criticism. I'm unique in that I'm not aligned with any one school of thought.\" That may be how Weil really thinks about himself and his \"integrative\" approach, but on close examination his position makes little sense. He cannot have the argument both ways. As Weil clearly points out in his earlier books, alternative healing is based on a conception of nature and a theory of learning the truth about nature that is fundamentally at odds with the \"straight,\" evidence-based thinking of mainstream medicine. As defined by Weil, and by most of the other gurus of alternative medicine, alternative and mainstream medicine are not simply different methods of treating illness. They are basically incompatible views of reality and how the material world works, and they cannot easily be combined into any rational and coherent \"integrated\" curriculum. Is there an objective real world out there, of which human bodies are a part? If so, how do we learn about it? How do we determine whether a method of healing is effective or not? Do we follow the universal rule of science, as explained by Feynman, that objective, verifiable observation is the ultimate and final judge of the truth of an idea, or do we use the subjective methods advocated by the alternative medicine gurus and described by Weil in his \"Stonesville\" chapter? Without agreement on such basic issues, it is hard to know what Weil means by being \"even-handed\" in dealing with the two types of medical practice. Sometimes he seems to believe in the primacy of objective evidence and talks like a scientist, but more often he does not. This is inconsistency and confusion, not even-handedness. It is hardly a useful basis for the \"new paradigm\" of \"integrative medicine\" that Weil is promoting. There is no doubt that modern medicine as it is now practiced needs to improve its relations with patients, and that some of the criticisms leveled against it by people such as Weil\u2014and by many more within the medical establishment itself\u2014are valid. There also can be no doubt that a few of the \"natural\" medicines and healing methods now being used by practitioners of alternative medicine will prove, after testing, to be safe and effective. This, after all, has been the way in which many important therapeutic agents and treatments have found their way into standard medical practice in the past. Mainstream medicine should continue to be open to the testing of selected unconventional treatments. In keeping an open mind, however, the medical establishment in this country must not lose its scientific compass or weaken its commitment to rational thought and the rule of evidence. There are not two kinds of medicine, one conventional and the other unconventional, that can be practiced jointly in a new kind of \"integrative medicine.\" Nor, as Andrew Weil and his friends also would have us believe, are there two kinds of thinking, or two ways to find out which treatments work and which do not. In the best kind of medical practice, all proposed treatments must be tested objectively. In the end, there will only be treatments that pass that test and those that do not, those that are proven worthwhile and those that are not. Can there be any reasonable \"alternative\"? Additional Perspectives - Further comments made by Dr. Relman during a debate with Dr. Weil held in 1999. [Andrew Weil's Vitamin \"New Age\"?](https://quackwatch.org/homeopathy/articles/wagner/) Homeopathy has existed for about 200 years, yet reports in the media have suggested that homeopathy is the medicine of the future. Today, homeopathy is found in almost every country. In Europe, 40% of French physicians use homeopathy; 40% of Dutch, 37% of British, and 20% of German physicians use homeopathy [1]. In the United States, hundreds of thousands of people take homeopathic remedies each year. Indeed, homeopathy seems to be becoming more popular. Background History Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician, developed homeopathy in about 1796. He was dissatisfied with the conventional medicine of his time. The accepted medical remedies at that time were often dangerous for the patient. There was a joke that more people died of medical treatment than from the disease itself. ... Homeopathy has existed for about 200 years, yet reports in the media have suggested that homeopathy is the medicine of the future. Today, homeopathy is found in almost every country. In Europe, 40% of French physicians use homeopathy; 40% of Dutch, 37% of British, and 20% of German physicians use homeopathy [1]. In the United States, hundreds of thousands of people take homeopathic remedies each year. Indeed, homeopathy seems to be becoming more popular. Background History Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician, developed homeopathy in about 1796. He was dissatisfied with the conventional medicine of his time. The accepted medical remedies at that time were often dangerous for the patient. There was a joke that more people died of medical treatment than from the disease itself. Hahnemann laid out two principles of his homeopathy. First, he said that \"like cures like\" (Similia similibus curentur). This meant that a substance that produces certain symptoms in a healthy person can be used to cure similar symptoms in a sick person. Second, Hahnemann asserted that smaller and smaller doses of the remedy would be even more effective. (In a way, perhaps this was a good idea because some of Hahnemann's remedies were poisonous.) So Hahnemann used more and more extreme dilutions of the remedies. In a process he named \"potentization,\" Hahnemann would take an original natural substance and often dilute it 1-to-99 (called \"C1\"). A second dilution of 1-to-99 would be called \"C2.\" Between each dilution, the remedy must be vigorously shaken. This shaking, or succussion, supposedly released the healing energy of the remedy. This healing energy has never been adequately defined nor measured. Hahnemann found C30 dilutions to be quite effective. For Hahnemann, these very high dilutions presented no problem. He did not believe in atoms, and he thought that matter could be divided endlessly. Today we know that any dilution greater than C12 is unlikely to contain even one single molecule of the remedy. Sometimes Hahnemann diluted a substance 1-to-9 (called \"D1\"). In this case any dilution of D24 or greater would also not likely contain any molecules of the remedy. Remedies Used Homeopathy claims to use only \"natural\" substances. This is an attempt to contrast itself with conventional medicine. For example, homeopathic remedies include raw bovine testicles, crushed honey bees (Apis mellifica), Belladonna (deadly nightshade), cadmium, sulfur, poison nut (Conium), silica (Silicea), monkshood (Aconite), salt (Natrium snake poison ivy (Rhus toxicodendron), and more. Some of these substances are quite harmless, but others can be toxic (especially at D4 and lower dilutions). How did Hahnemann know that a remedy was appropriate for a particular disease (actually for a particular symptom)? Hahnemann and his students tested remedies on themselves. They would eat various plant, animal, and mineral substances and carefully observe what symptoms occurred. This is called \"proving.\" These reactions (or symptoms) were collected together into a book Materia Medica. For example, one of the symptoms of Pulsatilla (windflower) is \"An unpleasant message makes him deeply sad and depressed after 20 hours.\" During provings, the people knew which substance they were taking. This is a problem because one might anticipate a certain reaction or exaggerate some symptom. Today, in modern science, we try to prevent this bias by not letting the person know what he or she is taking \u2014 a \"test-blind\" procedure. When evaluating symptoms, it is also important that the researcher does not know which remedy is being tested (a double-blind procedure) because the researcher can also be biased. One recent German study [2] did compare a remedy (Belladonna C30) to a placebo. Those who received the placebo reported even more symptoms than those who received the remedy. The symptoms reported included minor aches and pains in various parts of the body. Did the patient mistakenly assume that a normal ache or pain must be related to the remedy? It is possible that the ache or pain was the result of a confounding factor such as not enough sleep. As we can see, homeopathy is not concerned with the disease. It concentrates on the symptoms reported by the patient. Homeopathy then matches these symptoms to those symptoms that a remedy causes in a healthy person. By contrast, scientific bio-medicine uses symptoms to identify the disease and then treats the disease itself. Research There are two points of view about homeopathy that are in conflict. One viewpoint says that homeopathy should not attempt to meet the rigorous requirements of scientific medicine. It is sufficient that there have been millions of satisfied patients during the last 200 years. Science is not relevant anyway because it rejects the concept of the energy of the \"vital force\" which is essential to homeopathy. This vital force is identical to the concept of vitalism \u2014 a primitive concept used to explain health and disease. And, besides, scientific medicine is unfairly prejudiced and biased against homeopathy. Dana Ullman [3], a leading spokesman for American homeopathy, says that personal experience is much more convincing than any experiments. The emphasis on experience shows that most people simply do not understand that good science, based upon experiments, is essential to the development of knowledge. The second viewpoint is that scientific research is necessary if homeopathy is to be accepted by medicine and society. In the past 15 years many experimental studies have been done to examine homeopathic remedies. Two reviews of homeopathy are perhaps the best known. J. Kleinjen, P. Knipschild, and G. ter Riet[4] examined 107 controlled clinical trials of homeopathy. They concluded that the evidence was not sufficient to support the claims of homeopathy. C. Hill and F. Doyon [5] examined 40 other clinical studies. They also concluded that there was no acceptable evidence that homeopathy is effective. Since the above reviews were written, four more research studies have appeared. In 1992 the homeopathic treatment of plantar warts (on the feet) was examined [6]. The homeopathic treatment was no more effective than a placebo. A report in May 1994 examined the homeopathic treatment of diarrhea in children who lived in Nicaragua [7]. On Day 3 of treatment the homeopathic group had one less unformed stool than the control group (3.1 Vs 2.1; p <.05). However, critics [8] pointed out that not only were the sickest children excluded, but there were no significant differences on Days 1, 2, 4, or 5. This suggests that the conclusion was not valid. Further, there was no assurance that the homeopathic remedy was not adulterated (contaminated). Finally, standard remedies which halt diarrhea were not used for comparison purposes. In November 1994 a research report examined the effects of homeopathic remedies in children with upper respiratory infections (such as a cold) [9]. Eighty-four children received the placebo, and 86 received individualized homeopathic remedies. The researchers concluded that the remedies produced no improvement in symptoms or in the infections. In December 1994 a fourth study examined homeopathic treatment of allergic asthma in Scotland [10]. The 13 patients who received the homeopathic remedy reported feeling better and breathing easier than the 15 patients who received the placebo. Then the researchers combined these data with several earlier experiments. They concluded that, in general, homeopathy is not a placebo and that homeopathy is reproducible. However, there were too few patients for significant analysis. Second, personal reports of feeling better are not reliable. If a patient feels better, is that proof of recovering from the ailment? There are many diseases in which the patient feels good but is actually quite sick. What is needed are several proper physiological measurements of improvement. Third, it is inappropriate to combine this small study with previous studies of a different disorder. The latest study from Norway [11] examined relief from the pain of tooth extraction/oral surgery by homeopathic remedies or placebos. Fourteen of the 24 subjects were students of homeopathy, and 2 of the 5 authors were homeopaths. It is safe to say that motivation was high to have homeopathy succeed. However, no positive evidence was found favoring homeopathy, either in relief of pain or inflammation of tissue. The reader may ask why so much attention has been given to the scientific research when supporters of homeopathy reject the relevance of clinical trials to establish its validity. But the same people also claim that the 1991 review, and the Nicaragua and the Scotland studies are proof that homeopathy does indeed work. It is important to realize that all of the research that seems to support homeopathy is seriously flawed. The only conclusion that is justified at this time is that research has not conclusively shown that homeopathic remedies are effective. Homeopathic Pleading What answer can be given to someone who says he took a remedy and it worked? Most people do not realize that in time most conditions will get better even if nothing is done. As the saying goes, \"A cold will get better in 14 long days without treatment, but will get better in only two short weeks with medication.\" A wise medical doctor will say not to worry, that medication won't help much. (By the way, has anyone ever heard of a homeopath telling a patient that they need not worry and that the sickness will go away by itself?) When someone says the homeopathic remedy cured them, we can ask: \"Would one have been cured just as quickly if nothing had been done?\" Another factor to consider is the \"placebo effect.\" This means that if people \"believe\" that they are being properly treated, they will perceive themselves getting better faster. Recent research shows that up to 70% of medical/surgical patients will report good results from techniques that we know today are ineffective [12]. (At the time of the treatment, both the patient and the physician were convinced that the treatment was effective.) Since 1842, homeopaths have argued that the placebo argument is irrelevant because children and animals are helped by homeopathic remedies. But children and animals respond to suggestion when researchers and often the parents and pet owners are aware that a remedy has been given. Supporters also claim that there are no risks from homeopathic treatment. They say that the ultra dilute remedies are safer and cheaper than most prescription drugs. First, it has been shown that several homeopathic remedies for asthma actually were contaminated with large amounts of artificial steroids. Second, some remedies do contain measurable amounts of the critical substance. If a patient takes 4 tablets daily of mercury (D4), he would receive a potentially toxic dose. And a dose of D6 cadmium exceeds the safe limits. Finally, a D6 or less dose of Aristolochia contains significant amounts of this cancer-causing herb. Therefore, we cannot easily and quickly claim that homeopathic remedies are always safe. There is an additional risk of seeking homeopathic treatment. If someone is ill and requires immediate medical treatment, any delay could have serious consequences. This is the risk that is present with all alternative medical care. Advocates of homeopathy often assert that using dilute remedies is similar to vaccinations. After all, vaccinations also use very dilute substances. Once again, homeopathy is trying to obtain respectability by showing that conventional medicine uses similar procedures. This is misleading for several reasons. First, vaccinations are used to prevent disease. Once one is sick and has symptoms, a vaccination will not help. The homeopathic remedy is given only after one is already sick. Vaccinations use similar or identical weakened microorganisms, but homeopathy is concerned with similar symptoms of illness. And last, many homeopathic remedies use D24 or C12 dilutions where none of the substance remains. Vaccinations on the other hand must contain a measurable amount of the microorganism or its protein. Strange Bedfellows Sometimes we can learn much about a topic by examining who or what it associates with. In the first 100 years, homeopathy was closely associated with many pseudosciences including Mesmerism and phrenology. In the United States, many early homeopaths were members of the mystical cult of Swedenborgianism. Unfortunately, this has not changed today. Especially in the United States, chiropractic (spinal manipulation therapy) and applied kinesiology use homeopathic remedies. Many homeopaths use iridology, reflexology, dowsing, and electrodiagnosis. None of these methods has scientific validity. In America, if you want to learn more about homeopathy, the best place to go is to any New Age bookstore or meeting place. Another connection of homeopathy with the New Age movement is found in the emphasis upon some mystical energy (called the \"vital force\") which, though unquantifiable, supposedly permeates the universe and is responsible for healing. Fritjof Capra and Deepak Chopra claim that the mysteries of quantum physics support this \"healing energy\" concept. But Victor Stenger [13] has shown that all of modern physics (including quantum physics) remains materialistic and reductionistic and offers no support for the mysterious energy supposedly present in potentized homeopathic remedies at dilutions of C12 or greater. Is Homeopathy Quackery? In the United States, we have a motto: \"If it walks like a duck, and looks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\" To what extent does homeopathy look like quackery and sound like quackery? One clear link that homeopathy has to quackery is its supporters' use of faulty logic. The first example is known as the \"test of time\" argument \u2014 the fact that homeopathy has existed for a long time shows that it is valid. But longevity does not guarantee validity. Astrology, numerology, and dowsing have been around for a long time, but they are clear examples of pseudoscience. Longevity of an idea is never a good substitute for rigorous science. The second argument is that many people have tried homeopathic remedies and are all satisfied, so homeopathy must be legitimate. Along the same lines, we are told that the following famous and important people all supported homeopathy: The British royal family, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa, Mark Twain, O. J. Simpson, Yehudi Menuhin, Angela Lansbury, and Mary Baker Eddy (founder of Christian Science). The Chinese have a saying that if a thousand people say something foolish, it is still foolish. Also a majority vote is no substitute for good science. In addition, we usually hear only about the successes, but the failures are conveniently forgotten or ignored. A third argument is the \"non sequitur.\" Typically, the crackpot says: \"They laughed at Galileo, and he was right. Today they laugh at me; therefore I must be right.\" (Actually Galileo was not laughed at. Rather he was persecuted because he was devoid of a proper Christian faith to accept the correct dogma.) Homeopaths say that throughout history many great geniuses have rebelled against the prevailing wisdom; many of these were ultimately recognized as correct. Paracelsus, William Harvey, Louis Pasteur, and Joseph Lister were vindicated by history. Therefore, it is argued, Samuel Hahnemann and homeopathy also will ultimately be recognized as correct. But this argument forgets that many more who claimed to be geniuses were correctly rejected. In the spirit of fair-mindedness, one may be tempted to give homeopathy the benefit of the doubt and simply conclude \"not yet proven.\" However, what then are we to do when many lay practitioners report that merely writing the name of the remedy on a piece of paper, and putting this on the body of the patient results in a \"cure.\" Even two respected national spokesmen were unwilling to reject these reports, and one of them suggested that quantum physics may ultimately explain these healings as well as those reported by patients who are given the remedy over the phone. We must conclude that homeopathy certainly sounds like quackery. Homeopathy in the United States Before 1920, homeopathy was extremely popular in the United States. There were many homeopathic hospitals and medical colleges. But then conventional medicine established more rigorous standards for training students. In addition, pharmacology and the discovery of many useful drugs happened at the same time. Today in the United States, only about 500 of more than 600,000 physicians use homeopathic remedies. However, many scientists are concerned because the popularity of homeopathy is increasing. Today almost anyone can buy homeopathic remedies without a prescription. This is because in 1938 a homeopath who also was a powerful politician (Royal Copeland, MD) was able to have a law passed that made homeopathic remedies exempt from all drug regulation. So homeopathic remedies do not have to be proved effective, as all other drugs must be. In addition, many unlicensed and untrained people can give homeopathic remedies to anyone who asks for them. Both German and French homeopathic companies recognize the large potential American market for their remedies. Sales of remedies are growing by 30% a year, and most remedies are sold in New Age and related natural health-food stores. Therefore, there is no control over the quality of homeopathic treatment received by patients; nor is there control over the quality or purity of the remedies. Why Do People Accept Homeopathy? Perhaps there are really two different questions here. The first question relates to the New Age in general. The second question relates to many alternative medicines as well as homeopathy. Why do people read their horoscopes? Why do people believe in good luck and bad luck? Why do people ask a dowser for help? Why do people visit fortune-tellers? People who do these things want to know about the future, to avoid uncertainty, and to take control of their lives. For many people the uncertainty in life is unbearable. These people want explanations that they can understand. Modern science has become so complex that many people turn away in frustration. It is unfortunate that most people throughout the world do not understand what science is and what science does. For example, how many people can explain why it is warmer in the summer than in the winter? (Only 2 of 23 recent Harvard graduates could mention the tilt of the earth's axis[14].) Or how many people understand the basic ideas of biological evolution? A survey by the National Science Foundation in May 1966 reported that 48% of American adults believe that humans and dinosaurs coexisted, and only 47% knew that it takes one year for the earth to go around the sun. This scientific illiteracy, due in part to the shortcomings in our education systems, makes it easy for pseudoscience and superstition to succeed. Why do people turn to homeopathy and other \"alternative\" medicines? Many people are dissatisfied with conventional medicine. They distrust physicians who may prescribe expensive drugs or painful surgery. Often physicians can find nothing wrong with the patient. Or else they tell the patient that time alone will cure the ailment. And, of course, physicians often cannot spend much time talking with the patient because they have too many patients to see that day. If the physician finds nothing wrong, this may offend the patient because it suggests that the cause is psychosomatic. The patient who wants to be cured and to be cured immediately is upset when the physician says that time alone will cure the problem. The patient may also be unhappy if the physician doesn't give some medication. An initial visit to a homeopath can often take more than one hour. Patients are encouraged to talk about all of their cares, concerns, and pains. Patients may be asked whether they like oranges or apples; what kinds of music they enjoy; whether they sleep on their back or on their side. Later the homeopath tells a patient that because he is a unique individual, the remedy will also be individualized for that patient alone. Thus, homeopathy is seductive to both the patient and the physician. The patient and physician become partners in fighting the illness. The homeopath is seen as a concerned and sympathetic health-care giver. Conclusions It must be concluded that by every objective, rational, and medical standard, homeopathy has failed to establish its scientific credibility. Homeopathy has not cast off the many characteristics of pseudoscience and quackery. How can conventional medicine, science, and patients respond to this challenge? The problem of scientific illiteracy must be acknowledged. For example, if people understood the influence of suggestion and the placebo effect more clearly, homeopathy's attraction might diminish. Intelligent people can encourage others to think more critically. Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. A miracle means a violation of the laws of nature. A miracle cure probably is not a miracle at all. If something seems too amazing to be true, it probably isn't true. We must demand that the claims of diagnosis and cure be supported with good evidence. To paraphrase another American motto: \"The only thing necessary for quackery to succeed is for intelligent people to do nothing.\" References - Fisher P, Ward A. Complementary medicine in Europe.

Weird though it sounds, they actually work.\" They certainly look weird. They're so tiny, your heel hangs off the back. People might think you borrowed them from a nine-year-old. But the Get Slim web site quotes a lot of wearers who swear by these things. One is Megan McCarver, a certified yoga instructor, who says, \"Wearing them only 15 minutes a day will tone you from the inside out, causing you to shed inches as well as weight!\" [The site's \"Reflexology\" page promises even more](http://www.getslimslippers.com/html/reflexology.shtm): According to Reflexology, Acu-Point Channels and Chinese Medicines, a regular foot massage will increase your lifespan by helping to balance your body. Unlike western medicine practices, which focus strictly on symptom relief, eastern medicine focuses on correcting the source of the health problem. However, correcting the source takes time. For every organ in our bodies, there is a corresponding area on the soles of our feet. The purpose of the Slipper is to stimulate the areas that effect digestion and weight control, such as the Stomach, both Intestines, Liver and Kidneys, with magnets and pressure point therapy. The Get Slim Slippers are designed with No Heel, and a bulgy middle that, when combined with powerful magnets, stimulate the untouched sole of the foot, thus activating the nerves responsible for digestion and eating habits. The side effect is you lose weight. The \"Additional Information from a Scientific Perspective\" page explains further: 1st: They make you laugh at the sight of them! That's excellent for endorphin flow through the body.... 2nd: The slippers shape and magnets placement \"tone\" the digestive tract with strategic stimulation to the reflex zones and acupuncture meridians responsible for affecting the entire abdominal cavity, including reflex areas for the thyroid gland\u2014which is so critical in metabolism. 3rd: The actual structural foot placement in the slipper with the heel of the foot left\"dangling\" off the back, begins to align posture\u2014taking pressure off the spinal column and potentially relieving typical low back pain, and continuing to correct shoulder and neck distress. When the body is structurally aligned, the internal organs also rest more comfortably within the cavities. At least two processes occur when that is the case. (1) Absorption of nutrition becomes better. (2) The need or craving for food as compensation for discomfort of pain or fear quietly diminishes. . . . Even if weight is not an issue, people seem attracted to the slippers as they seem to boost energy, help posture, and generally uplift one's spirit when worn and walked in for just a minimum 15 minutes a day. The first, most noticeable effect in more trim people is a looseness at the waistbands of pants and skirts as well as a difference in digestive processing. Another page (Get Slim Slippers The 'Magical' Shoes\") offers insights attributed to an Israeli \"reflexology specialist\" who explains that the construction of the slippers forces postural changes that automatically tighten the abdominal muscles and causes the sensation of \"gathering in.\" Then: This 'ingathering' of the organs results in the following: women will suffer less from bladder/kidney problems; the intestines will work more regularly; people suffering from vein problems or sluggish feet will feel lighter and have less pressure on the veins. In addition, there's a possibility that hemorrhoids will disappear. Continued usage will influence the upper body. This is because as soon as the waist is released from pressure, the burden will lift off the shoulders and neck area. This results in more efficiency in the area of the chest, in breathing, in alertness, and less throat infections. Because Get Slim Slippers strengthen the lower abdominal and waist areas, they actually rehabilitate two of the most important central systems of the body. One is found in the lower abdomen and connects to the existing fears, (notice how we feel fear as abdominal distress), the second, happiness in life and vitality. The magnets in Get Slim Slippers are located in the high arch of the sole of the foot\u2014which is the area that controls the stomach organs, liver, kidneys, digestive system, and the bladder. The magnets stimulate the nerves in that layout and pain is relieved in its parallels. At this point, blood circulation is regulated in the area. Getting fat is a result of the inner system being sluggish. A tired digestive system is equal to a slow metabolism/ thyroid and loose muscles. With the help of Get Slim Slippers, the muscles get stronger and the digestive system works more efficiently. On the mental level, as we fear less, we lose less energy and we need less food. I don't know about you, but if I could lose weight, live longer, and enjoy the health benefits listed above just by wearing slippers, I wouldn't care how silly I looked in them. In fact, I'd be willing to pay thousands of dollars for the opportunity. Yet these cost only $49.99. \"Give Me Two Pairs\" To learn more, I phoned Get Slim's 800 number and got Thia Smith, a Californian who helped to introduce the slippers to this country. (They're from China.) I told her that my company ( [DietPower](http://www.dietpower.com/)) wanted to test the slippers and, if they proved effective, consider selling them in our online health shop. \"How do these things work, anyway?\" I asked. \"They're a tool that causes your heart to beat faster and your metabolism to run faster,\" Smith explained. \"They're based on time-honored principles, especially reflexology.\" Reflexology claims to speed blood to certain organs by massaging \"pressure points\" on the hands, feet, or other body parts. By supporting your weight on your instep instead of your heel, Smith said, Get Slim slippers massage pressure points connected to the heart and digestive organs. In addition, she said, embedded in each slipper are three strategically placed magnets. These, too, influence the digestive system. Together, she said, the magnets and the foot massage cause your body to burn more calories, leading to effortless weight loss. Or at least that's the theory. \"We're the first ones to say these aren't based on science,\" Smith said. \"But they do work. We have thousands of customers who say so.\" Indeed, Get Slim's web site is peppered with testimonials. \" I've lost 20 lbs in 10 weeks,\" writes Lisa Lisnek. \"I know it is the Slippers because nothing else is different in my routine.\" And Johnella Ellis writes, \"I'm constant losing weight, and keeping it off. I have more energy, too.\" When I asked Smith how she got into this business, she said that her boyfriend's father's best friend's son, who runs the factory in China that produces the slippers, gave her a pair when he visited the United States. \"I was skeptical at first,\" she said. \"Then I noticed after three or four weeks that my pants were looser.\" She discovered she had lost eight pounds. The slippers were already popular in China, she said, \"and I thought it unfair that we didn't have them in this country.\" At the end of the call, I said, \"Give me two pairs.\" With a $10 discount for the multiple order, my total came to $90 plus $6.95 for shipping and handling. \"Loosing Weight!\" The slippers arrived a couple of days later, neatly housed in a polyethylene zip bag. They had tough, cellulose-like soles and tastefully-printed canvas tops. They were amazingly lightweight\u2014only three ounces each. The bag also contained a user's manual and a message from Chai Chalamish, CEO of Get Slim's parent company (Digicom-Matsu Industries, Inc.) in Los Angeles. The message said, \"Only by following the instructions will the Slippers make a change in your life. Respect and be One with the Slippers.\" I wasn't sure how to follow that instruction, so I began reading those in the manual. The manual was littered with spelling and grammatical errors. (\"The side effect is you loosing weight!\") Clearly this was no Fortune 500 company. But the manual did declare, in no uncertain terms, that the slippers \"will help you in getting slimmer.\" It said each user reacts differently, though: \"Some could lose up to 14 pounds in 21 days, however others could loose only 10 pounds after 40 days.\" The directions were simple: Wear the slippers only 15 minutes the first day, and gradually build up to longer periods\u2014but not more than 2-1/2 hours a day. \"Wearing the slippers while sitting will not be effective,\" it said. I would have to walk in them. If I followed these rules, the manual said, I would notice effects \"after a mimimum of 3 weeks.\" I spent the rest of the day practicing my pronunciation of the word mimimum. Amazing Results I wore the slippers faithfully for a month. Since I spend most of my days sitting at my computer, I used a stopwatch to keep track of the time I actually walked in them. Although I wore them an average of 3.3 hours per day, my walking time averaged 25 minutes. I obeyed all the instructions. I started off gradually. In fact I had to\u2014my arches, bearing almost all of my weight, hurt fiercely the first few days. (If you've ever climbed a round-runged ladder in your bare feet, you know the feeling.) I never went over the 2-1/2-hour limit, and I tried to \"respect the slippers\" in spite of jeers from my office mates. In a sense, I even \"became One with the slippers\"\u2014they delivered a terrible foot odor each time I took them off. Apparently, the canvas uppers don't \"breathe.\" I didn't change anything else in my routine. I got almost no exercise. (A calf injury had put a stop to my daily jog more than a month before.) And according to DietPower, my diet remained remarkably stable: my daily calorie intake stayed within 10% of last year's average, and my percentage of calories from fat, carbohydrate, and protein changed by no more than a single point each. Meanwhile, I monitored three other things: - My weight, using our Tanita body-fat scale. (It's accurate to 0.2 pounds.) - My metabolic rate, using DietPower nutrition software. (Your metabolic rate is the number of calories needed to maintain your weight. DietPower recalculates it every day by analyzing your exercise, food, and weight logs.) - My resting pulse. The results of this 30-day test were amazing: - Instead of losing weight, I gained 3.0 pounds. - Instead of rising, my metabolic rate plummeted\u2014from 2695 calories per day to 2312. - My pulse did not change significantly. In other words, if the slippers had any effect at all, it appeared to be the opposite of what the company claimed. I had given the second pair of slippers to a friend in Washington, D.C., who lost 64 pounds last year with the help of DietPower. She had agreed to stop using DietPower and wear the slippers instead. I phoned her up. \"So how'd the slippers work?\" I asked. \"Awful,\" she said. \"I only wore them a couple of times. They're so intensely uncomfortable, I just couldn't keep it up. I figured just having them in the vicinity might be of some help, though\u2014because of the magnets. But I've done nothing but eat and gain weight since trying them. They failed miserably.\" I wasn't surprised at these results. There is no credible scientific evidence that either reflexology or magnets can do what Get Slim claims. [Reflexology has no scientific basis](../../reflex.html). Although reflexologists claim that manipulating pressure points can enhance the flow of \"energy\" to various organs, they have never identified the physical pathways involved. Nor have they proven their claims with controlled scientific experiments. And most studies of static magnets (the kind used in footware) have found no measurable effect on any body function. Work \"Like Magic\" in Israel A few days after my trial period ended, I phoned Get Slim's 800 number again. This time I got Mr. Chalamish, the company's CEO. (Thia Smith had left the company three weeks earlier, he said.) In an accent that I had trouble deciphering (he's an Israeli who has lived in China for ten years), Chalamish told me that the reason I hadn't gotten any results was simple: I hadn't followed the instructions. I had walked in the slippers only 25 minutes a day. \"It's an improvement of day and night if you get to the two hours,\" he said. \"What two hours?\" I said. \"The manual doesn't say that.\" \"Yes it does.\" He directed me to the sentence warning that people shouldn't wear the slippers more than two and a half hours a day. \"That's a caution, not a recommendation,\" I said. \"If you want people to wear them at least two hours, why doesn't the manual say so?\" \"Because what happens, people don't want to take them off.\" \"'Pardon?\" \"With this slipper you feel you are walking on air. You feel uplifting.\" Clearly we were not communicating. But after a few minutes of back-and-forth, Chalamish finally got his point across: some people lose weight wearing the slippers only 20 or 30 minutes a day, but others\u2014like me\u2014need two hours. I asked Chalamish whether he had controlled studies proving the weight-loss effect. \"No,\" he said. \"We started selling only last October.\" \"Most companies test their products before they sell them, don't they?\" I said politely. \"Well, we tested in Israel first. We exported to Israel two years ago, and it's working like magic there.\" He said his father and mother had tried the slippers and ended up ordering dozens of pairs for their Israeli friends. I reminded him that in any group of people given a medical device, there will always be a few whose health improves and who believe it's because of the device. He replied that he knew the slippers worked, \"because the people would not have written us letters if it didn't.\" Finally, I questioned him on the two therapies that the slippers are said to exploit. I asked whether he could point to any studies proving the effectiveness of reflexology. \"It's a science,\" he said. \"You can study it at a university.\" I also inquired about studies demonstrating the health benefits of magnets. \"I cannot tell you any right now,\" he said. \"But magnet studies are all over.\" Eventually, I learned that Chalamish was not a medical expert; his field is electronics. His company's chief products are baby monitors, video door phones, alarms, and other security devices. The conversation ended with Chalamish urging me again to walk in the slippers at least two hours per day. My daily jog won't count, because I'm not supposed to run in the slippers. (I have no temptation to do this. Just thinking about it makes me wince.) Since I don't have two hours per day to walk (nor do most Americans\u2014they average about half that much), I've decided to retire the slippers for now. (I gave one to Wally the Schnauzer. So far, he hasn't touched it.) If anyone out there has better evidence that they work, contact me. Maybe I can be persuaded to rearrange my schedule for a second test. But I doubt it. The Press Weighs In At bottom, I think Get Slim's claims are laughable. Yet the American press, always eager for a good story, has latched onto these slippers like a hyperactive puppy. The Get Slim web site lists 25 items in newspapers, magazines, and TV and radio broadcasts, ranging from the New York Daily News to local CBS, NBC, and Fox affiliates. A few items appear to have been ads, but the National Examiner's story is headlined, \"Magnetic Slimming Slippers Turn Your Body into A Fat-Burning Machine.\" My quick review of this coverage shows reporters blithely parroting the company's claims. They insert the usual qualifiers (\"according to the company,\" \"a company spokesman says\"). But they don't bother to check the claims with credible scientific or medical authorities. That, after all, is beside the point. Journalism these days is not about seeking the truth. It's about selling newspapers or getting a chuckle between commercials. By the way, six of the people whose testimonials appear on Get Slim's \"Jussta\" (no last name)\u2014are identified on the site as Get Slim dealers. This article was posted on February 28, 2002.

E. Patrick CurryJames S. Gordon, M.D., the Clinton Administration's appointee as chairman of the [White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP)](https://www.whccamp.hhs.gov/), has written about his experiences as a student of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. His book The Golden Guru: The Strange Jouney of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Stephen Greene Press, Lexington, Mass, 1988) purports to be a psychological analysis of his teacher's descent into authoritarianism. The book presents Gordon's theories about authoritarianism, but it also attributes \"wisdom and generosity\" to behavior that most people would regard as purely malignant. Gordon's \"Rebirth\" In 1979, Gordon traveled to Poona, India, at his own expense after his request for a National Institute of Mental Health grant to study Rajneesh's commune had been quashed by the State Department, which considered the organization to be a dangerous cult similar to Jim Jones' People's Temple. In Chapter 3 (\"Surrender to Bhagwan\"), Gordon describes the \"rebirthing\" experience he underwent during his one-month stay: Several days before I leave Poona . have . I am. . . particularly anxious to see what the combination of Rajneesh and rebirthing will be like. Rebirthers follow the theory of the psychoanalyst Otto Rank and the practice of Leonard Orr. They believe that only by reexperiencing the primal trauma of birth . . . can one undo the harm, the emotional and physical constriction, the fear and rage, that result from the abrupt transition from intrauterine peace to the cold, noisy, bright lights of the delivery room and the larger world. The technique is, I discover, remarkably simple. I am instructed to lie naked on a mat (sometimes rebirthing is done in water) and breathe deeply, in and out, through my mouth. In Poona, to my surprise, my rebirther, a beautiful, rather distant Danish blonde, takes off her clothes as well. She sits behind me, naked except for her mala [necklace with picture of Rajneesh], on a mattress. . . . My breathing begins to feel hoarse and raspy and my body begins to rock and flail. I know I am hyperventilating. The oxygen is accumulating and the carbon dioxide in my blood is decreasing . . . The woman touches me from time to time. . . . I am aware of some sort of raw force not exactly in her, but coming through her. It feels. . . like Rajneesh. . . . Now it is as if she is hardly there, a hollow reed, an instrument that Rajneesh is playing. My head feels terrible, constricted as if it is being crushed in a vice. I can barely breathe. I panic for a moment, feeling like I am going to suffocate, remembering the fear that haunted the moments before childhood sleep. My God, am I imagining this? Or is this really some bodily memory, a replay of my descent through the birth canal. There is agony in my right shoulder. It is being crushed toward my chest, tearing at my upper back in the place where tension always produces pain. I am terrified. Air is rushing in as if my mouth were a vacuum. I'm, shrieking now, an unearthly sound I have never consciously made before, drying, screaming. I am flailing on the mat, squalling like a newborn, feeling my mouth open, hearing the sound and marveling, as if at the first glimpse of an ancient relic. Gordon goes on like this for another page, then concludes: Nature is unfolding in me with enormous power and confidence. . . . I gather myself . . . there is no pain in the knees that have bothered me for years. . . . Even my aching lower back is straighter than any osteopath has ever made it. My eyes, when I look at them in a mirror, are as clear as a baby's. I look up now, away from my own face to Rajneesh's. He is looking down at me, smiling, impish, knowing. . . . I feel that he has made this experience possible, kicked my energy like some sluggish electron into a more excited, active, higher state. I feel gratitude and love, not so general now as in groups, but focused on Rajneesh, on his generosity. I feel clean, blissful, and \u2014 yes, I have to admit it \u2014 reborn. That's why they call it rebirthing, I giggle to myself. Defense of Violent Psychotherapy In Chapter 3, Gordon also responds to the charges that people are being sorely injured and even killed though violent encounter therapies at Poona,. Gordon defends violence as long as it is not \"self-indulgent\" or fatal: The violence had ended by the time I had gotten to Poona . . . but it still bothered me. It wasn't that I was against fighting in groups. I knew from years of psychiatric work and my own two years' experience in an encounter group that the potential for destructiveness was present in all of us, that some kind of controlled release coupled with awareness could be therapeutic \u2014 indeed, had been therapeutic for me. . . . Most [of the people at Poona] believed that the violent confrontations - - even their own bad bruises and broken limbs \u2014 had been a small and necessary price to pay for the freedom they now felt from past traumas and inhibitions, for the perspective they had gained on their own sadism and masochism. I could also see that violence in a few groups might in some way have helped to exorcise the community's latent collective violence. I knew too that spiritual teachers \u2014 Marpa with his disciple Milarepa, Gurdjieff, and many Zen masters \u2014 had sometimes used violence as a device to break down disciples' arrogance and resistance to change, to get them to see reality, including themselves, as they were. In this context, incitement to violence or acts of violence were just another aspect of what the Tibetan Buddhists called ati yana, the crazy wisdom of spontaneous and inexplicable but appropriate action. . . . Still I had my doubts about the value of violence in the groups. It was true that even with the hospitalizations and the two suicides, far fewer people were adversely affected than I would have expected with such powerful techniques used on so many thousands of unscreened participants. . . . In my own experience in America, violence had been controlled and contained, whereas in Poona it had . . . often become self-indulgent. Defense of Rajneesh's Wealth In Chapter 5 (\"The Rolls Royce Guru\"), Gordon excuses Rajneesh's ostentatious displays of wealth \u2014 which included 93 Rolls Royce cars \u2014 by classifying them as an \"obsessive symptom\" and later concluding that the possession of the cars was insignificant. In India, Rajneesh had been known as the sex guru, in America he was becoming known as the Rolls-Royce guru. He had always liked good and expensive cars and certainly he must have enjoyed even more the notoriety and confusion, the anger and envy, that his possession of so many \u2014 so absurdly, unnecessarily, outrageously many \u2014 of them aroused. Just as he enjoyed provoking the Gandhiites and ascetics in India, so he loved sticking it to America's puritans. In displaying his wealth so conspicuously, in ignoring accusations of selfishness, Rajneesh was mocking the preconceptions of his New World audience, who \u2014 particularly the Christians \u2014 who tended to associate spirituality with poverty, modesty, charity. He was telling them they were deluded, that wealth was \"immensely spiritual,\" a precondition for spirituality. Poverty was worse than useless, and voluntary poverty an inverted form of pride. He would, some time later, declare himself \"the rich man's guru\" and condemn charity as a tool for enslaving the poor and a salve for the guilty consciences of the rich. It seemed to me that at the same time Rajneesh was, a bit more subtly, putting us on. His display of wealth was a lampoon of the far greater wealth and power of the Pope and man of America's TV evangelists. They acted humble, if not poor, kissing the earth and praising the impoverished, emphasizing their own humble beginnings. In so doing, he seemed to be saying, they showed themselves to be hypocrites. Rajneesh was, he would have us believe, at least honest. He praised the wealth he enjoyed, condemned the poverty he avoided. A popular ranch bumper sticker read: \"Jesus Saves. Moses Invests. Bhagwan Spends.\" I found that my reactions to the cars were always changing..Initially I was repulsed. . . . Later in an analytic frame of mind, I classified Rajneesh's collecting as a symptom that had existed since childhood. I remember reading that when he was a boy his mother had sewn extra pockets in his pants so that he could collect more stones from a nearby beach . . . . later he collected books, then fountain pens, then hats and towels, then watches...and now finally, cars. Always the best and most expensive. It was, I concluded, a fixation.. The prepubescent boy's obsessive collecting \u2014 a kind of sublimated, anxiety-ridden greed \u2014 was preserved in the middle-aged man . . perhaps when he was satiated . . . the watches and cars would lose their meaning, too. . . . One morning I awakened and imagined a beneficent Bhagwan accumulating Rolls-Royces to show people that infinite wealth was available. All we had to do was live like the lilies in the field, trust existence in each moment, and everything would be given. The Rolls-Royces were simply symbols that those of us too stupid to get the message of the Sermon on the Mount might understand. Another time I focused on Rajneesh's ethnicity. How many Indian men had I seen who lavished more attention on their Rolex than on their wife? Rolls-Royces? Every maharaja worth the name had owned at least one. The motor car that was the pride of the colonizing British was the ultimate status symbol for the colonized. Tajneesh was simply one-upping all of them. Then, on another occasion, it hit me that the Rolls-Royces didn't mean anything at all. All the meanings that we were attributing to them were only reflections of our psyches. The cars were what Indians call a leela, a play. Their showy presence was merely a clever reminder that the whole of existence is just a play. Defense of Rajneesh's Unethical Recruiting Activity In the Fall of 1984, the Rajneeshees recruited hundreds of mentally ill and drug-addict street people to come to Oregon to vote as part of their plan to take over their section of rural Oregon through the ballot box. (Rajneeshees also inoculated salad bars with salmonella bacteria to keep local residents away from the polls.) Recruits were bussed to Oregon and subjected to Rajneeshee discipline. Some were drugged with Haldol. The Oregon Psychiatric Association and Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield spoke out strongly against the Rajneeshees, saying that they were manipulating these vulnerable people and often holding them against their will. Gordon was involved as a NIMH researcher, he claims \u2014 in Rajneesh's recruiting efforts in Washington, D.C.! In Chapter 7 (\"The Share-A-Home Campaign\"), he defends them: Psychiatry's record for dealing with the desperately needy and the homeless has been dismal. I can understand questioning the program [by the Oregon Psychiatric Assn] and especially wanting to learn from it, but accusations made without evidence have a hollow ring. The program, in spite of its inequities and exploitativeness, does seem a great improvement over what these men have been offered in city and state mental hospitals and shelters. Those who stay are functioning, useful members of a loving community. They seem to have a real opportunity to change. Lessons Learned from Rajneesh In the book's Epilogue, Gordon sums up what he has learned from his nearly 13 years as a student of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Nevertheless, during the last twenty years, the wisdom and generosity of the ideal Rajneesh offered have helped his sannyasins and me and many more people to see the generous, spontaneous, celebratory aspects of ourselves. His vision of a loving, cooperative community dedicated to the creation of new men and women living in harmony with their own nature and the natural world have provoked and inspired us. Similarly, his self-absorption, and self-deception, his destructive, controlling actions and his sannyasins' collaboration in them, can help show us our own willingness to be self-absorbed and destructive, to be controlled individually and in groups, and to deceive ourselves. The contradictions in Rajneesh and in his sannyasins remind us that the ideals to which we aspire and the flaws which we fear are both already present in us. For me, it is not finally a question of agreeing or disagreeing with Rajneesh, of praising or condemning him or his sannyasins. It is, rather, a matter of learning from him and them, of appreciating his remarkable talents and gifts and recognizing his perverse uses of them, of seeing myself in him and his sannyasins, of using his extraordinary story and strange, as yet unfinished journey as a mirror for my own. Do you think Dr. Gordon is fit to advise the President on how to restructure our health-care system and research priorities? __________________ Mr. Curry is a consumer health activist who resides in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

James S. Gordon, M.D., the Clinton Administration's appointee as chairman of the [White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP)](https://www.whccamp.hhs.gov/), has written about his experiences as a student of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. His book The Golden Guru: The Strange Jouney of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Stephen Greene Press, Lexington, Mass, 1988) purports to be a psychological analysis of his teacher's descent into authoritarianism. The book presents Gordon's theories about authoritarianism, but it also attributes \"wisdom and generosity\" to behavior that most people would regard as purely malignant. Gordon's \"Rebirth\" In 1979, Gordon traveled to Poona, India, at his own expense after his request for a National Institute of Mental Health grant to study Rajneesh's commune had been quashed by the State Department, which considered the organization to be a dangerous cult similar to Jim Jones' People's Temple. In Chapter 3 (\"Surrender to Bhagwan\"), Gordon describes the \"rebirthing\" experience he underwent during his one-month stay: Several days before I leave Poona . have . I am. . . particularly anxious to see what the combination of Rajneesh and rebirthing will be like. Rebirthers follow the theory of the psychoanalyst Otto Rank and the practice of Leonard Orr. They believe that only by reexperiencing the primal trauma of birth . . . can one undo the harm, the emotional and physical constriction, the fear and rage, that result from the abrupt transition from intrauterine peace to the cold, noisy, bright lights of the delivery room and the larger world. The technique is, I discover, remarkably simple. I am instructed to lie naked on a mat (sometimes rebirthing is done in water) and breathe deeply, in and out, through my mouth. In Poona, to my surprise, my rebirther, a beautiful, rather distant Danish blonde, takes off her clothes as well. She sits behind me, naked except for her mala [necklace with picture of Rajneesh], on a mattress. . . . My breathing begins to feel hoarse and raspy and my body begins to rock and flail. I know I am hyperventilating. The oxygen is accumulating and the carbon dioxide in my blood is decreasing . . . The woman touches me from time to time. . . . I am aware of some sort of raw force not exactly in her, but coming through her. It feels. . . like Rajneesh. . . . Now it is as if she is hardly there, a hollow reed, an instrument that Rajneesh is playing. My head feels terrible, constricted as if it is being crushed in a vice. I can barely breathe. I panic for a moment, feeling like I am going to suffocate, remembering the fear that haunted the moments before childhood sleep. My God, am I imagining this? Or is this really some bodily memory, a replay of my descent through the birth canal. There is agony in my right shoulder. It is being crushed toward my chest, tearing at my upper back in the place where tension always produces pain. I am terrified. Air is rushing in as if my mouth were a vacuum. I'm, shrieking now, an unearthly sound I have never consciously made before, drying, screaming. I am flailing on the mat, squalling like a newborn, feeling my mouth open, hearing the sound and marveling, as if at the first glimpse of an ancient relic. Gordon goes on like this for another page, then concludes: Nature is unfolding in me with enormous power and confidence. . . . I gather myself . . . there is no pain in the knees that have bothered me for years. . . . Even my aching lower back is straighter than any osteopath has ever made it. My eyes, when I look at them in a mirror, are as clear as a baby's. I look up now, away from my own face to Rajneesh's. He is looking down at me, smiling, impish, knowing. . . . I feel that he has made this experience possible, kicked my energy like some sluggish electron into a more excited, active, higher state. I feel gratitude and love, not so general now as in groups, but focused on Rajneesh, on his generosity. I feel clean, blissful, and \u2014 yes, I have to admit it \u2014 reborn. That's why they call it rebirthing, I giggle to myself. Defense of Violent Psychotherapy In Chapter 3, Gordon also responds to the charges that people are being sorely injured and even killed though violent encounter therapies at Poona,. Gordon defends violence as long as it is not \"self-indulgent\" or fatal: The violence had ended by the time I had gotten to Poona . . . but it still bothered me. It wasn't that I was against fighting in groups. I knew from years of psychiatric work and my own two years' experience in an encounter group that the potential for destructiveness was present in all of us, that some kind of controlled release coupled with awareness could be therapeutic \u2014 indeed, had been therapeutic for me. . . . Most [of the people at Poona] believed that the violent confrontations - - even their own bad bruises and broken limbs \u2014 had been a small and necessary price to pay for the freedom they now felt from past traumas and inhibitions, for the perspective they had gained on their own sadism and masochism. I could also see that violence in a few groups might in some way have helped to exorcise the community's latent collective violence. I knew too that spiritual teachers \u2014 Marpa with his disciple Milarepa, Gurdjieff, and many Zen masters \u2014 had sometimes used violence as a device to break down disciples' arrogance and resistance to change, to get them to see reality, including themselves, as they were. In this context, incitement to violence or acts of violence were just another aspect of what the Tibetan Buddhists called ati yana, the crazy wisdom of spontaneous and inexplicable but appropriate action. . . . Still I had my doubts about the value of violence in the groups. It was true that even with the hospitalizations and the two suicides, far fewer people were adversely affected than I would have expected with such powerful techniques used on so many thousands of unscreened participants. . . . In my own experience in America, violence had been controlled and contained, whereas in Poona it had . . . often become self-indulgent. Defense of Rajneesh's Wealth In Chapter 5 (\"The Rolls Royce Guru\"), Gordon excuses Rajneesh's ostentatious displays of wealth \u2014 which included 93 Rolls Royce cars \u2014 by classifying them as an \"obsessive symptom\" and later concluding that the possession of the cars was insignificant. In India, Rajneesh had been known as the sex guru, in America he was becoming known as the Rolls-Royce guru. He had always liked good and expensive cars and certainly he must have enjoyed even more the notoriety and confusion, the anger and envy, that his possession of so many \u2014 so absurdly, unnecessarily, outrageously many \u2014 of them aroused. Just as he enjoyed provoking the Gandhiites and ascetics in India, so he loved sticking it to America's puritans. In displaying his wealth so conspicuously, in ignoring accusations of selfishness, Rajneesh was mocking the preconceptions of his New World audience, who \u2014 particularly the Christians \u2014 who tended to associate spirituality with poverty, modesty, charity. He was telling them they were deluded, that wealth was \"immensely spiritual,\" a precondition for spirituality. Poverty was worse than useless, and voluntary poverty an inverted form of pride. He would, some time later, declare himself \"the rich man's guru\" and condemn charity as a tool for enslaving the poor and a salve for the guilty consciences of the rich. It seemed to me that at the same time Rajneesh was, a bit more subtly, putting us on. His display of wealth was a lampoon of the far greater wealth and power of the Pope and man of America's TV evangelists. They acted humble, if not poor, kissing the earth and praising the impoverished, emphasizing their own humble beginnings. In so doing, he seemed to be saying, they showed themselves to be hypocrites. Rajneesh was, he would have us believe, at least honest. He praised the wealth he enjoyed, condemned the poverty he avoided. A popular ranch bumper sticker read: \"Jesus Saves. Moses Invests. Bhagwan Spends.\" I found that my reactions to the cars were always changing..Initially I was repulsed. . . . Later in an analytic frame of mind, I classified Rajneesh's collecting as a symptom that had existed since childhood. I remember reading that when he was a boy his mother had sewn extra pockets in his pants so that he could collect more stones from a nearby beach . . . . later he collected books, then fountain pens, then hats and towels, then watches...and now finally, cars. Always the best and most expensive. It was, I concluded, a fixation.. The prepubescent boy's obsessive collecting \u2014 a kind of sublimated, anxiety-ridden greed \u2014 was preserved in the middle-aged man . . perhaps when he was satiated . . . the watches and cars would lose their meaning, too. . . . One morning I awakened and imagined a beneficent Bhagwan accumulating Rolls-Royces to show people that infinite wealth was available. All we had to do was live like the lilies in the field, trust existence in each moment, and everything would be given. The Rolls-Royces were simply symbols that those of us too stupid to get the message of the Sermon on the Mount might understand. Another time I focused on Rajneesh's ethnicity. How many Indian men had I seen who lavished more attention on their Rolex than on their wife? Rolls-Royces? Every maharaja worth the name had owned at least one. The motor car that was the pride of the colonizing British was the ultimate status symbol for the colonized. Tajneesh was simply one-upping all of them. Then, on another occasion, it hit me that the Rolls-Royces didn't mean anything at all. All the meanings that we were attributing to them were only reflections of our psyches. The cars were what Indians call a leela, a play. Their showy presence was merely a clever reminder that the whole of existence is just a play. Defense of Rajneesh's Unethical Recruiting Activity In the Fall of 1984, the Rajneeshees recruited hundreds of mentally ill and drug-addict street people to come to Oregon to vote as part of their plan to take over their section of rural Oregon through the ballot box. (Rajneeshees also inoculated salad bars with salmonella bacteria to keep local residents away from the polls.) Recruits were bussed to Oregon and subjected to Rajneeshee discipline. Some were drugged with Haldol. The Oregon Psychiatric Association and Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield spoke out strongly against the Rajneeshees, saying that they were manipulating these vulnerable people and often holding them against their will. Gordon was involved as a NIMH researcher, he claims \u2014 in Rajneesh's recruiting efforts in Washington, D.C.! In Chapter 7 (\"The Share-A-Home Campaign\"), he defends them: Psychiatry's record for dealing with the desperately needy and the homeless has been dismal. I can understand questioning the program [by the Oregon Psychiatric Assn] and especially wanting to learn from it, but accusations made without evidence have a hollow ring. The program, in spite of its inequities and exploitativeness, does seem a great improvement over what these men have been offered in city and state mental hospitals and shelters. Those who stay are functioning, useful members of a loving community. They seem to have a real opportunity to change. Lessons Learned from Rajneesh In the book's Epilogue, Gordon sums up what he has learned from his nearly 13 years as a student of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Nevertheless, during the last twenty years, the wisdom and generosity of the ideal Rajneesh offered have helped his sannyasins and me and many more people to see the generous, spontaneous, celebratory aspects of ourselves. His vision of a loving, cooperative community dedicated to the creation of new men and women living in harmony with their own nature and the natural world have provoked and inspired us. Similarly, his self-absorption, and self-deception, his destructive, controlling actions and his sannyasins' collaboration in them, can help show us our own willingness to be self-absorbed and destructive, to be controlled individually and in groups, and to deceive ourselves. The contradictions in Rajneesh and in his sannyasins remind us that the ideals to which we aspire and the flaws which we fear are both already present in us. For me, it is not finally a question of agreeing or disagreeing with Rajneesh, of praising or condemning him or his sannyasins. It is, rather, a matter of learning from him and them, of appreciating his remarkable talents and gifts and recognizing his perverse uses of them, of seeing myself in him and his sannyasins, of using his extraordinary story and strange, as yet unfinished journey as a mirror for my own.

[Hide Full Content](#fourteen-thousand-thirty-nine) [A Lifelong Victim of Quacks](https://quackwatch.org/related/victims/fowden/) My mother was a lifelong believer in natural cures. Although we had a family doctor, she was suspicious of doctors all her life. Much of that suspicion was the result of claims by the quacks she consulted with. They always warned of \"conspiracy by the medical community to suppress their revolutionary treatments\". Also, she was consistently told that \"traditional medicine\" treatments would prevent the \"natural\" cures from working, so it was never recommended that one try the natural cures as a mere \"supplement\" to a doctor's care. Also, natural methods were intertwined with religious beliefs. My mother's family was closely associated with a little known religion whose founder was a chiropractor.

Although we had a family doctor, she was suspicious of doctors all her life. Much of that suspicion was the result of claims by the quacks she consulted with. They always warned of \"conspiracy by the medical community to suppress their revolutionary treatments\". Also, she was consistently told that \"traditional medicine\" treatments would prevent the \"natural\" cures from working, so it was never recommended that one try the natural cures as a mere \"supplement\" to a doctor's care. Also, natural methods were intertwined with religious beliefs. My mother's family was closely associated with a little known religion whose founder was a chiropractor. They were taught that nature (God) provided answers to every ill, and that doctors, medicine, manufactured supplements, chemicals of any kind, etc. are created by people who do not have the proper faith. They are trying to \"play God\" or replace God or even defy God by leading people astray. As children, we were given regular doses of cod liver oil, vitamin C (rose hips are the only reliable type), and other supplements. Earaches were treated with garlic, colds with extra vitamin C dissolved in Jello water, sore throats with cayenne pepper wraps, and headaches with vitamin A. If one complained of any symptoms in my grandmother's presence, she would ask, \"When did you last have an enema?\" I was in my late teenage years before I ever had an aspirin. I was staying with a friend and had a headache. Her mother offered me an aspirin, which I guiltily accepted. I was amazed at how quickly and effectively it worked! From then on, I began to question whether the \"natural\" methods were all that great. We were taken to the doctor only for such things as stitches, wart removal (when the wart did not respond to rubbing with a burnt broom straw), and illnesses that stubbornly refused to respond to the natural treatment. Even then, the written prescriptions were nearly always discarded rather than taken to a pharmacy to be filled. I have a vague recollection of the whole family being taken to receive polio vaccine on a sugar cube, but my brothers and sisters and I did not ever receive other vaccines. For school registrations or summer camp applications, my mother would fill in the sections verifying the required immunizations with bogus dates and then sign the form with \"Dr. G. Card\" (her maiden name). Antibiotics (which translates to \"against life\") were considered one of the worst inventions of modern medicine. And glucose given in IV's were proof that doctors have no understanding of real nutrition. Sugar is \"white death\" and to deliberately pump it into the veins shows ignorance at best and evil at worst. Though my mother gave birth to all 7 children in the hospital, in her later years she did not even trust doctors and hospitals for that purpose. She tried once to convince my sister to have her baby at home using a mid-wife. At the age of 49, my father, who had never been sick a day in his life, experienced sudden numbness on his entire left side. He was taken to the doctor and a CT scan was done. Unfortunately, the exam showed him to have a rather large brain tumor. My mother reluctantly agreed to allow a biopsy, which proved the tumor to be malignant and inoperable. The doctors advised immediate treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. To our dismay, my parents decided not to heed that advice. My mother was advised by family members and other associates of a natural cancer treatment that promised \"miraculous results\". Of course, as is typical, she was advised that the chemotherapy would destroy the healing powers of the natural cure, so they had to choose one or the other. My father was treated at home with a diet mostly consisting of raw fruits (fresh pineapple in particular), and daily coffee enemas. His condition rapidly deteriorated and he died 3 weeks from the date of his first symptom. Our old family doctor came to our home and signed the death certificate. He consoled the family by saying that the tumor must have been so far advanced that the chemotherapy would not have been able to help. My father's death was a huge blow to those family members who expected the miraculous cure. But in the weeks and months following his death, my mother found \"research\" that implied that the very act of taking the biopsy \"exposed the tumor to open air\" which spurred the tumor to unnaturally fast growth. From then on, my mother always said she should never have allowed the biopsy to be done. It was the sole cause of the tumor's rapid growth and the thing that kept the coffee enemas from being able to work properly. My mother battled weight all her life. At one point, she was under the care of some \"alternative care doctor\" who put her on a diet. First she eliminated all sugars and refined flours from her diet (she had been a vegetarian for many years already). After a few weeks, she eliminated all carbohydrates. Each step eliminated another food, until all she was eating was raw vegetables (and only certain vegetables at that). She became weak. She had \"brown outs\" when she stood suddenly. Her eyes and skin began to take on a yellow shade. The practioner she was seeing became concerned and did something very rare for most quacks. He actually told her that she needed to stop the diet and seek care from an internist. However, my mother had experienced weight loss on this diet and didn't feel that a medical doctor would understand her concerns, so she simply changed one quack for another. Incidentally, she didn't have any trouble finding one who didn't recommend care by an internist. The new practioner however, was not able to reverse the damage that had already been done. After several weeks under his care, her skin was bright yellow and her eyes looked like some Hollywood special effect. At that point, he felt she needed care from a \"real expert\" and referred her to another local clinic run by a naturopath. My mother was pleased to be referred because she had read several books written by this \"doctor.\" I was very concerned for my mother's health at this point and completely skeptical of this quack, and as she was too weak to even drive herself to the clinic, I offered to accompany her. This clinic was actually a single exam room at the back of a health food store. There were shelves of vitamins and supplements and a juice counter. There was a rack of books written by the naturopath, which someone had gone through with a black marker to blot out the \"N.D.\" after his name. (Our state had recently passed legislation outlawing the use of credentials that were not the result of actual degrees by accredited institutions.) My mother was given a form to complete before her consultation. The top of the form had a statement for the patient to sign which said, \"I certify that I am not an investigator or informant for any news, government or medical bureau and that information obtained from this consultation will not be used for prosecution of this clinic, its owners or employees.\" The bottom of the form had another disclaimer which read, \"I understand that [the doctor] is not a medical doctor and that anything said during the course of my visit is conversation only and cannot be construed as medical advice.\" My mother read and signed the form without hesitation. I asked if those disclaimers (especially the first one) didn't make her a little nervous. She explained that naturopaths were forced to protect themselves because of unfair persecution and prosecution by the medical establishment who are threatened by their knowledge. Because she understood the need for him to protect himself legally, she had no problems about signing the statements. After we were taken into the exam room, the \"doctor\" came in and instructed Mother to lie face down on the table. He began by massaging her feet gently occasionally asking if this spot or that felt tender. I watched then as he dug both thumbnails deeply into the balls of her feet and asked, \"Is this uncomfortable?\" When she affirmed that it was, he said, \"That indicates the problem would be with your liver.\" I was astonished! The pressure he applied would have been uncomfortable no matter what spot it was on, and the bright color of her skin and eyes made liver problems obvious to anybody, with or without a degree! He then prescribed a long list of supplements and tinctures, which could be conveniently purchased right there in his store. He also told her that she was to drink green juice for every meal. Green juice is a concoction invented by the naturopath himself and made right there in his juice bar. Basically, it consists of cucumbers, parsley, kale, cabbage and any other green vegetable. The exact mixture is known only to himself and has to be made fresh daily, so that it is necessary to return to his store frequently. As we left the clinic, I asked my mother if she would please come with me to the hospital and have blood drawn for a liver function test. I work for a doctor and I knew she would willingly give the order. She asked what a liver function test would tell. I said that the levels of various things found in the blood would tell the extent and the type of liver dysfunction we were dealing with. She smiled and said she didn't think it was necessary to do that. She felt that her liver had been \"overloaded with toxins\" most of her life, and that her recent diet changes had caused the liver to \"dump\" these toxins into her blood. Her only problem was that the liver was cleansing too fast. She was sure that a liver function test would show lots of high levels of toxins in her blood, but this didn't mean the liver was not functioning. It meant the liver was functioning a little too well at the moment. And she trusted what she had been told. After all, the naturopath's own son had once been diagnosed with liver cancer. When traditional medicine gave up on him, the naturopath invented green juice, which saved his son's life. (Or so he said.) Besides, a hospital would just want to give her antibiotics and IVs. She was just finally cleansing her liver and wasn't about to let them put glucose in her. I tried to tell her that labs don't provided treatment and that she always had the right to say no if anyone did recommend treatment. \"No,\" she said, \"I don't have insurance so I wouldn't have any way of paying for lab tests. Incidently, she had just spent approximately $75 for the consultation and treatment recommendations. For the next couple of weeks, her conditioned actually worsened. She vomited soon after taking any nourishment and was unable to get out of bed for many days. But she faithfully followed all of the recommendations, enduring green juice, a complicated regimen of supplements, and an occasional enema. Gradually, she improved, and many weeks af ter beginning the treatment, she got better. She maintained that the naturopath had saved her life. I always felt that she got better in spite of his care, not because of it. Several years later, my mother became ill again. This time, she experienced some respiratory problems, lack of energy and some vomiting. She had been spreading some wood chips the day before and felt like she had inhaled some dust or something. Over the next year-and-a-half, she continued to have problems. The respiratory troubles lessened some, but she continued with dizziness, lack of energy and vomiting. She consulted a number of naturopathic \"healers\". Each time she found a new one, she felt confident that they knew the answer to her problems. She would experience a period of improvement, only to relapse a short time later. She was told that there must have been sycamore in the wood chips that she had worked in, and that sycamore is very dangerous, causing severe respiratory symptoms. She lost a lot of weight in the process, but her appearance was terrible. After several months and a lot of nagging, we were thrilled when she told us she had finally broken down and scheduled an appointment with a doctor. Unfortunately, it turned out that the doctor was a chiropractor. Her symptoms eased for a time, then came back worse. By this time, she was not only vomiting daily, she was spitting up a lot of mucus. She kept a cup or tissues nearby all the time and feared leaving the house because of the constant spitting up of mucus. A referral from a health store employee led her to a consultation with a new clinic. This practioner placed magnets all over her body and informed her that her kidneys appeared to be her weakest area. She went weekly for some type of \"electro-magnetic\" therapy. Again, she improved for a time, then got much worse. During this time, in addition to treatments from various practioners, she was going to a clinic weekly (sometimes 2-3 times weekly) for \"high colonics\", at approximately $20 per session. She was not having regular bowel movements at home, so when a few days went by without one, she would go for another of these \"power enemas\". About 15 months into her illness, she heard of a clinic in Reno that was run by a medical doctor who used on;y \"natural\" treatments. However, as she was making preparations to travel there, her sister heard a radio interview about a clinic in Las Vegas. The radio show was peppered with anecdotes about people who were miraculously healed after the medical community had given up on them. At the last minute, she changed her travel plans and went to Las Vegas instead. This \"healer\" worked by moving his hands over the body (never actually coming into contact) and going into some type of trance. Normally, treatments are scheduled in advance and several days or weeks apart, but he was willing to make an exception and fit my mother in to be able to be treated every day until she was healed. After the 2nd or 3rd treatment, she suddenly felt a \"breakthough\". She said she felt something \"like a flood gate opening\", and immediately felt better. He told her she would need just a few more treatments to be healed completely. However, during one of the next treatments, the healer began talking to her and trying to explain his healing powers. He kept emphasizing that it was not based in any religious faith. Something about that upset or frightened her and she could not go back. She packed her bags and returned to Salt Lake. At that point, she was too weak to endure a car ride home, so she flew. She required wheelchair assistance to even get off the plane. Once again, she told us that she was now ready to seek care \"from a real doctor\". However, again she would not see an M.D. The doctor she planned to see was a D.O. I asked around at work and was reassured that D.O.s are not necessarily quacks, but they are medically trained doctors who just try to use more natural treatments wherever possible. I decided to attend the first appointment with my mother. In the waiting room, a lady chatted with me about how the doctor had saved her life. I was hopeful. During the appointment, he listened to her describe the illness. His exam was more like a doctor's exam, listening to her heart and respirations, checking pulses and reflexes and palpating her abdomen. He ordered blood work and x-rays, and advised her to eat a wider variety of foods, including even chicken and fish (she had been a vegetarian for many years). He scheduled a follow-up appointment to review the lab and x-ray findings. I was so relieved. Then he recommended that she carefully track everything she ate, and the pattern of symptoms in relation to eating and other activities. To aid her in this task, he recommended she purchase a computer program. Many software programs could be used. However, he just happened to have one on hand, for the low, low price of $75.00. She readily agreed to purchase it. On our way out, we passed a large room. It was wall-to-wall recliners filled with patients receiving some bright yellow liquid by IV. The sign said \"Chelation Therapy,\" and there was the little old lady I had chatted with in the waiting room. I had never heard of chelation, but immediately worried about the legitimacy of this new doctor. When I returned to work, I asked the doctors I work for what chelation is. They both shrugged their shoulders. The next day was Thanksgiving and my mother felt well enough to sit at the table. She even ate turkey, the first meat she'd had in over 20 years. But by that evening, she was vomiting and again felt very weak. Two days later, each time she sat up or tried to get out of bed, she would pass out. When she told my sister she felt it was time to give up and allow herself to die, I felt I had to take immediate action. After some pretty strong words from me, with my sister nodding in agreement, we finally got her to agree to go to the hospital. By the time my mother finally went to the hospital, she had been ill for one-and-a-half years, and had lost more than 150 lbs. On arrival in the ER, her blood pressure was low enough to scare everyone involved. She also vomited what looked like bile and blood. She was admitted to the hospital. She required IV rehydration, 7 units of blood, and cardiac monitoring. The following day, an endoscopy was done which showed a very large ulcer completely obstructing her pylorus. The doctor could not even pass the slender tube of the scope through that area. She was found to be positive for helicobacter pylori infection. After a 5-day hospital stay, she was able to get up and walk, had much better energy and coloring, and was eating without vomiting. She had gained 12 lbs. since her admission, all due to the rehydration. She said she felt foolish that she had suffered so much for so long over something as simple and common as an ulcer, and even said she wished she'd gone to a doctor much sooner. She agreed to take the prescribed medications and return in a month for follow-up endoscopy. Her only complaint was a small bedsore at the base of her spine. Before we returned for the follow-up endoscopy, she returned to the osteopath's office. He gave her an herbal supplement to take along with the prescription drugs. He told her he thought the doctor would be amazed at how low her helicobacter pylori level would be after taking this supplement. However, on follow-up endoscopy, the ulcer did not appear much smaller at all after 30 days of treatment. The endoscopy doctor recommended doubling the dose of Prevacid she was taking. She was very disappointed with the findings. Even though she looked and felt better than she had in years, she felt like she must not be making any progress. When she reported the finding to the osteopath, he recommended stopping the Prevacid completely and doubling the herbal supplement instead, which advice my mother followed. Her health deteriorated rapidly from that point. The bedsore she had developed continued to bother her. She also broke out in a rash. Although the rash appeared in several areas of the arms and legs, the fact that it also occurred near her IV site make her fear she had picked up an infection while she was in the hospital. She left to stay with her sister so she could have help making her vegetable juices that were the mainstay of her diet. One afternoon, my aunt called me to say she was very concerned about my mother. I stated that she needed to go back to the doctor if she was having trouble again. My aunt said, \"she won't even think of that. They gave her this infection.\" Skeptical and tired of their \"playing doctor\", I drove over to see what was going on with my mother. When I arrived, I found my mother too weak to even sit up in bed. Her arms and face were covered with large red patches, which seemed to be growing right before our eyes. Her blood pressure was too low to register on my aunt's home-use monitor. Even worse, my aunt rolled her to her side and pulled back the covers to show me the bedsore. It was nearly 3 inches in diameter and the surrounding tissue was black. There was a horrible, decaying smell coming from it. Once again, we picked her up (she was as light and limp as a rag doll) and took her to the hospital. As soon as they saw the red splotches, the ER personnel moved to isolate my mother in case it was infectious. They admitted her almost immediately to the ICU. The doctors were at a loss to know what to do for her first. They had to establish that the bedsore had not perforated her bowel. They moved her into the Burn Unit, hoping that the air-pillow beds there would alleviate the discomfort of the bedsore and the patches all over her body. They cut away the dead tissue around the bedsore, only to see it immediately begin necrotizing again. A repeat endoscopy showed that she now had multiple ulcers throughout her GI tract. The fluid they drained from her lungs was tinged with blood. Almost every system of her body was affected. She was placed on IV fluids and IV antibiotics, and eventually, steroids. She had an oxygen mask, but on her 2nd day in the hospital, she experienced respiratory arrest, so the decision was made to place her on a ventilator. She was very weak, but was completely compliant with all the doctors' recommendations. By the 2nd day, all but one of my siblings had arrived in town and the doctor in charge brought us all together to explain the situation. Her condition was being attributed to Henoch-Schonlein purpura, although his studies only showed a handful of cases which presented in an adult this severely. All the previous such cases had been fatal, but the most recent had been back in the 1940's, when there were not any of today's medical treatments available. He had consulted with many experts around the country and they agreed the best course was to treat with high doses of steroids. He certainly couldn't make any promises and said that if it was going to work, we should see some improvement over the next 24-48 hours. We were all in agreement with the doctor's recommendations. Unfortunately, after a couple of hours on the ventilator, my mother asked us to stop the treatments and remove to tube. We were all distressed, because we wanted to wait the 24-48 hours to see if the treatments would work, but none of us were able to convince her to wait it out. A psychiatric consult was done so the hospital staff could be assured that she understood what she was asking for and the probable consequences of stopping the treatment. As her children, we wanted to continue the treatment, but respected her right to decide for herself. After about 12 hours on the ventilator, the tube was removed. She almost immediately requested the IVs be removed and she be allowed to go home. Again, we were frustrated by her choices, but decided to honor her wishes. She was taken home and died about 24 hours later. Because of the premature termination of her treatment and further studies, we will never really know what caused her illness, and ultimately, her death. After a life of \"brainwashing\" by multiple \"natural healers\", she was completely fearful of all the treatments she was receiving. Antibiotics, glucose and other IV fluids, blood transfusions, steroids, \"artificial\" life support, high costs, and doctors making the decisions for her care were all things she was taught to fear most, and in the end, these were all that could be offered to try and save her. I believe that the long illness prior to her final hospitalization left her body and her immune system too weak to fight and that her years of trust in various quacks left her fearful and even paranoid of the medical care that could have saved her. I am often angry that she was taken from us prematurely and I lay blame for that on the practioners she trusted. In all her experience, only one had the integrity to admit he couldn't help her and advise her to seek medical care. My mother was driven by a desire to do what was right, and these quacks turn medical care into a moral issue. She was afraid of the doctors and their motives, and afraid that trusting them showed moral weakness. I think the driving force for these most of these quacks is money. They use fear and deception, and other \"mind games\" to maintain their hold on people. I am angry and frustrated at what they did to my mother and my family, but more frustrated to know that they are all still out there practicing and deceiving other people. _____________________ Ms. Fowden, who resides in Sandy, Utah, hopes that posting her story will help others by showing how practitioners may keep on quacking even when their patient is dying from lack of appropriate care.

The Washington State Court of Appeals has upheld an administrative decision to discipline former chiropractor John D. Brown for unprofessional conduct for practicing with an expired license. In 2000, the Commission of Chiropractic Quality Assurance charged that Brown had performed chiropractic manipulations but called his practice \"alphabiotics.\" which he claimed is a sacrament of the Alphabiotic Church, of which he said he is a priest. He testified that he was performing alphabiotic \"alignment\" and not a chiropractic adjustment. However, the Commission concluded that \"alphabiotics\" treatments are indistinguishable from chiropractic and that certain techniques he used are associated with risk of stroke. It also concluded that his failure to warn of the risk of stroke \u2014 and an inadequate response when one of his patients suffered a stroke during an adjustment \u2014 were below the state standard of care required for chiropractors. The Commission levied a $30,000 fine and revoked Brown's license for ten years. Alphabiotics is said to have been started in the 1920s by Virgil B. Chrane, D.C., and \"established as a unique new profession\" in 1971 by his son Virgil Chrane, Jr., D.C., whose son Michael practices in Dallas, Texas. The [Alphabiotics International](http://www.alphabiotics.com/) Web site defines alphabiotics as \"a truth and love based metaphysical belief system that concerns itself with the interrelationship between the lesser self, the better self, and Life; i.e. the Omniscient, Omnipresent, Omnipotent Supreme Consciousness.\" In February 2002, the site listed about 75 \"alphabioticists\" who have been \"granted certification by the International Alphabiotic Association.\" A [disclaimer](http://www.align.addr.com/disclaimer.htm) on the site stated (in part): An alphabioticist's commitment is above and beyond crass commercialism and secular therapeutics. It's a calling and a search for truth. They do not presume to tell anyone what to believe, think or do. They are not into control, but enlightenment. Neither do they attempt to diagnose, heal, treat or cure anyone of anything. Rather, alphabioticists instruct, enable, and empower others to deal with stress and be more awake and aware - in order that they might resolve their own challenges and make their lives work better. Alphabioticists do not presume to dispense medical advice or prescribe the use of any procedure, process or technique as a form of treatment for any medical injury, illness or disease, either directly or indirectly. Their sincere intent is to offer help and information of a vital nature, to enable others to take greater self-responsibility. In the event someone uses Alphabiotic information as if it were therapeutic-medical-advice, they would be prescribing for themselves, which is their God-given right, but Alphabioticists, Alphabiotics, the Alphabiotic Academy, Alphabiotics International, and the International Alphabiotic Association assume no responsibility for such actions. . . . Medical therapeutics and Alphabiotics are based on completely different principles; so different that each of the two systems are almost incomprehensible to the believers in the other's concepts. Ordinary medical therapeutics is based in physical biology, which is in turn based in an atheistic philosophy called materialism. Materialism holds that only material things, those things that can be weighed and measured are real. In practice, it brooks no recognition of a spiritual, non-physical dimension. Alphabiotics admits to another reality. It recognizes a Spiritual Presence in human beings; an Intelligent, inner Life Force, which is not physically measurable. Alphabioticists see this inner Presence as being infinitely wise and purposeful and recognize that it is an expression of a greater Unified-Field, called God. Alphabiotics is grounded in quantum mechanics, relativity physics, and a spiritual theology. Alphabioticists see physical disease as a result of wrong choices and a mis-direction of normal Life energy flow. A chiropractic adjustment involves a very specific procedure done to correct an improper relationship between spinal vertebrae. Chiropractic adjustments are only done after a very precise spinal analysis, properly done by a competent and qualified chiropractor, who has had years of intense training. There are many variables that must be taken into account for a chiropractic adjustment to be administered correctly. . . . The Alphabiotic Process, though accomplished by hand, is totally different from a chiropractic adjustment. The Alphabioticists hand placements are on the head, not on the neck. It is not a manipulation or adjustment procedure designed to reposition spinal vertebrae. Vertebral adjusting, to an Alphabioticist, is a violent invasion of the body's natural defense mechanisms. To compare a chiropractic adjustment to the Alphabiotic Process is ridiculous. It is never given to heal any disease or medical condition. The intent, purpose, and reason for the Alphabiotic process is as different from a chiropractic adjustment, or a medical manipulation, as night and day, in and out, black and white, up and down, good and bad. The reason we even mention the difference between chiropractic and Alphabiotics is because Alphabioticists have been legally attacked by chiropractors over 20 times in the last 30 years. We believe ignorance is the reason. Please Note: Alphabiotics has been victorious each time. Know also, that Alphabiotics is a \"legally protected\" word. And, only one group, the Alphabiotic Academy, is authorized to teach Alphabiotics and only one group, Alphabiotics International, is legally authorized to certify Alphabioticists. Certified Alphabioticists are listed only in the Directory on this official Alphabiotic Web Site. If anyone says he or she is qualified as an Alphabioticist, check to see if that person is listed in our Directory, and ask to see an official, up-to-date Continuing Education Certificate (these are issued annually, to qualified Alphabioticists, only by Alphabiotics International). Chiropractic scam artists, who could not do the Alphabiotic Process properly if their lives depended on it, are around who teach a bastardized, extremely dangerous, and totally wrong version of the Alphabiotic Process. They present it as a therapy designed to get sick people well. They are con-men, and their motive is to deceive and rob people. We know of no one who has mastered the Alphabiotic Process in less than 2 to 5 years of very intense, focused effort and training. Beyond that, a spiritual intent is the critical factor in properly administering the Process. Con-men do not have that kind of intent. . . . An affidavit from Virgil Benson Chrane included on the disclaimer page states (in part): Alphabiotic ministers do not claim to be diagnosticians, healers or therapists. They do not render treatments for injuries or diseases. Theirs is a greater concern and a higher calling than therapeutics. . . . The major difference between chiropractic and Alphabiotics, in my considered opinion, is the difference that exists between atheism and theism. Alphabiotic ministers do not want to be chiropractors or any other kind of therapist; they have little confidence in secular treatment systems, which by-and-large are atheistic practices that deny the existence of God. Beyond that, Alphabiotic ministers are sworn by sacred oath not to practice Alphabiotics as if it were a therapy. They have pledged their sacred honor in this regard. [Alphabiotics.com](http://www.alphabiotics.com/) states that alphabiotics \"can't be fully explained\" but \"must be experienced to be fully understood.\" However, the Washington Commission of Chiropractic Quality Assurance concluded that it is a chiropractic variant in which treatment is limited to neck adjustment. Here's the full text of the appeals court decision: IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON | | JOHN D. BROWN, D.C., Appellant, v. STATE OF WASHINGTON, Respondent FILED: - Appeal from Superior Court of King County - Docket No: 002103310 - Judgment or order under review - Date filed: 12/12/2000 - Judge signing: Hon. Sharon Armstrong PER CURIAM John Brown appeals the trial court's decision affirming the Commission of Chiropractic Quality Assurance's (Commission) final order. The order revoked his license to practice as a chiropractor, imposed a $30,000 fine, ordered him to cease and desist from all actions falling within the chiropractic practice, and prohibited him from representing himself as a licensed chiropractor. Brown contends that (1) the Commission did not have jurisdiction over him because his license had expired, (2) the findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence, and (3) the freedom to practice his religion prevents the State from regulating his practice. We affirm the Commission's order because it had jurisdiction to hear this matter, the administrative record contained substantial evidence, including the Commissioners' expertise, to support its findings, and the State has authority to regulate Brown's practices to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. FACTS In January 1966, John Brown got his chiropractic license from the State of Washington. His license expired on July 3, 1993, and Brown has not renewed it. In February 1997, Patient A was suffering from headaches, and on the recommendation of her sister, Alison Falco, she went to the Alphabiotic New Life Center which Brown operates. Patient A testified that Brown told her he had been a chiropractor for 20 years, but did not tell her that his license was expired. She also testified that she would not have sought his treatment if she had known he was unlicensed, that he referred to himself as 'doctor,' and that he had business cards that read 'Dr. John D. Brown, Developmental Alphabioticist.' Brown told her that the difference between chiropractic and alphabiotics was that only neck alignments were performed in alphabiotics. On February 10, 1997, Patient A went to Brown for treatment of her headaches, and she filled out and signed a form containing biographical information. She testified that she did not read all of it. She also admitted signing a form entitled 'Comprehension,' but said that she did not read it thoroughly. She stated that Brown handed her the forms without explaining their content, that she did not believe she was joining a religious organization, and that she would not have joined if she had known she was being asked to. During treatment, Brown had Patient A lie on an inclined table while he placed his hands under her neck and turned her head from side to side. Brown placed one hand on her chin and one hand under her neck, turned her head to one side, and then forcefully pulled her head up to the table. He repeated this procedure after turning her head to the other side. Patient A testified that it was very similar to prior chiropractic treatment she received in New York. Patient A testified that after paying Brown $20 for the treatment, she felt fine and her headaches and neck stiffness decreased. Brown did not warn her of the risk of stroke from the procedure he performed. She also stated that she did not believe she was making a donation, and there were no religious discussions, prayers, readings, or materials associated with her visit. Patient A returned to Brown's facility four more times. He performed the same procedure each time, she paid $20 per visit, and there were no religious discussions. Following her fifth visit, Patient A suffered minor dizziness and neck pain. When she told Brown about it, he recommended she return for another treatment. When she returned for her final treatment on March 12, 1997, Brown performed the same procedure. But this time, when he turned Patient A's head to the right and pulled her head up, she experienced immediate vertigo and nausea. She told Brown, and he told her to rest for a minute. Brown left the room, and when he returned, she was still suffering vertigo and nausea. Brown had to help her sit up because she was unable to do so alone. She vomited, sweated profusely, and could not feel her feet or left leg. She asked Brown to call Falco. He did so, but did not tell her it was urgent. When Falco arrived, she and another woman helped Patient A into the restroom where she lost control of her bowels and continued to vomit. Brown knocked on the bathroom door and said, 'You really need to get her home.' He did not mention that she could have had a stroke, did not call 911, and did not advise Falco to take her to the emergency room. Falco and Robert Freeman, Patient A's brother-in-law, took her home and, after consulting a physician, took her to the emergency room. Patient A was diagnosed with a stroke caused by dissections of both vertebral arteries which her physicians believe Brown's procedure caused. She was hospitalized for eleven days, did not work for a month, could only work part-time for two months, has had to reduce the intensity of her job, and has lost income. Patient A brought a civil action against Brown. Falco and Freeman corroborated Patient A's testimony. They both testified to the procedures Brown performed on them, which they described as the same as those he performed on Patient A. They also testified that Brown referred to himself as a doctor and told them he had been a practicing chiropractor for 20 years without mentioning his expired license. They also signed his forms without reading them thoroughly, paid for their treatments, and had no religious discussions with Brown. Brown did not deny any of these facts, except to state that he was not performing any form of treatment on Patient A, Falco, and Freeman, and that his pulling on the head was not forceful. He testified that he was performing the alphabiotic alignment process, and not a chiropractic adjustment. He also testified that the alphabiotic alignment process is a sacrament of the Alphabiotic Church and that Patient A, Falco, and Freeman were members of the church and acknowledged in the forms they signed that they were not receiving chiropractic or other treatment. He also said there were no materials in his office referring to chiropractic practice, and that all materials, diplomas, and documents referred to alphabiotics. He stated that he was trained in alphabiotics in Texas by Dr. Virgil Chrane and others. After an eight-month training period, he was awarded a Doctor of Alphabiotics degree; that is the degree he refers to when he uses the title 'Doctor.' Brown stated that he learned the alphabiotic alignment process from Chrane, who was also a chiropractor. On March 9, 1999, the Commission issued a statement of charges alleging that Brown committed unprofessional conduct by, among other things, practicing chiropractic medicine without a license, representing to his patients that he was a chiropractor when his license was expired, failing to exercise reasonable care when performing a chiropractic manipulation of Patient A's spine, failing to warn Patient A that she could suffer a stroke as a result of the manipulation, and failing to take proper emergency care procedures when Patient A displayed stroke symptoms. On January 27, 2000, there was an adjudicative hearing before a panel of four Commission members, which included three licensed chiropractors. Brown chose to represent himself at the hearing. On March 14, 2000, the Commission issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and final order. It found that Brown's treatment was a chiropractic procedure, that he practiced chiropractic medicine without a license, that he misled Patient A into believing he was licensed, and that his treatment of Patient A was severely negligent. The Commission concluded Brown committed professional malpractice in violation of RCW 18.130.180(4),(7),(8)(a),(13), RCW 18.24.112(1), and RCW 18.25.011, revoked his license for 10 years, imposed a $30,000 fine, issued a cease and desist order prohibiting him from performing chiropractic procedures until his license is reinstated, and prohibited him from representing himself as a licensed chiropractor. Brown appealed the Commission's final order to superior court which affirmed the Co mmission. This appeal followed. DISCUSSION The Commission concluded that Brown violated RCW 18.25.011 and RCW 18.130.180. RCW a violation of RCW 18.130.190 for any person to practice chiropractic in this state unless the person has obtained a license as provided in this chapter.' RCW 18.130.180 pertains to 'conduct, acts, or conditions {that} constitute unprofessional conduct for any license holder or applicant under the jurisdiction of this chapter{.}' Brown maintains that the Commission lacked jurisdiction over his case because RCW 18.130.180 only applies to licensed chiropractors and his license was expired. He asserts that the Commission cannot both argue that he was in violation by practicing without a license and that as a license holder his conduct was unprofessional. We disagree. The State argues that if the Commission is unable to investigate unlicensed persons for unprofessional conduct under RCW 18.130.180 until they seek reinstatement, evidence and witnesses will become stale or lost. Because the Secretary of the Department of Health has the same authority to investigate those practicing without a license as the Commission has to investigate unprofessional conduct, Brown argues that a Health Department investigation would preserve evidence and witnesses. The evidence the Secretary discovers could then be used to deny reinstatement. But this fact does not deprive the Commission of jurisdiction over persons with expired licenses. The State contends that the Commission has jurisdiction over Brown under WAC 246-11-090(1) and that case law from other jurisdictions agrees. WAC 246-11-090(1) provides: The board has jurisdiction over all licenses issued by the board and over all holders of and applicants for licenses as provided in RCW 18.130.040(2)(b) and (3). Such jurisdiction is retained even if an applicant requests to withdraw the application, or a licensee surrenders or fails to renew a license [1]. Brown asserts that the Legislature did not give the Commission jurisdiction to make findings of unprofessional conduct under RCW 18.130.180 and RCW 18.130.050(2) [2] against an unlicensed person because the regulation conflicts with the statutes. This contention is without merit. RCW 18.130.050(2) gives the Commission authority to investigate and hold hearings on 'all . . . reports of unprofessional conduct.' Because the statute does not distinguish between expired and active licenses, it gives the Commission jurisdiction over any person who has held a license and appears to have engaged in unprofessional conduct. In Wang v. Board of Registration in Medicine [3 ], the Massachusetts Supreme Court faced the same issue. The physician contested the disciplinary board's jurisdiction because his license had expired before the board initiated proceedings against him. The Wang court concluded that the agency retained jurisdiction over the physician because, like RCW 18.130.050(2), a state statute authorized the board to \"investigate all complaints relating to the proper practice of medicine by any person holding a certificate of registration.\" [4] Even though the physician failed to renew his license, it could be revived upon completion of the renewal process. Thus, the Wang court held that even though the physician did not have a license that could be revoked, the board had jurisdiction to revoke his 'inchoate right to reestablish his status as a licensed physician in Massachusetts simply by completing the renewal process [5]. The Wang court also concluded that, while the board could wait to initiate proceedings until the physician filed for renewal, {w}e cannot say, however, as a matter of law, that the board must wait for Wang's renewal application to initiate disciplinary proceedings rather than doing so when his misconduct became known to the board. The board's purpose is protection of the public interest, and when the board exercises its statutory function of conducting disciplinary proceedings, it is pursuing that purpose. . . .[6] The Wang court reasoned that '{i}t is logical and sensible that, where such grave charges of . . . unprofessional or dishonorable conduct are alleged, the Board has the right to preserve {any} evidence . . . of these charges; otherwise witnesses may disappear and the passage of time itself may well dim or even eradicate the memory of the witnesses and thus preclude the construction of an adequate record.'. . .[7] Brown argues that Wang is inapposite because Wang held his license when his unprofessional conduct occurred. He contends we should follow the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision in Stern v. Connecticut Medical Examining Board [8 ]. His argument is not persuasive. First, both Wang's and Brown's licenses had expired when disciplinary proceedings began. Second, the statutory scheme in Stern is different from ours. In Connecticut, when a physician does not renew his license within 90 days, it automatically becomes void under Connecticut law [9]. In both Washington and Massachusetts, the statutes provide that a license that is not renewed 'shall be automatically revoked, but shall be revived upon completion of the renewal process [10]. As in Wang, a chiropractor with an expired license in Washington has an inchoate right to reestablish his status as a licensed chiropractor simply by completing the renewal process [11]. For the same public policy reasons the Wang court relied on, we hold that the Commission had jurisdiction over Brown. Brown next contends that he was denied due process because the Commission's findings of fact 2.14 and 2.15 are not supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. We review agency orders in adjudicative proceedings under the Administrative Procedure Act, and review is confined to the administrative record [12]. The reviewing court must give due deference to the agency's knowledge and expertise [13]. But the findings of fact must also be supported by substantial evidence, which is \"evidence in sufficient quantum to persuade a fair-minded person of the truth of the declared premises.\" [14] Finding of fact 2.14 provides in part: Based on its own expertise, the Commission finds that the procedure performed by the Respondent on Patient A, which he calls the Alphabiotic Alignment Process, is indistinguishable from the chiropractic adjustment known as the Chrane condyle lift, which was taught by Virgil Chrane while he was still practicing as a chiropractor. The Commission finds that the Chrane condyle lift is a useful but potentially dangerous chiropractic adjustment, and that one of the significant risks of the Crane condyle lift is dissection of vertebral arteries and resulting stroke. . . . Specifically, Brown asserts that there is insubstantial evidence to find that (1) Chrane taught the Chrane condyle lift and (2) the Chrane condyle lift is potentially dangerous and may cause a stroke. Again, we disagree. Brown's first assertion fails because the record contains substantial supporting evidence. Panel members questioned Brown about the Chrane condyle lift and about his training under Chrane. Brown also testified that Chrane was a chiropractor before he founded the Alphabiotic New Life Church in 1972. Based on this evidence and on the Commission's own expertise, there was substantial evidence to support the finding. And even if the finding were somehow infirm, it is not necessary to the Commission's conclusion that Brown performed a chiropractic procedure and that his conduct was unprofessional. Brown's second assertion fails because the Commission has statutory authority to use its expertise to find that the chiropractic procedure is dangerous. RCW 34.05.461(5) provides that '{w}here it bears on the issues presented, the agency's experience, technical competency, and specialized knowledge may be used in the evaluation of evidence.' In Washington Medical Disciplinary Board v. Johnston, the Supreme Court stated that the board's conclusion that the respondent violated accepted surgical standards without specific evidence in the record on the standards was proper [15]. Since the board is composed strictly of licensed physicians, RCW 18.72.040, and since RCW 34.04.100(4) permits agencies to utilize the specialized knowledge of their members in evaluating evidence presented to them, we believe it is logical and proper for the State Medical Disciplinary Board to draw its own conclusions as to acceptable surgical standards. As to such specialized matters, we give deference to administrative expertise [16]. In Davidson v. Department of Licensing [17], Dr. Davidson argued that the board could not rely on its own expertise to find that a vibrator massage was improper chiropractic treatment and that his conduct was in part sexually motivated. In response, the Davidson court stated that {i}t is well settled that when acting in a judicial capacity, an administrative board cannot base its findings and conclusions upon undisclosed documentary evidence or personal knowledge of the facts. However, an administrative agency, or its authorized agents, may use their experience and specialized knowledge to evaluate and draw inferences from the evidence presented to them. Moreover, courts of numerous jurisdictions, including Washington, have held that in a medical disciplinary proceeding an administrative board comprised of medical practitioners is competent to determine the propriety of medical conduct without the aid of expert testimony. These courts have recognized that expert testimony regarding the propriety of medical conduct could be disregarded by a board of this type and in all probability would have little effect on the decisionmaking process [18]. Similarly, the finding here that the Chrane condyle lift is potentially dangerous and can pose a risk of stroke is well within the Commission's expertise and authority. Three of the Commission's four panel members were licensed chiropractors who had the specialized knowledge of chiropractic techniques to evaluate the procedure at issue. Like the tribunals in Johnston and Davidson, the Commission members were 'competent to determine the propriety of medical conduct.' [19] We do not substitute our judgment for that of the Commission. The Commission's finding is supported by substantial evidence. Brown next argues that finding of fact 2.15 is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Finding of fact 2.15 provides in part: The Commission further finds the Respondent's performance of the Chrane condyle lift, without advising patients of the risk of stroke, and without adequate training to recognize such strokes, was below the standard of care required of chiropractors in the state of Washington. The Respondent acknowledged his response to Patient A's symptoms was insufficient, and that he should have called for emergency help. . . . Brown's first assertion, that the Commission improperly found he lacked sufficient training to recognize strokes, fails because the record contained substantial supporting evidence. The Commission questioned him about the training he received from Chrane and the qualifications necessary to be admitted to Chrane's school of alphabiotics. Brown testified that he allowed his chiropractic license to expire because he would need 'a major amount of schooling' to qualify as a chiropractor. He also admitted that he was 'lax' and 'amiss' in failing to get Patient A assistance. And when questioned about what symptoms he would need to see before suggesting that a patient go to the emergency room, he testified he did not know. This was substantial evidence supporting the Commission's finding that Brown lacked training to recognize strokes. Brown also contests the finding that his conduct was below the standard of care required for chiropractors in Washington. He asserts that the risk of stroke from the Chrane condyle lift is not common knowledge among chiropractors because the procedure is not taught in chiropractic schools, there are no studies on the subject, and there is no prior Commission ruling about the procedure. But because the Commission may use its experience and specialized knowledge to evaluate the evidence, this portion of the finding was within its competence. It is proper for a Commission made up of experts in the field to make findings about acceptable chiropractic standards [20]. Finally, Brown maintains that state regulation of his conduct infringes on his right to free exercise of religion. In rejecting his contention in conclusion of law 3.3, the Commission stated: Under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 11 of the Washington State Constitution, which both protect the free exercise of religion, the right to believe is absolute, but the right to act is not. . . . The legislature has selected measures to protect the public health, including requiring those employing the techniques and procedures of chiropractic to be license by the state and to abide by state regulation. As demonstrated by the facts of this case, the use of chiropractic techniques, when unregulated by the state, can result in harm to the public health. Therefore, the Commission concludes that its regulation of the Respondent's actions, to the extent they involve the practice of chiropractic and the use of chiropractic techniques, does not impermissibly burden the Respondent's free exercise of his religion [21]. Brown maintains that affirming the Commission's order abolishes the Alphabiotic Church because the Commission found Brown's conduct, which he asserts is the essential sacrament and teaching of the Alphabiotic church, was a chiropractic technique. The issue is whether Brown's activities constitute chiropractic techniques, and if so, whether they are sufficiently dangerous to warrant government regulation. Brown seeks protection under the free exercise clause of both the Washington State Constitution [22] and the Federal Constitution. Free exercise of religion includes both the freedom to believe and the freedom to act [23]. While the former is absolute, the latter is not [24]. An individual's conduct is subject to regulation for society's protection [25]. 'The freedom to act must have appropriate definition to preserve the enforcement of that protection, and, in turn, exercise of the power to regulate must not unduly impose on protected freedom.' [26] Any burden on free exercise of religion must withstand strict scrutiny. Once the complaining party establishes that government action has a coercive effect on his or her practice of religion, the government must show that the restrictions serve a compelling state interest and are the least restrictive means for achieving that interest [27]. Compelling interests are those based upon the necessities of national or community life such as threats to public health, peace, and welfare [28]. An individual engaging in a commercial activity must adhere to health and safety regulations that support the compelling interest in protecting the public, even if this results in a burden on the individual's freedom of religion [29]. In State v. Verbon [30], the Supreme Court held that prosecuting a preacher for practicing medicine without a license did not violate his constitutional right to religious freedom. Brown argues that Verbon is distinguishable because Verbon's practice of medicine was merely a tenet of the church and not one of its sacraments. We find this assertion unpersuasive because Brown's conduct involves chiropractic procedure. Like Verbon, Brown was engaged in the practice of medicine in violation of the law because he performed chiropractic treatments without a license. Brown would not be prohibited from performing the procedure so long as he was licensed and followed the law. Because he has available an avenue to resume performing this alignment, his freedom to practice his religion is not significantly burdened. In Backlund v. Board of Commissioners [31], the Supreme Court concluded that there is a compelling interest in the requirement that physicians purchase professional liability insurance which overrides a physician's religious beliefs. Brown argues that Backlund is distinguishable because the doctor had a choice of not working at a particular hospital, and thus the hospital did not infringe on his religious beliefs. We find this argument unpersuasive because it is not part of the court's decision. The Backlund court held that there was a compelling government interest in requiring Backlund to purchase liability insurance. As in this case, it only needed to reach this issue if it concluded that his religious beliefs were burdened. Here, the Commission found the government interest in protecting the public from Brown's dangerous practices compelling, and we agree. Even acknowledging that Brown has a sincere religious belief and that the Commission's order is a burden on the free exercise of religion, the government has a compelling interest in protecting its citizens from the kind of dangerous practice that caused Patient A's stroke. The trial court properly affirmed the Commission's order. Affirmed. For the Court Hon.

[ Hide Full Content](#three-thousand-nine-hundred-forty-six) [Prolonged Fasting](https://quackwatch.org/ncahf/articles/e-i/fasting/) Fasting involves voluntary total food deprivation (water only or distilled water only), juice-fasting which permits fruit juices or distilled water and lemon juice. Fasting has a long history as a symbolic demonstration of religious devotion, act of protest, or commitment to a political cause. Various so-called \"natural health\" or \"hygienic\" practitioners advocate fasting to \"cleanse the body\" or as a cure-all. Herbert Shelton, advocate of \"natural hygiene\"[1] and originator of the erroneous idea of \"food combining\" popularized by the best-selling pseudonutrition book Fit For Life, was an influential advocate of fasting. Other Shelton disciples include: Judy Mazel, author of The Beverly Hills Diet (1981), said to be \"ludicrous\" and \"full of misinformation so strange that it would be funny, except that so many people seem ... Fasting involves voluntary total food deprivation (water only or distilled water only), juice-fasting which permits fruit juices or distilled water and lemon juice. Fasting has a long history as a symbolic demonstration of religious devotion, act of protest, or commitment to a political cause.

Herbert Shelton, advocate of \"natural hygiene\"[1] and originator of the erroneous idea of \"food combining\" popularized by the best-selling pseudonutrition book Fit For Life, was an influential advocate of fasting. Other Shelton disciples include: - Judy Mazel, author of The Beverly Hills Diet (1981), said to be \"ludicrous\" and \"full of misinformation so strange that it would be funny, except that so many people seem to believe it.\" - Firewalk guru Tony Robbins, author of Unlimited Power which also taught nutrition nonsense (See NCAHF Newsletter, Jan-Feb, 1995). Contrary to the teachings of proponents, fasting doesn't \"cleanse\" or \"rest\" the liver. If anything, fasting overworks the liver by saturating it with toxins produced by fasting itself [2]. Fasting can be dangerous, especially when undertaken or supervised by ideologists who are blind to its actual effects. Shelton's fasting regime was responsible for several deaths. A 49-yr-old man died of bronchial pneumonia that resulted from a 30-day distilled water diet sponsored by \"Dr. Shelton's Health School\" in Texas (said to be sixth such death in five years while undergoing treatment at the school) [3] Proponents of fasting often evoke the dangerous \"healing crisis\" theory of naturopathy alleging that adverse symptoms experienced by the faster are \"poisons being expelled by the body.\" The misguided theory that adverse symptoms should be expected and welcomed as the body's \"re-tracing\" is explained by Stanley Bass, ND, DC, PhC (Philosopher of Chiropractic): The toxins being discarded are saving you from more serious disease which will result if you keep them in your body too much longer-possibly hepatitis, kidney disorders, blood disease, heart disease, arthritis, nerve degenerations or even cancer-depending upon your hereditary or structural weaknesses. Be happy you're paying your bills now in an easy payment plan. With some, colds which haven't appeared for a long time may occur, or even fevers. THIS IS NATURE'S WAY OF HOUSECLEANING. DON'T\u2014but DON'T try to stop these symptoms ...These symptoms are part of a curing process, and don't try to cure a cure. Those who have lived worse lives and poisoned themselves more will experience more severe symptoms. Headaches may occur at the beginning; fever and/or colds may appear; the skin may break out; there may be a short interval of bowel sluggishness, occasional diarrhea, feelings of tiredness and weakness, disinclination to exercise, nervousness, irritability, negativity or mental depression, frequent urination, etc. REALIZE DEEPLY that your body is becoming younger and healthier every day because you are throwing off more and more wastes which would eventually have brought pain, disease and suffering. Those who have the worst symptoms . . . and follow through to their successful termination are thus avoiding some of the worst diseases which would eventually have developed had they continued their careless eating habits. The notion that adverse symptoms should be disregarded, or even rejoiced about, caused Bivian Lee to ignore serious symptoms of cardiac myopathy that developed during a very-low-calorie Herbalife diet program. When Lee blacked out, his wife discovered his condition and made an appointment for him to see a physician. Sadly, Lee died in front of his 4-year-old daughter before the appointment could be kept [4]. Physical Effects of Fasting Except for the brain, which consumes more calories than any other organ and has a constant need for glucose whether one is asleep or awake, one's metabolic rate varies with physical activity and by day and nightime effects. The body's ongoing need for nutrition is met by stores in the cells and liver, circulating blood, and gastrointestinal contents. Fasting causes blood sugar to drop. This leads to a breakdown (catabolism) of muscle and other protein tissue for energy. During fasting, catabolism is a kind of \"self-cannibalism\" the by-products of which (ammonia and urea) lead to acidosis that produces weakness, fatigue, irritability, depression, depressed libido, and a sick feeling. Fasting does not cleanse the system, but loads it with metabolic toxins while decreasing its ability to destroy and excrete these. Fasting leads to rapid loss of water, sodium, and potassium. This decreases blood volume which produces postural hypotension (low blood pressure when standing up), and fainting. Severe potassium depletion can cause a fatal heart rhythm disturbance. The body cannot differentiate between voluntary fasting and starvation and deaths have occurred even with medically supervised fasts and near-fasts. People who survive prolonged fasts (starvation) may suffer anemia, decreased immunity, osteoporosis, kidney damage, or liver damage. Depressed gastrointestinal or digestive functions may persist for weeks or months [v]. The worst thing about fasting is its destruction of lean and vital tissue needed for a healthy and active life. Fasting, like colonic irrigation, laxatives, sweat baths, and other naturopathic regimes are at best useless, and at worst, can be fatal. Fasting is particularly dangerous for children. Case. A 3.5 yr-old girl died of malnutrition and pneumonia following a 27-day water fast [6]. Her parents were disciples of a naturopath, Kenneth Jaffrey, who believed that fasting was beneficial. The couple placed the little girl on a diet of distilled water for 27 days to clean her body of toxins that they believed had built up through expose to orthodox medicine. The girl's father was described as \"intolerant of medical practitioners\" and \"arrogant in view of life.\" At death, the child was half of her expected weight [7]. Case. A 9-year-old girl died in Ottawa, Canada after being on a water-only diet for 40-days. Mellissa Larochelle was treated at home in the northern Ontario town of Hearst with the diet which, according to provincial police \"apparently has some religious overtones to it. It's somehow connected to the 40 days and nights Jesus fasted and its supposed to purge your system,\" they said. Mellissa was seized by the Children's Aid Society and hospitalized in Ottawa but died on March 16, 1990. The girl's grandmother, Rollande Turgeon, 55, was sentenced to 6 months in jail on January 18, 1991 after pleading guilty to negligence causing bodily harm. Turgeon had taken courses and was accredited by the American Hygiene Association. She operated a so-called fasting clinic at her house. Turgeon was treating Mellissa for an ear infection. In passing sentence the judge said that Turgeon had made a grave error in judgment by not contacting doctors sooner. He stated that \"she was blinded by the principles of fasting and didn't believe in medical intervention.\" [8] Psychology of Fasting The psychology of fasting is consistent with asceticism (self-denial). Ascetics find pleasure in pain. This reversal of perception is rooted in a negative self-concept. Ascetics feel badly when good things happen to them because they do not feel worthy. They feel good when they are deprived of what gives normal people pleasure because they are getting what they feel they deserve. Puritans were ascetics. They are remembered for the concept that \"if it feels good, don't touch it,\" \"if it tastes good, don't eat it,\" and \"if it looks good, cover your eyes!\" Ascetics love to give up things. When they are sick they often think, \"If I give up something more, I will be better.\" Fasting and austere diets that amount to near-fasting have appeal to ascetics for whom sacrifice has become the route to health and eternal salvation. Little wonder that many religious zealots demonstrate their extreme devotion by fasting. The importance of psychological factors in the desire to fast can be seen in case reports. Case. A 36-yr-old male adherent to the Temple Beautiful diet died of malnutrition attempting to become a holy man who could live on air alone. Five years earlier, David Blume had been pursuing an idyllic career as an English teacher at Nathaniel Hawthorne college in New England. His students loved him. He was a tall, handsome man with clear, bright eyes and a gift for sharing ideas. Blume lost his teaching job because of budget cuts, and was unable to secure satisfactory employment. During his period of vulnerability, he meet Steven Haasz, founder and leader of Temple Beautiful. Haasz was a disciple of Ann Wigmore, originator of the wheatgrass fad. Blume chose the most rigorous of the group's dietary options and began subsisting almost entirely on raw wheatgrass juice. His aim was to become a \"breatharian\"\u2014a holy man who could live on air alone. On October 6, 1979, Blume's lifeless body was found on the floor of his shabby Philadelphia apartment. He was 6 feet tall and weighed 87 lbs [9]. Case. Several \"patients\" of Arthur Andrews, operator of the California Health Sanctuary at Hollister, CA, died following prolonged fasting. The California medical licensing board brought charges against Andrews for practicing medicine without a license because the purpose of the fasting had been to heal medical conditions. The defense argued that Andrews' regime was intended to \"heal the soul,\" which was a religious matter. Andrews was fined $1,000 for the unlawful practice of medicine, but was allowed to continue operating as a religious retreat as long as he did not practice medicine [10]. NCAHF strongly advises against the use of prolonged fasting for health purposes, and believes that requiring children to fast is a form of child abuse.
