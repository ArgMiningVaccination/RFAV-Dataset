This Phase I randomizedcontrolled clinical trial in human immunodeciency virus type 1-negative volunteers investigated whe-ther the site and mode of DNA vaccination influences the quality of induced cellular and humoral immuneresponses following the DNA priming phase and subsequent protein boost with recombinant clade C CN54gp140. A strategy of concurrent i.d. and i.m. DNA immunizations administered with or without EP wasadopted. Subtle differences were observed in the shaping of vaccine-induced virus-specic CD4 +and CD8 induced 100% in all of the groups. A single, non- adjuvanted protein boost induced a rapid and profound increase in binding antibodies in all groups, with atrend for higher responses in i.d. EP+i.m. EP. The magnitude of antigen-specic binding immunoglobulin G correlated with neutralization of closely matched clade C 93MW965 virus and Fc-dimer receptor binding(FccRIIa and Fc cRIIIa). These results offer new perspectives on the use of combined skin and muscle DNA immunization in priming humoral and cellular responses to recombinant protein. Keywords: HIV, DNA vaccine, electroporation, antibody, gp140 INTRODUCTION DNA- BASED VACCINATION is an attractive mode of vaccine delivery, particularly against viral infec- tions. DNA vaccines utilize the host for in vivo biosynthesis of transgene products,1hence imitat- ing host cell modications, the transgeneproducts more accurately represent the naturally expressed viral antigens. 2A lackof anti-vector immunity provides the opportunity for serial immunizations with multiple DNA de- rived immunogens. DNA vaccination is typically used as a component of heterologous prime-booststrategies. In the context of generating humoral responses, prime-boost vaccination is generally thought to induce memory T-cell responses 3able to boost subsequent T cell-dependent antibody re- sponses to recombinant antigens.4However, the *Correspondence: Dr. Robin John Shattock, Imperial College London, Department of Medicine, Section of Virology, Group of Mucosal Infection and Imm unity, London, United Kingdom.

For personal use only. extent to which DNA vaccination is able to prime antigen-specic B cells directly, influencing their antigen specicity, is less clear and likely depen- dent on the intrinsic antigenicity of the vaccinatingimmunogen. In this respect, the human immuno- deciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycopro- tein presents a particular challenge, known to bepoorly immunogenic due in part to the very high density of glycans that restrict antibody recogni- tion of the underlying protein. 5,6Indeed, with two notable exceptions,7,8the majority of clinical vac- cine studies using injected naked plasmid DNA encoding HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins have failedto induce detectable antibody responses. 9 Nevertheless, over recent years, the immuno- genicity of DNA vaccines has been signicantlyenhanced through the use of promoter selection and codon optimization. 1Furthermore, the deliv- ery of DNA in association with electroporation (EP)has been shown to increase gene expression and vaccine-induced responses dramatically. 10-13EP generates an electric eld at the vaccine site, cre-ating temporary cell membrane instability, thereby facilitating increased uptake of DNA. Importantly, the inflammation associated with EP is also thoughtto enhance antigen-presenting cell (APC) recruit- ment. 14,15In recent Phase I HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine trials, DNA vaccination with EP has beenshown to improve cell-mediated immunity (CMI), while its impact on antibody induction was minimal or below the level of detection. 16,17The route of vaccination is also thought to have profound effects on prevailing immune responses. Most DNA vacci- nations are delivered via the intramuscular (i.m.)route. 16However, the low number of APC within muscle tissues may be a rate-limiting factor in in- ducing robust humoral responses.1,18,19By contrast, the skin has relatively high numbers of resident APC able to migrate to the draining lymph nodes via lymphatic drainage where they preferentially in-teract with CD4 +T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, in- ducing naive B cells to make antibody. 20However, the volumes that can be delivered via the intrader-mal (i.d.) route are much smaller than can be de- livered i.m., providing a practical constraint when considering this route. Few clinical studies have directly compared the performance of the two routes for delivery of DNA, but preliminary data suggesti.d. administration to be dose sparing and superior with or without EP. 21,22These ndings +T-cell responses are seen after i.d. administration of a DNA vaccine, even at 20% of the dose, when the same vaccine is ad-ministered i.m. 23Furthermore, comparative studiesof i.d. in macaques antibody responses EP, while cell-mediated response induced by i.m. EPwere 10-fold higher than those induced by i.d. EP.24The predictive nature of these studies for human immu- nogenicity is unclear. This study sought to develop a DNA priming strategy capable of reproducibly inducing detect- able B-cell responses, evident before boosting withrecombinant protein. This has important relevance to current multicomponent approaches for induc- ing protective HIV-1 antibody responses, where aseries of immunogens maybe required to focus humoral immune responses to recognize rarely induced broadly neutralizing epitopes. 6Given the high cost of recombinant protein manufacture, the potential use of a series of DNA priming immuni- zations prior to boosting of responses with a singlerecombinant protein would provide an attractive and cost-effective strategy for evaluating multi- component vaccines. It was hypothesized that combining the i.d. route, which allows the vaccine to reach a site with a plentiful and diverse number of APCs, 25with con- current i.m. vaccination, which allows delivery of a higher concentration of DNA, might result in en- hanced immune responses to the in vivo -expressed plasmid DNA vaccine transgenes. Previous pre- clinical murine studies supported this hypothesis, but the extent to which this would translate to hu-man studies was unclear. 26More recently, in a hu- man clinical study using a T cell-based vaccine, it was observed that combined i.d. and i.m. vaccinationdifferentially impacted the quality of effector T-cell functions. 27This study sought to optimize this reg- imen to augment vaccine-induced humoral immu-nity. As a rst phase in developing this approach, a single DNA plasmid vector expressing CN54 gp140 was used to deliver HIV-1 Env as a priming vaccine immunogen. The impact of EP on concurrent i.d. and i.m. vaccinations to prime humoral and cellular re- sponses was evaluated prior to boosting with amodel recombinant HIV-1 vaccine antigen, CN54- gp140. The study deliberately did not use an adju- vant for the protein boost in order to differentiate clearly the impact of the different components of the concurrent regimens. While humoral antibody re-sponses were the principal focus of this study, gp140-specic cellular responses were also evalu- ated, as CD4 T-cell help is critical not only for thedevelopment of cytotoxic CD8 responses but also for the development of Env-specic functional antibody responses. The results presented here demonstratethat concurrent i.d./i.m. vaccination is a highly effec-1012 CHEESEMAN ET AL. Downloaded by University Of Melbourne from www.liebertpub.com at 09/27/18.

EPcombi- nation generated both T- and B-cell responses that were dramatically amplied by a homologous proteinboost in the absence of additional adjuvantation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the rst clinical study to evaluate concurrent i.d./i.m.plasmid DNA vaccination as part of a DNA prime- protein boost strategy. METHODS Trial design CUTHIVAC002 was a randomized, open label, Phase I HIV vaccine trial in healthy volunteers aged 18-50 years. The target sample size was 24 partici-pants who completed all immunizations. Partici- pants were randomized CN54ENV at weeks 0, 4, and 8 and subsequently boosted with recombinant CN54gp140 at week 20 (Fig. 1A). The randomization method wasblock randomization using a computer-generated algorithm, stratied on sex, and implemented through the Cactus electronic data capture systemon the day of enrolment and rst immunization after conrmation of eligibility. Group 1 (i.d. EP+i.m.) received i.d. immunization EP (i.d. +i.m. EP) received i.d. immunization EP. Protein boosts were administered by i.d. injection. Each volunteer was invited to attend11 visits from screening through to 4 weeks after the nal immunization, with an additional week 44 visit to assess durability of induced humoral responses.Those who did not complete the immunization schedule were replaced without randomization. Clinical trial authorization was granted by the British Medicines and Healthcare products Reg- ulatory Agency. Favorable ethical approval opinion was given by the London Riverside Research EthicsCommittee, operating within the Research Ethics Service of the British Health Research Authority. The trial was registered with the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities for Clinical Trials (EudraCT) database and assigned the EudraCTNo. 2015-001023-23 and was registered with Clin- icalTrials.gov under protocol ID NCT02589795 (date of registration October 28, 2015). The trialwas performed at the NIHR Trust Imperial Clinical Research Facility, Hammersmith Hospital, Im- perial College Healthcare NHS Trust (London,United Kingdom).Study participants and eligibility criteria Healthy adults aged between 18 and 50 years at low risk of HIV-1 infection and with no clinicallysignicant medical history or disorder that pre- sented the potential for risk of influencing the re- sults or impairing the participant's ability toparticipate in the study were enrolled. All partici- pants provided written informed consent. Interventions Three different methods of delivering a DNA vaccine (DNA-C CN54ENV ) via combined i.m. and i.d. routes with and without EP were explored, allfollowed by a single recombinant HIV CN54gp140 administered by i.d. injection without EP. Staff were trained in the injection and EP techniques aspart of the derived from 97CN54 and was manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) by AjinomotoAlthea Technologies (San Diego, CA). The plasmid was formulated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, and supplied as a sterile solution forinjection.

Furthermore, the secreted by CHO is oligo-meric, and following purication is essentially tri- meric, with a projected mass of 420 kDa. Intradermal DNA administration DNA-C CN54ENV was administered in the ab- sence of EP as a 1 \u00b70.15 mL (0.6 mg) i.d. injection via a small needle (29 gauge), inserted into the dermis overlying the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm. An i.d. adapter (West Pharmaceutical Services,Inc., Exton, PA) was used to facilitate the injection and to ensure consistency of administration. The ''bleb'' or weal created was used as an indicator ofsuccessful injection into the i.d. layer.

Objectives and primary endpoint measures The main objective was to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of the three different methods of administering CN54ENV C clade DNA vaccine EP)f o l l o w e d by a single i.d. boost with recombinant CN54gp140 protein (Fig. 1A). The primary safety endpoint was a Grade 3 or above solicited local, systemic, or labora-tory adverse event, or any grade of other adverse event leading to a clinical decision to discontinue immunizations or with onset within 7 days of im-munization. The primary i mmunogenicity endpoint was the magnitude of antigen-specic systemic im- munoglobulin G (IgG) antibody binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using serum collected 2 weeks after the nal immunization.Reactogenicity and safety Participants were monitored in the clinic for at least 60 min after each vaccination, and contacted bytelephone a day later. They completed diary cards for 7 days, and returned for review within 7 days when they were asked about other adverse events and di-ary cards were checked. The grade of solicited local and systemic adverse events starting within 7 days of immunization, and other adverse events were re-corded in the case record form and diary card and entered in the study database for randomized par- ticipants. Systemic safety was also assessed throughroutine laboratory parameters (full blood count and differential, renal, and liver biochemistry), and re- ported in the electronic d atabase. Adverse events were graded using modied U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Division of AIDS criteria. Collection and processing of mucosal secretions Cervicovaginal secretions were collected from female volunteers using an Instead Softcup, a commercially available, self-inserted menstrualcup made of polyethylene. The Softcup was inserted into the upper vagina, left in place for at least 1 h, removed, and stored in a 50 mL Falcon tube at-80/C176C. Mucosal samples were collected at weeks 0, 20, and 22. Prior to processing the mucosal sam- ples, the Softcups containing cervicovaginal secre-tions were removed storage at -80/C176C and thawed overnight at 2-8 /C176C. Following centrifuga- tion at 400 gfor 15 min at 4 /C176C, an equal volume of extraction buffer (1 \u00b7protease inhibitor cocktail; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), 0.02% NaN 3(Sigma- St. Louis, MO), and 0.25 M NaCl (BDH) insterile PBS (Gibco, Waltham, MA)) was added to the secretion samples (1:1 dilution). Samples were then aliquoted and stored at -80/C176C until analysis. Rectal secretions were collected using a PVA sponge, pre-moistened with 50 lL saline and stored at-80/C176C. Sponges were removed from storage at -80/C176C, thawed on wet ice, and placed into a 50 mL tube containing a sterile 70 lm Falcon lter unit. Extraction buffer (500 lL) was added before centri- fugation at 400 gfor 10 min at 4 /C176C.

Sec- ondary antibody anti-human IgG was added at dilution and incubated for 1 h at 37 /C176C. Plates were developed with SureBlue TMB substrate (KPL, Insight Biotechnology, Lon- don, United Kingdom). The reaction was stopped after 5 min by adding TMB stop solution (KPL,Insight Biotechnology), and the absorbance was read at 450 nm on a VersaMax 96-well microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). TheELISA data are expressed as positive if the blank- subtracted OD 450 nm was above the predetermined cutoff of OD 0.2 nm and values are on the linearrange of the curve. To ensure assay sensitivity, a positive control composed of positive pooled plasma samples was used. Analyses of the data were per-formed using SoftMax Pro GxP software v6.5 (Molecular Devices). IgG subclasses 1-4 were investigated for serum samples only. The protocol was followed as above with the use of IgG1-4 standards (Abcam, Cam- by 1:200 streptavidin-HRP polis, MN), as previously described. 28 Antigen-specic IgA/G antibody responses were measured in the mucosal compartments (vaginal and rectal) at weeks 0, 20, and 22 using a super-sensitive polyHRP ELISA.

DNA vaccination with and without EP and protein boost schedule was well tolerated in healthyHIV-negative adult volunteers Study volunteers were recruited between Au- gust 2016 and February 2017. Twenty-eight werescreened during the randomized period, with 24 deemed eligible and enrolled (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/hum). Two participants(i.d. EP+i.m. EP) withdrew consent, and one (i.d. EP+ i.m.) was lost to follow-up during the immunization period. The TDS-ID device failed to deliver the rstdose of vaccine in a fourth participant (CV024B) included in i.d. EP+i.m. EP(Fig. 1B). Seven volun- teers were screened and four additional eligibleparticipants enrolled to replace the individuals who did not complete their immunizations, mat- ched on sex but not age. One (i.d. EP+i.m.) of the four replacement participants did not receive the CN54gp140 boost because, for personal reasons, he wished to minimize the longevity of vaccine-induced seroreactivity in HIV tests. A total of 28 volunteers received 103 of 112 planned doses of vaccines between August 30, 2016, and July 17,2017, and 23 completed the immunization sched- ule. The majority of randomized participants were white British (71%) and male (75%) with a meanage of 27 years. The four participants recruited to replace those who did not complete their immuni- zations were similar, with a mean age of 33 years(Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). All participants attended the safety visit within a week of their last immunization, and 25 attendedthe nal safety visit at week 24. There were no adverse events that resulted in a clinical decision to discontinue vaccines among randomized and non-randomized participants. There was one serious adverse event: a road trafc accident that occurred 5 months after the last vaccine. There were twosevere (grade 3) solicited events reported by ran- domized participants: arm discomfort after the third vaccination (i.d. EP+i.m.) and elevated as- partate transaminase after individ- uals reported two events after her third immunization: severe tiredness and severe general muscle aches. There were 23 non-solicited adverse events with onset within 7 days of immu-nization reported by randomized participants and two by non-randomized participants; these were mainly musculoskeletal or infection, and they were mild or moderate in severity. Of the 365 events reported by the randomized participants, which includes the primary outcomes described above, 342 (94%) were solicited local, systemic, or laboratory events, 335 (92%) weremild, and 263 (72%) local to the injection site (Supplementary Table S4). The most common ad- verse events were discomfort and redness in thearm, discomfort in the leg, and blistering at the site1018 CHEESEMAN ET AL.

Of 57 blistering events, 15 were moderate in grade, making this the commonest moderate adverse event observed in all groups, most frequent after the last immunization (Sup-plementary Tables S5 and S6). Concurrent i.d. and i.m. DNA vaccination with EP enhances antibody responseto HIV-1 gp140 pre- and post-boosting with recombinant protein Antibody responses were determined 1 week post nal DNA vaccination (week 9). All individu- als in i.d. EP+i.m. (group1) 9, rising to 8/8 (100%) at the time of protein i.m. EP, 8/9 (88.8%) individuals seroconverted by week 9, with an additional seroconversion detected on the day of protein boost (group 3; Fig. 2A-C). This late responder (CV024B) was the one participantwhere the TDS-ID device failed to deliver the rst i.d. doses of the vaccine. Interestingly, for the ma- jority of individuals across the groups, antibody re-sponses continued to rise between weeks 9 and 20 (19/25; 76%). mBC ELISpot responses were concor- dant with seroconversion. Although there was nostatistical difference between groups in the median antibody binding response at week 9 post third DNA immunization, mBC responses were higher in i.d. EP +i.m. 2E; p=0.041). Nevertheless, all groups had similar mBC responses on protein boosting. Following protein boost, participants from i.d. EP+ i.m. (group 1) had a ng/mL (Q1-Q3: 9,884-38,050 ng/mL; Fig. 2A and D) at 2 weeks (week 22) post protein vaccination (primary endpoint). For the participants followedout to week 44, this dropped to 2,751 ng/mL (Q1-Q3: 461-13,225 ng/mL). One participant in this group chose not to receive a protein boost (CV910U) butwas followed out to study end, where the antibody responses had returned to baseline. A median re- sponse of 11,292 ng/mL (Q1-Q3: 9,608-15,568 ng/mL) 2 weeks boost was seen in i.d. + i.m. EP(group 2). For those participants followed out to week 44, this fell to 3,012 ng/mL (Q1-Q3: 1,425-3,720 ng/mL; Fig. 2B and D). The median anti- body response at 2 weeks post boost those participants in group 3 followed out to week 44, the median antibody re- sponse fell to 1,444 ng/mL (Q1-Q3: 476-20,634 ng/mL; Fig. by group, i.d. EP+ i.m. EP(group 3) displayed a trend for earlier re- sponses to the protein boost and elevated peak an-tibody response at the primary endpoint (week 22) when compared to groups 1 and 2 (Fig. 2A-C). However, this was not statistically signicant. Post protein boost, mBC responses were seen in all in-dividuals, except for the one individual in group 1 who declined their protein boost. Although there was no statistical difference between the threegroups, the highest mean response was in i.d. EP+ i.m. EP(group 3). To understand the functionality of the induced response further, the induced antibody isotype prole was then determined. There was a pre- dominant IgG1 response, with some sporadic in-duction of IgG2 and IgA (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, IgG3 responses, although low, were most repro- ducibly observed in groups 2 and 3 (7/8 and 8/9,respectively) while less frequent for group 1 (4/8). Subsequently, differences in the ability of vaccine- induced serum antibodies to interact with dimericFc receptors Fc cRIIIa and/or Fc cRIIa after binding to various HIV-1 clade Env proteins were investi- gated as an indirect readout for potential antibodydependent cellular cellular antibodies with capacity to bind FcR dimers were induced by the different prime-boost vaccine regimens. Overall, the ngerprint of Fc- receptor binding, associated with different HIV-1clades, was similar in pattern across the three groups. However, there was a trend for higher median response for both Env-specic Fc cRIIIa and (group 3; Fig. 2G and H). In all groups, homologous, group M consensus, clade C, F, and D bindingvaccine-induced antibodies were detected by the dimeric Fc cRIIIa cRIIa, while clade B were low orabsent, and clade A did not bind to dimeric FccRIIIa and Fc cRIIa. Low levels of neutralizing antibody were observed at week 22 against theclosely matched clade C tier 1 isolate 93MW965, in line with previous observations using this envelope construct 28,29,33(Fig. 2I). Cervical and rectal mucosal IgG and IgA specic antibody levels were also determined 2 weeks (week 22) post protein vaccination (primary end- point). No rectal IgA was detected in any of the participants, with rectal IgG being detected at lowlevels in only one participant from group 1 and group 3 (35 ng/mL and 52 ng/mL, respectively). Each of the vaccination groups contained twofemales. Therefore, cervical antibodies were de- termined for these participants. Cervical IgA was not detected in women from group 2 or group 3,with one participant in group 1 showing negligibleCOMBINED SKIN AND MUSCLE DNA VACCINATION 1019 Downloaded by University Of Melbourne from www.liebertpub.com at 09/27/18.

DNA vaccination prior to boosting with recombinant protein Next, the response prole of the induced CD4 cellular immune response was assessed by ICS as a marker of CD4 T-cell help. Analysis of the total number of responders to any of the measured pa-rameters following DNA vaccination (week 20) re- vealed a nonsignicant trend for fewer responders (5/8; 62.5%) in i.d.

EP+i.m. (group 1) or i.d. +i.m. EP(group 2) following DNA vaccination, although this did not reach statistical signicance, except for TNF- aresponses that were greater than those in group 1 (group 3; p=0.041, chop-lump test). Furthermore, there was a trend for i.d.EP+i.m. EP(group 3) to have a higher fraction of polyfunctional cells expressing all four markers (Fig. 3C) compared to the other two groups. There was little change in the response rate and overallresponse prole following protein boost. However, there was a trend for increased TNF- aand INF- c expression in i.d. and higher levels of polyfunctionality ( 3 parameters) relative to the other two groups (Fig. 3D). Con- versely, levels of single CD154-positive cells wereincreased in i.d. EP+i.m. (group 2) relative to groups 1 and 3 (Fig. 3D). CD8 T-cell responses are also differentially modulated by concurrent i.d. and i.m. DNAvaccination prior to boosting While the primary focus of this study was on factors influencing humoral responses, to assessthe wider implications of concurrent i.d. and i.m.DNA vaccination, the study also sought to deter- mine the impact on CD8 responses. ICS analysis of the total number of CD8 +T-cell responders following DNA vaccination (week 20) revealedhigher numbers in the two groups receiving i.d. EP, where i.d. EP+i.m. (group (75%) and 6/9 respond- ers, respectively, while only two (25%) responders in i.d. +i.m. EP(group 2) who did not receive i.d. EP.

EP(group 2; 3/8 [37.5%]). Analysis of the induced response prole in the responding CD8 cells fol-lowing DNA vaccination revealed an inherent bias toward CD154 responses in the two groups receiv- ing i.d.

EP(group 2) toward a more CD154 dominated prole (Fig. 4B and D) with stronger IL-2 responses. Unlike CD4 T-cell responses, polyfunctional analy- sis revealed that the greatest proportion of CD8 Tcells responding post DNA vaccination were single positive, with very few of the cells showing high poly-functionality associated with expression ofthree or four of the markers (Fig. 4C). As expected for exogenous protein immunogens, there was little change in the boost(Fig. 4D). EP modulates receiving concurrent i.d. and i.m. DNA vaccination prior to boosting with recombinant protein To facilitate comparison across vaccine studies, the differential impact of the individual DNA im- munization schedules on the induced cellular re-sponses was also assessed by IFN- cT-cell ELISpot. Positive IFN- cresponses 12 weeks post third DNA vaccination (week 20) were seen in 2/8 (25%) par-ticipants who received i.d. vac- cination (Fig. 5A). While there was no statistical difference in the number of responders between groups (chi-square test), the difference in magni-tude of the of IFN- cresponse was to peptide pools 1 and 2, with mean values of 238 SFU/ 106PBMC (95% CI 0-480 SFU/106PBMC) and 227COMBINED SKIN AND MUSCLE DNA VACCINATION 1021 Downloaded by University Of Melbourne from www.liebertpub.com at 09/27/18. For personal use only. SFU/106PBMC (95% CI 18-437 SFU/106PBMC) at week 20, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2C). The subsequent protein boost was associated with a marginal change in response rate at the primaryendpoint (week 22, 2 weeks following protein boost), where i.d. EP+i.m. (group 1) dropped to 1/8 (12.5%) participants EP+i.m. (group 2) and i.d. 5/8 (62.5%) (Fig. 5A).

There was no correlation between the magnitude of specic IgG and any of the cellular responses at week 22, both gamma interferonELISpot or CD4/CD8 ICS (Supplementary Fig. S3). As anticipated, there was a strong correlation be- tween total antigen-specic IgG and the predomi-nant antigen-specic IgG1 response ( r=0.89) no correlation with and Fc cRIIIa; Supplementary Figures 3 and 4). DISCUSSION This study sought to develop a DNA priming strategy capable of reproducibly inducing detect- able B-cell responses, evident before boosting withrecombinant protein. The rationale behind this approach was to select conditions that would fa- cilitate the use of DNA vaccines to evaluate a broadrange of immunogens used in series or as a cocktail to focus humoral immune responses to recognize rarely induced broadly neutralizing epitopes 6prior to amplication with a conventional recombinant protein boost. However, while the ability of DNA to prime CD4 T-cell responses is well established, theextent to which DNA vaccination is able to prime antigen specic B cells directly is less clear. Indeed, a review of previous HIV vaccines studies per-formed by the HIV vaccine Trials Network sug- gests that antibody responses are rarely elicited by DNA priming in the absence of EP. 9 To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the rst human study to determine the impact of DNA priming vaccination by combined i.d. and i.m. ad-ministration followed by i.d. boosting with recom- binant protein. In general, the different well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported during the trial. Encouragingly, 100% seroconversion was seen prior to the proteinboost across all three DNA priming regimes. Al- Figure 3. Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) CD4 T-cell analysis.

EP (group 3) displayed a trend for earlier responses and elevated peak antibody responses at the primary endpoint compared to groups 1 and 2. Larger stud-ies will be needed to determine if these differences are statistically signicant. It should be noted that i.d. and i.m. immunizations were administered todifferent limbs (arm and leg respectively) that drain to different lymph nodes. Whether this anatomical separation of the two injections is necessary for theobserved effects warrants further study. The dose of DNA delivered i.d. was also considerably lower (600 lg) than the i.m. dose (2 mg). Therefore, it cannot be excluded that administration of two con- current i.d./EP doses might be equivalent or greater than that of combined i.d./EP +i.m./EP with respect to antibody priming. A further limitation of this study is the lack of a control group that did not re- ceive EP by either route of administration. How-ever, previous studies showing the strong impact of EP on induced responses suggest this would have been inferior. 10-16There are no directly comparable human studies investigating combined i.d. +i.m. immunization to either i.d. or i.m. administered in the context of EP. The closest matched study is thatof Vasan et al. 16comparing i.m. administration expressing Clade C/B \u00a2env,gag,pol,nef,and tatgenes with and without EP delivered by the same device as used in this study. In this previous study, only one partici- pant displayed a transient very weak antibody re-sponse to gp120. A second study exploring the use of ID DNA administration for a multivalent vaccine encoding Env, Gag, Pol, with and without EP usinga different device (Dermavax), failed to show any benet from EP and no evidence of seroconversion to the DNA priming phase. 17 However, the responses to multigenic vaccines are likely to be different to those encoding a single HIV-1 Env sequence. A parallel ongoing study(DNAVAC) using the same DNA vaccine has failedto produce signicant suggest i.m. immunization in the context of EP issuperior to either i.d. or i.m. immunization alone. It should be noted that two previous clinical studies have reported seroconversion to HIV-1envelope following DNA priming in the absence of EP. The rst of these assessed responses following three injections of a six-plasmid HIV-1 DNA vac-cine encoding gp145 of subtype A, B, C, and Env a n ds u b t y p eBG a g ,P o l ,a n dN e fa d m i n i s t e r e db ya needle-free Biojector /C2102000.7This study reported a 71% seroconversion rate, with a median antibody titer of 800 to Env (A, C, B). Although the Biojector administration was targeted to the lateral deltoidmuscle, the ballistic nature of administration likely distributed DNA across both dermal and muscle tissue. A second study utilized a six-plasmid HIV-1 DNA vaccine encoding codon- optimized gp120 Env from subtypes, A, B( \u00b72), C, and E, and a subtype C Gag. 8When administered at a high dose (7.2 mg at each immunization) via i.m. injection divided between two sites in the absence of EP, 4/6 (66.7%) volunteers showed de-tectable Env-specic IgG, with median binding titers of 1,600. The higher dose, greater intrinsic immunogenicity of gp120 monomers over trimericgp140, and differences in expression plasmids likely account for higher seroconversion rates when compared to other studies. It is certainlypossible that this latter study did not involve the use of EP and might also be effective for priming responses to subsequent protein boost. Never-theless, neither of these two previous studies was able to match the 100% seroconversion following the combined i.d./i.m. DNA priming observed inthis study. Further work is required to determine whether such a difference provides signicant justication for the more complicated delivery pro-cedure. Interestingly, a prototype device for simul- taneous EP-enhanced DNA vaccine delivery to both skin and muscle is under development, offering thepotential to simplify the approach. 35 Figure 4.

In the current study, the magnitude of induced humoral responses following a single i.d. boost with recombinant CN54 gp140 in the absence of ad- juvant was similar to that previously observed following two immunizations with the same re- combinant protein (CN54 regimes.33The prime-protein boost regimes in this study induced apredominant IgG1 response with lower levels of IgG3. IgG2 responses were less evident than in previous studies using recombinant CN54 gp140adjuvanted in GLA-AF, 28suggesting the DNA priming phase promoted a more Th1 dominant re- sponse. In line with previous studies CN54 gp140induced low neutralizing antibody responses against a closely matched clade C tier 1 isolate MW965 with minimal reactivity ticular clade C, F, and D binding vaccine-inducedantibodies detected by the dimeric Fc cRIIIa and antibodies specic to clade A andB were either too low to crosslink dimeric FccRIIIa and Fc cRIIa. These responses mirror previous observations seen when using recombi-nant protein alone. 28The potential importance of ADCC has been highlighted by the RV144 trial in which robust HIV-specic ADCC responses werelinked to the observed partial protection. 36-38 using the CN54 gp140 Env suggest potentialADCC and/or would be restricted to cladesC, F, and D.Intramuscular EP appeared to have a positive impact on the response frequency of Env-specic CD4 responses elicited after to 62.5% for i.d. EP+i.m. Although not statistically relevant, this positive association ts that i.m. IFN- c, TNF- a, and IL-2) were greater in magnitude and had a higher fraction of polyfunc-tional cells ( 3 markers) than the other two groups. By contrast, i.d. EPappeared to have a positive im- pact on the response frequency of Env-specic in i.d. +i.m. EPgroup. Preferential induction of CD8 T cells responses by DNA vacci- nation of the skin concords with previous clinical studies using a T cell-based DNA vaccine.27Inter- estingly, when response rate was determined by IFN- cT-cell ELISpot, often assumed to be a marker of CTL response, hierarchy in the number of re-sponders of T-cell analysis by ICS demonstrated apredominance IFN- c-positive CD4 T cells rela- tive to CD8 T cells. This is in line with previous studies by Vasan et al. showing a predominant IFN- cCD4 T-cell response following i.m. EP16that were of a similar magnitude and frequency. Correlation analysis failed to show an associa- tion between any of the measured cell-mediated response parameters and the magnitude of binding antibody. These data suggest that the measuredcellular parameters have no impact on the magni- Figure 5.

Future studies will be required to assess the induction of better biomarkers of Tfh responsesin the systemic compartment and/or responding lymph nodes. 39Unsurprisingly, there was a strong correlation between total antigen-specic IgG andantigen-specic IgG1 responses ( r=0.89), with response. The antigen-specic IgG to Fc cIIIa likely reflect the observed subclass distribution of IgG1, 2, and 3 levels. IgG1 and bind well toboth Fc cRIIa IgG2 only binds well to Fc cRIIa. Collectively, the data presented here support the concept for the use of concurrent i.d. and i.m. DNA priming vaccination combinations as medi- ators of robust T- and B-cell responses, with pro-tein boost immunizations serving to amplify antibody levels efciently. The study objective of identifying a DNA priming strategy capable ofreproducibly inducing detectable antibody re- sponses in the majority of subjects was met. While the three DNA priming strategies each induced100% seroconversion, i.d. EP+i.m. EPperformed best. Interestingly, responses for the majority of the participants were maintained or increasedover the 12 weeks following the third DNA vacci- nation and the time of the protein boost. It would be interesting to know if additional concurrentDNA immunization might provide further gains in antibody titer. Molecular adjuvants were not used in order to differentiate clearly the impacts of thedifferent components of the concurrent regimens. However, additional gains might be mediated by the future inclusion of molecular adjuvants in theDNA-priming phase with potential impact on avidity and neutralization breadth. In the current phase of development, a single DNA plasmid wasused as a proof-of-concept study. The studies clearly demonstrate that the combined i.d. EP+ i.m. EPprotocol is capable of directly priming antigen-specic B cells. In future studies, it will be important to determine whether a series of DNAimmunogens and/or combinations can drive B-cell responses toward rarely induced broadly neutral-izing antibodies, with their potential amplication with a single protein boost. Such an approach has obvious attractions, given the relative savings in speed and cost of DNA manufacture comparedto other vaccine platforms. In this respect, the DNA prime-protein boost approach has potential not only to accelerate the testing of candidateHIV-1 vaccines with the aim of elucidating im- munogens capable of inducing broadly neutraliz- ing antibody responses, but also to provide a newplatform for the development of future vaccines against a wide range of existing or emerging pathogens.
