Liver problems can affect fertility in more ways than you'd expect. Many fertility patients turn to acupuncture to detox their livers and get their bodies ready for a healthy pregnancy. How Can Acupuncture Help? Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners believe that acupuncture can help protect patients from chronic liver disease. There are several ways in which acupuncture can help with detoxing the liver including helping you get more restful, peaceful sleep, improved overall health, and healthy brain function. [Acupuncture](https://anchoracu.com/treatment/) balances the liver's energies and removes toxins from different organs such as the colon, kidneys, and liver. In addition to filtering out toxins, acupuncture works to keep hormones in balance. Fertility acupuncturists in the East Bay suggest beginning treatment before, and continuing throughout, a pregnancy. Tips to Detox Your Liver Tame Your Temper According to TCM theory, excess irritability and anger can impact liver health. People who get angry often and easily are at high risk for developing liver disease. Do not let your emotions get the best of you. If you get frustrated easily, try breathing exercises. Brief meditation can help reduce anger and relieve stress. Steer Clear of Toxic Chemicals Avoid chemical cleaners, medications, and foods with excess artificial flavors & colors that can overwork your liver. Avoid drinking and eating from plastic bags, bottles, and steer clear of canned foods. Go to Bed at the Same Time Every Night The liver is most active between 1 AM and 3 AM. To avoid overworking your liver, go to bed at 10 PM every night. Do Not Skip Breakfast There are several disadvantages of skipping breakfast. Skipping breakfast will lower your energy levels, slow down your metabolism, and increase your risk of weight gain, heart disease, hormonal imbalance, and menstrual irregularity. Include foods rich in saturated fats in your breakfast as they will restore your glycogen levels, helping your liver function properly throughout the day. Switch to a Liver-friendly Diet Add liver-healthy foods such as kale, beets, carrots, artichoke hearts, dandelion leaves, parsley, and Brussel sprouts to your diet. Some of the best herbs for liver health to incorporate into your diet include garlic, green tea, and ginseng. Avoid Overexercising Excess of anything is bad. Not many people know that overexercising can overwhelm your liver. Show your liver some love. If you work out at a good intensity and are consistent, take a few days off exercising every so often to let your body rest and recover.
