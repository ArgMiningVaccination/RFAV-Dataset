Lanjouw Mark SchankermanAugust 25, 2014AbstractThis paper studies how patent rights and price regulation a\u00a7ect how fast new drugsare launched in di\u00a7erent countries, using newly constructed data on launches of 642 newdrugs in 76 countries for the period 1983-2002, and information on the duration andcontent of patent and price control regimes. Price regulation strongly delays launch,while longer and more extensive patent protection accelerates it. Health policy institu-tions, and economic and demographic factors that make markets more pro\u00d6table, alsospeed up di\u00a7usion. The e\u00a7ects are robust to using instruments to control for endo-geneity of policy regimes. The results point to an important role for patents and otherpolicy choices in driving the di\u00a7usion of new innovations.

This project was initiated by Jean (Jenny)Lanjouw. Tragically, Jenny died in late 2005, but had asked us to complete the project. This took muchlonger than expected because it involved complete reconstruction of the data set and empirical work. Itis essentially a new paper in its current form, but it remains an important part of Jenny\u00eds legacy and atopic to which she devoted much of her intellectual and policy e\u00a7orts. We hope she would be satis\u00d6edwith our work which, for us, was a labor of love.

As we will show, this is notexceptional\u00f3long launch lags are common and nearly 40 percent of all new drugs are onlylaunched in ten or fewer countries. Since delayed launch means foregone health bene\u00d6ts, it isimportant to understand how public policy a\u00a7ects the di\u00a7usion of new drug innovations. Inthis paper we demonstrate that the patent and price regulation policies governments adopthave a powerful impact on the speed at which new drugs become available in di\u00a7erentcountries.Promoting a\u00a7ordable access to new drugs is a central objective of government policy.There are two distinct challenges in achieving this: how to provide adequate incentives forthe development of new drugs, and how to ensure a\u00a7ordable prices of drugs once they aredeveloped. Governments use two main instruments to achieve these goals: patents and priceregulation. It is well known that there is a tension between these objectives. The innovationliterature emphasizes the basic tradeo\u00a7 between the dynamic gains from stronger incentivesto develop new technology provided by patents and the static welfare loss created by theresulting higher prices.1Much of the policy debate around patents and \u00ecaccess\u00ee to newmedicines has focused on pricing\u00f3the potential for patent-protected products to leave largenumbers of patients priced out the market in countries with limited private health insuranceand poorly funded public health systems. As many poorer countries have been required toprovide patent protection for pharmaceutical products under the 1994 TRIPS Agreement,patent policy has largely been evaluated in terms of the static welfare loss associated withhigher prices in emerging markets (Chaudhuri, Goldberg and Gia, 2006; Duggan and Goyal,2012; Kyle and Qian, 2013).2In the debates over the TRIPS Agreement (and more recently, the proposed Transpaci\u00d6cPartnership trade agreement), developing countries and public health advocacy groups ar-gued that harmonization of patent policy was both unnecessary and harmful when viewed1The classic statement of the tradeo\u00a7 is Arrow (1962), which spawned a huge literature. Empiricalstudies of the impact of patent rights on the rate and direction of innovation are more recent, and includeBranstetter and Sakakibara (2001), Moser (2005), Qian (2007), Kyle and McGahan (2012), Williams (2013),Galasso and Schankerman (2013), and Budish, Roin and Williams (2014).2TRIPS is the acronym for the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,which is administered by the World Trade Organization. For discussion of the political economy of TRIPSand other international trade-related agreements, see Sell (2006). Grossman and Lai (2004) provide atheoretical analysis of patent regimes in a trading world economy with di\u00a7erent market sizes and capacityfor innovation; also see related work by Scotchmer (2004) There have also been studies of how pricediscrimination in pharmaceuticals can help improve global welfare while also preserving innovation incentives(e.g., Jack and Lanjouw, 2005).1from the perspective of this tradeo\u00a7.3For low income countries, the welfare loss frompatents involves not just the traditional static e\u00a2ciency cost from prices above marginalcost, but also the worrying prospect that large segments of the population may have noa\u00a7ordable access to new drug therapies. This has led economists to recommend alternativeways for governments to provide innovation incentives while maintaining low prices in de-veloping countries, especially for vaccines.4Moreover, the increase in innovation incentivesfrom having patent rights in low income countries is likely to be small for many kinds ofdrugs because these countries do not account for a large part of the global market.5However, this debate misses a critical element: the impact patent rights and other policieshave on the di\u00a7usion of new drugs. The public health bene\u00d6ts of new drugs depend, \u00d6rst,on how quickly drugs are launched in the \u00eblocal\u00ed markets in di\u00a7erent countries and, second,on how widely they are adopted within a country, once they have been launched. Once adrug has been discovered, the sunk R&D costs are not relevant to the decision to launchin di\u00a7erent countries. However, the decision to launch in a country, and to develop themarketing and distribution infrastructure required to promote within-country adoption,will be sensitive to drug manufacturers\u00ed assessment of anticipated pro\u00d6ts relative to thesecountry-speci\u00d6c costs. Of course, if these costs were negligible, both aspects of di\u00a7usionwould be driven by demand side factors\u00f3i.e., heterogeneity in the pro\u00d6tability of adoption indi\u00a7erent countries. This is the perspective that has been most emphasized in the economicsliterature on di\u00a7usion, beginning with the seminal work of Griliches (1957). But di\u00a7usionalso has a supply side\u00f3sunk investments required to enter new markets, set up distributionchannels and inform potential customers about new products. If launch costs are su\u00a2cientlylarge, the di\u00a7usion of new technologies will be signi\u00d6cantly in\u00e1uenced by policies that a\u00a7ectpro\u00d6tability in di\u00a7erent markets. This supply-side perspective is at the heart of economicmodels of entry (e.g., Bresnahan and Reiss, 1988; Holmes, 2011; Collard-Wexler, 2013),and has been under-appreciated as a factor limiting di\u00a7usion of innovations across di\u00a7erentmarkets.Of course, the potential importance of patent rights in promoting global di\u00a7usion of inno-vation is not limited to pharmaceuticals. However, drugs are a good example to study both3For example, see \u00ecUSTR\u00eds proposal for the Intellectual Property Chapter of the Trans-Paci\u00d6c Partner-ship (TPP) will endanger access to medicines for all,\u00ee Public Citizen et al. (February 12, 2014), availableat http://www.citizen.org/statements-of-support4These include auctions (Kremer, 1998) and bulk purchasing with free distribution (Kremer, 2002;Kremer and Glennester, 2004). For a good discussion of non-patent incentive mechanisms, see Scotchmer(2004).5An important exception to this are drugs for \"neglected diseases\" whose burden falls disproportionatelyon the population of low-income countries. With little or no market for these drugs in high-income coun-tries, the strength of intellectual property rights in emerging markets could play a larger role in innovationincentives (Cockburn and Lanjouw, 2005). Again, patents are not the only way to provide incentives todo R&D in these areas, see e.g. Ridley, Grabowski and Moe (2006) who proposed the transferable PriorityReview Voucher mechanism now implemented in the USA.2because of their economic importance and because there are signi\u00d6cant, country-speci\u00d6ccosts of launching new drugs.6These include the costs of conducting additional clinicaltrials to meet local requirements, obtaining regulatory approval, setting up local distribu-tion and marketing networks, and educating healthcare providers. These \u00d6xed costs mustbe incurred in every country in which a drug is launched: outside tightly integrated trad-ing blocs such as the European Union, there are few international protocols that recognizeregulatory approval of drugs across borders, and limited economies of geographic scope inmarketing and distribution. Moreover, the bulk of these entry costs apply whether or notthe \u00d6rst entrant in a country is the original innovator of the drug, its licensee or a genericimitator.Existing studies on the relationship between intellectual property rights and the spreadof new technologies have focused on two main channels, international trade and technologytransfer by multinational companies. In particular, two recent papers identify these impactsby exploiting the strengthening of IP rights, mostly associated with the TRIPS Agreement.Delgado, Kyle and McGahan (2013) show that the timing of implementation of TRIPS(the compliance date varied across countries) is associated with increased trade \u00e1ows insectors that are IP-intensive relative to a control group. They \u00d6nd that the impact variessubstantially across sectors, and notably was larger in the information and communicationtechnology sector than in biopharmaceuticals, where compliance was subject to more excep-tions and complementary resources in distribution play a large role. Branstetter, Fishmanand Foley (2006) use \u00d6rm-level data to show that royalty payments and R&D expendituresby multinational a\u00a2liates increase after IP reforms were adopted in sixteen countries (somebefore TRIPS) and that this e\u00a7ect is concentrated among a\u00a2liates of parent companiesthat use U.S. patents extensively prior to the reforms. In both of these papers, the patentreforms are treated as exogenous events.There are two main related studies of cross-country di\u00a7usion of pharmaceuticals. Kyle(2007) uses a large data set on new molecules launched in OECD countries from 1980-2000, and shows that price regulation signi\u00d6cantly retards launches and, interestingly, that\u00d6rms are less likely to follow launch in a low-price country with launch in a high-pricecountry (possibly due to \u00ebreference pricing\u00ed policies by drug price regulators). However,the paper does not examine the impact of patent rights on drug launch dates, as there isnot much variation among OECD countries. In related research, Kyle (2006) analyzes asimilar sample of drug launches in the smaller set of G7 countries, focusing on how \u00d6rm6Al a u n c hd e c i s i o ni no n ec o u n t r ym a yd e p e n do np o l i c yr e g i m e si no t h e rc o u n t r i e s .

In this paper we focus on how domestic policies a\u00a7ectlaunch lags, but do not incorporate these policy externalities. A full treatment of dynamic entry decisionsacross markets with spillover e\u00a7ects remains an important topic for future research.3characteristics a\u00a7ect launch timing (possibly because they are correlated with unobservedentry costs).7In this paper we study how both patent regimes and price regulation, as well as economicfactors such as market size and demographics, a\u00a7ect the speed and geographic extent ofdi\u00a7usion of new pharmaceutical products across countries. The empirical analysis is basedon a large data set that covers launches of 642 new drugs in up to 76 countries duringthe period 1983-2002, together with information on the nature and evolution of patent andprice regulation regimes in these countries. Importantly, the countries in the data set spanall levels of economic development, exhibit a wide variety of patent regimes, and changedimportant aspects of patent policy with respect to pharmaceuticals over time.In the analysis we distinguish between two types of patent rights: those that protect ofmethods of manufacture (\u00ebprocess patents\u00ed) and those that protect pharmaceutical products(\u00ebproduct patents\u00ed). Process patents are considered relatively weak, as they do not preventcost-based competitive entry by entrants with superior manufacturing processes. Indeed,some countries (such as India) purposefully adopted a \u00ecprocess-only\u00ee patent regime forpharmaceutical innovations in order to foster a domestic industry based on inventing aroundoriginators\u00ed manufacturing processes. Product patents are typically considered strongerrights, blocking entry by competitive (or generic) products and allowing for more e\u00a7ectiveappropriation of rents. However, there is a wide variation across countries (and over timewithin countries) in both the duration and content of both process and product patents,which provides the potential for identifying the e\u00a7ects of regime choice on di\u00a7usion.There are four main empirical \u00d6ndings in the paper. First, we show that new drugsbecome available in many countries only after long lags (often more than 10 years) betweenthe date when a product in \u00d6rst launched commercially anywhere in the world (typically inthe US, Europe, or Japan) and its launch in other countries. Many new drugs are neverlaunched outside a handful of wealthier countries. Second, we demonstrate that the patentpolicies governments adopt strongly a\u00a7ect how quickly new drug therapies are launchedin their countries. Longer duration, and stronger, patent rights substantially speed updi\u00a7usion. These impacts are large and robust to a variety of empirical speci\u00d6cations. Forexample, controlling for economic and demographic factors, moving from a regime of noproduct patents to a long product patent term increases the per-period hazard of launch byabout 23 percent. Allowing for endogeneity of policy regimes using instrumental variablesincreases the magnitude of estimated e\u00a7ect to between 64 percent and 72 percent, dependingon the choice of instruments. This is equivalent to reducing launch lags by about 100percent. Short product patents have no e\u00a7ect. Process patents also promote faster launch,7Other studies that use much smaller samples of drugs/countries include Danzon, Wang and Wang(2005), and Berndt, Blalock and Cockburn (2011).4but the impact is not as large as for product patents. Importantly, we \u00d6nd that these e\u00a7ectshold equally for low and middle income countries as for high income countries.Third, we show that countries that adopt strong pharmaceutical price regulation expe-rience signi\u00d6cantly longer launch lags for new drugs. We estimate that introducing priceregulation decreases the per-period hazard of launch by about 15 percent, which is equiv-alent to increasing launch lags by about 25 percent (when instrumented, 49 to 60 percentreduction in the hazard rate, equivalent to about a 80 percent to 100 percent increase inlaunch lags.) Fourth, we \u00d6nd that new drugs are launched much faster in countries thathave health policy institutions that promote availability and distribution of drugs\u00f3in par-ticular, adopting the Essential Drug List of the World Health Organization and having aNational Formulary\u00f3and these institutions do not appear to be simply a proxy for unob-served institutional quality.Finally, we \u00d6nd that local market size, as captured by population, per capita income,health expenditures, and demographic factors in\u00e1uencing drug use) has a big impact onthe speed of drug launches. These results are consistent with earlier studies of U.S. datashowing that market size is related to both higher levels of pharmaceutical innovation andnon-generic entry (e.g., Scott-Morton, 1999; 2011).All of these key \u00d6ndings are robust to using a variety of instrumental variables, basedprimarily on a country\u00eds political and legal institutions, to address potential concern aboutendogeneity of policy regimes. In fact, the estimated impacts of price regulation and patentpolicy using instruments (in a full information maximum likelihood framework) are, asindicated above, higher than those in the baseline speci\u00d6cations of the hazard model.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops a simple dynamic model of druglaunches, as a framework for interpreting our empirical results. In Section 3 we describe thedata set (details are provided in the Data Appendix). Section 4 presents non-parametricevidence on the geographic and temporal di\u00a7usion of new drugs, and how it varies with theeconomic development and patent and price regulation regimes. We describe the speci\u00d6ca-tion of the hazard model of drug launches in Section 5.1 and the main econometric resultsin Section 5.2. In Section 6 we present robustness analysis. In Section 7 we show that theresults are robust to using instruments to address the endogeneity of policy regimes. Section8 uses our parameter estimates to simulate the impact of counterfactual policy regimes ondrug di\u00a7usion. In the conclusion we summarize the key \u00d6ndings and directions for futureresearch.52A M o d e l o f D r u g L a u n c hConsider a \u00d6rm that has developed a new drugiwhich can be launched in a set of countries,denoted byj=1; :::; J:The \u00d6rm obtains a product patent on the drug in each country attimet=0:8Patent protection lasts forTjperiods in countryj.

International patentprotocols require that the inventor apply for protection in other countries within 18 months of the prioritydate, after which the right expires. As an empirical matter, the launch of new drugs often occurs much laterthan the patent application date. Our assumption that the drug is patented in all countries is made forsimplicity only.9The entry cost includes the cost of obtaining regulatory approval in the target country (there is nomechanism for multi-country regulatory review), investment in physical distribution channels, informationprovision to doctors and pharmacies, and securing registration on the national drug formulary. These costscan vary substantially both with the type of drug and the country of launch.10The random e\u00a7ects speci\u00d6cation implies thatE(!ijt!i0jt)=2andE(!ijt!ij0t)=2fori6=i0andj6=j0:6where2(0;1)is the discount rate.

Details of the proceduresand sources are provided in the Data Appendix.Identifying drug launchesA launch is de\u00d6ned as the \u00d6rst appearance of the identi\u00d6ed molecule (new chemicalentity) in a given country, whether in proprietary or generic form. Determining if, andwhen, a new drug becomes available in a given country is not straightforward. Since almostall countries require formal approval from a health and safety regulator before a drug canbe marketed, administrative records could potentially be used for this purpose. But poorrecord keeping in some countries, lack of easily accessible public records, and languagebarriers make it infeasible to track regulatory approvals for large numbers of drugs acrossmany countries, particularly for historical data. Regulatory approvals also do not directlytrack commercial availability (formal approval is not the same as de facto launch of aproduct).We rely on a compilation of product launches obtained from a commercial market re-search company, IMS Health Inc. This database tracks product launches in all therapeuticclasses in up to 76 di\u00a7erent countries from 1983-2002. Product launches were identi\u00d6ed byIMS from a variety of sources, including regulatory approvals, announcements by manufac-turers, local media reports, and IMS\u00ed active surveillance of distribution channels as partof other data gathering e\u00a7orts. Because India was not covered by IMS during this period,we supplement this data source with information from an Indian market research company,ORG/MARG, that tracked product launches in a limited set of therapeutic over the sameperiod.To track launches accurately, drugs must be unambiguously identi\u00d6ed across countries.Unfortunately there is considerable variation across time and over countries in how a given8chemical entity is named.11Failing to recognize equivalent chemical entities will result inover-counting of new products, under-counting of the number of countries in which a givendrug is launched, and inaccurate dating of launches. As detailed in the Data Appendix, ittook considerable e\u00a7ort to track the history of drug launches in these data due to changes incountry coverage, and di\u00a2culties in consistently identifying drugs due to variations in prod-uct names. The source dataset contains more than 180,000 observations on product-countrylaunches. These products contained approximately 9,600 distinct active drug ingredients inuse around the world during the sample period, for which we compiled more than 250,000synonyms from a variety of reference sources. Of these 9,600 distinct active ingredients wefocus on 642 clearly identi\u00d6able chemical entities that were \u00d6rst introduced anywhere in theworld during this period, and then identify the date when they \u00d6rst appear in any productlaunched in each country. Several important choices were made in creating this datasetto minimize under-counting of launches. We excluded products in a variety of therapeuticclasses where it was particularly di\u00a2cult to identify active ingredients unambiguously.12Wealso used a relatively broad de\u00d6nition of what constitutes an equivalent chemical entity bygrouping together all of the salts and esters of a given \u00ebactive moiety\u00ed. This procedure mayignore clinically important di\u00a7erences among variants that would lead a pharmacologist todistinguish between di\u00a7erent products, but it makes our results conservative in the sensethat we may be over-counting launches of equivalent products. Because the country cover-age of the source data expanded over time (and \u00ebnew\u00ed countries appeared, such as the CzechRepublic and Slovakia) we were careful to account for left-censoring of launches (i.e. drugswere excluded from being \u00ebat risk\u00ed of launch in a country if their \u00d6rst worldwide launchoccurred prior to entry of the country into the dataset.)Patent and price control regimesFor each country in our sample, we characterize the domestic patent regime along fourdimensions: duration of patent term, coverage of pharmaceutical products, coverage ofchemical manufacturing processes, and an index of the strength of patent protection thatre\u00e1ects the degree to which patent law provisions favor patent holders versus potential in-fringers (Pro-patent Index,which varies from zero to one). The variables are constructedusing data from Ginarte and Park (1997), Park (2008) and other reference sources citedin the Data Appendix. These variables change slowly over time, and while there is consid-erable convergence towards the \u00ecTRIPS standard\u00ee (e.g., 20 year term, no exceptions forpharmaceutical products) by the end of the sample period, there was considerable variation11For example, the drug known as acetominophen in North America is known as paracetamol in mostother countries, and is sold under more than 50 di\u00a7erent brand names around the world.12These include product classes such as dermatologicals, where the boundary between prescription drugs,over-the-counter medicines and personal care products is particularly blurred, and vaccines and biologicswhere nomenclature was not well standardized during this period.9among countries during the 1980\u00eds and 1990\u00eds.We have no reason to believe that the relationship between patent term and the hazard ofdrug launch is linear. Rather than impose a functional form, we use three mutually exclusivedummy variables to capture patent term duration:Short=0<duration12 years (fromapplication date);Medium=13duration17andLong= duration18(the referencecategory is no patent protection).13Note that since the average period between patent appli-cation and marketing approval on a product is about 10 years (Grabowski and Kyle, 2007), aShortpatent conveys essentially no e\u00a7ective coverage to the patentee. We use two separatesets of these dummy variables, one for product patents (Short_Product, Medium_ProductandLong_Product) and another for process patents (Short_Process,Medium_ProcessandLong_Process). In terms of country/year observations, short, medium and long processpatents account for 10.8, 22.3 and 60.0 percent of the sample; for product patents the \u00d6g-ures are 6.4, 16.5 and 58.2 percent, respectively. We experimented with di\u00a7erent de\u00d6nitionsof the cuto\u00a7s these we discuss later, theeconometric results presented in Section 5 are generally robust to these alternatives.Countries approach the control of pharmaceutical prices in a bewildering variety ofways. We consider systems of explicit price regulation and summarize the variation acrosscountries with two dummy variables\u00f3one for the existence of \u00ecsome\u00ee price regulation andthe second for \u00ecextensive\u00ee price control. A price regime is labeled as \u00ecextensive\u00ee if all drugsare regulated, rather than just a subset of the market, or if a country\u00eds price regulation isidenti\u00d6ed by commentators as being particularly rigorous. The set of reports and legaltexts consulted in making this determination are given in Lanjouw (2005). In the sample,22 percent of country/year observations are coded as having no price controls, 31 percentwith some price regulation and 47 percent with extensive controls.14Pharmaceutical policy institutionsThe observed timing of market entry re\u00e1ects both the decisions of \u00d6rms and the ef-\u00d6ciency of a country\u00eds regulatory process. We capture government policies that promoteaccess to pharmaceuticals by coding three dummy variables for each country-year. The \u00d6rstis whether a country had adopted a national formulary, where listed drugs would be eligiblefor distribution through a publicly funded health system, typically more widely prescribed,13Where the patent term runs from date of grant rather than date of application, as was the case in e.g.the U.S. prior to 1995, we added two years to make the term roughly equivalent to one running from dateof application. Results were not sensitive to changing this assumption about the pendency period to threeyears.14Appendix Table 1 provides information, for each country in the sample, on the number of years ofcoverage, number of drugs launched, average percentage of drugs launched within 5 years of their initiallaunch date anywhere, and the product patent, process patent, and price regulation regimes and theirchanges over time.10and with payment mechanisms in place. The second is whether a country had adopted theEssential Drug List (EDL) promulgated by the World Health Organization, which indicatesthat a country\u00eds health institutions are oriented towards promoting access to basic drugs.The third is whether a country has a formal \u00ecnational drug policy,\u00ee i.e. an e\u00a7ort to co-ordinate industrial policy and domestic regulation to promote access to safe and e\u00a7ectivepharmaceuticals. At the start of our sample period, 65 percent of countries had a nationalformulary, 41 percent had adopted the EDL and 63 percent had issued a national drugpolicy; by 1997 all countries had adopted all three.Demographic and Income VariablesWe use a set of income and demographic variables to control for variations in the po-tential demand for pharmaceuticals. These include: population size and the fraction ofpopulation over 65 years old, real GDP per capita in purchasing power parity terms, in-come inequality measured by the Gini coe\u00a2cient, and health care expenditures as a percentof GDP. We also include measures of the quality of regulatory bureaucracy and the rule oflaw, both taken from the World Bank.Many of the explanatory variables are available annually, but others only in one orseveral cross-sections (details in the Data Appendix). Table 1 presents summary statisticsfor the variables used in the econometric analysis.4D r u g D i \u00a7 u s i o n : N o n - p a r a m e t r i c E v i d e n c eWe begin with some non-parametric evidence on the pattern of global drug di\u00a7usion. Table2 presents information on the geographic span of drug launches, and shows the distributionof the number of countries for which a launch was observed for each drug in the sample.Recognizing that this tabulation does not account for right-censoring (some drugs mayhave launched in some countries after the sample period ends), these statistics illustratethe dominant, and striking, feature of this measure of di\u00a7usion: how limited it is. In theentire sample of new drugs, 39 percent were launched in ten or fewer countries, and only 41percent were launched in more than 25 countries. The mean number of countries in whicha drug was launched is 22.4 (median of 18) out of a possible 76. The fact that drugs arenot launched more widely can be due to various factors: the limited size and demographicfeatures of markets, and the availability of substitutes, may limit anticipated demand to alevel that does not justify the cost of entry; di\u00a7erences in disease patterns across countries;and rejection by some local regulatory authorities. Even among the wealthier countrieswith most developed health care systems, not all of these drugs became available during thesample period: the USA, Germany, and the UK, for example, saw launches of only about60 percent of the sample of drugs. The limited availability of new drugs (at least by this11measure) suggests a substantial welfare loss. The good news from a welfare perspective isthat the geographic di\u00a7usion is substantially wider for the (arguably) higher quality drugs\u00f3as proxied by those obtaining approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, whichis among the most stringent regulatory agencies in the world (column 3), and the subset ofFDA-approved drugs that pass a priority review screening (column 4).15For these drugs,more than half are eventually launched in more than 25 countries (though with long lags,as we will see later). But even among these high quality new drugs, 13 percent were onlylaunched in three or less countries within the sample period.Because launch lags (the time elapsed between \u00d6rst worldwide launch and launch ina given country) can be long and the sample is truncated at 2002, Table 2 likely under-represents the true extent of di\u00a7usion. To examine the temporal aspects of di\u00a7usion, andto address this potential undercounting of launches, in Table 3 and Figures 1 through4 we present results from nonparametric analyses of time-until-launch that estimate thedistribution of launch lags allowing for right-censoring. Figures plot the Kaplan-Meier\u00ebfailure\u00ed function (i.e.,1^Stwhere^Stis the estimated survival function) while the tablereports only the time corresponding to the 25th percentile of launch lags. A number of\u00d6ndings stand out. First, as shown in Figure 1, even after 10 years, only 41 percent of drug-country opportunities for a launch were taken up. Even after 20 years or more, less than 50percent of possible launches had taken place, and as practical matter, many of these drugsmay never be launched in large numbers of countries. While not all of the country-yearsin which a drug was not launched necessarily represent welfare losses (some drugs mayhave become obsoleted by advances in technology, may have no value in contexts whereimportant complementary technologies or resources for health care are not available, ormay only be useful for treating diseases with very low incidence in a country), this evidenceof limited di\u00a7usion is nonetheless very disappointing from a welfare perspective. Evenin the subsample of FDA-approved drugs, only 54 percent were launched in the averagecountry within 10 years. (Di\u00a7usion of non-FDA-approved drugs was much slower and lessextensive, with 19 percent of drug-country launch opportunities \u00d6lled within 10 years.)Second, delays in launching drugs are strongly related to per capita income. Measuredin terms of the estimated time for 25 percent of possible drug-country launches to takeplace, the \u00d6rst panel of Table 3 shows that the di\u00a7usion pattern is strongly related tomarket size, as proxied by the level of GDP per capita. (In the regressions that follow, wewill also control for population size). As shown in the \u00d6rst column, it takes nine years for25 percent of drugs to be launched in the average low income country, but only two yearsin high income countries. This income-related disparity persists when we focus only on15Of the 642 drugs in the sample, 66% were approved by the FDA, and 41% of which (27% of the fullsample) were priority-reviewed by the FDA. While we focus on di\u00a7usion lags, there is also evidence thatFDA approval times are shorter for more important drugs (Dranove and Meltzer, 1994).12the higher quality drugs (second and third columns of Table 3). The full distribution ofestimated launch lags broken out by countries\u00ed income level is given in Figure 2. (Mediumincome includes both the lower middle and upper middle income categories of the WorldBank.)Third, the pace and extent of di\u00a7usion is strongly associated with a country\u00eds patentand price regulation regimes. In the second panel of Table 3 and in Figure 3 we show resultsbroken out by a summary measure of each country\u00eds patent regime. The duration of patentrights is categorized as None, Short, Medium and Long (recall that we de\u00d6ne Short as apatent term of 10 years or less, Medium as 11 to 16 years and Long as 17 years or longer)and a country/year observation is assigned to that category if it had either process and/orproduct patents in that group. With no patents, the estimated time for 25 percent of drug-country launch opportunities to be \u00d6lled is eight years, falling to less than 2.6 years withlong-duration patents. In the third panel of Table 3 and in Figure 4 we group observationswhere there was either no or weak price regulation versus strong.16In countries with noor weak price regulation, the equivalent statistic is three years, rising to \u00d6ve where priceregulation is strong. The estimated \u00ebfailure\u00ed functions plotted in Figures 3 and 4 are verydi\u00a7erent across categories, and the log-rank test for homogeneity strongly rejects the nullof no di\u00a7erence categories:2(3) = 750for patent regimes, and2(2) = 267for pricecontrols.5E m p i r i c a l M o d e l a n d R e s u l t s5.1 Econometric Speci\u00d6cationTo analyze the timing of drug launches more formally, and control for other covariates,we use a parametric hazard model. A launch is de\u00d6ned as the \u00d6rst appearance of theidenti\u00d6ed molecule (new chemical entity) in a given country, whether in proprietary orgeneric form. The launch lag in a country is dated relative to the \u00d6rst global launch of themolecule (measured in days). We adopt the proportional hazard model with the Weibulldistribution. The hazard of launch for drugiin countryjat timetcan be expressed ash(tjxij(t)) and the scalar>0and vectorareparameters to be estimated. This speci\u00d6cation imposes a monotone hazard rate, but it canbe either increasing(>1) or decreasing(<1)over time. The model of drug launch in16In regressions of the type discussed below we found no statistically discernible distinction between weakprice controls and no price controls.13Section 2 predicts that the hazard rate declines witht:since the remaining patent durationfalls witht;the threshold pro\u00d6tability shock required for launch must be larger to generaterents to cover the entry cost. The parameter estimates ofpresented below con\u00d6rm thisprediction.17For continuous covariates, the parameterlreported in the tables correspondto the percentage change in the per period conditional probability (hazard) of launch dueto a unit change inxl(for discrete covariates, e.g., patent and price regulation regimes,lis the percentage change in moving from the reference category to the focal regime).18Equivalently, we can interpret the negative of the parameters (scaled by the estimate of)as the log change in the predicted time to launch.For any given drug the hazard of launch is likely to di\u00a7er across countries for reasonsother than a country\u00eds economic and demographic characteristics and policy regime, forexample if the incidence of the relevant disease varies across countries. We address thisin three ways. First, we include a set of 14 therapeutic class dummies (the \u00eb\u00d6rst level\u00edATC code assigned by the World Health Organization) in all regressions. This allows thebaseline hazard rate to be di\u00a7erent for each group of drugs. Second, in all regressions we usestandard errors clustered at the drug-country level. Finally, as one of the robustness checks,we allow for unobserved heterogeneity across drugs by including a random drug e\u00a7ect.5.2 Baseline ResultsTable 4 presents the maximum likelihood parameter estimates for various speci\u00d6cationsof the hazard model. In column (1) the control variables include elapsed time since \u00d6rstglobal launch, the set of patent and price control policy dummies, population and per capitaincome to control for market size, a dummy variable for whether the drug was approved bythe FDA (as an indicator of drug quality), and a set of therapeutic class dummies. Note\u00d6rst that the estimate of the Weibull ancillary parameter,, is 0.614, which is statisticallydi\u00a7erent from one and con\u00d6rms a declining hazard of launch, consistent with the theoreticalmodel. This estimate is stable across speci\u00d6cations.Second, as expected, we \u00d6nd that a larger population and higher GDP per capita in-17We also experimented with a log-logistic model that is more \u00e1exible in that it can generate a distributionwith a non-monotonic hazard rate. The parameter estimates from that speci\u00d6cation indicated that thehazard declines over time after a few weeks. This is interesting because it suggests that, unlike in most ofthe literature on the di\u00a7usion of innovations, learning about the potential pro\u00d6tability of markets does notappear to be an important factor for the global di\u00a7usion of drugs \u00f1 if this were the case then we should seean a hazard rate that increases with time since \u00d6rst worldwide launch.18With time varying covariates, the hazard function at timetmust be de\u00d6ned conditional on the entiresequence of covariates up tot;call itXij(t)=fxij(s):stg:Thus the marginal impact of a covariate onthe survival probability and hence the launch lag will depend on the sequenceXij(t):In our later discussionof how covariates a\u00a7ect predicted launch lags, we focus on the coe\u00a2cients:One can also use the estimatedcoe\u00a2cients to compute the marginal e\u00a7ect of covariates on the launch lag for each drug-country pair, andthen average these marginal e\u00a7ects over pairs using their speci\u00d6c sequenceXij(t):We do not do that here.14crease the hazard of launch. This \u00d6nding that market size is an important determinantof drug di\u00a7usion is consistent with previous studies that document the role of market sizeon pharmaceutical innovation and entry (see the Introduction for relevant citations). Theelasticities of the per period hazard of launch with respect to population and per capitaincome are 0.074 and 0.247. In terms of their e\u00a7ect on launch lags, these are equivalentto elasticities of about -0.12 and -0.40, respectively. Third, the coe\u00a2cient on the dummyfor FDA-approved drugs con\u00d6rms that these high quality drugs are launched much faster\u00f3their per period hazard of launch is more than double that of low quality drugs, and theirpredicted time to launch is less than one half of the lag for low quality drugs.Finally, thereare signi\u00d6cant di\u00a7erences in the speed of drug di\u00a7usion across therapeutic classes. Coef-\u00d6cients on the therapeutic class dummies (not reported in the table) range from -0.81 to0.26, equivalent to launch lags over 130 percent faster or almost 60 percent slower than thereference category, and we strongly reject the hypothesis that the coe\u00a2cients on therapeuticclass dummies are jointly zero (p-value<0.001). This holds for all speci\u00d6cations.Turning to the key policy variables, the \u00d6rst important \u00d6nding is that extensive pricecontrols signi\u00d6cantly delay drug di\u00a7usion.19Having strong price regulation reduces thehazard of launch by 15 percent, equivalent to 25 percent increase in the predicted launchlag.20In addition, both process and product patents have a large e\u00a7ect on launch lags. Ininterpreting these coe\u00a2cients, it is important to recognize that these dummies are mutuallyexclusive within process and within product, but not across product and process. Thuswhile the estimated coe\u00a2cient onShort_Processimplies that relative to having no patentprotection, a short process patent regime\u00f3such as that used by India between 1971 and2005\u00f3reduces launch lags by 19 percent, moving toMedium_Processgives an incremen-tal gain of 13 percent. The coe\u00a2cient onLong_Processis smaller (and not signi\u00d6cant),suggesting that long process patents may undermine vibrant process-related innovation asan avenue for entry by indigenous \u00d6rms (but caution is warranted, as we later show thatLong_Processis signi\u00d6cant when we use instrumental variables to account for endogeneityof policy regimes). It should also be noted that the coe\u00a2cient onShort_Processis identi\u00d6edo\u00a7 a relatively small number of observations: only a handful of countries in the sample hadthis type of patent regime, and some for only limited periods of time, and it is possiblethat the estimated e\u00a7ect is confounded with other (unobserved) aspects of their internal19Of course, \u00d6rms can adopt strategies to forestall price regulation or mitigate its e\u00a7ects. An interestingexample of this is the study by Ellison and Wolfram (2004), which shows that drug \u00d6rms acted to limit priceincreases during a period of intensive political discussion of health care reform in the U.S.20We also tried using two separate dummy variables for weak and strong price regulation in a variety ofspeci\u00d6cations not reported here. We consistently found that weak controls have no statistically signi\u00d6cante\u00a7ect on launch lags. Therefore, in all speci\u00d6cations reported in the paper we use only one dummy variablefor strong regulation, and combine country/year observations with weak and no controls as the referencegroup.15market. One of these countries was India, which may be a special case in terms of the size ofits internal market and success in developing a highly competitive export-oriented genericsector during this period.The parameters also show that long product patents have a powerful e\u00a7ect on di\u00a7u-sion. Short product patents,Short_Product(10 years), and medium product patents,Medium_Product, do not have strongly signi\u00d6cant e\u00a7ects relative to no patent protection,which is what would be expected given the long development and regulatory lags (and thefact that patents are taken out very early in the R&D process to ensure priority). However,long product patents (Long_Product) reduce launch lags by 55 percent.21In addition topatent term, the content of patent protection also matters for di\u00a7usion. The point estimateof thePro-patent Indexis statistically signi\u00d6cant and implies that a one standard deviationincrease in the index reduces predicted launch lags by about 11.3 percent.22It is also worth pointing out that patent rights can a\u00a7ect the direction, as well as thespeed, of drug di\u00a7usion. Strong patent rights may be particularly important for inducinglaunch of drugs that are only useful for treating smaller patient populations. Non-patentadvantages over competitors (e.g., market frictions, \u00d6rst mover advantages etc.) may besu\u00a2cient for \u00d6rst entrants to recover \u00d6xed costs of entry for blockbuster drugs, but this willtypically not be the case for other types of drugs.In column (2) we examine how health expenditures, in addition to the overall levelof purchasing power, a\u00a7ect the incentives to launch in a country. To do this, we includeboth the logs of GDP per capita and the percentage of GDP that is devoted to healthexpenditures. This sharply reduces the impact of GDP per capita (the implied elasticityon launch lags falls from -0.40 to -0.04), but the e\u00a7ect is picked up by health expenditures(elasticity on launch lags of -0.51). Adding the two coe\u00a2cients, the implied elasticity ofthe time to launch with respect to health expenditures per capita is -0.55. The coe\u00a2cientson the process and product patent regimes are generally robust, except for thePro-patentIndexwhere the coe\u00a2cient declines by half, and the coe\u00a2cients onShort_ProductandMedium_Product, whereShort_Productbecomes much smaller and statistically insigni\u00d6-cant andMedium_Productincreases to about one half the magnitude ofLong_Productand21Taken at face value, this regression speci\u00d6cation would also imply that the product and process e\u00a7ectsare additive: e.g., a country withMedium_ProcessandLong_Productwould have 32.4 + 54.5 =95% lowerlaunch lags. In fact, since the patent terms likely overlap substantial, the actual period of market exclusivityfor the patent holder will be close to the longer of the patent terms, and the impact on launch lags is betterestimated by the largest of the two coe\u00a2cients rather than their sum.22As indicated in Section 3, we tried using di\u00a7erent de\u00d6nitions of the patent term for both process andproduct patents. The parameter estimates are similar to those reported in Table 4. The only notabledi\u00a7erences occur when we de\u00d6ne long patents as17 years (rather than the baseline de\u00d6nition18). Inthat case, the point estimates of the coe\u00a2cients onMedium_ProcessandLong_Productdecline by aboutat h i r d( t h o u g ht h ed i \u00a7 e r e n c e sa r en o ts t a t i s t i c a l l ys i g n i \u00d6 c a n t ) ,a n dt h ec o e \u00a2 c i e n to nLong_Processis nowpositive and statistically signi\u00d6cant.16becomes strongly signi\u00d6cant. (These coe\u00a2cients are stable across the all the speci\u00d6cationsthat control for health expenditures.)Column (3) expands the set of control variables to include the Gini index of incomeinequality, the fraction of elderly in the population (another dimension of e\u00a7ective marketsize), and three health policy \u00ebinstitutions\u00ed. The \u00d6rst, and most important, observationis that the estimated coe\u00a2cients on the price regulation and patent regime variables arerobust to adding these new controls. Second, drugs are launched faster in countries withmore elderly in the population, and the implied impact is large\u00f3a standard deviationincrease in the fraction of population over age 65 reduces launch lags by 21 percent. Third,we \u00d6nd that, for a given level of GDP per capita, the distribution of income is a signi\u00d6cantdeterminant of market entry. Greater incomeinequality(higher Gini) increases the speedof di\u00a7usion signi\u00d6cantly\u00f3the coe\u00a2cient implies that a standard deviation rise in the Giniindex reduces launch lags by 23 percent. The likely reason is that greater inequality makesit more likely that there are at least some elements in the population (the \u00ebwealthy elite\u00ed)that can a\u00a7ord to buy the drugs.23Next we use dummy controls for three health policy institutions\u00f3whether the countryhas a national formulary, an essential drug list, and a national drug policy. The essentialdrug list and national formulary play two roles. They facilitate the distribution of drugs tothe population, which should increase e\u00a7ective market size and thus promote earlier druglaunches. At the same time, they signal more e\u00a7ective institutions for implementing anyprice control regimes that may be in place, which would reduce incentives to launch. Theirimpact is thus an empirical question. We \u00d6nd that these health institutions have a large andstatistically signi\u00d6cant impact on the speed of drug di\u00a7usion. The point estimates implythat the predicted time to launch is 31 percent lower in countries that have adopted theEssential Drug List,24and an additional 16 percent lower if they have a national formularyin place. We \u00d6nd no signi\u00d6cant e\u00a7ect of having a formal national drug policy which may notbe surprising since, while it signals policy intent, it is a less concrete manifestation than theother two institutions.25Unfortunately, it is not possible with the available data to unbundle23While this may be true in countries with relatively low levels of per capita income, one might thinkthat inequality could have a smaller, or perhaps even an opposite, e\u00a7ect in higher income countries (whereless inequality might empower more consumers to be able to a\u00a7ord new drugs). When we drop high incomecountries from the sample and re-estimate the model (reported later), we still \u00d6nd that inequality reduceslaunch lags, but the coe\u00a2cient is only half as large. This is consistent with the idea that there is a thresholdlevel of income that makes an individual a potential consumer of new drugs, and the e\u00a7ect of inequality onthe demand for drugs depends on the distribution of income around that threshold.24This isnotthe e\u00a7ect on launch times for drugs which are listed on the EDL. While it would beinteresting to look at the di\u00a7usion rate speci\u00d6cally for EDL-listed drugs, there were too few additions to theEDL during the sample period to do this reliably.25Of course, these variables may also serve as proxies for broader institutional quality in the country,though we also include an index of the rule of law (from the World Bank) in this, and all subsequent,regressions. Its estimated coe\u00a2cient is never statistically signi\u00d6cant, however.17these institutions and identify the speci\u00d6c features that make entry more attractive. This isan important challenge but it requires more detail about the how these institutions actuallyfunction in di\u00a7erent countries.Finally, it may be important to recognize that the quality of regulatory agencies variesacross countries. If this is correlated with the choice of policy regimes, we might misattributethe impact of such policies on the timing of drug launches. To address this concern, incolumn (4) we include a measure of bureaucratic quality for each country/year observation,taken from the World Bank. We expect countries with higher quality regulators to screenmore carefully, and this should generate longer launch lags on average. However, the impactof better screening should depend on the quality of the drug\u00f3more e\u00a7ective regulators aremore likely to block, or delay, low quality drugs. To test this idea, we interact the measureof bureaucratic quality with dummy variables for whether the drug was approved by theFDA (BQ_FDAandBQ_nonFDA). When we do this, the estimated coe\u00a2cients on thedemographic and policy variables remain stable. The new \u00d6nding is that higher qualitybureaucracy is associated with longer launch lags for all drugs but, as expected, the e\u00a7ect isan order of magnitude larger for low quality drugs than for those approved by the FDA, andboth are statistically signi\u00d6cant. The parameter estimates imply that a standard deviationincrease in bureaucratic quality increases launch lags by three percent for FDA-approveddrugs, but by almost 50 percent for low quality drugs.6R o b u s t n e s s A n a l y s i sIn this section we check the robustness of the main results to a variety of di\u00a7erent speci\u00d6-cations. In each case, we introduce the changes relative to the baseline speci\u00d6cation givenin column (4) of Table 4.First, in column (1) of Table 5 we introduce random drug e\u00a7ects, to allow for unobserveddrug-speci\u00d6c variation such as a drug\u00eds potential market size (i.e., di\u00a7erence in the incidenceof the targeted diseases or conditions) or di\u00a7erences in the di\u00a2culty and cost of obtainingregulatory approval. These random e\u00a7ects enter as a multiplicative factor in the modelfor the hazard function, and are assumed to follow a Gamma distribution (this standardformulation yields a convenient analytical expression for the likelihood function). Overall,the results are similar to (and not statistically di\u00a7erent from) the estimates of the baselinespeci\u00d6cation.Second, we re-estimated the baseline regression using a more disaggregated classi\u00d6ca-tion of therapeutic categories. This uses 61 rather than 14 therapeutic classes, based onthe second level of the World Health Organization ATC classi\u00d6cation (for example, \u00ebanti-hypertensives\u00ed as opposed to \u00ebcardiovascular system\u00ed). The results, given in column (2), are18very close to the baseline speci\u00d6cation.Third, we examine whether our previous results for the pooled sample of drugs alsohold when the model is estimated using data only for (arguably) higher quality drugs, asrepresented by those that were approved by the FDA in the U.S. Since high quality drugsare especially important for public health, it is critical to know how policy choices a\u00a7ecttheir di\u00a7usion. In addition, idiosyncratic regulatory requirements on safety and e\u00a2cacy maymake it possible for drugs to be approved in one country but then fail to reach other marketsbecause they do not meet the local regulatory standards. As a consequence, an observedfailure to launch may be driven by variation in the regulatory environment, rather than bythe pro\u00d6tability calculations as modeled in Section 2. Focusing on drugs approved by theFDA, one of the world\u00eds most stringent regulatory authorities, helps rule this out\u00f3albeitwithout addressing problems such as a drug failing to launch because a country requiresthat clinical trials be conducted on its own residents before approving a drug and these aretoo costly relative to anticipated pro\u00d6ts. The results are presented in column (3). All ofour main \u00d6ndings hold up, and the point estimates are very close to the estimates fromthe baseline speci\u00d6cation for both price regulation and patent policy regimes, as well as theother covariates.Fourth, we consider di\u00a7erences between high income and developing countries. Histori-cally there has been much less variation in patent regimes in high-income countries than indeveloping economies and there was (and remains) serious opposition to harmonization ofpatent policies under the TRIPS Agreement. Opponents of harmonization on a relativelylong-duration and broad-based patent standard asserted then (and now) that the e\u00a7ects ofpatent protection are likely to be more damaging for developing countries, both becausetheir capacity to innovate in drugs was lower (reducing any positive incentive e\u00a7ects frompatents) and because the deleterious price e\u00a7ects of patent protection could fatally under-mine the market for drugs in poorer countries. However, the important question of impactof patent rights on thedi\u00a7usionof drugs (as opposed to their pricing) has received littleattention in these debates. We examine this question in column (4) of Table 5, wherewe drop high income countries from the sample. It is striking that the qualitative results,and most of the point estimates\u00f3including the coe\u00a2cients on the policy regimes\u00f3are verysimilar to the baseline speci\u00d6cation where we use all countries. The main di\u00a7erences arethat the impact of population is smaller among lower/middle income countries, the pro-patent index is no longer signi\u00d6cant, and the relative magnitudes of the impact of EDL andnational formularies are reversed.Fifth, we extend the baseline speci\u00d6cation to allow for interactions between price regu-lation and patent policy regimes. There are reasons to expect the e\u00a7ect of patent regimesto depend on whether there is strong price regulation in place. In the extreme case where19price controls bring prices down to unit cost, patent protection would not provide any in-centive for launch. In less extreme cases, we would expect the incentives from patent rightsto be reduced. To investigate this, we interact the dummy for price regulation with thetwo extreme patent regimes,Short_ProcessandLong_Product.26The results in column(5) provide some evidence that price controls strongly dilute the incentive e\u00a7ects of patentprotection. In the absence of price regulation, the point estimates ofShort_ProcessandLong_Producton the launch hazard are both about 0.33 and highly signi\u00d6cant. Whenthere is strong price regulation, the impact ofShort_Processfalls essentially to zero (theestimate is -0.04, and the test on the sum of coe\u00a2cients does not reject the null of zero,p-value=0.63), while forLong_Productit declines by about 40 percent to 0.204 but is stillstrongly signi\u00d6cant (p-value<0.001). These results highlight the importance of taking theinteractions between policy instruments into account in designing overall policy strategy forpharmaceuticals.Finally, we investigate how indigenous innovative capacity a\u00a7ects the timing of druglaunches. A drug can be launched by the \u00d6rm that developed it, its licensee, or a domesticcompetitor (often, a generic drug company) in cases where the new molecule is not protectedby a product patent. To cover launch costs, the most common avenue for competitive entryby indigenous \u00d6rms is to innovate on the drug manufacturing process\u00f3typically involvingchemical engineering\u00f3and protect it with a process patent. Our data do not unambiguouslyidentify whether products are launched in a country by the product innovator, its licensee,or a competitor, so we cannot directly examine the role of competitive entry. Instead, weconstruct a proxy to capture local technical capacity to do process innovation, using thestock of patents in \u00d6elds related to chemical engineering and manufacturing in each coun-try/year, and test how this innovative capacity a\u00a7ect the timing of launches.27When weadd this control (column 6), the estimated parameters on the patent and price regulation(and other) variables are robust. This shows that the observed policy regimes are not sim-ply proxies for having a strong local R&D capability (which might in turn in\u00e1uence whichpolicies are adopted). The point estimate on the stock of chemical patents is positive andstatistically signi\u00d6cant, indicating that countries with greater local capacity for chemical26We also tried interacting price regulation withMedium_ProcessandMedium_Product,b u tt h e s et w opatent regimes are highly correlated in the sample (very few countries have long product patents without longprocess patents), and the results were not clear-cut. We do not interact price regulation withShort_ProductorLong_Processas neither of these variables entered signi\u00d6cantly in the baseline regression.27The measure is is a count of patents by application date (measured in 1000\u00eds of patents) in any of theinternational patent classes (IPC) corresponding to chemical engineering and manufacturing, as indexed bythe American Chemical Society (Data Appendix for details). The count is constructed for each country/year,based on the country of the inventor and cumulated into a stock using a 15 percent depreciation rate andan assumed pre-sample growth of 10 percent to initialize the stock. If a patent has multiple inventors listed,we count the patent in each of the listed countries. Results are very similar if we just use the patent \u00e1ow.We do not use logs because nearly 40 percent of the country/year observations are zero.20process innovation (and, presumably, therefore, local pharmaceutical manufacturing capac-ity) have somewhat faster drug launches. This points to a potentially important role forindigenous entry, and highlights the need for process patent protection in countries withlocal technical capacity (especially where product patent rights are absent or ine\u00a7ective).7E n d o g e n o u s P o l i c y R e g i m e sPatent and price control regimes are outcomes of a political process, which raises a concernabout endogeneity. The most likely source is unobserved heterogeneity across countries inpolitical institutions that a\u00a7ects both the choice of policy regime and the timing of newdrug launches\u00f3e.g., variation across countries in the pro\u00d6tability of markets, institutionalquality and policy enforcement.28For example, \u00d6rms have greater incentives to lobby forstrong patent rights where entry is more pro\u00d6table, which would cause us to over-estimatethe e\u00a7ect of patent rights on the timing of drug launches. But the bias can also go the otherway\u00f3countries with weak enforcement may be more willing to adopt the appearance ofstrong patent rights, inducing negative covariance of patent rights with the disturbance andthus a downward bias. However, patent reform is often forced as a condition of entry intonew political groups (e.g., joining the European Union), bilateral trade negotiations, andinternational trade agreements such as TRIPS (Sell, 2003), all of which may limit the scopefor endogenous patent regimes. Price regulation is more likely to su\u00a7er from endogeneity,since governments have greater \u00e1exibility in setting price controls, even if in more recentyears the U.S. has pushed for limitations in the context of bilateral trade agreements (thereare examples in our sample of countries reversing price regulation reforms within a fewyears).To address concerns over endogeneity, we need instrumental variables that are corre-lated with policy choices but do not directly a\u00a7ect the timing of drug launches (and un-correlated with unobserved country level heterogeneity). We use a set of \u00d6ve instrumentsbased on political, legal and demographic characteristics of a country (details of the vari-ables and sources are provided in the Data Appendix). The \u00d6rst isPolitical_Constraintswhich measures the degree to which voting rights within the political (legislative and exec-utive) structure constrains policy change (this is used in the political science literature as aproxy for credible policy commitment). The second isExecutive_Orientationwhich codeswhether the executive comes from a right, left or center party with respect to its orienta-tion on economic policy (the reference category is no executive). The third instrument is28Reverse causality is hard to rationalize in our context, at least contemporaneously. Regime choicemight be negatively correlated withpastlaunch lags \u00f1 long delays might induce governments to introducemore attractive policy regimes \u00f1 but whether this induces endogeneity bias depends heavily on the assumedstructure of errors in the launch and regime choice equations.21Ethnolinguistic_diversitywhich is a measure of population diversity that has been used inthe economics and political science literature as an indicator of di\u00a2culty in reaching andcommitting to political decisions. These three instruments vary across countries and overtime. The fourth instrument,Legal_Origin, codes whether the legal system is based oncommon law (U.K.), French law, or German law, with Socialist or other legal origins as thereference category; this measure is time invariant. The last instrument isRTAwhich is thecumulative number of regional trade agreements that the country has entered into, whichvaries across countries and over time.There is no compelling reason to think that the \u00d6rst three instruments either directly af-fect launch decisions or are correlated with unobserved institutional quality or pro\u00d6tabilityof local markets, conditional on the policy regimes and other controls. However, one mightbe concerned that the number ofRTA\u00eds re\u00e1ects unobserved trade openness of an economy,which could a\u00a7ect launch decisions. For this reason, and more generally to examine therobustness of the parameter estimates to the choice of instruments, we use four alterna-tive subsets of instruments. The narrowest set includes onlyPolitical_ConstraintsandExecutive_Orientation. The second set addsEthnolinguistic_diversity, the third includesLegal_Originand the most expansive set also addsRTA.We begin by testing the exogeneity of price controls and patent policy regimes usingthe Rivers-Vuong (1988) approach. To do this, we estimate \u00eb\u00d6rst stage\u00ed regressions forthe choice of policy regimes\u00f3speci\u00d6cally, a Probit for price regulation and Ordered Pro-bits for the process and product patent regimes. In these regressions, we use all controlsfrom the baseline speci\u00d6cation of the hazard model plus the various sets of instrumentsdescribed above. While the instruments are not derived from a structural model of policyregime choice, the instruments have statistically signi\u00d6cant explanatory power in these re-gressions.29Likelihood ratio tests decisively reject the null hypothesis that the instrumentshave no e\u00a7ect on the choice of price regulation and patent regimes (p-values<0.001 for allfour sets of instruments).30Using the \u00d6rst stage regressions, we compute the generalized29Given the importance of political economy considerations on the choice of intellectual property regimes,constructing such a model remains a di\u00a2cult, and open, research challenge. As indicated in the introduction,existing studies that exploit patent reforms for identi\u00d6cation have treated the policy changes as exogenous.30Details of the \u00d6rst stage parameter estimates are available on request. A brief summary of the qual-itative results for the instruments (based on statistically signi\u00d6cant coe\u00a2cients) is as follows. GreaterPolitical_Constraints(stronger policy commitment) are associated with the absence of price controls andshorter process and product patents.Executive_Orientationfrom a Center party makes price controls lesslikely (more likely with a Left party) and is associated with longer process and product patent protec-tion. HigherEthnolinguistic_diversity(weaker policy commitment) makes price controls less likely, processpatents shorter, and product patents longer. Turning toLegal_Origin,w e\u00d6 n dt h a tp r i c ec o n t r o l sa r em o s tstrongly associated with French legal origins, followed by U.K. and German legal systems. The Germanand U.K. legal origins are also associated with longer process and product patents. Finally, higherRTA(more trade openness) is correlated with longer process and product patents as well as the presence of pricecontrols.22residuals and add them as regressors in the hazard model. Exogeneity of individual policyregimes is tested by the statistical signi\u00d6cance of the coe\u00a2cient on the associated generalizedresiduals, and by joint tests for groups of regimes\u00f3e.g., process and/or product patents.We strongly reject the hypothesis that price controls are exogenous, using each of four in-strument sets (p-values:<0.001 for the \u00d6rst three sets, and 0.004 for the fourth). However,the tests for patent regimes are mixed: we reject the hypothesis thatShort_ProcessandMedium_Productpatent regimes are exogenous, but do not reject the hypothesis for theother four patent regimes (using three of the four instrument sets). However, we stronglyreject the joint hypothesis test that the process patent and/or patent regimes are exogenous(p-values<0.001) using each of the instrument sets.In view of these mixed \u00d6ndings, we proceed to estimate the hazard model allowing forendogenous policy regimes. To do this, we follow the approach of Lillard (1993) and formu-late the model as a system of four simultaneous equations: the hazard launch equation andthe three policy regime equations (probit for price regulation, ordered probits for processand product patent regimes). Each of the regime equations includes all country-level vari-ables from the hazard model plus the instruments described above. This model is estimatedby full information maximum likelihood.31In Table 6 we summarize the FIML parameter estimates for the patent and price regu-lation variables in the hazard equation (For brevity, we suppress coe\u00a2cients for the othercontrols and the \u00ebancillary\u00ed policy regime equations. Details are available on request). Theseestimates were obtained using a piece-wise linear spline for the duration-dependent compo-nent of the log-hazard, which is capable of approximating a variety of parametric models, sothe parameters are not strictly comparable to the Weibull estimates in Tables 4 and 5. Forreference, columns (1) and (2) present the parameters obtained from estimating the base-line speci\u00d6cation of the hazard model as a single equation, and it is worth noting that theestimates in columns (1) and (2) are very similar to those from the Weibull speci\u00d6cation.32Column (2) includes a normally distributed country random e\u00a7ect, with little impact onthe estimated coe\u00a2cients in column (1).3331Two points should be noted. First, we introduce correlation between the disturbances in the launchand regime equations by adding a common random country e\u00a7ect to each (its coe\u00a2cient is normalized inthe process patent equation). In the absence of such correlation, the regimes would not be endogenous inthe launch equation (which the Rivers-Vuong test rejected). E\u00a7orts to estimate the launch equation bynon-linear GMM as a less restrictive alternative to the FIML procedure used did not succeed in obtainingconvergence. With time-varying covariates, the data form a large unbalanced panel in which each observationin the GMM objective function (observed launch status minus predicted in the \u00d6nal period) is conditionalon the entire history of each drug-country up to the last period observed, making the selection of validinstruments very challenging.32The duration-dependent part of the hazard function is modeled using year dummies fort2[0;9]andt>9.E s t i m a t e d c o e \u00a2 c i e n t s o nt h e s e t i m e d u m m i e s i m p l y a p a t t e r no f d u r a t i o nd e p e n d e n c e c o n s i s t e n t w i t haW e i b u l ld i s t r i b u t i o nw i t hs l o p ep a r a m e t e ro fa b o u t0 . 6 ,t h r o u g ht oa b o u t1 2y e a r s .33Not surprisingly, estimated coe\u00a2cients on some of the other country-speci\u00d6c variables that change23Columns (3)-(6) present the FIML estimates for the policy regime variables using alter-native sets of instruments with a country random e\u00a7ect common across equations. Threemain conclusions stand out. First, endogeneity of policy regimes leads us to under-estimatetheir impacts on the timing of drug launches in an uninstrumented single-equation model:the estimated impact of price regulation and the patent regimes here are generally largerthan those obtained when the policy regimes as treated as exogenous. Note that if endo-geneity were driven by unobserved heterogeneity in the pro\u00d6tability of markets, we wouldexpect an upward bias in the magnitude of the coe\u00a2cients. To the contrary, our \u00d6ndingssuggest that the endogeneity bias is more consistent with negative correlation between theadoption of strong policy regimes and unmeasured aspects of political and legal institutions,such as enforcement of patent rights. Second, the overall pattern of policy impacts is similarto what we found in the earlier regressions. Process patents raise the hazard of launch (i.e.,reduce launch lags), and the impact increases with the duration of such patents, thoughthe di\u00a7erences are not all statistically signi\u00d6cant. (Note that in the earlier results for thebaseline speci\u00d6cation we found no signi\u00d6cant impact for long process patents, but when weuse instruments we do). Again, as before, we \u00d6nd thatMedium_ProductandLong_Producthave large impacts on launch lags, while short product patents have little e\u00a7ect. Third, thepattern of estimated parameters is fairly robust across the di\u00a7erent instrument sets.348P o l i c y S i m u l a t i o n sIn this section we simulate how di\u00a7erent policy choices a\u00a7ect the speed of new drug di\u00a7usion.The metric we adopt is the predicted time it takes for 25 percent of drugs to be launched(LAG25) under di\u00a7erent counterfactual policy regimes. Using our estimated parameters,we solve for the value of the 25th percentile of the estimated \u00ebfailure\u00ed function for eachdrug/country observation, conditional on covariates, and then examine the median valueacross observations.35We begin with a benchmark computation ofLAG25for a regimewith no patent protection or price regulation, and then introduce three counterfactual policyregimes: short process patents, long product patents, and price controls. Table (7) showsresults for both for all drugs and for subset of FDA-approved drugs, and then for low,middle and high income countries.relatively little over time (such as health expenditures/GDP) are sensitive to including a country randome\u00a7ect.34There are some exceptions: the impacts ofMedium_ProductandLong_Productare notably larger incolumns (4), (5) and (6), and in column (5) the coe\u00a2cient onShort_Processis not signi\u00d6cant while thecoe\u00a2cient onShort_Productis signi\u00d6cant at the 5 percent level.35To do this, we set the values of the time-varying covariates at their sample means (over time) for eachdrug/country observation. We focus on the median value ofLAG25because many drugs are never launchedin a number of countries, so the distribution ofLAG25is sharply skewed, rendering the mean (or median)of the predicted survival function a somewhat misleading summary statistic.24Panel A of Table 7 is based on the baseline Weibull regression estimates from column(4) of Table 4 which, as discussed in the previous section, likely under-estimate the impactof policy choices on launch lags. The results further con\u00d6rm our descriptive \u00d6ndings thatdi\u00a7usion of new drugs is slow, and varies across drug and income categories.36In thebenchmark case with no patents or price controls, it takes 4.63 years for 25 percent of drugsto be launched in the pooled sample. This falls to 3.01 years for FDA-approved drugs, whichis good news from a welfare perspective. But there is substantial variation across incomecategories\u00f3the median lags are more than three times longer in low income countries (8.85years) as compared to high income countries (2.60 years). Setting the patent regime toshort process patents only (i.e.,Short_Process=1and price controls and all other patentvariables=0) reduces predicted launch lags by about 25 percent. Slightly shorter launchlags are estimated for a regime with no process patents but long product patents (andno price controls). Introducing price controls in a regime with no patents increases lagtimes by 29 percent above the benchmark. Recall that given the functional form of thebaseline empirical model, the percentage e\u00a7ects of these policy regimes are additive: thusintroducing both price controls andLong_Productgenerates a predicted median value ofLAG25of 4.09 years. In other words, price regulation removes most of accelerated di\u00a7usioninduced by long product patents.Panel B presents the median predicted launch lags when we use the FIML parame-ter estimates on the policy variables, which take into account the endogeneity of policyregimes.37Using these coe\u00a2cients, product patents emerge as much more e\u00a7ective thanprocess patents (69 percent reduction in launch lags compared to 29 percent), and priceregulation has a very large impact, more than doubling launch lags.In both panels, the same pattern of results holds for the subset of FDA-approved drugs,and for low, middle, and high income countries. In low income countries,LAG25is de-pressingly high in the benchmark case, at almost nine years. Notice that, based on theseresults, a policy regime directed solely at lowering prices on drugs that have been alreadybeen launched (no patents, and strong price controls) would increase launch lags very sub-stantially to over three times longer than in a \u00ebpro-innovator\u00ed regime with no price controlsand long product patents.Some quali\u00d6cations should be kept in mind. First, these calculations are not a welfareassessment of di\u00a7erent regimes\u00f3that would require, at a minimum, consideration of howthese policies they a\u00a7ect drug prices. This is extremely di\u00a2cult unless one can model both36Although similar to the numbers in Table 3, note that these \u00d6gures are not directly comparable sincethey control for economic and demographic variables, drug therapeutic class, and set the patent and pricecontrols policy variables to counterfactual values.37Speci\u00d6cally we recompute the predicted launch lags from the Weibull model after substituting thecoe\u00a2cients on the patent and price controls variables with values from the FIML estimates in column (3) ofTable 6 (which has a minimal, conservative instrument list).25the demand side\u00f3as a practical matter, this requires restricting the analysis to speci\u00d6cclasses of drugs (e.g., Chaudry, Goldberg and Gia, 2006)\u00f3and the supply side, i.e., theinvestment required for launch. Second, because our empirical model is not structural,counterfactual assessment of policies is subject to the Lucas critique, among other issues.A third, and related, point is that countries develop institutions, and invest in humancapital, over long time periods, and in ways that both in\u00e1uence, and in turn are in\u00e1uencedby, the policy regimes they adopt. Thus there may be important, and unmodeled, pathdependencies driving observed outcomes\u00f3and the estimated policy impacts shown heremay take many years to unfold. Any assessment of a new policy regime needs to take intoaccount the capacity of the country to adapt and the costs of doing so.9C o n c l u d i n g R e m a r k sThis paper studies how patent rights and price regulation a\u00a7ect launch lags for new drugs.Using new data on launches of 642 new molecules in 76 countries during 1983-2002, we showthat, all else equal, longer and more extensive patent protection accelerated di\u00a7usion, whileprice regulation strongly delayed it. Health policy institutions, and economic factors thatmake markets more pro\u00d6table, also sped up di\u00a7usion. These results hold both for develop-ing countries and high income countries, and the results are robust to using instrumentalvariables to address the endogeneity of policy regimes. Our \u00d6ndings also raise the broaderpoint, not limited to pharmaceuticals, that patent rights can have an important impact onthedi\u00a7usionof new innovations as well as on the rate at which new innovations are created.Of course, the same policies that promote faster launch\u00f3stronger patent rights andthe absence of price regulation\u00f3are also those that raise prices. This highlights the basictradeo\u00a7 countries face between making new drug therapies available and making thema\u00a7ordable. Finding ways to best mitigate the adverse e\u00a7ects of this tradeo\u00a7 is a majorchallenge.There are two main directions for future research. One is to study how severe thetradeo\u00a7 between faster di\u00a7usion and higher prices actually is\u00f3i.e., how much prices areraised by stronger process or product patent protection\u00f3by using data on sales and priceswithin countries with di\u00a7erent patent regimes. A second interesting direction for researchis to develop a structural model of drug launches which could be used to back out unob-served launch costs in each country and then to conduct important counterfactual policyexperiments. One question of particular interest is the e\u00a7ects on global drug di\u00a7usion ofintroducing multilateral recognition of drug trials and regulatory approval.26References[1] Acemoglu, Daron and Joshua Linn (2004), \u00ecMarket Size in Theory andEvidence from the Pharmaceutical Industry,\u00eeQuarterly Journal of Economics,119(3):1049-1090[2] Arrow, Kenneth (1962), \u00ecEconomic Welfare and the Allocation of Resources for In-vention,\u00ee in Richard Nelson, ed.,The Rate and Direction of Economic Activities: Eco-nomic and Social Factors, National Bureau of Economic Research Conference Series(Princeton: Princeton University Press): 609-626[3] Baier, Scott and of Economics, 71: Nathan Blalock of New Drugs inthe Post-TRIPS Era,\u00eeInternational Journal of the Economics of Business,18(2):203-224[5] Bloom, Nicholas and John van Reenen (1998) \u00ecRegulating Drug Where Do (2001), \u00ecDo Stronger Patents Induce MoreInnovation: Evidence from the 1988 Japanese Patent Law Reforms,\u00eeRAND Journalof Economics, 32: 77-100[7] Branstetter, Lee, Raymond Fishman and C.

This was derived from the dating of launches of drug products, which contain thenew drug, in combination with inactive ingredients and potentially other active ingredients.The distinction between \u00ebdrug\u00ed and \u00ebdrug product\u00ed is signi\u00d6cant. Not all new drugs arelaunched as exactly the same product in all countries. A given \u00ebactive moiety\u00ed may beapproved as di\u00a7erent salts or esters (as hydrochloride, maleateetc.) or in di\u00a7erent galenical forms (tablet, injectable, topical cream etc.), or may be soldin combination with di\u00a7erent sets of other active ingredients.Drug launches were identi\u00d6ed from two sources of data, in which the unit of observationis a drug product. The \u00d6rst is the December 2002 version of the \u00ecLifeCycle: Drug Launches\u00eedatabase obtained from IMS Health, Inc. This \u00d6le contained 187,725 observations on retaildrug product launches for the period 1982-2002. The unit of observation is product-country-year, with each observation recording: (1) the trade name (proprietary product name, orbrand name); (2) a listing of active ingredients using non-proprietary generic chemical name;(3) the composition, listing the formulation (capsule, syrup, powder etc.) and amounts,strength or concentration of the active ingredient(s); (4) the date the product goes on sale;and (5) the therapeutic class of the product using the World Health Organization\u00eds \u00ebATC\u00edAnatomical Therapeutical Chemical classi\u00d6cation system at the third level. This databasecovers all therapeutic classes, but not all countries. Coverage of countries increased overtime, with product launches observed in 45 countries in 1982, increasing to 66 in the early1990s, and to 76 by the end of the sample. In two cases country was coded by IMSas a region: French West Africa, consisting of Benin, Cameroon, Congo, Cote d\u00edIvoire,Gabon, Guinea, and Senegal; and Central America consisting of Costa Rica, El Salvador,Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama. Notably, India was not included in this databaseduring this period.The drug launch data for India were obtained from a second source, the \u00ecFirstIndia\u00eedataset of product sales compiled by ORG MARG, a market research company. This coversthe period 1967 to 1997 but only for a partial set of therapeutic classes, namely antibiotics,cancer, and antiulcer. There were 498 observations on brand name, active ingredient(s),therapeutic class, and launch date.Identifying drug launches in these data consistently across countries and over time wasa serious challenge. In the data, 14 percent of records had no listing of active ingredients,only a brand name, for about one \u00d6fth of which the active ingredient could be \u00ebrecovered\u00edthrough lookup of the brand name or through parsing of the composition \u00d6eld. Moreover,24 percent of records were for multi-ingredient or combination products: in some cases more31than 20 ingredients were listed. About 20 percent of products fell into categories in whichactive ingredients were prohibitively di\u00a2cult to identify consistently (vaccines, biologics,hormones, allergens, immune globulins etc.), appeared to be for non-prescription productssuch as nostrums, over-the-counter, or proprietary formulations, herbal and homeopathicmedicines, or were for \u00ebnon-drug\u00ed medical products, such as blood-testing strips, imagingcontrast agents, non-medicinal or inactive ingredients or excipients, diagnostics, and surgicalsolutions.As a preliminary step, we therefore excluded 17,452 records for products whose in-gredients could not be identi\u00d6ed. After a very careful e\u00a7ort to identify brand names ofknown drugs, we believe that no instances of launches of new drugs were excluded for thisreason. We further excluded 37,199 records in therapeutic classes largely populated withnon-prescription or hard to identify products,38and 2,274 records for vaccines.Remaining records were \u00ebunpacked\u00ed to give one observation per ingredient per product,with the exception of 29 combination drugs given a distinct non-proprietary name in theBritish Pharmacopeia where ingredients were combined.39This created an additional 29,784observations, and was done to be \u00ebover-inclusive\u00ed in identifying drug launches: while manydrug products combine active ingredients, treating all combinations of new and old chemicalentities as distinct products would result in spuriously high counts of new products, andunder-identi\u00d6cation of launches of new entities.In principle each active ingredient is unambiguously identi\u00d6ed by the generic name,in practice these are not fully standardized, or may use spelling variations from di\u00a7erentlanguages, or may not have been assigned. After excluding non-drug or hard-to-identifyproducts and ingredients, we observe 9,065 distinct active ingredients in the remaining115,123 observations on country and ingredient. Considerable e\u00a7ort was invested in cod-ing these consistently, to avoid under-identi\u00d6cation of drug launches. A variety of onlineand hardcopy reference sources were consulted, including: theChemIDplusdatabase main-38Products in following therapeutic classes: toothpaste miscella-neous), parenteral nutrition, smoking cessation, herbal cough and cold, oph-thalmics, otologicals, allergens, herbal and homoeopathic V) or through manual examination. Vitamins and non-prescription or OTC drugs were identi\u00d6ed fromreference sources such as the Physicans\u00eds Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs and Dietary Supple-ments. Herbal and homeopathic products were identi\u00d6ed by hand inspection, lookup in Physicians\u00ed DeskReference for Herbal Medicine, or being manufactured by a company specializing in herbal products e.g.Arkopharma, Weleda.39These are the drug theWHO-MedNetdatabase, the Universityof AlbertaDrugBankdatabase, theDrugBasedatabase published by Products Database, the FDA\u00edsInactive IngredientsDatabase, the Kyoto University and University of TokyoKEGG DRUGdatabase, and current and historical editions of theMartindale Complete Drug Referencepublished by The Pharmaceutical Press, theMerck Index,t h eIndex Nominumpublished bythe Swiss Pharmaceutical Society, and theUSP Dictionary of United States Adopted Names(USAN) and International Drug Namespublished by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention.When possible, generic chemical names were matched to the WHO\u00eds listing of InternationalNonproprietary Names (INNs); when an INN was not available, the USP USAN, BritishApproved Name, or Japanese Approved Name was used.As a further measure to avoid under-identi\u00d6cation of country launches, the parts of activeingredient names corresponding to salts, esters or non-covalent derivatives were removed toarrive at the \u00ebactive moiety\u00ed. This corresponds roughly to the New Chemical Entity in U.S.usage. Treating di\u00a7erent salts, esters and derivatives as distinct entities would result in asigni\u00d6cantly larger number of new drugs. For each of the 2,265 such chemical entities in thesource dataset we determine the \u00d6rst worldwide launch date, based on the earliest of (1)the \u00d6rst date it appears in the IMS or ORG MARG datasets, (2) the \u00d6rst date it appearsin the FDA\u00eds drugs@fda approvals database, (3) the \u00d6rst date it was listed as approvedfor marketing in any country in the Pharmaprojects database. To avoid problems withleft-censoring of launch dates in 1982 in the IMS data, we exclude any drugs for which the\u00d6rst worldwide launch date de\u00d6ned this way was before 1983. We also exclude drugs thatwere only launched in Japan and Taiwan and/or Korea, which appear to re\u00e1ect medicalpractice idiosyncratic to this region. This leaves us with 642 drugs, for which we observe17,189 drug-country observations on the timing of launches.To prepare this dataset for survival analysis, we use the \u00d6rst worldwide launch date todetermine t=0 for each molecule, and then for each drug-country combination create annualobservations for the time-varying and non-time varying covariates described below for eachyear until either the drug is launched in that country or is censored. Care was taken toexclude country-years where a drug was not at risk of launching (as observed in these data),for example if data were not reported for that country until after the \u00d6rst worldwide launchdate, or if the drug were in a therapeutic class not covered in these data for that country,for example antihypertensives in India. This gives a total of 298,605 observations on 38,180drug-country combinations, with the launch date was censored for 20,991 drug-countrycombinations.33Explanatory variablesPatent ProtectionWe construct measures of the availability and duration of patent protection for (a)pharmaceutical products and (b) chemical processes is coded for each country-year, alongwith presence of enforcement mechanisms.Two sources were used. Data compiled by Ginarte and Park (1997) and Park (2008)who give dummy variables coded every 5 years 1960-2000 for up to 120 countries on (1)\u00ebCoverage\u00ed\u00f3i.e., availability of patent protection for di\u00a7erent classes of subject matter, herethe relevant category is chemicals and pharmaceuticals, process and product; (2) patentterm, measured as years from \u00d6ling or years from grant; (3) treaty membership in PCT,Paris Convention and UPOV; and (4) presence of various enforcement mechanisms andother factors impacting the scope of rights, such as preliminary injunctions, requirementsto work, contributory infringement, compulsory licensing etc. This information was cross-referenced against the text of relevant statues and treaties, published inWorld Patent Lawand Practice: Patent Statutes, Regulations, and Treatiesby Cotreau 1974, seriatim), Throughout the World,an annually updated looseleaf publication (New York: West Group). The Statutes, Reg-ulations, and Treaties information are taken as de\u00d6nitive regarding dating of changes inpatent term, coverage of pharmaceuticals and chemical processes, patent term extensions,duration of term for foreign versus domestic applicants, and provide some ability to \u00ebback\u00d6ll\u00ed the Ginarte-Park data to identify more precisely changes in the patent regime. Thereare occasional inconsistencies and con\u00e1icts between national law and multinational treatiese.g. Andean Pact, Bangui Agreement. In these cases, the provisions of the national law aretaken as de\u00d6nitive.Using these data we de\u00d6ne: Patent_Term = Max (Years from grant +2, Years from\u00d6ling). The distribution of country/year observations by patent term is as follows:Patent_Term 0 3 7 10 12 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 22No. obs 9 17 21 77 59 15 83 35 175 39 38 694 12Using the patent term, we de\u00d6ne the following process and product patent regimes:Short_Process=1 if chemical processes patentable and0<Patent_Term12Short_Product=1 if pharmaceutical products patentable and0<Patent_Term12Medium_Process=1 if chemical processes patentable and13Patent_Term17Medium_Product=1 if pharmaceutical products patentable and13Patent_Term17Long_Process=1 if andPatent_Term>17Long_Product=1 if pharmaceutical products patentable andPatent_Term>1734Pro-patent Index= sum of dummies for whether:a) patent term is the same for domestic and foreign applicantsb) preliminary injunctions are availablec) infringer can be liable for contributory infringementd) burden of proof of infringement is reversed for process inventionse) patents cannot be revoked for failure to workf) there is no requirement to work the patent, or can be satis\u00d6ed by importationg) there is no compulsory licensingh) term extensions are available for pharmaceuticalsPrice ControlsEach country\u00eds price control regime was coded as None/Some/Extensive from the sourceslisted in Lanjouw (2005). The designation \u00ebSome\u00ed means that the country has formal pricecontrol regulation but it covers only a subset of drugs. \u00ebExtensive\u00ed means that the regula-tion covers most drugs and/or is viewed in the sources as particularly restrictive. In theregressions a dummy variable for price control regime = Extensive is used.Demographic and Income VariablesAge distribution: For each country-year, the total population, and percentage of thepopulation over 65 years old are taken from the World Bank,World Development Indicators.We also used the percentage of the population under 5 years old, but found no e\u00a7ect in theregressions.Income per capita:For each country, annual values of real GDP per capita (RGDPCH)are taken from the Penn World Table version 6.2Income inequality:We use the Gini coe\u00a2cient as reported in the World Bank\u00eds World De-velopment Indicators. Since there are rarely more than two observations per country 1975-2005, missing values are interpolated using \u00d6rst-observation-carried-back for years prior tothe \u00d6rst observed value, and then last-observation-carried-forward subsequently.Health care expenditures:For each country, total health care expenditure as percent ofGDP is taken from the World Bank\u00eds World Development Indicators. This is only con-sistently available 1990 onwards, and missing data are interpolated using \u00d6rst-observation-carried-back for years prior to 1990.Health InstitutionsWe use the following dummy variables:EDL = 1 if the country has adopted an Essential Drug ListNDP =1 if the country has adopted a National Drug PolicyNF = 1 if the country has adopted a National FormularyEach of these variables varies across countries and time. Taken from sources listed inLanjouw (2005).35Local Technical CapacityChemicals Patentsis a count of U.S. patents by application date in any of the IPCclasses corresponding to chemical engineering and manufacturing, as indexed by the Amer-ican Chemical Society (these include Pesticides, Medicial Preparations, Chemical Methodsand Processes, Inorganic Chemistry, Fertilizers, Organic Chemistry, Macromolecules, Dyesand Paints, Petrochemicals, Soaps and Oils, Beverages and Vinegar, Microbiology andFermentation, Sugar, and Analyzing Materials); plus Chemical or Physical Laboratory Ap-paratus, Biocides and Pest Repellants, and Apparatus for Enzymology or Microbiology.This count is constructed for each country/year, based on the country of the inventor(s)listed on the patent, and then converted to a stock using a 15 percent depreciation rate.GovernanceRule of Law and Regulatory Quality index values and rank order (for 181 countries)published in World Bank,Worldwide Governance Indicatorsfor 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002(not available before 1996). We use \u00d6rst-observation-carried-back for years prior to 1996,then last-observation-carried-forward.Instrumental VariablesPolitical_Constraints:a measure of credible policy commitment (the degree of politicalconstraints on policy change). It is derived from a spatial model of political interaction andis based on the number of independent veto points in the di\u00a7erent branches of the politicalsystem and the distribution of political preferences both across and within these branches.Higher values represent greater political constraints (and thus greater policy commitment).For details see Henisz (2000).Executive_Orientation:a dummy variable that codes whether the executive comes froma right, left or center party with respect to its orientation on economic policy. Both ofthese variables vary both across countries and over time. Source:World Bank Database ofPolitical Institutions: Changes and Variable De\u00d6nitions(Philip Keefer, December 2009).Ethnolinguistic_diversity:a measure commonly used as an indicator of di\u00a2culty inreaching and committing to political decisions. This index varies across countries and overtime. For details, La Porta et al. (1999).Legal_Origin:The historical origins of the legal system for each country is coded aseither common law (U.K.), French law, German law, Socialist or Scandanavian (\u00d6xed foreach country over time). For details, see La Porta et al. (1999).Regional Trade Agreements (RTA):the cumulative number of regional trade agreementsthat the country has entered as of a given year. This varies across countries and over time.These data were compiled from Table 3 of Baier and Bergstrand (2007), supplemented withthe WTO web site (http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/region_e/summary_e.xls).
