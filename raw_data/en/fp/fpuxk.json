The company\u00b4s mission is to promote a holistic approach to plastic surgery and cosmetic medicine, creating a world destination for beauty, health, and happiness. Board-certified plastic surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Yager will serve as SYA's Medical Director, offering facial, breast and body procedures (surgical and non-invasive), along with traditional med spa facials and full-body laser treatments. SYA CEO Dr. Jingduan Yang is a board-certified psychiatrist specializing in integrative mental health care. He is also a fifth-generation teacher and practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine, specializing in acupuncture. The doctor will bring his unique perspective and expertise in Cosmetic Acupuncture to clients, including his groundbreaking acupuncture facelift. Dr. Yang also developed a specialized 12-week program, which facilitates the delivery of essential nutrients and increases blood flow to skin cells, promoting cellular regeneration and enhancing skin vitality. This results in a more radiant complexion, while also activating specific points to achieve weight loss. \"After 26 years of plastic surgery private practice in Manhattan, I was by every metric successful,\" Dr. Yager says. \"I loved helping people reach their aesthetic goals, and I enjoyed the process\u2014yet there was always a nagging feeling that I could be doing more. I met Dr. Yang, and felt immediate chemistry and synergy during our many meaningful conversations. The more we spoke, I realized my goal shouldn't simply be making people look better, but rather making them happy and fulfilled on the inside. Sometimes it goes much deeper than a surgery, by way of repairing an emotional or spiritual wound. I agreed to be a part of SY Aesthetics to lead the evolution of plastic surgery, as well as beauty from within.\" Adds Dr. Yang, \"Dr. Yager and I come from different professional backgrounds, but our end goal is the same. Our ability to marry aesthetics with internal happiness will be our key to satisfied patients and a successful partnership. I look forward to connecting with the Upper Manhattan and Middletown communities, and lending my knowledge of Chinese medicine to create a healthier future.\" Dr. Yang and Dr. Yager will be featured panelists at the 2023 [Aesthetic Integrative Medicine and Surgery (AIMS)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://theaimssociety.org/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1692743376333023%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3HR0sFrolnpU31rz-xNb4I&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1692743376340340&usg=AOvVaw0RDYTXvuzwa4aC_Vcn2pYK) Symposium on September 29-30, 2023, hosted by The AIMS Society.
