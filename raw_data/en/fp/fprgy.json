Editor's Pick What you don't know about hemp oil and CBD supplements More people are searching for all-natural ways to remedy the conditions that ail them. Some don't trust Big Pharma to have their best interests at heart, whereas others simply don't like the negative side effects that come with a lot of the prescription medications. This is leading more people to CBD and hemp oil for help, hoping to find much-needed relief. One cannabis compound that pops up repeatedly is cannabidiol, also known more commonly as CBD. But what is it? ChiroEco.com/hemp-oil-cbd-supplements Missed the Last Issue? Crack the Code It's time to rethink the way you approach documentation. ChiroEco.com/magazine 8 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COMA phrase you'll hear a lot in the telecom, cable, and internet industries is \"the last mile.\" It refers to the fact that you can run a cable from a central facility out to a local neighborhood fairly cheaply, but the final connection to the customer's house is where a lot of the expense occurs. In a way, the same thing happens in healthcare, too. By most estimates, 80 percent of a person's lifetime medical expenses are incurred in the last 10 years of life. That final stretch can involve assisted living, nursing homes, and intensive care. You probably know someone \u2014possibly a family member\u2014who while elderly, is at home, active and alert, using their days happily and productively. Others may be struggling, in pain, and not fully aware of their surroundings. Why do we have these divergent outcomes? Some of the answer, of course, lies in genetics. This is why taking a family history during patient intake is now standard practice. Another part of the answer is lifestyle. People who spend their lives doing difficult physical labor can have chronic health conditions later as a result of overuse injuries. High-performing athletes can be prone to this, too. As people age, especially in their 50s and beyond, sedentary habits and poor diet can lead to tragic outcomes. With planning and effort, though, it is possible to maxi - mize one's chances at having what can be termed \"golden years.\" Chiropractic can play a large part in helping a patient get there. For example, a grave risk to older adults is posed by simple slips and falls. These can precipitate an extended medical stay that turns into a downward spiral. One reason seniors are prone to these accidents is that proprioception tends to decline with age as the nervous system is less faithful in its reporting. Regular adjustments can help to counteract this. This issue of Chiropractic Economics looks at anti-aging strategies you can recommend to your older patients. Note that the term \"anti-aging\" today is better understood as \"wellness-aging.\" We can't turn back the clock (yet), but we can take real and proven steps to make that \"last mile\" in life a good one.

A recent study, first published in Calcified Tissue International, offers new, empirical data looking specifically at the effect of chiropractic manipulation on levels of osteoporotic bone loss. The study opens new options for research and application of chiropractic manipulation for a growing patient group suffering from bone-density changes related to aging or other factors. For the study, researchers in Spain created a variety of test groups of six-month-old Sprague- Dawley rats. A first test group underwent an ovariectomy (OVX) operation, while a second test group underwent a sham operation. Both groups were further divided into sub-groups receiving true chiropractic manipulation with the Activator V, false manipulation (FM), or no manipulation (NM). The study found that true chiropractic manipulation can improve the osteoporotic bone by targeting skeletal muscle.

Performance Health funds expanded study on chiropractic's impact on reduction in opioid prescriptions Performance Health, the maker of Biofreeze Professional, is pleased to announce its significant financial support of the Clinical Compass as part of its national Safer Pain Relief campaign. These funds are earmarked for a second study on the impact of chiropractic care on opioid and drug use for large patient populations. The first study, conducted in 2016 on over 12,000 subjects with lower back pain, revealed that patients seen by a chiropractor have a 55 percent less likelihood of filling an opioid prescription as compared to those not under chiropractic care. The study, Association Between Utilization of Chiropractic Services and Use of Prescription Opioids Among Patients with Low Back Pain, also showed that the average annual per-person charges for opioid prescription fills were 78 percent lower for recipients of chiropractic services as compared to non-recipients. The final results of the study are currently under peer review for publication. \"This second study will have a massive impact on patients, providers of health services, payers and policymakers. We will not just be moving the needle with this study, we will be changing the game on how healthcare is delivered in our country, and be a major force in reducing opioid addiction,\" said Jay S.

The contract commissioned three annual surveys, each examining a different aspect of Americans' attitudes toward chiropractic. On October 3, 2017, Palmer College released the findings of the third and final survey, 2017 Gallup-Palmer College of Chiropractic Annual Report: Americans' Views of Prescription Pain Medication and Chiropractic Care, which was conducted from February 8 through March 13, 2017. Among the top-line findings in the report, a majority of Americans (eight out of 10) think chiropractic can help manage back and neck pain, but similarly, a majority (nearly 70 percent) would prefer to see a chiropractor who worked closely with their other doctors. A significant number of chiropractic patients find that out-of-pocket costs limit their access to care, as insurance coverage for chiropractic services is uneven and deductibles are increasingly high.

Up to 40 percent of cancers diagnosed in U.S. are associated with obesity Overweight and obesity are associated with increased risk of 13 types of cancer. These cancers account for about 40 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the U.S. in 2014, according to the latest Vital Signs report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Overall, the rate of new cancer cases has decreased since the 1990s, but increases in overweight- and obesity-related cancers are likely slowing this progress. About 630,000 people in the U.S. were diagnosed with a cancer associated with overweight and obesity in 2014. About 2 in 3 occurred in adults 50 to 74 years old. The rates of obesity-related cancers, not including colorectal cancer, increased by 7 percent between 2005 and 2014. The rates of non-obesity related cancers declined during that time. \"A majority of American adults weigh more than recommended\u2014and being overweight or obese puts people at higher risk for a number of cancers\u2014so these findings are a cause for concern,\" says CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald, MD. \"By getting to and keeping a healthy weight, we all can play a role in cancer prevention.\" To read more, visit ChiroEco.com/cancer40 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cdc.gov ADOBE STOCK 14 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COMTECHNIQUE SPEAK Originally, after I had created Koren Publications, I thought that lecturing to chiropractic groups, writing for jour - nals, and working in private practice would be my ultimate professional accomplishments. But life had some - thing else in store for me. Born of a need Years ago, my family was moving, and boxes and furniture were all over the place. I didn't notice the large, heavy, sharp-edged laminate piece balanced on its edge behind the door I closed. It fell on me. It was a bad accident, and as a result I had no strength and suffered 10 years of intense pain and paresthesia\u2014in my shoulders, arms, hands, neck, and spine, plus debili - tating sciatica. Because pain is a great motivator, I wound up spending a small fortune traveling all over North America, and I saw 40 to 50 chiropractors who used nearly every technique, plus MDs, DOs, PTs, acupuncturists, craniosa - cral practitioners, and bodyworkers, but my condition continued to deteriorate. Some days I could only walk a few feet at a time. I could not use my hands, and I ultimately gave up my license to practice. I didn't want to resort to surgery the way many of my adult relatives with injuries had done. So with research, study, and experimentation, I eventually figured out a way to analyze and adjust myself. Rapid recovery To my surprise, I found the sublux - ations, stress, and interference all those great doctors had missed\u2014and discovered a new way of adjusting. After 10 years of suffering, I was better in five days\u2014I was my first Koren Specific Technique (KST) patient. My wife, Beth, for her part had suffered from migraines for some 12 years. She was the second KST patient. Following one correction that took almost no time at all, her head-aches were gone and never came back. The next 1,000-plus KST patients were mostly chiropractors who, like me, could find no one else for help. Considering that the chiropractic profession has over 100 named tech - niques already, I asked myself, \"Do we need another one?\" But KST was delivering results where other techniques had failed. The lines were going out the door when I'd demonstrate KST at conferences and Born of necessity KST: Breakthrough protocol to patient care. BY TEDD KOREN, DCADOBE STOCK CHIROECO.COM ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COMTECHNIQUESPEAK seminars. Doctors of chiropractic were repeatedly telling me, \"This was the best adjustment of my life.\" I knew I was on to something. DD's three causes It's now 10 years later and over 3,000 chiropractors and other healers have taken a KST seminar. In some ways, I see KST as the future of healthcare. Its universal applications honor DD Palmer's three causes of dis-ease: trauma, thoughts, and toxins, because KST addresses all three. Putting theory into practice KST is practiced using three tradi - tional concepts: challenge, check and correct. 1. Challenge: A body part is gently stroked, pushed, or pulled to see if it elicits subluxation stress. That is the physical way to practice KST.2. Check: Does the body respond to the stimulus? Biofeedback is the simplest and most accurate way to locate what needs correction, in the proper order and posture. 3. Correct: Using your hands or an instrument, perform the adjustment. Then repeat the challenge to see if the subluxation is gone. The posture of subluxation Subluxations are sneaky things. They come and go as we stand, sit, move, and experience physiological stress (e.g., emotional or chemical imbal - ances). A simple example is a car accident victim. If they sit and hold an imaginary steering wheel, you'll find subluxations that may not be apparent when they lie on a table. Correcting the patient in the posture in which they are experiencing subluxation gives powerful results.The body as a hologram Modern research reveals that the body (especially the brain) functions as a hologram: One part can reflect and influence other parts. This is the basis behind reflexology or iridology, for example. DD Palmer was aware of this phenomenon when he wrote [The purpose of the adjustment is] for the reduction of the physical repre - sentative of the cause of dis-ease. The sole purpose of chiropractic is to unite man the physical with man the spiritual.The \"physical representative\" DD Palmer referred to can be seen in the subluxation, which serves as the holo - graphic gateway to the mind-body complex. From interference to freedom Through the use of KST, subluxations that represent stresses locked in the body and mind can now be located 20 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COM and addressed, including allergies, asthma, ADD, dyslexia, concentra - tion problems, PTSD, emotional problems, phobias, weight issues, bad habits, toxicity, disc issues, athletic performance, and structural (neuro - musculoskeletal) pain. One of KST's breakthroughs is the importance of correcting the patient in the posture of subluxation \u2014whether that posture be physical or emotional. One of KST's unique applications is that it's possible to work on oneself. That's how I learned it. But, most importantly, patients love KST; they request it, and they bring in their families. For every patient who \"loves a good crack,\" 20 are staying away. Practitioners of KST report practice growth as patient satisfaction and retention increase. I frequently get testimonials like the following: Today, a patient's mum called to share that her son, who is known to be a slow learner, came in tops in his most recent test after one session of KST. She was amazed. I'm very happy for her son, but I thought this is so unfair\u2014there wasn't KST care during my schooling days. \u2014K.N., DC, Singapore I love that I can correct subluxations while the patient is actively going through their range of motion. I have a tool and technique to finally adjust the cranium, etc. KST has infinite possibilities. \u2014S.H., DC, Flint, Michigan The people down here in the Dominican Republic absolutely LOVE KST. I was told that it was very important that I do firm traditional manual adjustments because this is what Dominicans like, and that low force techniques tend to be rejected down here. Not the case with KST. After my first week of seeing patients, my practice nearly doubled, and many patients are referring their spouses and families. \u2014C.P., DC, Dominican Republic KST continues to grow and is now practiced by nearly 3,000 healthcare practitioners around the world to locate and release physical and emotional blockages, toxic stress, and subluxations. I hope the stories above have inspired you to explore Koren Specific Technique further. TEDD KOREN , DC, has made original contributions to chiropractic philosophy, art, and science. Koren Specific Technique (KST) is an exciting breakthrough protocol used to find the type of subluxations that doctors often miss.

People everywhere take the respiratory system for granted and indulge in shallow and even para - doxical breathing (PB), where the diaphragm moves opposite to the normal direction. But faulty and abnormal breathing are likely to hamper health and detract from ther - apeutic gains. Clinical evidence abounds regarding the benefits of good breathing in wellness modalities such as Ayurvedic and Siddha medicine, yoga, and tai chi. And notably, some of these healthcare practices have subsisted for millennia. So what should you know about healthy breathing techniques and integrating them into your own practice? Groupthink about breathing Converts to alternative treatment techniques, including chiropractic, find it disheartening that there is so much groupthink in modern health - care, even with regard to something as fundamental as AB. A narrow focus on one's own field that overlooks the benefits of complementary practices could impede the adoption of valid healing practices that deliver quicker results. Unquestionably, there is consider - able clinical evidence of the healing power of breath to keep the body firing on all cylinders. 1 This evidence also points to other effective remedies to be found in alternative healthcare practices for various mental and physical illnesses. 2,3 It is also note- worthy that integrating some of these practices into chiropractic could realize sizeable savings in the cost of healthcare.The power of breathing This traditional practice should be in your clinical toolkit. BY SUDHANVA CHAR, DC ADOBE STOCK CHIROECO.COM NOVEMBER 14, 2017CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 2324 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COMCLINICALCONCERNS For the most part, the various healthcare practices do not converse with one another as much as they should in the broader interest of patient wellness. This happens even when they are not in direct compe-tition. It is even rarer for a given modality to acquire techniques from alternative practices. Narrow, silo-thinking undeniably obstructs the interchange of ideas and innovation. This represents a consid - erable loss to the profession, especially where there may be more than one way\u2014and even a better way\u2014to skin a cat. Had the Palmers been aware of it, they would likely not have let a technique such as AB go to waste. Shallow breathing, wide effects Normally, in most health assessment intakes, there are questions about diet, drinking, smoking, lifestyle, and so forth, but seldom any questions about breathing practices. But shallow breath or PB can indicate how close to ill-health, or how deeply entangled in health-related distress a patient is. Poor breathing is rarely associated with robust health and wellness. More often than not, most patients' breathing is likely to be merely thoracic or, worse, clavicular. These two habits result in shallow breathing, which short-shrifts the critical func - tions of oxygen delivery to cells and the flushing out of carbon dioxide. Such a finding would call for damage control through AB. On top of any chiropractor's diag - nostic checklist, it would be helpful to have AB as one of the assessment tests. David Coulter, PhD, calls it abdominodiaphragmatic breathing. He says that \"thoraco-diaphragmatic breathing is the perfect compromise\" when deep AB cannot be started right away for compelling reasons. 4The only rational respiratory mode AB is the only sound pattern of breathing. This is because oxygen is the life-force that sustains wellbeing. Trillions of cells in the human body, particularly the neurons in the brain, tend to languish for more oxygen that could lower their rate of atrophy. For the agitated or stressed mind, it is perhaps the best pacifier. Also, carbon dioxide is released even as oxygen is absorbed through the phenomenon of gas exchange occurring in the alveoli cells in lungs. Functionally speaking, deep AB effi - ciently sustains the respiratory system. It is the raison d'\u00eatre of fitness and wellbeing. Perhaps what is worse than shallow clavicular and thoracic breathing is PB observed in a majority of people. In PB, the upturned diaphragm below the ribcage moves in the reverse 26 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COM direction compared to someone breathing normally. During inha - lation, the diaphragm is pulled up rather than pushed down, making the abdominal wall go in instead of out. During exhalation the ribcage seems to shift abnormally, pushing the diaphragm down and in turn shoving the abdominal walls out making it appear to expand even if slightly. This type of flawed breathing pattern, if sustained over enough time, shrinks lung capacity and volume, reducing its functionality. PB, if sustained throughout a person's lifespan, is detrimental to robust mental and physical health. It starves the cells of oxygen and does a poor job of expelling carbon dioxide. Incorrect breathing in its own right can usher in a host of health problems. The elephant in the diagnostic room While AB helps with deep breathing and expanding the lungs, shallow breathing and PB reduce the func - tionality of the cardiovascular system to a suboptimal level. The heart rate is reduced, and homeostasis is weak - ened\u2014as is the immune response. Nature intends for respiration to be efficient, and inhalation and exhalation involve more than just breathing in and out. It is the natural expression of the life-force, expressed spontaneously. Surprisingly, in a majority of cases, humans breathe incompetently. It is high time the elephant in the diag - nostic room is recognized for what it is, and AB should be promoted in every clinic worth its salt. Lead your patients toward happy and deep abdominal breathing.

CLINICALCONCERNS Chiropractors see a lot of running injuries. Shin splints are among the most common and persistent types of injury among them. A recent study found that medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) can sideline a new runner for 70 days or more. 1 The diagnosis is usually uncompli - cated, but chiropractors should also rule out other causes. Occasionally, a painful shinbone may be a sign of a more serious problem. \"Shin splints, stress fractures, and anterior compartment syndrome can look alike,\" says Jason Hare, DC, who owns Pure Chiropractic in Nanaimo, BC, Canada. \"All three injuries are easily confused.\" Recognizing the difference is vital for ensuring proper treatment and recovery. While shin splints often heal with rest, the other two conditions require more extensive treatment\u2014and sometimes even surgery. Pinpointing the problem Medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints) is an overuse injury caused by repetitive impact. The repeated stress on the lower leg causes inflammation of the muscles, tendons, and bone tissue. If it persists, the irritation can worsen and may even result in a fracture. \"Shin splints appear to be on a continuum of mild to severe problems, with fractures at the severe end,\" says Debbie Craig, PhD, LAT, of Northern Arizona University, who has studied the prevention of MTSS in athletes. 2 Stress fractures are not always preceded by shin splints, though. The characteristic throbbing ache felt along the inner side of the tibia typically occurs after a sudden increase in physical activity. Shin splints tend to affect new runners, but anyone who participates in RESEARCHRESULTS Shin splints\u2014or something worse Medial tibial stress syndrome can signal more serious injury. BY STEPHANIE KRAMER ADOBE STOCK CHIROECO.COM NOVEMBER 14, 2017CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 2930 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COM RESEARCHRESULTS high-impact sports can get them. The main differential is a stress fracture. Though the pain may be similar, the size of the affected site may help identify the injury. With a fracture, the pain tends to be concen - trated in one spot. If the cause is shin splints, the soreness usually involves a more general region. Morning pain is also typical of shin splints, Craig says. The other important diagnosis to rule out is anterior compartment syndrome (ACS). The reason that compartment syndromes develop is related to the anatomy of the lower leg, which is divided into four compartments by dense walls of fascia. In some people, one of the compartments is tight (often the anterior one). During exercise, the muscles swell slightly within the enclosed compartment, cutting off the flow of blood to and from the tissues and causing severe pain.One sign of ACS is its sudden onset. \"With anterior compartment syndrome, people get a sharp pain after running for five to 10 minutes,\" Hare says. \"If they stop and rest, the pain goes away.\" He also notes that ACS generally affects the front outer part of the leg and there is no osseous pain. A thorough examination and careful diagnosis are essential. All three conditions are caused by similar factors, but they must be treated differently. The long-term consequences of ACS are serious, and although rare, refief may require surgical release of the compartment. Treating the cause After ruling out other injuries, the treatment of shin splints is generally unproblematic. The underlying factors that increase the risk of shin splints vary. Yet, because chiropractic focuses on the causes of a condition, as a chiropractor you are uniquely posi - tioned to offer individually tailored care. A peak time for shin splints is during a sudden increase in the inten - sity of physical activity, such as early in the running season or before a race. Running on slopes or hard surfaces may also contribute to the condition. Other factors include tightness in the calf muscles or a short Achilles tendon. Some research has also linked supi - nation or pronation to shin splints, suggesting that rolling over the foot places stress on the muscles along the shinbone, which must work harder to stabilize the feet and ankles. 3 Though studies are inconclusive, overprona - tion and wearing worn-out shoes are among the most common probable causes, Craig says. It is important to check your patients' shoes or refer them to a 32 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COM running specialist. \"People with a history of shin splints need new shoes that are antipronation and absorb shock,\" Craig says. Care should be taken if recommending inserts to runners. \"A lot of orthotics are hard,\" Hare says, \"which is not what a runner needs.\" Easy does it Gradually increasing the intensity and duration of physical activity may help prevent shin splints. To stay inju - ry-free, increase mileage by no more than 10 percent per week. Taking time to warm-up properly and cool down after any workout is another key to prevention. Hare also emphasizes the impor - tance of days off. \"Recovery days are just as important as running days,\" he says. Alternating running with low-impact activities such as swim - ming, biking, or walking can help avoid overuse injuries. Treatment of shin splints rarely requires professional care, but recovery times vary. Using kinesiology tape, wearing compression socks, and icing for a few days can provide relief during recovery. As with any overuse injury, the best treatment for shin splints is rest. Some people may need to take a few days or weeks off. After a longer break, patients should ease back into training. If the pain lasts more than two weeks, Hare advises putting the patient in touch with a physician. Additional tests Patients with recurrent pain may need to undergo further tests. \"The difficulty is that by the time symp-toms appear the damage has already been done,\" Craig says. If a fracture is suspected, a leg X-ray should be obtained. A crack in the bone is not always visible, though, especially if the injury is recent. The final diagnosis may require a bone scan. Fortunately, most cases of shin splints are self-limiting. With prompt treatment and prevention, you can help your patients recover faster and get up to speed.

They can take your practice to the next level with smiling faces, positive atti - tudes, and patient relationships, or drag it down with lousy attitudes, low motivation, lacking the vision you want for your practice. Your team can either help or hinder, and the type of team you put together is up to you. So, how can you make sure you've got the right people for your office?Your most important task The importance of having a good team cannot be overstated, and although you've developed many other skills in your effort to build a successful practice, hiring the right people is easily your most important managerial task. Even Steve Jobs was a renowned hirer, never dele - gating this critical task, and always emphasizing the seriousness of hiring those who were going to further his vision, not drag it down. He famously said that he only wanted those \"A\" candidates who could run circles around the other \"B-\" and \"C-grade\" candidates. Similarly, the Container Store specifically searches for the one employee who can do the work of three. It's not a new idea, and it doesn't mean that these companies are mistreating and unfairly over - working their employees, but that people who are purposefully engaged and passionate about what they are doing will automatically (and seemingly effortlessly) do the work of many. When employees don't understand and share your vision, they won't care enough to do quality, efficient work. Find the right fit Hiring quality employees and retaining them is your most important job as a manager. BY NANCY SINGLETONADOBE STOCK CHIROECO.COM NOVEMBER 14, 2017CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 3536 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COM PRACTICECENTRAL Make your vision known It is often said that employee turnover is one of the most expensive things in business, so it is imperative that you find the right people with the right fit who will stay around and help build your practice. This starts with your description of the open position, the description of the person you are looking for, and the questions you ask while interviewing. Start by answering these questions for yourself: u\u0007Why does my practice exist? What is its purpose? uWhat do I care most about? uWhat is my vision for my practice? Once you've got these answers, gear your job descriptions and inter -view questions toward them. Make it visible in the office and apparent in your actions. If you're clear about what you are doing and what you want your practice to look like, your prospective employees will reveal if and how they buy into that vision. Businesses with a purpose are more successful, and hiring people with your purpose in mind will make a difference in those you hire. Their vision must align with yours. If they have no interest in getting chiro - practic adjustments, they may not be the right fit. If you also have nutritional coun - seling in your office, but they are not interested in nutrition, move on. Their wellness values must align with your wellness values. This is also where it is particularly important to consider soft skills, like interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence. If employees cannot express themselves effectively, voice concern appropriately, learn new skills with eagerness, or engage with others, their other hard skills and experience won't matter. You may want to have them interview you, too, since the questions they ask will give you good insight into their soft skills and character. Once hired, appreciate them After you find the right people, find the right fit for them. That means putting them in the position in your practice where they'll shine. They may be a great \"face\" of the practice (front desk\u2014where patients like to see a Businesses with a purpose are more successful, and hiring people with your purpose in mind will make a difference in those you hire. 38 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COM familiar person), or perhaps they would keep your insur - ance billing running like a well-oiled machine. Maybe they would be great at patient therapy. Get to know which person's skills fit in each place in your office. Then, once you've got them in the right place, appreciate and recognize the things they do well. Too often, you can fall into the trap of focusing on problems and not celebrating the wins. In your office, consider putting out a box for compli - ments. If one employee notices another one doing something great, they can write a note, stick it in the box, and you can recognize them during your weekly staff meetings. It can be highly motivating for people to hear that they are appreciated and recognized, and that can help them to continue doing a great job. Sit down with each employee regularly to get their input and make sure you're on the same page. They're on the front lines in your practice, and they have valuable information and observations. Listen to them without an agenda \u2014carefully. Try to laugh about things together; when staff and employers can talk and bond, the practice will grow precisely because the work environment is pleasant and comfortable. Employees will treat patients the way they are treated, so help them understand that you value them, their work, their input, and their efforts. Give them well-defined protocols so that they know what they are supposed to be doing. Then inspect what you expect. Let them know that what they've done is good, and then show them how it might be great. When they hit their goals, be generous. Rewards go a long way toward motivating employees to continue achieving successes. Take your time You can't rush a good hiring process. Finding the right people to help you grow your practice can be time consuming and expensive, but well worth the wait if the person is exactly who you need; high turnover is more expensive than taking the time to find the right hire. Don't hire the first person to come along, and you certainly shouldn't hire people you can't fire, like friends and family. Obligatory relations with employees tend to lead to strained relationships and bad business. Patients can sense the atmosphere in your office, so make it a posi-tive one.

BY BRIAN TORCHIN As baseball season winds to a close, a handful of elite teams have distin - guished themselves by clinching post-season berths. Among other things, they have managed to sustain, over the course of a long season, that important balance where everyone, players and coaching staff alike, understands their roles. They comple - ment one another, both on the field and off. This has assured them a shot at the ultimate goal of winning on the grandest stage of their profession. In a similar way, every physician's office has its own culture and set of ethics. Each one employs staff with a variety of temperaments, and skillsets. Like highly touted prospects, some will deliver\u2014and others will not. Some will assimilate into the broader culture of the practice, and some will alienate themselves from it (nowhere on the hiring sheet is there a box for \"plays well with others\"). You thought you assembled the best practice staff possible. You employed a rigorous hiring process to bring the best talent onboard, but now it has become obvious that one or two aren't working out. Here are some things to keep in mind when faced with staff firings. Be present Many (if not most) physicians stay as far away from the termination process as possible. Doctors usually lack the human-resource (HR) training and finesse necessary for this kind of situation anyway. But there are also upsides to being present at the firing of an employee. As the leader of your practice, your presence can highlight for this particular staff member how serious the matter is, and how difficult it was to make the decision to fire them. A head doctor's presence also adds a sense of finality to the decision. No appeal, no second meeting. This is it. \"You're fired.\"A doctor can also view a staff termination meeting as a learning experience. You've heard countless times that your practice is a business, and this is just another aspect of running one. Admittedly, you are not expected to perform this duty regularly. If your administrator or office manager will be doing the talking and handling the finer points of HR management, then you won't be performing anything at all. Your presence enforces their authority, strengthens your resolve in breaking difficult news to someone, and extends a level of respect to the employee. A fine line There is no law stating that you must be present during the dismissal of a staff member. Depending on the size and scope of your practice, it may make more sense to leave the unfor - tunate task to your office manager and CA. But whether you choose to ADOBE STOCK 40 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COM42 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COMPRACTICECENTRAL be in the room or not, as the leader of your practice it is up to you to enforce certain guidelines for this situation\u2014especially the kind of language used. Be as professional as possible and avoid defensive tactics. Your staff member did not perform their duties adequately or violated some trust. They became a liability. They may ask for a detailed description of why they are losing their job. You can do this if you choose. However, neither you nor your office manager should feel the need to validate the decision or assuage your feelings of guilt. This can quickly degenerate into the \"blame game,\" which will only lead to hostility. There is a fine line to walk here. You want to treat this employee with the respect they deserve while executing the will of your practice. Unless it becomes necessary, avoid escorting them off the property. Let them gather their effects and leave without incident. This ensures that, while their pride and confidence may be shaken, their dignity remains intact. Dodge the bullet No, we are not suggesting you ignore legitimate business reasons for firing a bad employee out of sympathy\u2014or even fear. But you can avoid the slings and arrows of termination if you acutely examine your current rubric for hiring. Hire small; fire small. What is it that your practice really needs? Expectations and job responsi - bilities should be outlined clearly and concisely, and new hires should be given the benefit of an orientation. There are measures you can take to ensure that employees don't fall through the cracks. Be accessible. Encourage feedback. And when possible, create opportunities for their professional growth.

W hile the Fountain of Youth has yet to be found, it is known that the human body holds clues to a person's longevity. Components at the cellular level play roles, including telomeres, meth - ylation, and mitochondria. Telomeres are repeating sequences found at the ends of chromosomes, which protect them from deterioration. Without telomeres, DNA would be suscep - tible to extensive damage, says Adam Killpartrick, DC, CNS. \"Think of telomeres as the plastic tips on the ends of shoelaces that prevent them from fraying,\" says James Antos, DC, DABCO. \"Picture DNA as two long strings wrapped around each other, and at the end of each strand are telomeres.\" Each person is born with a certain length of telomere. \"Each time a cell replicates and makes a copy of itself, telomeres get shorter,\" Killpartrick says. \"Ultimately, they will stop repli - cating, leaving the DNA susceptible to damage and causing reduced function - ality and aging of cells. Stress, smoking, poor diet, and lack of exercise speed up the aging process because they can also shorten telomeres.\" People start to get serious illnesses and die when telomeres are shortened to a certain length. \"It is believed that the longer your telomeres are, the better you're able to resist disease and the longer you'll live,\" Antos says. \"In fact, measuring the length of telo - meres may be a way to predict how long someone will live.\" One possible way to preserve and rebuild telomere length is with a Chinese herb called astragalus. \"The problem with this is, if you purchase it, you have no way of knowing if you are really getting it and at the right potency,\" Antos says. \"There are a lot of sharks in the water when it comes to selling this product.\" Another key cellular component in the aging process is methyla - tion. Methylation is the addition or removal of a methyl group to a chemical compound. \"Methylation is important for a host of biochemical reactions in the body,\" Killpartrick says. It is important for enzyme func - tion, immune function, hormone function, and detoxification. Methylation occurs in the region of genes that regulate their expression, turning them on or off. This regu-lation plays a key role in the aging process. Over time, this regulation becomes less efficient, resulting in aging symptoms. As with telomeres, stress, smoking, poor diet, and lack of exercise can expedite this process. Joseph S. Bird, Jr., MD, assis- tant professor at the University of Tennessee College of Medicine, adds that the healthy function of methyla - tion is believed to limit the presence of diseases such as heart disease, stroke, dementia, depression, infer -tility, cancer, autism, and migraine headaches. Killpartrick notes that mitochon - dria are the powerhouses of a cell and produce the majority of cellular energy. \"In the process of producing energy, they also produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, cells, and tissues,\" he says. \"Although mitochondria have natural processes to help prevent free radicals from causing damage, as people age these processes become less efficient and damage starts to occur.\" And this leads to even further decreased efficiency. \"If someone has good metabolism, youthfulness, and high energy, it's a good sign that their mitochondria are performing well,\" Antos says. Diet, exercise, and hormones Diet and exercise are strongly indi - cated as the best strategies for aging adults to manage their health. The benefits extend down to the cellular level. \"Many nutrients required for crucial functions of telomeres, meth - ylation, and mitochondria come from our diet,\" Killpartrick says. Nutrients available in supplemental form can support cellular processes. For instance, the enzyme responsible for the functionality of telomeres is supported by Astragaloside IV, curcumin, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids. Methylation is supported by the biologically active form of folic acid, L-methylfolate (5-MTHF), Secrets to healthy aging You can promote longevity, but beware of shortcuts.

These nutrients act as precursors for enzymes, quench free radicals, and help donate methyl groups to ensure proper cellular function. Conversely, not only does an unhealthy diet (i.e., one high in saturated fat and low in fruits and vegetables) not provide these necessary nutrients, it can actually increase stress on cellular pathways and increase damage, promoting premature aging.\" Bird points out that exercise promotes healthy cellular func - tion. The type of exercise matters as well. A recent study by Mayo Clinic researchers published in Cell Metabolism found that high inten- sity interval training (HIIT) had the greatest impact on mitochondrial function. 1 This function was increased by nearly 70 percent over a 12-week program. According to the study, only HIIT and combined training improved aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. \"HIIT reversed many age-related differ - ences in the proteome, particularly of mitochondrial proteins in concert with increased mitochondrial protein synthesis,\" the authors wrote. HIIT involves alternating short periods of intense anaerobic exercise with less intense recovery periods. \"This type of variation intensity stimulates the body's physiology differently than if you simply pedal on a stationary bike for 30 minutes,\" Killpartrick explains. \"The body always aims to be efficient and will quickly adapt to repetitive, monoto - nous exercises. And when the body is efficient, it doesn't burn as much fat, stimulate as much hormone produc - tion, or stimulate mitochondria.\" Scott J. Heun, DC, CCSP, says exer- cise has a profound impact on healthy living. In the aging population, the key elements to health involve func - tion and balance. One of the leading causes of death in people over age 70 are complications associated with falls. Therefore, regaining and then main - taining core strength and balance are essential elements in health recovery. \"Many clinical studies support high intensity, short duration exercise for improving the strength and mass of muscle and bone,\" Heun says. \"On a cellular level, optimum structural loading stimulates a growth-and-re - pair response that fortifies bone over time. High intensity isometric loading is the safest way to create loading, and in turn, this loading also induces myofibril proliferation.

Foods high in antioxidant proper - ties include blueberries, cranberries, strawberries, spinach, kale, and Brussels sprouts. Foods high in anti-inflammatory properties, which are also ideal, include green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, and collards; certain nuts such as almonds; fatty fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids; as well as fruits such as blueberries. \"It's important to eat these foods, because chronic inflammation is implicated in every major degenerative disease,\" Killpartrick says. \"The bottom line is that a diet high in vegetables, healthy fats, and lean protein with limited fruits is the best way to go,\" he continues. \"Limiting refined sugar, hydrogenated fat, and processed foods is essential. Sugars elevate blood sugar levels, disrupt hormones\u2014specifically insulin\u2014and stress major organs such as the liver, heart, and brain. Hydrogenated fats compete with omega-3 fats for space in the cell membrane, and can cause cell death.\" What's more, processed foods generally lack nutritive value and can irritate the gut lining. They tend to alter the balance of sugar and hormone levels, causing obesity and hypertension, which negatively affect the aging process. While Antos recommends eating fruit, he says moderation is warranted as fruits are high in fructose. Other good choices include green vege - tables; grains such as quinoa, oats, barley, and spelt; rice; beans; and nuts like walnuts and almonds. Drinking lots of water is also key. \"In general, Americans do not drink enough water,\" he says. Adults should drink 50 to 100 ounces per day, depending on their size. Antos also suggests consuming dairy with caution\u2014although yogurt is OK. Consume most calories earlier in the day, and after 3 or 4 p.m. it's best to eat lighter. \"Eating a late meal or munching at night wreaks havoc on the digestive system,\" he says. \"Your digestive system needs time to relax. Also, you may not feel hungry when you wake up and skip breakfast.\" Bird says a healthy diet includes a balance of organic whole foods in a combination of protein, fats, and complex carbohydrates that prevent 48 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COMunnecessary glucose spikes that induce a hyperinsulinemic environ - ment. There is increasing scientific evidence that exposure to inorganic compounds (e.g., pesticides) has a severe impact on health. \"The general public has picked up on this concept and made food retailers conform to organic food options. The importance of mixing whole food combinations to control glucose spikes in the blood - stream and prevent chronic elevations in insulin is best understood through the medical conditions of hyperin - sulinemia and metabolic syndrome,\" Bird says. And elevated insulin levels create a cascade of metabolic changes that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and cancer. The importance of exercise Cellular processes require energy that comes from mitochondria. When you exercise, you condition your mitochondria to produce more energy with less stress, and produce fewer damage-causing free radicals, which slows down the aging process. As mitochondria function more effi - ciently, telomere functions and meth - ylation also occur more efficiently. \"All three functions are tied together; improving the function of one will affect the other two positively and promote healthy aging,\" Killpartrick says. While exercise is good and associ - ated with health benefits and slowed aging, aerobic exercises (activities that increase heart rate) are the best for improving mitochondrial function. \"The key is to do a variety of exercise types to help the body stay balanced in all four categories: strength, balance, flexibility, and aerobic fitness. \"Improved fitness in any of these categories helps improve mental and physical wellbeing and reduces premature aging,\" Killpartrick says. He also recommends suspension training, such as TRX, noting that those units can be used for HIIT workouts. The TRX device is a Y-shaped canvas strap anchored to a wall or over a closed door. It uses the user's own weight to work targeted muscle groups and also helps with range of motion, making it easy to work into rehabilitation routines. \"This works isolated muscles and rehabilitates and strengthens the spine and extremities,\" Killpartrick says. \"When combined with spinal adjust - ments, the postural improvements have consistently been impressive.\" The aforementioned Mayo Clinic study also looked at strength training and combination strength training and cycling without HIIT. \"These forms of exercise had limited to no impact on mitochondria function,\" CHIROECO.COM NOVEMBER 14, 2017CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 49Bird says. \"Given these findings, HIIT offers the most efficient results for the time committed.\" With regard to cardiovascular health, Heun says many studies have demonstrated that high intensity, short duration training is superior to low-level forms of exercise. A shorter form of training also has the added benefit of preserving joints when contrasted with longer duration forms of exercise such as jogging, rowing, and cycling. Don't sit too much Another thing to keep in mind when looking to age healthfully is to be active and burn calories. \"Americans sit too much,\" Antos says, and Killpartrick concurs. \"Reduce prolonged periods of sitting, even if you get enough exercise,\" he says. Prolonged sitting can pose significant musculoskeletal issues, and is also associated with a variety of degen - erative diseases such diabetes, heart disease, and stroke as well as prema - ture aging. \"Get up and walk around every hour or so to promote healthy circulation and vascular health.\" An additional recommendation from Killpartrick is to increase time spent outdoors. \"Aside from the posi - tive mental health benefits, sunlight helps the body produce vitamin D, which reduces inflammation and improves mitochondrial function along with reducing excess stress on all other organ systems in the body,\" he says. According to a CDC report, 8 percent of Americans have low vitamin D levels. 2 Hormone levels are vital It's important to work toward supporting healthy production of key hormones that are essential during the aging process. Bird believes that proper hormone support to youthful levels in the reproductive, thyroid, and growth hormone systems augments and accentuates the effects of good diet and exercise on telomeric length as well as methylation and mitochondrial function. \"If you leave one of these areas unsupported, the impact on the healthy aging process will suffer,\" he says. Antos is convinced that if men and women age 40 and older could keep their hormone levels balanced and not depleted, their health would be better. For men, this includes testosterone and to some degree estrogen, and for women this includes progestogen, estrogen, and to some extent testosterone. \"I recommend getting hormone levels tested and consulting with a professional if you need supplementation,\" he says. \"If you keep them balanced, you'll be healthier and also look and feel better.\" Similarly, Bird views healthy aging as a combination of a healthy diet, effective exercise, and proper hormonal support. \"Just like a three-legged stool, you will lose stability and affect the healthy aging process if one leg is missing,\" he says.

BY ADRIA SCHMEDTHORST, DC Chiropractic care can be valuable to athletes and sports teams, from preventa - tive care to acute injury treatment. But many practices don't understand how to market to athletes. Here's a nine-step plan to market your chiro - practic practice to this special popu - lation and generate a steady stream of patients. No. 1: Know your target audience. In marketing to athletes, you can take one of two approaches. Consider targeting your efforts to a particular sport or activity. For example, if you live in a state like Colorado, you might focus on conditions related to skiing or snowboarding. Or, you can take a broader health and fitness approach if your community supports multiple types of sports. This is a good idea in a community that has activities like football, basketball, swim meets, soccer, cycling, and marathons ongoing throughout the year. Once you know your audience, you can better tailor your approach to fit their needs. No. 2: Hold lectures and educational events. Give presentations for select youth, high school, and college athletes as well as their coaches and parents. You can also present at local sports clubs and gyms. Talk about how to take care of injuries, work out smart, eat healthy, and improve athletic performance. After the session, hang around to answer questions. The people you talk to may not have an immediate need for your services, but you can be sure that they will remember you when they do. No. 3: Get involved in local sports. If you have any local sports teams in your area (and you probably do), the easiest way to increase the number of athletes visiting your office is to get involved with them. Introduce yourself to the coaches. Give them your cell number so they can reach you quickly in the event of an injury to themselves or one of their athletes. Attend team meetings, like preseason meetings where players and parents discuss team require - ments. You'll be seen as an expert and parents and players will look to you ADOBE STOCK CHIROECO.COM NOVEMBER 14, 2017CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 5354 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COMMARKETINGMATTERS when an injury occurs. Volunteer to be a team physician and stand on the sidelines at games. Not only will you be available to help with acute injuries, but athletes will refer their teammates, and you'll gain exposure to parents and the broader community who attend the games. No. 4: Offer preseason physicals. Offering a free or discounted preseason physicals to athletes not only helps their parents' pocketbooks but it introduces you to them so they will remember your practice when they need chiropractic care. If you opt to charge for the physical, you can offer to donate the proceeds back to the school's athletic department to build even more goodwill. No. 5: Form partnerships. Your practice doesn't exist in a vacuum. Athletes who need chiropractic care may also need the services of physical therapists, athletic trainers, massage therapists, and orthopedic surgeons. Build relationships with these professionals so that when an athlete arrives in their office in need of a referral, your practice is top of mind. No. 6: Use direct mail. Connect with local teams, clubs, and associations to get targeted mailing lists for your direct mail campaigns. You can create postcards, letters, brochures, and newsletters tailored to the sport and send to all on your list. For example, if your goal is to bring in athletes from your local football team, you can create a postcard with graphics geared toward those athletes, such as a player throwing a pass with a headline, \"Don't let shoulder pain keep you on the sidelines.\" Or if you hope to see more runners in your clinic, you could use a picture they would respond to like someone crossing the finish line with a headline like, \"Don't let foot pain put you at the back of the pack.\"No. 7: Spread the word. Create and post brochures and flyers at local gyms and fitness studios. Be sure that these are specific to the audience you're targeting. You want people who read it to understand the benefits you can give them. No. 8: Use your website. Post educational material on your website to provide athletes and parents with the information they are looking for. Offering free advice builds trust in your local community. Add testimonials to your website as well. When patients read about someone like them who has benefitted from your care, they are more likely to come in. No. 9: Leverage social media. Social media is a valuable tool your practice can't afford to ignore\u2014especially if your goal is to treat more athletes. It allows you to connect to athletes faster and in unique ways not otherwise possible. You can share images, tips, and inspirational quotes. Regularly sharing useful information positions you as an expert at treating athletic injuries and keeps you as their first choice when they need care. Marketing your chiropractic prac - tice to athletes poses a unique set of challenges. Set yourself apart by high - lighting your services, your authority, and your brand. By following the nine steps above, you can customize your marketing efforts and see more athletes\u2014along with higher revenue for your practice.

BY FRANK DARRAS, ESQ. The irony is seldom lost on chiropractors: You spend years bending, lifting, reposi - tioning, and manipulating patients to ease their pain. But in turn, these activities can wreak havoc on your own body and mind, which can ulti - mately lead to a disability. Unfortunately, the high risk of disability due to sickness or accident in the chiropractic profession has led to a historically high volume of claims, and chiropractors are a diffi - cult underwriting risk for insurance companies. But that doesn't mean you have to settle for a subpar private disability insurance policy. Here are five features you should shop for when you're comparing disability insurance policies. 1. Seek occupation-specific coverage. In today's market, you should not settle for anything less than occupation-specific coverage that specifically protects the education, medical training, and physicality it took to become a licensed chiropractor. The ideal policy should have its own occupation clause that considers you disabled if you cannot perform the material and substantial duties of your occupation. Pay attention to the language surrounding your \"own occupation\" versus \"any occupation\" provisions. Some policies may only provide bene - fits under their own occupation clause for up to 24 months, five years, or 10 years. After that amount of time, the occupation clause kicks in. Many poli - cies provide total disability coverage, but only if you are not working in any other gainful occupation for pay or profit. The \"any occupation\" language states that although you cannot perform the specific duties of your chiropractic profession, your disability does not prevent you from working in another occupation for which you are trained, educated, or suited. This misleading language adds insult to injury by denying you further payment of benefits and forcing you to seek other employment for signifi - cantly less pay. You should also pay close atten - tion to how\u2014and when\u2014the policy defines disability and occupational duties. Insurance companies should be determining your occupation when you become disabled by evaluating how you do the important duties of your profession in time spent or money earned. Your material and substantial duties are likely to change throughout your career. Insurance carriers often incorrectly frame chiro - practors as business owners\u2014because they supervise staff and dispense supplements\u2014instead of focusing on hands-on manipulation, which is their most important duty. ADOBE STOCK CHIROECO.COM NOVEMBER 14, 2017CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 6566 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COMMONEYMANAGEMENT 2. Do not forget total and partial disability coverage. Most people think of total disability when shopping for disability insurance, but chiropractors should also have coverage for partial disability. Statistics show that you are more likely to become partially rather than totally disabled. If you are still able to perform some of the material and substantial duties of your occupation, it will be extremely difficult to collect total disability benefits. Therefore, look for a policy with a residual disability benefit. Without it, your policy becomes all-or-nothing, and if your carrier suggests you can return to work, even with limited hours or duties, you will not be eligible for any benefits. Total disability coverage pays if you cannot perform the primary duties of your occupation, but the residual disability benefit will compensate you for loss of income (usually 20 percent) following the partial loss of your duties or the increased time it takes to complete duties due to impairment. This provision allows you to collect benefits while you work your way back into the practice. For example, if you suffer a heart attack and have to work reduced hours, the residual disability benefit will provide benefits while you continue to work your way back to full-time status. Some policies may also have a recovery benefit that will continue to pay disability benefits if you return to work full time, helping while you rebuild your practice due to lost patients and referral sources. If you are no longer sick or injured but still have a loss of income, this generous provision can help speed up your financial recovery until the loss of income disappears and your financial picture has recovered. 3. Insist upon the future increase option. The future increase rider is a great policy feature for younger chiropractors. This rider guarantees your right to purchase additional disability coverage in the future in exchange for an increased premium. The premium is determined by your age at the time you purchase additional coverage. The guaranteed insurability rider allows you to add more disability protection without requiring you to undergo additional medical under - writing. If you are under 45 years old and foresee income growth in your future, this rider is an excellent way to ensure your coverage increases even if your health declines. Note that additional coverage is usually limited to half the original monthly benefit amount. You must also prove that your earned income meets the insurer's issue limits for 68 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COM additional coverage at the time you exercise the options. 4. Minimize mental health, substance abuse, and self-reported condition limitations. The mental health and substance abuse limitations are among the most restrictive clauses in any given disability insurance policy. Insurers do not like to pay extended benefits for these \"soft\" conditions. Your ideal disability insurance policy would not have these types of limitations and would not have a self-reported condition cap. However, many insurers no longer offer such unrestricted coverage; if they do, it usually comes at a steep price. If you cannot eliminate these limitations, ensure your policy's mental/nervous and substance abuse limitations are not less than 24 months. Chiropractors should also pay special attention to the self- reported condition limitation, which restricts payment of benefits for certain subjective physical disabilities that are not supported by objective medical testing. Conditions like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and even headaches rely on subjective reporting of symp - toms, and the payment of benefits may be limited to a maximum of nine to 24 months. Look for an individual disability policy with no self-reported or other limited condition clause. 5. Ask about the waiver of premium clause. Consider purchasing a waiver of premium option for your life insurance policy. Many chiropractors with a substantial income have life insurance policies, but they often do not add the disability waiver of premium to it. Under this provision, if your disability prevents you from working, your obligation to pay future premiums on your life insurance policy is waived. This is an inexpensive way to protect life insurance coverage from the financial uncertainty often caused by permanent disability. Do not let poor insurance coverage threaten your financial livelihood. If you identify the best features to insure your professional needs, you can find an disability insurance policy that protects your career.

Although chiropractic offices are relatively low-risk work environments, workers can still get sick or hurt on the job. Over the past decade, more than three-quarters (76 percent) of safety complaints about chiropractic offices that were investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) involved alleged health violations. 1 The remaining investigations dealt with potential safety violations. Seventy one percent of all investi - gations were initiated by complaints from either employees or patrons. In almost all instances over the past 10 years, the business owners were not informed of the OSHA inspections before they occurred. To keep workers safe, OHSA mandates that all business owners provide their employees with working conditions that are free from known dangers. 2 Failure to comply with OSHA standards can have serious repercussions. Penalties for viola - tions can be steep, ranging from $12,675 per violation up to 10 times that amount for willful or repeated violations. 3 OSHA prioritizes inspections for high-risk workplaces and those where employees have lodged a formal complaint. However, that does not preclude lower-risk environments from being inspected at any time and for a range of reasons. Even the most meticulous, well-run chiropractic or medical office is a potential candidate for an OSHA inspection. Because an investigation can happen at any time, it is important to be prepared and stay on top of changing regulations. Here are four things to expect during an OSHA inspection: 1. Walk-ins welcome. OSHA is not required to give advance notice of an inspection or an investigation, and it rarely does. In situations presenting imminent danger, OSHA may provide notice to expedite the inspection process and get the hazard addressed immediately. However, in most cases, OSHA will either investigate complaints by phone or dispatch inspectors to conduct an in-person surprise visit. 2. On call. With permission from the complainant, OSHA may call the business to describe the complaint and follow up with requests for written details about the alleged hazards. If an office receives an inquiry from OSHA, it is required to respond in writing within five working days. Potential hazards must be identified in the response along with corrective actions that have been taken to address the issue. If ADOBE STOCKThe importance of proper alignment Four ways to prepare for an OSHA inspection. BY DAVID QUEZADA CHIROECO.COM NOVEMBER 14, 2017CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 7172 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COM LEGALEASE the response is timely and adequate, and the complainant is satisfied with it, OSHA will likely not conduct an on-site inspection. 3. A walk-around is part of the assessment. When an OSHA compliance officer arrives on site for an inspection, he or she will take a tour of the workplace to inspect for potential hazards that could result in an injury or illness. The employer may accompany the compliance officer on the tour and ask questions throughout the inspection. It also is recommended that the employer take detailed notes during this time. The walk-around can take place over several hours, days, or weeks, depending on the nature of the inspection. 4. Making an adjustment. Following the walk-around, the OSHA compliance officer will discuss his or her findings and present any violations, potential fees, and deadlines. The officer also will review solutions that must be implemented to address any identified hazards. If OSHA issues a citation and collects financial penalties, it must do so within six months of the viola-tion's occurrence. Employers have 15 working days to challenge alleged violations and penalties by writing to the OSHA area director. Appeals are reviewed by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. OSHA's primary goal is to main - tain safe working conditions for employees. It offers many resources to help chiropractic offices and other medical businesses identify and remedy potential hazards, and estab - lish effective workplace safety policies. By emphasizing a culture of safety, conducting ongoing safety training, and following OSHA's requirements, you can help keep your employees safe from harm and your practice free from penalties. Additional informa - tion on creating a safe and healthy workplace is available by contacting OSHA or insurance carriers.

Would you like to help people suffering from a chronic, mostly incurable condition? If the answer is yes, then consider creating a peripheral neuropathy niche practice. This Biz Quiz will teach you the basics. A niche practice is a specialty prac - tice that focuses on a particular illness or symptom (e.g., osteoarthritis or hand pain). To be a candidate for a niche practice, certain characteristics are desirable: The number of people afflicted should be large. The illness or symptom should be largely resistant to conventional allopathic treatments, and the disease or symptom should have a marked impact on the patient's quality of life. You should have a unique treat - ment that produces a better result than mainstream medical treatment, it should be safe, and if possible is one supported by bona fide studies in the medical literature. This last require - ment is often difficult to meet as there is little funding available to evaluate most alternative treatments. If that is the case, there should at least be anec - dotal information to support your treatment protocol. What it is Peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating and painful condition that affects the peripheral motor, sensory, and autonomic nerves. Because it affects the autonomic nervous system, it can affect any organ. It is caused by destruction of the protective myelin sheath with a resulting defect in neurotransmission. There are many causes of neurop - athy (infection, metabolic disorder, trauma, to name a few), but the most common cause\u2014and the one you will likely focus on in your office\u2014is diabetes. Common symp - toms that tend to occur in the feet and lower legs consist of burning pain, itching, numbness, tingling, skin discoloration, and ulcers that are difficult to treat and do not heal readily. Additionally, there may be balance defects secondary to loss of proprioception. The mainstay of treatment is to address the underlying illness. Strict monitoring of blood sugar, aggres - sive foot hygiene, and monitoring of insulin levels is essential. The patient's primary care doctor or endocrinol - ogist should take care of this part of treatment. Other than that, ancillary treatment given by neurologists consists of anti - convulsant and antiepileptic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, and pregab - alin. These drugs are largely ineffective Feel the difference Produce better results with a niche practice. BY MARC H.

Many patients can't tolerate them. As mentioned earlier, the most common complaint that neuropathy patients have, the one that brings them to the office seeking help, are the sensations of pain, tingling, numbness, and itching of the feet. These can be so uncomfortable and painful that they impact sleep, which these patients badly need. There is an alternative treatment that is effective for these symptoms, however. That is the cold (or low-level) laser. Using a laser A laser can be especially effective for reducing the pain component of neuropathy but less so for the tingling and numbness of the feet. Patients report improvement in their sleep due to decreased itching and pain. The laser speeds healing time for typical skin ulcers and helps to dry out those that are oozing. Because it is a low-level laser, it is safe to use; you cannot burn the patient. The treatment is simple and involves moving the laser over several affected areas at each treatment session. In many states, the treatment can be done by a technician. You do not need an MD to perform this treatment; it is within the scope of chiropractic (in every state that I am aware of). But although you do not need a medical doctor to perform the treatment, from a marketing standpoint it will make a difference if you have one on staff. Unfortunately, old prejudices die hard, and the sad truth is that most people prefer to be treated by an MD. You will have a higher closure rate from telephone and internet queries if potential patients know an MD is involved. The laser is a great marketing tool because there is a certain cachet about lasers; they project an image that is high-tech, cutting edge, non-invasive, effective, and scientific. Patients can be treated while in a relaxed position and environment and they will look forward to coming in for their treat - ment sessions. The anchor of all your marketing efforts is the internet. Although you'll likely have some competition in most urban and suburban areas, there are still far fewer doctors treating periph - eral neuropathy with lasers than there are mainstream doctors using the standard drug protocols. Go online and check out the competition in your area; get a feel for what they are charging and what their programs entail. Are they MDs? DCs? How long have they been in practice? Knowing the number of doctors in your area that you have to compete with will give you an idea of how 78 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICSNOVEMBER 14, 2017 CHIROECO.COM Test yourself Test your knowledge of developing a niche neuropathy practice with this true and false quiz. 1.

For that reason, hire skilled people to design your website, create your multifaceted marketing plan\u2014which can include Google+, other social media, a blog or newsletter\u2014and a search engine optimization package. The laser makes marketing easier, but you still need to hire pros to make your practice visible and the go-to destination. There are several ways to get reimbursed for laser treatment. The typical plan is two or three treat-ments for several weeks. You can have an \u00e0 la carte price per visit and also offer sessions with advance package discounts. Getting the fee up front more than makes up for any discount you give. Laser treatment is usually not covered by Medicare or private insur - ance, but you can be reimbursed for any physical therapy treatment that goes along with the laser therapy. Be sure to charge everyone the same amount and, if in doubt, speak with your healthcare attorney. In the one peer-reviewed study on this that I am aware of, a relatively low-power laser was used. You do not need a class 4 laser to get started. A class 4 laser will give you shorter treatment times but not necessarily better results. Peripheral neuropathy is a miser - able scourge for more than 20 million people. You can make a difference in their lives and add a huge profit center for your practice by adding laser treatment to your offerings. MARC H.

That concept is timelier than ever, considering the perfect storm devel - oping in conventional health care\u2014a looming shortage of doctors, an aging population, epidemic obesity, skyrocketing health insurance premiums and deductibles, limita - tions on coverage, and an increasing awareness of the relatively high risks of medications and surgeries. As the sky darkens over conven - tional medicine, notice the public's rising awareness of holistic healthcare and vitalism, and their importance for optimum wellness. As evidence, notice the health-related TV shows like Dr. Oz, The Doctors, and the spotlight on chiropractic recently on Dr. Phil. They all make frequent refer- ences to our major premise that real health comes from within. So why aren't patients lining up to see you? There are, no doubt, many complicated reasons ranging from chiropractic's internal identity struggle, remnants of the AMA's destructive campaign, long-ingrained stigmas, and the profession's own self-esteem issues. Because those conditions will not be resolved anytime soon, aim to reach as many\u2014if not everybody\u2014in your community and make them aware of who you are and what you offer. Even BJ Palmer commented over 70 years ago, \"If your business is not worth being advertised; then you should advertise it for sale.\" Help them find you People are looking for a doctor like you and your practice and they are not finding it. They are likely going elsewhere for services you can better provide. Does the idea of striving to reach more people have you feeling a bit of renewed vigor, enthusiasm, and optimism? It should, because many DCs are setting new records in their clinics with marketing as the founda - tion. Of course, providing excellent service is paramount to obtaining a return-on-investment for marketing and sustaining practice growth. What marketing should you do? Everything your budget allows. And keep rotating your strategies to reach different people. Here are a few inex - pensive and productive marketing efforts often overlooked. Your community parade. How would you like to have inexpensive exposure to hundreds if not thousands of families who live within your office's drawing area? You can do that by participating in your town's parade. It's a festive and upbeat atmosphere and you can have fun putting your creative skills to work on designing and building your float or routine. Some DCs even make the front page of their local paper with some - thing as unique as a giant spine costume. The added bonus of building camaraderie comes from involving your staff. Remember to have visible signage highlighting your office location (name a nearby landmark), hand out something they can take home with your name and telephone number (e.g., bent pens, coupons, and fridge magnets), and practice your smile and wave. Community service. Considering the many scandals in the media lately about professionals like bankers, clergy, politicians, and doctors, the public is wondering who can be trusted. Step up and let your integrity shine by participating in community service. Options range from joining a service organization, participating in your community's chamber of commerce and in church functions, teaching health at grade schools, and assisting charitable organizations like a food pantry. Participate with sincerity and gratefulness.
