Policy: Under this non patient-specific standing order, licensed pharmacists and other authorized vaccinators employed by or under contract with a pharmacy and possessing a certificate to administer immunizations by the New York State Education Department who meet and/or have satisfied all applicable requirements to administer vaccination as set forth in law and by Executive Order 202.82, and any other relevant Executive Orders that may extend, modify, add to, or expand upon the provisions in EO 202.82, may administer the Moderna COVID-19 vaccination to individuals age 18 years and older who are eligible for COVID-19 vaccine at the time they are vaccinated, in connection with their employment or contract with said pharmacy, and as permitted by its Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to individuals in accordance with the CDC's Vaccination Program and recommendations issued by ACIP, as well as with any requirements set forth in EO 202.82 and such other relevant Executive Orders. Procedure: 1. Assess persons 18 years of age or older for eligibility for Moderna COVID-19 vaccine based on the following criteria: a. No COVID-19 vaccine: Administer the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine according to the procedure described herein. b. One (1) previous dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine administered 28 or more days prior to the date of vaccine administration: Administer the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine according to the procedure described herein. c. Moderna COVID-19 vaccine should not be administered at the same time as other vaccines. Separate Moderna COVID-19 vaccine from other vaccines by 14 days before or after the administration of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. d. Moderna COVID-19 vaccine should be deferred for at least 90 days for persons who received passive antibody therapy (monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma) as part of COVID-19 treatment in order to avoid interference of antibody therapy with vaccine-induced immune responses. Page 2 of 7 2. Screen for contraindications and precautions a. Contraindications: Do not administer the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to anyone with a known history of: i. a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a prior dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines) or to any vaccine component (including polyethylene glycol) listed in the prescribing information at https://www.fda.gov/media/144637/download ; or ii. immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components (including polyethylene glycol), unless they have been evaluated by an allergist- immunologist and it is determined that the person can safely receive the vaccine; or iii. immediate allergic reaction of any severity to polysorbate, unless they have been evaluated by an allergist-immunologist and it is determined that the person can safely receive the vaccine. b. Precautions: i. In persons who report a history of an immediate allergic reaction (defined as any hypersensitivity-related signs or symptoms such as urticaria, angioedema, respiratory distress, or anaphylaxis that occur within 4 hours following exposure to a vaccine or medication) to any vaccine or injectable therapy (intramuscular, intravenous, or subcutaneous), counsel about the unknown risks of developing a severe allergic reaction and the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, and consider deferral of vaccination until further information on risk of anaphylaxis is available and/or consultation with an allergist-immunologist. This precaution does not apply to allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injectable therapy (e.g., pet, venom, environmental, food, latex or oral medications). ii. Defer administering the Moderna vaccine to people who are moderately to severely ill with an acute illness until they have recovered. 3. Provide information on the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and obtain consent. a. Prior to vaccine administration: i. Inform each patient or or a patient's legal guardian, as applicable, of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. As the vaccination provider, you must communicate to the recipient or their caregiver, information consistent with the \"Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers\" prior to the individual receiving Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, including: (1) FDA has authorized the emergency use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, which is not an FDA-approved vaccine; (2) The recipient or their caregiver has the option to accept or refuse Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine; (3) The significant known and potential risks and benefits of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, and Page 3 of 7 the extent to which such risks and benefits are unknown; and (4) Information about available alternative vaccines and the risks and benefits of those alternatives. ii. Provide each patient or patient's legal guardian, as applicable, a copy of the \"Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers,\" or direct the individual to the website https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/ to obtain the Fact Sheet. iii. Provide the v-safe information sheet to vaccine recipients/caregivers and encourage vaccine recipients to participate in v-safe. V-safe is a new voluntary smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to check in with people who have been vaccinated to identify potential side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. V-safe asks questions that help CDC monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. V-safe also provides second-dose reminders if needed and live telephone follow-up by CDC if participants report a significant health impact following COVID- 19 vaccination. For more information, visit: www.cdc.gov/vsafe . iv. Obtain verbal consent to administer the vaccine from the patient or the patient's legal guardian, as applicable. If verbal consent is received, then document consent in the patient's medication profile or medical record. The New York State Department of Health Screening and Consent Form, which is optional, also is available on the Department of Health COVID- 19 Vaccination Program webpage for providers at https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov . b. Provide necessary information on receiving the second dose of vaccine. i. When administering the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, provide a vaccination card to the recipient or their caregiver with the location and date in 28 days when the recipient needs to return for the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. 4. Storage and Handling of Vaccine a. The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine multiple-dose vial contains a frozen suspension that does not contain a preservative. Consult CDC, NYSDOH and Moderna guidance on storage and handling of Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. b. Moderna COVID-19 vaccines must be thawed prior to administration. Only thaw the number of vials that you believe you will need. Thawed vials cannot be refrozen. Each multi-dose vial contains enough suspension for ten patients. c. Thawing under refrigeration: Thaw in the refrigerator between 2 C to 8 C (36 F to 46 F) for 2 hours and 30 minutes. After thawing, let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before administering. Vials can be in the refrigerator for up to 30 days prior to first use. d. Thawing at room temperature: Vials will thaw at room temperature between 15 C to 25 C (59 F to 77 F) in 1 hour. Unpunctured vials may be stored between 8\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (46\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) for up to 12 hours. Do not thaw a vial at room temperature unless you are prepared to vaccinate 10 persons within 12 hours. Page 4 of 7 e. Do not refreeze vials once thawed. 5. Prepare to administer vaccine a. Moderna COVID-19 vaccine vials do not contain preservatives. Strict adherence of aseptic technique during administration must be followed. b. Ensure the vaccine vial has thawed to room temperature prior to administration. If a vial feels cold to the touch, then it has not thawed enough. c. Swirl vial gently after thawing and between each withdrawal. Do not shake. Do not dilute the vaccine. d. Inspect the liquid in the vial prior to administration. The liquid is a white to off- white suspension and may contain white or translucent particulates. Do not use if liquid is discolored or if other particles are observed. Notify the NYSDOH at 1- 800-543-7468 if you need to discard vaccine. e. Visually assess patient weight and select a needle for vaccine administration based on the following chart: Patient Ge nder Patient Weight Needle Length Female < 130 lbs 5/8* - 1\" 130-152 lbs 1\" 153-200 experts recommend a 5/8-inch needle for men and women who weigh less 130 pounds. If used, skin must be stretched tightly ( do not bunch subcutaneous tissue ). f. Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic swab, and withdraw 0.5 mL of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. g. After the first dose has been withdrawn, the vial should be held between 2\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F). Record the date and time of first use on the Moderna COVID- 19 Vaccine vial label. Discard vial after 6 hours. Do not refreeze. 6. Administer vaccine a. Visually inspect each dose in the dosing syringe prior to administration. i. Verify the final dosing volume of 0.5 mL. ii. Confirm there are no particulates and that no discoloration is observed. iii. Do not administer if vaccine is discolored or contains particulate matter. iv. Call the manufacturer and the NYSDOH if the vaccine is discolored or contains particulate matter. b. Administer the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, 0.5 mL, in the deltoid muscle via the intramuscular (IM) route. 7. Document vaccination Page 5 of 7 Document each patient's vaccine administration information and follow-up in the following places: Medical Record System: Ensure that the patient's name, the date the vaccine was administered, the name of the vaccine, the manufacturer and lot number, the vaccination site and route, address of administering site, and the name and title of the pharmacist administering the vaccine, the publication date of the EUA fact sheet and the date it was given to the patient is documented in the patient's medication profile. In instances where a patient medication profile is not required, this information must be recorded on a separate form retained by the pharmacist who has administered the immunization, and in a retrievable format available to the State Education Department and the patient. If vaccine was not administered, record the reason(s) for non-receipt of the vaccine (e.g., medical contraindication, refusal). Documentation must be completed within 12 hours of administration. This information, whether in a patient medication profile or separately kept, must be recorded and maintained in accordance with 8 NYCRR section 29.2 (a) (3). Signed Certificate of Immunization (given to the patient) : Record the patient's name, date of vaccination, name/location of the administering clinic, administering nurse, name of vaccine, manufacturer and lot number, and recommendations for future immunizations. New York State Immunization Information System (NYSIIS) and City Immunization Registry (CIR): Report all doses administered to NYSIIS or CIR within 12 hours of administration. 8. Management of medical emergencies Observe all patients for a minimum of 15 minutes following vaccination to monitor for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions. Observe patients with a history of anaphylaxis for 30 minutes following vaccination. Be prepared for management of a medical emergency related to the administration of vaccine by maintaining written copies of the standing orders and protocols for administration of epinephrine and diphenhydramine. RNs shall be responsible for having emergency anaphylaxis treatment agents, related syringes and needles at the immunization site, including at least 3 epinephrine prefilled syringes or autoinjectors, H1 antihistamine, blood pressure cuff, and a stethoscope and timing device to assess pulse. To prevent syncope, vaccinate patients while they are seated or lying down and assess for signs of syncope such as extreme paleness, sweating, coldness of the hands and feet, nausea, lightheadedness, dizziness, weakness or visual disturbances.
