Your field can include your emotional, energetic, mental, spiritual or physical body, and your environment\u2014whether it's your home, office, or other physical space. [Stagnant or negative energy](https://chopra.com/articles/how-shifting-your-energy-can-transform-your-life) can have extremely detrimental effects on your mental and physical state and is even believed to manifest into things like a lack of happiness and success as well as pain and disease. Smudging can help combat this negativity, clear the energy in your field, and help you start anew. Smudging is an ancient ceremony in which you burn sacred plants, such as sage, to allow the smoke to clear and bless a space. To get some insight into the ancient art of smudging, Native American healer and singer Grandmother Wapajea Walks on Water\u2014with lineage from the Choctaw, Creek and Cherokee tribes\u2014sheds some light on the topic. Grandmother Wapajea says, \"The goal of smudging is to make a place clear of lingering energy that is different from what you may be intending for that space. You want to prepare the space for ceremony, the way you would clean your house, cook, and decorate when your family comes for a holiday. We are welcoming Great Spirit, angels, and ancestors to come and share clean space with us as well.\" What you use to clear a space depends on your location and what plants you have access to. Grandmother Wapajea says that people on the East Coast use tobacco, cedar, sweet grass, juniper, pine needles, deerstongue, cypress, and sage. Out west they use tobacco, pinion, desert sage, and sweet grass. \"My family uses sage and cedar to purify, tobacco to send our prayers to the Chihowa, and sweet grass to attract angels and sweet-spirited ancestors. We also use sweet grass to bring ease to a space when we need to discuss something that is difficult to say,\" Grandmother Wapajea says. For indigenous people Great Spirit is in all of nature and creation, each thing representing a different aspect of divinity and sacredness. Therefore they honor the elements, and all natural things, from plants and minerals, to animals and people. Often, smudging involves a four-direction ceremony. Here's a guide to help you get started.

May your heart be cleansed, that you might hear its messages clearly. May your throat be cleansed, that you might speak rightly when words are needed.
