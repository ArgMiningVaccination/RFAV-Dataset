Due to the many essential functions bones provide, it is important that bone health is maintained. Occasionally, bone problems occur, and a person may need to seek help from a doctor that specializes in bones. Bone doctors, also known as skeleton doctors, are specialists who treat bone and joint disorders, such as fractures, arthritis, scoliosis, cancer of the bone, and bone diseases. There are three main types of bone doctors, which include orthopedists, podiatrists, and chiropractors. Orthopedists Orthopedists are doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of serious bone and joint issues. The word orthopedic is derived from the Greek language; ''ortho,'' meaning straight or erect, and ''ped,'' meaning child. The orthopedics field was originally established to treat children with skeletal deformities; however, orthopedists now treat people of all ages. A person may consult with an orthopedist for various reasons, such as a fractured bone, chronic pain, a decrease in range of motion, inability to stand or walk, or a serious soft tissue injury. Orthopedists treat a variety of bone related conditions, which include osteoporosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, muscular dystrophy, arthritis, tennis elbow, and bone tumors. Orthopedists have many duties and responsibilities. In addition to diagnosing and treating various bone and joint issues, orthopedists are involved in the rehabilitation of a patient following a serious injury or surgical procedure. Pain and swelling in the joints may occur due to certain bone issues, limiting a person's range of motion. When this occurs, the orthopedist will develop a plan to help the patient regain their range of motion. The plan may include physical therapy or require surgical treatment. Orthopedists are also involved in the development of care plans to prevent injuries or bone diseases from worsening. Some orthopedists are also surgeons, performing a variety of surgical procedures that involve bones, joints, tendons, ligaments, and muscles. Often, orthopedic surgeons will specialize in a specific area of the body. For example, some orthopedic surgeons only deal with the hands and wrists, whereas others only specialize in joints. Joint replacement surgeries are common, especially among people with forms of arthritis. Approximately one million joint replacements are performed each year in the United States. To perform a joint replacement, the orthopedic surgeon will remove the injured joint and replace it with a prosthetic joint. Furthermore, bone fractures may also require surgical treatment. To perform bone fracture repair, the orthopedic surgeon sets the bone back into place using metal screws, pins, rods, or plates, which may be temporary or permanent. Bone fracture repair can be internal, which means the hardware used to set the bone in place is inside of the body, or it can be external, which means that the hardware is attached to a stabilizing device on the outside of the body.
