Pablo Penaloza-MacMaster, PhD, an assistant professor of Microbiology-Immunology at Feinberg, discusses work in his lab that could lead to better vaccines and treatments for coronaviruses. \"This is not the first and likely not the last pandemic that we'll have. We have been exploring how we can make vaccines not only more effective against SARS-CoV-2 but potentially cross-protective, even against other coronaviruses.\" \u2014 [Pablo Penaloza-MacMaster, PhD](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=34799) - Assistant Professor of [Microbiology-Immunology](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/microbiology-immunology/) - Member of Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS) - Member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center Episode Notes - Penaloza-MacMaster emphasized the need for all eligible people to get vaccinated to prevent disease and death, long-term complications and variants that are more transmissible or virulent. - Penaloza-MacMaster's lab works to make vaccines better. His lab's area of focus is chronic infection, such as HIV. Since the pandemic began, his team has pivoted to utilize their toolkits and expertise to study SARS-CoV-2. - hen it comes to viral infections, especially with SARS-CoV-2, \"What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.\" All the long-term complications of contracting COVID-19 aren't yet known, but evidence shows chronic fatigue, brain fog and even neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and psychosis are occurring. - While the current vaccines do prevent severe disease and death, he says no vaccine is 100 percent perfect and infections in vaccinated people are not unexpected. - For this study in Cell Reports,one of the most abundantly expressed proteins in a coronavirus. Once someone develops an infection, the virus starts expressing at very high levels, very early during the lifecycle. His team hypothesized that it was a good target for T-cell responses. - If in future studies the combination vaccine proves to be safe, immunologic and effective in non-human primate models, that may provide a rationale for exploring this concept further in human trials. - \"The study of antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and and functions\" [published](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24418573/)in Antiviral Research Subscribe to Feinberg School of Medicine podcasts here: Recorded August 27, 2021.
