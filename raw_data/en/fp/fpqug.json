What is Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Acupuncture involves inserting extremely fine, sterile needles into specific points on the body. There are 2,000 acupuncture points according to Traditional Chinese medicine. These points are connected by meridians or energetic pathways. Energy or Qi (pronounced \"chee\" which means vital energy), flows through the body using these pathways. In a healthy body, Qi (vital energy) flows freely. Pain, lack of function, or illness are signs that Qi has been disrupted. National Institutes of Health ( [NIH](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/)) studies have shown that acupuncture is an effective treatment alone or in combination with conventional therapies to treat the following: - Insomnia [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156618/) - Chronic Pain - Nausea - Addiction [Headaches](https://advancedwellnesssolutions.com/2020/07/22/gentle-chiropractic-care-for-headaches/) - Menstrual cramps - Tennis elbow [Fibromyalgia](https://advancedwellnesssolutions.com/2020/08/11/gentle-chiropractic-care-for-fibromyalgia/) - Myofascial pain - Osteoarthritis - Knee pain - Low back pain [Neck pain](https://advancedwellnesssolutions.com/2015/06/03/neck-pain-and-whiplash/) [Carpal tunnel syndrome](https://advancedwellnesssolutions.com/2020/02/04/you-should-know-carpal-tunnel-syndrome/) - Asthma Benefits of Acupuncture One of the biggest benefits of acupuncture is that it has very few adverse side effects. Meanwhile, many widely accepted western medical procedures used to treat the same conditions have serious side effects. For example, acupuncture is commonly used to address chronic musculoskeletal pain [2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1357513). The widely accepted western medicine treatments for chronic pain can have serious, sometimes addictive side effects. According to NICDC, \"The evidence supporting these [western medicine] therapies is no better than that for acupuncture.\" [3] What to Expect Our acupuncturist will talk with you about your health history and perform a physical examination. The frequency and number of treatments differ from person to person. Those with acute symptoms may experience dramatic relief in just a few treatments. Those with chronic or complex health issues can expect it to take longer to see results. The acupuncture treatment begins as you lie comfortably on a treatment table. Most people feel little or no discomfort as the fine sterile needles are gently placed into the skin. Treatment times vary from 5 to 30 minutes. Many patients find acupuncture treatments very pleasant and relaxing. Drug Free Pain Relief Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese medicine have been providing drug free pain relief for thousands of years. It is believed the needles are stimulating the body's central nervous system and activating its natural healing abilities. Dr. Danielle Hurd, DC is delighted to offer residents of Stuart, Palm City and surrounding areas Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine at Advanced Wellness Solutions. "}
