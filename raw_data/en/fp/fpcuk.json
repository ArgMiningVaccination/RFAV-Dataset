Most of your medical doctors will never consider this when looking at your health. Heavy Metal Toxicity is a precursor to other serious health concerns and should be dealt with in a systematic way using the body's natural detoxification pathways. Do not let your Medical Doctor lead you on a wild goose chase looking for all sorts of exotic diseases and reasons for how you feel. One simple test will tell you if you have Heavy Metals. To Request an Action Plan to Address Heavy Metal Toxicity [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Heavy metal toxicity is an excessive build-up of metals in the body. Oftentimes, the vague symptoms produced by heavy metal toxicity are mistakenly misdiagnosed as incurable chronic conditions like [Multiple Sclerosis](multiple-sclerosis.asp). The most common heavy metals that humans are exposed to are aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury. Heavy metals are found in everyday existence and are frequently hard to avoid entirely. Most people can excrete toxic heavy metals from the body successfully. However, some people\u2014especially those who suffer from chronic conditions\u2014cannot excrete them efficiently enough and a build-up occurs. Recent research also reveals that those who cannot excrete heavy metals efficiently appear to be genetically predisposed to this condition. Research has shown that the APO-E 4/3 and 4/4 genotypes are the worst excretors of heavy metals. Those with this version of APO-E protein\u2014abundant in the cerebral spinal fluid surrounding the brain\u2014will have the highest affinity for becoming ill from exposure to neuro-toxic heavy metals, especially mercury when it is present in combination with others. When numerous metals are present in the body, they have a \"synergistic toxicity.\" Dr. Boyd Haley, professor and chair of the chemistry department at the University of Kentucky, performed a study on rats and found that the mortality rate of rats exposed to a small dose of mercury or aluminum killed only 1 rat in 100. However, when the rats were exposed to both mercury and aluminum at the same time, all 100 rats died\u2014a 100% mortality rate. Something to consider when opting to vaccinate your child or yourself, since vaccines contain both the mercury and aluminum in the vaccine. You May Have Heavy Metal Toxicity If You Are Experiencing Any Of These Symptoms: Note: Heavy metal toxicity can produce vague symptoms that sometimes are mistaken for other chronic conditions such as Autism, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, depression, Multiple Sclerosis, and a host of other serious disorders. Discuss heavy metal toxicity with your healthcare professional before receiving any diagnosis or treatment for a serious chronic condition. Heavy Metal Toxicity Can Result From Either Acute or Chronic Exposure to Heavy Metals. Acute Exposure can occur as a result of: Chronic Exposure can occur as a result of not addressing the acute exposure reasons. Medical Diagnosis The following tests and procedures may be helpful in diagnosing Heavy Metal Toxicity and/or other chronic conditions: Medical Treatment DMSA (Succimer) - Brand name Chemet\u00ae. An oral drug used for patients with lead poisoning. This medication will bond with lead and then be dissolved and passed through the urine. It is used for chelating mercury, but many believe it is not the best specific chelator of mercury. Adverse side effects include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and possible liver dysfunction.9 Calcium EDTA (Edetate calcium disodium, ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid) - A chelating agent used mostly for lead. Mildly effective against mercury, arsenic, and gold.10 DMPS - DMPS is the strongest and most specific chelator of mercury. It is 10 times stronger than DMSA. It can be given intravenously or orally, but the newest and best method is transdermally, or through the skin. Trans-dermal DMPS (TD-DMPS) is a cream that is rubbed onto the underside of the arms and absorbed into the bloodstream. Dr. Rashid A. Buttar's TD-DMPS protocol has cured Autistic patients.11 One significant aspect of Dr. Buttar's protocol is that TD-DMPS can be applied every other day. IV and oral-use DMPS do not allow for such frequent treatments, and therefore do not as effectively promote the constant flushing of mercury and other heavy metals.

Conventional and Prescription Medications Detoxification therapy for heavy metal toxicity may take a great deal of time (think months or even years) for the complete removal of all heavy metals from the body. In addition, some detoxification methods may have numerous adverse side effects as the metals are stirred up and flushed out of the body. The most popular method is chelation therapy, which uses agents\u2014either intravenously, transdermally, or orally\u2014to draw out heavy metals by binding to them and eliminating them in fecal waste or urine. Chelation therapy is used by both conventional and alternative healthcare professionals. Conventional medicines can be prescribed in order to assist the body in heavy metal detoxification. These medicines may cause depletion of certain nutrients. Following is a list of common conventional medicines that may be used for heavy metal toxicity: Note: Because TD-DMPS diminishes the necessary minerals and trace minerals from the body, our Essential Blend Multi Mineral was specially designed to be used on the TD-DMPS \"off-days.\" [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You Over the past 27 years, Dr. Huntoon has developed a specific treatment designed to get the body to recognize the toxic heavy metals and then sets the body on a course of excreting them from the system.
