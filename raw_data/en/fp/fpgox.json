In such a context, the spirit is strong and resilient, with the capacity to embrace and grow from pain and loss, which are natural conditions of human life. Integrative Psychiatry In modern-day culture, which is often deprived of the elements of a balanced life, emotional wellness may be harder to achieve. When physical injury, interpersonal loss or chronic illness enters one's life, nurturing the spirit becomes especially challenging. Sometimes, a sense of losing one's spirit occurs, which may manifest as anxiety, depression or difficulty taking care of oneself. The [UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Health](/clinics/osher-center-for-integrative-health) offers a number of services to enhance each person's capacity to promote his or her own emotional well-being, as well as their self-awareness, especially when confronted with inevitable stresses of life.
