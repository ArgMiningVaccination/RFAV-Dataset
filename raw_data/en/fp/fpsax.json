Do you want to improve your fertility using only natural remedies? Did you know that natural Ayurvedic Detox can help you improve your fertility thereby increasing our chance of conception? If yes, then detoxification and Ayurveda is the perfect solution for you. Using age-old traditional methods with a clean and healthy detox schedule, you can help boost your metabolism and also play a great role in improving your mental health! To detox, means to remove toxins from the body, in simple terminology. Well, it is not that simple. The toxins or the waste needs to be metabolized or neutralized with a proper scientific protocol mentioned in Ayurveda. Detoxification is a process that requires a great deal of care and precision and must be tailored to suit a specific body to ensure maximum benefits. A Detox is said to have several mental and physical benefits including improved metabolism, improved fertility, and also a happier mind. To understand the need for detoxification, it is essential to first understand the source of these toxins. In the present day scenario, it is safe to assume that we are surrounded by toxins from all directions, the air we breathe, the food we eat, the environment that we live in, the water that we drink everything is heavily loaded with dirt, chemicals, radiations, and toxins. Hap-hazardous lifestyle adds to the already existing poor conditions and we end up with a rather unhealthy lifestyle inviting diseases, metabolic disorders, [hormonal imbalances](https://www.fertilitydost.com/articles/article-details/seed-cycle--the-natural-way-to-improve-your-fertility), or autoimmune syndromes which slowly break down our body's natural system. A Detox allows us to rejuvenate and recuperate along with allowing us to focus on existing body conditions and work towards its improvement. Recent studies have also established an interesting link between the impact of a Detox on reproductive health showing favorable trends. For couples looking to undergo an IVF procedure or simply for those looking to prepare for pregnancy, a Detox can play an important role. When our digestive energies, known as Agni (fire), are robust, we create healthy tissues, eliminate waste products efficiently, and produce a subtle essence called Ojas. Ojas, which may be visualized as the innermost essence of our psycho-somatic wellbeing, is the basis for clarity of perception, physical strength, and immunity. On the other hand, if our Agni is weakened, digestion is incomplete and creates toxins that get stored in the body. This toxic residue is known as AMA and when AMA accumulates in the body, it blocks the flow of energy, information, and nourishment throughout the system. Ayurved considers this build-up of endotoxins the underlying cause of all disease. A common example of this is the accumulation of saturated fat and cholesterol that is beyond the body's capacity to metabolize. Over time, this leads to the blockage of the blood vessels and arteries and, ultimately, to heart attacks. By some means the accumulated cholesterol is metabolized or neutralized regularly out of the body, we won't ever suffer from arterial blockages with fatty deposits. This is known as detoxification. There are various ways this process of detoxification may be carried out in the body, according to the state and status of vitiation that has taken place. In Ayurved, or 'SHODHAN' etc could be prescribed by the physician after a thorough analysis of the patient. Of these procedures, SHODHAN form of treatment is the proper PANCHAKARMA treatment (5 purificatory procedures) advised in Ayurved which is prescribed only in very critical conditions, where management with other modalities fails or is beyond oral medication. These procedures usually require in-house admission and monitoring. The other modalities of detoxification are achieved through specific scientific dietary protocols, lifestyle regimen, exercise regimen, and appropriate science-based evidence-based medication. These do not require any in-house admission but there has to be proper follow-up by the patient for intended results. On the surface, this 'Ayurvedic Detox' may sound like any other cleanse popular these days like a liver cleanse or a kidney detox most of which are based on dietary regimens or the colon therapy but it is not. It is much deeper and multifaceted than the above. It aims to restore the imbalanced doshas viz. ( metabolize AMA(endotoxins) from the system, to improve the digestive strength (Agni) thereby normalizing the metabolism. Studies have shown that an Ayurvedic detox can have a tremendous impact on your reproductive health. Opting for a targeted detox for reproductive health can drastically help boost your metabolism system along with improving the functioning of your reproductive organs to help you conceive easier. A pre-pregnancy detox, if incorporated well can drastically help boost fertility and make conception easier. Studies also show that a Detox before pregnancy can significantly reduce the risk of diseases in the newborn. A detox combined with an organic lifestyle can help a great deal. A detox may also play a role in improving the sperm or [egg quality](https://www.fertilitydost.com/articles/) allowing you to experience higher rates of success while trying to conceive.
