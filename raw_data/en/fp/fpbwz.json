The main reason for the massive effect of COVID-19 on society is its unpredictable spread, which does not allow for proper planning or management of this disease. Antibiotics, antivirals, and other prescription drugs, necessary and used in therapy, obviously have side effects (minor or significant) on the affected person, there are still not clear enough studies to elucidate their combined effect in this specific treatment, and existing protocols are sometimes unclear and uncertain. In contrast, it has been found that nutraceuticals, supplements, and various herbs can be effective in reducing the chances of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms. However, not enough specific details are yet available, and precise scientific studies to validate the approved benefits of natural food additives, probiotics, herbs, and nutraceuticals will need to be standardized according to current regulations. These alternative treatments may not have a direct effect on the virus or reduce the risk of infection with it, but these products certainly stimulate the human immune system so that the body is better prepared to fight the disease. This paper aims at a specialized literary foray precisely in the field of these \"cures\" that can provide real revelations in the therapy of coronavirus infection", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-09-18", "cleaned_text": "in Reducing the Risk and Improving the Treatment of COVID-19 by It produces a severe acute respiratory disease that has spread dramatically throughout the world, and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [ [2](#B2-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The virus belongs to a large family named Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, that affects animals and mammals [ [3](#B3-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The highest numbers of cases were reported from the United States of America, India, Brazil, Russia, France, United Kingdom, Turkey, with many infected persons and deaths varying daily by continents, regions, and countries [ [4](#B4-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [5](#B5-biomedicines-09-01266)] affecting the nose, mouth, and eyes of an infected person. Common COVID-19 clinical signs include fever, exhaustion, dry cough, flu, dyspnea, headache, sore throat, etc., its essential manifestation of infection being pneumonia. The SARS-CoV-2 medical distal continuum can range from asymptomatic patients to critical pneumonia resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome sometimes contributing to multi-organ failure (MOF), and this infectious disease continues evolving and growing worldwide [ [6](#B6-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Some patients are characterized mainly by dyspnea and hypoxemia, which can gradually evolve into a moderate respiratory condition requiring oxygen treatment. [7](#B7-biomedicines-09-01266)]. COVID-19 has thus emerged as a flexible, multi-system, multi-organ disarray that causes pathogenic effects at the level of multiple organs via a fairly omnipresent target [ [8](#B8-biomedicines-09-01266)]. All age ranges are subject to the virus, and elderly patients with co-occurring diseases are more likely to experience a severe illness. Scientists have tried hard to produce an affordable and efficient vaccine with high therapeutic value, but few vaccines are already available to date; additionally, in seeing such a high rise in the daily cases of COVID-19, it would be necessary to implement precautions and hygienic measures to monitor and reduce human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before there is any successful intervention or consumption of dietary supplements along with herbal remedies which seem to be a very effective way to stop or at least to reduce this pandemic [ [9](#B9-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Most researchers' efforts are focused on recognizing and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 [ [10](#B10-biomedicines-09-01266)]. If this virus's characteristics and the mechanism of action of this virus causing the pandemic can be understood [ [11](#B11-biomedicines-09-01266)], evaluated, and established, an effective treatment protocol and specific logical therapy could be easily identified. [12](#B12-biomedicines-09-01266)] to delay a cytokine cascade and intercept the disease progression to a more serious form. [13](#B13-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [14](#B14-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Several vaccines and pharmaceuticals are already being administered for treating COVID-19 after being tested for their efficacy, protection, and dosage verification. However, the pandemic goes on, the 4th wave is increasing, and it seems that this pandemic will never end. [14](#B14-biomedicines-09-01266), [15](#B15-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Integration of any of these phytoconstituents (like vitamins) as a nutritional supplement) in the correct order may significantly boost the immune system, avoid the spread of the virus, prevent progress to the critical stage, and further inhibit the immune system hyperactivation providing prophylactic and therapeutic support against COVID-19 [ [16](#B16-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [17](#B17-biomedicines-09-01266)]. In this way, the food industry is attempting to manufacture substances that concentrate on bioactive substances found in food or in natural ingredients that are often regarded as nutraceuticals, which, besides their nutritional qualities, can provide results based on health benefits, in particular in the management of chronic diseases [ [18](#B18-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Compared to the standard drug treatments, these natural provenance therapeutics have minimal side effects, although no clinical trials or studies on the safety of non-pharmacological agents are available for the SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [19](#B19-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [20](#B20-biomedicines-09-01266)]. For this reason, we are trying to move towards these supplements and nutraceuticals that can eliminate the risk of infection by boosting the immune system and have no side effects. These are the best choices to fight against COVID-19 till any effective pharmaceuticals/drugs and vaccines can be manufactured and administered [ [21](#B21-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [22](#B22-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Though panic buying and shortages [ [23](#B23-biomedicines-09-01266)] followed, customers generally loaded up on vitamin C and other herbal items. As a result, researchers and the medical profession have increased their efforts to examine drug ingredients that could support the immune system, protect against the acute respiratory virus, and prevents the growth of SARS-CoV-2, the latest coronavirus that induces infection with COVID-19, resulting in many comprehensive studies highlighting the potential of natural compounds to treat SARS-CoV-2 [ [24](#B24-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [25](#B25-biomedicines-09-01266), [26](#B26-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Therefore, this current, timely analysis offers a thorough examination of the role of food and plant components and phytochemicals in early and fast-release experiments against the COVID-19 epidemic. [27](#B27-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Vitamin D supplementation is being considered by a rising number of scientific organizations for persons at high risk of COVID-19 [ [27](#B27-biomedicines-09-01266)]. We have also analyzed the extent to which vitamin D and other nutraceuticals and supplements offer a potential solution to the COVID-19 dilemma because research in these nutraceuticals and supplements is preliminary [ [27](#B27-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Herbal treatments are gaining popularity around the world as a way to treat several conditions. Before the discovery of antibiotics, herbal extracts were used to treat diseases, and purified natural products and herbal extracts now provide a rich pool of components for developing innovative antiviral medications [ [27](#B27-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [27](#B27-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [28](#B28-biomedicines-09-01266), [29](#B29-biomedicines-09-01266), [30](#B30-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Nutrients are essential for the benefits nutritional opportunities and modes of action of food additives and bioactive components confer against the SARS-CoV-2 virus [ [31](#B31-biomedicines-09-01266)]. These bioactive components can be found in fruits and vegetables and their consumption in the daily diet is strongly advised [ [32](#B32-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Vitamin C can also, in such circumstances, reduce inflammation of the lower airways and avoid respiratory infections [ [33](#B33-biomedicines-09-01266), [34](#B34-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 2. Methodology 3. Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 [37](#B37-biomedicines-09-01266), [38](#B38-biomedicines-09-01266)]. SARS-CoV-2 has notable, club-shaped spike-like projections on its surface, giving it the appearance of a solar corona. This novel coronavirus codes for four main structural proteins. Spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) are the proteins involved ( [Figure 2](#biomedicines-09-01266-f002)), and the capsid is a protein shell that contains nuclear capsid, or N-protein, which is attached to the virus's single positive strand RNA and allows it to hijack human cells and transform them into viral factories [ [38](#B38-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [39](#B39-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The M-protein is most abundant in the viral surface, and it is believed to be the central organizer for the coronavirus assembly. Coronavirus is a contagious one that may be transferred by inhalation or contact. The most significant cause of infection is virus droplets inhaled because of coughing and sneezing as a single sneeze can produce up to 10,000 droplets as well as contacting a contaminated surface which remains in the air in very tiny droplet form as shown in [Figure 2](#biomedicines-09-01266-f002). [39](#B39-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 4. Immune Response from Various Perspectives and Targeting SARS-CoV Viral Entry Mechanism [39](#B39-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Two very different SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are members of the genus that preceded the SARS-CoV-2. 229E and NL63, all from the family, and OC43 and HKU1 from the genus are the other forms of human coronavirus [ [40](#B40-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The RNA of this novel SARS-CoV-2 is 30 km long, the same duration as that of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses that created problems many years earlier [ [41](#B41-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [42](#B42-biomedicines-09-01266)]. According to another report, this virus shares a genome-sequence resemblance of about 45% to 90% with SARS-CoV, but only about 20% to 60% with MERS-CoV compared to a recognized bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV. This SARS-CoV-2 has shorter gene sequences. However, it has a more extended sequence than MERS-CoV [ [43](#B43-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [Figure 3](#biomedicines-09-01266-f003), the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV, binds to the human zinc peptidase ACE2, which is expressed on a variety of cells, including lung, heart, kidney, and intestinal cells, and thereby initiates viral entry into target cells [ [44](#B44-biomedicines-09-01266)]. S protein comprises two subunits, the N-terminal S1 subunit, and the C-terminal S2 subunit, which is attached to the viral membrane and necessary for spike trimerization and virus-host membrane fusion [ [45](#B45-biomedicines-09-01266)]. During viral assembly, the host enzyme furin cleaves the S protein between S1 and S2. The membrane-bound host protease TMPRSS2 is in charge of the proteolytic activation of the S2' site, which is required for conformational alterations and viral entry [ [46](#B46-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [Figure 2](#biomedicines-09-01266-f002)). SARS-CoV monoclonal human antibodies have been shown to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Some of them can also neutralize SARS-CoV-2 as one of the strategies. Several single-chain fragment variable-fragment crystallizable (scFv-Fc) antibodies effectively suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting spike protein binding to ACE2-expressing cells. The best IgG antibody might be a candidate for clinical development as passive immunotherapy for therapeutic and prophylactic purpose [ [47](#B47-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The targeting SARS-CoV viral entry mechanisms are shown in [Figure 3](#biomedicines-09-01266-f003). 5. Nutraceuticals or Supplements Targeting COVID-19 [48](#B48-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [48](#B48-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Several healthcare authorities have issued compassionate use approvals the onset of the 2019 COVID-19 disease outbreak of corona infectious disease [ [49](#B49-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Apart from remdesivir, which displayed promising effects and received urgent approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of COVID-19, no clear antimicrobial medication has yet been reported to be successful [ [50](#B50-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [51](#B51-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The resulting vital local vascular disorder, comprising micro-thrombosis and hemorrhage and culminating in pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy (PIC) [ [52](#B52-biomedicines-09-01266)] is adversely influenced by the severity of the intra-pulmonary infection. The reduced endothelial activity, which is an established subclinical phase of cardiovascular alteration, could also support the progression of a mortal form of this disease, resulting in increased coronary, cardiac, and renal abnormalities [ [53](#B53-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [54](#B54-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [55](#B55-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [56](#B56-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Vitamins C and E, carotenoids, Mn, Cu, and like flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignans, provide therapeutic or health advantages by working together to maintain an effective redox (oxidation-reduction) homeostasis [ [57](#B57-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Mainly, a polyphenol-rich diet is ideal for minimizing and avoiding cardiovascular disease. In addition, the shielding impact of polyphenols includes a reduction in oxidative stress or pressure arising from the inhibition of dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase or anti-platelet as defined by the decrease in platelet aggregation, the suppression of thrombin activity, and the existence of factor Ax [ [58](#B58-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [59](#B59-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [60](#B60-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Dietary supplements are products extracted from animals, plants may be synthesized by enzymes and are taken as pills, capsules, in powdered form and maybe in liquid form and also extracted from food sources or artificially produced to increase their quantity available for consumption [ [61](#B61-biomedicines-09-01266)]. They include one or more dietary elements such as vitamins, herbs, amino acids, enzymes, and minerals, etc. Out of all supplements, the most consumed multivitamin supplements are omega-3 or fish oil, vitamins C and D, and calcium [ [62](#B62-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [62](#B62-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [63](#B63-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 5.1. Vitamins 5.1.1. Vitamin C [22](#B22-biomedicines-09-01266)]. It has been reported that a high dose of vitamin C can destroy viruses because it has a virucidal impact that it can inactivate the multiplication of viruses in vitro, but this virucidal effect of vitamin C has not been confirmed in vivo [ [64](#B64-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The beneficial antiviral impact of this vitamin is demonstrated in many clinical studies [ [65](#B65-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Vitamin C supplements in humans improve the immune system, protect from reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reduce the risk, duration, and intensity of many infectious diseases [ [66](#B66-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Additionally, the deficiency of vitamin C is associated with pneumonia, as it confirmed in old research and studies. [66](#B66-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The latest findings ( [Table 1](#biomedicines-09-01266-t001)) indicate that vitamin C has an enormous impact on essential viral disease, lacking any particular treatment for COVID-19. In addition, vitamin C can increase tolerance to the coronavirus and, under specific circumstances, can influence the susceptibility to lower respiratory tract infections [ [66](#B66-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 5.1.2. Vitamin D [67](#B67-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Many experiments have shown that there are many biochemical pathways in which vitamin D can enhance the autoimmune response and reactions, regulate chronic inflammation, and reduce the danger to the human psyche of disease in a helpful manner [ [67](#B67-biomedicines-09-01266), [68](#B68-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Amon the many nutrients naturally present in food, the quantity of vitamin D available for intake is insufficient and for this reason, the food must be fortified, and orally taken supplements are often necessary to fulfill the body's vitamin D requirement [ [69](#B69-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [Table 1](#biomedicines-09-01266-t001)) [ [70](#B70-biomedicines-09-01266)]. In large-scale randomized studies, the presumption that vitamin D supplementation will reduce the likelihood of COVID-19 incidence, or the ratio of death should be evaluated or tested [ [71](#B71-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Currently, no details on dose, regular or tablet control methods (bolus), and security in the treatment of COVID-19 are available. However, scientists must focus on the detection and therapy of symptomless subjects or difficulties in victims afflicted by COVID-19 [ [72](#B72-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 5.2. Minerals\u2014Zinc [73](#B73-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Increased intracellular zinc concentrations efficiently impair replication in several RNA viruses [ [74](#B74-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Zinc has been shown to enhance cytotoxicity and induce apoptosis when used in vitro with a zinc ionophore (e.g., chloroquine). Chloroquine has also been shown to improve intracellular zinc uptake in vitro [ [75](#B75-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The relationship between zinc and COVID-19, including how zinc deficiency affects the severity of COVID-19 and whether zinc supplements can improve clinical outcomes, is currently under investigation [ [76](#B76-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Zinc levels are challenging to measure accurately, as zinc is distributed as a component of various proteins and nucleic acids [ [76](#B76-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Several clinical trials are currently investigating the use of zinc supplementation alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine to prevent and treat COVID-19. The recommended dietary allowance for elemental zinc is 11 mg daily for men and 8 mg for nonpregnant women ( [Table 1](#biomedicines-09-01266-t001)). The doses used in registered clinical trials for patients with COVID-19 vary between studies, with a maximum dose of zinc sulfate 220 mg (50 mg of elemental zinc) twice daily [ [77](#B77-biomedicines-09-01266)]. However, there are currently insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of zinc to treat COVID-19. 5.3. Probiotics [78](#B78-biomedicines-09-01266)]. These include the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera of bacteria, typically present in fermented food. Traditionally prepared cuisine often includes such fermented foods since these bacteria restore the balance of microbes in the gut [ [75](#B75-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Over the last two decades, many studies and clinical trials have suggested that probiotics may help modulate the immune response and treat various diseases, especially viral infections [ [79](#B79-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Many findings indicate that such probiotics maintain a healthy host immune system that helps the body rebound after a respiratory viral infection in animal models; not only did these interventions enhance the health of the animals, but they lowered the viral load in their lungs and boosted survival rates [ [80](#B80-biomedicines-09-01266)]. These arrived at a rough list of probiotic strains that may help prevent infection and enhance immune function to reduce the impact of viral infections, especially COVID-19 [ [81](#B81-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may be transmitted even in asymptomatic individuals or during the pre-symptomatic phases of the disease. The latter may last for up to 2 weeks, exposing others to heavy viral loads and a high risk of infection [ [81](#B81-biomedicines-09-01266)] as demonstrated further in [Table 1](#biomedicines-09-01266-t001). Probiotics may trap the virus in respiratory diseases and inhibit the binding of the virus to the host cell receptors [ [9](#B9-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 5.4. Natural Polyphenols 5.4.1. Resveratrol [82](#B82-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Several studies have shown that it has antitumor activity, antioxidant activity and potent antiviral effects, anti-ageing properties, and cardioprotective effects in-vivo and in-vitro [ [83](#B83-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The therapeutical efficacy of polyphenols has been carefully vetted in the control and diagnosis of retroviruses and, in particular, in respiratory problem-causing microbes [ [84](#B84-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Wahedi et al. [ [85](#B85-biomedicines-09-01266)] have shown polyphenols to form an extremely reliable compound with the human ACE-2 transmitter using MD simulation stimulus, which COVID-19 needs to reach target cells using S-protein. Various reports also show an improved intake of supplementary RSV, related to higher plasma level, when eaten with food, whereas others document a slower but not radically changed cumulative absorption. [86](#B86-biomedicines-09-01266), [87](#B87-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [84](#B84-biomedicines-09-01266)]. It also blocked MERS-CoV replication in vitro by inhibiting RNA synthesis and had other pleiotropic consequences, and it inhibited viral replication and reduced the death risk in piglets infected with the duck enteritis virus [ [84](#B84-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Although RSV has a low bioavailability, nanoparticle formulations can improve its stability and absorption [ [88](#B88-biomedicines-09-01266), [89](#B89-biomedicines-09-01266)]. There is currently no evidence that RSV has been used to treat SARS-CoV-2; nevertheless, available research suggests that it may be a beneficial adjunctive antiviral agent to consider. 5.4.2. Quercetin [90](#B90-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties. Quercetin's antioxidant potential and free radical scavenging ability are primarily responsible for its neuroprotective impact [ [91](#B91-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Supplementing with quercetin has been shown to improve mitochondrial biogenesis, energy output, and electron transport chain performance and modify ROS production and mitochondrial defects. It can cross the blood-brain barrier [ [92](#B92-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [93](#B93-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Quercetin may thus be a novel therapeutic agent for COVID-19-induced AKI. Inhibition of inflammatory, cell apoptosis-related signaling pathways may be the critical mechanism by which quercetin protects the kidney from SARS-CoV-2 injury [ [94](#B94-biomedicines-09-01266), [95](#B95-biomedicines-09-01266)] and is mentioned in [Table 1](#biomedicines-09-01266-t001). 6. Herbs Considered Usable for the Treatment of COVID-19 6.1. Curcuma longa [96](#B96-biomedicines-09-01266)]. In Asian countries, C. longa has long been used as a prescription medicine or supplement to treat diabetes, coronary disease, obesity, neurodegenerative disease, inflammatory bowel disease, allergy or asthma, and psoriasis [ [97](#B97-biomedicines-09-01266)]. It also serves as an C. longa %), minerals (3.5%), and are used as medicines and supplements, being also an effective therapy for hypertension as demonstrated in several trials [ [21](#B21-biomedicines-09-01266), [98](#B98-biomedicines-09-01266)]. On the other hand, a comprehensive study found that using curcumin as more of an antihypertensive requires a longer time to impact blood pressure reduction, about 12 weeks [ [99](#B99-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [100](#B100-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Based on these findings, it's possible that using curcumin to avoid COVID-19 infection might result in a highly susceptible person being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and worsening their condition. Since the novel virus has a distinct receptor, ACE2, which is also active in the hypertension pathway, this phase happens. Curcumin, as a RAAS inhibitor, has been shown to improve the expression and synthesis of ACE2. As a result, using curcumin to prevent infection can trigger susceptible people to contract COVID-19. Curcumin as a COVID-19 therapy may be reconsidered since it induces a rise in ACE2, accelerating the disease's development [ [101](#B101-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [102](#B102-biomedicines-09-01266)]. It may raise or decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines. CRS, or cytokine storm, is a hyperinflammatory and hypercytokinaemia seen in some COVID-19 patients [ [103](#B103-biomedicines-09-01266)], but curcumin can also increase the development of pro-inflammatory cytokines, worsening the status of COVID-19 patients who are experiencing a cytokine storm. Further research is needed to understand further the function of curcumin in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. 6.2. Cinchona officinalis [104](#B104-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Quinine is a plant-derived medicine currently under investigation for COVID-19 treatment that was discovered as the principal bioactive compound in Cinchona officinalis, a south American antimalarial medicinal plant [ [105](#B105-biomedicines-09-01266)]. A preliminary clinical study in France recently showed promising activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in COVID-19 patients. Interestingly chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are synthetic analogues of quinine and have been approved for treating malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis [ [106](#B106-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [107](#B107-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The second example is the lung cleansing and detoxifying decoction (LCDD), widely used in treating COVID-19 patients in China that was developed based on four formulae described in the classic text Treatise on Cold Pathogenic and Miscellaneous Diseases by Zhang Zhongjing [ [108](#B108-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 6.3. Allium sativum [109](#B109-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Recent studies have studied its potential active compound allicin as a possible candidate for strengthening the immune system, and the immune regulatory roles of garlic extracts and extracted compounds were thoroughly investigated [ [110](#B110-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Immune dysfunction is well-known to play a role in the development and progression of various diseases, and this functional diet additive can help prevent and treat diseases including obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disorders, gastric ulcers, and even cancer in treating cancers affected by compounds like aflatoxin B1. Aged garlic extract (AGE) may be used as an herbal remedy with fewer side effects than chemotherapy [ [111](#B111-biomedicines-09-01266)]. It also seems to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 infection, and this functional food, when used as part of a preventive strategy can strengthen immune system components in the battle against this pathogen [ [112](#B112-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Pre-existing cancer and/or hypertension are considered two of the main factors leading to increasing morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 infection; garlic is considered as having essential role in these conditions as well [ [108](#B108-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 6.4. Sambucus nigra [113](#B113-biomedicines-09-01266)]. In herbal formulations, both the rose and fruit of mature trees have traditionally been used to treat influenza [ [114](#B114-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The bioactive compounds found in elderberry are primarily polyphenols and anthocyanins. The primary polyphenols in plant is rutin, while the other flavanols, like iso-quercitrin and astragalin, occur in elderberries in smaller amounts [ [115](#B115-biomedicines-09-01266), [116](#B116-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Its extracts were used in the early stages of the epidemic, although its supplements have not been tested for coronavirus treatment, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown that they effectively treat colds and influenza [ [117](#B117-biomedicines-09-01266)]. There have been extensive reports on the beneficial effects of elderberry products on various viral infections. Few theories have been established on the potential immunological mechanisms for elderberry supplements beneficial effects as they may help reduce upper respiratory symptoms caused by viral infections and help alleviate flu symptoms [ [118](#B118-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 6.5. Piper nigrum L. [119](#B119-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Apart from that, this plant produces over 600 different bioactive compounds, including lignans, terpenes, and neolignanes, all of which encompass different bioactive compounds and therapeutic applications. The anti-parasitic biological function of black pepper was studied in depth [ [120](#B120-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The main alkaloid constituents, piperine and piperamides, are phytochemicals that can aid in the battle against COVID-19, where it appears to reduce respiratory system infection and have antiviral and antibacterial properties [ [121](#B121-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 6.6. Withania somnifera [122](#B122-biomedicines-09-01266)]. For millennia, Ashwagandha has become one of the most widely used Rasayana herbs in the ayurvedic tradition. WS has regenerative, anticoagulant properties [ [123](#B123-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [124](#B124-biomedicines-09-01266)]. When developing diagnosis and clinical goals, it is critical to understand the causes of COVID-19 and its common lung affliction before the internal organ collapse and neurological abnormalities that often precede death occur [ [125](#B125-biomedicines-09-01266)]. WS has been shown to have several beneficial pulmonary consequences, including lowering pulmonary hypertension through decreasing inflammation, oxidative stress, epithelial dysfunction, respiratory cell apoptosis, and pulmonary respiratory system tolerance [ [126](#B126-biomedicines-09-01266)]. WS has been shown to trigger the innate immune system and selectively regulate the immune response of Th1 cells. The antiviral properties of the phytoconstituents of WS have previously been demonstrated in experiments. The transforming enzyme of angiotensin has also been shown to be suppressed by an aqueous WS extract, which is now being seen as a potential therapeutic target for COVID 19 therapy [ [127](#B127-biomedicines-09-01266), [128](#B128-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 6.7. Ocimum sanctum [87](#B87-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Several in-vitro and in-vivo experiments on humans and other species have shown their therapeutic properties as antibacterial, antidiabetic, anti-carcinogenic, antiviral, bashing, cardio-protective, immune system enhancer, and so on [ [87](#B87-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Tulsi is recognized in Ayurveda as the 'Elixir of Life' because of its powerful curative properties and ability to cure various ailments, including lung disease, vertigo, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, skin infections, urinary and infectious diseases, gastrointestinal and pulmonary diseases, and more [ [129](#B129-biomedicines-09-01266)]. In terms of Ocimum sanctum function in COVID-19 management, Tulsi is often used to relieve pain, diarrhea, coughing, and congestion, all of which are common COVID-19 symptoms [ [41](#B41-biomedicines-09-01266), [130](#B130-biomedicines-09-01266), [131](#B131-biomedicines-09-01266)]. [129](#B129-biomedicines-09-01266)]. The lead molecules are chlorogenic acid and luteolin-7-O-glucuronide. Coffee beans have the highest concentration of chlorogenic acid. SARA CoV 3CL (homologous to Mpro SARS membranaceus [132](#B132-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Astragalus polysaccharides as one of the main components of AM has been proven to be an immunomodulator and prevent viral infection in chickens infected with the H9N2 avian influenza virus in an in-vitro/in-vivo analysis published in 2013 [ [129](#B129-biomedicines-09-01266)]. IL-12, IL-4, and antibody titers to H9N2 AIV were shown to be higher in the first week after therapy during in-vivo lymphocyte and in-vivo [133](#B133-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Thymoquinone, the most powerful phytochemical in black cumin, is responsible for the bulk of the spice's therapeutic properties [ [134](#B134-biomedicines-09-01266)]. NS oil and seeds have been shown to be virucidal against a number of lethal viruses, including HCV and HIV [ [135](#B135-biomedicines-09-01266)]. NS seed oil suppressed the viral burden to undetectable levels within ten days of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of black seed oil in tonic, blood purifier properties that help to improve digestion and boost the immune system, as well as broad-spectrum antimicrobial effectiveness against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, that guard against aflatoxin-induced nephrotoxicity [ [141](#B141-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Only one compound, namely tinocordiside (CID_177384) showed a high binding affinity as compared to built-in ligand N3 for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as per YASARA scoring. Tinocordiside had a binding energy of 8.10 kcal/mol and was found to be a new rearranged cadinane sesquiterpene glycoside [ [142](#B142-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 6.11. Glycyrrhiza glabra [143](#B143-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Among the compounds tested, glycyrrhizin was perhaps the most effective at inhibiting FFM-1 and FFM-2 virus replication [ [144](#B144-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Glycyrrhizin not only stopped FFM-1 and FFM-2 viruses from replicating but also disrupted their biosorption and osmotic replication cycles [ [145](#B145-biomedicines-09-01266)]. Moreover, the crude extract has anti-herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) action, which may be due to its good anti-adhesion properties, which specifically inhibited HSV-1 virus attachment [ [143](#B143-biomedicines-09-01266)]. 6.12. Zingiber officinalis [146](#B146-biomedicines-09-01266)]. These chemicals have antimicrobial activities against various bacteria, viruses, and fungus. Especially the presence of one of the antioxidant compounds in the ginger root has potential anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting characteristics, which helps enhance the normal metabolic activities in the human body, fight against infections and toxins to shield against harmful effects of bacteria, viruses, and any other diseases. Thus, ginger has proved to be a powerful immune booster plant with particular antiviral properties [ [130](#B130-biomedicines-09-01266)]. In comparison to dried ginger, the fresh one is reported to inhibit human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV)-induced plaque formation when taken in proper doses in both the adenocarcinomic human alveolar cancer cell line A549 and human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2) cell lines. Also, 300 \u00b5g/mL of fresh ginger is found to reduce the plaque counts to 19.7% (A549) and 27.0% HEp-2 compared to the control group, respectively [ [130](#B130-biomedicines-09-01266)]. It shows more promising results when given before viral inoculation [ [130](#B130-biomedicines-09-01266)].
