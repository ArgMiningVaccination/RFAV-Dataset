Many people familiar with her work consider her to be the founder of alternative medicine. In Germany, [Hildegard of Bingen Medicine](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/hildegard-of-bingen-medicine/) has been an essential aspect of the popular rebirth of [traditional German medicine](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/traditional-german-herbal-medicine/), where ancient natural remedies have come to life (again). Hildegard's contribution to [monastic medicine](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/monastic-medicine/), which in German is known as [klosterheilkunde](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/klosterheilkunde/), has even been recognized by modern science. Birth of Traditional German Medicine Historical records indicate that in western Europe, over 1,500 years ago, monks and nuns had been testing the effects that elements found in nature like flower blossoms, plant leaves and roots had on the human body. These altruistic researchers discovered and advanced numerous effective naturopathic remedies to address the maladies of daily living, such as coughs, rashes, and stomach problems. Throughout the years these scholars maintained extensive records of their findings. The most famous living works of [monastic medicine](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/monastic-medicine/) date back to the 12th century, namely the work of Hildegard of Bingen (1098 - 1179) as she collected naturopathic remedies, tested them for their efficacy, and documented her findings. The Benedictine Way The Order of Saint Benedict took a holistic view of people. Their basic credo resonates with [Hildegard's views on balance](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/bodily-humors-and-balance/); that those who are in [harmony with the world and themselves live healthily](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/healing-harmony/). Diseases would arise if the harmony was disturbed. Hildegard, therefore, recommended a balanced relationship between sleep and activity, and recommended a diet of whole fruits and vegetables, with a particular affinity for spelt, as a basis for stable health. The healing recipes, with ingredients plucked from the monastery garden, ensured that the balance of body and fitness was maintained. "}
