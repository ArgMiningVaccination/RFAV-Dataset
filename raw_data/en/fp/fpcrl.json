In1969, the focus switched to the less ambitious goal ofcontrol through treatment. At the time, the treatment ofchoice was chloroquine, dispensed in a three-day course.An effective treatment campaign led to falling death ratesthrough to the early 1980s. However, since the early eighties, the situation has stopped improving, and has in fact been gettingdramatically worse. Average annual cases were four timeshigher between 1982 and 1997 compared to the period1962-1981. Death rates have also jumped: hospital studiesin various African countries have documented a two- tothree-fold increase in malaria deaths. The continuing useof ineffective drugs despite spectacular levels of resistanceis leading to increased treatment failure. While African countries are heeding the advice of world experts to switch from old failing single-drug treatmentsto combination treatments, they are being forced to switchto stop-gap, less expensive combinations because of a lackof resources.AACT Now. This is an urgent call to international donors to join African countries in implementing World HealthOrganisation (WHO) treatment guidelines for malaria. Onthe advice of international experts, WHO recommendsAfrican countries facing resistance to classical antimalarialsto introduce drug combinations containing artemisinincompounds - artemisinin-based combination therapy, orACT for short. Artemisinin derivatives have attributes that make them especially effective: they are highly potent, fast-acting(parasite clearance is fast and people recover quickly), verywell tolerated and complementary to other classes oftreatment. Implementation of new malaria recommendations is a matter of life and death in Africa, where malaria kills between1 and 2 million people each year. Sickness and death frommalaria account for 30-50% of hospital admissions and ayearly loss of US$12 billion on the African continent. The WHO-led global malaria eradication programme launched in the 1950s sought to eliminate the disease viavector control and effective treatment. The eradication\u00a9 carloline livio/msfACT NOW - MSF 2003 5Summary <<< Why is MSF so focused on treatment? Effective malaria control requires strong political will from endemic country governments that translates intoimplementation of comprehensive prevention andtreatment programmes. But while the internationalcommunity has been willing to do everything possible toaugment prevention, there has so far been no concerteddrive to support improved treatment. In the MSF projects that include malaria components we fully support prevention as an integral part of effectivemalaria control. There is no controversy there. The debatethat we think needs to be stimulated is on treatment. It was only after extensively documenting resistance to current treatments in MSF projects and carefullyconsidering data gathered by ministries of health inendemic countries that MSF decided to switch to ACT in allof its programmes. The decision was articulated in anOctober 2002 internal MSF malaria policy paper: To ensure \"good patient care now and in the future, and to prevent the further spread of the disease in intensityand into new populations, MSF believes it is essential touse artemisinin-containing combination therapy (ACT) inall our programmes where there are patients withfalciparum malaria, and to explore all avenues open toMSF to assist governments to do the same in affectedcountries. Since October 2002, implementation of this policy has focused simultaneously on switching to ACT in all MSFprojects, and on advocating for and giving technicalsupport towards increasing the availability of quality ACTdrugs. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) is seeking to change the current dynamic in which some international donorcountries, such as the US and UK, are supporting a \"leaveit alone\" approach while other countries have no publiclyarticulated policy. This report debunks detractors'arguments by demonstrating that ACT is safe and effective. The lack of political and financial support on the part of donors means that endemic countries are often encouragedto \"leave alone\" failing malaria treatment and are not givenfinancial and technical help to implement more effectivestrategies. Without successful implementation of ACT therapies in the next 10-15 years, significant progress in controllingmalaria will be impossible. This is because there are nomiracle non-ACT combinations waiting in the wings, and because malaria control using prevention without effectivetreatment is doomed to failure. How can we \"leave alone\" malaria treatment when one African child dies of malaria every thirty seconds? This report defines The Malaria Problem , looks at What Works in malaria treatment and outlines what needs to be done to Make ACT a Reality . Our recommendations convey what MSF thinks needs to be done to stem the tide of unnecessary malaria deaths in Africa. The idea is a simple one. Restock Africa with a malaria medicine that works: The World Health Organization must push for implementation of its own recommendation to switch to ACT Donors must stop wasting their money funding drugs that don't work and help fund efforts of endemiccountries to make the switch to ACT Endemic countries need to back up their will to improve malaria control with increased budget allocations ACT must be provided to individuals free of charge, or at an affordable price International agencies and donors must provide technical support to facilitate both treatment implementation andupgrading international and domestic drug suppliers (with technology transfer and technical assistance to enhance production standards) UNICEF, WHO procurement and the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria must pool needs and makelarge orders to prime the drug production pump andbring down prices International and/or regional pre-qualification needs to be augmented to assist countries in identifying qualitydrug sources Concerned parties must undertake operational research to improve use of current tools Research & development for new drugs, new formulations and improved diagnostic tools must beplaced high on the agenda and implemented throughgovernment supported research and not-for-profitinitiatives such as the Medicines for Malaria Venture. We need to implement ACT today. We need to act now. \"Malaria is like the common cold, except that it's a killer\" Nitya, MSF doctor, Kajo chloroquineSP: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamineMalaria prevalence in AfricaMalaria prevalence and the burden of resistance Using 14 or 28-day follow-up, MSF has documented resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in its medical aid projects throughout sub-Saharan Africa>>>the malaria problem>>> >>> Why Africa can't wait any longer for treatment that works 6 ACT NOW - MSF 2003M ACT NOW - MSF 2003 7Malaria is the \"hidden\" global scourge. And Africa is at its epicenter. Where malaria thrives, people suffer and economies are drained. Malaria, a parasitic disease (see box page 8),thwarts children's cognitive development and education,and adults' ability to make a living and care fortheir families. 1At a country level, it impacts on trade, tourism and foreign direct investment. There is aremarkable correlation between malaria and poverty:average GDP in malarious countries is five times lower thanin non-malarious countries. 2Malaria keeps poor people poor. Malaria statistics read like a road map to a place where no one wants to go: 300-500 million cases a year, 90% ofthem in 1-2 million deaths a year,mostly in Africa; US$12 billion lost every year in Africa 3; 30-50% of all African hospital admissions4; and the litany goes on. Malaria is the leading killer of Africa's children. Malaria is not an incurable disease, and treatment need not last a lifetime. It is curable in no more than three days.Treatment that works does exist. Why, then, are so manypeople in Africa dying of malaria? Because Africans withmalaria are not benefiting from proven preventionstrategies and treatment that works. Affordable, efficaciousdrugs are not available to them, so people continue to useolder medicines that health experts know are no longerworking. No secret There is no secret about the best treatment for malaria today. Combination therapy using artemisinin derivativesis so effective that it is bringing about a revolution in thetreatment of the disease, particularly in Asia, where its useis widespread. It is time to bring artemisinin-containingcombination therapy, or ACT, to Africa. The World HealthOrganization (WHO), international donors and Africangovernments cannot afford to let this treatment bypass thecontinent where malaria is taking its greatest toll. Already bypassed once Malaria eradication was identified as a priority in the mid-twentieth century, with the discovery in 1942 of theinsecticidal properties of DDT and the establishment of theWorld Health Organization in 1948. The WHO-led GlobalEradication of Malaria program, launched in the 1950s,sought to eliminate the disease via vector control with DDTand through treatment with chloroquine. Yet the campaign bypassed sub-Saharan Africa, where eradication was considered impractical because of the highlevel of transmission and the lack of infrastructure. 5Malaria was, however, effectively eradicated in zones whereinfection was lower (areas of southern Europe, NorthAmerica, Mauritius and Singapore, Hong Kong, parts ofsevere malaria epidemic in Burundi caused around 3 million cases among a population of 6.5 million people. 11The epidemic caused 13,000 deaths in only three provinces. Human migration, often as a result of war or conflict, has played a role in this resurgence. People who haven'tdeveloped natural resistance to malaria increasinglymigrate to regions where the disease is rife. At the sametime, poverty, war and political instability have weakenedIn the 1950s, malaria eradication in Africa was considered impracticalToday in many African countries, chloroquine and SP are virtually useless > > 050100150 1900 1930 1950 1970 1990 1997250 200per 100 000 population Malaria mortality annual rates since 1900 World not including sub-Saharan Africa Worldwide sub-Saharan Africa192 194 223 172 174 216 39 48 184 7 2 117 18 16516 107 148Malaysia, and elsewhere). Eventually the malaria parasite developed resistance to DDT; at the same time, concernsabout the pesticide's safety emerged, and the eradicationstrategy was dropped. By 1969, WHO accepted the necessityof control programs in areas where the disease was noteradicated; the focus turned to control through chloroquinetreatment. For a time, this seemed to keep the disease incheck, and certainly mortality in Africa due to malariadeclined through the early 1980s (see figure 2), due in largepart to the availability of cheap and effective drugs. 6 Malaria is roaring back Now, however, malaria has roared back in Africa, spreading throughout almost all of sub-Saharan Africa. Theaverage annual number of reported malaria cases in theperiod 1982-1997 is four times that reported in the period1962-1981. 7Deaths have also increased. After a steady decline from the early 1900s to the early 1980s, the annualmalaria mortality rate in Africa has jumped dramaticallyover the last two decades, even as that of the rest of theworld has declined. 8And, since 1990, even as all-cause mortality for children has dropped in Africa, malaria-specificmortality has been on the rise. 9 There has also been a recent, striking increase in the number of severe malaria epidemics on the continent, withepidemics in 35 areas between 1997-2002. 10To give just one example: between October 2000 and March 2001, a Figure 2Source: World Health Organisation, World Health Report 1999WWhhaatt iiss mmaallaarriiaa?? Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by four species of Plasmodium protozoa Of the four species, Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the most deaths. The parasite transmission by Anophelese mosquitoes, the vector,is affected by climate and geography, and is often highest during the rainy season. When a malaria-infected Anopheles mosquito bites a human, the parasite passes into the person's bloodstream, where it multiplies and can cause illness or even death.When this person is bitten by another mosquito, the parasite travels from human backto insect and the cycle continues. Symptoms of malaria include fever, shivering, pain in the joints, headaches, repeated vomiting, convulsions and coma. If left untreated, the disease - particularly that causedby P. falciparum - may progress to severe malaria and sometimes death. In areas where the disease is endemic, repeated bouts with the disease are common. African children can get malaria many times each year. Such repeated exposure canhave grave health consequences: chronic anaemia, malnutrition, retarded physical andcognitive development, and potential increases in vulnerability to other diseases. 8 ACT NOW - MSF 2003public health systems in many developing countries.Changing demographics and land use have also played apart. And most experts agree that the resurgence of thedisease is due in large part to that fact that malariaparasites and its vector are increasingly developingresistance to the drugs and insecticides used to controlthem. The drugs are failing In the 1950s, the drug chloroquine was first introduced to treat malaria. Fast, effective and cheap, it seemed amiracle drug, and a potent ally in the fight to eradicate thedisease. But uncontrolled and widespread use contributedto the rapid emergence and spread of resistance (see boxpage 9) beginning in the mid-1960s, radiating out fromSoutheast Asia, and hitting Africa by the late 1970s. In response, another drug, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP, also known as Fansidar\u00ae) was widely introduced, inthe 1970s in Southeast Asia (starting in 1973 in Thailand)and in Africa in the early 1990s (starting in 1993 in Malawi).Initially, it was extremely useful: it is taken as a single dose,and side-effects are very uncommon. But optimism wasshort-lived: within five years, resistance to this drug hadalready developed in much of Southeast Asia, and is nowspreading rapidly through Africa.Today, in many African countries, resistance to chloroquine and SP is so high that both drugs are virtually useless. Togive only a few examples: 1999 figures show 50-90%resistance to chloroquine in Burundi, 66-87% resistance inKenya. 12According to EANMAT (East African Network for Monitoring Antimalarial Treatment), SP resistance reached27% in Bondo and 42% in Kisumu in Kenya in 2000 and 17%in Kyela and 34% in Mkuzi in Tanzania in 1999. 13It is important to note that these data represent treatment failuredetected on day seven after start of treatment. Such a shortfollow-up underestimates resistance compared to a longerfollow-up (eg, 14 or 28 days). 14Using 14 or 28-day follow-up, MSF has documented resistance to chloroquine and SP in itsmedical aid projects throughout sub-Saharan Africa (see mappage opposite), a growing drug resistance also recognizedby the World Health Organization. 15 Treatment failure = more deaths Ineffective drugs continue to be used despite the spectacular levels of resistance, leading to increasedtreatment failure. Treatment failure leads to rising rates ofmortality, particularly among children: hospital studies invarious African countries have documented a two- to three-fold increase in malaria deaths and hospital admissions forsevere malaria, corresponding to the rise in chloroquineMalaria is curable, but so ma because they are >HHooww ddooeess aa ppaarraassiittee ddeevveelloopp rreessiissttaannccee ttoo ddrruuggss?? Drug resistance occurs through spontaneous genetic mutations in the parasite. When a patient is treated with a drug (eg, chloroquine), the parasites that are still sensitive to thisdrug are killed - but other parasites have \"mutated\" genes which means that they survive.The mutated parasites survive to reproduce and infect other mosquitoes and, in turn, anotherperson. The parasites with the resistant mutation are thus favoured to survive and reproduce.Several mutations occurring in the same parasite are required to make a parasite resistant tochloroquine, while a relatively small number of mutations are required to make the parasiteresistant to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP, also known as Fansidar\u00ae), which is whyresistance to SP seems to develop much more quickly than resistance to chloroquine. Among the factors that increase the likelihood of the survival and transmission of the resistant mutant are failure to complete a course of treatment, poor quality drugs that do nothave adequate active ingredient, and clinical diagnosis. The typical malarial symptoms, suchas fever, headache and chills, are non-specific to malaria. Basing diagnosis on clinicalsymptoms without using laboratory tests to confirm the presence of malaria parasitestherefore means that many people who do not actually have malaria may end up beingtreated with antimalarial drugs. The use of two drugs together, with different mechanisms of action , significantly decreases the likelihood of any one parasite having the mutations required to resist both drugs.resistance.16In Senegal, the emergence of chloroquine resistance has been directly linked to a dramatic increase inmalaria mortality between 1984 and 1995 in Sahel, savannahand forest areas. This suggests that the spread of chloroquineresistance has had \"a dramatic impact on the level of malariamortality in most epidemiological contexts in tropical Africa.\" 17 International guidelines to instruct countries in choosing appropriate malaria treatment were established in April 2001.The World Health Organization recommends that treatmentfailure rates should be less than 5%. Failure rates between5 and 15% represent a warning period. Once treatment failurerises to between 16 and 24%, activities to initiate change oftreatment protocol should start. And when treatment failureexceeds 25%, change is required. 18 Chloroquine-resistant parasites had already been identified in all countries of tropical Africa by 1988.19A majority of affected African countries have now reached the 25% failurerate for chloroquine and, in many places, the SP failure rateis also worsening. International and African leaders acknowledge the crisis This is not all happening in a vacuum, completely unnoticed. In the late 1990s, there was recognition thatsomething had to be done to address malaria's expandingthreat. Roll Back Malaria, a global partnership, was foundedin 1998 by the United Nations. Roll Back Malaria in turnconvened the first-ever summit on malaria in Abuja, Nigeria,in April 2000. Senior officials from 44 affected African countries, including 19 heads of state, expressed their resolveto meet three main targets by 2005: ensure that 60% of thosesuffering from malaria have prompt access to correct,affordable and appropriate treatment; ensure that at least60% of those affected by malaria benefit from suitableprotective measures, such as insecticide-treated nets; andensure that at least 60% of all pregnant at risk formalaria receive chemoprophylaxis or presumptive intermittenttreatment. 20They reiterated their commitment to the Roll Back Malaria goal of cutting African malaria deaths in half by2010, a commitment that was echoed by the world leadersat the 2000 G8 summit in Okinawa. In recent years, as a result of these laudable initiatives, there has been much fanfare over attempts to implementpreventive measures such as provision of insecticide treatedbednets or insecticide spraying. Malaria has also beenheadlined for funding from the Global Fund for AIDS,Tuberculosis and Malaria. Yet so far, much of the rhetoric hasnot been followed up with concrete action. And, according toan external evaluation of the Roll Back Malaria partnership,in the last several years not only has there not been areduction in malaria - there may even have been an increase. 21 Prevention efforts must be strengthened and commitments reinforced. And halving malaria mortality by 2010 will requirethat millions of people who do contract the disease each yearreceive treatment that works. ny people in Africa are dying ting treatment that works > ACT NOW - MSF 2003 9>>>what works>>> >>> Artemisinin-containing combination therapy - the prescription for Africa 10 ACT NOW - MSF 2003\u00a9 remco bohleDDespite spreading resistance and rising mortality rates (see Part 1), the malaria treatment scenario is not without hope.Effective treatments do exist. Experts agree that the bestcurrent treatment is a combination of drugs that includesartemisinin derivatives, made from a Chinese plant (see boxpage 12). 1In widespread use to treat malaria for much of the past decade, artemisinin derivatives relieve clinical symptomsand decrease parasite load faster than any other antimalarial.This has been shown in studies in China, Vietnam andThailand, 2and in a meta-analysis undertaken by the World Health Organization's/Special Program for Research andTraining in Tropical Diseases (TDR) of artemisin-basedcombinations vs. standard drugs in monotherapy, coveringtrials in Senegal, The Gambia, and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (in addition to several non-African countries. 3 In addition, an evaluation including clinical data from province-wide use in KwaZulu Natal in SouthAfrica, 4reinforce these positive results. Artemisinin has several characteristics that make it an excellent malaria medicine:1. It brings down the parasitaemia (the number of parasites in the blood) faster than any other antimalarial drug -ten times faster than the previous best, quinine. 2. It has few side-effects.3.

WHO recommends in particular, the use of drug combinations containingartemisinin compounds \u2014 artemisinin-based combination therapy \u2014 ACT for short. Artemisinin-based combinations have several distinct advantages in that they produce rapid clinical and parasitological cure, there is as yet no documented parasiteresistance, they reduce gametocyte carriage rate, and are generally well tolerated. Based on available safety and efficacy data, the following therapeutic options are now available: 1. artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem) 2. artesunate plus amodiaquine3. artesunate plus SP in areas where SP efficacy remains high\" World Health Organization, Statement, February 2002 and \"Antimalarial drug combination therapy: Report of a WHO Technical Consultation,\" 4-5April 2002, Genevano reports of severe toxicity, suggesting that immediate and severe complications associated with this group ofdrugs are rare. 5 4. Artemisinin is well absorbed by mouth and is not unpleasant to take. 5. It can also be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection, in a once-daily administration. 6. Its use is shown to markedly reduce the carriage of gametocytes, the infective form of the parasite in humanblood. 7. No resistance to artemisinins has been reported, despite centuries of use in China. Artemisinin-containing combination therapy \u2014 ACT Artemisinin derivatives should never be used alone, but always with a companion drug. There is now substantialevidence that using a combination of drugs withindependent modes of action and different biochemicaltargets is not only more effective, but also successful inpreventing or slowing the development of resistance,because the probability of parasites being simultaneouslyresistant to two drugs is greatly reduced. This thinking hasbeen applied for some time to the treatment oftuberculosis and leprosy and, more recently, to HIV/AIDS. 6 In malaria treatment, using the combination drug approachwith artemisinins means using artemisinin-containingcombination therapy, or ACT. ACT NOW - MSF 2003 11RReeddiissccoovveerreedd ccuurree Although artemisinin is being acclaimed the most important new malaria drug by top international health authorities, artemisinin and its derivatives have been around forquite a long time. Artemisinin and artemisinin derivatives are extracts from a plant, Artemisia annua. The Artemisia plant is usually more known by its common names of sweet wormwoodor Chinese wormwood. The medical benefits of an infusion of qinghaosu (the traditionalname for artemisinin) were first discovered at least 2000 years ago by the Chinese,who used it to reduce fevers and other symptoms associated with malaria. However,the Chinese treatments using sweet wormwood were lost over time, and artemisininwas only recently scientifically identified as the active ingredient. During the Cultural Revolution in China in the late 1960s, Chairman Mao Tse Tung charged Chinese scientists to investigate ancient Chinese herbal remedies. Ho Chi Minhalso asked Mao to help provide new medicines to combat malaria, responsible formany deaths among Vietnamese soldiers during the Vietnam War. In the 1970s, anarchaeological dig unearthed recipes for ancient medical remedies, including onesusing artemisinin. The Chinese studied many types of traditional malaria cures before hitting on a recipe for tea made from the Artemisia plant. Distilling the tea and adding chemicals to try toisolate the active compound in the plant, they developed the medical remedy.The Chinese manufactured artemisinin in drug form and performed tests on malariapatients. It was discovered that artemisinin cleared malaria parasites from the hostbodies faster than any other antimalarial. Artemisinin derivatives have attributes that make them especially effective: they are highly potent, fast-acting (fever clearance is fast and people recover quickly), very welltolerated and complementary to other classes of treatment. Given that a minimum ofeighteen months is needed to grow the Artemisia plant from which artemisininderivatives are extracted, harvesting large quantities of the plant is critical forworldwide drug usage. Currently, most of the cultivation, extraction and synthesis forthe production of the drugs takes place in China and Vietnam, where the Artemisiaplant is grown. Artemisinin production is also beginning in Tanzania and India but full-scale production will take time. Drawn from \"Health: Can a Chinese herb win the malaria war?\" BBC Online Network, Thursday, October 15, 1998. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/194160.stm and information on www.artesunate.com.A crucial element of effective treatment of There is an urgent need for better rapid diagno toward treating confirmed cases only, thus sa > 12 ACT NOW - MSF 2003ACT NOW - MSF 2003 13Since artemisinins rapidly eliminate parasites from the bloodstream they limit the exposure of malaria parasitesto sub-therapeutic levels of the drug. 7When artemisinins are combined with an additional effective antimalarial, theremaining parasites are then killed by therapeuticconcentrations of this companion drug. Studies conductedin Africa have shown that, when artesunate was added toSP or amodiaquine treatment, parasite loads andgametocyte rates declined significantly faster. 8 Combining artemisinins with a companion drug also shortens the treatment course. Given alone, a full courseof treatment with artemisinins takes seven days. Becausepatients generally feel much better after just one or twodays of treatment, it is hard for them to comply to thislength of treatment. Given in combination with anothereffective antimalarial, the treatment is reduced to threedays. Choice of companion drug Today, artemisinins can be used in combination with SP, amodiaquine and mefloquine. A fixed dose combination ofartemether and lumefantrine also exists: Coartem orRiamet. In many parts of Africa, amodiaquine would bea suitable companion drug. Where resistance toamodiaquine and SP is already high, Coartem may be aviable solution (see WHO recommendation box page 12). Malaria epidemiology - including patterns of transmission, drug resistance and mosquito behavior -varies widely from country to country. Choice of treatmentmust be adapted to the specific setting and will dependon local drug resistance patterns, availability and price. In several West African countries, resistance to SP has not yet reached high levels: it may still be possible to delayresistance and extend the usefulness of SP by combiningit with artemisinin derivatives. In Southeast Asia, pre-existing resistance to mefloquine was stabilized andeventually reversed when it started to be used incombination with artesunate. 9 Artemisinins reduce transmission of malaria Not only do artemisinins help people feel better faster, they also may help reduce transmission of the disease.Artemisinin derivatives significantly reduce the load ofgametocytes, the infective form of the parasite, carried inthe blood. By doing so, they also reduce the likelihood oftransmission of the parasite. Studies in Southeast Asiasuggest that the use of an artesunate-mefloquinecombination reduced the incidence of P. falciparum malaria in the region. 10 In 2001, when ACT (Coartem, artemether plus lumefantrine) was implemented province-wide in KwaZuluNatal, South Africa, a study of gametocyte carriage wasundertaken. In a sample of 100 patients, the gametocyte carriage rate was 2%. Two years prior, treatment of 129patients with SP monotherapy left a 74% gametocytecarriage rate (See box page 15 for more on the KwaZuluNatal program). 11It is not known whether results would be as dramatic in African regions of high endemicity. Accurate diagnosis is critical A crucial element of effective treatment of malaria is proper diagnosis of the disease. In most of Africa,diagnosing malaria based on symptoms alone is normalpractice. This clinical diagnosis was actively promotedwhen malaria treatments were cheap, safe and easy to useand biological diagnosis was considered too complex andexpensive. However this method of diagnosis is veryinaccurate, as symptoms of malaria are non-specific andmay indicate the presence of other febrile infectiousdiseases. 12It is generally estimated that 50% of Africans who present with fever and are treated for malaria may infact not be infected with the malaria parasite. Clinicaldiagnosis may therefore needlessly increase treatmentcosts. It may also play a role in the development ofresistance. Accurate diagnosis of malaria using biological tests should be encouraged and supported as part of ACTimplementation. Biological diagnosis can be done through microscopic examination or rapid tests. Mircroscopy is time-intensive, particularly when the number of parasitesin the blood is low: the laboratory technician needs toexamine 100 fields in the microscope to be sure a slide isnegative. Although currently expensive, rapid diagnostic tests using a simple \"dipstick\" can greatly facilitate diagnosis ofmalaria. They can be read in just minutes, are simple tointerpret, and are easy to use in areas where medical andlaboratory facilities are minimal or non-existent. They havesome limitations in terms of accuracy, but can give anadequate sensitivity and specificity when combined withclinical diagnosis. There is an urgent need for rapid diagnostic tests with improved performance. Rapid diagnosis will facilitate themove toward treating confirmed cases only, thus savingresources and helping prevent resistance. Prices of thesediagnostics could be reduced by bulk purchasing.

Rapid diagnosis will facilitate the move ving resources and helping prevent resistance >African country response to increasing drug resistance: Which countries have changed protocols? MSF believes that countries who want and need to change should be offered support to move directly to ACT rather than to other, sub-optimal interim protocols; aside from the costs of the drugs themselves (see Part 3), which are substantially more expensive than non-ACT treatments, there are other significant costs involved in changing protocol which are the same regardless of the protocol chosen. Many countries are changing to combination therapy without artemisinins because they do not have donor support to make the more expensive change. 14 ACT NOW - MSF 2003drug resistance in Africa and on previous experience with ACT in Asian countries including Afghanistan, Cambodia,Myanmar, Pakistan and Thailand. In Africa, MSF is already using ACT in its projects in hospitals and therapeutic feeding centres in Angola, SierraLeone and the Democratic Republic of Congo; in refugeecamps and a focused outreach project in Zambia; in open-access clinics in Liberia, Kenya and Ivory Coast; in a sleepingsickness program in Congo-Brazzaville; and in MSF-supported clinics in southern Sudan. Coartem was usedvery successfully in the recent malaria epidemic in Burundi. In areas where it has been possible for MSF to start, careful monitoring is in progress to ascertain not only the efficacyof the drugs themselves, which is known to be very good,but also the effectiveness of different ways of managing drugadministration and use. Compliance studies will be used todetermine the best methods of managing treatment inprimary care, and follow-up microscopy will show how longpeople remain free of parasites in endemic settings. Theefficacy of treatment of patients with HIV will also be studied. Not 'if' but 'how' The right question is not \"if\" ACT can be effectively implemented in Africa, but \"how\" it can be best implemented.To refine implementation strategies, MSF is conductingoperational research and urges Ministries of Health in affectedcountries as well as NGOs to do the same. It is only by rigorously comparing program designs that we will be ableto improve results for individual patients and communities. Making the switch to ACT Several African governments have decided to change protocols (see chart page 14); KwaZulu Natal province inSouth Africa has successfully managed to change whileBurundi, Zambia, and Zanzibar in Tanzania are preparingfor implementation. Other countries, recognising theparasite resistance to their first-line protocol, have optedto change to another monotherapy or to non-ACTcombinations, primarily because of a lack of funds. MSF believes that countries who want and need to change should be offered support to move directly to ACTrather than to other, sub-optimal interim protocols; asidefrom the costs of the drugs themselves (see Part 3), whichare substantially more expensive than non-ACT treatments,there are other significant costs involved in changingprotocol which are the same regardless of the protocolchosen. Countries choosing a non-ACT alternative areincurring substantial costs while still not providingindividuals with the best possible treatment. To avoid this and others pitfalls endemic countries will need the support of the World Health Organisation and theinternational donor community.MSF has decided to implement artemisinin-based combination therapy for first-line treatment of all its malaria patients by the end of 2003>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGOERITREA ETHIOPIA KENYAUGANDA RWANDA BURUNDI ZAMBIA ZIMBABWE BOTSWANAMALAWI SOUTH AFRICACountries that have decided to change to Artemisinin-containing combination therapy (ACT) Countries that have changed to a combination therapy that does not contain artemisinins Countries that have changed from chloroquine to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) Non-African countries that have also switched to ACT: Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam Source: World Health Organization, 2003Zanzibar>>>KKwwaaZZuulluu NNaattaall \u2014\u2014 pprroovviinnccee--wwiiddee iimmpplleemmeennttaattiioonn ooff ACT in South Africa's KwaZulu Natal province has already had a dramatic affect on public health in the region. The implementation ofartemether-lumefantrine (Coartem) in February 2001, together with improved vectorcontrol measures, resulted in a dramatic reduction in malaria in the province: thenumber of malaria cases dropped from 41,786 in 2000 to 9,443 in 2001 (78%reduction). Between 2000 and 2001, admissions to Manguzi hospital in KwaZulu Natalfor malaria were cut by 82% and the number of reported malaria deaths decreased by87%. These remarkable improvements in malaria control and public health reflect the combined effect of residual household spraying with an effective insecticide in bothKwaZulu Natal and southern Mozambique, and the replacement of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), a drug that had become ineffective because of parasite resistancewith an effective ACT as the first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria. These early results from KwaZulu Natal are very encouraging. Their generalisability to areas of higher intensity transmission in Africa will be tested when ACT isimplemented at a district level in Namaacha district of southern Mozambique in 2003. The South East African Combination Antimalarial Therapy (SEACAT) evaluation is working with national malaria control programs to assess the feasibility and impact ofimplementing artemisinin-containing combination therapy (ACT) as first-line treatmentin South Africa, Mozambique, and potentially Swaziland. The evaluation involvesmonitoring therapeutic efficacy, resistance, gametocyte carriage, drug safety,treatment seeking, drug use (especially drug availability and patient adherence),distribution and intensity of malaria transmission, and the costs and cost-effectivenessof implementing ACT.The right question is not \"if\" ACT can be effectively implemented in Africa, but 'how' it can be bbeessttimplemented > ACT NOW - MSF 2003 15>>>\"African mothers don't realize that their children are dying needlessly, that donors could choose to fund effective treatment that would save their lives.\" Nick White Chairman, Wellcome Trust Southeast Asian Tropical Medicine Research Units and Professor of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol and Oxford Universities>>>making it a reality>>> >>> ACT The only current option 16 ACT NOW - MSF 2003\u00a9 roger jobW ACT NOW - MSF 2003 17amodiaquine have been about $1.50.4Yet, based on current price trends and historical experience, MSFestimates that the price of the artesunate-amodiaquinecombination should be $0.50-$0.80 by 2004-2005. 5As orders for the drug increase, the price of ACT will go downover time, becoming more and more affordable. The poor people who represent most of the continent's malaria disease burden cannot afford to pay much morethan what they currently pay for the old treatments, socosts must be subsidized by national governments withthe help of international donors. MSF estimates that provision of ACT for all African countries that need it today would cost about $US 100-200 million a year at today's drug prices. 6 International donors must step in and assist governments in meeting these funding gaps. MSFestimates that for five countries - Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi,Uganda and Tanzania - only $19 million in total would beneeded to switch to ACT instead of a sub-optimal interimprotocol. 7Nineteen million dollars may be a lot for the five countries, but with US and UK aid budgets of US $8.5billion 8and $5.25 billion,9respectively, these key international donors should easily be able to foot this bill.The US Agency for International development spends $586million on operating expenses alone. 10challenge to drug developers and producers. Once marketsare established by pooling orders and securing financing,producers will respond to the challenge. The WHO recommendation to use ACT in April 2001 was not followed up by securing the funds necessary to enticeEuropean, Indian, African, Vietnamese and Chineseproducers to scale up production. The World HealthOrganization, donors and involved governments must worktogether to encourage ACT production and to work withnew producers to assist them in meeting WHO qualitystandards. In Vietnam, where much of the Artemisia plantsare grown and raw material extracted, farmers are willingto plant additional acreage of this cash crop if they can beassured of demand. 12See box page 20 for more on challenges for ACT producers. The WHO pre-qualification process, which certifies qualified producers, has made a call for \"expression ofinterest\" to producers of ACT and is currently undergoingexaminations of products and facilities, but the future ofthe pre-qualification process is being put at risk by a lackof long-term funding. It will take political will and expressed commitment to generate a demand-driven cycle for quality ACT rawmaterial and finished products. (continued page 21)economically feasible for donorsFunding ACT for all of Africa is > > The Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, established in 2001, has awarded money to Zambia,Tanzania (Zanzibar) and Burundi for projects involving ACTtreatment during the first and second rounds of grants;while a promising initiative, the several millions of dollarsthat have so far been made available are a fraction of whatis needed for effective implementation of ACT in all theAfrican regions that need it today. The solution could comefrom an increase in bilateral and Global Fund money. TheUS$100-200 million necessary to provide ACT representsonly 1-2% of the US$10 billion the Global Fund hopes todisburse yearly. To date, the Global Fund has received US$3.3 billion in pledges, far short of this target. Yet, despite direct pleas from African governments, major international donors have so far been reticent to help payfor ACT implementation. 11Are international donors denying Africa's children the malaria treatment they would give totheir own sons and daughters? Availability - Current challenges and future possibilities Initial efforts to supply the first countries that have switched to ACT have been thwarted by a lack of suppliesof needed drugs. However, scaling up has begun and isfeasible. The technology needed for extracting the rawmaterial, and processing and formulating it not thatsophisticated. Even putting the combination drugs intoblister packs or into a single pill does not present a seriousWithout successful implementation of ACT now is significant progress on controlling malaria will be impossible.This is because there no miracle non-act combination waitingin the wings and because malaria control that consists ofprevention without effective treatment is doomed to failure.Despite this reality - and despite the rising mortality rates,despite the desire of many African governments to use drugcombinations that work, 1despite endorsement by the World Health Organization,2ACT is still not available to the vast majority of Africans who need it. We know which treatmentworks - so why do so few people have access to it? ACT treatment is currently much more expensive than other standard treatments; in addition, supplies of the drugare still limited. Yet both of these obstacles can beovercome. In fact, funding ACT treatment for all of Africa iseconomically feasible and scaling up production istechnically possible. What is missing is political will. Unless this changes, people will continue to die needlessly from taking drugs that no longer work. The money problem The cost of ACT is currently much higher than the previous \"gold standard\" treatments (eg, chloroquinemonotherapy). The cost of treating an adult withchloroquine or SP monotherapy is around US$0.10. 3The lowest quotes to humanitarian and governmentorganizations for combination therapy artesunate-18 ACT NOW - MSF 2003The cost of ACT as well as the limits of existing supplies are key areas where donors, agencies and governments could potentially make a real difference.Unfortunately, until now, in terms of articulated policy the donors have falleninto two camps. The \"leave it alone\" countries are the United States and theUnited Kingdom, which have spent considerable energy chronicling thebarriers to ACT introduction; 1and the rest of the donor community, which has \"no opinion.\" In other words, most countries have not actively supported theWorld Health Organization's recommendations to implement ACT now.They have been conspicuously silent on the issue. The \"leave it alone\" been studied more extensively than many other antimalarials,2 and it is estimated that about 2 million people have so far been treated with ACT, with little report of gross toxicity.3Not only have these drugs been used for more than ten years in Asia but there is also extensive safety as well as efficacy data from studiesconducted both in Asia and Africa. 4In a recently completed meta-analysis of artesunate based combinations versus the standard antimalaria drug alone, which included around5,000 patients and included sites in eight African countries, the combination showed aclear benefit in terms of reduction of risk of treatment failure, superior pharmacodynamicaction (parasite clearance and fever clearance), and reduction in gametocyte carriage. 5 Implementation of Coartem along with enhanced prevention measures in KwaZulu Natalhas resulted in remarkable improvements in malaria control and public health. 6 need to be additional studies in pregnant women the risks of using these drugs in pregnancies, even inadvertently, their use needs to be weighed against the risks ofusing older treatments or nothing at all. Plasmodium falciparum malaria can be particularly dangerous to mother and fetus during pregnancy, 7so it is important that work continue toward offering expectant mothers the best possible option. There is particularly a paucityof clinical data on the effects of artemisinin derivatives on women who are in the firsttrimester of pregnancy, but unfortunately the same problem plagues the use of oldertreatments such as SP. However, based on animal studies and on the clinical data that does>>>UnconvincingACT NOW - MSF 2003 19exist (including controlled trials in Asia and Africa which included hundreds of pregnant women among 15,000 participants8), the World Health Organization has already given the green light for use of artemisinin and its derivatives in the second and third trimesters.9 Considering the available data WHO experts have wisely recommended that artemisininderivatives not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy, if there is an effectivealternative. The same recommendation exists for SP. 10Other current options include chloroquine in the few places where resistance is not a problem and quinine, which iseffective but difficult to use and has significant side effects. The bottom line is that thereis no reason to withhold ACT from the general population because of concerns about use in pregnancy. >> presentation at a Roll Back Malaria partners meeting in February 2002, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) urged African governments to be conservative when consideringchanging their malaria policy - whenever possible, to \"leave it alone.\" 11The CDC presented a schema indicating that malaria program effectiveness would be higher with asingle-dose drug that was only 50% effective rather than a three-day treatment that was100% effective, essentially promoting SP monotherapy in areas where resistance hadalready developed. The CDC based its argument on an assumption that about 70% ofpeople would not complete a multi-day treatment course. Simply put, the argument statesthat, since people will not take a three-day course, lives can be saved by offering a lesseffective one-time treatment.As health professionals, MSF teams agree with CDC that compliance is a real challenge.For this reason we call on the international community to support endemic countries toimprove compliance. But let's not use this as an alibi to continue giving older, lessexpensive, less effective medicines.In KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, an ongoing evaluation of the combination ACT/DDT projectin place since February 2001 has already suggested that compliance to the three-day ACTregimen has had reasonable success and can, with continued support, be sustained. 12In a survey conducted in 2001 of about 2,500 households in KwaZulu Natal, 95% of recentcases self-reported completing their treatment. 15 for more on the KwaZulu Natal program.)The important issue is maximizing compliance to ACT treatment. This means, among otherthings, training health workers, improving packaging of medicines and offering it for freeor at affordable prices and improving patient education and information. In the long term,it also a company based in Switzerland, sells a fixed-dose ACT combination (artemether- lumefantrine), under the name Coartem. A WHO programme \"controls\" the supply of a discountedversion of this drug, at $2.40 per adult dose. Coartem is sold at about US$12 in private pharmacies indeveloping countries.Coartem challenge: 1) simplify the WHO process for obtaining access to discounted Coartem. 2) reduce the \"public\" and private prices Sanofi-Synth\u00e9labo , based in France, sells artesunate produced by the Chinese company Guilin under the trade name Arsumax on the African market. They have also had a blister of Arsumax andamodiaquine under development for more than a year, but have so far failed to produce any supply.In July 2002, Sanofi told MSF that they could fulfil large orders for this combination blister by December2002, but they are now saying that large quantities will not be available until September 2003.The company has also failed to file necessary paperwork to the WHO pre-qualification unit.Sanofi ACT challenge: 1) stop aggressively marketing the stand-alone artesunate product and 2) begin marketing the combination blister in needed quantities at an affordable price Asian Producers Mepha (a company based where???) has developed a combination blister of artesunate and mephloquine (for the Asian market) and is currently developing a combination blister of artesunate and amodiaquine for the African market. Indian producers Several Indian companies are in the process of developing ACT blisters. They include Ipca, Medicamen(in collaboration with Danikapharma/Mission Pharma) and Cipla.Indian producer challenges: 1) meet WHO, UNICEF and MSF quality requirements and 2) scale up production of artesunate in combination blister packs Vietnamese and Chinese producers Along with the Chinese, the Vietnameseare currently the leading extractors and synthesizers ofartemisinin derivative raw materials. In Vietnam, several of these raw material producers are investingin meeting international standards for the manufacturing of tablets and will likely offer cheaper finishedproducts by 2004. In China, the Guilin factory is the only one producing artesunate tablets. Thesetablets can only be purchased by non-profit institutions and governments for Africa (the private marketis by contract covered by Sanofi). African producers African producers will also be part of the solution. For example, the Kenyan pharmaceutical companyCosmos has already started production of artemisinin derivative, and the Artemesia plant is now beinggrown in Tanzania. Other African companies are likely to follow suit in the near future. *This is a non-exhaustive list of current producers of ACTIncreasing quantities of raw material for and scaling up production of artemisinin-based combinations is not a technical challenge. What is missing is political will> 20 ACT NOW - MSF 2003Artemisinins - no panacea Large-scale use of chloroquine and SP throughout much of Africa have led to rising levels of resistance. Isn't itreasonable to believe that artemisinin drugs will travel thesame path? If used alone there is a much higher risk ofthis. World Health Organization guidelines are clearlyrecommending combinations containing artemisinin drugs,rather than artemisinins alone. Conversely, since there areso few other drugs that work, it makes sense to protectthem by using them in combination with artemisinins. In Tanzania and Southern Sudan, where resistance to SP is still quite low, it makes sense to begin combining it withartesunate as soon as possible. When resistance to thecompanion drug is still very low, it is the ideal time tointroduce ACT, as treatment outcomes will be better andthe life of the companion drug will be prolonged. Artemisinin derivatives by themselves (not as part of a combination) are already widely available in privatepharmacies in many parts of Africa for people who can pay.This availability in monotherapy invites the developmentof resistance. The availability of ACT in public facilitieswould both set a treatment standard and reduce theinappropriate use of artesunate monotherapy byindividuals who are not currently being served by thepublic system. While we need to move forward as quickly as possibleto implement ACT, no drug combination lasts forever and increased levels of research are urgently needed.The non-profit sector has been hobbled by insufficientfinancing. The Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), aninstitution developing malaria drugs, claims that its biggestlimited factor is a lack of funds. To our knowledge, amongthe major multinational pharmaceutical companies, onlyGlaxoSmithKline, Bayer, Sanofi Novartis, and Jomaa PharmaGmbH have ongoing malaria drug development projects,and of these, only X and Y are for novel drugs. Using the \"non-compliance\" argument to prevent widespread implementation of the WHO-recommended treatment is a deadly double-standard. > ACT NOW - MSF 2003 2122 ACT NOW - MSF 2003\"If it [malaria treatment] costs more, the increased cost must be weighed against the broader social costs.
