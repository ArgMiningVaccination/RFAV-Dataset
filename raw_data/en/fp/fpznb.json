The moment we've all been waiting for: the New York proposed map.[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive407&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] [Here it is.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/democratic_proposal/) Some takeaways - the map is 22-4. Two of the tossups lean blue, so it could be 20-6 in a red wave. Here is the breakdown. - Lee Zeldin, who is retiring, has his district have a lean of D+6. Garabino, meanwhile, now has a solid red district at D+20. It used to be R+10 and R+8 respectively. - Nicole Matallokis will likely be ousted, as her district is now D+7. Before, it was R+13. - John Katko's seat is now D+13. While he initially had a D+4 seat and still won, this seems a bit too extreme even for a political moderate. - Now Antonio Delgado and Claudia Tenney's seats are merged (Tenney being notable for winning in 2020 by a mere 0.03%.) Before, Delgado was R+4 and Tenney was R+16 (but Delgado was a Democrat.) Now it is D+4, meaning Delgado is very likely to come out victorious. - The other three safe GOP seats is Stefanik (R+14 to R+23), Jacobs (R+21 to R+25) and Reed (R+15 to R+26). The other tossup is Democrat Maloney, who went from even to D+3. How did they do such a gerrymander? Well Matallokis's district now includes western Brooklyn, not just southwestern. Garabino's district is clearly packing all Republicans on Long Island into one seat, as Zeldin's district now punches deep into western Suffolk County. As such, as some of Suozzi's district is moved, it now also includes southern Westchester, making it go from D+6 to D+10. Now that Albany is cracked, it allows Delgado/Tenney's district to be more democrat leaning, but note Tonko goes from D+16 to D+12. It's clear Maloney's district now takes in some areas from previous Jones's, as that went from D+17 to D+10. Katko's district now clearly packs all democrats from Central New York, and shifts southwards. They then take leftover Republican areas and cram it into the 3 districts upstate. While this isn't a worst case scenario, the gerrymander is still pretty egregious, as it removes possibly 4 Republican seats in New York. This, as well as Florida, will be the biggest revealation of who will win redistricting, save for court battles.

[Comrade GC](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie) [Ministry of Praise](/wiki/User_talk:GrammarCommie)18:01, 31 January 2022 (UTC) - (EC) Trump's only skill in saying what he think people need to hear to get them to do what he wants. This is why he lies so much, and why he never keeps a promise, because once the moment has passed it no longer matters. Johnson has a carefully cultivated persona of a buffoon that he uses to get people on his side, from which point they instinctively support him. Any error of foible can be chalked up to that buffoonery, thus making him seem harmless and jolly. Some people claim that he's actually very astute underneath that fa\u00e7ade, but I think that's giving him too much credit. The reality behind the mask is just as vapid and just as bumbling, it's just less affable. He doesn't have the intelligence to behave any other way, even behind the persona. Therefore there's quite a difference between the two, despite superficial similarities.

Lying before Parliament was apparently once a serious thing before BoJo included it as part of his comedy routine.

[Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"Life is short and (insert adjective)\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M)12:15, 1 February 2022 (UTC) - It is certainly difficult to look at his various statements about Partygate and not come to the conclusion that some of them were lies to Parliament. - Here's something which I don't quite get. We are told that we must now wait for the outcome of the police report as they are apparently looking deeply into some specific - though not identified - issues. Presumably these are significant questions. - But, unless it's a really minor issue, the police don't say \"this man is guilty\". They refer the case to the the Crown Prosecution Service who then decide if the case should be processed by the legal system - which actually decides \"guilty\" or not. And during all this process the specific information should not be publicly available. And, of course, a case can go to appeal. - So, if my understanding is correct, it's not a question of \"waiting for the police investigation to finish\", but rather a question of \"waiting for the whole legal process to finish\". Which could very easily be months or longer. [Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"Life is short and (insert adjective)\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M)07:55, 1 February 2022 (UTC) - Personally think Johnson does have some genuine gifts re intelligence. Not as much as he thinks he has, but more than his opponents grant him. However, I suspect he's too much his own worst enemy; that his laziness, lack of self-control and selfishness are the cause of many of his own failings, be it political, personal or journalistic. However, as this is England we're so enthralled to the spirit of Churchill we're enamoured by a third-rate parody of him. - But ultimately, 'Partygate' isn't the thing which shall fell Johnson - it's his inability to marry up the demands of both Populists and Thatcherites in the party. We are already seeing the first scuffles regarding the competing demands re NI rises. Either he backs the Populists and is ousted by the ERG [most of the rebels are from this wing, like Baker, Frost, Davis etc], or picks the Thatcherites and is ousted in a GE. He shall pick the latter, as it's a) further away and b) he might be able to lie/cheat is way into another victory. - The main risk here is if he gets a leadership challenge from a truly viable alternative. Say what you will, but Johnson has done well in trashing the current stock of MPs to mean there's not many possibles who are neither corrupt, stupid, a wingnut or massively tainted by association. However, the Party might have gone so off it's rocker they might think Patel or Javid is a good idea... [KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 12:10, 1 February 2022 (UTC) - Yes. Identifying an actual \"better\" alternative is challenging. [Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"Life is short and (insert adjective)\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M)12:13, 1 February 2022 (UTC) - Finding a 'better' alternative who actually wants the job is even harder. If I was a 'realistic possible' I might desire Johnson to stay and stagger on, allowing him to collapse due to all the corruption/failure/lies to reach a kind of 'critial mass' and allowing me to do a clean sweep. There is also the threat that leading Tories decide that the only way to win again is to double down on all the BS; more lies, propaganda, unicorn promises and voter suppression tactics - and hope that alongside the boundary review shall allow them to squeak through again. - However, there's also the chance that our oligarchs won't be so eager to throw their lot in with the Tories again [esp if they get more loony], what with the promise of a 'Third Way Redux' minority administration under Starmer rather than an uber-evil socialist one from Corbyn. I have no proof yet, but I actually am starting to suspect our capitalist class is becoming more appreciative of stodgy, status quo democracies and are more unwilling to ride the altie tiger into full-blown authoritarianism than they were in the past. [KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 14:12, 1 February 2022 (UTC) - @ [KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice)I would heavily disagree. The upper classes are split between those who favor left-leaning social politics, in addition to some slight left-wing economics, and those who drank the fascist and neoreactionary koolaide. (Think Soros vs Thiel.) To attribute a shared narrative to them is a massive mistake. [Comrade GC](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie) [Ministry of Praise](/wiki/User_talk:GrammarCommie)16:42, 1 February 2022 (UTC) - @ - Yes. Identifying an actual \"better\" alternative is challenging. It seems that BoJo is floundering, but it may also be an attempt at tiring out public opinion by drawing out the process with this sudden interest by the Met (which had refused to investigate earlier, claiming there was no evidence and that it generally didn't investigate past COVID transgressions). Now, this may simply be the Met belatedly trying to look a bit less servile, but the bizarre decision to use the police enquiry to turn the Gray report (already a dubious project in and of itself) into a brief summary and some general criticism might also be a way to try to \"out process\" the current ire of the public. This strategy could backfire by keeping the scandal in the public eye continuously, but this drawing out of the pain gives wriggle room for BoJo and his supporters by offering the \"Now, we must wait for the final results of the Gray report/Met investigation\" escape hatch. The hope seems to be that the public will forgive BoJo for the umpteenth time and thus remove the pressure on Tories eager to keep their seats in Westminster, but it may also turn into a combination of water torture and death by a thousand cuts instead. Or the Tories simply want to let BoJo carry the can for a while and then knife him in order to run a \"new\" PM (cue a lot of \"turning over a new leaf\" and \"that's all in the past\" rhetoric) for the next election. Nevertheless, you should never underestimate the effect of the British media, which is mainly pro Tory, supplemented by some New Labour/LibDem outlets, like the Guardian. This means that any Tory leader will probably have a massive advantage, as long as BoJo doesn't get \"too Trump'ish\" in terms of the kind of chaotic incompetence that actually starts really hurting the bottom line of big players in the UK. If BoJo is tossed out by his own party, current odds would seem to favour Rishi Sunak, though arch opportunist Liz Truss also seems to want the job (she kind of reminds me of an even less principled and even more shamelessly opportunistic version of Theresa May). No matter what, I really doubt that any BoJo successor will attempt his style of \"pseudo-populist conservatism\" with all of its \"levelling up\" shtick. Expect a turn towards a more Thatcherite \"small gub'mint\" and austerity style rhetoric, as well as actual politics (not to mention that BoJo's populism has always been far more rhetoric than reality).

[[7]](https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2018/10/10-of-the-worlds-most-disgusting-foods/)I first had century egg when I worked at a Chinese restaurant in my youth. As is customary at many restaurants staff eat together before or after dinner service. My co-workers invited me to try the century egg as sort of a joke, I think. It was really not that bad and I ate most of it. I didn't know then that it is not usually eaten unadorned but used more like a seasoning in dishes. The other food durian gets a bad rap. It's the most divine fruit. I once ate 5 whole durians in one day during peak durian season out in a small town.

His entire schtick was that he wanted to replace all the secular-ish leaders of the Islamic world with one single Caliphate; the US was targeted to try and convince the US to abandon countries like Saudi Arabia so they were easier prey, not because Osama wanted to conquer everyone or anything like that. Well, he did want that, but it didn't need to be in his lifetime or the next century, just so long as the world was on that path. The point is, there wasn't a peaceful solution with the man.

We engaged with it as if it is one thing when it is in fact multiple things. This is a recurring problem with American foreign policy, especially in the middle east. We assume there is a singular \"Islam\" rather than a chaotic sea of \"Islams\" which we would then need to carefully navigate. And therein lies the problem.

That mistake is the belief that all non-western societies are educable as westerners: they can be made to act like western societies through social adjustments in schools and institutions and rituals. Societies that are able to mimic western cultures, as say Japan post WWII, may be handled in that manner. Others, like Afghanistan, are too culturally incoherent to be able to afford western values. They have their identities, and they are willing to fight for them. Don't worry if it does not make sense to you.

Or, it can refer to those cultures that are incoherent when interpreted from the POV of western values. An illustrative story about Afghan culture came out of a book I read long ago (can't remember the title or author). Anyway, the Germans had a number of nationals placed in Afghanistan at the end of WWII. The Allies ordered all nations with German nationals to surrender them to allied commands for processing. And failure to do so would result in dire consequences to recalcitrant parties and the Afghan government received an ultimatum stating that Afghanistan would be subject to military action if it did not comply with the order. Given the solemn regard all Afghans have concerning the proper treatment of guests, the government of Afghanistan determined it had no choice other than to declare war on the Allied nations that had threatened it's German guests, and issued a declaration of hostilities. Ultimately the Allies changed their attitude. [UncleKrampus](/wiki/User:UncleKrampus)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:UncleKrampus)) 21:21, 4 February 2022 (UTC) - @ [CorruptUser](/wiki/User:CorruptUser)That is partly incorrect. Yes, in my Afghanistan example, we see how not engaging with the local cultures as it actually is resulted in disaster. Yes, what we consider \"Afghanistan\" is more of a confederation of tribes and warlords than a nation in the liberal European sense. But when I say \"engage\" I mean in the sense of how we interact with it more broadly, not just diplomatically. That is to say, an understanding of the culture can provide important grounding for military and intelligence operations in the area. Hence my frustration with the idea that I am discounting the use of physical violence, when I very much am not. My concern is instead the thinking behind any of these courses of action, as that informs or misinforms how we engage in the aforementioned courses of action.

US soldiers in Afghanistan, as well as US command, operated as if these tribal factions were mere background elements to a federalized nation-state. This in turn led to us acting unknownly as muscle for various tribal feuds, leading us to target \"Taliban\" who were not, in fact, Taliban, but were instead members of rival tribes who we had unknowingly killed as part of ongoing hostilities. We did not understand the local systems and cultures, and therefore we did not know how to properly operate in the given area.

Calling yourself \"conservative\" in a Japan just a decade away from WWII and out from formal US occupation for just 3 years was probably never going to fly. Choosing \"liberal\" and \"democratic\" served several purposes, including signalling a mere merger of parties, making it easy for members of actual liberal parties to join, not to mention being able to claim the \"legitimist\" heritage of the various liberal parties back to the Meiji era, while avoiding the problematic, not to say outright discredited (at least at the time) formal label of \"conservatism\". - Other cases are similar results of historical developments with my favourite examples being the names of some Danish political parties. Directly translated, what is called the \"Left\" is actually a centre-right party (agrarian liberal, though more conservative in outlook these days); whereas the \"Radical Left\" is a centrist party (social liberal). Both of these names stem from the historical development \"from right to left\" of the Danish political spectrum: - Initially, the Left (agrarian liberal) party confronted the Right (conservative monarchists, with more than a tinge of Ancien R\u00e9gime) party, but a more radical fringe subsequently split from the Left to form the Radical Left (in an odd alliance between smallholders and intellectuals), before in turn being \"outflanked\" from its left by the labour movement (particularly the Social Democrats). However, the names of these two parties stuck around, whereas The Right changed its name to the Conservative Peoples Party (Denmark is big on people's parties, btw), but is often just called the Conservatives.

Expect COVID to turn into something similar. Causing death is not an advantageous outcome for viruses, just a side-effect. So as a virus mutates over time it's tends to be less lethal, improving its chances of propagating by keeping the host alive. Due to global failure in containment, expect COVID to eventually be something more like the flu. Advances in vaccines leading up to the pandemic, have increased vaccine production speeds and efficacy, so expect that people who get vaccinated will out-compete the unvaccinated over time.

However, bubonic plague has been a scourge for centuries, almost everywhere. There are far fewer cases of plague today than a century ago. - There was even a major plague outbreak that mainly affected port cities between around 1850-1900. - So, both statements are true. - Plague is different, though. It is rarely transmitted human to human. Mainly it is transmitted through infected fleas. As a result, hygiene and sanitation help a lot to control it. - It is also a bacteria driven disease, so these days, with antibiotics, it can be treated. - COVID-19 is a respiratory virus (not treatable with antibiotics, spreads from human to human easily). Mutating into an annoying, but usually not lethal form is what happened to the Spanish flu virus (H1N1). No reason to suspect this won't happen again, from what I read.

What Bongolian says is right, though with hindsight I don't think containment was ever a viable option. It could be said it was a kind of perfect storm; it arose at the start of the traditional 'flu season', shares many of it's symptoms with flu, a fair % don't have any symptoms, is highly contagious, was around at the block of time for mass travel/gatherings (Christmas/New Years) and while I don't give no truck to Chinese conspiracies, I do believe their original response was at a Chernobyl-level of mass denials due to heavy 'seagull management' which meant the rest of the world didn't get the alerts early enough. Though 'we' were hugely complacent too. Our defences had been denuded of resources for generations and what resources existed was to 'fight the last pandemic', which would have been the Swine Flu of '09. A series of 'near-misses' for the last 20 years may have also bred said complacency, along with the partly incorrect belief that infectious epidemics are a thing of the past. What's more, coronaviruses were a 'weak link' in our armour; as of '19 we still didn't have a vaccine for the '03 SARS and lack specialised treatments for MERS. Lastly, the populace had forgotten in advanced nations how to deal with infectious disease ie prevention. So... Covid shall go two ways. Either it shall flow around endemic within our species until we can finally nail it down with a vaccine which confers much better immunity or it shall recede... only to burst back on the scene once most folks immunity has waned. For the vast majority of infectious diseases don't vanish, they simply retreat back into a dark corner to bide their time. [KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 05:33, 6 February 2022 (UTC) - In point of fact containment is an option - it's what China does. But it's looking like an increasingly bad one for them. In their their autocratic society then can impose hard lockdowns in an instant - and they do that at the first case. - And the result has been that they can run their businesses. But the other result of low Covid infections has been low natural Covid resistance. That, added to the anecdotally worse effectiveness of the Chinese vaccines, means that they now lack a good exit strategy. - Although Omicron is generally gives milder symptoms it is (as I understand it) not clear if it is intrinsically milder or milder because of natural and vaccine-induced resistance. It looks to me like the latter, and after a couple more rounds of infections we may just learn to live with it.

Provisional conclusion - that Covid had already been well-seeded within the UK before the official alerts in early February. This theory explains why the hell I had all the Covid symptoms and then gave it to three others in mid-Jan. - COVID can end. But to end, it needs to rapidly ravage around 25% of the world in mere weeks. It would be too dangerous to let COVID end on it's own. Too many will die. - When it comes to the above policy, the best successes aren't China, but of Australia / New Zealand, followed by Taiwan and S Korea. This has been possible due to a very hot on the ball public health, their geographical position and traditions. With hindsight, that option was never really an option for the rest of us. - In regards to Omicron, it would *appear* that the UK's gamble of 'ride it out' is working, though our health services are truly knackered out. Perhaps a combination of vaccines + natural immunity from previous waves + current asymptomatic infections shall between them give enough protection for us... for awhile. - However, the thing which worries me is the 'learn to live with it' mentality.

With hindsight, I notice this from the cult lessons I got as a kid; it was much more about how to 'conform to expected habits' rather than to actually nurture and guide genuine faith. But this is an aspect - that church-cult shall envelop your entire life, your whole being - that non-culties shall not understand. - Oh no im so scared lol at any rate awesome good to know there's a diversity of beliefs here. What makes luciferianism different from Satanism anyways my head imagines it as being less \"edgy\", you likely know my views on the name.

He then goes on to call me a naive realist and say I wouldn't get it because I'm close minded. I know similar accusations are levied by people who promote woo or nonsense theories as a way to chide others for criticizing them.

Somebody who is presented with an idea they are already familiar with and have evaluated before may reject it out of hand without being closed-minded, if the new presentation does not add anything (significant) to what they have already considered.

When it's used as a defense mechanism, it often really means \"you need to open your mind to my argument, AND close your mind to arguments that oppose mine\" Well I say that because all the guy in the link above did was just call me a \"naive realist\" and that I \"wouldn't get it given my mental framework\" and kept insisting he explained himself in his post (he didn't, you can check for yourselves). It just sounded like since I wouldn't accept his, admittedly WOO, views about consciousness and reality that I was close minded. I told him I have no reason to believe his premises nor do they lead to his conclusion. He kept insisting solipsism works with superposition and I kept saying it doesn't because that's admitting to knowledge of something ELSE, which solipsism does not. It goes on and on capped by him saying that \"reality always conforms to our wishes as long as they don't break natural law, it's just that we often don't know what we are wishing for\" which was obviously wrong (I mean it doesn't take any critical thinking to do that). But every argument I made against him was just met with \"you don't get because 'naive realist' (as if that's some auto win button)\", when the reality is that I KNOW what he is talking about I just don't see why I should believe it nor is there evidence for me to believe. Then he said all proof is tautological, whatever that means. Honestly I don't know why I kept on when it was obvious nothing was getting through. I might have been abrasive but I argued my points and asked him to explain his, so I don't think I'm close-minded here. But it sounds like because I wouldn't accept his premises (one being that consciousness is primary) that I'm close-minded.

Also, I can't tell if you already know this, but 'naive realism' is something of a term of art, roughly corresponding to the view that the senses provide us with direct access to the external world ('naive' because it's the commonsense view most people take for granted). - In logic, a tautology is a formula that evaluates to true for every assignment of truth values to its basic constituents (e.g. p or not p is true whether or not p is true). \"All proof is tautological\" sounds like a bad excuse for refusing to justify a claim.

[Comrade GC](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie) [Ministry of Praise](/wiki/User_talk:GrammarCommie)14:18, 5 February 2022 (UTC) - Glass bottles/jars are reusable as well as recyclable. Also, even with Euro-level recycling levels the ecological weight of glass is a bit lighter over the whole lifecycle. With transport costs, cans win over bottles, but often with drinks which have travelled a long way said drink is transported by barrel and then bottled, so there's less weight difference. Plus, a barrel is much more sturdy than cans, so less wastage and less protective packaging. But neither is best; so if at a pub etc I shall select the drink from either a syrup pack or barrel. - Taste-wise, I don't mind canned.

Some relatively mild 'restrictions' may or may not be in force, mainly in the fields of mass gatherings and foreign travel. But calling them lockdowns is hyperbole. - 3/ - The lockdowns generally (a few exceptions exist, such as Aus/NZ) weren't aiming at 'eradication', but of 'flattening the curve' so health systems weren't overwhelmed. The UK 'gamble' has shown that Omicron + mass vaccination coverage - significant restrictions = 'manageable' Covid hospitalisation rates. Therefore, mass vaccination cover is the key bit. Thus, the carrot/stick approach for getting those vaccinations. - 4/ - The cynical view can be that allowing the refuseniks to get their immunity 'naturally' can top up the resistance in the general population, which with any luck shall allow us to move to the next phase; endemic but with mitigations, while we wait for a vaccine which can break the transmition cycles for good.

Bit of a history lesson, and a lesson into the nature of humanity. There were numerous attempts to establish settlements in what are now the US and Canada from the very beginning, but until Jamestown, they all ended in failure. The first attempts were made up of upper-class \"gentlemen\" along with their manservants, and unskilled petty crooks who were desperate to find a new life for themselves. Notably, skilled professionals were absent from those populations, because those people were too busy living relatively comfortable lives back home, making a decent living. And while it might not seem like an advanced skill, farming and fishing were among those skills that were curiously absent, and just because the people who do those skills are \"simple\" does not mean anyone could pick up those skills in a matter of days. In other words, the colonists doomed themselves to starvation. In the case of Jamestown, the settlement was constantly resupplied by other voyages, and pretty much within the year a number of actually skilled Polish and Germans just happened to arrive in the colony; this multi-cultural part gets erased from the history books because non-English. Even so, for the first few winters half the colony still died off, to be devoured by those who survived, and kept getting replenished with new people. None of the first few women survived; some speculate there were more than a few cases of outright murder for food. To remedy this, the King rounded up a bunch of prostitutes and sent them to Jamestown in lieu of other punishment. If you trace your lineage to the original colonists, your ancestors were cannibals, hookers, and cannibalistic hookers. Eventually the colony established itself and figured out the whole \"not starving\" thing, but it took some time. Plymouth was also interesting, in that it only survived through the dumb luck of getting involved in Native politics and one of the local kings (yes, the native tribes had kings too) keeping them alive in the hopes they would help him balance the power against his rivals. That kinda worked, a bit better than he had hoped, but that's another story. But what does this have to do with human nature? These people were not any different than the people today. All those idiots who think they know more than everyone else, only to do something incredibly foolish with no actual planning? They existed back then too. Only, they got themselves killed. Just an interesting bit of history. [Cordon](/wiki/User:CorruptUser) [ (pester)](/wiki/User_talk:CorruptUser) 16:24, 8 February 2022 (UTC) - There's no such thing as \"human nature\".

The first big economic success not based on some form of precious metal extraction would be the sugar plantations of the Caribbean (although you could also count the fisheries on the Grand Banks), whereas mainland North America had to wait for the \"tobacco rush\" to find something that was more lucrative than subsistence farming and similar activities.

While Jew's harps were ubiquitous throughout Eurasia, North Africa, and Polynesia, and some people in the Americas independently developed mouth bows (though not in Brazil, West Africans there probably invented the berimbau), no one had ever developed one in the Americas. Accordingly, the recipients pretty much universally misunderstood the purpose of them, so instead of using them as instruments they gave them to their kids to use as noisemaker toys. In other cases, as with the Apache, they took the idea of violins (other than mouth bows the Americas have no native pre-Columbian string instruments) and turned them into [Apache fiddles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_fiddle).

The natives, meanwhile, had all these furs that were basically viewed almost like trash, and were more than willing to trade the worthless things for such intricate commodities as metal cooking utensils, glass beads, cinnabar, etc, that Europeans had viewed as cheap throwaway goods. One of the problems was that the fur trade was so valuable for the natives that - Essentially, the early attraction of \"The Americas\" was the lure of such \"get rich quick\" schemes and only after it became clear that there were no (more) fabulous riches to be had and with the arrival of various dissidents and other misfits did the attention turn to colonisation. The first big economic success not based on some form of precious metal extraction would be the sugar plantations of the Caribbean (although you could also count the fisheries on the Grand Banks), whereas mainland North America had to wait for the \"tobacco rush\" to find something that was more lucrative than subsistence farming and similar activities. I think the OP is overfitting somewhat. Most, though not all the early settlement attempts did include folks with 'decent skills'; for the average European at this stage was much more self-sufficient re skill-sets. But you're right in the respect there was not enough of them, far too many folks who signed on were or marginal or nil worth at that point and there was too many unknowns. There were also problems; some resupply ships failed to arrive, others brought the wrong cargos. Lastly, communications were so poor - early colonies 2 years was an normal turn-around time. Which was too long if you'd discovered - like the did in New England - that the 'English' grain you'd brought cannot survive in the harsher Massachusetts winters. But more generally, their main problem was economic. The colonists were under-capitalised (in all ways), because better 'opportunities' lay closer to home. This meant they had too many mavericks, chancers and desperate as colonists, not enough solid, sturdy folks. There was not enough people/cash investment in the colonies to produce both cash crops and food, and the former was vital to attract continued investment, like any other business. Colony attempts normally started to 'stick' once either big businesses started to get into it or the state. Ones who had enough cash, clout and expertise to overcome the hurdles. Which can be seen in any field of human endeavour.

After all, Truman did end up leaving Seahaven despite almost everything/one doing their damn best to make him 'happy' in his belljar and to encourage him to stay. I'm loathe to say 'human nature' as a reason for anything, but in this case I think it's true. We as a species need a few oddballs who'll ignore the wisdom of the majority and the allure of a quiet life and go and try new things, which sometimes pan out and help us advance as a civilisation. But back to the colonisation point. Part of the problem was in the first wave it was truly the wildcard option - other, better things were on offer. Esp if you were skilled and/or had a bit of capital behind you. Why the hell should I, sturdy yeoman farmer give up everything to put a bet on the long shot? It would be better for me to go into farming here in England, or if feeling a bit adventurous sign on to one of the 'plantations' in Ireland. Europe in 1600 still had a lot of waste land and empty spaces to settle. As for Columbus... did you know two of the main reasons he fell out of favour with the Spanish? One was that he didn't find either the mountains of gold or lucrative route to Asia, but the other was that basically, the settlement of Hispanola failed (mainly due to events outside of his control) and the ex-colonists were mainly back in Spain, broke and spitting poison.

You can then practice by reading text out loud, without paying attention to vocabulary or grammar. I use foreign Wikipedia language editions as practice. If you want to perfect your pronunciation further, you can find phonology textbooks or phonology research papers of the language you want to learn. I was able to roughly read the Korean alphabet, Cyrillic alphabet and Japanese kanas that way.

For alphabets with minimal reform, it'll probably be harder. For example, in French, the letter W in the word \u00ab wagon \u00bb is pronounced with a V sound. The only way to know for sure would be to check the pronunciation in a dictionary.

For Chinese characters (not alphabetical), I found an easy cheat was to ignore the radicals as the Japanese seem to and use instead a system for typing Kanji. - If the alphabet was recently reformed, like the Korean alphabet and Japanese syllabary were after World War II, then the pronunciation isn't very difficult; the letters of a word would match closely to the actual pronunciation. For alphabets with minimal reform, it'll probably be harder. For example, in French, the letter W in the word \u00ab wagon \u00bb is pronounced with a V sound. The only way to know for sure would be to check the pronunciation in a dictionary. - Okay. Non-Latin alphabets easily throw me off. -- [ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive407&action=edit\u00a7ion=36)] [https://www.dailywire.com/news/the-big-government-covid-19-lie](https://www.dailywire.com/news/the-big-government-covid-19-lie) worth reading.

I think it would have been more interesting if the head conspiracy guy in Human Revolution (the radio host) was a politician who was using the paranoia to fuel a grassroots movement to seal more power. If he was behind some of the shady dealings of the corporation and playing both sides in order to facilitate a panic of useful idiots, I think it would have been a fun sort of self fulfilling prophesy. \"If you are paranoid and always hunting for grand conspiracies, than you will get what you wish for.\" This would have been reflexive of how large conspiracies, such as the Nazi takeover of Germany relied upon having a perceive conspiracy to justify its own takeover.

It made its way around the rumor mill due to [COVID-19](/wiki/COVID-19)conspiracy theorists misunderstanding things as usual. - A couple of points: - A) [Bill Gates](/wiki/Bill_Gates)is but one member of a very large tech ecosystem filled with many companies. Have you ever heard of [Accenture?](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-blockchain-id2020) [Mastercard?](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/mastercard-joins-blockchain-digital-identity-alliance-id2020/) [Facebook?](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/facebook-joins-digital-identity-alliance-id2020/)(Cisco as well per the Wiki, though no link on their site.) They are also a part of ID2020. On Wikipedia, ID2020 didn't even have its own page until COVID-19 (due to the conspirators).

Not dinosaurs either, but my understanding is that crocodilians as a whole are very little changed from the time of the dinosaurs. - Last time I saw my older brother he spent about 5 hours explaining minutia of the different in bone layouts between lizards and dinosaurs when I mistaking conflated the two. I had known birds were descended from dinosaurs, but it was interesting seeing how the bone structures follow chronologically from one another. It is always weird talking to my brother, because he is an artist on the side who draws realistic skeletons based on fossil evidence, but he is also a young earth creationist who completely compartmentalises his knowledge about species descendancy and his religious beliefs apart from each other. - get some chickens. - you dont even have to exit via the gift shop either (though it will be close to the main exit, and they usually have some interesting things there, even if you dont have cash, its nice to browse) [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:AMassiveGay)) 22:41, 15 February 2022 (UTC) - Are most of those free ones government funded or something?

It's an archival project and website that works with (and has a \"deemphasized collection\" within) the Internet Archive. Unsurprisingly, it's full of all kinds of alt-right, conspiracist, fundie, and COVID-denialist stuff. You can, for example, see [a page for](https://altcensored.com/channel/UCAhmDfQ1LfOYECmNNWgXJ7Q) David Icke's now-deleted YouTube channel there, and the videos which used to be on it. While altCensored is currently mentioned briefly on [RationalWiki:Webshites/Racialism](/wiki/RationalWiki:Webshites/Racialism), I don't think it's a good categorization, since it both contains more types of webshite content than that, and is dedicated to an \"unbiased\" archiving of all kinds of stuff censored from YouTube (accepting submitted suggestions of channels at risk of deletion to monitor). I actually think it's neat, in a way, that such a project exists, since the web has a much worse memory for video content in general than it does for websites. Decades from now, whether or not the altCensored website is still there or not, assuming the Internet Archive is still there, through its connection to the latter people around the world will be able to have a more direct look at some of the cream of the crap of \"viral\" cultural currents during our current feverish little age. -- [ApooftGnegiol](/wiki/User:ApooftGnegiol) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:ApooftGnegiol)) 17:13, 16 February 2022 (UTC) - 1) It's slow-loading. 2) There's no indication of who's behind it. 3) It seems to be primarily funded by Bitcoin donations, so inherently unstable. 4) Internet Archive seems to have gotten better about archiving YouTube videos than they were a few years ago.

And as Pan points out, it is a confusing and complicated issue; I noticed this over the whole Prince Harry/Markle thing when their first kid was born - hearing people referring to said sprog as 'black' which made me wonder if we'd regressed here too and one-drop rules were back or something. Yet as said kid is ~75% white, does that mean if they later ID as 'black' they're transracial? How thin do we have to cut these genetic slithers before it becomes 'wrong'? Is it wrong period to truly ID as a 'race' which is not genetically your own? - Before this was a troll term, it was largely used primarily for parents who adopted a child (\"transracial adoption\"), and even there I personally don't think that's a great term for the phenomenon given the flimsy genetic construct of race (whee, more melanin, whoop-de-shit...).

I really can't think of one. I'm not talking about LGBT - it's such a wide term to be almost meaningless these days. And you're right, sexuality has near nil to do with... hmm, let's call it 'racial dysphoria'. I say this for one simple reason; a gay/lesbian/bi person could without almost nil effort 'claim' straightness (either some or all the time), while a fully transitioned person can hardly 'reclaim' their original gender as/when they like. I'm only drawing a possible parallel with 'gender dysphoria' for they do share some attributes - disagreement with genetics, a strong 'identification' with another 'type' and a sense of disconnect with their current one. What's more, they both share attributes with other dysmorphias in that they can drive people to 'absurd' (to outsiders) lengths to correct the problems etc. As for the causes... well gender dysphoria's are still unknown, and racial dysphoria is not even accepted as existing. So we cannot cite that either. And standing by 'biological characteristics' is a very dodgy place to be, because that is one of the defence lines of TERFs use. I'm starting to think that the issue here is in fact that racial dysphoria / transracialism breaks a core rule of 'our' world; both personally and societally. Thus, we instinctually feel that it's 'wrong' but (I at least) am finding it impossible to refute it logically without leaving self open to doing doublethink re gender. What the OP thinks I'm not really bothered with. I shall say on the balance of probability they did deserve the collapse.

[KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 18:29, 14 February 2022 (UTC) - I will complicate this by adding that I have seen [one article](https://theconversation.com/is-changing-ones-race-a-sign-of-mental-health-problems-66015)(disclaimer: from a sociologist) that linked to a [ThinkProgress piece](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/how-scientists-explain-rachel-dolezal-4a2ed99165ef/)(disclaimer: from a journalist) regarding the curious case of [Rachel Dolezal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Dolezal), a white person who self-identified as black. \" [Body dysmorphic disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder)\" was brought up in one piece, and [racial fluidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racial_fluidity)was brought up in the other.

So maybe we'll find out more in the future. That being said, I do kind of agree with [this Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/27/rachel-dolezal-race-white)that there is a bit of a one way street going on with Dolezal. While there is a lot of social construct in race, the physical characteristics remain a big f'n deal in cultures where it is accepted to be a racist asshat on shallow reasons like skin color. As an American white guy, I can easily hide things like my \"Evil\" Atheism among the bigoted. It's impossible, in contrast, to hide the color of one's skin among the racist. [PanGalacticGargleBlaster](/wiki/User:PanGalacticGargleBlaster)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:PanGalacticGargleBlaster)) 19:18, 14 February 2022 (UTC) - Ethnicity just refers to your ancestors' cultural heritage and all. If your father and mother were both accepted as \"Italian\" by other Italians, it doesn't actually matter if your father's ancestors were in part Viking invaders (which how you got redheaded Italians) or your mother's ancestors were a mix of Arab traders (which is how you got swarthy Sicilians), you are still 100% Italian even though genetically you are a mutt. That's the problem with trying to determine \"race\", because if you were to dig up an ancient Frenchman you'd find he also had a lot of Germanic, Iberian and Italian tribes in his bloodline, there's no such thing as someone who is genetically French even though there is such a thing as being ethnically French.

[KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 23:24, 14 February 2022 (UTC) - Personally, I find it more helpful to think of gender dysphoria and intersex and whatnot as more of as \"another gender\" (as other cultures do, for instance, India has the term [hijra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia))). To me you're showing an example of why using the Western gender binary terms can be problematic, people get too attached to the idea of sorting into a male/female bucket. In reality it's only a \"gender change\" more because that's how Western language and society has set things up. [PanGalacticGargleBlaster](/wiki/User:PanGalacticGargleBlaster)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:PanGalacticGargleBlaster)) 14:14, 15 February 2022 (UTC) - Personally, I find it more helpful to think of gender dysphoria and intersex and whatnot as more of as \"another gender\" (as other cultures do, for instance, India has the term - \"I (a - The issue here, though, is that while it's acceptable for a mixed-race person to identify as one or the other, since they belong to both groups, OP/T is attempting to identify as a totally different race by essentially appropriating it onto themselves, which is not how it works. Race is a social construct but it's not fluid if you specifically belong to one group, I think. I (a white person) can't go around calling myself Asian, can I? No. I don't have that ethnic makeup, and I can't claim it. - Do you guys think this issue could be better explored in children of mixed couples where they can pass as one race but not the other? --It's-a me, - Ethnicity just refers to your ancestors' cultural heritage and all. If your father and mother were both accepted as \"Italian\" by other Italians, it doesn't actually matter if your father's ancestors were in part Viking invaders (which how you got redheaded Italians) or your mother's ancestors were a mix of Arab traders (which is how you got swarthy Sicilians), you are still 100% Italian even though genetically you are a mutt. That's the problem with trying to determine \"race\", because if you were to dig up an ancient Frenchman you'd find he also had a lot of Germanic, Iberian and Italian tribes in his bloodline, there's no such thing as someone who is genetically French even though there is such a thing as being ethnically French. - The problem with claiming to identify as black is, \"black\" does not reference any real identity. The only referent for \"black\" is the color of the skin. It is not in anyway biologically or culturally determinative. Now I could say that I identify as Nigerian, and I would not need to have a dark skin to do so. If I spoke to you over the phone with a baritone Nigerian accent you would certainly assume that I were a black man. I would certainly be a Nigerian if I were born in Nigeria, no matter what my skin color might be. I might also be classified as \"African,\" on immigration or travel papers. A dark suntan and a passport photo might show me as very dark-skinned. If I grew up with people who accepted me and refrained from making me self conscious of my whiteness, I might be motivated to say \"I am black.\" Yet I would not actually be black. Being black is more than an idea about a person's appearance. There are many kinds of \"being black.\" The black people of Chicago are not like the black people of [Austrailia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Australians), nor like the black people who live in [India](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20160801-indias-forgotten-jungle-dwellers). Transgender people make a very different identification. Masculine and feminine personality aspects amount to different modes of being. Blackness is always attached to a cultural identity of some sort and the universality of blackness is concept without a real object. [UncleKrampus](/wiki/User:UncleKrampus)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:UncleKrampus)) 23:46, 14 February 2022 (UTC) - That argument makes no sense. - 1/- Definitions of 'masculinity' and 'femininity' are not fixed either, varying from both countries and generations. - 2/- 'Different modes of being'? - 3/- I, and nobody else claimed there to be a 'universality of blackness'. First off, that reeks of the old American idea (dating back to Jim Crow) where anybody not clearly pasty of hue was 'black' regardless. What's more, folks ID themselves more rigidly than that; 'Black British', 'African-American' and so on. These terms have more meaning than simple skin hue; it states at least some affinity to that group, and socio-cultural-historical overlap with the others of your 'community'. So this answers your point about it being 'more than an idea about a person's appearance'. This was partly the reason for the slight African-American kickback against Obama's IDing as such when he first came onto the scene; not because of his genetics, but the fact he didn't have as much overlap for the intangable bits for the mainstream of 'African-American experience' for their liking. [KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 06:20, 15 February 2022 (UTC) - Gender and race are very different. Yes, both are, by some extent, social constructs, but there's a difference between expression of gender and expression of culture. I can't just project any kind of cultural identity onto myself, because it would invalidate the experiences of those who actually belong to it. Like, I'm 1/4 Jewish and grew up never practicing or really knowing about it, so calling myself Jewish is inaccurate, since I don't have the personal experience of the culture. Replace Jewish with anything else you'd like, same concept there. [Jake Holmes](/wiki/User:TheJakeHolmesVersion) [yell at me](/wiki/User_talk:TheJakeHolmesVersion)14:39, 15 February 2022 (UTC) - \"Gender and race are very different.\" How? Saying that is one thing, but I need some solid argument here (which is the point; I can't find one which stands up). - \"I'm 1/4 Jewish and grew up never practicing or really knowing about it, so calling myself Jewish is inaccurate.\" What if you start to attend your local synagogue, take instruction from a rabbi, learn Hebrew, perhaps 'convert' if you don't fill the definition of being able to 'inherit' Jewishness? (I shall accept the majority definition of here, even though I hold it's simply a religion). Yet the above is also open to me, even though I'm 90% sure there's not a drop of 'Jewish' blood within me (10% taking into account London's old melting-pot). The point being, if we *identify* as Jewish, throw yourself into it's culture and other Jews accept this, we become members, no? - And if we start going on DNA percentages, how thin do we cut here? Let's say I'm 1/8 Jewish; good enough? What if that 1/8th was a *convert*, still good enough? Or perhaps converted to Christianity? What if it's 1/16? What if you're only 1/4th, but you were raised by that Jewish grandparent exclusively, so ID strongly? Or you were adopted, so you are 0% Jewish really? I'm reminded here of the Native American tribes which long accepted decendents of adoptees as members... right up to the point European norms/rules were applied, and some folks started to be 'disenrolled', like the Cherokee freemen. Simply on blood, not culture or identification. [KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 18:16, 15 February 2022 (UTC) - I'm going to assume that you are not gaslighting here. Masculine and feminine afford different modes of being. You say the definitions are different in different countries and generations. The fact that they are actually different from one another seems to have evaded you. If you are uncomfortable with the language of Spinoza, then simply consider different modes of being as distinct manifestations of conscious reality. Race is a construct with real world content. If you are 25% Jewish, that is say, one of your grandparents was Jewish, if that Grandparent was one of your grandmothers then by Jewish law you are Jewish whether you like it or not. It is not a question of your personal identity. Jewish Law doesn't give a shit who you think you are in that respect. The \"universality of blackness\" comment was an elucidation of the idea that being black is not being a member of a race. Complain complain complain. Pick up a book if you don't want to learn anything here. [UncleKrampus](/wiki/User:UncleKrampus)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:UncleKrampus)) 19:04, 15 February 2022 (UTC) - 1/ - Hint, when someone says 'I do not get that statement' / 'what does than mean?' simply repeating it doesn't make it suddenly clear as day. - 2/ - No, I do get that males and females are 'different'. Don't talk down to me. I'm reasonably intelligent and educated, and your 'answer' looks to be waffly academese designed to obfuscate the true answer - 'it's different because I say it is'. - 3/ - The last sentence increases that; telling me that I should DYOR is difficult because - as GC pointed out - there's barely anything on this topic. Hinting that I'm simply 'complaining' is somewhat true - the whole basis of this was the fact I cannot find an argument which denies Rachel Dolezal right to be African-American while granting it to Caitlyn Jenner's right to be a woman. And oddly enough, I do try to avoid being conciously hypocritical in views etc. - 4/ - Doing the non-accusation of gaslighting shows a shift from the topic to the person, which is not the best look. - 5/ - Doing an attack on my 'what is a Jew?' point (mine is a minority, but not a minority of one) is utterly beside the point being discussed. - 6/ - But... now you said it - are you saying that the group itself has the right to define membership, using whatever critera it desires? So it was wrong for the Cherokee freemen to be legally stripped of their identity due to a 'foreign' rule being imposed? And that it was wrong for Dolezal, for she'd been accepted as 'one of us' by the local African-American community? - 7/ - Interestingly, the only book I could find - ['Unsettled Identities'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trans-Gender-Race-Unsettled-Identities/dp/0691172358)does not (according to the academic review I read) to help your 'point' - at best, it seems to say 'more study is needed' (it is now on my book-purchase list, though there's a long wait-time in it right now). And I will read Tuvel's Hypatia essay when I get time - but I did already did read some of the kickback to it, which led to my earlier point that the main complaints to her essay seemed to be windy and jargonse ways of saying 'I don't like your conclusions so they must be wrong.'. I'm sorry, not liking the conclusion is not legitimate grounds for it's dismissal. At least, not by itself. [KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 20:49, 15 February 2022 (UTC) - Don't take it personally. If you don't get it at first, that's not a problem. Sometimes ideas take years to mature in ones mind. Since you like to itemize, let us proceed. - I'm going to assume that you are not gaslighting here. Masculine and feminine afford different modes of being. You say the definitions are different in different countries and generations. The fact that they are actually different from one another seems to have evaded you.

Replace Jewish with anything else you'd like, same concept there. - 1 &2,The explanation does not repeat the original statement. We know that males and females are essentially different. The difference in various communities and societies is a matter of style and custom. The important fact is they are invariably different and each class is more similar to the same class in another culture than it is to the other class. This is a statement that can never be made about strictly cultural differences. 3) It never hurts to do some reading. I explained that rights have little to do with the question you ask. A person can say they are black if they are white. But if black people don't accept it, then you have a real problem no? You do have a right to call yourself anything. If no one believes you, then that is a true problem for you. 4) Don't be paranoid son, I said I would assume you are serious. 5) The who is a Jew question is interesting, and people don't always agree. It is an example of living with ambiguity. Also, it wasn't an a \"attack.\" 6) I am not saying any such thing as a group has the right to identify it's members, unless, of course it is a formal group with rules for membership, like the Elks (B.P.O.E.). 7) So since more study is needed, I hope you get started, since answering your own questions is the best way to learn what you can accept. And believe me, not everyone accepts the same explanations. I personally do my best to accept as many as I can. [UncleKrampus](/wiki/User:UncleKrampus)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:UncleKrampus)) 21:42, 15 February 2022 (UTC) - 1/ - 'We know that males and females are essentially different.' I see. So you don't think trans people exist then? - 2/ - Read *what* exactly? Were you not paying attention to the points that there's barely any study on 'transracialism' / 'racial dysphoria'? Or are *you* well-read on this topic and would care to show all the myriad of sources on this that I've apparently missed? - 3/ - If you assumed I was serious, then why *did* you bring up gaslighting, then? It smells plain wierd. - 4/ - Like how you grant my 'who is a Jew' example as 'interesting' then don't mention the other two examples. But 'You do have a right to call yourself anything.' could in fact be taken to support Dolezal's claim, yes? - 5/ - Your comment about 'Jewish Law' says otherwise regarding 'I am not saying any such thing as a group has the right to identify it's members'. Either Jewish Law (ie Jews) have the ability to rule membership *or* they do not. You cannot have your logical cake both ways. At least, not without a decent reason. - 6/ - As for 'more study is needed', I meant more done by professionals. As already said, I shall read the essay when I can and the book when it gets to the top of my order list, but this is one of those few things where I think *there is not yet any consensus on the subject*. I've seen plenty of 'feels' hidden under waffle of why gender and race IDs are completely different but no compelling logical argument. And I'm fighting these feels myself; as in 'Dolezal was wrong'. [KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 00:36, 16 February 2022 (UTC) - 1) That conclusion would be unsound. We are using paradigms here not writing an encyclopedia. - 2) Reading is always good. We can all get better, and since your are anxious to know more, you must study. If there is almost nothing written about transracialism, then there has been almost nothing reliable found to say about the subject. Seems obvious enough. You can start by reading up on the history of [race science](https://apa.nyu.edu/hauntedfiles/about/timeline/). It might give you ideas. - 3) I said I was willing to assume you were serious. You are the one who proves you are serious. - 4) He can call himself anything (Dolezal). But that don't mean much if it is not accepted. There has to be real world content to any meaningful statement. If I say my mother was a monkey, you might say \"Funny, you look like a person.\" Would that make you suspicious? - 5) You are not paying attention: \" I am not saying any such thing as a group has the right to identify it's members, unless, of course it is a formal group with rules for membership, like the Elks.\" That would include various sects of Judaism, I believe. - 6) The reason you can't see a compelling logical argument is the arguments are based upon experience and are empirical rather than rationalist. Classes of behavior seem to go together. This is necessary in psychological theory. Psychologists do from time to time fail to diagnose their patient's problems. Gender based phenomena are not entirely deontological, that is, their identity cannot always be discovered using an algorithm (what you call a logical argument). - Don't worry about not understanding. General ideas are hard for us to grasp, while personal conditions of others are often difficult for us to recognize. Life seems at an very low entropic state at times. Hang in there, and cheer up will you? [UncleKrampus](/wiki/User:UncleKrampus)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:UncleKrampus)) 23:42, 16 February 2022 (UTC) "}
