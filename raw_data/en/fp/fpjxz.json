Symptoms of COVID-19 People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported - ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms. Possible symptoms include: - Fever or chills - Cough - Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing - Fatigue - Muscle or body aches - Headache - New loss of taste or smell - Sore throat - Congestion or runny nose - Nausea or vomiting - Diarrhea This list does not include all possible symptoms. Symptoms may change with new COVID-19 variants and can vary depending on vaccination status. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. [Older adults](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/covid19/) and people who have underlying [medical conditions](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) like heart or lung disease or diabetes are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19. Feeling Sick? If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, consider the following options: [Get tested for COVID-19](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html) - If you have already tested positive for COVID-19, learn more about CDC's [isolation guidance](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html) When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID 19: - Trouble breathing - Persistent pain or pressure in the chest - New confusion - Inability to wake or stay awake - Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone If someone is showing any of these signs, call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility. Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19. *This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. You cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 by symptoms alone because some of the symptoms are the same. Some PCR tests can differentiate between flu and COVID-19 at the same time. If one of these tests is not available, many [testing locations](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.html) provide flu and COVID-19 tests separately. Talk to a healthcare provider about getting tested for both flu and COVID-19 if you have symptoms.
