These properties make [broccoli an effective therapeutic agent](https://www.emedihealth.com/nutrition/health-benefits-broccoli) in the treatment of various bacterial and viral infections. [(10)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7867070/) 8. Papaya consumption can bolster immunity Many studies have demonstrated the [immunomodulatory properties of papaya extracts (leaf and seed)](https://www.emedihealth.com/nutrition/health-benefits-of-papaya-and-seeds) in various cell types exposed to a variety of stressors. Papaya has been used effectively in the treatment of dengue fever, malaria, and fungal diseases. [(11)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27416522/) 9. Drink green tea [Polyphenols are a class of compounds found in green tea](https://www.emedihealth.com/nutrition/health-benefits-green-tea), and they play a role in the induction of a class of immune cells, the T regulatory cells, which maintain immune tolerance and suppress autoimmunity. [(12)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21621552) 10. Consume probiotic yogurt An improvement in immune function was demonstrated when a combination of nutrients and yogurt was used on animals subjected to strenuous exercise. [(13)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096399691300330X) 11. Increase your vitamin D intake [Vitamin D can modulate the immune response](https://www.emedihealth.com/nutrition/vitamin-d), and a [deficiency of vitamin D is associated with autoimmunity](https://www.emedihealth.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-deficiency) and decreased resistance to diseases. [(14)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166406/) 12. Take ashwagandha (Indian ginseng) Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) has been used traditionally in Indian medicine for the treatment of a variety of ailments due to its immunomodulatory effects. A study conducted in 2021 has demonstrated for the first time that the leaf and root extract of ashwagandha possesses potent immune-stimulatory properties. It enhanced the activity of Th2 (T helper cell subset 2), a type of immune cell, enhanced the secretion of a chemical modulator IL4 (interleukin 4), and enhanced the expression of Th1 (T helper cell subset 1). [(15)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252722) These results demonstrated that [ashwagandha can be used as an addition to immunity-boosting herbal supplements](https://www.emedihealth.com/nutrition/ashwagandha-health-benefits). 13. Exercise regularly Physical activity can lead to a healthy life. It helps maintain ideal body weight, prevent inflammation, prevent metabolic disorders such as diabetes, and even boost immunity to prevent common transmittable diseases such as viral infections. Physical exercise, both regular and occasional, can significantly alter the body's immunity. The degree of benefit depends on the intensity and frequency of physical exercise. Moderate-intensity exercise can help increase cellular immunity, which helps fight against pathogens. [(16)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7387807/) 14. Get adequate sleep Not getting sufficient sleep for long periods or every day can activate your body's stress response. This can decrease your immunity and make you prone to diseases. [(17)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256323/) Normal adults need at least 7 hours of sleep per day to maintain their health. Most-Asked Questions About Strengthening Immunity What foods should I eat to maintain a healthy immune system? A [balanced diet helps in maintaining a healthy immune system](https://www.emedihealth.com/nutrition/foods-boost-immune-system). Fiber-rich foods such as whole grains and legumes, colored fruits and vegetables that are rich in antioxidants and minerals, and foods rich in healthy fats such as avocado and olive oil are recommended to maintain a robust immune system. What foods should I avoid? Avoid foods such as processed meat and refined carbohydrates such as bread, pizza, and pasta. Avoid junk foods and foods containing added sugar. What is immunity? The immune system is an organ system in the body that helps protect it. It distinguishes between self (the body cells) and nonself molecules (invaders or pathogens) and prevents infections, diseases, etc. It classifies the molecules it recognizes as antigens. Immunity is regulated by many factors: the physical barrier being the first one. The body's physical barrier consists of the skin, cornea, mucous lining of the gastrointestinal tract, genital and urinary tract, etc. [(18)](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/biology-of-the-immune-system/overview-of-the-immune-system) What causes immunodeficiency? Certain diseases and deficiencies can cause immunodeficiencies. These include: - Metabolic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension - Cancer - Nutrient deficiencies (iron, protein, etc.) - AIDS (an immune disorder caused by HIV infection) [(19)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK500027/) How do I know if I have immunodeficiency? Are there cardinal (essential) symptoms? Immunodeficiency can cause respiratory tract infections such as bronchitis and sinusitis or gastrointestinal infections. Sometimes, it can cause more severe infections such as sepsis. Immunodeficiency can also be suspected in children or infants with chronic diarrhea, lethargy, unusual infections (e.g., adenovirus), chronic encephalitis, seizures, skin lesions, warts, etc. Herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, etc., are also uncommon infections in children that may indicate immunodeficiency. Patients with autoimmune diseases such as hemolytic anemia are also at risk of immunodeficiency. What tests are done to detect immunodeficiency? The patient is tested for secondary conditions that may be causing immunodeficiency such as diabetes and AIDS. These tests include: - Complete blood picture (CBP) - Antibody tests - Hypersensitivity tests - Fasting blood sugar - Stool tests Final Word The use of any of the above-mentioned foods/herbs along with good lifestyle practices could go a long way in helping your body combat disease and improve your health.
