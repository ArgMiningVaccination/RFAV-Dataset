However, if you're looking for something more natural, consider using supplements and herbs for diarrhea, constipation, and other digestive ailments. For instance, some herbs and supplements may be able to help you get irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) under control. The benefits of choosing natural remedies include possibly fewer side effects than medication and less reason for concern about long-term use. That said, there is less rigorous researched-backed evidence for herbs and supplements. This article explains common natural ingredients that are used to ease diarrhea, constipation, and other digestive health issues. Before trying any herbal supplement, speak with your healthcare provider to ensure that it will not interact with any medications you are taking or cause problems due to an underlying medical condition, including kidney or liver disease. Supplements and Herbs for Diarrhea Diarrhea can be caused by a variety of issues. Depending on the underlying reason for diarrhea, different natural treatments might be helpful. Fighting Infection One of the most common causes of diarrhea is an infection that is either viral, bacterial, or parasitic. While there are herbal remedies that can help cure the infection, certain infections can be made worse by supplements and herbal treatments. Thus, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider and understand what type of infection you might have. You can discuss the following treatments which have some evidence of being effective: Bovine Colostrum Bovine colostrum is the milk produced by a cow during the first few days after giving birth. It has been used as a supplement mostly for babies. The colostrum contains antibodies, growth factors, and cytokines. Some studies also show it can help treat diarrhea in adults. However, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness. Berberine This medicinal plant is used in traditional medicine for a range of conditions, including diarrhea, because it has antimicrobial properties to fight bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It's found in common supplements such as goldenseal, Oregon grape, and barberry. However, if you take these supplements orally, you may not be able to absorb enough berberine to gain digestive benefits. Zinc While high levels of zinc can cause diarrhea, trials also show that lower levels of zinc supplements can reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea in children. To understand and confirm these findings, larger studies need to be performed. Reducing Inflammation Inflammation of the colon can lead to chronic diarrhea. For these conditions, consider the following natural treatments. Chamomile Chamomile, available in tea, liquid, or capsule form, is thought to reduce inflammation and quiet spasms in the gut. Chamomile is not appropriate for anyone following a low-FODMAP diet. Berry Leaf Teas Berry leaf teas include beverages made from blueberry, blackberry, or raspberry leaves. These contain tannins which may decrease inflammation and the secretion of fluids in the intestines. Lactobacillus Acidophilus Some evidence shows that the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) can ease diarrhea because it promotes \"good\" bacteria in your digestive system. However, the research is mixed. You can try eating yogurt containing the probiotic, but if your immune system is compromised, discuss this with your healthcare provider first. Ginger Diarrhea associated with IBS may be eased with ginger and ginger extract. The research is mostly based on animal studies, so more investigation is required to better understand how effective ginger may be. Quercetin Quercetin has been shown to alleviate diarrhea. Taken as an oral supplement, quercetin seems to have antioxidant capability that improves gut bacteria and metabolic function. Supplements and Herbs for Constipation Some supplements and herbal preparations are considered effective in treating constipation because they have a laxative effect. Anthraquinone Substances called anthraquinones are organic compounds found in some plants. In addition to having medicinal qualities, anthraquinones are used for dyes. Anthraquinones are powerful laxatives. If used inappropriately, they can irritate the gastrointestinal tract. However, research has shown that they can be effective at easing constipation when used correctly. Sources of anthraquinone that can be used to treat constipation include: Senna tea: Made from the leaves of a senna plant, it's used in traditional medicine and is sometimes used to clean the colon before a colonoscopy. Cascara sagrada: This was used to treat constipation for years as a laxative, but the FDA withdrew its approval as an OTC medication due to safety concerns. However, it's still found in unregulated herbal supplements. Rhubarb: This vegetable is used in Eastern medicine for its laxative effects and is sometimes incorporated into a tea to assist with bowel movements; however, there have not been clinical trials performed to confirm these claims. Frangula: Frangula bark preparations have been used for centuries to ease constipation. However, due to the possibility of toxicity, there are warnings against using it as a supplement. Anthraquinone herbal laxatives should not be used for more than seven days as their extended use may increase the risk of liver toxicity and damage. Cascara sagrada being removed from OTC laxatives https://www.verywellhealth.com/cascara-sagrada-89046 Psyllium Psyllium is a bulk-forming laxative. Derived from the husks of the psyllium seed, it's a type of soluble fiber. In powder products like Metamucil, psyllium is mixed with water and taken by mouth to treat occasional constipation and maintain regular bowel movements. Amalaka Amalaki powder, made from the fruit of the Amalaki tree, is found throughout Asia and is used often in Ayurvedic medicine. It is thought to positively affect overall digestion and some research has shown that it can ease constipation. Triphala Triphala is an herbal preparation made from the fruit of the bibhataki, haritaki, and Amalaki trees. In addition to its laxative effect, Triphala is thought to reduce abdominal pain and bloating. Herbs for Digestive Health In addition to specifically helping with bowel movements, some herbs can be used to improve overall digestive health. Peppermint Oil Peppermint oil is the only herbal supplement to get the seal of approval from the American College of Gastroenterology due to its effectiveness in reducing abdominal pain. This pain-relieving quality is thought to be the result of peppermint oil's effect on gut motility. Peppermint oil appears to relax the muscles of the gut. This can reduce the muscle spasms that contribute to abdominal pain. Slippery Elm Slippery elm has a long history of use by Native Americans as a remedy for a variety of health conditions. In terms of digestive health, slippery elm is thought to calm irritation by coating the lining of the intestinal system. Slippery elm's effect on the stool illustrates why it is seen as helpful. By adding bulk to the stool, it is thought to ease diarrhea. Slippery elm also softens the stool, thus helping ease constipation. Artichoke Leaf Extract A newer natural remedy to the IBS treatment list, artichoke leaf extract (ALE) shows some surprising promise. In a 2016 meta-analysis, various studies indicate that it is effective in reducing bowel movements from regular constipation and diarrhea down to \"normal.\" This is believed to be due to a certain antispasmodic compound called cynaropicrin. Aloe Vera Aloe vera juice is often marketed as a remedy for IBS. However, the limited research that exists on the subject is contradictory. Some studies have shown it to have no effects on IBS symptoms. At least one double-blind randomized clinical trial trial found it to be effective in relieving constipation, but not abdominal pain. There is still much debate and more research is needed. Aloe vera can cause a drop in blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and needs to be used with caution in people on diabetes medications. Homeopathic Remedies for Diarrhea Summary Changes in your diet are an important part of managing diarrhea, constipation, and digestive problems. You can also take OTC or prescription medication to ease symptoms. However, using supplements and herbal remedies is an option to manage your symptoms\u2014or even prevent chronic issues. Choose supplements such as goldenseal to fight infections in the digestive tract and chamomile to reduce inflammation since these conditions can cause diarrhea. You can also elieve constipation with anthraquinones, fiber, and other natural substances. For other digestive problems, consider using essential oils, extracts, and aloe vera. Talk with your healthcare provider before you begin any treatments with supplements or herbal therapies. 18 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
