Essential oils are becoming a staple in many American households. Many essential oils can support your weight loss efforts. Although they don't directly burn calories for you, essential oils can add some complementary benefits to your day. They can be effective tools for detoxifying, reducing appetite, and preventing sugar cravings. The oils can: - Boost the metabolism - Help drain fluid retention - Nip feelings of \"the munchies\" - Improve digestion - Energize your workout [Uplift your spirits](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/energizing-essential-oils/) - Relieve tension and stress - Ease aches and pains in the body - Correct [stretch marks](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/essential-oils-for-stretch-marks/)or cellulite Weight loss is almost always combined with healthy lifestyle choices, possible changes in diet, and changes in emotional eating behavior. The idea of supporting yourself with essential oils is that if you're feeling mentally and physically well, you're more likely to stick to your plan of losing weight. Top 5 Best Essential Oils for Weight Loss 1. Grapefruit The first thing you want to do when thinking about shedding a pound or two is making sure that you have a well-firing metabolism. Grapefruit essential oil (Citrus x paradisi) does just that! It is a tangy yet sweet citrus oil that carries a bright scent and uplifting energy. Grapefruit oil can increase your body's metabolism, which in turns helps melt fat away. Whether you're on a toning program, or a full-on weight reduction program, grapefruit essential oil should be the first oil you reach for. Not only does Grapefruit boost the metabolism, it also aids in promoting mental balance and [encouraging a joyful mood](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/energizing-essential-oils/). Both are feelings that I'm certain you'd like to have while working towards reducing body weight. 2. Fennel Sweet Fennel essential oil (Foeniculum vulgare var. dulce) is a diuretic, meaning it causes increased passing of urine. With that, it is detoxifying and aids with fluid retention, heavy legs, cellulite, flatulence and constipation. It promotes overall increased digestive well-being. Fennel has a slight scent of licorice. If you don't like licorice, use it sparingly or blend it well with other oils. This allows you to still get the benefits without too much of the aroma. NOTE: Avoid Fennel essential oil during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. 3. Juniper Berry Juniper Berry (Juniperus communis) is an incredible natural purifier. In aromatherapy, its properties are known as depurative, meaning it's an herb considered to have purifying and detoxifying effects. Detoxifying helps with fluid retention, abdominal bloating and cellulite. Not only that, Juniper Berry is also also nervine, meaning it is used to calm the nerves. Therefore it [relieves mental tension and anxiety](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/essential-oils-help-stress-anxiety/), which contributes to a healthy approach to weight loss. Its sweet and grassy scent blends amazingly well with the citrus notes of grapefruit oil. I always mix Juniper Berry in with my weight loss essential oils blend. Just a few drops are enough! NOTE: Avoid Juniper Berry during pregnancy, and if you have kidney disorders. 4. Lemon If you're looking for an essential oil weight loss powerhouse, look to Lemon essential oil (Citrus limon). It is actually one of those oils that you shouldn't try to stock for too long in your oils cabinet, so use it liberally! Lemon is part of the citrus group of oils, all of which are top notes, meaning they evaporate quicker than [middle or base notes](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/blending-essential-oils/). Every time the bottle of essential oil is opened, more air comes into contact with the oil, altering its components and affecting its shelf life. Lemon essential oil further supports your weight loss goals by being uplifting to the mood, energizing to the body, and stopping food cravings or \"the munchies\" with its zesty aroma. There may be underlying emotional issues that have caused weight gain, so approaching each day with a happy mood will certainly help your weight loss program. NOTE: Lemon oil may cause irritation on highly sensitive skin; it's recommended you first do a skin patch test before adding it into your weight loss blend. 5. Ginger Ginger essential oil (Zingiber officinale), also known as Ginger Root, is a natural appetite suppressant. It helps you curb sugar cravings and reduce feelings of the \"munchies\". Reduced food consumption is one of the best ways to promote weight loss. Ginger oil also fortifies and stimulates digestion, which helps in the absorption of vitamins and minerals contained in the foods you do eat. Sometimes, unwanted weight gain is a result of a digestion that isn't functioning optimally. Ginger has a warm, spicy, woody yet still lightly lemon-y scent. It blends amazingly well together with Lemon. Bonus: Fit Essential Oil Blend Another wonderful option for weight management is the \"Fit\" essential oil blend from [Simply Earth](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/simply-earth-review/). It is specifically formulated to help you resist snacking between meals. The scent is refreshing and uplifting at the same time. Fit blend gives you a boost of positivity and helps you make healthier choices rather than reaching for that afternoon snack for a pick me up. Less snacking not only helps you lose weight, it also prevents weight gain. Weight Loss Essential Oil Blend Recipe Our bodies are extremely intricate, and often left in chaos when not getting the care they need. One of the easiest ways to support your body and enjoy the benefits of essential oils is through massage. These topical aromatherapy treatments may help reduce body fat and improve overall feelings of well-being. Ingredients - 2 oz (60 ml) of carrier oil such as Jojoba or Sweet Almond oil - 12 drops Grapefruit essential oil - 8 drops Lemon essential oil - 8 drops Fennel essential oil - 4 drop Ginger essential oil - 4 drop Juniper berry essential oil This is a total of 36 drops of essential oils, which equals a [dilution rate](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/essential-oil-dilution-guide/) of 2% in the carrier oil. A rate of 2% is regarded as safe for the general adult population. If you are elderly, you'll want to stay closer to a 1% dilution rate, which would be 18 drops total, in the 2 oz (60 ml) of [carrier oil](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/essential-oil-carrier-oil/). Directions Get a [2 oz empty amber glass bottle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y61Y2PD/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=eoh-diy-tips-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06Y61Y2PD&linkId=949fa1c7de0e23b847de7fa5277e6e75), blend the recipe together, and rub the oils into your tummy 2-3 times daily. I recommend to not only use a single oil, but use 3-5 oils in a blend as I have done above. This follows the principle of \"the sum is greater than its parts\". Essential oils complement each other and have benefit-stacking effects when added together. [Blending the right set of essential oils](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/blending-essential-oils/), for the right person, is at the heart of the practice of holistic aromatherapy. Substitutions If you don't have all of these oils at home, you may substitute. For grapefruit: substitute with fennel, juniper berry, or black pepper. If you don't have lemon: use lemongrass, citronella, bergamot essential oil, lemon verbena, or Melissa. Should ginger be missing: use peppermint essential oil, chamomile, spearmint, or mandarin. Fennel and juniper berry substitute each other, so you will need one of the two for an effective weight loss blend. If you happen to not like the scent of your essential oil blend, add a drop or two of lavender essential oil, purely for aromatic reasons.
