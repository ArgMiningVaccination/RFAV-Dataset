However, there are many ailments that remain uncured with allopath and people look for alternate systems of medicine, to get relief from their pain and sufferings. Two of the prominent alternative systems of medicine are homeopath and naturopath that are confusing for many people as they think of these systems as same or at least similar. However, reality is somewhat different, and this article attempts to highlight the differences between naturopath and homeopath. Naturopath Nature is the biggest healing force is the idea behind naturopath, which is an alternate system of medicine and includes all therapies that make use of naturally available products and the immune powers of the human body to find a cure for all ailments afflicting human beings. Following natural principles of life and remaining closest to nature is the basic philosophy of this system of treatment.

Maintaining harmony with nature and using the healing powers of nature to restore health back to an ailing person is the basic aim of naturopath. In today's world, when man is getting away from nature and exercises living a sedentary lifestyle full of lots of stress coupled with poor dietary intake, it is only natural for him to be suffering from various lifestyle diseases. Naturopathy tries to restore health by making the diet balanced and asking the patient take some rest and do some exercises. At present, naturopathy is a full time course granting a medical degree to the person who passes the course and becomes eligible to treat patients using natural therapies and medicines made of natural products. Homoeopath Samuel Hahnemann is credited to be the father of this system of medicine that was developed in 18th century. He found that some substances that could induce symptoms in a healthy person could treat another one who was sick. He also found that it was possible to make doses of different concentrations by changing the potency or the power of the substance. Today, homeopath is a very popular medicine system after allopath in all parts of the world. Homoeopathic medicines are produced from natural sources such as plants, animals, and minerals found in nature. However, it remains a system of medicines where medicines are prepared in a special manner and administered in different potencies based upon the severity of symptoms. Being natural it can be considered to be a part of naturopathy. The medicines are safe and can be given to small children and pregnant women too. | | What is the difference between Naturopath and Homeopath? While both naturopath and homoeopath are holistic in nature, homoeopathy is developed as a special and distinct medicine system, and naturopath considers homeopath as its part. Naturopath deals with diet and lifestyle as naturopath believes the ailment to be a result of going away from nature. On the other hand, there is no such premise for a homeopath. When a naturopath has to give medicines for the treatment of an ailment, he uses herbs or homeopath medicines While naturopath believes in massage as therapy and also lays stress on including certain foods in the diet as part of treatment, homoeopath makes no such condition.
