In line with this requirement and in its quest to achieve an ef cient and effective regulatory system whilst ensuring customer satisfaction, the National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) began its efforts to obtain ISO 9002:1994 certi cation of its management system in 1998. Bene ts Derived Under the ISO certi cation scheme, an organisation needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide a service that is in line with regulatory requirements that meets customer satisfaction through the effective application of an ef cient quality management system. The organisation should also be able to assure conformity to set standards and that systems are in place for continual improvement. .

All centres/ sections/ units in NPCB are included in this certi cation process. They are: a) Centre for Product Registration b) Centre for Post Registration c) Centre for Quality Control d) Centre for Organisational Development e) Centre for Good Manufacturing Practice f) Administration Unit Milestones in the Achievement of MS ISO 9000 by NPCB Following the ful llment of ISO documentation requirements, an Adequacy Audit was conducted on 16 January 2001 by SIRIM QAS. This was followed by a Compliance Audit which was carried out on 18-19 April 2001 during which ve (5) non-conformances (NCR) and three (3) observations (now termed as Opportunities for Improvement or OFI) were identi ed. However, as there was overall compliance to the requirements of the ISO standards, NPCB was granted MS ISO 9002:1994 Certi cation on 17 July 2001. 3UBAT-UBATANBerita NEWSLETTER OF THE DRUG CONTROL AUTHORITY MALAYSIA The following year i.e 2002, a Surveillance Audit was done and as a result of which NPCB obtained 1 NCR and 3 OFI reports. Prior to the 2003 Surveillance Audit by SIRIM QAS, NPCB converted its quality management system from the ISO 9002:1994 to be in line with the new clauses as stipulated in the new MS ISO 9001:2000 standard. During the audit which was conducted on 11-13 August 2003, NPCB successfully upgraded its certi cation status to MS ISO 9001:2000 and obtained a total 4 NCR and 4 OFI reports. During the Reassessment Audit in 2004, NPCB widened the certi cation scope to include the regulation of cosmetic products which was previously not included as cosmetics regulation had not yet started. NPCB was very happy with its achievements whereby there were no non-conformances reported but 12 OFI were identi ed. NPCB further improved its performance in 2005 as during this Surveillance Audit, there were again no non-conformances reported but 5 OFI were identi ed. In 2006, NPCB converted to an on-line electronic Document Control system which was developed in- house by NPCB's own staff. There was full commitment by the management and all the staff towards maintaining the standard achieved during the 2005 audit. Indeed, it was a memorable moment for the entire NPCB workforce when the audit nding showed only one (1) OFI and no non-conformances at all. NPCB is committed towards ensuring the quality, ef cacy and safety of products which it regulates and to achieve customer satisfaction through reducing bureaucracy without compromising on statutory and administrative requirements. NPCB has strived to continually improve the services that it provides its clients by having a competent and knowledgeable workforce who are professional and open minded as well as through dialogues with its stakeholders who have provided valuable feedback and constructive criticisms. Future Plans In its efforts for continual improvement, NPCB is now embarking on a journey towards achieving MS ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation for the testing of traditional medicines.4Berita NEWSLETTER OF THE DRUG CONTROL AUTHORITY MALAYSIAUBAT-UBATANBerita NEWSLETTER OF THE DRUG CONTROL AUTHORITY MALAYSIA The 5th ACCSQ Traditional Medicines & Health Supplements Product Working Group (TMHS PWG) Meeting 27 to 28 July 2006, SingaporeNEWS UPDATE ON ASEAN TRADITIONAL MEDICINES AND HEALTH SUPPLEMENT HARMONISATION The Fifth Meeting Of The ASEAN Consultative Committee for Standards and Quality (ACCSQ) Traditional Medicines and Health Supplements Product Working Group (TMHS PWG) The 5th Meeting of the ASEAN Consultative Committee for Standards and Quality (ACCSQ) Traditional Medicines and Health Supplements Product Working Group (TMHS PWG) was held on 27-28 July 2006 in Singapore.

However non-oral products containing Arginine are exempted from the ruling as the usage is for therapeutic purpose and the administration is under the supervision of a medical doctor.WARNING STATEMENT ON THE LABEL AND PACKAGE INSERT OF ORAL HEALTH SUPPLEMENTS CONTAINING ARGININE CONCERNED WITH \"ARGININE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PATIENT FOLLOWING A HEART ATTACK\" 9UBAT-UBATANBerita NEWSLETTER OF THE DRUG CONTROL AUTHORITY MALAYSIA WARNING STATEMENT ON LABEL AND PACKAGE INSERT OF TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS CONTAINING BLACK COHOSH (CIMICIFUGAE RACEMOSAE) CONCERNED WITH \"SERIOUS HEPATIC REACTION\" The implementation of the security labelling using Meditag TM has been enforced by the DCA and effective from 2005. The Meditag TM contains security features and serial numbers to authenticate DCA registered products in the market, thus allowing different levels of authenti cation for consumers to recognise as well as enforcement teams to verify, track and trace registered products in the market. After more than one year of their use and in accordance to the contractual terms the suppliers for Meditag TM label has introduced some upgraded features not only to enhance the security but also to further facilitate the enforcement of cers in their enforcement work. The old version is still usable, while the new ones are estimated to be available for distribution in September 2006.MEDITAGTM - UPGRADING OF SECURITY FEATURESThe DCA at its 183rd meeting held on 27th July 2006 agreed that the warning, 'serious hepatic reaction' is compulsory to be put on the labels and package inserts of traditional/natural products containing Black Cohosh (Cimicifugae Racemosae). The \"Warning\" should also contain the following statement: \u0081 Stop taking this product if signs and symptoms suggestive of liver injury develop such as tiredness, loss of appetite, yellowing of the skin and eyes or severe upper stomach pain with nausea and vomiting or dark urine and consult your doctor immediately. \u0081 Patients using herbal medicinal products should tell their doctor about it. 10UBAT-UBATANBerita NEWSLETTER OF THE DRUG CONTROL AUTHORITY MALAYSIA On the 15th of September 2006, information was received regarding nine (9) cosmetic products under the brand name SK-II which were tested in China and found to contain Chromium and Neodymium which are listed as prohibited substances in cosmetics. The products which were tested are as follows: 1. SK-II's Whitening Liquid Foundation SK-II's Facial Treatment Mask9. SK-II's Skin Essence Foundation OB-2 In Malaysia, Chromium and Neodymium are also listed as ingredients which are not allowed to be used. The Drug Control Authority (DCA) evaluates all cosmetic products prior to registration and there are no known products which have been registered including the above SK-II products which contain any banned or prohibited substances. However, Chromium and Neodymium have been detected in trace amounts in these products but is probably due to their natural occurrence in some of the ingredients used in their formulation. Taking into account that Chromium and Neodymium are naturally occuring elements, the current guidelines used in the regulation of cosmetic products do make provision for the presence of such substances found in cosmetics.PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT Update on the much publicised news of SK-II products which were tested in China and found to contain prohibited substances.11BeritaUBAT-UBATANBerita NEWSLETTER OF THE DRUG CONTROL AUTHORITY MALAYSIA Chromium may cause skin reactions and Neodymium may irritate the eyes, cause pulmonary embolism or damage the liver. However, at trace levels, they are highly unlikely to give rise to such reactions. To date, there have been no reports of any adverse effects arising from the use of these SK-II products and based on the current situation, the use of these products is still allowed in Malaysia. The following events have been planned by the National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) as part of the continuous training programme for either the staff or the industry: 1. TRAINING COURSE ON QUALITY CONTROL OF TRADITIONAL PRODUCT (MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION TESTING) 18-22 September 2006 2. ISO 17025 LABORATORY INTERNAL AUDITING TRAINING 2-3 November 2006 3.
