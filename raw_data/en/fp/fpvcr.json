Plan to join us now.Stockholm AIDS Conference: The Untold Story by John S. Jam es The IV International Conference on AIDS, June 12-16 in Stockholm, Sweden, included over 3,000 scientific presentations \u2014 more than twice as many as last year's meeting in Washington, DC. ItitSentinel covered these conferences to gather information on promising treatment possibilities and related scientific research. This article gives an overview; details will follow in the next several installments of On Guard, starting in the July 1 Sentinel and continuing every other issue. The Good News Despite largely pessimistic press reports, we found more good news than bad from the Stockholm conference: Tremendous nuts-and-bolts prog\u00ad ress in basic research represents major advances toward an eventual cure or highly effective treatment for AIDS and many other diseases as well. Little of this progress makes headlines, however. The conference reflerted a new stage of effective worldwide mobiliza\u00ad tion in many areas of AIDS. (Unfor\u00ad tunately, there are also glaring deficien\u00ad cies, illustrated below.) In civil liberties and related areas (outside our treatment focus), the world's experts have developed strong consensus which recognizes the con\u00ad cerns and dignity of persons with AIDS. For example, balancing the rights of in\u00ad fected persons against those of the uninfected is seen as a false issue; on the contrary, antidiscrimination protection is regarded as absolutely crucial to ef\u00ad fective control of the spread of the virus. Far from being opposed, the interests of those with AIDS and the larger society correspond. The developing consensus easily crosses national borders. For example, telephone hotlines throughout the world are now providing roughly the same information. Behind the Bad News: Analysis and Comment The bad news is the lack of major treatment advances in the last year. Most commentators have assumed that lack of progress on treatments reflects the difficulty of the disease. But analysis of the Stockholm presentations contradicts this assumption. The evidence suggests another cause for lack of treatments. If the intractability of the disease were responsible, we would have ex\u00ad pected to see a string of treatment failures at Stockholm \u2014 many reports of drugs or other therapies which were tried but failed to work. In fact there were very few such reports. Very few new treatments failed in the last year. Very few were tried at all. The problem is political, not technical. The impressive worldwide mobilization around basic research, prevention and other areas has glaring\u00ad ly omitted any serious mobilization or commitment to save the lives of those now infected or ill. These people were written off several years ago, and since then there has been no institutional con\u00ad stituency for mobilizing research to save lives. The major thrust of the scientists at Stockholm has been to find a curethrough elegant molecular biology, maybe in five to ten years. There is no urgency or mobilization to test the dozens if not hundreds of treatment possibilities widely agreed to be available now \u2014 dozens of which could be tested within the next few months if only there were the will. Some of the scientists now realize that current policies all but guarantee that hundreds of thousands of people will die of AIDS during the next fewproved scientific tests. The research ' community involved in this effort has never had it so good. No one is deliberately conspiring to keep AIDS going to feed the multi\u00ad billion dollar research and phar\u00ad maceutical industries. No one has need\u00ad ed to. For the interests of the powerful are only threatened by doing what needs to be done \u2014 creating a mechanism to promptly test the dozens of promising treatments already known and available, regardless of commercial prospects \u2014 each with perhaps 10 to 20 volunteers. The problem isn't money \u2014 this testing wouldn' t need to cost much \u2014 but pervasive obstructionism throughout the institutions involved. This problem may seem so big as to be hopeless. But there is a key place to start, namely where public effort can have critical results: the lobbying of The symbol for the Intematioiiil AIDS Coafertnee in Stockholm featured a heteroKxual nodear fam Oy, an image some gay participants said reflected insensitivity by conference organizen. years. Some have reached the \" isn't it a pity'' stage. But few have broken through the aura of inevitability to see the problem as resulting from human attitudes and decisions which can and should be changed. The one common factor behind vir\u00ad tually every treatment attempt receiving serious research attention \u2014 AZT, vac\u00ad cines, interferons, CD4, Ampligen, IMREG-I and a few others \u2014 is hot prospects for commercial gain. No ma\u00ad jor institution, government or private, will seriously consider a treatment sole\u00ad ly on its medical and scientific (as op\u00ad posed to commercial) merit. If it's aAIDS, gay and physicians' organiza\u00ad tions to investigate and address the issues of clinical trials and treatment ac\u00ad cess for saving the lives of the millions of people already infected with the AIDS virus. The decision to write off those already ill probably started from homophobia. But now it continues on its own momentum, due to the almost total lack of institutional support to change it. We saw this lack in Stockholm, when scientists didn't even feel the need to address the issue of the \" drugjam'' in clinical trials. Like the first candle in a dark room. The one common factor behind virtually every treatment attempt is hot prospects for commercial gain. plant that anyone could pick, a food in general use, a common industrial chemical or a health-food product, it won't be considered, no matter what the evidence. Scientists as well as corporations have vested interests. It has unfor\u00ad tunately always been hard to find finan\u00ad cial support for basic biological and modkal research \u2014 work which doesn't make headlines, but on which future progress depends. AIDS is now driving huge advances in fundamental knowl\u00ad edge of viruses and the immune system, as well as related technology such as im-scientific merit. No one could cover all 3,000 presentations in the few days of the con\u00ad ference; scientists naturally focused on what was hot in their fields. Sentinel coverage emphasizes those treatments most likely to be overlooked; we spent our time gathering as much information as possible on leads concerning these treatments. We may have been the only journalist at the conference whose primary business was to seek out precisely those treatments most likely to be overlooked for no good reason. Treatment possibilities not at the conference which we would like to have been there included BHT, DHEA, DNCB, garlic and MMl. Apparently nobody submitted papers on these. Treatments or leads presented in Stockholm which we plan to cover in\u00ad clude tumor necrosis factor and zinc. We will also look at new research directions and improved methods such as new scientific tests. A copy o f the abstracts of all 3,000 presentations at the Stockholm con\u00ad ference is available at the library o f the Healing Alternatives Foundation (formerly the Healing Alternatives Buyers' Club), 273 Church Street, San Francisco, open Tuesday through Saturday, 1-5 pm, (415) 626-2316. There is a keyword subject index and an author index, so you can find the abstracts on the above treatments or on other subjects. Individual abstracts can be photocopied at the library for five cents each. FDA Clamps Down on Alternative Clinics by David Nahmod \" It is my opinion that the United States government is partaking in* the purposeful genocide of gays, blacks, IV-drug users and others they perceive as undesirable,\" says Tom O 'Connor, a co-founder of the Healing Alternative Foundation, formerly known as the Healing Alternative Buyers' Club. What has moved O'Connor to make this statement are recent actions harassing AIDS alternative therapy clinics on both coasts and cutting offsupplies to some of the clinics of cer\u00ad tain alternative treatments which users say are effective in many cases.

Treatments at Stockholm Dozens of treatment possibilities ap\u00ad peared among the 3,000 presentations at Stockholm. Most were largely ig\u00ad nored, however, with their poster ses\u00ad sions usually empty; the scientists just walked by.

'V^>Hirry Britt gears up for his third race around the electoral track in the upcoming race for supervisor. Britt Readies for Third-Term Race by Alex MacDonald Supervisor Harry Britt will officially kick off his reelection cam\u00ad paign next week. Seeking his third full term on the Board of Super\u00ad visors, Britt was confident that he would retain his seat. He con\u00ad ceded, however, that emotions generated by the Olympics issue will prevent him from leading the pack of candidates and thus winning the presidency of the Board of Supervisors. Noting that the vote two weeks ago in favor of Proposition M revealed some polarization in San Francisco around gay men and lesbians, Britt said that his showing in November \"will show a lot about where we stand.\" Prop. M mandated an uncon-Jesse Jackson showed the way on the Missouri when he said that blacks have a choice between voting to spend on Pentagon waste or on social pro\u00ad grams that benefit blacks. \"There is no reason,\" Britt says, \"why black peo\u00ad ple should support the Pentagon.\" In addition to the Missouri 's pro\u00ad viding a rallying point for the city's pro\u00ad gressive constituencies in the coming elertion, there will probably also be a large number of progressive candidates to choose from. Pat Norman is widely assumed to be running a third time. College board member Julie Tang has kept her options open. Terrence Hallinan, whom Britt defeated in his first run for the board, is already run\u00ad ning a vigorous campaign and has broad name recognition throughoutSan Francisco. Britt takes them all in stride. \"The more, the merrier,\" he laughed when the list was read off to him. \" 1 benefit from a large field.\" Dick Pabich, one of Britt's several campaign consultants, is more guard\u00ad ed. \"The M is s o u r i he says, \"could be big and divisive. But it' s a presiden\u00ad tial year, so there will be a massive turnout. And people sense that it will be possible to get things done on issues like vacancy control and domestic partners now that Feinstein's gone. Even in things like 'Save the Library,' Harry now plays a bigger role.\" Pabich, an experienced San Fran\u00ad cisco election analyst, does not expect Britt to run a high<ost campaign. \"There's no point in it. Harry has a solid constituency, but to come in first.he'd need to do well in all parts of the city. In some areas there' s a lot of feel\u00ad ing against him. The community has too many other needs right now to make (the board presidency) a priori\u00ad ty.\" Carole Migden, who will handle fundraising for Britt, estimates that the campaign will need about $200,000, a low budget for a winning supervisorial race. Britt and his advise\u00ab^ will rely heavily on a large volunteer army similar to the corps that Art Agnos put into the field in his campaign against John Molinari last fall. Migden looks forward to a \"strong, visible campaign with a lot of high spirits, fun and en\u00ad thusiasm.\" Everybody Loves a Gay Day Parade tion of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation. A coalition similar to the one behind Prop. M now supports a ballot mea\u00ad sure calling for the homcporting of the Missouri at Hunters Point.

Many in the gay community fear that Prop. M shows San Francisco turning away from its still young tradi-orientation \u2014 this time by the Navy \u2014 puts the gay community and its friends and allies in the forefront of opposition to the measure. Britt, however, feels that the homeporting may actually help his candidacy. \"The Missouri \" he said, \"brings together a lot of dif\u00ad ferent groups.\" On a more general level, Britt feels.San Francisco's largest tourist event, the Lesbian and Gay Freedom Day Parade kicks off this year from the Castro at II am, Sunday, June 26. The perennial Dykes on Bikes once again lead an array of more than 200 contingents and more than 50 floats. Special effects are scattered throughout the extravaganza. At Civic Center, two speakcr/performance plat\u00ad forms and a disco stage offer sufficient stimulus to keep everyone's attention. For a complete listing of the parties and special events, see W eek at a Glance, pages 40-41. FDA Contlnu 0d from page 3 number of these treatments are also less toxic, and less costly, than AZT. Last week, according to Terry Beswick, the new director of the Heal\u00ad ing Alternative Foundation, the New Jersey warehouses of the Ethigen Cor\u00ad poration were seized by New Jersey health officials, acting under FDA orders. Ethigen is the only company in the country that is licensed to produce AL 721, one of the more effective an\u00ad tiviral alternative treatments. On June 21, 1988, Dr. Stephen Levine of the Allergy Research Group in San Leandro received a letter from the FDA ordering him to stop selling egg lipids as well as germanium, a known immune booster, among other products. The doctor has said that he will continue supplying alternative clinics for as long as he can. Beswick also claims that the founda\u00ad tion's own supplier of germanium, the Global Research Company of South\u00ad ern California, was ordered to cease and desist supplying them with ger\u00ad manium, althou^ they may continue selling the product to health food stores. \"It should be noted,\" says Beswick, \"that health food outlets sell these pro\u00ad ducts at a much higher price than we do. We are a nonprofit organization, and what little profits we do make go directly into our AIDS treatment library. \"AL 721 egg lipids can also be pur\u00ad chased at health food stores,\" Beswickcontinues, \"but their chemical make\u00ad up may not be as accurate, and there\u00ad by less effective, than what we offer. We are constantly testing our product to see how it works best. The FDA does not do this.\" For the past few days, the founda\u00ad tion office at 273 Church Street in San Francisco has been harassed by FDA officials. Clients were stared at and photographed. Under pressure, the foundation has stopped selling dextran sulfate, a product which is legal in Japan. \"We will continue supplying dex\u00adtran sulfate under the counter,\" says Beswick. \"Why shouldn't people be able to get a proven effective treat\u00ad ment?\" Beswick believes that orders for these actions are coming directly from Washington, DC, but no one seems to be sure exactly who is issuing these orders. Brad Stone, the FDA's spokesper\u00ad son in Rockville, Maryland, denies any knowledge of these events. \"The FDA has no problem with people selling AL 721, germanium or dextran sulfate as nutritional supplements,\" he says.\"But once you make a medical claim for a product, that makes the product a drug and subject to the drug ap\u00ad proval process.\" \" But the FDA is not testing drugs on the basis of ethics and safety,\" says Terry Beswick. \"They are not allowing effective treatments to be approved for individuals on an informed consent basis. The burden of proof of a drug' s effectiveness should lie vrith the FDA.\" On Monday, June 27, 1988, a peaceful, organized protest is scheduled at the old Federal Building in Civic Center, next to the ARC/AIDS vigil.The rally will begin at 8:30 am. At 9 am there will be an attempted meeting with George Miller, the director of the city's Health and Human Services Department. The AIDS Action Pledge will have a booth after Sunday's Lesbian/Gay Freedom Day Parade where more in\u00ad formation can be obtained. The Ac\u00ad tion Pledge will be in Washington, DC, on October II for a showdown with the FDA.

This weekend Migden and the rest of the National i Democratic Platform Committee meet in Denver to finalize a draft of that document, which will then go to the na\u00ad tional convention in July. Migden's chief concern is to push for a strategic statement regarding AIDS funding and treatment. \"Without being wordy or cumbersome, I would like a statement included that is specific, strong and forthright,\" said Migden. \"From my initial inquiries, I don' t an\u00ad ticipate facing grave problems in getting the strong planks that will meet the needs of our community.\" On the other hand, Migden said, it would be \"un\u00ad realistic\" to suppose that the commineeCarole Migden would include something like domestic partners legislation in its platform. \" We won' t accomplish our broadest, most radical policy goals,\" she predicted. Migden is joined on the committee by only one other representative from the gay community, Vermont's Terry Anderson. Also appointed to the Platform Committee was former mayor Dianne Feinstein. Both Migden and Feinstein are seated in the Party inner-circle, compliments of presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, a maneuver that raised a few eyebrows in the Agnos Ad\u00ad ministration. Both Migden and Feinstcin heavily backed John Molinari in the mayor's race last year, and both have been on the outs with the new Qty Hall insiders JDThe Golden Gate Business Association (GGBA) has finally gotten through with a little legalese to Joseph Mazzola, chairman of San Franciscans for Home- potting of the USSMissouri, to stop us\u00ad ing GGBA' s name on the committee's letterhead. After several unanswered phone calls and a letter by GGBA vice- president Robert Barnes, Mazzola's lawyer agreed verbally mand to \"cease and desist...the unauthorized use\" of GGBA' s name as a member of the pro-Missouri Steering Committee, thereby implying the association's support of the homeport- ing effort. Kathleen Schimandle, an attorney for GGBA, said that Mazzola's lawyer, A 1 Brundage, would commit the verbal agreement to writing. She said she was also writing a letter this week to the president of the SF Chamber of Com\u00admerce, John Jacobs, who, according to both Barnes and Brundage, gave the homeporting committee permission to use (XiBA's name on its letterhead. Barnes explained that the newly in\u00ad stalled GGBA leadership is not as chummy with the Chamber of Com\u00ad merce crowd as past GGBA president Rod Palmer was. \"GGBA is an in\u00ad dependent voice,\" said Barnes. \"We're not interested in being the gay face of the Chamber of Commerce, and that's the big difference between the former leadership and this one.\" Barnes said he was \" pissed\" that San Franciscans for Homeporting had used GGBA on its letterhead for a recent $200,000 fund\u00ad raiser mailing. \" I want a personal re\u00ad traction to all the people who received that letter,\" said B ^ e s, adding that he would seek legal remedies if the demand was not met. Film-Friendly SF Watch out, Hollywood! San Francisco is poised to revive its reputation as a filmmaker's paradise. Robert Epstein, Oscar-winning producer of The Times of Harvey Milk, was appointed Thursday to the Mayor's Film Advisory Qyuncil. Agnos is the first mayor in the city's history to appoint a full-time official film coordinator, reflecting his three-year campaign to put San Francisco back in the movies. In a lefter to Epstein, Agnos praised, \"You have demonstrated the talent that comes from our communities and which draws the world's attention for its ex\u00ad cellence as an expression of our spirit.\" Epstein has helped produce The AIDS Show, Word Is Out, and PBS' s \" We the People\" with Peter Jennings. Cur\u00ad rently he is at work on a film about the NAMES Quilt, slated to be on TV through HBO. Stressing that his new post \"was not a political appointment,\" Epstein said that Agnos had seen his documentary on Harvey Milk and that he liked it. Nevertheless, Epstein believes Agnos is \"sensitive\" to the need for \"more gay representation\" on his staff. The pro\u00ad ducer hopes to give the \"vibrant, vital independent film community in San Francisco.. .a higher profile and resources.\" For several years moviemakers have shied away from the city's bureaucratic morass \u2014 getting permits to film on pubUc locations has not been easy \u2014 and San Diego's hills and bays often doubled for its sister city. Agnos aide Larry Bush said that producers haveRob Epstein had to \"wander through a maze to shoot on the streets of San Francisco.\" Now, with a proposal to streamline the permit process before the Board of Supervisors, plans to convert the Mis\u00ad sion Street Armory into the city's first major interior soundstage and an eminently qualified film producer on the mayor's team, San Francisco may once again provide the kind of climate that used to attract Hollywood greats like Hitchcock to film classics like KerT/jo.

The individuals who spoke with u s chronicled their personal histories, their values, their love affairs a n d jobs, their sense o f fa m ily a n d their place in the com m unity. They talked about their emerging gay a n d lesbian identities, with all the feelings o f fe a r a n d p a in and the exhilaration that accom pany the integration o f a g a y identity into the dram a we call everyday life. They talked about lives o f courage. The interviews we publish today in \"Queer Folk\" only scratch the surface o f the diversity o f our com m unity, b u t in that shortcoming we fo u n d the theme fo r an ongoing project. The S e n tin e l w ill continue to seek out people to interview in fu tu re issues, an oral history project that we hope will continue to uncover new facets a n d rich textures that comprise lesbian a n d gay culture. Because the gay a n d lesbian com m unity is so diverse, we are often as alienated fro m one another as we are fro m society a t large. We are separated by gender, race, age a n d class. Too often we d o n 't stop to listen to what we m ight learn fr o m one another, our individual voices are often drowned in the din o f our noisy debates a n d hurried lives. The people depicted in \"Queer Folk\" are presented in their own voices, w ithout interruption or interpretation. A stream o f consciousness results, culling the w isdom o f a people who have som ething im portant \u2014 we believe \u2014 to say to us all. \u2014 T im T a y lo r, N e w s E d ito rWAR REFUGEE B E N T R A N / / 4 / D 5 / 4 c f / v i v f B en T ra n g rew u p in S aigon's C h in a to w n .

There, the effects of the McCarthy era were softened by the live-and-let-live philosophy of the sun worshipers and the influence of \\ocai author Christopher Isherwood, who insisted on being himself and played a central role in the gay men's scene.

T hen the hippies came in, an d th e '60s lasted well into the '70s. So it was enchant\u00ad e d . . . . 1 was very lucky to have ended up there. 1 loved it. 1 loved the beach. So they d id n 't hurt me. 1 always figured the FBI had our nam es anyw ay. But 1 never had an official jo b o f any kind to be threatened. So w hen 1 cam e up here [to San Francisco) and saw I lived in the S anta M onica- Venice area. In that area there w ere a lo t o f m ovie people. It wtis ! a free area, the tow n was not that built up, it was on the edge o f Los A ngeles. No one cared about y o u r sex life as long as you had a i go o d ta n . So it was m uch freer. I w ent to U C LA . I was getting m y teaching credentials. Five men th a t I knew w ho were a year-and- a-h a lf ahead o f me got busted an d lost their teaching jobs.

I taught classes in art and furniture reflnishing and every\u00ad thing 1 could teach , private classes, all m y life. But I never to o k the credential. So 1 was never at a point w here 1 was threatened. I think that I did it on purpose. 1 know full well it just happened by accident.

T he first night 1 w as there 1 saw a father [ shoot u p his 16-year-old son w ith j speed before sending him out to i earn som e m oney to cover the rent. W e were sitting in the sam e booth, an d 1 was appalled. 1 I thought this is really w eird, but 1 | also quickly m ade a lot o f friends in the place. I 1 was thin, young and naive, > and 1 w anted to have sex w ith :and driving out to the w oods that Steve, at 18, was real expert at. 1 cam e out to my m other, who was totally supportive, but I'd approached a very nellie status by this tim e. T hat was a shock to people I'd run into from high school. T hey rem em bered m e as this really serious kid w ho'd been in bands singing things like \" W hy V ietnam ?\" and didn't ap\u00ad preciate the change. 1 was like, \" Hey, fuckers \u2014 \" big city,\" but it was just trading hicks for rednecks. I've been gay forever. 1 could feel it when 1 w as four years old, looking around the m en's dress\u00ad ing room during m y first visit to a public pool, but 1 didn't do m uch ab o u t it then. In high school 1 always had lots o f girlfriends. 1 really liked them , but w hen it cam e tim e to have sex, it was am azing how 1 always felt like they were my sisters. 1 used the excuse that 1 respected them too m uch not to wait until we were m arried. As a result. I'd be thinking about their brothers usually. 1 did n 't have any sex un\u00ad til 1 moved away. T hat was in 1972.1 graduated, got drafted as a conscientious o b je c to r , a n d w as se n t to H ouston to do alternative service as a janitor in th e charity w ard o f a hospital. 1 was finally living on m y ow n, and I was ready to com e out.

T he hustlers were tough and funny, and 1 guess I thought this was \" the gay scene.\" 1 learned to be a big cam py bitch, I becam e the old finger-poppin', ' ' ril-re a d -y o u r-b e a d s -M a ry \" type. 1 w as flattered to be taken for a hustler, but when 1 actually turned a trick, 1 felt cheap. The night this crazed old pim p pulled a gun o n m e, 1 packed m y bags and bolted back to Palestine. 1 got m yself transferred to another conscientious objector jo b for m y last six m onths: w ard attendant at a hospital for the crim inally insane in Russ, T exas, and m oved into a little Divine- style trailer on the outskirts o f tow n \u2014 depressing. So w hen 1 spotted Steve, the nelliest thing I'd ever seen, w orking at this convenience store, 1 befriended him , and soon we had seven or eight queens hanging out at my trailer all the tim e, dishing and ] dimcing to loud disco m usic. O f course, if any o f us found any\u00ad body, w e'd jum p on them like ducks on a june bug. It was liberating to understand w hat h ap p en s in these little tow ns. Straight guys w ould spot a nellie guy and talk ab o u t beating him up, but yet, their own closet m entality w ould drive them to seek him out for sex. So it w ould be w ham -bam , and then they w ould w ant out o f there in a hurry. There was this w hole routine w ith flashing car lightsI'm queer, y'all. D o n 't like it? Well, look at it anyw ay cause 1 am here!\" A nd I still, from hav\u00ad ing been a very political person, could alw ays drop the finger- poppin'-nellie act an d use that same sort o f style to ask, m atter o f factly, \" Y ou d o n 't like me?

A fter three years, my lover and 1 split, which was very pain\u00ad ful \u00a3uid ugly for me. I went out to C alifornia, stayed with a friend, licked m y w ounds for a few m o n th s an d began th in k in g about m usic again. W e went to see the Sex Pistols at W interland in early '78 \u2014 and it changed my life. 1 was convinced that this was the new thing, and it was trashing the old thing. 1 went home and cut o ff all m y hair. Fact is that at that tim e 1 needed to trash my whole life. 1 was sick o f the hair, the politically correct, the \" I 'm sad ab o u t m y lover.\" 1 thought, \" Fuck all that. I'm ready to move o n to som ething wild and raunchy, and this is it!\" I liked the m usic. I liked the attitude. I'd been such a sweet, nice, peace- loving hippie guy th a t 1 was ready to blow it o ff and do som ething wild. W ithin a m onth I was back in A ustin an d had signed on as a m odel a t this punk hair salon. I began to drink and p u t on the pounds, I d id n 't give a shit. I started getting into anonym ous sex, an d to m e, that fit right in with everything else. Get to k n o w you? H old your hand?

I m oved to A ustin w ith Steve in the fall an d im m ediately fell in with the nelliest crow d. They really did n 't share m y values. 1 got to feel like 1 was acting all the time. I realized th at I'd been ac\u00ad ting like I was gay w ithout being gay \u2014 w ithout being com for\u00ad table. O n m y 23rd birthday, 1 met D avid, a long-haired boy my age, at a local bar.

I was getting well know n on the punk scene for breaking bottles and slicing up my arm s. T he A ustin punk scene was really neat. There were a lot o f gay people, so if you w anted to be in th a t scene and like the best bands, you were pretty m uch forced to deal with som e homos.

I 'm on TV and in the new spapers. This is 1980. It was a very hard tim e. It felt like it was my partn er and me against the world. I w ound up com ing to the Bay A rea in 1980, and 1 was here for four years. I was the executive director o f the Pacific C enter for a couple o f years. I returned to New O rleans essentially to put my fam ily together and to deal with the fact that 1 was an incest survivor. My partner and I are very, very strong. W e've had a com \u00ad m itted relationship for a very long tim e, and prim arily now we're \u2014 it's hard for m e to say it but 1 guess I will \u2014 in a m onogam ous relationship. I'm really a holdout! But th a t's theway it's happening. A ny lovers that w e've ever had in the past can't deal in the face o f [the strength o f our relationship]. I trust her w ith m y life and with my d au g h ter's life. A nd I love other w om en. I've slept with other w om en, but she is m y bot\u00ad tom line. She's the light o f m y life and th a t's never going to change. Behind all w e've gone through it's unbreakable. O n to p o f that we w ork really hard. 1 believe that as activists \u2014 people w ho love this planet \u2014 this is o ur w ork, even as gay and lesbian people, we have been on the frontlines o f every struggle that anybody can think o f over the centuries. I believe, how ever, that we ca n 't live w ithout our lives, literally we can 't. T oo m uch, I feel, we w ork o u t o f a survival m ode, so th at when we have a relapse \u2014 a cold even \u2014 we die because we d o n 't have any reservoirs. W hat I said at the conference is that we m ust, wem ust have a reservoir o f love and support to do m ore th an survive, to thrive and, then after the thriving, to literally m ake art o f our lives.

H ealthy peo\u00ad ple as far as I'm concerned crave difference like they crave air. People o f color, lesbians and gays are really defended in their difference. It's like we become ghettoized by being guarded all the tim e against other people's hate, and we fail to recognize the straightness in us; w om en, the femaleness in them ; men, the m aleness in them ; colored peo\u00ad ple, the whiteness o r lightness in them . I believe th at when we d o n 't honor all o f the people we are, all o f the cultures that we are, th a t we keep self-hatred held w ithin. Interview ed by Karen Everett.!

I w ant it clear, however, th a t the Box is a gay club, and if som eone has a p ro b \u00ad lem with th a t, they aren't invited in.

I've found out th a t lots o f people really love this type o f music. I'm very glad to see how nicely it's m ixed, racially an d male to fem ale.

Even before she won the bronze medal in the Gay Games II bodybuilding com\u00ad petition, she was already well known in the San Francisco lesbian and gay community as a poet and activist. In 1970 she edited an early women of color anthology. Third World Women.

First, I w ant to say th at I did not grow up as a jock. 1 d id n 't like gym classes. I was n o t th at interested in organized sports. 1 d o n 't com e from an athletic background. In 1982, I was w orking in an office, an d I love to eat. So I found th at I was gaining weight, and I was feeling depressed and not feeling very good about m y\u00ad self. I was w alking around dow n\u00ad tow n O ak lan d on m y lunch hour, and I saw a very old, kind o f funky gym. Not one o f thesebrand new chrom e-and-m irror health clubs. It was a very dingy- looking, w hat I call an old-tim e boxing gym. A nd 1 went in there an d I looked aro u n d and I joined. I really enjoyed w orking out w ith the weights. It really does a lot for your confidence and your self-esteem. It's like, \" W ow! A couple weeks ago I could only do 7 reps w ith tw o pounds and now I'm doing ten p o u n d s.'' I also liked the way th at m y body was changing. I liked the way that I was looking. I also r e a liz \u00f3 th a t it did a lot to com bat m y depres\u00ad sion a n d feeling o f general apathy. So th a t's how I began. I started bodybuilding, but the in\u00ad tense training aggravated a back problem that I have had for ten years. I've had chronic back pain for ten years, an d both o f my doctors, w ho are very m uch into traditional medicine, told me to discontinue. So I stopped for tw o years. I d id n 't do anything for tw o years, and the pain in my back just stayed the same. A nother reason why 1 was in\u00ad spired to do bodybuilding was th at 1 w ent to G ay G am es 1, in San Francisco, which was in '82.this appreciation for the w ork that it takes to bring your body to a point like th is.'' So I said, \" I 'm gonna d o this in '86. '' So it's easy to just talk about w hat you w ant to do. B ut the m onths go by and the years go by. A nd all o f a sud\u00ad den it w as 1986 an d I h ad n 't begun doing anything yet. Well, at the beginning o f the year, m y best friend o f 13 years died o f cancer. A nd it was devastating for m e. It happened very fast, an d she was gone. I had a very iiard tim e. I couldn't go to work. I co u ld n 't leave the house. I was terribly depressed. I d id n 't w ant to ta lk to a n y o n e . I couldn't talk to any friends. I was ju st going dow n the drain. A nd on e day I said to myself, \" A nita w o u ld n 't w ant me to be like this. Because I'm dying.'' So 1 said, \" I'm going to go back too f training, I to o k the bronze m edal. A nd th a t was really pret\u00ad ty incredible. Because people train for years and years, and then there are people out there w ho take steroids. So for som e\u00ad one io do it in 3 Vi m onths, drug- free, is really a big accom plish\u00ad m ent. T h at's som ething I'm very pro u d of. W hy do I bodybuild? My cul\u00ad tu re is a culture th a t really under\u00ad values w om en. W om en have a lw a y s b e e n s e c o n d - c la s s citizens. Girl children used to be drow ned in the p o n d if they cam e from a poor fam ily in China. This is pre-R evolution. A nd girls w ho were b o m into rich families either had their feet bound or they had th eir m arriages a r \u00ad ranged. A nd I com e from a culture that tells girls w hat they ca n 't do and w hat they can 't sayand w hat they shouldn't do and w hat they c a n 't be. 1 feel like m y bodybuilding is a way o f changing that around, a way o f taking back all pride in our bodies and control over our bodies and control in our lives. I used to be a very shy, quiet, introverted person. W hen 1 got up o n that stage, m y friends were telling people, \" O h, you know , she's very shy and introverted.'' A nd everyone said, \" N o !\" B odybuilding is the art o f sculpting your body. A nd it's a sp o rt because we train with weights to get the muscle. A nd then we have to do a lot o f aerobics, especially as w om en, because we have a lot m ore body fat th a n m en have. W e have to do a lot o f aerobics to b u m o ff the body fat. A nd we go through a trem endous dieting process so that you can see the muscles underneath the fat. T h e dieting p art, som e people say, is 50% o f the bodybuilding. But I think it's m ore. Y ou have to have trem endous discipline to go th ro u g h it. A nd it's a diet unlike any other diet. It's ju st not anybody's diet. A nd th a t's why I call bodybuilding n o t only an art an d a sp o rt, b u t a science.

I K t.N S l PI *63\u00abA WIN-WIN BUSINESSWOMAN M A R IL Y N LANGFELD/Le5\u00bf7/a/2 Feminist A California resident for nearly a decade, Marilyn Langfeld operates her own successful graphics business. The thirty-something businesswoman met her spouse, Helen, while living and working in a Southern commune during the radical blossoming of lesbian feminism. 1 was b o rn in St. L ouis, M issouri, in '51, and I com e from a Jew ish family. My family m oved w hen I was a baby to N orth M iam i. My father died w hen I W 2 1S a little girl. 1 lived in on e house pretty m uch all o f m y c h i ld h o o d . T h e re w as m y younger sister and myself. She lives in S onom a now w ith her lover. M y m om w asn't very h ap \u00ad py about th at [that both her daughters turned out lesbian]. She w ent through a period o f blam ing m e for \" recruiting\" her. The tw o things w eren't real\u00ad ly related, except that Jo a n had m e as a role m odel. I d id n 't actually com e out u n \u00ad til I was ju st out o f school. I was in to physics and m ath, and 1 w anted to com e out to A rizona or C alifornia, where there are som e really good astronom y program s. But my m om did n 't w ant m e to cross the Mississippi. She d id n 't w ant me to be that far aw ay from hom e. I w as really happy to be far aw ay from hom e. I think it was easier for m e to com e o u t elsewhere. So I w ent to V anderbilt, which was a very strange place to be as a \" not- w ell-to-do.\" A nyw ay, I dropped out o f school after about tw o years. It w as am idst all the V ietnam W ar stuff, '68, '69, that era. I was r o o t l e s s . I w a s n 't in m y hom etow n. I d idn't know w hat I w anted to do for a living. I d id n 't have goals, but I had becom e a fem inist at that point. 1 m et w om en and m en at M o tiv e m agazine, which was a M ethodist college m agazine in a hotbed o f radicalism fo r N ash\u00ad ville. T he person that I m et there w ho becam e som ew hat o f an in\u00ad fluence on m e was C harlotte Bunch. She was involved in the youth C hristian m ovem ent; she w as still m arried and she was on the M o tiv e board o f directors. I was m ore friendly w ith people w ho w orked on the m agazine like Jo an n e C ook.w om en's press. We never called ourselves a lesbian press, and there w ere women w ho w eren't lesbians w ho w orked on the press, but we were m ost notable for printing the Furies, which was the connection with C h ar\u00ad lotte in Nashville. D uring this time I m et my lover [Helen]. I left the press after a year. A nyone w ho's w orked in a collective situation knows how it can be very hard, very intense, very w onderful and So I was all involved with w om en's issues. I rem em ber go\u00ad ing to a conference in K entucky with Jo an n e and C harlotte \u2014 a whole carload o f people. T h a t's when 1 started realizing I w as a lesbian. I lived in th e first w om en's house in Nashville. T he only gay people that 1 knew were tw o gay m en, and the w om an w ho I actually fell in love with lived w ith them . I thought m aybe she w ould be am enable to that sort o f situation, but she w asn't \u2014 at all! I w ound u p going to A tlan ta because I knew that there were lesbians there. A fter I m oved to A tlanta, Jo an n e C ook cam e out, C harlotte cam e out. So all o f a sudden everybody th a t I had know n in Nashville had com e out since I left. Then 1 got involved w ith So\u00ad journer T ru th Press. 1 w as on e o f the founders o f the press. It was aalso very em otionally draining. In A tlan ta, the people w ho were Involved w ith the press were prim arily in two houses, next door to each other, all collec\u00ad tives, all com m unal living. So we w orked together and we lived together or at least next door to each other, and there really was no w ay to get away. 1 was in it just ab o u t a year. T hen 1 becam e the first female union apprentice in a blue-collar w oodw orking trade. I realized that th a t w asn't w hat I totally w anted to do. It w asn't a good tim e, it w as hard to learn, it was physically very hard. L et's just say they d id n 't m ake it easy on w om en back then, not in A tlan\u00ad ta, G eorgia. There w as a guy w ho w ould com e over an d ver\u00ad bally harass me. W hen I was w alking by, he w ould throw nails at m e. So there was verbal and m ild physical harassm ent.H elen and I w ent up to M aine and built a yurt, w hich is a round house. A lot o f w om en felt like it was a good space to build. I didn't do m uch w orking then up there, but I loved it. I w orked in a preschool as a teacher. Then after a year and a half, we decided to com e to C alifor\u00ad nia. I was in my early twenties. I got a jo b in a print shop, back to the old skills o f the press, in San Rafael. W orked there for about a year, and then a design studio hired me, and I w orked there for three years. W hen 1 decided 1 was ready to do design, my boss said he w asn't ready to have any m ore designers. So I decided to leave and start m y ow n business. A nd th a t's been ab o u t 8 Vi years. I haven't prom oted myself as a gay business fo r a couple o f reasons. The type o f w ork that we do is really to p quality, and it's m ore expensive than \" com \u00ad m unity\" resources allow. It's m ore w hat corporations o r non\u00ad profits that have been funded can afford. W e d o a fair am ount o f nonprofit w ork. I w ouldn't call m yself a social\u00ad ist, and I w ouldn't ctdl m yself a capitidist. 1 feel like I'm som e\u00ad w here in between. All business is an agreem ent betw een tw o par\u00ad ties for the delivery o f som ething \u2014 either a service or a product. A nd if the two parties can agree o n a m utually beneficial ex-o f view \u2014 you d o n 't see yourself as having any power. It'll be 17 years in Septem ber (that Helen and I have been to \u00ad gether). People told us th at if we cam e to C alifornia, we'd break up! W e had a funny beginning to o u r r e la tio n s h i p . W e g o t to g e th er, an d we w ere only together for three m onths. 1 m oved into her com m une, an d she did n 't w ant th a t.

A fter a while 1 got in\u00ad volved w ith the gay organization on cam pus, an d this continued in m y senior year. Eventually I was m aking public declarations. 1 was frankly telling jjeople 1 was gay, a n d m y n am e becam e associated with the gay organiza\u00ad tions. But people didn't believe me! They d id n 't believe I was gay! 1 guess because 1 w asn't very The things I've been exposed to are really great \u2014 by great, 1 m ean varied and m ulticultural. I bring a lot o f that to the class\u00ad room . 1 was born in C hicago and went to the Latin School o f C hicago. W hen 1 grad u ated there were about 13 blacks in all the four classes, out o f the 250 or so students. 1 com m uted an hour to an hour-and-a-half every day to get to school, and som etim es I had to leave m y house at five in the m orning to get to the N orth Side at six. I w ent to school with the richest people in C hicago \u2014 the people w ho ow ned the base\u00ad ball and the basketball team s and the big stadium in Chicago. Their parents were doctors and lawyers, big-tim e bureaucrats. The people w ho lived o n the G old Coast and owned the best condom inium s. M y m other was a m aid in those condom inium s, my father was a butcher. I grew up on the S outh Side o f C hicago, a horri\u00ad ble com m unity. There was a lot o f violence, drugs and alcohol, unem ploym ent, poverty, rats \u2014 killer rats! Roaches, the whole bit. A nd so school was in some ways an escape. It was far away. It was white. It was very dif\u00ad ferent, it was like a fantasy land. High school took up m y bfe. D uring the sum m ers I would w ork two o r three jobs to afford the high school 1 went to. I becam e class president, 1 played basketball for four years, 1 wrotefo r the new spaper and for the literary m agazine. Som etim es 1 w ouldn't get hom e from school till 11 at night. W hen I was grow ing up, tw o people were really im portant to m e in encouraging me to write: G w endolyn B rooks and Sonia Sanchez. G w endolyn sponsored neighborhood poetry contests th at I participated in. T he prizes cam e out o f her pocket. She gave students her books, and she had a little prim er for w riting. Every year she'd rent space at the University o f C hicago, an d she'd pay for poets and their families to com e and read. S onia Sanchez was one o f the '60s poets, in fact headed the black studies m ove\u00ad m ent at San Francisco State. Sonia would take m e to political events and fundraisers for M ark H am pton, the Black P anthers,black history m onth, and after m y ju n io r year, I w rote for the school new spaper. 1 saw they w eren't covering things that I w as interested in, literary and black cultural events, so 1 re\u00ad viewed them .

Since m oving to C tdifom ia I've w orked at Laney College an d U C Berkeley as a w riting tu to r and then eventually as a w riting w orkshop leader. I'm talking about m aking $5.85 an hour. W orking 30 hours a week or whatever I could find. I did that for three years, and it turned into what I'm doing now . I develop writing assignm ents, I m ark student essays, I teach writing for an O akland public school. D uring the sum m er, I w ork for the Sum m er Bridge P rogram , a prefreshm an p ro \u00ad gram for Berkeley students en\u00ad rolled during the sum m er. A ndone thing that typically happens each sum m er is that I com e out to them , usually out o f necessity. A few years ago 1 had a very openly gay student w ho w as be\u00ad ing heckled by the guys in the w orkshop. I put it dow n lightly for a couple o f weeks. 1 took them eiside and said, \" 1 d o n 't w ant you doing this during my tim e, otherw ise I'll m ake things very difficult for y o u .\" It's the truth! But they proceeded to dum p on the guy an d once said som ething that was so offensive 1 had to answer, \" I'm gay.\" A nd m ouths just dropped. W e spent the rest o f that w orkshop a n d an entire other w orkshop talking a b o u t se x u ality issu e s. I t 's som ething th a t's happened over the years. I com e out because it's educa\u00ad tion an d because m ost o f the students d o n 't know anything about gay people or because they th in k they know a lot ab o u t gay people. By com ing o u t, it gives them an opportunity to start thinking about who the people are th at they know an d d o n 't know . T h at's why I do it. To shake them up. I com e at it from a historical or cultural perspective as well. In a session on strategies for writing. I'll bring in w orks by A udre L orde or Baldwin, som ething that addresses gay literature or gay history and culture. This year the class was reading The Plague by Cam us, and so I brought in an article from the Village Voice on A ID S. W e had a couple of w onderful discus\u00ad sions! I even got som e o f the students to own u p to their hom ophobia, which was a very interesting thing to negotiate, considering where we started on the first day o f classes w hen they nearly ran me out o f the class\u00ad room with their poison! T w o teachers 1 w ork w ith and w ho value m y w ork to o k m e to C hez Panisse for lunch recently, and they found out how m uch I m ake \u2014 $17,000. A n d they said, \" W hy do you do it? \" I said, \" Because I'm good at it and because I enjoy it. T h a t's why I do it.\" W hat 1 value ab o u t my w ork is the act o f negotiation, getting people to try an d ex\u00ad perience and to be aw are of things that they d o n 't have any interest in experiencing o r under\u00ad standing. I have to adm it th at it's pretty subversive w hat I do. I slip things in on the sly. I plant little seeds to m ake people question, dou b t and think. Interview ed by M arlon Riggs.

Interview ed b y C athy Cockrell.i GAY AMERICAN INDIAN R A N D Y B U R N S /C / m^ Founder Randy Burns is a Northern Paiute Indian bom in Reno, Nevada, and raised on the Pyramid Lake Indian Reserva\u00ad tion just outside Reno. He arrived in San Francisco in 1975 to go to college, and with four other Indians founded Gay American Indians (GAI), a social club designed to end the isolation o f Indians in the Bay Area and to provide a sup\u00ad port network. I think I knew I w as gay as ear\u00ad ly as five o r seven. I never did get a chance to explore until I was about 13, w ith older m en in my family as well as in the com m uni\u00ad ty where I lived at th e tim e.

But w hen I started G ay A m erican Indians in July o f '75, I felt obligated to tell m y parents, because I d id n 't want them to hear thro u g h hearsayearly twenties. W e started the club ju st for support. M any o f us were in college. M any o f us were w o rking dow ntow n, a n d we needed a support system . So we started a club.

I htid experiences w ith other m en very early on, an d it was real secretive. It was w ith m y cousins and friends o f the fam ily. O lder m en. But you knew they them \u00ad selves were heterosexual, and a lot o f them today are m arried and have children. T here's a w hole big process, I think, o f Indians being gay. A lot o f gay Indian people back on the reservation leave hom e to escape hom ophobia o r bigotry. A nd a lot o f gay Indians th a t d o stay on the reservation are usually ostra\u00ad cized. But they hang in there and they fight. A nd I give them credit. T here are m en w ho are bi\u00ad sexual by o u r definition o f gay m en o r o f lesbians. B ut they will n o t com e o u t an d say, \" Weil, I'm bisexual,\" because back hom e h 's really bad. The society o n the reservation is real harsh to th e issue o f hom o\u00ad sexuality. A nd to the issue o f A ID S, w hich a lot o f Indian peo\u00ad ple are n o t inform ed ab o u t. Plus there's p o o r health care. W hen w e started o u r club. G ay A m erican Indians, in 1975, we had five m em bers a t the time. Then we g o t up to lO an d then up to 15 gay m en. A n d a lot o f us were very young. W e w ere in ourtim e we never thought o f having discussions like, are you lesbian o r are you gay. W e ju st knew we were all Indian first a n d gay sec\u00ad ond. W e not only cam e together as a support group, b u t also as a group o f people w ho have a cu ltu re representing d iffe ren t tribes. A nd we still are on e big family. Things have changed. I see alot o f young people getting in\u00ad volved w ith lesbian/gay politics. O r th e In d ian leadership in A m erica. G ay young people are in th e fo refro n t, I think, in bring\u00ad ing A ID S education to reserva\u00ad tions. A n d a lot o f gay young people w ork in the urban p ro \u00ad gram s as directors. So I see a lot o f positive changes happening from the group th a t we started 13 years ago. T he only tim e 1 see the les\u00ad b ian /g ay com m unity reaching o u t to help m inority people, this includes gay Indian m en and w om en, is w hen they w ant to p ut together a big gro u p , like the N a\u00ad tional M arch o n W ashington. I still see D em ocratic clubs th at ex\u00ad clude a lot o f m inority people from participating in the p ro \u00ad cess. M ost o f th e leadership in the lesbian/gay com m unity have c lo sed -d o o r m eetings, secret m eetings that exclude people o f color, including A m erican In\u00ad dian m en and w om en. So I d o n 't really feel th at o u r com m unity is th a t receptive yet. I think we have a ways to go. In a n o n p o litical co n tex t, socially I th in k w e're pretty m u ch in te g rate d . S ocially, I rem em ber a tim e when going to bars in the C astro where they w ould ask fo r ID if you w ere dark-skinned. I think for the m ost p a rt socially we've been ac\u00ad cepted. Indian gay people are very cerem onial a n d very special. W e identified 135 tribes th at m ake reference to gay roles in N orth A m erican tribes. A nd that role w as usually a sham an role o r a m edicine role if you w ant to call it. A nd they w ere also crafts\u00ad people. A nd they were the diplo\u00ad m ats. T he elders today will talk ab o u t w hen the gay people in their tribes w ere special. A nd the m a jo r tribes, the Sioux, the N avajo, the B lackfoot an d m ost o f the m ajo r tribes today still a c \u00ad cept gay people in cerem onies be it the sun dance, the private cerem onies.

FANTASY LOVER P A T R IC K /G c ;'M c t/2, PWA Patrick's life epitomized the fast-track gay experience o f the 1960s and 1970s. Born in Canada in 1942, he lived in the gay Meccas of San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. He summered on Fire Island, went on motorcycle runs and joined the tonier gyms where the serious bodybuilders worked out. In 1986 P atrick was diagnosed with A ID S an d , shortly there\u00ad after, agreed to participate in an anthropological life history in\u00ad terview, from w hich this inter\u00ad view is culled. In agreement with the term s o f th at interview, we use only his first name. Patrick died last summer. W e include his com m ents for the universality o f his experiences and observations. \u00ab * Q uite candidly, I lived in a fantasy life probably from the tim e 1 can rem em ber. A nything 1 didn't like in the real world, I just did n 't deal w ith it.I've been gay since I've been 14. A nd m y p arents have know n since 1 was 16. It never bothered m y m other. W e used to laugh cind say, \" W ell, she'll alw ays have a shopping p artn e r.\" M y father always hoped that it w as a phase. It was n ot som ething th at he and I discussed. W hen I cam e to San Francisco to live, th at was probably th e zenith o f gay life as far tis ease o f interaction w ith people. [That] was in m y early twenties, an d it was the early '60s.

T he edges o f the T enderloin were popular also with drag review bars. In those days we used to have a group o f airline employees that used to have an orgy once a week. T here w ere 20 o f us, and we till had to bring a guest, but we could never bring the same guest twice. T hat was p art o f w hat San Francisco was about then. T he late '60s were great be\u00ad cause I was living in New Y ork at that point, and I was part o f Fire Island, and we did drugs. There was a w hole period in the '60s w here it was living for the w eek\u00ad ends. It w as sexual freedom probably like I had never ex\u00ad perienced it before \u2014 where if you w alked by som ebody fuck\u00ad ing underneath the boardw alk, you did n 't even tu rn your head. 1 d o n 't think I experienced synthetic drugs until som etim e in the early '70s. N obody 1 knew ran drugs, but we all took our pills o n F rid ay evening and S a tu rd a y m o rn in g , an d late S aturday afternoon, and early Sunday m orning. I used to get up in the m orning, d ro p a hit o f acid, run the dogs on the beach, com b m y hair back, lay in the sun an d Usten to m usic until one o 'clock w hen it was tim e to go to the rack for m idday sex. It was sort o f like going to the baths outside. In 1973 m y lover an d 1 m oved to W estw ood ILA ], and we sep\u00ad arated th at C hristm as.

It w ould be like going to W ildw ood but real bizarre. T here w ould be apparatuses hanging in the trees th at had am yl [nitrate]. T here was always this em phasis on S&M. It was m arvelous. There was a great sense o f com m unity. In the evenings the host club would always put on som e sort o f review. 1 rem em ber one group doing the R o ck y H orror Picture Show . It was always great fun. C om plete freedom o f sexualityMy last relationship in Los Angeles w as not a leather rela\u00ad tionship. It was a bodybuilding relationship, which is entirely another g ro u p o f people \u2014 and preppie. M y last lover, I just have no desire to com m unicate with. It w as a very ugly separa\u00ad tion and soured me on even the desire to ever have another rela\u00ad tionship for years. We separated in '77. I've n o t had a lover since. For me I guess probably w hat ended every single one o f m y form er relationships was m y un\u00ad willingness ju st to be m yself \u2014 just to say w hat was so for m e. 1 don't know if it was because I didn't know who I was, o r th a t I was so plugged into the fantasyrying ab o u t the possibility \u2014 it becam e a reality. I 'm in tw o support groups. W e're all basically at th e same point in our diagnosis. N obody is on the verge o f im m inent death, alth o u g h people have dropped o ut and died \u2014 I m ean, I g o tta be honest \u2014 but they d o n 't com e to group tow ards the end. See, I have this vision that I'm going to go to group until the week before I d ie . . . because I'm a d ram a queen! M y perception o f myself is that for a good p art o f m y life I held back sharing with otherpeople. Now w ith an unknow n tim etable with which to operate in. I 'm m uch m ore open, m uch m ore willing to be m e. I don't like the gam e-playing anym ore. I find it easier to sleep w ith myself. I d o n 't have any trouble being m yself at this pwint in m y life. 1 feel that I 'm com ing from a posi\u00ad tio n th a t's acceptable to me and the universe. I think I 'm a great guy!

Answering Service 6 2 6 - 1 1 1 8 Castro's Com m unications Crossroads Since 1976 messaging mail pagersP O T L U C K KATE BRANDT Over the Rainbow It should have been the best Parade yet. For one thing, the Parade starts off in the Castro this year. We could, of course, debate the symbolism of gathering in the Castro versus the sociopolitical import of taking over downtown San Francisco. But for me, the true significance of the changed Parade route is that this year 1 wouldn't have had to haul myself down to the Financial District on iSun- day morning (an indignity beyond mere corporeal inconvenience; if you work there, you know). Instead, I would just roll out of bed and on up 17th Street to watch Dykes on Bikes roar off into the sunrise. And, even better, this year 1 would have someone to hold hands with at the Parade. This may not sound like a big deal to you guys out there, but it's been statistically determined that the majori\u00ad ty of lesbians who boycott (so to speak)Manhattan before going our separate ways. And if you can't be in San Francisco for Pride Week, New York City ain't too shabby. (Well, in uutli, it's ex\u00ad tremely shabby, but that's another sto^.) In fact, June 1988 has been designated as Lesbian & Gay Pride and History Month by none other than Mayor Ed \" I-am-not-a-homo\" Koch, heralded with a big glossy calendar of events issued by his office. But the real significance of this trip for me is that it will be my first visit to Manhattan since I moved here five yean ago \u2014 and my first post<oming- Since it was her first Parade, too, we were like a couple of Dorothy-dykes in Gay Oz. the Parade do so because they refuse to be Single In Public on Pride Day. (Groups of women in matching T-shirts are exempt from these findings, since who can tell?) So, a good deal, right? Well, it could have been, except.. .1 won't be in San Francisco for the Parade this year. Worse yet, I'll be at a wedding. A fami\u00ad ly wedffing. In Staten Island, New York (if you're from there, you know). But though I cried with regret when the rainbow flags were raised on Market Street, this will in fact be a very special Pride Week. For one thing, my lover has to be on the East Coast the same time I do, so we'll be able to travel together and spend some time inout visit. The last few years 1 lived in New York, I was in the \"Yes-I'm-attracted- to-women-but-I'm-not-a-dyke\" mode. (You know the type: She makes>oi/ pay for the drinks since you're the \" real\" lesbian.) Fortunately, I had East C!oast friends who didn't yawn and say, \"Tell us something new, girl!\" when I migrated to Mecca and then said, \"Golly gee, 1 think I'm gay!\" (And they didn't laugh when I discovered that, contrary to my pre\u00ad coming-out fantasies, ^ Francisco did not have gaggles of sin^e lesbians at every vegetarian restaurant and alter\u00ad native bookstore. Berkeley, yes, but not San Francisco.)But even as a curious not-so-straight, I never went to a Parade in New York. So when 1 finally ventured forth in San Francisco, I was unprepared for the im\u00ad pact the day would have on me. Let's put it this way: I had tears in my eyes from the second I hit the BART station: throngs of lesbians and gay men at 10:30 on a Sunday morning! Then, when I reached downtown, I bumped into a friend \u2014 what were the odds of our rendezvousing if we'd planned it?! \u2014 and we watched the Parade together. Since it was her first Parade, too, we were like a couple of Dorothy-dykes in Gay Oz \u2014 or, more accurately, a couple of kids at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. We cheered and clapped and cried, and debated whether to ride a chopper or a mere scooter when we joined Dykes on Bikes the following year. And, when awomen's group to which we belonged came in view, we hopped in and marched proudly along Market Street with them. 1 only left the Parade route once, to dash into a store for an extra roll of (overpriced) film. Unlike those who purportedly believe that a camera steals one's soul, I believe that an event doesn't really happen unless I have a picture of it. Therefore since I won' t haveDave's return last week was tempered by his announcement that his column would now be (you should pardon the expression) biweekly.

I would like to thank Mr. Cady and the staff at the Sentine/ for providing coverage. His article has greatly assisted us in getting the atten\u00ad tion necessary to promote our cause. Our group now has a name, Kaiser Patient Advocacy Union (KPAU), and has formed several committees to manage our activities. We are current\u00ad ly planning a num*^r of tactics to enlighten Kaiser as to the gravity of our requests. We welcome any and all of the San Francisco Bay Area community who have HIV concerns and/or HMO con\u00ad cerns to join KPAU. The precedent that will be set by our actions will have ramifications on Kaiser facilities nationwide as well as other HMO or\u00ad ganizations. Our efforts as a group to alter the way the health industry is handling this epidemic are needed now more than ever. Don Handrick KPAU Media Committee Unacceptable Treatment To the Editor: I am pleased to see the community's attention focus on the quality of care offered to us by Kaiser Permanente Health Plan. As Ken Cady (Sen/wW, \" Unhappy Kaiser Pa\u00ad tients John Effing (Sen/iVif/, 6/17) note. Kaiser's treatment of AIDS, ARC and HIV+ patients is inconsistent, varying from excellent tocallous and inadequate. At recent meetings of a newly formed group. Kaiser Patients Advocacy Union (KPAU), about half of the Kaiser members present were satisfied with care received, and half had horror stories to report. No one, however, felt that Kaiser is in the forefront or even up to date in the treatment of HIV infection. ! find this unaccep\u00ad table. It is estimated that a quarter of the HIV patient load in San Francisco has Kaiser coverage. To date Kaiser has not prepared itself to respond to this challenge as an institution. It is up to us as Kaiser members in San Francisco to see that our health care is not just adequate but superior. Once again in this epidemic, it is time to become involved. It is impor\u00ad tant to hear from all those Kaiser members who have received inade\u00ad quate care in the past or who are con\u00ad cerned about the quality of care they are to receive in the future. I urge all Kaiser members in our community to attend a KPAU meeting. The next meeting is scheduled for 7:30 pm on June II in the MCC hall at 150 Eureka. Piul La C '4 > u iT e y e Youth No Excuse To the Editor: That Dave Ford would excuse the politics of a generation because of a felt need to \"dissociate itself from the preceding establishment generation'' is to dismiss the regressive, self-serving contents of the politics he ascribes to Ben Dhong's generation (which hap\u00ad pens also to be my generation). There are many younger gay men who are quite serious and articulate about ourifsr criticisms of racist, sexist and classist culture (whether straight or gay), yet Ford would have us believe that we can't really reject the selfish exploita\u00ad tion of privilege by the monied, edu\u00ad cated elite who have the \"luxury\" of keeping out of politics (which is exact\u00ad ly not what they are doing) because we're too young and our politics will change anyway. Although I would hope that every one's politics would continue to grow, absolving someone from responsibility for reasons of naivete or immaturity is an intolerable proposal. While, of course, younger people have different experiences (which means we have a lot to offer), so too do older people (which means they are the repositoriesof great cultural knowledge). Sharing our experiences rather than isolating ourselves by generation seems a much more viable political practice than denying gay culturo-historical development and failing to address the selfish political attitudes that are apparent among members of all generations. Scott Bravminn Unethical Conduct To the Editor: Your coverage of Vaughn Walker's senate confirmation hearing under\u00ad scores the substantial problems plagu\u00ad ing his nomination for federal judge- ship. For accuracy's sake, however.let me bluntly state that gay groups do mH oppose Walker because he \" represented\" the US Olympic Com\u00ad mittee. Walker wants people to believe that his nomination is being opposed by groups who dislike his clients. Nonsense. I and the other witnesses who testified against Walker's confir\u00ad mation work in the legal community as lawyers or researchers. Naturally, we strongly support our ovm right and that of others to represent or work for whomever we want. We stated this individually and collectively at the hearing. Moreover, as I said during the hearing, lesbians and gay men abso- Continued on page 20P O IN T O F VIEW An Eyewitness Account I Remember Stonewall On the tenth anniversary of the \u00a1969 Stonetwll Riots in New York City, Vito Russo prepared the following piece, which still has relevance to\u00ad day as w e mark the \u00a19th anniversary of the modern day gay and lesbian rights movement. It's been ten years since the riots in the streets, and the current cry seems to be \" Remember the Stonewall.\" Well, 1 remember the Stonewall. On\u00ad ly it was officially called the Stonewall Inn, and it was a regular hellhole. The pits. The bottom of the barrel. It was also the hottest dance bar in Greenwich Village. It was a bar for the people who were too young, too poor or just too much to get in anywhere else.VITO RUSSO The Stonewall was a street queen hangout in the heart of the ghetto. The place everyone loved to hate. Seedy, loud, obvious and sheer heaven. It had the best music, the toughest drag queens and the weakest drinks in New York Ci\u00ad ty. It was 1%9, and I didn't have a political thought in my head.old Judy or even the full moon which caused all the trouble that night. Something snapped outside the Stonewall which had been at the break\u00ad ing point all winter. There had been raids on almost every ghetto bar, and street gays had been driven from place to place like cattle. Summer was sud- Yet today we do not resist in the remembrance of StonewalU we acquiesce. When 1 ambled down Christopher Street one balmy June night and spotted a large crowd outside the Stonewall, I was pissed. I was missing something. Besides, I'd spent the better part of the afternoon and evening waiting in line to view the body of Judy Garland, which lay in its white dress at Frank Camp\u00ad bell's funeral chapel on Madison Avenue. But it wasn't the death of gooddenly bringing people out of hiding. They were people affected and informed by the antiwar movement, the women's movement and the student movement. There was a rebellious quality about gays which had never surfaced before. The police just picked the wrong n i^ t to raid yet another ghetto bar. When I arrived in front of Stonewall, the atmosphere was still quite festive.Various personages of grand demeanor and exotic affectation were exiting the premises to the whistles and cheers of a large gathering. It was good show. Gays answering back to the police was unique, but it was all so camp it seemed harmless. I was still enjoying it as spec\u00ad tacle when 1 realized that the crowd was not having a good time. 1 remember someone yelling, \" Why don't you peo\u00ad ple leave us alone for a change?'' It was a question I'd had too, but 1 never thought to shout it in the street. And then 1 saw that gays were not simply exiting, they were being excorted to police vans and taken off to jail. They didn't often arrest customers, preferring usually to squeeze the management; this was a real first-class operation. I sat. that night, in the low branch of an elm tree and watched a riot happen. Hearing gay people talk back for the first time startled me. I moved back into the crowd, afraid. 1 found refuge in a high place from which I could watch the action. It looked like real trouble to me. Gays on the sidewalk were throwing things at the police. They threw nickels and pennies, then rocks and cobble\u00ad stones from the street. There weren't enough police to handle what was hap\u00ad pening. A raid like this one was routine and had never met open resistance before. CJiief Inspector Seymour Pine, who led the raid, was caught in the barrage along with several of his men and Howard Smith, a writer from the Village Voice. The group retreated into the Stonewall, closing the doors against the advancing crowd. People threw bot\u00ad tles. Someone kicked open the doors and threw a flaming piece of paper in\u00adside. It was at this point, said Smith's report in the Voice, that the police in\u00ad side drew their guns and Pine shouted, \" I'll shoot the first motherfucker who comes through (hat door!'' I heard the sirens which held his fire. The rein\u00ad forcements swept the crowd back into Sheridan Square. 1 climbed out of the tree and went, too. I threw nothing and I shouted no slogans. Like Aunt Pittypat in Gone with the Wind, I grabb\u00ab! the smelling salts and hitched up the buggy as soon as the Yankees reached Atlanta. Most of the people 1 knew did not fight back. I was in the majority of the curious but timid who lent numbers to the brave fewThis time the organized reaction reached me. If they would shoot us in the streets for coming out of the closet, it couldn't be any worse than being forced to jump out of a window to stay in. I have been to nine p y marches in nine years. The event is increasingly respectable. People say this is good, this is the progress we fought for ten years ago. Yet today w e do not resist in the remembrance of Stonewall, we ac\u00ad quiesce. Homosexuality, of necessity, for the sake of progress, was turned into a sub\u00ad ject fit for discussion on TV. The \"p y experience\" was streamlined to make it as respectable as possible. The heart- / threw nothing and I shouted no slogans. Like Aunt Pittypat in Gone W ith The W ind, I grabbed the smelling salts and hitched up the buggy as soon as the Yankees reached Atlanta. who dared act. I just wanted to be left alone. I wanted the right to face ex\u00ad ploitation without having to worry about a vice cop spilling my drink. A few months later they raided the Snake Pit. This time they arrested 167 customers who were herded into a large room at the police station and held for hours. Diego Vinales, a 23-year-old Argentine in the US on a visa, panicked at some point during the night. Fearing deportation, he tried to escape by jump\u00ad ing from a two-story window. Vinales landed on spiked iron fence and lay near death for three weeks in St. Vin\u00ad cent's Hospital. On Christopher Street, I was handed a leaflet. It said, \" No Matter How You Look At It, Diep Vinales Was Pushed.\"land of the country was told, \" Accept us, we are just like you.\" While everyone is lobbying in the state capitol, trying to prove that p y b just as good as straight, I'm back on the streets at five in the morning. It's given me the chance to see that nothing has changed way down deep. It's still not safe on the streets, but it's home. I'll still take my chances. If they're ping to shoot me, it'll be because I'm not like them; I'm too much like myself to get in anywhere respectable. I remember the StonewalL It's around every comer.

We are preoccupied, and rightfully so, with securing our legitimacy in the legal system both as gay people and as a community disproportionately af\u00ad fected by AIDS. We are embattled politically over legislation to assure an- tipy violence is punished, that lesbian and gay parental rights are protected, that youth are afforded dipity and support. But, while we struggle in the civil arena, we can not ipore or allow society to ipore, that our lepl rights are only part of a larger picture. Our identity as intimate, sexual people is also a issue, and our relationshipsdeserve recopition on a plane equal to But still there is that hangup about \"sex.\" There are still some of our liberal heterosexual ones. The link between intimacy and sex is as important for p y people as it is for nonpys. It is comparatively easy to get the \"system\" to acknowledge that antipy violence is wrong and ought to be punished. Who could support crime? And increasingly, the pool of lawmaken prepared to include p y rights in the larger framework of civil rights is growing. There is a long way to go toward legislative victory, but wehave traveled a long way, as well, friends who think in their heart of hearts, that while we shouldn't be fired for being p y , there is something psychologically dysfunctional about same-sex relations. There is still a deep-seated belief that something is out of order, something didn't come out right. We are still not allowed to hold hands in public outside of our ghettos without fear of sparking at best a rude remark or at worst a riot. And then there are those tour buses that clog our streets in the Castro so boorish tourists can pwk. We are frequently referred to as a \"maturing\" community, a remark that reeks of paternalism. In fact, we are a powing communi\u00ad ty, networking with other aspects of the city's diverse poups and working together better within our own com\u00ad munity. When straight politicians and the \"mainstream\" press call us maturing, frequently they are alluding to thatpowth. But just as often, there is a sense that what they really mean is: Thank God the p y s on Hibernia Beach have put on their T-shirts and zippered up their libidos. The political agenda of gay rights will not sink deep, permanent roots un\u00ad til there is an acceptance that p y peo\u00ad ple's intimate relations are important and intrinsically valuable. AIDS has forced us all to reexamine our sexual practices, a process that transcends sexual orientation. As we confront our attitude toward sex, hopefully we will also transcend that bairier between p y and straight people and develop a genuinely under\u00ad standing rapport. We Are Family Change America's definition of fami\u00ad ly and you inalterably change the politics of this country. The nuclear family, buttressed by religion, has suppressed p y and lesbian identity. That' s why one of the most ex\u00ad citing evolutions occurring within our community is the emergence of p y and lesbian co-parents. The growing acceptance of co\u00ad parents, and domestic partners, in oursociety means that the next time your favorite right-wing politician sounds the theme of family, die image he evokes among the voting masses may be enlarged \u2014 and enriched \u2014 to include us. The redefinition of family that started with the accelerating divorce rate is the window of opportunity our community needs to sink permanent roots in society. PTAs and Cub Scouts may never be the same. Leonard Matlovich On the eve of the Freedom Day parade, Leonard Madovich slipped away from us succumbing to AIDS. Efforts are underway to memorialize Leonard at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington, DC, where his tombstone, already inscribed, reads: \"When I was in the military they pv e me a medal for killing two men, and a discharge for loving one.\" Next week IhtSentinel will publish a full account of a man whose place in lesbian and gay history is secured by his courageous confrontation with the mili\u00ad tary and his willinpess to serve as a role model dispelling the stereotypes about our community.

HUHA AT THE COURTH OUSE KEN CADY Closets A friend visiting San Francisco for Sunday's Lesbian and Gay Pride Celebration was bemoaning the slate of affairs for our community in this day of constant bad news on AIDS, increased attacks on gays and defeats at the ballot box. All of those things are seriously affecting the morale of our community, but it was hard not to counter my friend's despair by pointing out the efforts being made on a daily basis by members of our community. pointed. If he needed an interpreter, a gay or lesbian interpreter is available. All of the court proceedings could be transcribed by a gay court reporter. The attorneys could have gay or lesbian in\u00ad vestigators work the case up. If pretrial diversion were an appropriate resolu\u00ad tion of the case, then a gay or lesbian caseworker could be appointed. If pro\u00ad bation were more appropriate, a gay or lesbian could be the person's probation officer. \"And if you made a false accusa\u00ad tion,'' I told him, \"then after he was released from jail, he could get a gay lawyer to sue you!'' One does not need to stop there to realize that our community has become a significant part of the criminal justice system. The courthouse has gays and lesbians in every area, from typists and\" If you were assaulted on the streets of San Francisco,'' I told him, \"you could report that assault to a gay cop, who might radio your description of the assailant to a lesbian cop, who might chase and capture the person and hold him for your identification. Then, your suspect could be taken to the Hall of Justice and booked into jail by a gay deputy sheriff. The deputy could then file his report with his lesbian super\u00ad visor. The next day, a gay bailiff could pick up the inmate and take him to court. \"It's entirely possible that the judge could be our own Herb Donaldson or lesbian Mary Morgan. The DA filing the complaint might be gay, as well as the clerk talcing the filing. \" If the suspect needed a public defender, a gay or lesbian could be ap-clerks to lawyers and judges. Even the person responsible for controlling the caseload of the individual courtrooms is a gay man. Rich Boles. Not only are there gays and lesbians in the sheriff and police departments, they have their own association, the Golden State Peace Officers Association, often known as Pigs in Paradise. Although it's been a long time since a new gay or lesbian lawyer was hired, both the Public Defender and the District Attorney have gay supervisors. Gordon Armstrong, head trial attorney for Public Defender Jeff Brown, is theremember that many of the supporting roles are filled by other gay and lesbian employees. When I actually stop to consider how many, it makes me realize how much better off we are this Gay Pride Day than we were several years ago. Even if we're in the midst of an epidemic, we're still maintaining a strong profile. All of the upfront gays and lesbians in the Hall of Justice can be proud of their contributions. It's their willingness to be open about who they are that makes it possible by those who deal with us. Although I realize that there are different levels of ability or desire to be open about one's homosexuality, I' ve never been proud of the closet cases who do us more harm than the run-of- the-mill bigots. The more we come out. Vve never been proud of the closet cases who do us more harm than the run of the mill bigots. The more we come out, the easier it becomes for all. highest ranking, but Brown has just ap\u00ad pointed assistant Ron Albers to be prin\u00ad cipal attorney in cha^e of misde\u00ad meanors. Several weeks ago, DA Arlo Smith assigned gay lawyer Chuck Haines to be principal attorney super\u00ad vising the DA's misdemeanor prose\u00ad cutors. Readers of this column are familiar with many of the frontline players in the courthouse, but it's important tothe easier it becomes for all. * One might think that the San Fran\u00ad cisco Bar Association would utilize a lit\u00ad tle of its space in the June issue of its magazine, San Francisco Attorney, to inform its membership about the con\u00ad tributions that gays and lesbians have made in the legal community as well in the bar association itself. Instead we are treated to four glossy pages of an \"in\u00adterview\" with Vaughn Walker, the partner in San Francisco' s largest law firm of Pillsbury, Madison, and Sutro who has been nominated for a federal judgeship following his successful attack on the use of the word \"Olympics\" by the Gay Games. We learn that Walker didn' t \"active\u00ad ly solicit\" the nomination and that he is \"surprised\" by the intensity of the op\u00ad position to his application by the gay and lesbian community. Walker was asked some pretty tough questions, such as \" What qualities do you think you'll bring to the bench?\" (He cites objectivity.) The interview was conducted by an attorney who is an associate at Pills\u00ad bury, Madison and Sutro. Although 1 am sure that there is no connection, we learn later in the magazine that the firm pays the membership fees for all of its attorneys to belong to the Bar Associa\u00ad tion. Later still, the firm is commended for its $50,000 donation to the Bar Association Bidowment Fund. Further on in the magazine is a pro\u00ad file of the 15 years of service to the city by the La Raza Centro Legal nonprofit law office. Their contribution deserves recognition, no doubt, but I wonder when Mr. Sutro is going to open his copy of the magazine to read a profile of Bay Area Lawyers for Individual Freedom (BALIF), or a profile of one or more gay or lesbian attorneys mak\u00ad ing headway on behalf of their com\u00ad munity. In the meantime, enjoy yourself and be proud! Contlnuad from pago 18 lutely embrace the principle that law\u00ad yers ought not be judged merely be\u00ad cause of the clients they choose to represent, any more than clients ought not to be deprived of legal services sim\u00ad ply because of vrho they are. And it is only gay Americans who have been specifically denied by Congress access to legal aid through the Legal Services Corporation. Our problems with Walker have nothing to do with his choice of clients, but his unethical conduct dur\u00ad ing the course of litigation. This in\u00ad cludes his mistreatment of a dying man. misstatements and overreaching. We are disturbed by Walker's limited courtroom experience, which includes only two cases before juries. He has virtually no criminal or civil rights ex\u00ad perience, and has had just one pro bono client in 16 years of legal prac\u00ad tice. Walker's failure to satisfy his ethical duty and resign his member\u00ad ship in the Olympic Club is also deep\u00ad ly troubling. Walker chooses to deflect public scrutiny of his multiple shortcomings by blaming gay people for disliking his clients. The testimony from thehearing soundly repudiated that claim. What was clear and not com\u00ad municated was the catalog of civil rights, women, gay and legal groups who adamantly reject this nomina\u00ad tion. Californians deserve better. We in\u00ad tend to continue the fight until we get an exceptionally qualified jurist who will bring honor and substance to the bench. T.J. Anthony, Chair FMA Task Force on the Judiciary Sterling Symbol To the Editor; As general manager of the NAMES Project, 1 feel compelled to respond to Tim Taylor's criticism of the Quilt. As gay and lesbian people and San Franciscans, we are all keenly aware of the toll of the AIDS epidemic, the individuality and humanness of each loss, and the love of a community committed to compassionate care. This is not the case throughout the country. The cocoon of San Francisco is surrounded by ignorance and bigotry. The only solution is educa\u00ad tion. But education is ineffective if Americans continue to think that AIDS does not affect them or people like them.The Quilt changes all that. It is im\u00ad possible to visit the Quilt and not feel its impact. The experience of 80,000 San Franciscans in Moscone Center last December is now being shared by over half a million Americans in 20 cities. As the Quilt travels from city to city, it leaves in its wake thousands of people who have understood the magnitude and humanness of the epi\u00ad demic for the first time. It also has motivated thousands of new volun\u00ad teers in the fight against AIDS and raised over $300,000 for AIDS organizations. As you know, the emotional ex\u00ad perience of creating a panel is per\u00ad sonal and intense. The Quilt's ability to touch the hearts of so many lies in these very personal experiences. The thousands of panel makers united by the Quilt are declaring that their sons/lovers/friends/parents are not faceless statistics, but human beings who were unique, were loved, and are remembered. This message is always relevant. Tim's comments about the growth of the project have merit. People who made panels when the project was a neighborhood venture certainly have an emotional investment in the pro\u00ad ject. But throughout our growth, ourgoals have not changed. We remain committed to I) offering people a creative outlet for their grief through panel-making onrf 2) showing the humanity of the epidemic through displays. Contrary to Tim's remarks, panel makers want their memorials displayed. Every day we receive dozens of new panels. Each comes' with very explicit directions about what cities the panels should be shown in. As we become more of a national and international project, panel makers are making panels not just to process their grief but to make a very public statement with their per\u00ad sonalized memorials. We have an ob\u00ad ligation to display their quilts in their cities. The Quilt is not \" straight America's favorite symbol of dying faggots.\" It is the national symbol of unity in the fight against AIDS, a reminder that all life has value. It remembers all who have died. Straight or gay, black or white, old or young, rich or poor. Like many AIDS organizations, the NAMES Projert has it roots in the gay community and is closely iden\u00ad tified with the gay community. We can all be proud of the image of our T U \u00a3 OFPAID ADVERTISEMENT -\u00ca\u00cakC:community that the Quilt projects. It shows our diversity, our strength and our ability to love. It confronts straight Americans' stereotypes and forces them to acknowledge our humanness. Tim Taylor should call a few friends in other cities, or travel to a tour city. I am sure he will find the Quilt's message not only relevant but needed. And the book, in the hands of this nation's decision-makers, could do more to transform national AIDS policy than anything to date, including the Quilt itself. Michael J. Smith General Manager A Growing Need To the Editor; To all persons considering becom\u00ad ing a volunteer at Shanti Project. I would like to say; Do it! You will not be brainwashed. You will not be turned into a cult-worshipping zom\u00ad bie. Your self-will will not be altered. You will be allowed to formulate and express your own opinions without fear of harassment. I became a practical support volunteer with Shanti seven months ago. As a volunteer, I am no more knowledgeable of staff problems at Shanti than is the general public. My contact with the staff is limited to one volunteer coordinator, and our con\u00ad versations are usually limited to client-related issues, not staff politics. There has been a trememdous amount of negative press regarding Shanti recently. Regardless of the out\u00ad come of the various allegations being made, I cannot stress stongly enough the continuing need for volunteers. Over 1,100 clients are currently using Shanti services, and the need con\u00ad tinues to grow. In the midst of this devastating epidemic, there is always a demand for more volunteers.

Swindall's Fourth Congressional District includes most of eastern and southeastern metropolitan Atlanta, where, according to the Atlanda gay paper Southern Voice, at least 10,000 lesbian and gay Republican voters reside. In a series of questions put to him by lesbian and gay challengers, the two- term representative admitted it was his \"constitutional duty to protect the rights of gay and lesbian citizens.\" Later, though, he told the increasingly hostile audience that he thought \"indi\u00ad viduals ought to have the right, as employers, for example, to discriminate against homosexuals in their hiring practices. And I don't think it is the federal government's responsibility,\" he added, \"to say to an employer that you may not discriminate against some\u00ad one who is homosexual.\" Swindall spent two-thirds of his time dealing with catastrophic health in\u00ad surance legislation. Under questioning he repeated his position on national health insurance, saying, \"I would op\u00ad pose any provision that would bring AIDS patients under any catastrophic health plans.\" As for AIDS education, he stressed that it should not aim to in\u00ad form the public on how to avoid con\u00ad tracting AIDS, but at \"educating our\u00ad selves in terms of who has AIDS. One of the problems that we have right now is a schizophrenia in this country in terms of whether we really want to know about AIDS to the point that we're willing to mandate testing,\" Swindall said. Later, when asked why a gay man or lesbian should vote for his reelection. Swindall acknowledged his antigay stance stating, \"If the only issue is my attitude about homosexuality, I can think of no reason for a homosexual to vote for me ___If the issue is 'Is Pat Swindall going to change his opinion about whether homosexuality is a natural act?'the answer is no.\" BC Prostitute Murders Continue VANCOUVER, BC \u2014 The murder of two prostitutes in a single week this spring has brought renewed attention to the murder of women prostitutes inBritish Columbia \u2014 21 in all since 1985, according to the Vancouver pub\u00ad lication Kinesis, with the five most re\u00ad cent being women of color. The BC group Prostitutes and Other Women for Equal Rights (POWER) says the murders are related directly to Bill C49, an anti-soliciting law that went into effect three years ago. De\u00ad signed to get sex trade workers off the streets, the bill has not done so, POWER says, but has endangered their lives instead. \" Prostitutes have been blamed for every social ill in this city from house fires to AIDS,\" declares Marie Arring\u00ad ton of POWER. She says violence to prostitutes has increased more than 100% in the last year and that POWER now receives reports of 60 cases of rape each month compared to 20 per month a year ago. Many of the murdered women had received court injunctions banning them from their safer work territories. \"The girls end up way off somewhere having sex in the back of a car,\" said a volunteer at a church drop-in center for prostitutes. POWER is encouraging people to write the BC attorney general demand\u00ad ing the repeal of Bill C-49 and to write local papers protesting sensationalistic media coverage of the murders. Georgians Host Largest Gay Benefit Ever ATLANTA, GA \u2014 In what was billed as the largest lesbian/gay fundraiser in Georgia history, over 600 people at\u00ad tended a $l50-a-plate dinner for the Human Rights Campaign Fund May 21 in Atlanta.

So ruled the British Press Council recently in re\u00ad sponse to a complaint lodged by the London-based Wimbledon Area Gay Group. The gay organization's complaint followed press coverage of the Church of England's decision not to ban gays from the clergy. Archbishop Robert Runcie, clerical head of the Church of England, didn' t agree and the headlines in local papers read \" Runcie Backs Ban on Poofs.\" Fundamentalists' Discriminatory BUI Shelved MADISON, Wl \u2014 An antigay bill proposed by a fundamentalist-run camp for boys was set aside recently by the Wisconsin legislature. The so-called Rawhide Bill was proposed by a camp of the same name that wanted legis\u00ad lation to create exemptions to the state's Fair Employment Act by allowing religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, marital status or religious affiliation. The Wisconsin legislature instead opted to clarify an existing law that per\u00ad mits legitimate religious organizations to grant preferential hiring treatment to members of their own creed. After con\u00ad sulting with gay activists, legislators clarified the law to allow preferential treatment only if the hiring position is clearly related to the religious teachings of the group in question. 3,500 Walkathoners in DC BALTIMORE, MO - Some 3,500 people walked the 10-kilometer perimeter of the National Mail for the second annual DC AIDS walkathon\" Next Step\" May 15. The estimated $220,000 in pledges will go to 12 local organizations serving people with AIDS \u2014 36% each to the Whiteman Walker Clinic and the Human Rights Cam\u00ad paign Fund's AIDS lobbying program; the remaining pot will be divided among ten other groups. Although the event drew 500 more walkers than last year's walkathon, it raised $45,000 less in pledges and fell short of organizers' goals. Officials in attendance included two city council members and a DC public health commissioner. Honorary co\u00ad chairs not in attendance were Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and Mayor Marion Barry. Actress Lily Tomlin, in town with her show at the Kennedy Center, also sent her support and regrets. a Gays Part of Amtrak's 'Family' LOS ANGELES. CA \u2014 Same-sex couples and gay/lesbian families are eligible for reduced fares on Amtrak's Family Plan, Amtrak officials stated recently. The policy clarification came after Walter Wheeler, president of Couples Inc., was not allowed to buy a reduced fare Family Plan ticket for himself and his male partner. In a telephone conversation following the incident, Amtrak director of Com\u00ad munity Affairs John Jacobsen clarified the official policy, saying the National Railroad Passenger Corporation issues Family Plan tickets without regard to the sex of family members. Anyone can obtain a Family Plan ticket, he said, by presenting him or herself as the head of the household and others as members of the family. The couple must be willing to say they are married to obtain the reduced rates, which are full fare for the head of the household, half fare for the other adult family member, and quarter fare for children between 2 and 11 years ofage. No Same-Sex Marriages in Tennessee NASHVILLE, TN \u2014 Two persons of the same gender cannot legally marry in Tennessee, according to a nonbinding 1 ^ option issued recently by the state attorney general Michael Cody. Cody issued the opinion at the request of several county clerks, who had re\u00ad ceived marriage license applications from lesbian and gay couples. Cody opined that while same-sex marriages are neither authorized nor prohibited under Tennessee law, the law's language, specifically its use of the M A R K E tV S T R E E T I O P E N IN G S O O N !!

Rio Group Protests Homophobic Judge RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL \u2014 The Brazilian gay group Triangulo Rosa has filed a lawsuit and a complaint against the president of the Court of Justice of Pernambuco for a published comment that he would never allow a homo\u00ad sexual to become a judge. Triangulo Rosa, in its suit, says that the judge's statements in a Rio publica\u00ad tion violates gays' constitutional rights. The case has also been brought to the attention of the Brazilian National Assembly, which is in the process of drawing up a new constitution. Brazil\u00ad ian lesbian and gay activists want the constitution to expressly prohibit dis\u00ad crimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Triangulo Rosa can be contacted at CP 14704, 22412 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

Now, two-and-a-half years later, after numerous peaks and some valleys, I am healthier than ever. 1 spent December of 1985 in a deep valley.. .namely, I was in SF General Hospital with sepsis and AlDS-related neutropenia. I had a total white blood cell fWBC) count o f 600 . Normal is 5.000-10,000.1 now have a WBC count of 6,700 with a T<ell count of 3,201! Normal T-cell count is 570-2285. Grateful is not the word, I am happily floored! \" What did y o u r/o ?\" is always the question. I am on the Jay Baldwin Pro-been a grueling, exhilarating journey. I have learned a lot. Why is my AIDS story so much dif\u00ad ferent than the media version? Why didn't I h ave/In Early Frosll I thank my experience in living, pre-HIV, as painful as it was, for all it did to make my body indestruaible and my at\u00ad titudes viable and flexible. Hard experience as a heroin addict and sex-for-sale man taught me to ig\u00ad nore newspaper/television views on drugs and sex. All this practice made it much easier for me to completely ignoreallopathic drugs; and I did not follow MD orders when I was hospitalized \u2014 except when doctors' orders coincided with my own judgment. I forgot about medicine and got into health. Discovering Alternatives In 1985, my friend and co-worker, Pam Olton \u2014 nowZJr Olton, certified acupuncturist, insisted I start Chinese medicine. For three years, the staff at Quin Yin Acupuncture Center has been both knowledgeable and lovingly sup\u00ad portive. 1 found that my \" valleys\" oc\u00ad PERSONAL B E S T JAY BALDWIN gram, which I designed for Jay Baldwin in 1985, and which has been tailored and streamlined for higher peaks and lesser and shallower valleys. From 1981 to 1984, as a professional caregiver, I nursed many \" gay cancer,\" \" gay pneumonia,\" GRID and finally AIDS patients. I met many wonderful people, both co-workers and patients, in several San Francisco hospitals and home hospice programs. I helped many men to \" die,\" and their deaths were every bit as valid and suc-'i did xe,\" nys Jay Baldwin, \"that if I wanted to continne living I was going to mn the skow.'' cessfiil as my current health. But I did see quite clearly that if I wanted to continue living in this physical body, 1 could not depend primarily upon medicine and doctors; instead, I was going to have to be my own doctor and run the show. It hasthe media with what it had to say about the fatality of AIDS. This is an im por\u00ad tant part of the Jay Baldwin Program. In its very earliest incarnation, the Jay Baldwin Program consisted simply of negatives: 1 did nol go to any teaching hospital clinics; I rarely took The Healing Alternatives Foundation 273 Church Street San Francisco, CA 94114 (415) 626-2316A Non-Profit Corporation Open Tuesday through Saturday 1;00 P.M. \u2014 5:00 P.M.

I read many holistic health books and many books on metaphysics. I ex\u00ad perienced the teachings o f Louise Hay, Mary Richards, Jason Serinus, and I learned much from the writings of Van Ault, Irving Oyle, MD, and many others. All of this changed many of my attitudes and belief systems. I lost my fear of death because I stopped believing in death as the end of everything. I view death as the end of the physical body but nothing more. Death is one step, among many, on a long journey. To make a long story short, \" death\" is an optical illusion! Seeing AIDS Differently I also started looking differently at AIDS. Here is how I look at what peo\u00ad ple call AIDS; There is a new virus called HIV. There is nothing strange or unique about a new virus or bacteria; they are always coming in just like new people are always coming in, and they have every right to exist as much as I do. With this in mind. I decided to stop \" fighting\" AIDS and, instead, change my body so it can live in harmony with its new guest, HIV. When I talk to my HIV, I always announce myself as \" This is your host speaking.\" In adapting to this new virus, the types of WBCs in my blood have changed. Normally, 70% of one's W B Cs a re b a c te r ia fig h te rs (neutrophils), and 30% are virus fighters (lymphocytes and monocytes). Now, my blood is 70% lym\u00ad phocytes and monocytes and 30% neutrophils. 1 have a gut feeling that in\u00ad tensive visualization and meditation facilitated this change. The rest of the Jay Baldwin Program I developed through trial and error. Handling Addictions Perhaps the most miserable error was two years ago when I thought, \" If I can beat AIDS, I can get off methadone maintenance.\" Wrong! Well, at least I learned that apples and oranges are dif\u00adferent. The year I spent off methadone was truly hell, and I was not healthy. I had to learn to ignore some people's prejudicial views on opiate maintenance and make my own reality. And my own reality is that I need to be on methadone \u2014 for now, anyway. I had to learn all about my addic\u00ad tions. This entailed understanding the nature of addiction, and the definition of addiction I like best is by Janice Phelps, MD. She's an addict herself and has treated more than 5,(X X ) ad\u00ad dicts. She states. \" An addiction is the compulsive and out of control use of any chemical substance than can pro\u00ad duce recognizable and identifiable unpleasant symptoms when use of the substance is stopped. Such addiction is driven by an inborn physiological hunger in the addictive person and is frequently intimately related to depres sion.\" She estimates that four out of ten people are addictive. 1 strongly recom\u00ad mend her book. The Hidden Addic\u00ad tion, for anyone struggling with addic\u00ad tions. Now methadone is my sole drug. In the past, I was ad d ict^ not only to opiates, but not least, sugar. I thank God I didn't like cocaine or speed. For those who are interested in my detox method, check out the programs in Dr. Phelps' book. T hat's what I used, and it was successful for me and 5,0(X) other ad\u00ad dicts, including its author. Chanting and Meditation Another facet of the Jay Baldwin Program is chanting. I do morning and evening gongyo, which is a practice in volving chanting, incense, lighting a candle and offering food and water to Buddha. The chant 1 use is \" Nam- Myoho-Renge-Kyo,\" and I use it many, many times daily. It grounds and focuses me and, in a few words, puts me in the here and now. Chanting raises my energy level and keeps it clean. I was introduced to this practice by one o f my life mentors, Tina Turner. Since high school, I had long been familiar with Tina, and when the Ike and Tina Turner Review faded in the early '70s, I did not expect to see Tina again. When Tina re-exploded in the early '80s, it was obvious that she was working on a different level than before. In a Life magazine article, she at\u00ad tributed her renewal to Buddhist chant\u00ad ing. At that time, I knew that was what I wanted to do. Related to this is visualization. It needs to be learned, and it needs to be practiced. It's powerful medicine, especially when combined with medita\u00ad tion. I went to Rainbow Foods and bought three books on visualization, took them home, and practiced, prac\u00ad ticed, practiced. While I 'm heavily into my chanting, I simultaneously form mental pictures \u2014 I see myself healthy now and five years from now. I imagine healthy white blood cells. I see myself smiling and happy. I visualize myself handling adversity better than I did before. What 1 visualize is what I get. I had to learn balance in wak- ing/sleeping, exercise/rest. And I had to educate myself in dietary balance and the optimal use of vitamins and nutri\u00ad tional substances. I tend to go heavy on vitamin C and calcium. The other sup\u00ad plements are \"as needed\" as deter\u00ad mined by my gut feelings. For instance, 1 take the amino acid glutamine for drug cravings, phenylalinine for energy, tryptophan for calming myself and spirulina for solid nutrition. TTiis is only a partial list of nutritional substances I found useful. Once again, self- education is the key to finding what is best for you. Continued on page 24= - . v ' - ' ' ^ . - - . New Age Debutante: Coming Out Spiritually In my mother's youth, society held coming out parties for young ladies and gentleman in which they were formally introduced as socially responsible, eligible citizens. The imagery of a coming out party is comically fascinating to me, because as a rite of passage it mirrors what happens when a person emerges spiritually. You become a spiritual debutante. There is a process of coming out spiritually as well as socially. You make your debut into a new consciousness that touches not just your social/politi- cal stance, but expands your love for life and sense of identity. As a spiritual debutante, you put on the gown and gloves of self-love and spiritual responsibility, while carrying with you a sense of vulnerability and openness that was once common infor you. Confronting the Saboteur If you consolidated all of these characters into one, you'd come up with the saboteur. The saboteur is the negative side of your ego that just can\u00ad not stand it when you start to thrive. The ego wants to stay in control, not take instruction from the Higher Self which is what starts happening when you come out spiritually. The saboteur has many weapons. The major ones are fear of success, low I N N E R S B h C E V A N R. AULT eligible young bachelors/bachelorettes. In the new consciousness, you come out into the world and say, \" Here I am, ready or n ot.\" Not only do you come out to everyone else, you come out to yourself \u2014 and a whole new agenda of potentials, possibilities and responsi\u00ad bilities. I call it \"the debutante's ball.\" The Debutante's Ball At the debutante's ball, you have one escort: your Higher Self, the living link between you and God/Goddess/Source. It is the spark of the divine in you, car\u00ad rying all the insight and illumination you need to progress. With the guidance of your Higher Self, you are empowered to express yourself with genuine magnificence. You discover wondrous capacities in you that were dormant but you'd had all along; intuition, deep compassion, w holesom e hum or, spontaneous creativity. These capacities support you contri\u00ad buting to the world you've come out to with passion, and they enable you to make a substantial difference in your immediate environment. To come out to yourself in this way requires, for many people, some kind of catalyst. Major traumas are terrific for this; there's nothing like getting thrown against the wall of human limitation to draw your attention to needed change. It certainly gets those upper chakras pulsating again. You d on't have to wake up with trauma, however, and I'd really recommend that you take a gentler route. You can start right now, wherever you are, and choose to come out of the murk because you want to, not because you have to. Whatever course of action youchoose, whatever catalyst does the job \u2014 once you're spiritually out \u2014 you reclaim the power of love you always had. And you can begin immediately releasing the need for hardship. At the debutante's ball, joy works best. At your debutante's ball, you'll be taken around to meet other participants in your human drama, and your Higher Self will gently whisper to you what you need to know about them. \" That one's your fear of giving and receiving love, and that one standing over there is your resistance to change. See that one in the shadows across the room? That's your ideal of responsibility. That one with its back to you is your refusal to own your power. Come on, you'll have to be in\u00ad troduced to them all.\" Your Higher Self will gently support you in healing these unsavory parts of yourself, the parts that are entrenched in the murk of lower consciousness. Just when it seems like you're climbing the ladder of success and respectability, one of these characters will try and ruin itself-esteem, feelings of unworthiness and lots of denial. The saboteur goes all out with these weapons to shoot down your success before it occurs. It knows that if it fails to do this, your vic- tim/raartyr act may end along with the drama of self-sacrifice. Then the Higher Self is in control. As a responsible debutante escorted by your Higher Self, you'll get to see how you ruin things for yourself. It can be very sobering to observe how your unconscious sabotages your progress. For example, a friend of mine told me about the homeopathic remedy his health practitioner prescribed for him. This remedy stimulated all kinds of positive qualities in him so powerfully that it helped lift him into great well\u00ad being. Then, someone offered him some cocaine, which he accepted. The effect of the drug canceled out the homeopathic remedy's positive in\u00ad fluence. To put it simply, cocaine made him feel \" like shit.\" Why did he sabotage M m I.

Williams & Martinet 433-0285 Allorneyi At Law ) 150 Spear, 11th Floor T San Francisco, CA 94105his own well-being? \" I just didn't feel like I deserved it.\" In my own inner journey, I used to sabotage the success of my healing practice through some self-created drama. Such a drama would impair my ability to be a clear channel and force me to take stretches of time to repair the damage. No success could be sustained in that context. Only gentle self\u00ad confrontation and setting firm boun\u00ad daries for what I'll allow in my ex\u00ad perience changed that pattern and sup\u00ad ported me in releasing the saboteur from my work. Gratitude also helped as lot; just gratefully accepting the goodness of the moment neutralizes the \" I don't deserve\" mind chatter. Of course, the negative side of the ego is refined only with much time and ef\u00ad fort. It's not a quick transformation, and it takes all of one's life to master it. Beyond Denial: Owning Your Power Transforming the saboteur from enemy to ally is quite a process in itself, and I haven't space to go into it here. But no spiritual debutante will create that healing until the saboteur's in\u00ad fluence is faced straightforwardly. Denial is especially dangerous here; \"Gasp! I'd never do a silly thing like that!\" Or. \"/ don't have a negative side to my ego. I've already handled all that.\" There's a reason that the underbelly of awareness is called the unconscious. Don't be so certain you know what's in there. The victim/martyr role is accepted when responsibility for your affairs is denied or totally projected onto exter\u00ad nal elements: other people, events, history, weather, even your wardrobe!\" They did it to me,\" whines the vic\u00ad tim/martyr, \" it's not my fault.\" But after the thousandth time, these plain\u00ad tive cries wear thin, sounding more like a broken record than genuine under\u00ad standing. Certainly external elements have a role that intersects with yours, and they impact your reality for better or worse. But nothing and no one else can deprive you of love's presence, which is your divine birthright. Only you can do that. The divine birthright must be claimed. The refusal to own your power leaves you floundering in the murk or, as they say in my native South, \" up shit's creek without a paddle.\" The on\u00ad ly power you absolutely require is enough energy to grab onto your birth\u00ad right and connect with your Higher Self. Even if you don't have the energy, a capable healer can claim it for you. and if you're genuinely receptive, yo u 'll manifest your highest good anyway. Remember \u2014 you didn't attend this coming out party without an escort. You're no wallflower: the Higher Self will take you forward every step o f the way if you'll consult it. Facing Pain with Patience One of the pressures the spiritual debutante faces is the need to be perfect. You do want to look your best, natural\u00ad ly. Behind all the Dippity Do and Maybelline, there can be some deep pain. Being over-attached to looking good can cause you to go into more denial. Some of that comes from your own insecurity, and some is due to New Age peer pressure and the glib jargon it employs. It can make it feel unsafe to face personal pain because you're ex- Conilnued on next page V a n R . A u lt Psychic Support Ready to take your life up to a new level ot well-being?

You're encouraged to go from one emotional high to another. If something hurts, it hurts. No amount of pretending will change that. It just postpones the healing process. Contrived emotional highs are not the goal of coming out anyway. Reaching your full potential is. The best advice at your coming out party is to move pa\u00ad tiently with all of your issues. Enlightenment is an ongoing process. The Release from Resistance Coming out spiritually can be the release from years o f resistance. In that resistance is the denial of your spiritual nature, a repression of that which has been falsely claimed as the province of twisted religions, emotional rip-off ar\u00ad tists and agents of bigoted social con\u00ad trol. Certainly you recognized that your inner self was too precious to get into bed with such factions. And who wouldn't rather be a cynical atheist/ag- nostic than a sheep led to slaughter? Fortunately, your choices are more multidimensional than that. Coming out spiritually can be a huge relief: You can drop the hard-bitten cynical shell around you. You find that it's safe to open up the higher consciousness, lo admit you have a Higher Self, and that love is, indeed, the guiding force you want behind your life. This makes it far easier to give and receive love in your life. There's a greater of volume of love available to you (limitless, in fact). Your sense of innocence returns. As a spiritual debutante, you're ready to step out and say, \" Here I am world, like it or n ot.\" You present yourself at the debutante's ball arm in arm with your Higher Self and join the dance o f your own transformation. Whatever drag you choose to wear, whatever time you show up, whatever has catalyzed your emergence, this rite of passage affects every part of your being. Your spiritual coming out party is truly a new beginning and a fun one at that. See you at the debutante's ball!

The Impact o ff AIDS But while we defeated the Briggs and L aR ouche initiatives and survived A nita B ryant and Jerry Falwell, A ID S has taken a terrible toll. In 1981,225 cases o f A ID S were reported in America; by spring o f 1983,1,400 cases; by sum m er o f 1985, 15,(X)0 cases; an d tw o years later, 40,0(X) cases.

Continued from page 42 Lesbian Sex in the '80s by Camille Roy Photographs by Anne Hamersky' old straight friend prom pted m e, and I found m yself staring at her, distracted. C ould I tell her a b o u t the strip show 1 went to last week? S hould I take her to one? The most interesting things which had happened to m e lately were flirts and dirty jokes, which 1 d id n 't think she'd ap p re\u00ad ciate. The last tim e w e'd met, she had been in\u00ad volved in the antiporn m ovem ent. I cleared my th ro at. \" Things have changed around here,\" 1 began. Later it struck me how true that w as. A decade that began with fierce debates am ong lesbians about straight porn seem s to be closing with strip shows and (safe) sex parties. San F ran \u00ad cisco has becom e hom e to a lesbian porn magazine called O n Our Backs. Perhaps this period o f inventiveness and experim entation among lesbians has a parallel to w here gay men were before A ID S began exacting its toll o f death and fear. And perhaps it could end, if A ID S b ec o m e s m o re w id e sp re a d a m o n g w om en. But a t least for now , I think o f w hat has been emerging am ong lesbians as a sexual dialect, or dialects, at once playful and sharp, contradictory and pas\u00ad sionate. 1 rem em ber K ., once my room m ate, w ho'd curl up o n a big chair in the living room and invent nam es for her butch girl\u00ad friend. \" IT is taking me out to n ig h t,\" she'd tell m e. O ver tim e \" IT \" evolved into \" The C reatu re,\" which becam e \" H elen\" and, finally, m ost gloriously, \" W a n d a.\" F or me the m em ory of \" W an d a\" hasalm ost erased the w om an's real nam e. N ow K. has a new lover, also nam ed K ., so m y friend refers to their com bination as \" M r. and M rs. K .\" M rs. K. (my friend) is the sharpest player I 've known in w hat I'm calling a lesbian sexual dialect, so w hen I began preparing my thoughts for this assignm ent, I im m ediately arranged a get-together over coffee. W hat, I asked M rs. K., should 1 say about lesbian sex? \" Ju st d o n 't m ake it jiggle, jiggle, jiggle and lick, lick, lick,\" she replied. T hen she w ent on to describe the dildo she and M r. K. just bought, and its nicknam e \u2014 \" the fam ily jew els.\"My conversations w ith M rs. K. w ork the territory o f taboo \u2014 som e silly, others pro fo u n d \u2014 and isn't that w hat com edi\u00ad ans do? Finally, the audience is hysterical, laughing at their ow n stupidity. This rem inds me o f my sexual history \u2014 played out by w ord o f m outh, som ething tasty to give and receive. O ver tim e, conversa\u00ad tions, rum ors and jokes am ong lesbians revised practically everything I h ad thought possible about sex. It was M ari, for exam ple, who taught m e \" how insatiable a w om an could b e ,\" at a p arty which I spent m ostly on her lap.She had her hand on my hip; occasionally it w ould slyly drift under my sweater. T hat night M ari was wacky and radiating heat, her eyes shining, as she entertained us with tales o f her sexual exploits. Once, she relayed, she had sex in a phone booth on the corner o f 18th and M ission, o p \u00ad posite the Doggy D iner, w here the whores used to stroll. It w as early on a sum m er evening. W hen we acted incredulous shety. It really becam e a bore. So after m eetings, we ran to the bars. You couldn't talk ab o u t w anting a w om an, except very loftily.\" The problem was rooted in the lan\u00ad guage o f power. It has rules, am ong them that evidence o f pleasure underm ines a u th o rity . A n executive must keep \" a grip on him self\" to control others; dom inance starts under the skin. Pow er is always im \u00ad This sexual dialect has a quality o f improvisation. It is urban. Unsettling, Undoing, A n expressive, explosive moment \u2014 understanding words o f sex in relation to m v bodv. gave us the details: the phone booth painted up to the w aist, the other w om an on her knees, e tc . . . . * * Perhaps I think o f w hat has been em erging am ong lesbians as a sexual dialect because m y ow n parallel is the black English I heard grow ing up on the South Side o f C hicago. It was a m ark o f dispossession yet also a creative stream o f speech, and far livelier than w hat anyone else could talk. Irony, play, antagonism stretched the sound and m eaning o f \" standard E nglish,\" and there was som e\u00ad thing in the black dialect which m ade even my grim neighborhood yield. W hat is happening now m ay be the opening up o f a kind o f erotic conversa\u00ad tion w hose roots go back to the '50s, the era o f b u tch /fem m e. \" I did not learn a p a rt, ' ' J oan N estle writes o f com ing out at that tim e, \" I perfected a w ay o f loving.\" The m ix o f play an d display she describes (in th e H eresies \" Sex Issue,\" 1981) rem inds me o f m y friends today. But Nes- tle's stories also rem ind us how the b u tc h / fem m e couples in th e Village during the '50s w ere far m ore vulnerable to assault. She explains, \" M y understanding o f why we angered straight spectators so is not th a t they saw us m odeling ourselves after them , but ju st the opposite \u2014 we w ere a sy m b o l o f w o m e n 's ero tic autonom y, a sexual accom plishm ent that did not include th e m .\" Nestle further de\u00ad sc rib e s th e \" c o d e la n g u a g e \" th a t developed fo r their erotic world: / loved m y lover f o r how she sto o d as well as f o r w hat sh e did. Dress was pa rt o f it \u2014 the erotic signal o f her hair at the nape o f the neck, touching the shirt collar; how she held a cigarette; waved her h a n d .. . all these gestures were a style o f self-presentation that m ade erotic co m \u00ad p eten c e a p o litic a l sta te m e n t in the 1 950s.. . . B atches were kn o w n b y their appearances, fe rn s by their choices. I think o f this quote as I step out into the street in heels, fishnets, reddened lips; my lover in black o r gray, a glossy dark shirt with a narrow collar, a leather jacket. H er hair is graying, her eyes are dark blue. She hops on her m otorcycle, I settle behind, my hands aro u n d her hips o r secretly ex\u00ad ploring her pockets. It is not the elements o f display b u t their com bination that gives me a sly pleasure. Like I've stolen som e\u00ad thing. \u00bb * * D uring the '70s, the w om en's m ove\u00ad m ent com pletely absorbed this sexual underground. Lesbianism becam e com \u00ad m only understood as a \" political state\u00ad m e n t.\" Because we were part o f the w om en's m ovem ent's struggle fo r legit\u00ad im acy, lesbian sex had to be reconstructed in politically \" p u re \" term s. In an ironic tw ist, lesbianism had to appear untainted by pow er plays in order to be incorporated into a fem inist agenda for pow er. T he key issue fo r me is one o f language. The lesbian dialect o f the '50s was under\u00ad ground an d had a quality o f expressive freedom in pursuing erotic pleasure as the focus o f com m unity life. W ith the surge o f fem inism in the '70s, as w om en ad o p t\u00ad ed th e language o f social and political pow er, this was suppressed. T he w om en's m ovem ent, w rote A m ber H ollibaugh in the sam e H eresies issue, \" becam e this really repressive m ovem ent, where you d id n 't talk dirty an d you d id n 't w ant dir-itating itself, is really individuals \" acting like\" a sequence o f images. Their self- control is a social agreem ent and a m eans o f entitlem ent. In public the pow erful can be counted on to act like \" figures o f , au th o rity ,\" and reproducing that image m aintains their position. But under an econom y o f control, pleasure in corn-closed and a smile cam e o n to her lips. \" T hat was interesting,\" she said, \" but you only slapped one side.\" So I slapped the other, w ith my fingers instead o f my w hole hand. \" You did it differently that tim e,\" she observed, and I w atched her soft cheeks flush. \" I w ant to keep you o ff balance,\" I said. * * 1 w ant to draw attention to som ething which is not there. A peculiar feature o f the lesbian com m unity is o u r invisibility; thus I 've heard butch w om en described as \" the image that can 't stand the light o f d ay .\" This is a m ark o f oppression but it also gives us a kind o f buffer zone, or b rea th in g space, o u tsid e th e d em o \u00ad graphic. N o advertisem ents aim to sell les\u00ad bians fem inine hygiene spray. T he smiling faces o f ads are a form o f control through resem blance, but a com m unity o f female sexual perverts resembles nobody, and nobody desires to resemble us. T here's a quality o f ironic freedom we possess, simply because we're not a tiuget o f that scrutiny. T he O xford English D ictionary defines m arginal as \" close to the lim it. . . beyond which som ething ceases to be possible.\" A n accurate description o f o u r location, Ion the stairs, telling m e a funny story \u2014 som ething they're not supposed to be talking about, the \" French m a id \" they w ere with at a sex party. \" H er French ac\u00ad c e n t,\" Bette begins, \" w as so b a d !\" Ruth finishes, and they lean forw ard, laughing so hard they can hardly breathe. It's not ridicule m oving them , m ore the presence o f the ridiculous. So w e're all part o f it. This sexual dialect has a quality o f im\u00ad provisation. It is u rban. U nsettling. U n\u00ad doing. A n expressive, explosive m om ent \u2014 understanding w ords o f sex in relation to m y body. So how a b o u t som e dirt on me? \" Get dressed,\" she says (today it'll be black lace and som e big fake pearls), ' 'and then com e here and d o ju st w hat I say.\" W hich is exactly w hat I wemt. \" Spread your legs, honey.\" T h e re 's a kind o f hap\u00ad piness in this today fOr m e; I d o n 't feel it's unendurable at all. I t's w eird, though, to be know n so well, like she's got my story in her hands. \" G ive it u p , girl,\" she says, and o ff I go, m elting into a blue sky that throbs with the chords o f h ard rock guitar. T he boy next d o o r plays heavy m etal, and today it's a redone classic: \" Som ew here over the ra in b o w ,\" trills a thrilled D orothy, th ro u g h o u r walls \u2014 m unity life drifts to the m argins. A nd here, the m argins, is w here les\u00ad bians are, am ong others. Yet th ere's an im aginary quality to this lesbian location, perhaps because we are invisible perverts \u2014 society isn't looking at us, so o ur gam e o f \" acting like\" is ab o u t experim ent and aro u sal, not social pow er. New configura\u00ad tions becom e possible. I'm rem inded o f Lee, a w om an whothink, w here we are not . \" real\" women and certainly not \" real\" m en. T he powers o f definition are exhausted at this boun\u00ad dary. They cannot cross, except through parody. So, for exam ple, there is the view o f a butch lesbian as an inadequate m an. It rem inds m e o f a \" b u tc h /fem m e\" m eet\u00ad ing I once attended w ith m y beloved. O ne w om an \u2014 femm e, blond hair so kinky she pushed it out o f her face w ith a defiant She was wearing a man suit from the '40s, baggy pants, blue sm oke curling from the tip o f a thin cigarette. Her round cheek was so soft it reminded me o f one o f those pictures o f Collette in drag. fascinated me for a period because, though butch, she's a m asochist.

I t's a lesbian sex m agazine w hich started in the sum m er o f 1984. We call it ' 'E ntertainm ent for the A dventurous Les\u00ad b ia n .\" It contains fiction, pictorials on d if fe r e n t e ro tic th e m e s , n o n fic tio n features on lesbian sexuality and lesbian lifestyles, political com m entary especially relating to lesbian sex o r ''the lesbian con\u00ad d itio n ,\" and book an d video reviews. O O B is, we hope, constantly breaking stereotypes an d exposing us to lesbians w ho are different \u2014 at least different fro m th e lesbian fem inist clique I cam e o u t in. I'm constantly surprised by it. How would you describe the current state of lesbian erotica? T he great thing a b o u t lesbian erotica right now is th at th ere are no form ulas. E verything is wide open. If you have a fantasy you w ant to publish, put it out now before the scene gets too big, to o en \u00ad trenched. T his is the tim e, because w e're in th a t seven-day G enesis period, at about d ay three. T h ere's a creative freedom that years later w e'll look back on and be really nostalgic ab o u t \u2014 how we used to let our sexual im aginations be so personal, so ec\u00ad centric. T his is th e eccentric period because there's no consensus on w hat everyone likes. (Laughs) W riters, artists, m odels should really go for it. How is it different publishing for lesbians than it would be publishing for some other audience? I w ould say the difference lies in doing som ething erotic fo r w om en rather than m en. I think if I w ere doing a sex m agazine for straight w om en I w ould be getting the sam e range o f response. 1 tend to be aw are o f our audience in term s o f people w ho think w e're ju st G o d 's gift to lesbians or people w ho think w e're S ata n 's agent.

They grab you and you d o n 't understand them an d they scare you or they anger you. T hat happens to people w ith O O B all the tim e.How is AIDS affecting lesbians? How im\u00ad portant is safe sex? W e at O O B are very interested in les\u00ad bians and A ID S. O ne o f the first things th at strikes us is w hy lesbians are n 't in\u00ad cluded in the discussion. T he hopeful answer to that is, \" A ha, w e ca n 't get it. W e always knew we w ere the superior race.\" (Laughs) I d o n 't th in k th a t's the reason, rather I think it's because o f les\u00ad bian invisibility. They d o n 't discuss us because w e're not recognized. As far as safe sex, 1 give a lot o f credit to the m agazine fo r exploring this. If we h a d n 't brought up safe sex the w ay wehave, would anybody have brought it up? 1 d o n 't think so. Lesbian safe sex was only being discussed in the m ost elite sex ed u ca\u00ad tion circles. Y ou had to go to the Sex In\u00ad stitute on Bush Street if you w anted to find out about ru bber dam s.

H ow do we know w h a t's going to h appen next? I know I'm interested in having a sex positive environm ent as m uch as I can, w hich is really going against the stream right now. I wjmt to get the idea o f safe sex into people's heads. I w ant to get them o u t o f this \" yuck, it's canned spinach\" attitu d e and into checking it out. I have a really G irl Scout attitude a b o u t it. In m y colum n I fetishize safe sex, talking about doing things with it th a t I think are really fun or convenient. W hen we did the pictures for the safe sex colum n I wemted them to look sexy, because people are just w rinkling up their noses. I hate that attitude. It's so stupid. T here's tw o techniques going o n to get people to do safe sex. O ne is the fear tech \u00ad nique, w hich is by far the biggest ca m \u00ad paign. T he o th er is eroticization o f safe sex. A nd, fine, I 'll be one o f the five peo \u00ad ple w ho are trying to eroticize safe sex.

T hey're both there, and once the gate is o pen you can't close it. Would you like to leave any messages with our readers? I have tw o m essages. Lesbians should recognize that we are the experts on fu ck \u00ad ing. Everybody th o u g h t we were experts on oral sex b u t actually straight people caught up in th a t departm ent a long tim e ago. W e're the only people w ho d o fu ck \u00ad ing not based on th e penis-vagina m odel b u t with our hands an d fingers an d toys. T h a t's why w e're the G -spot experts, because we know how to touch a w o m an 's clit and cunt in w ays th a t straight people never im agined. W e should take over all the m en's m agazines an d do articles ab o u t fucking because we know m ore ab o u t fucking than anybody does. P eople c a n 't even im agine w hat we know. Lastly, I have a political message. I wish lesbians w ould tak e censorship personal\u00ad ly. I wish lesbians w ould see how it is kill\u00ad ing our com m unity.

(707) 887-1332 FORESTVILLE, CA 95436N D Graphic Sexuality During Lesbian/Gay Pride Week, San Francisco serves as a hotbed of gay culture. There is much to be seen but there are also come glaring oversights. The vitality and diversity o f gay culture is represented by the film festival, musical events, PBS screenings of gay- related films and videos, not to mention the plethora of parties that spring from the energy of the parade. This energy level, however, does not enter into the local gallery scene. D uring the past year there have been a fair num ber o f m a\u00ad jo r exhibitions o f gay interest \u2014 G eneral Idea and Ross Bleckner figure m ost prom inently in my m em ory \u2014 but during June there is nothing that coincides sp e cific ally w ith G ay P rid e W eek. It is difficult to discern the rea so n s fo r this u n b a la n c e d focus. It m ay be that few artists are interested in participating in a gay-related exhibition o r that galleries ju st aren't supportive. T he problem m ay also lie w ithin the com m unity itself. These type o f events require tim e, planning and interest from a dedicated group o f people. D uring the past two years A rtists for C om m unity Life (A C L ), an organization o f gay artists, put together exhibitions th a t coin\u00ad cided with G ay Pride W eek. Last year's exhibition, a benefit fo r an art w orkshop for PW A s, encom \u00ad passed a variety o f m edia an d ex\u00ad hibited a strong sense o f artistic cam araderie. A C L, perhaps due to a lack o f com m unity support, no longer exists and, as far as 1 can tell, no new organization has been form ed to fill the gap. A few weighty issues m ake this an aw kw ard void. T he n otion o f art being exhibited and appreci\u00ad ated for its artistic success ratherport and validation. If the city's m ayor can support gay film \u00ad m akers, why is it that local m useum s and galleries do not directly acknow ledge gay artists? A lthough it brings up m any difficult questions o f aesthetics and artistic credibility, it is im \u00ad portant to address gay-related art in exhibition form o r critical discourse rather than ignoring its existence.

Jorja Fleezanis, who sits in the second chair of the first violins at the San Francisco Symphony and has the important-sounding title of associate concertmaster, has been offered the position of acting concertmaster o f Edo de Waart's Minneapolis Symphony. If things work out as planned, Fleezanis will wow her Minneapolis colleagues in her acting position and the season after next she will become the concertmaster o f that orchestra, the first woman concertmaster of a major American orchestra. P erhaps we have undervalued Fleezanis' w ork because it is dif\u00ad ficult to assess the individual talents o f a m em ber o f the string section o f an o rch estra.

T he advantage was once expressed by a m em ber o f the SF O pera C horus, w hen he idly com m ented one day th a t the soloists w ho cam e to tow n to sing at the opera were all o f them frightened all o f the tim e. The lim elight on the soloist produces a glare that can easily distort the personality o f an individual m usician.

T h is p ro b \u00ad lem m ay not be so b ad for the w oodw ind and bass players because o f the lim ited num ber of instrum ents on each line an d the relative abundance o f solos for them , but for the strings, 1 think, the problem is very real. J o rja Fleezanis, o f course, is one o f the soloists a t the sym\u00ad phony. She stepped in to the lim elight recently w hen she gave one o f the most m usical perfor\u00ad m ances o f the 1987-88 season in her rendition o f Roger Sessions' Violin C oncerto (1935), under the b ato n o f E do de W aart back in Jan u ary just before the strike. M uch o f the difficulty with m usic like the Sessions concerto is for the perform er to hear in the densely chrom atic w riting not the dissonance, but the con\u00ad sonance. Reezanis played not only the notes, but the m eaningform ances. A urally speaking, though, the Sessions concerto could n o t rival Fleezanis' p erfo r\u00ad m ance o f Sam uel B arber's C o n \u00ad certo (1941) for the Bay A rea W om en's Philharm onic in one o f the larger dow ntow n churches la s t N o v e m b e r . F le e z a n is show ed in the Barber the sam e feeling for the song o f the piece as she did in the Sessions, but in addition to the interpretation, she also offered a sum ptuous sound with which she su rro u n d \u00ad ed her listeners. But there has to be another w ay in which orchestra players can express themselves singly w ithout invoking the terrors o f the soloist role. T he answ er, o f course, is cham ber m usic, and the real value o f Jo rja Fleezanis to San Francisco has been the w ay in w hich she has contributed to the city's cham ber-m usical life. T o her colleagues in the sym \u00ad phony, this aspev. o f Fleezanis' career is a model o f an active m usical intelligence w o rking itself out in an euena that both highlights one's individual talent an d still enables one to w ork as a team .

In that stolen hour, 1 wasgifted with a musical experience that 1 shall not soon forget. T h e quartet began the M ozart (the first o f the set dedicated to H aydn) rather shakily, bo th inonto track an d m ade o f the group a stellar exam ple o f com \u00ad mitted yet polished string play\u00ad ing. If the M ozart was w itty an d profound, the H indem ith T hird (1922) was a cry o f anguish, deeply beautiful in its haum onies and searingly expressive in its melodies. D uring the M ozart, the quartet had m elded them \u00ad selves together into a unit o f rem arkable force and precision; in the H indem ith, they becam e part o f the em otional storm o f the music. A nd the dinner at hom e was very good, too. It m ust be obvious th at 1 hope that the San Francisco Sym \u00ad phony can offer Fleezanis a deal that will keep her in this city. Certainly 1 d o n 't think that we should let her go w ithout m aking som e effort to keep her.

And no wonder, it's another Touchstone production \u2014 Disney's nostalgic attempt to revive the old Hollywood studio magic with contract players and \" corporate culture'' (the '80s version of auteurism).

Before I give the im pression that I am entirely panning the m ovie, I need to em phasize how funny m uch o f it is. M idler and T om lin, o f course, are due m uch o f the credit, w ith their w him \u00ad sical interpretations o f the sisters and their fascinating chem istry. The idea o f casting them as m ism atched twins som ehow fits with their identical status as icons o f the gay com m unity w hose styles are diam etrically opposed.

Both M idler and Tom lin lend those roles a poignancy o f dis\u00ad p la ce m en t th a t enriches the film 's hum o r trem endously. F or all the pacing and ex- pjository problem s, the script does o ffe r a lot o f m ajor laughs. It's also a delicate achievement to sustain a double level o f m ean\u00ad ing in the dialogue for such a large p a rt o f the film, when the sisters are responded to by others as if they were their twins.

They don't pressure you to say you love them or besiege you with messages on your answering machine, and they don't involve the risk of a trip to jail \u2014 except vicariously. The only draw back is that th e y 're o fte n c lu tte re d w ith m eta-m acho heroes and hyper\u00ad fem m e females w ho do little m ore than faint or wait to be rescued.

N o w a d a y s m o re a n d m o re strong w om en characters arejoining these illustrious ranks. Recent exam ples o f this trend can be found in The W om an- sleuth A n thology: C o n tem p o \u00ad rary M ystery Stories b y W om en, edited by Irene Z ahava, and Lessons in M urder, a novel by Claire M cN ab. W om ansleuth features q uite a variety o f plots and characters.

The differences betw een these and m ore conventional m ysteries are telling. A m erican detective stories usually have a hero, often the first person n a rra to r, w ho dictates the point o f view an d a certain code. Even if the code is cynical tm d extrem ely lim ited, as with Sam S pade (\" If som ebody shoots your p artn e r, y o u 're sup\u00ad posed to d o som ething about it''), nonetheless, it constitutes a m oral im perative. In W om ansleuth, alm ost all the heroines are aw are of their second-class status as w om en and have devised their ow n in\u00ad dividual, creative ways o f deal\u00ad ing with the situation. This adds another dim ension to the stories. The battle o f the sexes is th e I central issue in Rose M illion Healey's \" A N eat C rim e.\" This tale is a v ariant o f the old \" bv- the-book co p vs. free-spirited private in v e stig a to r\" conflict th at's been aro u n d since S her\u00ad lock H olm es.

T here is a difference between good design and th at which ex\u00ad cludes pretention and the ap \u00ad pearance o f a lavish expenditure. T he printed m aterial for th e 12th annual Lesbian and G ay Film Festival is a striking, successful synthesis o f art, political correct\u00ad ness and m arketing. T om Bo- nauro, the festival's graphic de\u00ad s ig n e r , s ta te s t h a t \" g o o daesthetics give political content added credibility,\" which is ex\u00ad actly w hat this austerely beauti\u00ad ful w ork achieves. B onauro, one o f San Francis\u00ad c o 's forem ost young graphic a rt\u00ad ists, sees good design as \" chang\u00ad ing the perceptions connected w ith im a g es.\" F o r the film festival piece he utilizes a pho to \u00ad graph o f a young boy and girl, a still from Derek Ja rm a n 's The Last o f England, to create a p ro\u00ad life, presexual, positive image. W orking w ith this idea, B onauro attem pts to broaden the scope o f the film festival audience. His design is not lim ited by a specific gender o r sexually explicit image. H ere, art and m arketing are in\u00ad separable. B onauro further suggests that good design can exist outside o f its original function to com \u00ad m unicate as an enduring piece o f artw o rk . I f a design piece wins an aw ard, it is featured in exhibi\u00ad tions an d reprinted in graphics annuals. This lends credibility to the artist, while at the sam e tim e propagating the event or idea. A nd there is also the added bonus o f well-designed pieces ending up fram ed on walls or taped to the refrig erato r far beyond the tim espan o f the event. W ell-designed an d thought- out public images, produced ac\u00ad cording to w hatever financial m eans, are one o f the most pow erful tools we possess.

Huzzah! Mercury has final\u00ad ly decided where to go and what to ' wear. As of the 24th of June, it has gone direct. However, this planet of information and clothing selection ^ will not be giving us the usual in- ' tellectual confidence that is associated with this forward mo\u00ad tion. The reason for this is that Mer\u00ad cury, when retrograde in Gemini, was doing it with a retrograde ! Venus in Gemini \u2014 all month long. So, Venus, dealina with relation\u00ad ships and money and real values, can for now be frustrated in areas of final decision-making. Take advantage of the delay as , the stars attempt to take our relating and what we will \"buy\" to a higher level of acceptance. But, please \u2014 don't think that when Venus goes direct on the Fourth of July, (you've got to learn to read an ephemeris) relating will suddenly be spritzed with Chanel. More on this at a later date. In the meantime, it's like I said about values and relationships \u2014 because as Mercury goes direct, the Moon goes into the sign Scor\u00ad pio. It's a great day for a parade. Feature red! Feature purplel Feature lipliner\\ Feature buns!Feature a vibrant time. The above applies to all signs. ARIES (Mar 21 - Apr 19): Ad\u00ad justments and agreements in rela\u00ad tionships look great on Friday, but before the week Is out, you'll be wanting to edit and amend some of your previous comradely dialogue. The Full Moon on Wednesday makes you at once determined and uncertain \u2014 a holy place for sure. Beginnings and endings are all hap\u00ad pening on the same dime. A short vacation would be nice. TAURUS (Apr 20 - May 20): Yes. you can have it all, but not until you get a few financial bones cleaned up with those near and dear. Like who really owns what, and/or who really contributes the most. Recognize that higher power at the Full Moon on Wednesday, or you'll either burn the pot roast or feature expensive food poisoning. After that, sit in your favorite overstuffed and write poetry. GEMINI (May 21 - Jun 20): If you haven't been keeping a diary, then start Friday \u2014 if only to enable you to keep track of yourself. You'rebusy and events are pressing. Organize and try to avoid a work, health, finance syndrome that depletes. Because by Thursday you'll want to have the energy to celebrate. . .with a good night's sleep. Edit yourself at work. CANCER (Jun 21 - Jul 22): It's what relating Is all about \u2014 telling them what you want and getting it. Yes, crabs, you can all take the week off from walking sideways. Some of you will have brilliant insights and communicate them with your usual hesitant v ig o r...b u t this time you're right on. Romance? For sure. In mind, spirit and feeling, but cau\u00ad tion with the body parts. LEO (Jul 23 - Aug 22): Well, here's some of the commotion you've been waiting for. A career promise is a go, but the money is not what It should be. At the Full Moon on Wednesday, get the rest you need to facilitate an important work assignment. Health concerns at this time are possible due to you're not getting the strokes all Leos must have. Calculate your pace. VIRGO (Aug 23 - Sep 22): You're determined this week. Mentality is strong. Write something profound and delight and Inform your friends. The thing that matters most to you, your brain and Its bright and stimulating processes. Is sharper and more capable than ever. At home things need organizing and clarification.LIBRA (Sep 23 - Oct 22): You'll be wanting to know more this week, so buy at least two well-considered books. Magazines are amusing and the ads are informative \u2014 but this week \u2014 two books. You're very busy too this week as you set about to restructure home base. Your creative efforts need new imput. Nurture close relationships. SCORPIO (Oct 23 - Nov 21): Getting things the way you want them is an option this week. A fter the obligatory kvetching, you'll find your efforts put a child or a creative goal or a lover on the right track. Jupiter is in your 8th house where your needs are met in relation to others. The situations in this area are slowly improving. Yes, you love a parade. SAGITTARIUS (Nov 22 - Dec 21): Relations with others are making fresh progress, while relations with yourself can seem to be the same old, same old. There are last-minute finishing touches buffing up your Sun sign so that your future can function at greater optimum. That closet stuffed with guilt, fear and emotional lOUs is more organized at week's end \u2014 you feel a greater sense of self-worth. CAPRICORN (Dec 22 - Jan 19): Those \"things\" at work improve after a few last-minute squabbles. Your efforts are paying off. Everyone loves you \u2014 even the loan company. A new person or groupwill add to your esteem. Review money priorities with a partner. It's a good time to consider property in\u00ad vestments. After all, Capricorn Is the landlord. AQUARIUS (Jan 20 - Fob 18): Seems you suddenly realize that the money you've been spending on this and that and those really wasn't all that necessary; also in\u00ad cluded here are time and effort. You maneuver to get what you want, and you will as long as you can keep a secret. A parent or family problem could come to light. Clock your friends. PISCES (Feb 19 - Mar 20): You're the wettest of the wet, but this week you're on fire. Such dialogue from fresh fish. . . swimming upstream and slapping 'em back. Get paid. Get laid. Get published. Your voice coach is shrieking that you must be the new \u2014 and the best \u2014 Diva Marie Riva Della Casa. Some cau\u00ad tion Is advised \u2014 a cracked voice will put too much strain on the make-up.

The HIV virus attacks the immune system T-4 Helper Cells and as the number of T-4 cells decreases, the way is opened for the infections symptomatic of AIDS and ARC. Normal immune systems have between 500-1400 T-4 cells, but in most AIDS patients this level has dropped below 100. Many physicians who have worked with the HIV virus think that early treatment to prevent deterioration of the immune system (T-4 cells) is the best course of action to slow or stop the progression to AIDS. What is Positive Action treatment? Positive Action Healthcare is an outpatient program of preventive medicine attempting to maintain the health of your immune system (T-4 cells) at a level sufficient to ward off the onset of infections associated with AIDS. This treatment is not a cure for AIDS and is not in\u00ad tended for those whose immune systems have dete\u00ad riorated to the point of Al DS or ARC infections. Those requiring such treatment are referred to physicians providing this type of care. Whac the treatmeiit of? The specific treatment is developed between you and the Positive Action Healthcare physician based on the results of your initial physical examination. While each program is individualized, they all involve a combination of anti-viral medications to combat the HIV virus directly and immune boosters intended to strengthen your system. Positive Action personnel closely monitor potential new therapies. As the therapies show evidence of effectiveness, they will be added to the treatment, depending on patient needs.How effective is this treatment? Based upon the experience with Positive Action Healthcare patients (dating to 1984), results have been encouraging. Monitoring of T-4 helper cells indi\u00ad cates that this treatment offers promise in slowing or stopping the deterioration of the immune system. The summary of results of treatment with the Positive Action protocol are available to patients on a monthly basis. However, there is no guarantee of the treat\u00ad ment and it is too early to project long term results. What risks are entailed in the treatment? Every medical treatment has its risks. Some of the risks of the medications used in the treatment proto\u00ad cols are known; others are not yet so clearly defined. The physician treating you will carefully explain the known risks, before you decide to enter treatment, and will tell you of other potential dangers of the treatment that concern careful medical practitioners in the field of immunology. T'he P oskivii Aciiou The Positive Action Healthcare medical group is headed by Alan S. Levin, M.D., assisted by Vera S. Byers, M.D., Ph D. Dr. Levin and his wife. Dr. Byers, are both specialists in the research and treatment of problems of the immune system. They have published numerous medical and scientific documents in the field and both serve as Adjunct Associate Professors of Immu\u00ad nology at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. Since 1981, they have maintained a private practice in San Francisco in the field of allergy and immunology. In 1987, they established Positive Action Healthcare, a medical clinic devoted to the treatment of immune disorders related to the HIV virus.
