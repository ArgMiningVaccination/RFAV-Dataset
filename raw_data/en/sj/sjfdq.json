Changes in brain function during placebo lead - in and treatment outcomes in clinical trials for major depression. Am J Psychiat . 2006. 163. 1426 - 1432).Placebo effect - The expectations of the experimenter may alter trial results oUhlenhuth EH, Canter A, Neustadt JO, and Payson HE. The symptomatic relief of anxiety with meprobamate, phenobarbital, and placebo. Am J Psychiat. 1959; Patients were treated sequentially double- blind manner with placebo, meprobamate, and phenobarbital by two different psychiatrists. These two psychiatrists were chosen based on contrasting patterns on the Strong V ocational Interest Blank. Prior to beginning the study, psychiatrist A stated that he did not expect one agent to be more effective than another, whereas psychiatrist B stated that he expected some differences to appear, probably in favor of meprobamate. Based on a re-enactment of their method of instructing a patient, psychiatrist A's manner conveyed a noncommittal attitude, whereas psychiatrist B's manner conveyed a more hopeful attitude. The double blind experimental design was successful in that each psychiatrist was unable to accurately predict during the study which drug (placebo, meprobamate, or phenobarbital) each patient was taking. The results showed no significant differences between active drug and placebo with regard to the percentage of patients improved on active drug versus placebo for psychiatrist A, but showed that for psychiatrist B, significantly more patients improved on meprobamate than on placebo. Placebo effect - The expectations of the experimenter may alter trial results oSolvin GF. Psi expectancy effects in psychic healing studies with malarial mice. European Journal of Parapsychology . 1982. 4. 160- 197. Handlers of mice were deceived and told that some mice got low dose malaria injections and others got high dose injections, when in fact the malaria injections in both groups were equal. Mice believed by the handlers to have had high dose injections did worse.Levels of Evidence (Spilker B, ed. Guide to Clinical Trials . 1991. 530.

The dose was 500 mg/day in week one, 1000 mg/day in week two, 1500 mg/day in week four, and 2000 mg/day in week six. The data suggests this is most effective as an acute treatment option, with decreasing effectiveness as a long -term supplement (Brown ES et al. Am J Psych . Epub 2015).Addictive Disorders - evidence Magnesium -magnesium L -aspartate hydrochloride 732 weeks significantly decreased opioid use by 51% in opioid addicts ( J Addict Dis . 2003. 22. 49- 61.). Taurine 500- 2000 mg bid, especially to reduce withdrawal symptoms ( Lancet . 1977. 2. 509). Vitamin E with vitamin C to reduced opiate withdrawal symptoms -in an RCT, this combination reduced withdrawal symptoms in 57% as opposed to 7% in the placebo group ( In Vivo . 2000 Mar -Apr;14(2):363- 6).

Amongst the 27 who finished the trial, drug craving improved significantly in those randomized to NAC 2400 mg per day, but alcohol and drug use did not differ significantly. All patients received cognitive -behavioral therapy for substance use disorder (Back SE et al. J Clin Psychiatry . 2016. 77. E1439- e1446). oMechanism of action -glutamate receptor antagonist and increases in the nucleus accumbans of the brain; repletes glutathione and chronic narcotic use glutathione. oNOTE, is the compound in Mucomyst \u00ae administered via nebulizer, or as a liquid.Addictive Disorders - evidence - based treatments ( cont ) Vitamin C (buffered) high dose to reduce the symptoms of opiate withdrawal oHigh dose intravenous vitamin C beneficial in reducing symptoms of opiate withdrawal in a pilot trial (Libby AF, Stone I.

In his experience, most patients report benefit at a dose of 12 g/day, in which case it is not necessary to titrate to 18 g/day. oMechanism of action: Second messenger; enhances the sensitivity of serotonin receptors on the postsynaptic neurons oBEWARE those with low histamine levels may get worse. Zinc o100 mg zinc gluconate facilitated weight gain ( Int J Eat Disord . 1994. 15. 251- 255). oSummary of 4 RCTs and 2 open label trials on pages 112 -116 of Answers to Anorexia by James Greenblatt, MD (2010). oNote the yellow food dye tartrazine can cause zinc depletion by increasing urinary losses.Eating Disorders - evidence - based treatments ( cont ) Zinc carnosine -in a pilot 16 -week trial in which 22 patients with binge eating disorder (and 7 patients with bulimia) were given zinc carnosine 75 mg daily for 4 weeks, followed by 150 mg daily for 12 weeks, the mean number of binge eating days in the final four weeks of the trial was significantly lower than the mean number at baseline (70% lower, p < 0.001). All patients were on a stable dose of antidepressant at initiation of the trial. Note 150 mg per day of zinc carnosine provides 34 mg of zinc and 116 mg of carnosine. Note the mean serum zinc level at baseline was normal ( J Clin Psychopharmacol . 2020. 40. 599- 606).Insomnia - anecdotes Catnip tea at bedside for terminal insomnia -folk remedy, but no published human studies as per Varro Tyler, PhD. Chamomile tea Hemp Oil L-tryptophan -1 -2 gm 20- 30 min before bedtime, on an empty stomach. Lavender oil Lemon balm 400 mg at bedtime Passionflower 3 -8 grams as a tea or 350 mg of extract Progesterone 100 mg -off label 5-HTP 200- 400 mg at bedtime oNOTE if evening cortisol is high, 5- HTP at bedtime can cause worsening of insomnia (5- HTP may raise cortisol levels). oShown to improve sleep quality during stages 1, 4, and REM sleep, but no RCT data.Insomnia - evidence - based treatments Ashwagandha -member of the nightshade family oSystematic review reported benefit ( PLoS One. 9/24/21) oBeware of potential interaction with thyroid medication Cannabidiol (CBD) oil Beneficial in a case series of patients with Parkinson's Disease ( J Clin Pharm Ther. 2014. 39. 564- 566) Dosage is variable; 18- 24 mg daily is a reasonable starting dose Beware of potential herb -drug interactions via for GABA receptors oIn a one -month RCT of 32 men and women, those who received 150 mg of milk peptides reported 50% improvement in sleep quality and 30% less time to fall asleep ( The Open Sleep Journal . 2009. 2. 26- 32).Insomnia - evidence - based treatments ( cont ) Cherry juice (tart) -a dose of 240 ml in the morning and again one hour before bedtime of marginal benefit in a RCT of 11 individuals ( Am J Ther . 2018. 25. E194- e201). Glycine 3 gm hs ( Sleep and Biological Rhythms . 2006. 4. 75- 77). Safety good at doses as high as 30 gm/day ( J Nutr. 2004. 134. 1633S -1639S). Magnesium -250 mg twice a day of magnesium oxide beneficial in an 8- week RCT of 46 individuals with moderate or severe insomnia and a mean dietary magnesium intake of 194 mg magnesium per day, with an increase in mean sleep time (p=0.002) and sleep efficiency (p=0.03), as well as improvement in mean score on the Insomnia Severity Index (p=0.006) [ J Res Med Sci . 2012. 17. 1161- 1169].Insomnia - evidence - based treatments ( cont ) Melatonin -induces sleep (possibly by reducing body temperature) without changing sleep architecture. oA meta -analysis of 19 studies (N = 1683) concluded that those who took melatonin supplements fell asleep 7 minutes faster and increased overall sleep time by 8 minutes, with much individual variation in the response ( PLosOne. 2013). oBeware of variable quality -a 2017 study of 31 different over the counter melatonin preparations found that, when analyzed, the dosage of 71% of the products didn't match what was stated on the label. Melatonin content varied from 83% to +478% of labeled melatonin, and 70% had a melatonin concentration that was less than 10% of what was claimed ( J Clin Sleep Med . 2017; 13(2):163- 1650). oPhosphatidylserine 100 mg at dinner and 100 mg at bedtime for those with high salivary cortisol at bedtime and early morning awakening. Hypothesized mechanism of action -blunts stress -induced cortisol production, based on a data in a double -blind trial in young men subjected to exercise induced stress ( EurJ Clin Pharmacol . 1992. ( cont ) Valerian oValerian 530 mg twice a day beneficial in a 4 -week RCT of menopausal women ( Menopause . 2011. 18. 951- 955). oIn a one -month RCT of 100 postmenopausal women with sleep disturbance, those who received two capsules at bedtime, containing valerian 160 mg and lemon balm 80 mg showed improvement in quality of sleep ( Complement TherClin Pract. 2013. 19. 193- 196). oAcute insomnia - The evidence for a single dose effect is contradictory, but predominantly negative. A systematic review and meta -analysis reported lack of benefit for a hydroalcoholic extract, but with 2 of 3 studies reporting benefit with an aqueous extract ( Shinjyo N et al. J Evid Based Integr Med. 2020. 25. 25). oChronic insomnia - A systematic review and meta -analysis reported mixed findings ( Shinjyo N et al. J Evid Based Integr Med. 2020. 25. 25). oNOTE it may require several weeks of daily dosing to achieve a positive effect.OCD - anecdotes Amino Acids -free form oAMINOpowerplusTM-Truehope\u00ae oTotal Amino Acid solutionTM-GenesaTM oLithium orotate 5 -45 mg/day. Theory that low doses of lithium orotate are effective because lithium orotate more effectively crosses the blood brain barrier ( Agressologie . 1973. 14. 407- 411) and is more effectively absorbed into cells (rat data study -J Pharm Pharmacol .1978. 30. 368- extract) Taurine (inhibitory amino acid)OCD - evidence - based treatments Ashwagandha -effective in a pilot RCT ( Complement TherMed. 2016. 29). Nightshade, beware of interaction thyroid meds. EMPowerplusTM-36 ingredients; loading dose is 15 capsules per day and maintenance dose is 8 capsules per day. Cost of loading dose is $135/month. oBenefit seen in a within- subject crossover trail in an 18 year old with OCD and Asperger's Syndrome, when EMPowerplus was added to CBT J Anxiety Disord . 2009. 23. 836- 840). oBenefit seen in two case studies, within- subject crossover design, in one boy age 8 with atypical OCD, and second boy age 12 with pervasive developmental delay and explosive rage ( J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol . 2002. 12. 205- 219). oTheory to explain effectiveness of this multivitamin -formulated in a manner which somehow facilitates absorption in the GI tract and transport into the brain.OCD - evidence - based treatments ( cont ) NAC oBenefit of 600 mg bid reported in published case studies (Psychopharmacology . 2006. Jan. 254- 256), also in a published study of pathological gamblers (see Addictions section above). o2000 mg/day beneficial in a RCT of 41 patients with moderate to severe OCD, also treated with fluvoxamine 200 mg daily, based on a 10- week RCT of 44 patients ( J Clin Pharm 214-219). release of glutamate extrasynaptic space, which through a complex mechanism reduces synaptic release of glutamate. Saffron 15 mg twice a day -equally effective as Luvox in a RCT published in 10/17, as per Daniel Amen, MDOCD - evidence - based treatments ( cont ) 5-HTP oIn an RCT, 5 -HTP as adjuvant treatment for moderate to severe OCD, in combination with fluoxetine, was associated with greater reduction in symptoms down with fluoxetine alone ( Int Clin Psychopharmacology. 2020. 35. 254- 262). oJames Greenblatt, MD recommends starting at a dose of 50 mg, and titrating every 2 weeks to a maximum of 200 mg/day, and if in combination with SSRI, must be aware of the possibility for life -threatening serotonin syndrome.PTSD - anecdotes and unconventional pharmacologic therapy Amino Acids -free form MDMA (Ecstasy) assisted psychotherapy oBenefit reported in 6 Phase II trials as of 2018. oBeneficial in a phase 3 RCT of 90 people with severe PTSD, and a protocol of three 8 -hour sessions spaced one month apart. Two months after the final session, 675 in the treatment group no longer met criteria for PTSD, compared with 32% in the psychotherapy + placebo group (Mitchell JM. Nature Medicine . 2021).PTSD - evidence - based treatments Cannabis -no RCTs as of 2021, but in a prospective study (N=150) use of cannabis was associated with decreased PTSD symptoms over one year (p=0.02) . Participants who used cannabis were 2.57 times more likely to no longer meet DSM -V criteria for PTSD (Bonn- Miller et al. Cannabis . 2020). NAC -in an 8 -week RCT of 35 military veterans with PTSD and substance use disorder, amongst the 27 who finished the trial, mean severity of PTSD symptoms decreased to a greater extent in those randomized to NAC 2400 mg per day. All patients received cognitive - behavioral therapy for substance use disorder (Back SE et al. J Clin Psychiatry . 2016. 77. e1439 niacinamide) -Abram Hoffer, MD o3-6 grams daily (may increase to 30 -60 grams daily) oAs per clinical experience of Abram Hoffer, MD, use at least 1 gram three times a day for at least 5 years before judging this a treatment failure. oNiacin is not truly a vitamin; it is synthesized from tryptophan in humans, with 1.6% of tryptophan is converted to niacin. Hypothesized that this conversion is impaired in schizophrenics. oSupplementation may cause elevated transaminases, but this does NOT necessarily imply liver damage No need to discontinue unless AST or ALT > 3 times upper limit of normal IF LFTs are elevated, stop niacin for 5 days and repeat -if elevated LFTs are due to true liver damage, LFTs will still be elevated, but often with niacin LFTs normalize within a few days off niacin. Transaminases may be elevated secondary to methyl depletion, since niacin is a methyl acceptor -may be able to offset increases with 1.2 g lecithin bid or betaine.Schizophrenia - anecdotes ( cont ) Vitamin C -3-40 grams daily. Benefit may be attributable in part to depletion of histamine, a mediator of food allergies ( Brit J Psychiat . 1963. 109. 294- 299; Int J Neurosci . 1993. 68. 67- 71). There is data that schizophrenic patients can metabolize ten times more vitamin C than healthy people ( Int J Neuropsychiatry . 7/22/65; Biol Psychiatry 959- 966). Vitamin D 1000- 5000 IU/day (schizophrenia incidence is higher in areas in which vitamin D deficiency is common). GLA -numerous studies have shown that schizophrenics have low levels of omega 6 fats ( Biol Psychiatry . 1989. 25. 562- 30. 357- 362). Lithium orotate 5- 45 mg/day, or as little as 150- 500 mcg/day NADH 5 -10 mg/day Zinc 25- 100 mg dailySchizophrenia - evidence - based treatments Vitamin B6 25 mg, vitamin B9 2 mg and vitamin B12 400 micrograms daily beneficial in a RCT of highly symptomatic schizophrenics with a plasma homocysteine > 15 micromol/L, with a beneficial effect on positive and negative symptoms as well as 'general psychopathology' ( 15 mg ( Lancet . 1990. 336. 392 - 395) -especially useful in those with low histamine. In a study, 17 of 47 schizophrenics had low rbcfolate, and methylfolate supplementation produced significant reduction in symptoms compared to placebo (Godfrey et al. Lancet . 1990). Vitamin B12 ( J Neural Transm Gen Sect . 1994. 98. 143- 152) - especially useful in those with low histamine.Schizophrenia - evidence - based treatments ( cont ) Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) 100 mg daily beneficial in an open- label trial in 12 Brazilian patients with chronic schizophrenia who had been on stable doses of antipsychotic medication for at least a year ( J Clin Psychopharmacol . 2017. 37. 697- 701). Data from the 1950's suggests a therapeutic window such that a dose of 200 mg daily may cause deterioration. Ashwagandha -as an add -on treatment to antipsychotics for exacerbations, reduces negative symptoms general symptoms, and total symptoms, based on results of a RCT ( Chengappa KNR et with DHEA titrated up to 100 mg/day over 6 weeks, negative symptoms improved (p<0.001), and depression (p<0.05) and anxiety (p<0.001) diminished vs. no change in those on placebo. Hallucinations and delusions (positive symptoms) were unchanged in the treatment group. No adverse effects were experienced ( Arch Gen Psychiatry . 2003. 60. 133- 141).Schizophrenia on NMDA receptor and shown in small -scale clinical trials to reduce persistent negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia ( Primary Psychiatry . 2006. 13. 38- 46). agonist (interacts with glycine site on NMDA receptor) and shown in small -scale clinical trials to reduce persistent negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia ( Primary Psychiatry . 2006. 13. 38- 46). Dosage in trials was 30 mg/kg/day -D-Serine crosses the blood- brain barrier more easily than glycine, allowing a lower effective dose. In one RCT, D -serine 30 mg/kg/day added to antipsychotics significantly improved positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia (Biol Psychiatry. 1998. 44. 1081- 1089). In a meta -analysis 18 antipsychotics, treatment with glycine and D-serine moderately but significantly improved negative symptoms scores ( Schizophrenia Research . 2005. 72. 225- 234).Schizophrenia - evidence - based treatments ( cont ) Fish oil -conflicting data oIn a study of 20 chronic schizophrenics, 6 weeks of treatment with 10 grams per day of marine derived EPA led to significant improvements in negative symptoms ( Lipids . 1996. 31. S163- S165). oA Cochrane review concludes that there is no clear evidence of benefit ( Cochrane Database Syst Rev . 2006. CD001257). oIn a 26- week RCT of 71 patients hospitalized with first episode of schizophrenia, randomized to fish oil providing 2.2 grams daily of EPA +DHA versus olive oil control, the proportion of patients who had at least a 50% improvement in symptom severity was significantly greater in the fish oil group, 69.45% vs. 40.0%, p < 0.02 (J Psychiatr Res. 2016. 73. 34- 44).Schizophrenia - evidence - based ( cont for treatment of refractory schizophrenia -a 12-week RCT in China in which 56 patients received haloperidol plus 360 mg per day of standardized extract of ginkgo and 53 patients received haloperidol plus placebo showed that ginkgo increased the effectiveness of haloperidol and reduced its side effects ( J Clin Psychiat . 2001. 62. ) L-glycine - interacts with glycine site on NMDA receptor and shown in small-scale clinical trials to reduce persistent negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia ( Primary Psychiatry . 2006. 13. 38- 46). Dosage in trials was 15 -60 grams per day. In one RCT in patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia, 0.8 grams glycine/day (~60 gm/day) significantly reduced negative symptoms, and low -normal serum pre -treatment glycine predicted treatment response ( Arch General . 1999. 56. 29- 36). In a meta -analysis 18 double- antipsychotics, treatment with glycine and D-serine moderately but significantly improved negative symptoms scores ( Schizophrenia Research . 2005. 72. 225- 234). L-theanine -benefit seen at a dose of 400 mg per day in an 8 week RCT of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder for more than 2 years. Addition of L-theanine to antipsychotic medication associated with significant reductions in the PANSS positive and activation scores ( J Clin Psychiatry . 2011. 72. 34- 42).Schizophrenia - based treatments ( cont ) NAC -effective in chronic schizophrenia (average duration of 12 years) in a 6 -month RCT in 140 patients administered 1 gram bid. Significant improvements were noted for negative symptoms, global functioning and abnormal movements. \u00c5 qualitative review of the treatment effects identified the following patterns: the NAC group made gains in insight, self -care, social interaction, volition and stability of mood. ( Biological Psychiatry. 2008. 64. 361- 368). Theoretical basis is low glutathione levels in schizophrenic brain ( Neurobio Disease . 2006. 624- 632). NAC also receptor antagonist. Tardive Dyskinesia - anecdotes EMPowerplusTM Lecithin in a dose of 1- 2 tablespoons of granules per day Manganese 25 mg daily Melatonin 10 mg hs Tardive Dyskinesia - evidence - based treatment Ginkgo biloba (EGb761, 204 mg/day) beneficial in a RCT of 157 Chinese schizophrenic patients (J Clin Psychiatry . 2011. 72. based treatment ( cont ) Vitamin B6 1200 mg daily for 12 weeks, based on a 26 - week RCT in 50 inpatients ( J Clin Psychiatry . 2007. 68. 1648- 1654). In a study involving 89 schizophrenic inpatients -40 with tardive dyskinesia and 49 without any symptoms of motor disturbances, plasma pyridoxal - 5-phosphate (PLP) levels (an indicator of vitamin B6 status) were found to be significantly lower in the with tardive dyskinesia daily for at least 3 months ( Ann Clin . 1998. 863 -867 and 868 -872).Trichotillomania -evidence -based treatment NAC 600 mg bid for 6 weeks, followed by 1200 mg bid for 6 weeks in those with persistent symptoms associated with a significant improvement in hair pulling (p<0.001) in a RCT in 45 women and 5 men. 56% of patients in the treatment group reported \"much improved.\" NOTE it took 9 weeks on average to see a response. Proposed mechanism -restoration of extracellular glutamate ( Arch Gen Psychiatry . 2009. 66. 756- 763). Scott Shannon, MD, integrative medicine psychiatrist, in an unpublished summary of positive trials of NAC (across a wide spectrum of psychiatric conditions) \"This broad spectrum of response appears with omega 3 essential fatty acids also. Given that our diagnostic system in psychiatry grows from the observed symptoms, this trend of treatments (conventional as well as non- conventional) to show broad efficacy most likely points out the real limitations of how we classify problems in psychiatry. It may be that common physiological issues (such as inflammation) form the insidious core of many psychiatric illnesses that may arise with quite varied symptom patterns based on individual vulnerability. Efforts to identify and treat core metabolic abnormalities may represent a potential new direction for psychiatry that moves us away from mere symptom management of severe psychiatric illness.\"Dietary supplement quality Variable due to insufficient funds such that FDA spot checks are infrequent. Historically, with Congressional passage of DSHEA legislation in 1994, there were significant regulatory gaps, but since approximately 2010 the regulations are considered sufficient by many experts.Dietary supplement quality (cont) www.consumerlab.com lists good and bad quality brands for a variety of popular supplements, for a small annual subscription cost NSF, NPA, USP Verified, and tGA are organizations which certify manufacturing companies for cGMP.
