Carrier ABSTRACT: One of the most heated discussions in economics in recent years has concerned the relationship between market structure and innovation. After a half-century of debate and innumerable studies, the consensus is that there is no clear answer to the question. On a concrete level, the uncertainty underlies the most fundamental critique of \"innovation markets,\" or markets for research and development (\"R&D\"). After all, if concentration leads to inno vation, then antitrust challenges are not appropriate even for mergers that lead to monopoly. In this Article, I closely parse the economic studies to arrive at a more nuanced answer that highlights fact ors determining the ideal market structure for innovation. I show that bo th competition and size play a role in pharmaceutical innovation. In addition, analysis of the pharmaceutical industry rebuts the most cogent critiques of innovation markets. The Article also includes the first em pirical analysis of pharmaceutical innovation-market cases. This is par ticularly instructive because nearly every challenge to innovation-market mergers has arisen in the pharmaceutical industry. For each of the nine cases, I examine the pre- merger treatment for particular conditions , the number of participants in the market and stage of FDA review, and the current market picture. I conclude that approximately half the agen cy challenges were justified. Finally, I propose a new test to appl y to innovation markets. The test examines (1) concentration among firm s reasonably likely to reach the market, (2) anticompetitive theories of innovation suppression, and Professor, Rutgers University School of Law-Camden.

After a half-century of debate and innumerable studies, the overwhelming consensus is that there is no clear answer to the question. The diametrically opposed positions of Joseph Schumpeter (favoring concentration) and Kenneth Arrow (favoring co mpetition) both garner support in unending bouts of hand-wringing. This Article offers at least a partial solution to this puzzle. By closely parsing the economic studies, I isolat e several factors that determine the ideal market structure for innovation in specific industries. In particular, I find that competition an d size are each important for pharmaceutical innovation. This nuanced approach promises to pay dividends in the context of \"innovation markets,\" one of the most criticized concepts in antitrust law. Such markets are unique in that they consist not of actual products, but of the research and development (\"R&D\" ) directed toward new products. Perhaps because of their novelty, cr itics have leveled numerous attacks against such markets: 1 Innovation is speculative and includes unidentifiable market participants; Innovation markets are not needed because conduct can be challenged at a later time; The relationship between R&D and innovation is unclear; and The market structure most conducive to innovation is unclear. The approach I offer in this Article addresses these concerns. It also promises to have immediate practical consequences. The antitrust enforcement agencies, for example, have recently been hamstrung by disagreement on innovation markets. In the proposed 2004 merger between Genzyme and Novazyme, the two companies researching Pompe disease (a fatal condition affecting young childr en), the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") split 3-1-1 on the question of whether to challenge the merger. In a statement accompanying the majority decision not to challenge the merger, Chairman Timothy Muris refu sed to would constitute a major step backward in antitrust law.\" 2 In contrast, 1. See infra Part I.B. 2. Statement of Chairman Timothy J. Muris, In the Matter of Genzyme Corporation/Novazyme Pharmaceuticals, In c. 25 (Jan. 13, 2004) [hereinafter Muris Statement], available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2004/01/murisgenzymestmt.pdf. 397 CARRIER _TRANSMITTED 10:36 AM TWO PUZZLES RESOLVED Commissioner Mozelle Thompson's dissent highlighted the dangers of a merger to monopoly.3 The common-sense concern about a merger between the two most advanced firms in a market explains not only the dissent in the Genzyme case, but also the FTC's eight challenges to mergers (all since 1990) in innovation markets in the pharmaceutical indust ry. Common sense, however, is not economic foundation, particularly wh en the relationship between market structure and innovation is as disputed as it is. This Article at last offers the economic foundation that has been missing from innovation-market analysis. Part I begins by defining innovation markets. It then articulates the most fundamental critiques that have been leveled against the markets. Finally, it rebuts these critiques by emphasizing the realities of the pharmaceutical industry. It explains that The high barriers to entry from pa tents and a lengthy Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") regulatory process allow the relevant innovators to be identified; The conduct cannot be challenged at a later time because it is difficult, if not impossible, to obse rve a lack of innovation in the product market; and The question of which market structure is most conducive to innovation can be answered in the pharmaceutical industry. Part II then focuses on the crucial inquiry involving market structure and innovation. It first articulates th e positions of Schu mpeter and Arrow. Next, it extracts the most important fa ctors from the economic studies in the past half-century. Applying these factor s, this Part finds that the resources needed to survive the lengthy FDA regulatory process demonstrate the importance of size in the industry. But the presence of patents, product innovation, and technological opportunity shows the significance of competition for pharmaceutical inno vation. This finding confirms the propriety of antitrust enforcement in innovation markets. Part III proposes a new five-part te st for the agencies to apply to innovation markets. First, the agenci es must show that the merger would lead to significant concentration among firms reasonably likely to reach the market. Second, they must offer a th eory that the merging firms will suppress innovation. Third, the firms can rebut the prima facie case of concentration by showing that another firm is likely to reach the market. 3. Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Mozelle W. Thompson In the Matter of Genzyme Corporation/Novazyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1 (J an. 13, 2004) [hereinafter Thompson Statement], available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2004/01/thompsongenzymestmt. pdf. CARRIER _TRANSMITTED .DOC 2/26/2008 9:55 AM 398 93 IOWA LAW REVIEW [2008] Fourth, in a narrow range of cases, the merging firm s can proffer an efficiencies defense. Fifth, a \"Schum peterian\" defense can be offered by small firms that would not otherwise be able to navigate the regulatory process. The test improves upon the current analysis in several ways. It replaces the current ad hoc approach with a comprehensive framework based on the Merger Guidelines. And it breaks new ground in considering not just the number of firms in R&D, but also th eir respective stages of FDA review. Given the wildly varying odds of success in reaching the market from the preclinical stage and each of the clinical stages, it is indefensible to continue to neglect this factor. Part IV presents the results of ni ne case studies from the past two decades\u2014eight cases challenged and one not challenged by the FTC. These cases are important because they consti tute nearly all of the innovation- market cases. In fact, there have been only two challenges outside this arena.4 In addition, because these matters have all been settled by consent decree, (1) the relevant analysis has taken place not in the courts but in the agencies, and (2) discussion about the ca ses has, until now, been limited to the facts alleged in the agency complaints. My empirical analysis examines the treatment of particular conditions before the merger, the number of participants, the merging firms' (and rivals') stage of FDA review, and the state of the market today. It concludes that five of the nine cases were justif ied but that the rema ining four should not have been challenged. Going forward, application of my te s t p r o m i s e s t o m a k e i n n o v a t i o n - market analysis more comprehensive and predictable and to incorporate a more realistic assessmen t of pharmaceutical development hurdles. By preventing unnecessary challenges, it seeks to ensure the most effective use of limited government resources. And by increasing the odds that certain products will reach the market, it promises to promote innovation. In short, the debates concerning innovation markets and the relationship between market structure and innovation present some of the most challenging issues in economics and antitrust. By closely parsing the economic studies and conducting the fi rst empirical analysis of innovation- market mergers in the pharmaceutical in dustry, this Article begins to solve two crucial, interrelated puzzles. I. I NNOVATION MARKETS A. THEORY The concept of innovation markets burst into attention (at least of scholars and the government agencies) in 1995. In that year, the antitrust 4. See infra notes 191-92 and accompanying text (describing the two challenges). 399 CARRIER _TRANSMITTED .DOC 2/26/2008 9:55 AM TWO PUZZLES RESOLVED enforcement agencies\u2014the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") and FTC\u2014 promulgated Intellectual Property (\"IP\") Guidelines. The most controversial aspect of the Guidelines was the creati on of an innovation market, which was defined as A[] . . . market [that] consists of the research and development directed to particular new or improved goods or processes, and the close substitutes for that research and development. 5 \"The close substitutes,\" the Guidelines continued, were \"research and development efforts, technologies, and goods that significantly constrain the exercise of market power with respect to the relevant research and development . . . .\" 6 The agencies promised that they would \"delineate an innovation market only when the capabilities to engage in the relevant research and development [c ould] be associated with specialized assets or characteristics of specific firms.\"7 The theory behind innovation markets is that a merger between the only two (or two of a few) firms in R&D might increase the incentive to suppress at least one of the research paths. With no other firms ready to enter the market, the merging firms mi ght not wish to introduce a second product that would reduce sales of the fi rst. Moreover, such activity can only be challenged at the R&D stage. Wait ing until products appear (or, more likely, fail to appear) in the marketplace is not an effective option. This concern is heightened given th e importance of innovation to the growth of the U.S. economy. Every study in the past fifty years has shown that innovation is far more important than any other economic efficiency in fostering growth. 8 Given the difficulty of meas uring innovation, allegations of harm must be considered cautiously. But because innovation is so crucial, we cannot ignore activity that can only be addressed in R&D markets. To be sure, in most of the cases challenged by the agencies, innovation markets do not play a role. But desp ite the small number of innovation- market cases, critics have vociferously disparaged the concept. B. C RITIQUES Critics have leveled four central atta cks against innovation markets: (1) the process of innovation is speculativ e and does not allow all of the market participants to be identified; (2) we do not know the optimal relationship 5.

CARRIER _TRANSMITTED .DOC 2/26/2008 9:55 AM 400 93 IOWA LAW REVIEW [2008] between R&D and innovation; (3) innovation markets are not needed because conduct can be challenged at a later time; and (4) we do not know the market structure most conducive to innovation. First, innovation is speculative. I t i s \" i n t a n g i b l e , u n c e r t a i n , unmeasurable, and often even unobservable, except in retrospect.\"9 As a result, it is exceedingly difficult to id entify all of the firms that are in a particular innovation market. As Dennis Carlton and Robert Gertner explain, \"[B]ecause the results of R&D ar e so difficult to predict, the analyst may be unable to determine all, or even most, of the relevant firms who might produce competitive products in the future.\" 10 The authors offer several anecdotes showing the unpredicta bility of the sources of innovation: Experiments on refrigerator gases, which led to the discovery of Teflon; Research on wound dressings, which led to the discovery of a breathable, waterproof fabric; and A machine developed to analyze brain chemistry, which now identifies the components of fruit juices.11 Second, \"the optimal amount of R&D is unknown.\"12 More R&D does not necessarily result in more innova tion. \"[A] merger that reduces R&D exp en d it ur e ma y b e b en ef icia l if it a ll o ws t h e R &D t o b e con duct ed m or e efficiently.\"13 Because competing R&D expenditures might be duplicative, \"a merger that eliminates redundancy may lead to the same knowledge produced at lower costs, or even to greater knowledge at lower costs.\"14 Third, innovation-market analysis is unnecessary because the relevant conduct can be challenged at a later stage. It can be challenged at the product-market stage, where we can identify the products and their characteristics. Or it can be challenged at the \"potential competition\" stage, where at least one firm is on the market and another is about to enter the market. 15 Based on the existence of a potential-competition theory, some have found it \"difficult to see\"16 what innovation markets add, while others 9.

As two of numerous commentators explain, \"[N]either theory nor empirical work provides [sic] any general justification for an antitrust merger policy aimed at preserving competition in R&D markets,\"19 and \"[t]he connection between market structure and innovation has been debated by economists for decades without resolution.\"20 C. REBUTTAL There is an element of truth in each o f t h e f o u r c r i t i q u e s . I n m a n y cases, we do not know all of the potential innovators or the optimal relationship between R&D and innovati on. For that reason, an expansive notion of the innovation-market conc ept is not appropriate. But a narrow version, applied to the pharmaceutical industry, withstands the critiques. First, in the pharmaceutical industry, innovation is not speculative or carried out by unknown innovators. The barriers to entry provided by patents and, especially, a lengthy regu latory process cabin the universe of potential innovators. Unlike other industries, there are no \"garage inventors\" that will spring up out of nowhere to create a pharmaceutical product. Because the regulatory process requires a lengthy and costly period of drug discovery, preclinical testing, and clinical trials, an entrant would not be able to \"leap-frog\" into the market.21 Rather, it would be required to engage in years of testing before catching up to current R&D efforts.22 The pharmaceutical industry therefore meets the requirement articulated in the IP Guidelines that \"the capabilities to engage in the relevant [R&D] can be associated with sp ecialized assets or characteristics of specific firms.\"23 In addition, cooperation betw een the FDA and the antitrust agencies has ensured \"a wealth of in formation on the status, approach, and likely effect of each innovation effort.\" 24 Second, we know that higher amounts of R&D benefit innovation. Pharmaceutical R&D typically does no t suffer from the duplication that 17. Rapp, supra note 9, at 20. 18. Lawrence B.

As on e commentator notes, \"[I]dentical research tracks and matched future efficacy are unlikely.\"25 E v e n i f t e n companies test drugs for a particular type of cancer, for example, the projects \"are likely to involve different research teams, different concepts, ideas, and directions, different co rporate cultures, and other factors affecting the likelihood and degree of eventual success.\"26 Contributing to the absence of duplic ation, there is a large number of spillovers in the pharmaceutical industry. The industry is marked by high publication rates, and scientists are aware of and influenced by rivals' discoveries.27 Spillovers have only increased in recent years with the more frequent use of \"rational drug design ,\" which anticipates working backward from knowledge of a disease's biochemistry.28 Third, innovation-market analysis prom ises to target activity that could not otherwise be challenged at a later time. Granted, particular mergers may have effects on markets with actual or potential competition. But other activity will remain outside the reach of antitrust. Such a flaw is particularly concerning because the restriction of innovation would appear only as a \"non-event.\"29 In other words, it will not be apparent after the fact what is missing from the marketplace. We cannot observe the absence of innovation like we can observe higher prices. This is especially worrisome because, as discussed above,30 research paths in the pharmaceutical industry generally are not duplicative and the innovations are so critical to public health. Moreover, any harms to innovation cannot easily be remedied after the merger has occurred, the research line has been suppressed, and employees have taken on new projects. Fourth, we can ascertain the market structure most conducive to innovation. Although size is important in the regulatory process, Part II will demonstrate the crucial role that co mpetition plays in pharmaceutical innovation. A close parsing of the econ omic studies and application to the industry disproves the prospect that on ly a monopolistic market structure promotes innovation in the industry. 25.

M ARKETS , INNOVATION , AND DRUGS The question of the market structure most conducive to innovation traces back sixty years to the debate between Schumpeter and Arrow. This Part first articulates the two economis ts' theories. It then discusses more recent studies and extracts the most important factors determining an industry's ideal market structure. It co ncludes by applying these factors to the pharmaceutical industry. A. SCHUMPETER AND ARROW Joseph Schumpeter famously highlighted the role played by concentration in promoting innova tion. He explained that perfect competition (a model in which producer s lack market power) was \"inferior in internal, especially technological, efficiency.\"31 The perfectly competitive firm \"wastes opportunities\" and, because it is less able to develop and evaluate new possibilities, \"waste[s] capital.\"32 For that reason, \"perfect competition is and always has been temporarily suspended whenever anything new is being introduced.\" 33 Monopoly, in contrast, affords protection \"against temporary disorganization of the market\" an d secures space \"f or long-range planning.\"34 Monopoly offers \"superior methods,\" such as experience and financial resources, that are no t available to competitive firms.35 It also provides for the \"insuring or hedging\" activities needed for investment.36 In fact, the monopolist only can realize its most innovative plans because it is not subject to competition from \"heavy capital requirements or lack of experience.\"37 In the end, concludes that \"the large-scale establishment . . . . . the output.\"38 Some Schumpeter's arguments\u2014su ch as the protection against the \"disorganization of the market\"39\u2014envision monopoly. But in several places, the theorist discusses the \"large scale unit of control\"40 and advances arguments for which size, not monopoly , is sufficient. For example, he 31. JOSEPH A.

CARRIER _TRANSMITTED .DOC 2/26/2008 9:55 AM 404 93 IOWA LAW REVIEW [2008] highlights experience, financia l resources, and \"heavy capital requirements\"41 as essential ingred ients for innovation. In contrast, Kenneth Arrow demonstrat ed that \"the incentive to invent is less under monopolistic than under competitive conditions.\"42 Unlike the monopolist, for which some of the prof its from the new invention come at the expense of the old technology, the competitor receives all of the returns from a new invention.43 This conclusion applies with particular force to drastic innovations for which the post-i nvention monopoly price is less than the pre-invention monopolist's costs.44 In such a case (in which the old technology is rendered obsolete), the monopolist has \"a strong disincentive for further innovation.\"45 The same conclusion holds for a nondrastic innovation. In this scenario, the post-invention monopoly price exceeds the pre-invention costs.46 The conclusion here is more subtle because the competitor's profits from the new technology are \"limited by competition with the former monopolist's old technology.\"47 But because of the declining demand curve, the monopolist's incentive is \"less than the cost reduction on the postinvention monopoly output.\"48 And because this cost reduction is le ss than the competitive output, the competitor's incentive exceeds that of the monopolist.49 B. T HE STUDIES Economists have conducted countless studies in the past half-century to resolve the market structure-innovation puzzle addressed by Schumpeter and Arrow. This Section examines four of the most critical factors that determine the ideal market structure for innovation in particular industries. Two factors apply to all markets: (1 ) the distinction between product and process innovation and (2) the distinction between drastic and nondrastic innovation. And two focus on characteristics of particular industries: (3) technological opportunity and (4) appropriability. One of the most fundamental flaws of the studies is that they do not control for the effect of the factors. In other words, conclusions about 41. SCHUMPETER , supra note 31, at 89. 42. KENNETH J.

Product or Process Whether a firm engages in product or process innovation is one of the most important factors determining market structure. Firms typically market product innovations externally and use process innovations internally.51 Of the two, product-related R&D more often produces patentable innovations.52 The patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling any product embodying the patent. 53 This right also allows the patentee to license the patent. 54 Firms of all sizes are more likely to appropriate their investment in product R&D by exploiting their patents. In contrast, process innovations are not as likely to be patented. These innovations are more difficult to define and enforce 55 and are easier to invent around.56 In addition, secrecy is more effective for processes, which are more easily concealed and which may disclose useful business information to competitors. 57 But if processes are not patented, firms need to rely on other mechanisms, such as size, to appropriate their investments. In many cases, monopoly power is just such a mechanism, substituting for legal property rights and preventing misappropriation.58 50. For a typical recounting of other flaws, see Jonathan B.

Monopo ly also may allow a firm to reduce its monitoring costs or to slow the entry of competitors into the industry, both of which encourage research activity.59 Relatedly, process innovations allow firms to lower their producti on costs, which could increase concentration.60 Many of the economic studies undertaken in the past fifty years have focused on process innovations.61 Such a focus is larg ely responsible for the widespread conclusion that concentration is linked with innovation.62 A careful parsing, then, of the presence of product or process innovations is crucial to determine the role of ma rket structure in innovation. At a minimum, concentration enhances firms' abilities to appropriate process innovations much more th an product innovations. 63 2. Drastic or Nondrastic A second factor underlying the link between market structure and innovation is the presence of drasti c or nondrastic innovation. A drastic product innovation is \"one that is so superior to existing products in cost or functionality that existing products are not competitive.\"64 A drastic process innovation lowers the marginal cost of production by such an extent that firms using a pre-existing process cannot compete with the innovator.65 Nondrastic innovations, in contrast, ty pically allow use of both the original and new product or process.66 For drastic innovations, competition is superior to monopoly. A monopolist is less likely to introduce a new product that will displace the 59. Lunn, supra no te 5 4 , a t 4 26 .

A competitive firm, in contrast, will gain the full benefit of a new drastic innovation without suffering any losses from reduced sales in the prior product. 68 Jennifer Reinganum has shown that, in the context of drastic innovation, challengers have a greater incentive to invest than monopolists. She demonstrates that if both firms invest marginally less in the new innovation, the monopolist still would receive the revenue flow from its current product, while the challenger would not. 69 As a result, the challenger would be likely to invest more resources in R&D. Reinganum achieves similar results when considering a sequence of drastic innovations. In that scenario, the length of the current product stage is affected by the monopolist's investment in that stage.70 The monopolist invests less than the challenger since increased investment shortens the current stage by hastening the discovery of the next innovation. 71 But the monopolist, of course, has \"less incentive to shorten the length of its current-stage incumbency.\"72 In contrast, with complementary nondrastic innovations, the old product will not be displaced.73 The monopolist then will have at least as much incentive as the challenger to in vest in R&D. In fact, the monopolist may have greater incentive because, th rough nondrastic innovations, it can \"maintain[] its monopoly profits,\" as compared to an entrant, who \"gains only a share of duopoly profits.\"74 This conclusion is strengthened in a model in which a patent is awarded to the highest bidder. In that case, the monopolist may have an incentive to preempt R&D competition by bidding more for a patent than a competitor could invest. 75 In short, the more the innovation offers a drastic improvement over the previous product, the greater incentive the challenger has to invest in R&D and the less incentive the monopolist has to displace its present monopoly. The characteristics described in this and the previous Sections explain the results of many of the economic studies. Further elucidation comes from 67.

In particular, the factors of technological opportunity and appropriability explai n much of the variance in market structures.76 Technological opportunity \"determines the productivity of R&D,\" while appropriability \"determines the fraction of the returns from R&D that the innovator is able to retain.\" 77 The relationship between technological opportunity and appropriability, on the one hand, and in novation, on the other, is complex. One difficulty is that the variables are endogenous to market structure. In other words, the variables not only affect innovation, but also are affected by innovation. To the extent, nonetheless, that the two affect market structure, they weaken the link between market structure and innovation. Industries characterized by technological opportunity and high appropriability generally do not ne ed monopoly to encourage innovation. 3. Technological Opportunity Economists have offered several definitions of technological opportunity. One typical definition is \" t h e r a t e a t w h i c h m o r e o r l e s s exogenous and cumulative advances in science and technology generate profitable new innovative possibilities.\" 78 Technological opportunity varies by industry.79 Industries with rapid changes in scientific knowledge face lower costs of producing innovative output.80 The greater the technological opportunity, the greater the incentive to engage in R&D and reap the benefits of innovation. Conversely, a slowly advancing and predictable science base could lead to \"excessive rivalry\" because of fewer opportun ities to appropriate investments.81 While there is no single formula encapsulating technological development, a Yale University study articulated three sources of contributions to an industry's technological opportunities: (1) the advance of scientific knowledge, (2) \"technol ogical advances in other industries,\" and (3) \"positive feedback[]\" (and future opportunities) from technological 76.

Appropriability Appropriability signifies a firm's ab ility to recover its investment. Not surprisingly, a firm's incentive to invest in R&D increases as appropriability increases.88 In industries characterized by high appropriability, there is less need for monopoly to recover investment. Much of the discussion about product and process innovation applies to appropriability. For example, appropriab ility typically is high for firms that patent product innovations. In contra st, reduced appropriability, as more often occurs with process innovations, leads to a need for size to prevent misappropriation. 89 The higher the appropriability, therefore, the more attenuated the connection between size and innovation. Appropriability varies based on in dustry. The influential 1987 \"Levin\" study found that certain industries, such as food processing and metal\u00ad 82.

But the concept also can apply to activity before this time. If hurdles such as an extensive regulatory process or a need for significant capital prevent a firm from reaching the market, then the firm will not even have an opportunity to reach the market to reap rewards. Pre-innovation appropriability, even if it is less apparent than its post- innovation counterpart, thus is an important factor in the analysis. * * * In short, myriad conflicting econ omic studies have built on the Schumpeter-Arrow debate. As this Sect ion has shown, a close parsing of those studies reveals that four factors determine the ideal market structure in particular settings. One context that has been highly disputed\u2014but until now bereft of connection to the economic studies\u2014is that of innovation markets in the pharmaceutical industry. If application of the four factors shows that size is crucial for pharmaceutical innovation, then mergers in innovation markets might not present concern. If, on th e other hand, competition plays an important role, then challenges to innovation-market mergers would be justifiable. C. A PPLICATION The pharmaceutical industry demo nstrates the importance of both competition and size. Most of the fact ors highlighted in the last Section reveal the benefits of competitio n for pharmaceutical products. The industry is characterized by produc t innovation, high post-innovation appropriability, and high technological op portunity. But size plays a role in pre-innovation appropriability by allowing firms to survive a lengthy, expensive FDA regulatory process.92 90. Richard C. Levin et al., Appropriating the Returns from Industrial Research and Development , 1987 B ROOKINGS PAPERS ON ECON. ACTIVITY 783, 802. 91. Id. at 794. 92. In most of the challenged innovation-market cases, the factor of drastic or non-drastic innovation does not directly apply because neither of the merging firms had a monopoly in the market for the previous product. 411 CARRIER _TRANSMITTED .DOC 2/26/2008 9:55 AM TWO PUZZLES RESOLVED 1. Product or Process Pharmaceutical companies devote approximately seventy-five percent of R&D to product innovation.93 Of even more relevance for our purposes, all of the innovation-market mergers challe nged by the FTC involved products. The nine mergers involved (1) a prophy lactic herpes vaccine, (2) a rotavirus vaccine, (3) CD-4 based therapeutics used in treating HIV/AIDS, (4) EGFR inhibitors used to treat solid cancerous tumors, (5) enzyme replacement therapies for Pompe disease, (6) fibrin sealants, (7) gene therapy, (8) a noninjectable migraine treatment, an d (9) topoisomerase I inhibitors for colorectal cancer. 94 As shown above, concentration has a much greater effect in encouraging process than product innovations. Because all of the challenged pharmaceutical innovation-market mergers involved products, the first factor counsels in favor of competition promoting innovation. 2. Drastic or Nondrastic For the majority of the mergers, the distinction between drastic and nondrastic innovation does not apply. In five of the nine cases, there was no related product on the market, 95 and in two others,96 a rival of the merging firms offered a nondrastic but competitive innovation. Only in two cases did one of the merging companies have a product on a related market. In one, Glaxo had an injectable treatment for migraine headaches that could have been affected by the introduction of a noninjectable migraine treatment bein g researched by merging firms Glaxo and Wellcome. 97 In the second case, Glaxo Wellcome had a suppressive herpes drug that could have been affected by a prophylactic herpes vaccine being researched by Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKlineBeecham. 98 Both R&D efforts constituted primarily drastic innovation though they also contained elements of nondrastic innovation. First, because patients naturally preferred oral to injectable delivery, a noninjectable migraine treatment did in fact displace much of the need for injectable treatment. 93.

CARRIER _TRANSMITTED .DOC 2/26/2008 9:55 AM 412 93 IOWA LAW REVIEW [2008] But because only injectable treatment worked with certain types of migraines, there was still a need for the old technology.99 Similarly, the herpes vaccine largely represented a drastic innovation. Patients who had not contracted the disease would no longer need suppressive treatment after receiving the vaccine. But patients who already had contracted herpes still required the suppressive treatment, thus demonstrating a nondrastic element. 100 For most of the pharmaceutical innova tion-market cases, this factor will not apply. But where it does apply, and where the innovation is drastic, it is more likely that firms will suppress R& D paths. In these cases, competition would best promote innovation. 3. Technological Opportunity The pharmaceutical industry is ch aracterized by high technological opportunity and significant R&D. 101 Applying the construct described abov e, the first variable explaining technological opportunity is the proxim ity of the industry to science. The pharmaceutical industry is one of th e most closely linked industries to science. The Levin study, based on a survey of high-level R&D managers, concluded that pharmaceuticals were the industry most linked to a particular science. 102 The sciences of biology and chemistry were closely connected to drugs (scoring at least si x-and-a-half on a seven-point scale of relevance).103 Another study demonstrated a close link between science and the pharmaceutical industry by analyz ing the percentage of basic research spending of the total industry R&D spending.104 The other two variables also de monstrate high technological opportunity. First, institutions ot her than private drug companies\u2014in particular, universities and government laboratories\u2014contribute to technical knowledge.105 Second, there is positive feedback from technological advances, as improving product performance continually spurs innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. In short, high technological opportun ity in the pharmaceutical industry demonstrates the importance of competition. 99. See infra note 235 and accompanying text. 100.

Appropriability Application of the appropriability factor leads to mixed results in the pharmaceutical industry. Before reachi ng the market, size is necessary to survive the FDA regulatory process, which demonstrates low appropriability. But after the drug is on the market, appropriability is high, as evidenced by the unique importance of patents in the industry. Companies need size to surmount the hurdles of the FDA regulatory process. As described in more detail be low, the process is lengthy, composed of preclinical testing and three stages of human clinical trials.106 Large firms are more likely to have the resources\u2014in particular, economies of scale,107 regulatory expertise,108 and access to internal funding109\u2014to survive this gauntlet. Such firms, for example, have the resources to conduct expensive Phase III clinical trials involving thousands of subjects.110 In contrast, small biotechnology companies, even if they can discover compounds and engage in preclinical and early clinical studies, lack the size and resources to go further. They therefore tend to collaborate or merge with larger firms to continue the discovery into large-scale trials. 111 Even the patents that smaller firms may receive du ring trials do not replace the need for size in surmounting the high regulatory hurdles. But after the innovation reaches the market, the industry is marked by high appropriability. Numerous studie s are consistent in concluding that Product and process patents are most effective in the pharmaceutical industry;112 Patents are more effective in the pharmaceutical industry than in almost every other industry;113 More than two-thirds of pharmaceutical R&D in Great Britain in 1968 depended on patent protection;114 and 106.

Further increasi ng appropriability, patents raise the costs of imitation in the industry by thirty to forty percent.117 The discrete nature of innovation e nhances appropriabil ity. In contrast to complex technologies, which are composed of nu merous patented inputs, new drugs contain a \"discrete nu mber of patentable elements.\"118 The effectiveness of patents in the industry ensures appropriability through commercialization or licensing. 119 In short, in the pharmaceutical industry, size is important before the innovation reaches the market but, beca use of the effectiveness of patents, less crucial after that point. * * * Most of the factors critical to economists' conclusions demonstrate the significance of competit ion in the pharmaceutical industry. We thus can conclusively rebut the contention that only a concentrated market structure could maximize pharmaceutical innovation. 120 To be sure, the need for size in the regulatory process requires that this characteristic be considered in the analysis. But competition's vital role confirms the propriety of enforcement in pharmaceutical innovation markets. In fact, given that mergers between the two firms closest to the market threaten competition as much as any of the firms' activities, antitrust enforcement is essential for pharmaceutical innovation. 114.

To be sure, research spillovers in the pharmaceutical industry could weaken appropriability.

T HE NEW TEST The agencies currently engage in an incomplete, ad hoc analysis when conducting pharmaceutical innovati on-market analysis. Although they emphasize competition, they do not promote the effective competition that would most directly offer the innovation benefits described in the previous Section. In particular, the agencies do not co nsider the difficulty of bringing a drug to market or the likelihood that the merging firms (or others) will be successful in reaching the market. They also do not consider entry, efficiency, or Schumpeterian defenses that arise out of pharmaceutical innovation and the FDA regulatory process. This truncated analysis is harmful, as it justifies unnecessary merger challenges that drain finite resources. With a full plate of antitrust (and, for the FTC, consumer protection) issues, unnecessary merger challenges block more-necessary enforcement. And the hazards increase when the agencies challenge mergers that promise to increase the odds of a treatment reaching the market. In this Part, I offer a new test for the agencies to apply to pharmaceutical innovation-market merger s. The test builds on the insights of the first two Parts of the Article and incorporates a realistic assessment of the hurdles of pharmaceutical development. The goal of the test is to preserve R&D competition where it is mo st likely to contribute to innovation but most in danger of being suppressed. This competition occurs in the stages of regulatory approval closest to the marketplace. The five-part analysis I offer is based on the framework of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines. The Guidelines have widely been viewed as providing a coherent, reasonable struct ure for merger evaluation. Of course, the two contexts are quite different. The Guidelines apply to actual products and justify challenges to mergers that would significantly increase concentration and lead to market power. Analyses in innovation markets of \"concentration,\" \"competitive harm,\" and \"entry\" thus do not apply in exactly the same manner as in prod uct markets. But innovation markets nonetheless present analogous concerns. As I will elaborate in this Part, I propose the following framework to govern innovation-market analysis: First, the agencies must show that the merger would lead to significant concentration among firms reasonably likely to reach the market. Second, the agencies must offer a th eory that the merging firms will suppress innovation. Third, the merging firms can rebut the prima facie case of concentration by demonstrating that at least one other firm is likely to reach the marketplace. CARRIER _TRANSMITTED .DOC 2/26/2008 9:55 AM 416 93 IOWA LAW REVIEW [2008] Fourth, in a borderline case, the firms can demonstrate efficiencies from the merger. Fifth, in a borderline case, the firms can offer a Schumpeterian defense that size is needed to complete the regulatory process. The agencies currently ignore parts of the first and second, and all of the third, fourth, and fifth factors. In doing so, they engage in an unnecessarily truncated (and harmful) analysis. Such analysis may lower implementation costs but only at the cost of neglecting the realities of pharmaceutical innovation. Nor can the agencies justify such an abbreviated analysis as a type of \"per se\" rule. Co urts apply such bright-line rules because of the severe anticompetitive effects and unlikely procompetitive justifications of certain activities. But innovation-market mergers do not demonstrate such effects and, thus, ca ll for a more nuanced analysis than they have received. A. S TEP 1: EVALUATE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE MARKET The \"unifying theme\" of the Merger Guidelines is that \"mergers should not be permitted to create or enhanc e market power or to facilitate its exercise.\"121 Mergers cannot have this effe ct unless they \"significantly increase[] concentration and resu lt[] in a concentrated market.\"122 As described further below, a concentrated market increases the likelihood of collusion, by which competitors can increase price and reduce output. 123 There are no actual market s in an innovation-markets analysis. It is not possible to ascertain consumer demand or to determine the effect of a \"small but significant and nontransitory\" increase in price. 124 Nonetheless, concentration similarly leads to concern in these markets. As the R&D markets get significantly concentrated, the odds of more than one firm reaching the marketplace decrease. Consequently, the likelihood of product market competit ion decreases.

In short, the competition th at is necessary for pharmaceutical innovation is thwarted. The most important factor in determ ining the likelihood of reaching the market is the stage of FDA review. Firms in the pharmaceutical industry face daunting hurdles at each of th e stages. A brief background on the review process demonstrates just how difficult it is to reach the market. 1. FDA Review Process The FDA approval process is length y, proceeding th rough numerous stages. First, a company engages in discovery, selecting a target for a potential medicine and searching for a molecule that can act on the target.127 Upon finding such a molecule, the company enters preclinical testing, which utilizes tissue cell cultur es, computer-based data analyses, and live animals to determine whether the chemical compound will be safe and effective for human use.128 The odds of success in the discovery and preclinical stages are low: only 1 ou t of every 1000 tested compounds makes it to clinical studies.129 And because, as I show below, only 1 out of every 4 compounds (at most) in clinical trials ever makes it to the market, the odds of a compound in preclinical developm ent reaching the market are less than 1 in 4000. If the company does manage to succeed in the preclinical stage, then it files an Investigational New Drug Application (\"IND\") at the FDA.130 And if a board of \"scientists, ethicists, and health-care specialists approves the sponsor's study protocol\" and the FDA \"finds the approach promising,\" it accepts the IND, and the drug begins three stages of clinical studies. 131 126.

Phase II/III trials, for example, occur where \"Phase II-like trial[s are] sufficient to produce statistically sufficient data for approval, removing the need for a Phase III trial.\"135 Upon completion of clinical testin g, the firm prepares a New Drug Application (\"NDA\") and submits it to the FDA for review.136 NDA applicants also are required to identify any pate nt that claims the drug, with these patents listed in the \"Orange Book\" upon FDA approval.137 The likelihood that a drug will reach the marketplace increases significantly with each stage of review .

Concentration The previous subsection demonstrated how difficult it is for chemical compounds to reach the market. In part icular, it traced the divide between preclinical and clinical development and the importance of the product's clinical stage. The astronomical odds confronting firms in preclinical development call for caution in emphasizing Arrow's exhortation to competition. If the odds are less than 1 in 4000 that a firm will reach the market from preclinical development, there is less concern about the firm reducing its R&D paths in a way that would affect the likelihood of a product reaching the market. In preclinical development, for example, the odds of reaching clinical studies are approximately 1000 to 1. Industry realities thus do not show a race between competitors but rather a solitary quest to surmount the steep odds of making it to clinical trials. Drugs in preclinical development are so unlikely to succeed that merger challenges do not effectively promote competition. I therefore part company with the agencies and commentators in concluding that the agencies should not consider firms with products in preclinical development in determining the concentration of the R&D market. 145 A few examples illustrate the point. Where the merging firms only have products in preclinical development, the staggering odds that either one would reach the market, let alone both, counsels the agencies not to challenge the merger. Nor does a merger between a firm with a product in advanced trials (say, Phase III) and one in preclinical development raise concern. Even if\u2014as the FTC alleged in several challenges I discuss below\u2014 those two firms are \"closest\" to the ma rket, the improbability that the latter will ever reach the market reduces concern. Assertions of proximity to market that ignore the stage of review are overbroad and unrealistic. Thus, under my test, the agencies must show that the merger would lead to significant concentration among firms re asonably likely to reach the market. Firms with products in preclinical de velopment do not satisfy this test. Once the market is limited to products in clinical trials, the most important factors in determining market concentration become (1) the number of firms with products in these stages and (2) the specific stage of FDA review. The greatest concern applies when the number of competitors is low and the parties are at an advanc ed stage of FDA review. This occurs when a merger is proposed between the only two firms in clinical studies, both of which are in Phase III. In this case, no potential entry is anticipated 145. Nor should agencies and commentators be concerned that firms in preclinical studies are more likely to have a significant share of futu re products that reach th at stage. None of the challenged mergers discussed in Part IV invo lved firms in preclinical studies that had a monopoly over\u2014or even unique ability to develop\u2014particular types of treatments. 421 CARRIER _TRANSMITTED .DOC 2/26/2008 9:55 AM TWO PUZZLES RESOLVED for the foreseeable future, and the firm s are reasonably likely to reach the market. As discussed in the next Section, because the firms are close to the market, they would have the greatest ability and incentive to suppress a research path.146 To be sure, it is not certain that each of the merging firms in Phase III would have reached the market absent the merger. But there is a reasonable likelihood that they would have done so. And if the dangers of suppression apply anywhere, it is in this case. It is conceivable that the agencies could demonstrate concentrated markets where the merging parties have products in earlier stages. But such challenges should be rare. As the last subsection demonstrated, there is r o u g h l y a n 1 8 % c h a n c e o f m a k i n g i t t o m a r k e t f r o m P h a s e I , 3 0 % f r o m Phase II, and 57% from Phase III. Because it is unlikely that firms in Stage II and, especially, Stage I will reach the ma rket, challenges should be limited to categories such as anti-cancer drugs and AIDS drugs in which there is a greater likelihood of reaching the market or to other exceptional cases in which the anticompetitive harm s seem particularly acute. 147 Finally, and as discussed more fully below,148 where there is at least one firm other than the merging companies in clinical studies, the harm would tend to decrease. The closer to the market the competitor is (and the more numerous the rivals), the greater th e odds of success and the less the concern. The market concentration test I propose improves upon the agencies' version in two important ways. First, it takes into account the realities of the pharmaceutical industry. Drugs in preclinical development that have a 1 in 4000 chance of making it to the market do not present significant concern. Second, the test looks at not only the number of competitors in the market, but also the stage of FDA review. Given the markedly different odds confronting firms in each of the three stages, the test thus more effectively incorporates the realities of pharmaceutical development. B. S TEP 2: ASSESS COMPETITIVE HARM Under the Merger Guidelines, the agencies must demonstrate potential adverse competitive effects from the merger.149 The most important of these effects is the danger of collusion. As the number of firms in the market decreases, it becomes easier to reach an agreement to reduce supply 146. See infra text accompanying note 150. 147. See supra notes 139-44 and accompanying text (describing various drug categories' percentage chance of reaching the market). 148. See infra Part III.C. 149. MERGER GUIDELINES , supra note 2.0. CARRIER _TRANSMITTED .DOC 2/26/2008 9:55 AM 422 93 IOWA LAW REVIEW [2008] (thereby increasing price) and to police the terms of that agreement.150 In short, the likelihood of collusion increases. A second competitive harm occurs even in the absence of collusion. According to the theory of \"unilatera l competitive effects,\" the firms may\u2014 regardless of the actions of the other market participants\u2014raise price and reduce output.151 This is of particular concern where the products of the merging firms are similar.152 In innovation markets, the danger of collusion is markedly reduced. First, reaching an agreement is difficult. In contrast to fixing a price on homogeneous products, the multiple dimensions of R&D significantly decrease the likelihood of coordinating its direction or speed.153 Second, it is easier to cheat because innovation typically is \"conducted in secret.\"154 Finally, the manifest rewards of succe ssful innovation encourage cheating.155 But there is an analogue in the innovation-market context to unilateral competitive effects. In certain cases, the merging firms might\u2014regardless of the actions of other firms\u2014not wish to introduce new products. Especially as the similarity of the products increases, the likelihood of suppression increases. The second requirement of my test is that the agencies allege a theory of competitive harm. That theory typically will involve the potential suppression of a research path. As the concentration in the market increases and the products get closer to market , the incentive and ability to suppress one of the research paths increases. The incentive increases because it is more likely that a product will reach the market. Suppression matters most for probable future products (as opposed to speculative research paths) . Once success appears likely in the product market, firms naturally woul d recognize that suppression would have an effect. In contrast, in the ea rly stages, the incentive to suppress is much more attenuated because it is not needed: the staggering odds of the regulatory process itself create the same result. The ability to suppress also increases as the product gets closer to the market. The determination of the abilit y to suppress should incorporate the likelihood that suppression will have an effect. Of course, a firm technically 150. Such coordinated interaction includes activity that is profitable \"only as a result of the accommodating reactions of the [other firms].\" Id. \u00a7 2.1. 151.

But suppression is more likely to have an effect as the likelihood of reaching the market increases. In addition, the ability to suppress also ri ses with a reduction in the number of firms in the market because suppression will have a more direct effect in the absence of competitors.156 Incentive and ability to engage in anticompetitive effects thus will largely track the first inquiry concerning market concentration. There are two additional factors that increase the likelihood of suppression: cannibalization and similar products. First, if one of the merging firms has a currently existing treatment for a condition, that firm may have a lower incentive to introduce a new product. In many cases, sales of the new pr oduct would reduce the sales of the current product. 157 The distinction between drastic and nondrastic innovation articulated above is instructive here.158 The monopolist has less incentive than the competitive firm to introduce a drastic innovation because such an innovation would displace its monopoly in the market for the previous product.159 In most of the challenged mergers, this factor would not have applied since (1) there was no current treatmen t or (2) the treatment was offered by a nonmerging firm. But in two of the cases, one of the merging firms had market power in the previo us generation's product.160 Where this is the case, and particularly where the firm's R&D appears directed to a drastic innovation, it is more likely that there will be competitive harm. The second factor involves the rela tionship between the two products. The closer the products are, the greate r the incentive to suppress one of the products. This conclusion overlaps with the Merger Guidelines' recognition that the similarity of the merging firms' products increases the likelihood of unilateral competitive effects. 161 As the similarity of R&D paths increases, the need for both decreases. As a result , the merging firms have a greater incentive to suppress one of them. 156.

M ERGER GUIDELINES 2.211. CARRIER _TRANSMITTED 2/26/2008 9:55 AM 424 93 IOWA LAW REVIEW [2008] In short, the theory of competitive harm will largely depend on the level of concentration of the R&D market and the stage of FDA review of the merging and nonmerging firms. But two additional factors increase the likelihood of anticompetitive harm: (1 ) a merging firm's market power in the previous generation's product (esp ecially for drastic innovations) and (2) similar research paths. C. S TEP 3: EVALUATE THE ENTRY DEFENSE In the Merger Guidelines, entry negates the adverse effects of concentration. If entry into the market is easy, then firms cannot sustain price increases, and it is less likely that the merger would lead to the creation of market power.162 In the parlance of the Guidelines, entry would \"deter an anticompetitive merger in its incipiency\" or \"deter or counteract the competitive effects of concern.\"163 In the innovation-market context, in contrast, there is no currently existing product market that an outsid e firm could enter. But the underlying policy of the Guidelines nonetheless appl ies. If another firm in addition to the merged firm makes it to the market, then, by definition, there will be competition. Compet ition is important for pharmaceutical innovation, and the presence of a competitor reduces suppression concerns. Even if competition is not as robust as it wo uld be in a more atomistic market, the presence of a single non-monopolist competitor in the market increases the likelihood of innovation. To be sure, the determination of entry is speculative in both the product and innovation-market contexts. The Merger Guidelines require entry to be \"timely, likely, and suffi cient in its magnitude, character and scope to deter or counteract the competitive effects of concern.\" 164 Determining these characteristics for a future occurrence is speculative. Similarly, in the innovation-marke t context, we do not know which companies eventually will make it to th e market. But significant guidance is offered by the odds of success at each stage of the FDA review process. The merging firms therefore are able to offer a defense based on the likelihood that another firm will enter the market. The identity of products in various stages is public information that is easily discoverable. 165 And the stage of review provides an instructive guide to the odds of reaching the market. Firms in Phase III are the most likely to reach the market, with approximately a 57% likelihood of su ccess. If two firms other than the 162. Id. \u00a7 3.0. 163. Id. 164. Id. 165.

Where there is only one nonmerging firm in Phase III, the odds of that firm making it to the market (and thereby offering competition) are approximately 57%. In this case, though it is less certain that there will be competition, it is still a reasonable possibility. The agencies thus should accept a more qualified defense, which could make a difference in close cases. This type of qualified defense also would apply in other cases with similar odds of success. For example, if two firms are in Phase II, then the odds of success are 51% (a 9% likelihood of both and a 42% chance of one). 167 Different permutations dete rmine the odds of entry. D. S TEP 4: EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCIES DEFENSE An additional defense that the merging firms could offer is that the merger will lead to efficiencies. The Merger Guidelines recognize several types of efficiencies: an enhanced ability and incentive to compete, the introduction of new or improved products, and \"a better utilization of existing assets\" that allows the combined firm to lower its costs. 168 The Guidelines explain that marginal cost reductions resulting from shifting production among facilities are the most substantial and verifiable type of efficiency. 169 R&D efficiencies \"are potentially substantial\" but \"less susceptible to verification.\"170 In order to be considered, the efficiencies must be \"merger-specific,\" achievable only through merger. The agencies consider whether cognizable efficiencies would be \"sufficient to re verse the merger's potential to harm consumers in the relevant market.\"171 The efficiencies tend to achieve this result when the likely adverse competitive effects are \"not great.\"172 In 166. The odds of both firms maki ng it to the market are .57 * .57 = .3249. The odds of only one firm succeeding are 2 * (.57 * .43) = .4902. Th erefore, the odds of at least one firm making it are .3249 + .4902 = .8151. 167. The odds of both firms making it to the market are .30 * .30 = .0 9. The odds of only one firm succeeding are 2 * (.30 * .70) = .42. Therefore, the odds of at least one firm making it are .09 + .42 = .51. 168. MERGER GUIDELINES , supra note 121, \u00a7 4. 169.

CARRIER _TRANSMITTED .DOC 2/26/2008 9:55 AM 426 93 IOWA LAW REVIEW [2008] particular, they \"almost never justify a merger to monopoly or near\u00admonopoly.\" 173 In the innovation-market context, there are no products for which marginal cost can be reduced. But the introduction of new products is the goal of pharmaceutical R &D. The relevant efficiency thus takes the form of an increased likelihood that the firms will be able to reach the market. In certain cases, the merging firms may be able to combine complementary knowledge and expertise in a way that would increase the likelihood of success. Of course, pharmaceutical firms merge for numerous reasons other than achieving efficiencies in R&D markets. In the late 1990s, for example, there was significant consolidation in the industry, with mergers driven by pressures to reduce costs and \"bolster drug pipelines\" in the face of decreasing profit margins. 174 Other firms merged to utilize excess capacity or as an \"exit strategy when faced with financial trouble.\"175 But sometimes the merger will help firms in the particular R&D market. For example, benefits were offered in the merger between Genzyme and Novazyme, two companies researching Po mpe disease, a fatal and difficult- to-treat disease affecting infants and young children.176 The merger made comparative experiments possible, as the companies could engage in a \"comprehensive, blinded pre-clinical analysis comparing all four [relevant] enzymes.\" 177 The merger also \"provided information that enabled the Novazyme program to avoid drilling dry holes\" and relatedly accelerated the Novazyme program. 178 Finally, it allowed Novazyme to gain access to a Genzyme assay, to use Genzyme cell lines scalable for a Pompe enzyme, to measure glycogen reduction, and to le arn patients' reactions to earlier Pompe products.179 Because only Genzyme had this experience with Pompe disease, no other company could offer these benefits. Where it is particularly difficult to reach the market, and where there is no currently existing treatment, the ag encies should most seriously consider the efficiencies claim. For example, in the Genzyme-Novazyme merger, there was no available treatment for a fatal disease. Of equally significant concern, Pompe disease is one of forty-one diseases known as lysosomal 173.

This mirrors the Merger Guidelines' direction to consider efficiencies most seriously \"when the likely adverse competitive effects, absent the efficiencies, are not great.\" 183 In contrast, just as \"[e]fficiencies [in product markets] almost never justify a merger to monopoly or near-monopoly,\" 184 they typically will not sanction an innovation-market merger where there is a significant concentration of firms reasonably likely to reach the market. In short, the merging firms can proffer efficiencies that increase the likelihood that the product will reach the market. The agencies should most seriously consider these efficiencies as market concentration decreases and as the difficulty of reaching the market increases. E. STEP 5: EVALUATE THE SCHUMPETERIAN DEFENSE The final defense bears some overlap with the current \"failing firms\" defense. The Guidelines state that \"a merger is not likely to create or enhance market power or to facilitate its exercise, if imminent failure . . . of one of the merging firms would cause th e assets of that firm to exit the relevant market.\" 185 The rationale is simple: \"I n such circumstances, post- merger performance in the relevant market may be no worse than market performance had the merger been blocked and the assets left the market.\"186 Small firms in innovation markets may not be in danger of failing. But they face a related challenge in the towering hurdles of the regulatory process, which can block development. As discussed above, the process is lengthy, with Phase III trials in particular requiring thousands of subjects. For that reason, a merger might allow a smaller firm to pursue expensive and administratively complex clinical trials that otherwise would be 180. Id. at 2. 181.

Absent a merger or other co llaboration, in other words, the firm would not be able to proceed th rough the development process. Allowing a defense for such firms is a concrete manifestation of Schumpeter's theoretical co nstruct and incorporates the Part II finding that size is important in navigating the FDA process. Schumpeter emphasized the importance of size in offering financial resources and investment.187 Although some of his arguments applied only to monopolies, most were satisfied by large firms.188 In fact, the hurdles of the FDA regulatory process demonstrate the need for size, particul arly in conducting Phase III trials. Even if monopoly is not necessary to navigate the process, size is.189 In many mergers, this defense will not apply. Firms merge for many reasons, such as cost pres sures and emptying pipelines.190 Even in innovation-market cases, companies o ften focus on product markets, with millions of dollars in sales. In addition, many of the cases involve large pharmaceutical companies that coul d easily conduct clinical studies. Merging firms that are in Phase III stud ies have already shown the ability to navigate the regulatory process. But where a small firm with a promising compound could not otherwise pursue clinical trials, the agencies should consider such a defense. The firm could demonstrate an inability to pr oceed by introducing evidence of reasonably objective factors like market capitalization, assets, and profits. Like the efficiency defense, the Schumpeterian defense would be most persuasive where there is only modest concentration among firms reasonably likely to reach the market. * * * In short, the proposed framework builds on the current merger analysis, adapting it to account fo r the realities and hurdles of the pharmaceutical regulatory process. The most important factor in the agencies' case is the first, by which the agencies must show that the merger would lead to significant concentration among firms reasonably likely to reach the market. Where this factor is met, the second factor, by which the agencies must offer a theory that the merging firms will suppress innovation, likely is satisfied. And where it is absent, competitive harm is not a real concern. The third, fourth, and fifth elemen ts allow the merging parties to present defenses to the agencies' claims. The third, by which the merging firms can demonstrate that at least on e other firm is likely to reach the marketplace, is the most important since a rival's entry promises to 187.

The fourth (merger- specific efficiencies) and fifth (Sch umpeterian defense for small firms) factors will not apply in many cases. But when they do, the agencies will need to balance the threat from concentr ation against the proffered benefits. That they currently do not engage in such a nuanced comparison demonstrates what is missing in the analysis today. IV. E MPIRICAL STUDIES There have been ten challenges to (and one prominent refusal to challenge) mergers in innovation markets. Two of these challenges occurred outside the pharmaceutical industry. In 1993, the U.S. Department of Justice (in its only innovation-market case) ch allenged General Motors' attempt to sell one of its divisions to ZF Friedrichshafen AG on the basis that the two firms were the primary producers of heavy-duty automatic truck and bus transmissions. 191 Two years later, the FTC challenged Sensormatic's acquisition of Knogo, claiming that the two firms were the only ones conducting R&D for the next genera tion of antishoplifting equipment. 192 Every other innovation-market challenge occurred in the pharmaceutical industry. The nine pharmaceutical mergers (of which eight were ultimately challenged), of course, involved many product lines. In addition to R&D markets, some mergers involved produc ts that were in actual competition (i.e., both merging parties had products). Others involved potential competition (i.e., one of the merging firms had a product). But the universe of pharmaceutical merger challenges in which there was at least one overlapping research line for which there was not yet a product on the market is limited to these nine cases. Until now, most of the discussion of these cases has been limited to the facts alleged in FTC complaints. Because these matters have been resolved by consent agreement, there has been remarkably little information beyond the agreement that has been subject to debate. There are no court cases examining the validity of the FTC's alle gations. Even scholarly analysis has not challenged the allegations. In addition, the entities most likely to question such determinations\u2014 the merging firms themselv es\u2014have not done so. As mentioned above, the companies typically have numerous reasons to merge, such as cost pressures and disappearing pipelines. 193 In addition, the innovation market usually is one market out of many affected by the merger. Multiple product markets, with millions of dollars in current sales, are the parties' primary concern. 191. Complaint, United States v. Gen. Motors Corp., No. 93-530 (D. Del.

CARRIER _TRANSMITTED .DOC 2/26/2008 9:55 AM 430 93 IOWA LAW REVIEW [2008] In short, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the FTC's pharmaceutical innovation-m arket challenges. This Part offers the first such assessment. Four questions frame the analysis: What was the pre-merger treatment (if any) for the condition? At the time of the merger, in which stage of preclinical or clinical review were the merging companies? Were there other companies in preclinical or clinical studies at the time of the merger? What does the market look like today? For each merger, I answer these questions. I then apply my test to determine whether the FTC correctly challenged the mergers. I conclude that the agency was correct in five out of the nine cases. But application of my test would have altered the outc ome in four of the nine cases\u2014the mergers between Roche and Genentech, AHP and American Cyanamid, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, and Pf izer and Warner Lambert. A. ROCHE -GENENTECH 1. Case Study In November 1990, the FTC entered into a consent decree with Roche and Genentech.194 The relevant market covered \"CD4-based therapeutics for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infection.\"195 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (\"HIV\") attacks a patient by atta ching itself to the protein CD-4, a receptor on the surface of immune cells that helps the virus gain entry into the cell.196 Experimental drugs allowed an engineered CD-4 protein to circulate in the bloodstream, picking up the virus before it could affect living immune cells.197 The FTC alleged that Genentech was \"the most advanced of a limited number of companies developing CD4- based therapeutics for use in the treatment of AIDS/HIV infection.\"198 Roche was \"also engaged in\" similar R&D and \"ha[d] patent applications pending on its products.\"199 At the time of the merger, Genentech was in Phase I studies.200 Roche was in preclinical studies.201 A rival, Biogen, was in Phase I/II trials.202 As a 194.

The closest product is Hoffman La Roche's Fuzeon, which was developed by Trimeris and approved by the FDA in March 2003.205 2. Application Application of my test shows that the FTC should not have challenged this merger. In particular, the agency would not have been able to demonstrate the first step of a concentrated market. Genentech was in Phase I, and Roche was in preclinical studies. Of the nine cases, this is the weakest case of concentration because it was unlikely that either firm would have reached the market. As it turns out, the compulsory licensing requirement imposed on Roche was not beneficial. In fact, because of unsuccessful studies and exorbitant costs, each of the merging firms abandoned their CD-4 efforts shortly after the merger. Although a related drug was approved in 2003, there are no drugs similar to those of Roche and Genentech on the market today. 206 202. See Biogen Inc.

Case Study In November 1994, the FTC approved the merger of American Home Products (\"AHP\") and American Cyanamid (\"Cyanamid\"). The agency initially had alleged an effect on an i nnovation market for a vaccine to treat rotavirus, \"a diarrheal disease that causes thousands of children's deaths annually.\" 207 In particular, it claimed that the merging companies were \"two of only three producers of vaccines with research projects either in or near the clinical trial stage\" of FDA review.208 I t r e q u i r e d t h a t A H P l i c e n s e Cyanamid's rotavirus vaccine research to a third party.209 At the time of the merger, AHP was in Phase II/III studies.210 Cyanamid appeared to be in preclinical studies.211 A third company, Virus Research Institute (\"VRI\"), also appeared to be in preclinical studies.212 For several years after the merger, there were no products on the market. Although the FDA approved AHP's product, RotaShield, in 1998,213 the firm pulled the product less than one year later because of an increased risk of intussception, a rare blockage or twisting of the intestine.214 Cyanamid's product did not reach clinical trials in the United States and was 207.

It is difficult to document Cyanamid's precise development stage. But unlike the record for products that make it to clinical studies, I have been unable to uncover evidence\u2014 through news articles, securities filings, and general Internet searches\u2014that Cyanamid's product made it to that stage. This result is confirmed by the alle gation in the FTC complaint that AHP and Cyanamid had products \"in or near the clinic al trial stage.\" Hon. Christine A. Varney, Commissioner, U.S. Fed.

The FTC did not us e this language when challenging any of the mergers where the firms both had products in clinic al studies. In this case, because AHP was in clinical studies, it seems reason able to assume that Cyanamid was the treatment \"near\" clinical review (i.e., in preclinical studies). 212.

Application Application of my test shows that the FTC should not have challenged the merger. Again, the agency would not have been able to demonstrate the first step of a concentrated market. Even though AHP was in Phase II/III, Cyanamid was in preclinical development. An ex post review confirms that the merger challenge was not necessary. Although Merck's Rotateq received FDA approval in February 2006, this development was related to the merger challenge only in that the failure of AHP's product prompted Merck's development. AHP's product made it to the market in 1998 but was pulled because of complications. And Cyanamid's divested product never reached clinical trials in the United States. 220 C. G LAXO -WELLCOME 1.

Wellcome's 311C was in Phase III trials,226 and Glaxo's Naramig was in either Phase II or Phase III.227 As a condition of the merger, the FTC required the companies to divest Wellcome's 311C.228 In 2006, Glaxo's Imitrex had 56% of the migraine drug market.229 Products with at least of Merck's Maxalt, Pfizer's Relpax, and Zeneca's Zomig.230 These figures show increasing competition as compared to figures from 2003 (when Imitrex had 60%, Zomig had 11%, and Maxalt and Maxalt had 1%).232 2.

The new product primaril y resembles a drastic innovation because most patients will prefer oral to injectable treatment.234 Even though there are elements of nondrastic innovation (because of the need for injectable treatment for migraines with nausea or vomiting, \"morning migraines,\" and \"rapidly escalating migraines\"), 235 the significant improvement offered by noninjectable treatment demonstrates the type of drastic innovation bolstering the co nclusion of anticompetitive harm. Nor would the merging parties be able to offer defenses sufficient to reverse this outcome. No rivals were in clinical studies, let alone poised to enter the market. The efficiencies defense would not apply because there was already an injectable treatment on the market. And the size of the firms would prevent the use of the Schumpeterian defense. An ex post analysis confirms that the FTC correctly challenged the merger. There is currently a robust market for noninjectable migraine treatment, as four companies (Glaxo, Merck, Pfizer, and Zeneca) each possess at least 10% of the market. 236 Of particular significance, Wellcome's divestiture played a direct role in Zeneca's presence on the market today. D. U PJOHN -PHARMACIA 1.

Application The FTC correctly challenged the merger. Because Baxter had a product in Phase II/III and Immuno was in Phase II, the agency could have demonstrated significant concentratio n among firms reasonably likely to reach the market. Although there is modestly less concern because the merging firms were not quite in the final stages of review, that is not enough to prevent the conclusion of a significantly concentrated market. And a theory of innovation suppression, though slightly less persuasive because neither firm was in Phase III, would have followed from the showing of market concentration. At the time of the merger, another firm, Vitex, was in Phase II. While this provides some solace, it does not rise to the level of likely entry by another firm. Nor would the efficiencies and Schumpeterian defenses have applied. Finally, the suitability of the FTC's licensing requirement is borne out by a robust market that includes not only market leader Baxter and competitors Aventis and Omrix, but also Haemacure, the licensee that received Baxter's product. 267 F.

Application Application of my test shows that the FTC should not have challenged the merger. The agency would not have been able to demonstrate the first step of a concentrated market. Even though Sandoz was in Phase II/III, Ciba-Geigy was in preclinical development. And despite the compulsory licensing ordered in the merger, there still is no effective gene therapy treatment on the U.S. market today. Of course, the difficulties of gene therapy treatm ent prevent a confident assertion that there would have been success absent a merger challenge. But these very difficulties point to an efficiency defense that the parties could have offered. 281 In any event, the challenge did not prevent anticompetitive harm or lead to market success.282 G. PFIZER -WARNER -LAMBERT 1. Case Study In June 2000, the FTC entered into a consent agreement with Pfizer and Warner-Lambert.

Application The FTC should not have challe nged the merger, which did not threaten significant concentration amon g firms reasonably likely to reach the market. Neither of the merging firms had reached the final stage of FDA review: Pfizer was in Phase II and Warner -Lambert was in Phase I. Even if the market likelihood percentages are adjust ed upward to take into account the higher success rates of anti-cancer treatments, they still only demonstrate 48% and 42% likelihood, respectively. 297 While Pfizer's development partner eventually was able to bring the divested product to market, the merged company did not encounter such succ ess with Warner-Lambert's Phase I product. 298 In addition, the merging firms coul d have offered a powerful defense based on likely entry by competitors. Two firms, Astra-Zeneca and Imclone, each were in Phase III, making it very likely that at least one of the firms would reach the market and offer competition. In fact, both products did reach the market. Although Astra-Zeneca's Iressa was pulled from the market after a disappointing clinical tr ial, Imclone's Erbitux is still on the market. 299 H. G LAXO WELLCOME -SMITH KLINEBEECHAM 1.

The challenge also was plagued by a questionable market definition, as the relevant market appeared to cover patients' conditions, not drug delivery mechanisms. The FTC defined a market even though EGFR inhibitors targeted different cancers and worked in different ways. If the agency had defined the market according to the type of condition being treated, there likely would have been no challenge. For exampl e, colorectal cancer could be treated through not only EGFR inhibitors but also other types of similarly effective treatment, which today are offered by Amgen, Genentech/Roche, Imclone/BMS, and others.

In comparison to Valtrex, the vaccine offered elements of both drastic and nondrastic innovation. The innova tion would be drastic for patients who do not have herpes and thus would not need suppressive treatment. But it would be nondrastic for patients wh o already have herpes because it would be too late for a vaccine and the pa tients would still need suppressive treatment. The factor therefore demonstrates moderate cannibalization concerns, buttressing concerns of anticompetitive harm. Nor would the defenses have reversed this outcome. No rivals were in clinical studies, let alone poised to enter the market. And the size of the firms would have prevented the use of the Schumpeterian defense. Under my test, the parties could offer an efficiency defense based on the difficulty of developing vaccines, wh ich is confirmed by the absence of a herpes vaccine on the market today. Bu t this efficiency would not outweigh the concentration demonstrated by on e firm in Phase II and the other in Phase III. I. G ENZYME -NOVAZYME 1.

The agency's refusal to challenge the merger thus is consistent with my conclusion that there was no significant concentration among firms re asonably likely to reach the market. The merging firms also could have offered a strong efficiency defense under my test. The parties offered merger-specific benefits that made it more likely that one firm would reach the market (and reach it faster). This was particularly important because there was no treatment for a fatal disease, one that, as a type of lysosomal st orage disorder (\"LSD\"), presented exceedingly difficult challenges. 326 Additionally, the firms could offer a Schumpeterian defense. Novazyme was \"a small research company\" sales 327 and \"less than $10 million in total assets.\"328 I t \" h a d n o products in clinical trials, and no clinical-scale or commercial-scale manufacturing facilities.\"329 The merger was necessary for Novazyme to survive the regulatory process. Finally, an ex post analysis of the market shows that the lack of merger challenge did not prevent Genzyme's Myozyme from reaching the market in 2006.330 * * * The chart below synthesizes these cases. 326.

This was the case in fo ur of the FTC's challenges to mergers: (1) Glaxo and Wellcome, (2) Upjohn and Pharmacia, (3) GlaxoWellcome and SmithKline Beecham, and (4) Baxt er and Immuno. In a fifth correct decision, the FTC decided not to challenge the merger between Genzyme and Novazyme. But the lack of an analysis similar to the Merger Guidelines and the neglect of the stage of FDA review led to unnecessary (and even counterproductive) challenges in four of the nine mergers: (1) Roche and Genentech, (2) AHP and Cyanamid, (3) Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, and (4) Pfizer and Warner-Lambert. By fleshing out the FTC's current ad hoc analysis, my test promises to increa se confidence in a justifiable and beneficial innovation -markets framework. C ONCLUSION The concept of innovation markets has been much maligned. This Article has shown that, for pharmaceutical mergers, the characteristics of the industry rebut most of the criticisms. It also offers a partial resolution of the longstanding debate between Schumpeter and Arrow about the market structure most conducive to innovation . An analysis of product innovation, technological opportunity, and appropri ability demonstrates the importance of size and (especially) competition in the industry. And the showing of competition's significance confirms the propriety of enforcement in pharmaceutical innovation markets. On a practical level, the Article offers the first comprehensive framework that can be applied to innovation-market analysis. The framework improves the current anal ysis by considering not only the number of firms in R&D, but also the stage of FDA review. Given the significant hurdles facing firms in pharmaceutical development and the wildly varying odds of success at ea ch of the stages, it no longer is appropriate to neglect this factor. Firms in preclinical development should not be considered part of the relevant market, and the most imminent harm is presented by merging firms in Phase III. The new test also creates new defenses based on entry, efficiencies, and lack of size. Finally, the Article offers the first empirical analysis of all the challenged innovation-market cases in the pharmaceutical industry. It ventures far beyond the FTC allegations that, unt il now, have constituted the record upon which discussion has taken place. And it concludes that the FTC was only correct in approximately half of the challenged cases. Applying the economic studies to the pharmaceutical industry demonstrates the important role to be played by innovation markets. But these markets need a better framework. The test I offer in this Article is CARRIER _TRANSMITTED .DOC 2/26/2008 9:55 AM 450 93 IOWA LAW REVIEW [2008] more comprehensive, predictable, and root ed in industry realities. In short, it is a more powerful foundation for innovation-markets analysis. "}
