More than 40 volunteers drawn from University of Alberta nursing students are part of the ongoing clinical trial to determine if the root of Rhodiola rosea can be effectively used to increase mental and physical endurance, reduce fatigue, alleviate stress and boost the immune system. These fourth-year students \u2014 many of whom are working evening and night shifts as part of their course work \u2014 are being given capsules containing either Rhodiola rosea extract or a placebo. After a month on the capsules, the two groups will be measured for fatigue, quality of life, stress levels, physical vigour, cognitive ability and overall health. \"We have an opportunity to look specifically at an herb that's grown here, and to see whether or not it can help people with mental and physical fatigue. And that's certainly something that affects lots of people,\" says Dr. Sunita Vohra, Director of the AHS Complementary and Alternative Research and Education program, based in Edmonton. \"Rhodiola has been used for thousands of years. It's not intended as a substitute for sufficient nightly sleep, which is essential for good health. It's intended to help people feel better at whatever they're doing, whether it's mental or physical functioning. We don't think it's a stimulant. It isn't caffeine. It isn't a pep pill. It's thought of as something that is gentler and thought to work more in keeping with your body's natural inherent processes.\" Involving student nurses in the research seemed a natural fit, says Karin Olson, a Faculty of Nursing professor and project co-investigator. \"There's lots of stress associated with their shift work, partly because of its impact on the sleep cycle,\" says Olson. \"All evidence we have so far suggests this is a safe product. This is a great opportunity for us to see if, in this student population, the product works the way we think it does.\" Performing wellness research to directly improve the health of Albertans is among the goals outlined in the 5-Year Health Action Plan, jointly developed by the Government of Alberta and AHS, and supported by the province's stable, 5-year funding. Rhodiola rosea thrives in a dry, cold climate, and is native to Siberia, as well as the Arctic and alpine regions of Asia and Europe. Touted in some media as \"The Herbal Superstar of the 21st Century\" and featured in Newsweek, Woman's World, Science News and even by television personality Dr. Oz (who mixes it into his Brain-Boosting Smoothie), Rhodiola may be famous \u2014 but more research needs to be done as to exactly why, or how well, it works. Vohra's team has been involved with the Rhodiola rosea project for several years, participating in the initial review of the herb, as well as the development of the capsules of an extract of the root, called rosavin. \"It's been an interesting, innovative project,\" says Vohra. \"It's brought together people from many different areas of expertise, including agriculture, business development, engineering, pharmacy, medicine, nursing and public health, with the idea of coming up with something that has proven health effects while creating economic opportunity. This has the capacity to not only help Albertans in terms of their health, but also economically from field to medicine cabinet, for farmers, growers, producers and the value chain all the way to health-food stores.\" Rhodiola rosea was introduced to Alberta farmers through a provincial government agricultural development program. \"The opportunity is clearly there if someone could learn to cultivate and process it on a commercial scale,\" says project lead Dr. Susan Lutz, a manager at Alberta Agricultural and Rural Development. \"We think Alberta can be a leader in this.\" Alberta Health Services is the provincial health authority responsible for planning and delivering health supports and services for more than 3.7 million adults and children living in Alberta. Its mission is to provide a patient-focused, quality health system that is accessible and sustainable for all Albertans. - 30 - "}
