Welcome to our online booking site Chiropractic [Read More](1-description) Chiropractors diagnose, treat and help prevent conditions and disorders related to muscles, bones, joints and nerves. As primary care practitioners, chiropractors can develop and carry out a comprehensive treatment and management plan, which may include manual therapy, exercise, and nutritional, dietary and lifestyle counselling. Chiropractic care may complement or support medical treatment by relieving the musculoskeletal aspects associated with other conditions. Massage Therapy Massage therapy is the manipulation of soft tissues of the body including, muscles, connective tissues, tendons, ligaments and joints. Massage Therapy is a clinically-oriented healthcare approach that can alleviate the discomforts associated with day-to-day and occupational stresses, muscular over-use, and many acute and chronic pain conditions. Acupuncture [Read More](13-description) Acupuncture is the insertion of very thin, metal needles to stimulate specific points (acupuncture points) on the body. Acupuncture is a component of the ancient practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) used to diagnose, treat and prevent disease. TCM is based on the belief that the body's vital energy (qi) flows along energy pathways (meridians) in the body to maintain balance. When the body is healthy, qi flows smoothly, but when the qi flow is disrupted, it can cause disease or illness. Acupuncture works on improving the flow of qi, restoring balance and activating the body's internal healing abilities. It is an effective treatment alone or in combination with conventional therapies. Athletic Therapy [Read More](9-description) Athletic Therapy is a health care profession dedicated to the prevention, assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of all types of musculoskeletal injury. Athletic Therapists are certified health care professionals who treat bone, ligament, tendon, muscle or joint issues. This includes acute, chronic, age-related and long-term injuries. Athletic Therapists employ a range of treatment techniques including massage therapy and other soft-tissue therapies, joint mobilizations, therapeutic modalities and exercise rehabilitation. A key component of Athletic Therapy is patient education. Concussion Management Dr. Sophia da Silva-Oolup has been trained in concussion assessment and management techniques and can provide you with the education, care, and rehabilitation you require to get back to your daily activities. Osteopathy Osteopathy is a client-centred discipline that is based on understanding the relationship between structure and function in order to enhance the body's inherent ability to heal. It relies on skilled manual therapeutic techniques to assess and treat the client, guiding the natural self-healing properties of the human body. Naturopathic Medicine [Read More](14-description) Naturopathic Medicine is a distinct primary health care system that blends modern scientific knowledge with traditional and natural forms of medicine. Naturopathic medicine is the art and science of disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention using natural therapies including botanical medicine, clinical nutrition, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, naturopathic manipulation, traditional Chinese medicine / acupuncture, and lifestyle counseling. Naturopathic doctors can also complement and enhance health care services provided by other health care professionals. They cooperate with other branches of medical science referring patients to other practitioners for diagnosis or treatment when appropriate. Naturopathic Doctors provide patients with a truly integrative form of health care. Reiki [Read More](15-description) Reiki meaning \"universal life force energy\" is an ancient Japanese form of energy healing involving the transfer of universal energy from the Reiki practitioner's hands to the client. According to Reiki practitioners, energy can stagnate in the body where there has been illness or injury. Reiki aims to help the flow of energy and remove energetic blocks in a similar way to acupuncture or acupressure. During the session, the Reiki practitioner places their hands lightly on or just above different areas of the client's body. Unlike massage, the client is fully clothed and there is no manipulation of the skin tissue. Reiki is a gentle yet extremely powerful technique which heals on a physical, mental, emotional and spiritual level. Reiki complements other types of medical and therapeutic treatments, and can increase the efficacy of other types of healing. Clinical Mindful Pilates [Read More](16-description) So what is Pilates? Pilates is a mind-body art and practice. One of the reasons it is an art is because any of the movements can be modified to suit individual needs at any given time. This is why professional dancers and athletes who are injured gravitated to this practice for recovery, restoration and injury prevention. These goals are also important for ordinary people like you, me and my clients because we too want to recover and prevent injury so we can enjoy our lives to the fullest. We call it a practice because like with most art forms, the more you repeat the exercises, the better you get at doing them. There are deep mind-body connections or neuromuscular connections fairly unique to Pilates that take time to develop. And establishing these neuromuscular connections are what is necessary for mastery. Even at the age of 59 and after over 20 years of practice, I still have to be consistent about my practice, because like all skills, if you don't use it, you lose it. And, being in tune with and able to connect with our deepest core muscles is much too valuable a skill to lose as this affects our ability to move well and live our lives to the fullest.
