Paradigm-changing discoveries From the development of SPF ratings to finding new ways to treat cancer, our researchers have established a legacy of translating laboratory discoveries into clinical treatments. Here are just a few of our paradigm-changing innovations. 1958 Joshua Lederberg awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on bacteria reproduction and antibiotic resistance. 1975 Howard Temin is named co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in medicine for discovering reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that explains how retroviruses cause cancer and AIDS. 1998 James Thomson and his research team become the first in the world to derive a human embryonic stem cell line. Today's advances, tomorrow's cures From the tiniest cells to Big Data, our investigators are making key discoveries that lead to better treatments.
