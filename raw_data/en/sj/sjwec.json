TCM views of cancer and the approach toward cancer treatment Cancer is one of the major causes of mortality in humans throughout the world. According to a report dealing with the in-cidence and mortality of cancers in the USA, a total of 1479350new cancer cases and 562340 deaths from cancer were projectedto occur in 2009 [1]. For cancer treatment by conventional medi-cine, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been the pri-mary approaches, but they are not always effective. As of today,cancer is still the most threatening and difficult to treat disease.Cancerous conditions are well-known in the traditional Chinesemedical system. In the classics of TCM, \"Huang Di Nei Jing Di \" () published more than 2000 years ago, there are de- scriptions of the pathogenesis, appearances and treatment prin-ciples of tumors ( ), such as muscle, tendon and bone carcino- mas; however, this term does not differentiate between malig-nant and nonmalignant tumors. It was not until the Sung Dy-nasty (ca. 1300 AD) that the first reference to cancer -the Chi- nese word Ai ( ) meaning malignant carcinoma -first appeared in the ancient medical book \"Wei Ji Bao Shu \"(). Accord- ing to the theories of TCM, cancer is caused by imbalances be-tween endogenous physical conditions of the body and exoge-nous pathogenic factors. The internal condition of the body playsa dominant role in the onset of cancer. In other words, factors caninduce cancer only when the body s own defense system fails. Those pathogenic factors, in Chinese medicine terms, include ac-cumulated toxins, heat and blood stasis, and they attack when aperson is in a weak physical condition, without the strength toresist. Furthermore, malfunction of the body-mind communica-tion network may also trigger the development of cancer [2]. So,TCM doctors view cancer as a systemic disease associated withthe state of the whole body (or disturbance of the signaling net-work, to use a modern term). \"Systemic \"in the TCM doctors views, means \"state of the whole body \".\"Cancer is the manifesta- tion of a breakdown in the body s ability to handle pathogenic factors, not a local disease of cells or organs. \"Accordingly, the treatment philosophy and strategy of TCM emphasizes holisticmodulation and improvement of the whole body rather than re-moving the tumor mass or killing the cancerous cells. This treat-ment strategy is particularly enforced for cancer patients at thelate stages. In these stages, the focus of treatment is extendingthe life expectancy and improving the quality of life of the pa-tient; in other words, the focus is on the patient not the tumormass (). The other major principle of TCM is the emphasis on an individ-ual therapy. For the same type of cancer in different persons, thediagnosis and treatment schemes could be very different. This iscalled the principle of \"treatment based on symptom pattern dif- ferentiation ( )\". In other words, TCM doctors make the diagnosis and prepare a treatment scheme based on the assess-ment of the pattern of symptoms manifest in each individual.When herbs are called for, most commonly, several are used to-gether, and the whole herbs are used, not purified compounds.Thus, in the prescription, there will be multiple effective compo-nents delivering a comprehensive, integrated treatment of cancer through multiple targets and their associated pathways. This ap-proach is in line with the view of TCM that cancer is a systemicdisease that requires a holistic approach and medicines that canproduce therapeutic actions through multiple targets. While thisapproach differs from that of conventional medicine, the effectsof treatment still come down to biochemistry. If treatments areeffective, then there must be underlying mechanisms that canbe investigated and verified scientifically. Understanding thesemechanisms can help us expand the efficacy of both Westernand Chinese medicines in a logical, rational way. Evaluation of the Therapeutic Effects of TCM Herbal Medicines in Cancer Treatment - The Benefits and the Obstacles ! To provide the scientific basis for the effectiveness of TCM against cancer, a number of clinical and laboratory studies have beendone in the past decades. However, due to various factors -in- cluding inconsistency in treatment schemes, the limited sam-pling sizes, and lack of quality assurance of the herbal products-well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCT) to prove the effectiveness of TCM as adjuvant therapy for cancer are scarce. Ingeneral, most of the published clinical studies are at evidence lev-el III; in other words, they were trials without rigorous randomi-zation or they involved single group pre-post, cohort, time series,or matched case-control studies [3]. As a result, there are a num-ber of contradictory reports regarding the therapeutic effective-ness of TCM on the treatment of cancer.In TCM prescriptions, herbs are generally used in combination as'formulas ', in the belief that the combinations enhance their ben- efits and simultaneously reduce side effects. With proper diagno-sis and understanding of the component herbs, practitioners canadjust or customize the formulas to suit individual cancer pa-tients. Through synergistic interactions between different effec-tive ingredients, the herbal preparation, according to the clinicalexperiences, can exert its effects in several ways: (i) they can pro-tect the noncancerous cells and tissues in the body from the pos-sible damage caused by chemo/radiotherapy; (ii) they can en-hance the potency of chemo/radiotherapy; (iii) they can reduceinflammatory and infectious complications in the tissues sur-rounding the carcinoma; (iv) they can enhance immunity andbody resistance; (v) they can improve general condition andquality of life; and (vi) they can prolong the life span of the pa-tients in the late stages of cancer ( l \"Fig. 1 ). So, for an evaluation of the effect and benefit of TCM therapy for cancer patients, allof these above-mentioned aspects need to be considered. A typi-cal example of the synergistic, complex function of the herbs hasbeen given in the study of PHY906, a Chinese herbal preparationmade from from a classic herbal formula used for treatment of diarrhea and inflam-matory conditions. Based on the properties and functions of Chi-nese medicinal herbs, each formula has a principle herb and ad-juvant herbs. Here, the S. baicalensis acts as a ...Planta Med 2010; 76: 1118 -1131Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. while the rest of the herbs in the formula are assistant herbs. The phase I/IIA randomized clinical study of PHY906 demonstrated areduction of gastrointestinal toxicity and enhancement of the tu-moricidal effect of the chemotherapy in patients with advancedcolorectal cancer [4]. Recently, it has been also found effective inincreasing the therapeutic efficacy and reducing adverse effectsof the cytotoxic drug capecitabine in patients with advanced he-patocellular carcinoma in a phase I/II clinical study [5]. Furtheranimal study demonstrates that removing one or three herbsfrom the PHY906 formulation would dampen the effect ofPHY906 in antitumor activity, reduces toxicity, and reduces thebioavailability of the principle herb (personal communicationfrom Y.C. Cheng). Other than this, many studies have demon-strated that specific combinations of medicinal herbs can be syn-ergistic with cytotoxic chemotherapy through both pharmaco-dynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions. In a cohort study, acombined treatment of traditional Chinese medicine and West-ern medicine (WM) or treatment with WM alone was conductedon 222 patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer after radicaloperation. The survival of WM alone and the WM and TCM com-bined treatment is 16 months and 26.5 months, respectively, inwhich WM was administrated as the routine protocol while aTCM formula was given according to the treatment principle ofdifferentiation for symptom patterns [6].In the past decade, there have been a few systematic reviews re-garding the clinical trials against various cancers treated with aTCM formula. One systematic review on colorectal cancershowed that TCM therapy alone or in combination with chemo-therapy is useful during the postoperation period in relieving in-testinal obstruction, reducing postoperative ileus symptoms andurinary retention [7]. Another systematic review evaluating ran-domized clinical trails (RCT) of TCM oral therapy for hepatocellu-lar cancers found that many RCTs, although the herbs theystudied were effective, were not randomized [8]. With respectto non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although it is one of thecommon cancers with the highest death rate, there are few reli-able reports assessing TCM therapy. One RCT study done in Chinaanalyzing the survival time, Karnofsky score, clinical symptomsand adverse reactions shows that chemotherapy plus KangliuZengxiao Decoction (KLZXD) is able to prolong the survival timeof patients up to 15.57 months versus 11.17 months in the pa-tients treated with chemotherapy alone. The symptoms of fatigueand dyspnea and the adverse effects of leukopenia and dyspepsia caused by chemotherapy were reduced by treatment with KLZXD[9]. However, another study comparing the efficacy of TCM andchemotherapy against NSCLC found uncertain results. Neverthe-less, TCM treatment seems to stabilize the tumor mass, relieveclinical symptoms, and elevate quality of life. It is also inexpen-sive and more convenient compared with the conventional che-motherapy [10]. With regard to advanced breast cancer, theherbal preparation Shenqi Fuzheng Injection (SFI), was demon-strated to alleviate bone marrow inhibition and cellular immuni-ty suppression caused by chemotherapy, and to relieve clinicalsymptoms, raise the quality of life and prolong survival timecompared to patients receiving only chemotherapy [11]. Similar-ly, a systematic review on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) sug-gests that TCM therapy is efficacious as a concomitant therapy forNPC patients, but rigorous controlled clinical trials are still re-quired to confirm these results [12]. A report on TCM therapy forprogressive gastric cancer shows some benefits to the patient butthe study was not well designed, hence its conclusions are sus-pect [13]. Unfortunately, a systematic review on esophageal can-cer shows no evidence to support the effectiveness of TCM ther-apy [14]. Based on the above reports, the efficacy of TCM therapyin cancers is still unproven by the current RCT standards.Aside from the therapeutic effect of TCM therapy on suppressingcancer growth, other potential benefits to patients, such as en-hancement of organ functions, improvement of quality of life, re-duction of clinical symptoms including pain, and reduction of ad-verse effects of chemo-/radiotherapy are the indexes closely asso-ciated with the characteristics and advantages of TCM treatmentas a supplementary remedy to the conventional chemo-/radio-therapy and those indexes have not always been taken into con-sideration in assessing the therapeutic outcome of TCM in RCTevaluations. For instance, a review analyzing the effectiveness ofTCM for liver protection and chemotherapy completion amongcancer patients shows that although there is no significant differ-ence in outcome between the TCM-treated and the controlgroups, TCM therapy alongside the standard chemotherapy re-sulted in protection of liver function during the course of chemo-therapy, as manifested by lower serum AST and ALT levels [15].As we know, normal liver function is critical for successful com-pletion of a standard course of chemotherapy. Thus, protection ofliver function will not only protect the liver organ itself but willalso enhance the cytotoxic potency of chemotherapeutic drugs.A systematic review on huangqi decoction in alleviation of che-motherapy side effects in colorectal cancer patients was recentlyreported [16]. Despite the low quality of the clinical studies, theresults suggest that huangqi decoction may stimulate immuno-competent cells and decrease side effects in patients treated withchemotherapy. In addition to the alleviation of chemotherapyside effects, a reduction in cancer pain may also be a beneficialresult from TCM treatment according to a recent systematic re-views of 115 articles on clinical research in TCM treatment forcancer pain management [17].In recent years, improvement of quality of life and prolongationof survival time of cancer patients, whether the cancerous carci-noma disappears or not in the body, have become important fac-tors for evaluating the benefits of any intervention for cancer pa-tients. Another recent study evaluated the effect of the combinedGanji Recipe therapy with the Fructus Bruceae oil emulsion (FBE)intervention or the transhepatic arterial chemical embolization(TACE) on the quality of life and survival time of patients with ad-vanced primary hepatic cancer. The results showed significant Fig. 1 Schematic presentation of the actions of TCM as adjuvant cancer therapy based on the theory and clinical practice of TCM.1120 Hsiao WLW, Liu L.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. improvements in the quality of life and the life expectancy of the patients receiving Ganji and FBE treatment compared to patientstreated with oil emulsion interven-tion [18]. Studies on non-small cell lung cancer indicate thatTCM therapy is able to markedly reduce the adverse postradiationreactions and improve the quality of life of patients through in-tensive analysis study, the herbal preparationof Quxie Capsule was demonstrated to be effective in improvingsignificantly the quality of life and in prolonging the survival ofadvanced colorectal cancer patients in an RCT study [1]. Molecular Mechanisms of TCM-Based Herbal Medicines as Anticancer Drugs ! Proponents of Chinese traditional medicines point out that these medicines, unlike Western drugs in which the therapeutic effectsare derived from a single compound with a well-defined target,have synergistic pharmacological effects because each herbal for-mula consists of several herbs, each with specific therapeutic ac-tivities toward the disease or symptoms. Nonetheless, the major-ity of reports in the literature have taken a reductionist approach,namely working on mostly the TCM-derived pure compounds;few have studied extracts derived from a single herb, and veryfew have studied TCM formulations which are the form that havehistorically given the most benefit. At the time of this review,there were two comprehensive reviews published in 2003 onantitumor agents from TCM, focusing on both the chemical prop-erties and the mechanisms of action of those compounds [20,21].Therefore, this second part of the review will only touch upon afew studies in or before 2003, and will mainly cover reports after2003 that appeared in the databases, including Ovid MEDLINE \u00ae, medicines. l \"Table 1 summarizes the articles selected out of ~ 500 original works on anticancer herbal medicines that meetthe criteria mentioned above, i.e., (i) the article describes workon TCM-derived herbal medicine(s), and (ii) it is a mechanisticstudy at the molecular level. Due to the enormous volume of re-ports on apoptosis, this review in this area of study will mainlycover reports since 2006. In the review, we will also try to linkthe current understanding of anticancer TCM herbs based on theexperimental and clinical studies with the understanding of thefunctions of the herbs based on TCM theory and concepts as de-veloped during more than a thousand years of clinical experi-ences. Anticancer Effects and Underlying Mechanisms of TCM-Derived Compounds or Herbal Extracts ! The anticancer herbal drugs can be divided into three categories based on their target: (i) drugs that uniquely target topo-isomerases (Topos) and perturb DNA replication; (ii) drugs thatkill tumor through apoptotic pathways; and (iii) drugs thatalter signaling pathway(s) required for the maintenance of trans-forming phenotypes of the tumor cells. It is known that manynatural products extracted from medicinal herbs show a directkilling effect on tumor cells. There is no exception for the com-pounds isolated from various traditional Chinese medicinesclaimed to have anticancer effects. Drugs targeting topoisomer-ase I & II (Topo I & II) as well as on pro-apoptotic pathways are known to induce cell death. Camptotheca acuminata ( X iS h u )i sa TCM herb commonly used for cancer treatment in China. Thecompound camptothecin (CPT) isolated from the plant has beenfound to uniquely target Topo I, an enzyme which produces aDNA single-strand break in DNA replication. Interference ofTopo I induces apoptosis and cell cycle perturbations [22 -25]. This finding along with the discovery of natural product-derivedtaxol have been considered as historic achievements in naturalproducts and have subsequently led to the identification of a se-ries of TCM-derived compounds targeting Topo I & II ( l \"Table 1 ). Apoptosis is a common mode of action of chemotherapeuticagents, including the natural product-derived drugs [26,27]. Itappears that this is true for TCM-derived compounds and theirextracts. As shown in l \"Table 1 , 85 out of 104 independent stud- ies of herbal medicines derived from 62 different TCM-basedherbal plants revealed that apoptosis is the key mode for cell kill-ing in a wide variety of cancer cells upon the treatment with var-ious tested herbal medicines. For example, solanine, a steroid al-kaloid isolated from Solanum nigrum Linn. that is a TCM com- monly used in treating digestive system cancer, was found topossess anticancer effects and induce apoptosis mediated by theinhibition expression of Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic crude extract (ACCE), an extract ob- tained from a rare traditional Chinese herbal medicine Zhan-Ku(a camphor tree mushroom), has shown rather significant inhib-itory effects on the growth of various transitional cell carcinomas(TCC) including RT4, TSGH-8301, and T24 cell down-alteration of andsenescence in RT4 cells. On the other hand, ACCE at a low concen-tration simultaneously downregulated Cdc2 and Cyclin B1 withsuppression of the migrating capability of the two celllines TSGH-8301 and T24, and eventually caused cell death [29].The concentration-dependent cellular responses seem to providea new avenue to explore the anticancer effects of TCM, especiallyat nontoxic dosages. The dried root of Astragalus membranaceus (Huangqi) has a long history of medicinal use for immunodefi-ciency diseases and a relatively short history of equal effectivityfor alleviating the adverse effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. To-talAstragalus saponins induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in line HT-29 and the xenograft [30]. Artemisinin isthe Arti- misia annua L. an effective antimalaria drug. Later, studies showed that artemisinin and its derivatives have profound anti-cancer effects as assessed both in in vitro andin vivo models [31]. Artesunate, a derivative of artemisinin was found to inhibit an-giogenesis and induce apoptosis through p53-dependent and in-dependent component, berberine, were the most extensively studiedherb of the last decade. Berberine as well as Huanglian show di-verse biological activities, anti-inflam-matory, antiangiogenesis and activities A berberine directly targetsand modifies cysteine 179 of IkappaB kinase (IKK), leading to thedownregulation of NFkappaB and its series of target genes inanti-apoptosis, cell proliferation, inflammation and invasion [33].There are two major pathways by which chemotherapeuticagents can induce apoptosis of the treated cells. One is known asthe mitochondria-mediated pathway, which is activated by cyto-1121 Hsiao WLW, Liu L.

The caspase-3 then induces degradation of many signaling molecules, including a DNA repairmolecule and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and leads toirreversible cell death. The second pathway, the extrinsic recep-tor-mediated pathway involves death receptors, such as FAS,TNFR1 & R2, and TrailR. The latter pathway plays a major role in immune responses, but a lesser role in the response to geno-toxic stress. As shown in l \"Table 1 , there are only a small number of TCM-derived compounds that cause apoptosis via the extrinsicpathway. For example, matrine, an alkaloid purified from the Chi-nese herb Sophora flavescens Ait that is known as anticancer drug from TCM, activates in a gastric cancer cell line [34]. Tripto-lide is a purified component isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii that has been effective in treating a variety of inflammatory andautoimmune diseases. Tripolide also shows potent antitumorproperties [35]. A study has demonstrated that triptolide not on-ly XIAP, a potent cellular caspase inhibitor elevated inacute and a toTNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), but also acti- vates p53 signaling apoptosis of AMLs. In a sepa-rate study [36], tripolide was also found to overcome desmetha-sone-resistance and to enhance bortezomib/PS 341-induced ap- optosis. It is believed that tripolide acts through multiple signal-ing pathways, including the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappaB herb Peoinia moutan is a TCM herb used to activate blood flow and remove blood stasis. Treatment of mice with aseries of concentrations of paeonol induced apoptosis of theHepA-xenograft, and meanwhile caused elevation of blood IL-2and TNF- in the tumor-bearing mice [38]. Summarizing data from more than 80 independent research pa-pers, it appears that herbal medicines predominately affect apo-ptotic signaling molecules, including increasing the ratio of Bax/ Bcl-2, and upregulating caspases-3, 8,9 and p53/p21 signals. An intriguing observation is that the elevation of PARP-1 cleavageseems to be a common event in cancer cell lines upon the treat-ment of TCM drugs. It is known that the inhibition of PARP-1 canpotentiate both chemo- and radiotherapies for cancer and there-fore the search for inhibitor(s) against PARP-1 has been an activearea for the development of anticancer drugs [39]. Conversely,excessive expression of PARP-1 can cause translocation of the mi-tochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) to the nuclei, andcause PARP-1-dependent cell death.There are few herbs that do not cause apoptosis; instead, theseherbs (listed in l \"Table 1 ) generally induce antiangiogenesis, or induce differentiation and change the transforming phenotypesof the tumor cells as listed in l \"Table 1 . According to the TCM classification of medicinal herbs for cancer treatment, we haveclassified the herb plants listed in l \"Table 1 into six major classes and show them in l\"Table 2 . To sum up the above actions of the TCM-derived herbal compounds and herbal extracts, we havemapped the found molecular targets from l \"Table 1 to the known cellular signaling network shown in l\"Fig. 2 . This schematic dia- gram shows that PI3K/AKTS NF-kappaB are the common signaling pathways affected in respond-ing to the various treatments of TCM. The drawing also illustratesthat the caspase family members and the mitochondria-medi-ated apoptotic molecules might play a role in the anticancer ef-fects of the herbal medicines. However, the information collectedup to the time of this review can only offer a rough and incom-plete picture of the action of TCM herbal medicines. Further sys-temic studies are needed for a true and comprehensive under-standing of the nature of the TCM products in cancer preventionand treatment.Table 1 Examples of anticancer compounds or extracts derived from traditional Chinese herbal medicines with known molecular mechanism of action. continued Affected molecules and pathways In vitro and/or in vivo systemMain TCM herbs Active component* Type of compound Ref. \"Bcl-2; Fas ligand and receptor lung carcinoma inhibition; : induction; * Chemical structures of the active components are shown in l\"Fig. 3 ;#Aloe vera (15 g), Angelica sinensis (30 g), Scutellaria baicalensis (30 g); Classification of medicinal herbs based on the properties and actions of Chinese medicinal herbs (see l\"Table 2 for details):1Medicine for heat clearance and detoxification;2Medicinal for promoting blood circulation and eliminating stasis;3Medicinal for strengthening qi;4Medicinal for resolving phlegm and removing stasis;5Medicinal with cytotoxic function;6Medicinal for dispersing edema and relieving pain;7Others1124 Hsiao WLW, The Role of ...Planta Med 2010; 76: 1118 -1131Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Anticancer Effects and Underlying Mechanisms of TCM-Derived Complex Formulas ! There are only a few mechanistic studies on the action of TCM formulas as anticancer agents. One study was on San-Zhong-Kui-Jian-Tang (SZKJT) [40], a complex formula comprising 17 dif-ferent herbs, that is used for cancer therapy in China. SZKJT wasfound to induce the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway ratios, cytochrome c release activa-tion, but not act on Fas/Fas ligand pathways two humanbreast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA MB-231. A similar study was carried out by the same laboratory [41] on huang-lian-jie-du-tang (HLJDT) known to possess anti-inflammatory activity.Thein vitro study conducted in two human liver cancer cell lines, HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5, found that HLJDT caused cell arrest by up-regulating the inactive form of Cdc2 and Cdc25, and levels of Bcl-2 and Furthermore, in-creased the ratio of Bax Bak/Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and the associ-ated cell survival pathways, and subsequently triggered the mito-chondrial apoptotic pathway. It was the collective actions of theherbs in the formula that were inhibiting the growth of cancercells tested both in vitro cell lines and in vivo in nude mice. An- other study is the study of a classic formula, Guizhi-fuling decoc-tion (GZFLD) [42]. GZFLD inhibited the growth of HeLa cells by activating the tissue inhibitor of metallopepti-dases (TIMPs) and causing the suppression of the activity of thematrix metallopeptidase (MMPs) that play a key role in the deg-radation of the extracellular matrix and promotion of cell prolif-eration. In the same study, GZFLD was also shown to inhibit tu-mor growth and angiogenesis in an in vivo animal model. Anoth- er report [43] concerned a BJBDT demonstrated antiangiogenesis by blocking VEGF/VEGFR activ-ities in human umbilical vein endothelial Interestingly,BJBDT can prevent cisplatin-induced toxicity and in MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 breast can-cer cells, suggesting the herbal formula can be applied as a cancerchemopreventive agent [43]. The synergistic effects of herbs in aTCM formula were well illustrated in a recent study, in which aTCM-based formula, Realgar-indigo naturalis (RIF), was appliedin the treatment of acute promyelocytic (APL). The RIFformula has three components, realgar, indigo naturalis, and Sal- Fig. 2 The altered protein molecules (shown in l\"Table 1 ) upon treatments of TCM herbal medicines and the associated cellular signaling networks.1126 Hsiao WLW, Liu L.

The study demonstrated that tetraarsenic tetrasulfide isthe principle component of the formula, while tanshinone IIAand indirubin are the adjuvant ingredients. Together these herbshave shown a synergistic action against APL effective in both in vitro and clinical studies. Future Prospect of TCM Herbal Medicines in Cancer Research ! The cellular and animal studies have provided strong molecular evidences for the anticancer activities of the TCM herbal medi-cines, tested as pure compounds or as crude extracts of the singleherbs or the complex formulas. However, several importantquestions remain to be answered. Do TCM-derived herbal medi-cines possess any special effects other than those often seen withconventional drugs for cancer treatment? There has been littleinvestigation to make a side-by-side comparison. An earlier workwas conducted on the anticancer effects protodioscine (glyco-sides) from the rhizome of Dioscorea collettii var.hypoglauca ,a Chinese herbal remedy for the treatment of cervical carcinoma,carcinoma of urinary bladder and renal tumor for centuries,against a 60 NCI human cancer panel [47], and it was found tobe specifically effective for cervical carcinoma, bladder and renalcancer cell lines. Moreover, based on an analysis of the COMPAREcomputer program with protodioscin as a seed compound, noother compounds in the NCI s anticancer drug screen database have a cytotoxicity pattern (mean graphs) similar to those of pro-todioscin, indicating that a potential novel mechanism of anti-cancer action is involved. This may be one of many methods bywhich the unique properties of TCM can be revealed in a concisemanner.The other question to be addressed in the future is whether themethodologies and the in vitro andin vivo biological models cur- rently employed to investigate the therapeutic nature of tradi-tional Chinese medicines are good enough. In this review, thereare 66 herbs that have been used for anticancer studies. We havegrouped these herbal plants into seven functional groups basedon the traditional usage for cancer treatment ( l \"Table 2 ). Inter- estingly only a small subset of herbs is considered toxic, groupedunder the category of \"medicinal with cytotoxic function \",t h e majority is not. On the other hand, the majority of TCM-derivedcomponents shown above are in the same category as the con-ventional anticancer drugs which induce apoptosis. In a previousstudy [48], we used a cell system by which the inhibitory effectsof non-cytotoxic chemicals were assessed by a focus formationassay upon transfection of rasoncogene to the host cells. Using this system, two well-studied medicinal mushrooms Ganoderma lucidum andTricholoma lobayense with anticancer potential were examined for their possible adverse effects on cell transformationinduced by rasoncogene. The results indicated that both species of mushrooms strongly inhibited ras-induced cell transforma- tion. However, the inhibitory effect of the mushroom extractswas not due to a direct killing of the transformed cells; rather, itseems to have been mediated through the surrounding normalcells. This normal cell-dependent growth inhibitory effect is alsoobserved with oleanolic acid isolated from Oldenlandia diffusa [49]. These examples suggest that, at least some, TCM medicinesexert their anticancer effects through mechanism(s) other thanapoptosis.Looking forward, we see three specific issues that will require fo-cused attention: (i) more well-designed clinical trials are re-quired to support the effectiveness and the safety of TCM in themanagement of cancers; (ii) new parameters based on the uniqueproperties and theory of TCM are needed to assess the clinical ef- Fig. 3 Chemical structures of the TCM-derived active components shown inl\"Table 1 .1127 Hsiao WLW, Liu The Role of ...Planta Med 2010; 76: 1118 -1131Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

There is evidence that thereductionist approach, i.e., searching for one or a few active in-gredients in an herb or formula, may not elucidate the efficacyof herbal medicines; a systems biology approach may be moreappropriate and productive, in terms of developing effectivetreatment protocols.Undoubtedly, the evaluation of the therapeutic effects and thebenefits of TCM therapy for cancer patients is a significantly com-plex, albeit significant, issue. TCM therapy, based on multiple me-dicinal herbs and an holistic approach to diagnosis as well astreatment, means that a clinical study of TCM treatment is moredifficult and complicated than the study of single compounddrugs. In addition to the conventional \"standards \"used for WM clinical trail, there is a need to develop a set of parameters thatare suitable to the assessment of TCM therapy. The effects, as wellas the toxicity, of individual herbs or, especially, of single com-pounds derived from the herb cannot completely reflect the ben-efits and toxicity of the herbal combination. When whole herbsare not studied, improper or biased results and conclusionsmight be unavoidable [50]. As a goal, to develop TCM into rationalcancer therapy, more well-designed intensive clinical evaluationsand translational laboratory studies are absolutely needed. And,close collaboration between TCM and conventional Westernmedicine professions and a combination of TCM with modernmultidisciplinary cutting-edge technologies, such as omic meth-odology on systems biology [51], would provide us with an at-tractive and effective strategy to achieve this goal.
