Come treat your body to a full body detox session with the most soothing heat. Imagine stepping inside a private oasis where you can stretch out and let the light infuse your mind, body and soul with comfort. As you relax, far infrared energy increases sweat production releasing harmful toxins from the body. Unlike traditional saunas which use hot air to heat the body from the outside, infrared heats the body by penetrating from the inside out. The temperature of a traditional sauna is typically between 150 and 185 F vs the temperature in an infrared sauna, usually between 120-145F. This beneficial heat prompts the heart to work harder to pump blood at a greater rate to raise the body core temperature. The boost in circulation increases your metabolism as you burn up to 600 calories during your session. Weight loss is easy, comfortable and relaxing with Detox Youth. Relieve pain, burn calories and relax today at one of the 11 locations below. "}
