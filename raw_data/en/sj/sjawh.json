Vitamin IV Therapy FAQs Q: What should I expect from Vitamin IV Therapy? A: Vitamin IV Therapy helps deliver minerals and amino acids to your body for maximum absorption. If you continuously use Vitamin IV Therapy, you are proactively maintaining optimum wellness. Q: How does Vitamin IV Therapy Work? A: Much like oral supplements, Vitamin IV Therapy focuses on providing your body with vitamins and nutrients. However, our body only absorbs 20% of the nutrients in oral supplements-the rest are filtered by our digestive system. With Vitamin IV Therapy, nutrients are administered directly into your bloodstream, bypassing your digestive system. The result is 100% cell absorption. Q: Does Vitamin IV Therapy hurt? A: You will feel a slight pinch as the needle enters your vein, then a cool rush as the fluids enter your body. Q: How long does one Vitamin IV Therapy session take? A: A 500ml Vitamin IV Therapy requires 30-45 minutes and a one-litre therapy requires 45-60 minutes. "}
