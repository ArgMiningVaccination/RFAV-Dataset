However, late fall and winter, commonly dubbed \"cold and flu season,\" provides an extra reason to keep your immune system in tip-top shape! Once a pathogen is able enter the body, it's up to your body's cells to protect you. Acupuncture helps these disease-fighting cells to work their best and protect you from illness. Acupuncture is proven to increase the amount of your body's immune cells, such as the red blood cells, white blood cells, and T-cells. Your immune system relies on your body's overall health to maintain its effectiveness. Poor nutrition and stress both increase your risk of getting sick. Especially during winter, when your body is handling the cold weather, the busy nature of the holidays, and the surplus of sweet treats, it's easy to see how this time of year is known as 'cold and flu season' The Traditional Chinese Medical diagnosis for these pathogenic invasions almost always involve the presence of Wind. In Chinese Medicine, Wind is capable of invading the body through the channels, mostly at the nape of the neck. Wind may look like a rash, body aches, chill, or itchiness. One of the most important and easiest things you can do for your health in the winter is always protect your neck from wind and cold. Featured Product: Yu Ping Feng San Yu ping feng san, or \"Jade Windscreen,\" has been used in East Asia for over 800 years, with records dating back to the writings of the scholar Zhu Dan Xi in 1347. As its name illustrates, the Jade Windscreen formula supports and enriches the Wei Qi, or protective Qi, in guarding against harmful influences entering the body. Three main ingredients: Huang Qi: Astragalus root- common western herb for augmenting the immune system, excellent for strengthening the spleen and the lungs. Bai Zhu: Atractylodes- dries dampness (congestion), and strengthens the spleen. Fang Feng: Siler root- releases the exterior (where wind resides) and clears wind. I look forward to seeing you on my Acupuncture table this winter to support your body's immune system and help keep you healthy throughout the winter.
