If you're vomiting or have diarrhea, drink Pedialyte, Body Armor, or Nourish to replenish electrolytes. Another good option is a quality chicken or beef bone broth or vegetable broth. Eat clean protein. The virus attacks and destroys protein, so you need to replace it. Eliminate sugar - the virus feeds on sugar, so avoid sugar or starchy foods that turn to sugar. Also eat clean greens and leafy vegetables. This helps fight the virus. Move - do not stay reclined in bed except for the time you are sleeping at night. Do not sit for too long. Stay upright as much as possible and walk. This keeps the fluid from accumulating in the lungs. You risk pneumonia if you stay immobile or recline for too long. Go outside and walk in nature. Keep active even if you are feeling better. Your lungs are very fragile when infected by this virus. Treat them kindly. Avoid aerosol sprays (Lysol, air fresheners) or fragrance plug ins. The surface virus is easily killed with dish soap and water so you do not need to use disinfecting sprays. Avoid smoking or vaping, since that damages the lung tissue. Replace air conditioning filters. They can trap viruses and pollutants in them. Use your pulse oximeter regularly. Your oxygen level should be in the 90's. Practice taking slow, deep breaths to help oxygenate your blood. If your oxygen is approaching 90, please call, go to a medical clinic, or the ER to get oxygen. Think positively. Good endorphins help you beat this virus! - Supplements Zinc - Zinc enters your cells and prevents replication of the virus. Women should take 6-12.5 mg daily and men should take 12-25 mg daily Quercetin - quercetin helps the zinc penetrate the cells - 500 mg per day Vitamin C - Anti-inflammatory and immune boosting - 600-800 mg daily Vitamin D - Immune boosting - 2000 IU's daily Multi Vitamin - soft gel Pepto Bismol liquid - If you experience vomiting, diarrhea, or acid stomach, take some liquid Pepto Bismol (it doesn't taste as bad as it used to!) - it coats the esophagus and stomach, giving you some relief from symptoms. Two doses now and another in 8-12 hours if needed. "}
