Design Case report of postoperative programme. Participant Fifty-six-year-old male with rotator cuff tear. Intervention The protocol was delivered in three phases: Phase I, passive range of motion for 6 weeks following surgery; Phase II, active assisted exercise for Weeks 6-8; and Phase III, resisted exercise for Weeks 8-12. Main outcome measures University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) pain and function scores, active arm elevation and isometric shoulder rotation strength were measured before surgery and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Results Full activity without pain was reported 6 months following surgery (UCLA score 10), with active elevation and rotation strength comparable to the unaffected shoulder. Conclusion Further work is now required to validate the effectiveness of the treatment protocol. |Original language||English (US)| |Pages (from-to)||217-220| |Number of pages||4| |Journal| Keywords - Outcome measure - Shoulder - Therapy "}
