Following the demerger of our Consumer Healthcare business to form Haleon in July, we are now a fully-focused biopharma company. All data reported excludes our previous Consumer Healthcare business unless otherwise specified.Being a responsible business means getting ahead of disease together in the right way. We therefore need to consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts across everything we do, from the lab to the patient. That's why ESG is embedded in our strategy and supports our sustainable performance and long-term growth. It helps us build trust with and deliver returns to our stakeholders, reduce risk to our operations and deliver positive social impact. In this report In this report we publish our performance on each of our six ESG focus areas. The report includes our reporting on the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). We also submit an annual UN Global Compact Communication on Progress (UNGC CoP). You can find our public positions on a range of issues on the public policy page of gsk.com.

We are a company where outstanding people can thrive. External benchmarking Detailed below is how we perform in key ESG ratings that we are frequently asked about by investors: -Access to Medicine s: Ranked 1st in the Access to Medicines Index in 2022 and an industry leader in the 2021 AntimicrobialResistance Benchmark -S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment: Ranked 2nd in the pharmaceuticals industry with a score of 86 (as at 1 7 February 2023) and included in the DJSI World and E urope indices-FTSE4Goo d: Member of FTSE4Good Index since 2004 -CDP: A- in Climate change, B in Water security, A- in Forests (palm oil) and B in Forests (timber) -Sustainalytic s: Low risk rating -MSCI : AA rating -Moody's ESG solution s: Ranked 2nd in the Ra B+ rating3 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023GSK's purpose is to unite science, technology and talent, and to get ahead of disease together. We have made building Trust by operating responsibly an integral part of our strategy and our culture. Ultimately, to support returns to shareholders, reduce risk, help our people to thrive, and to deliver sustainable health impact at scale. Our ESG focus is on six core areas: Access to healthcare, Global health and health security, Environment, Diversity, equity and inclusion, Ethical standards and Product governance. These areas address what matters most to our business and to our stakeholders. They are where we can have the greatest positive impact on some of society's most urgent challenges. This sets out the progress we are making in each area and supplements our Annual Report. We hope this information and level of transparency is helpful, particularly for investors. To strengthen measurement and reporting of GSK's overall ESG performance, this year we have introduced a new ESG Performance Rating. This new rating is one of our corporate KPIs and measures progress against key metrics aligned to each of our six focus areas. In 2022, this included 23 metrics, developed with stakeholder input, each of which were assessed and aggregated to a single overall performance score. I am pleased to report that GSK's performance in 2022 is 'on track' and more details can be found on pages 5 to 6. Included in our 2022 performance was strong progress on: -Vaccine and medicines access initiatives reaching 73 million people in lower income countries -Progressed 12 Global Health pipeline assets for priority WHO diseases including malaria and TB -30 R&D projects relevant to AMR with 13 targeting pathogens deemed 'critical' or 'urgent' by WHO and US CDC -All phase III trials started in 2022 had a diversity plan to enrol those most affected by the disease being studied -Improvement in gender and ethnicity representation in our leadership -13% reduction in our indirect carbon emissions from 2020 to 2021 (our latest available scope 3 data) -Delivery of our 2030 target to reduce water use in operations by 20% -100% of employees completing mandatory training Our ESG performance continues to be recognised. We ranked 1st in the Access to Medicines Index for the 8th consecutive time, ranked 2nd in the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment for the pharmaceutical industry, and maintained top-quartile positions in the MSCI, ISS Corporate Rating and Sustainalytics ESG ratings. While proud of our progress, we keep our approach to ESG under constant review. Being a responsible business is not a static requirement and our operating environment continues to change at pace. We will continue to adapt, respond and proactively change our approach, to ensure GSK continues to deliver strong ESG performance alongside the broader performance of the company. Emma Walmsley Chief Executive OfficerCEO's statement We are pleased to provide this report of our ESG performance for 2022. 4 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Our approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix Our six ESG focus areas We can only deliver on our purpose and build trust if we embed ESG into everything that we do. We have identified six ESG focus areas that address what is most material to our business and the issues that matter the most to our stakeholders. These focus areas are core to our strategy and are the areas where we can have the greatest positive impact on some of society's most urgent challenges. These focus areas are: -Access to healthcare -Global health and health security -Environment -Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) -Ethical standards -Product governance Our approach is guided by extensive stakeholder engagement and the key issues relevant to our industry and company. The results of our most recent materiality assessment reaffirmed that the most material issues for our business were well aligned with our six ESG focus areas. We are aware, however, that being a responsible business is not a static requirement and our operating environment continues to change at pace. We will continue to adapt, respond and proactively change our approach, to ensure GSK continues to deliver strong ESG performance. gsk.com: Materiality assessmentESG governance Our ESG performance is monitored regularly by both our Board- level Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) and the GSK Leadership Team (GLT). The CRC oversees our progress against our commitments, including performance and how we are meeting the expectations of our stakeholders. The GLT and senior management are responsible for delivery against our six focus areas, and report regularly to the CRC on progress (see pages 117 to 118 of our Annual Report). ESG-aligned remuneration In 2022, the Remuneration Committee, with the support of the CRC, introduced ESG performance measures into both our short- and long-term incentive plans, to reward delivery of key ESG commitments. The ESG element consists of: human capital management in the form of diversity, equity and inclusion, which forms 10% of the annual bonus opportunity for GLT; and our climate net zero and nature net positive ambitions, which form 10% of our long-term incentive plan opportunity for senior leaders. These metrics align to our ESG Performance Rating. See Annual Report page 133 for further information. Our approach ESG is an integral part of our strategy and our purpose. It impacts everything we do, from the lab to the patient. Our ESG Performance Rating To support the integration of ESG into strategy delivery and to make our ESG performance measurable and verifiable, we have introduced a new ESG Performance Rating. The rating is one of our corporate KPIs and measures progress against key metrics aligned to each of our six focus areas. In 2022, this included 23 metrics which are summarised on pages 5 to 6. The metrics were developed with stakeholder input, and our understanding of the key issues for our industry and our company. We are committed to ensuring that our ESG Performance Rating responds to stakeholder expectations, so we will continue to review the metrics as our business, and external expectations, change. To create the ESG Performance Rating, management sought metrics that: -Are well defined to ensure we have a standardised approach -Can be used consistently in future years -Are ambitious and achievable -Can be externally assured -Are meaningful for stakeholdersHow we assess performance GLT is accountable for delivering progress against the metrics and regularly reviews performance along with the Board's CRC. Each individual metric is assessed as either: on track (metric met or exceeded); on track with work to do (at least 80% of metric has been achieved); or off track (metric missed by more than 20%). In addition, in order to calculate the overall ESG Performance Rating, performance across all metrics is aggregated to a single score to illustrate whether we are on track, on track with work to do, or off track. This rating is defined below: On track: 70% of all metrics are on track On track with work to do: more than 50% of all metrics are either on track, or on track with work to do Off track: more than 50% of all metrics are off track5 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Our approach continuedOur approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix Our ESG focus areas Our six commitments and 23 metrics 2022 performance Access Read more on page 9Make our products available at value-based prices that are sustainable for our business and implement access strategies that increase the use of our medicines and vaccines to treat and protect underserved people Performance metrics: -Develop and externally publish pricing and access principles -Progress towards our 2030 goal of reaching 1.3 billion people in lower income countries with our productsHighlights and focus areas: -Published pricing and access principles to guide our approach to responsible pricing -In 2022, we reached 73 million people with our products and supplied an additional 533 million doses of albendazole 1 Global health and health security Read more on page 13Develop novel products and technologies to treat and prevent priority diseases, including pandemic threats Performance metrics: -Progress three Global Health pipeline assets to address priority WHO diseasesHighlights and focus areas: -Progressed 12 Global Health pipeline assets to address priority WHO diseases, including malaria and tuberculosis (TB) -Positive phase IIa study results for a new first-in-class candidate medicine for patients with TB -The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration approved the use of single-dose tafenoquine in children aged two and above in combination with chloroquine for the radical cure of P. vivax malaria -The FDA approved Triumeq PD - increasing age- appropriate treatment options for children living with HIV Environment Read more on page 16Commit to a net zero, nature positive, healthier planet with ambitious goals set for 2030 and 2045 Performance metrics: -Climate -Operational emissions reduction and 2 market-based emissions)2 -Industrialisation of green Ventolin initiated, and clinical and non-clinical data available to support regulatory submissions -Percentage of carbon offset volume in project pipeline3 -Water -Average of the percentage of GSK sites and suppliers compliant with wastewater active pharmaceutical ingredient limits and the percentage of suppliers that are compliant with the AMR Industry Alliance Common Antibiotic Manufacturing Framework and discharge limits -Waste and materials -Operational waste and material reduction at our sites -Biodiversity -Number of high-risk materials implementing sustainable sourcing roadmapsHighlights and focus areas: -Reduced our scope 1 and 2 carbon operational emissions by 6% from 2021 -Reduced our scope 3 value chain emissions by 13% since 2020 -Made good progress towards reformulating Ventolin , which could reduce the climate impact of our metered dose inhalers by up to 90%, if the clinical trials are successful -94% of GSK sites and suppliers are compliant with wastewater discharge limits -100% of our sites are now good water stewards, in line with the Alliance for Water Stewardship's definition -We achieved our target of reducing our overall water use by 20% by 2030 against our 2020 baseline and will now review our target -Completed baseline biodiversity assessments for 80% of our sites -12 high-risk materials implementing sustainable sourcing roadmaps2022 ESG Performance Rating Our 2022 ESG Performance Rating is on track , based on 83% of all performance metrics being met or exceeded.

Additionally, we focused on closure of cases, resulting in a decrease in open cases at year end compared to prior years with a correlation to rising numbers of employees who were dismissed or agreed to leave the company voluntarily as a result of misconduct.7 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Our approach continuedOur approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix Putting our people at the heart of our success Our culture We are committed to making GSK a place where people can thrive, with a culture where we are all ambitious for patients, accountable for impact, and do the right thing. This means we support our people to do things better and faster, focusing on what matters most. It means setting clear objectives and accountability for results and giving everyone the support and space they need to succeed. It means doing everything responsibly with care and integrity, because people and patients around the world count on us. During 2022, we have dedicated significant leadership energy in bringing to life our Ahead Together purpose, strategy and culture across GSK. We have also placed real emphasis on individual ownership of the culture and the small changes we each need to make it a reality. This change has been supported by team conversation guides and simple tools used globally to support better and faster decision making, greater clarity of accountabilities and more ambitious, focused objectives. In June 2022, we introduced The Code . This sets out our culture as well as the commitments GSK and our people make so we can deliver on our ambition in the right way. GSK people sign up to The Code annually and personally commit 'I'm in' . gsk.com: The Code Making GSK a place where people thrive Core to our Ahead Together ambition is to make GSK a place where people thrive. Although how people thrive is very individual, we also believe there are common themes that matter for all. Firstly, a belief in our purpose and a desire to live our culture and contribute to delivering our ambition. Secondly, feeling included and able to be yourself with opportunities to keep growing, with the support, feedback and space needed to succeed. Finally, feeling good, with positive mental, physical, financial and social wellbeing. This all requires GSK to be a place where people feel welcome and valued, with an environment (including our policies, workplaces and ways of working) which wholeheartedly enables and supports each person to deliver at their best. Supporting our people managers Our people managers play a crucial role in helping their teams to thrive and bring culture to life. We expect people managers to Motivate, Focus, Care for and Develop their teams. Over the last two years we have delivered First Line Leader training, anchored in these four areas, to over 80% of this population. In addition, in 2022, we launched a new senior leader programme, 'Leading Leaders', to further build on our leadership development at more senior levels of the organisation. In preparation for 2023, we brought all people managers together in a virtual event to bring to life our biggest priorities and support managers in setting focused, ambitious objectives with their teams, aligned to our Innovation, Performance, Trust and Culture priorities. Focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion We are continuing our focus on building a more diverse organisation and an equitable and inclusive culture so that everyone feels welcome, valued and included. We are delivering our leadership representation aspirations, have implemented annual DEI training for all, and invested in development tools to build more inclusive leaders. We support an award-winning leadership development programme, 'Accelerating Difference', to support women and ethnically diverse leaders. We have also continued to evolve our people policies, processes and practices to support recruitment, retention and development of a more diverse workforce. More details on our aspirational targets for DEI for our people, business and suppliers, can be found on page 23. Driving Performance with Choice Performance with Choice - our approach to hybrid working for those in office-based roles (about a quarter of our people) continues to allow us to find the right balance of on-site and remote working. This framework, balanced in driving collective and individual performance, as well as supporting individual flexibility, is supporting personal wellbeing, driving performance and making us attractive as an employer. This year we have been clear in our expectations so that we spend enough time together in person to help us continue to build our sense of community, connectedness, enable development and better achieve our Ahead Together ambition. Developing outstanding people We are committed to developing outstanding people and giving people opportunities to grow. All GSK people are expected to have an agreed development plan, regardless of grade or role, that is underpinned by a robust conversation to understand the space and support needed for them to succeed. We continue to invest in development initiatives and training that can be accessed by all through our Keep Growing Campus - a central platform for our training and knowledge sharing. In 2022, we have also redesigned our talent framework - focusing our reviews for our people against performance, living our culture and future potential. This gives us a simpler assessment process, in line with our culture, to support placing our best people in our most critical roles, with strong and diverse succession plans. This allows us to spend more time on development and action planning and less on process. 8 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Our approach continuedOur approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix Health and wellbeing improvements We have announced improvements to our health and wellbeing benefits, to better support people through different life stages and to make sure our offerings are fair and inclusive. These include a new global minimum standard of 18 weeks' parental leave for primary and secondary carers for all forms of family, a new global minimum standard for care of a family member for end of life or serious health emergencies, insured benefits to include same sex partners wherever possible, a new financial wellbeing service and mental health training - available to everyone. In November 2022, we gave a one-time discretionary payment to our people who were feeling the greatest impact of rising cost-of-living challenges. This payment was given to almost half of our global workforce in 47 of our 83 countries, using consistent criteria to determine eligible countries. Understanding how our people experience GSK We regularly measure how our people experience GSK, including progress in our culture focus areas and as a place to work. This includes an annual survey for all employees featuring questions on engagement, confidence, inclusivity, our culture focus areas and trust priorities. We also run a series of pulse surveys each year, with a statistically significant population, to get timely insights on our culture progress as well as hot topics of the moment. Over the last year, our progress is demonstrated by increased engagement at 81% in 2022, up from 78% in 2021, confidence in delivery of our ambitions, and positive trends in Ambitions for Patients, Accountability for Impact, Doing the Right Thing, and measures of inclusion. To measure the effectiveness of our global manager population, their teams provide feedback via an annual One80 survey. Managers receive anonymised aggregate feedback on their effectiveness in motivating their team, focusing people on what matters most, leading with care, inclusive leadership and supporting performance and development. In 2022, 77% of our managers were rated as highly effective by their reports. Recognising and rewarding our people Sharing our success and recognising and rewarding our people, not just on the progress we have made but how we have made it, continues to be an important part of our culture. In addition to our bonus scheme that rewards performance across the company, each year we award 10% of our population with extra 'Ahead Together' awards for those delivering exceptional performance in line with our culture. 5% of people are identified as Missed Performance for those that do not deliver on their objectives or live the culture. This year, in addition to our annual bonus and long-term incentive structure, we also gave a special thank you to all our people (excluding GLT), allowing us to recognise in real time what we achieved together in preparation for separation and the unprecedented transformation of GSK: everyone received a one-off week's salary in March, separate to our 2021 bonus pay-out. We remain energised to continually live and evolve our culture in line with the internal and external environment. It is part of everyone's objectives, starting at the top, with all leadership team members having ambitious goals to embed and grow culture, and shows up in how we act every day.9 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023We aim to make our vaccines and medicines available at responsible prices that are accessible for patients and sustainable for our business, while making sure underserved people are treated and protected through our access strategies. In recognition of the action we are taking to get ahead of disease together, in 2022, we ranked first in the Access to Medicines Index for the eighth consecutive time.The discovery and development of medicines and vaccines is complex and takes significant time, risk and investment to succeed. We follow a set of pricing and access principles , published for the first time in 2022. These help us to get the balance right between responsible pricing and a sustainable, profitable business that allows us to re-invest financial returns in future innovation, while ensuring people can access medicines and vaccines. gsk.com: Position on pricing and access Pricing and access principlesAccess Our ambition is to positively impact the health of 2.5 billion people by the end of 2030. We will achieve this by developing vaccines and medicines and making them available through responsible pricing, strategic access programmes and partnerships. Our commitment Make our products available at value-based prices that are sustainable for our business and implement access strategies that increase the use of our medicines and vaccines to treat and protect underserved peopleHow we assess performance -Develop and externally publish pricing and access principles -Progress towards our 2030 goal of reaching 1.3 billion people in lower income countries with our products>1bn vaccines supplied at our lowest prices to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, since 2010123 countries covered by ViiV Healthcare's paediatric voluntary licensing agreements with generic manufacturers73m people reached in lower income countries with our products in 2022 1 Putting the right value on innovation We pursue areas of unmet medical need, deploying cutting-edge science and advanced technology to develop more effective medicines and vaccines with speed, scale and precision. We compare our offer to what is already available for patients, and we generate evidence from clinical trials and real-world settings to establish the added value of our medicines and vaccines. These principles ensure we set prices across our portfolio in line with the benefit we bring to patients and health systems, measured by clinical, economic and social outcomes. We take into consideration the socioeconomic status of a country to ensure affordability and availability of products, including using tiered pricing based on World Bank income classification for vaccine tenders. We collaborate with global health partners to increase our impact in lower income countries, for example by supplying vaccine doses at our lowest prices with Gavi, the international alliance to improve access to vaccines for countries with the lowest GDP. ViiV Healthcare provides non-profit pricing to public health systems in low-income, least developed and sub-Saharan African countries for antiretroviral medicines to treat people living with HIV as well as for innovation to prevent HIV transmission. We also recognise health inequities, including in higher income countries, and help uninsured and underinsured patients navigate healthcare systems with programmes to increase access and provide financial and disease management support. For example, in 2022, in the US, through GSK and ViiV Healthcare's Patient Assistance Programs Foundation, we provided prescribed medicines and vaccines to more than 78,000 low-income uninsured, underinsured and Medicare Part D patients. In the US, during the year, our combined average net price (after discounts, rebates or other allowances) for our pharmaceutical and vaccines portfolio increased by 1.4%, while the average list price increased by 3.8% compared to 4.9% (list) for the industry, which demonstrates we are responsible in our pricing decisions 2. Over the past five years, the average net price for our products decreased by 1.1% annually, while the average list price rose by 3.9% compared to 5.0% (list) for the industry 2. We operate under robust pricing approvals, developing access plans that are informed by payers. We also work to create stability and predictability for payers and our business, engaging proactively on upcoming product launches so we can plan budgets, and adjusting prices to account for inflation.Our approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix 1 T he 73 million figure includes people reached Synflorix , Rotarix , Cervarix , OPV and people with access to a generic dolutegravir product through our voluntary licensing agreements; however it does not include people reached through albendazole, for which an assessment will be made in 2025 by the WHO and GSK. 2 I ndustry averages are sourced from Drug Channels annual brand-name drug list change report.10 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Reaching patients in lower income countries We are ambitious for our patients and develop access strategies where we can make a real difference. Nearly two billion people globally lack access to essential medicines and vaccines that could prevent and treat diseases, relieve suffering, improve quality of life and prevent deaths. Our goal is to reach 1.3 billion people in lower income countries with our products by the end of 2030, through access initiatives such as voluntary licensing, donations and our work with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. In 2022, we reached 73 million people with our products and supplied an additional 533 million doses of albendazole. For decades, we have worked with partners to strengthen healthcare systems, which is key to increasing access to medicines in lower income countries. We partner with others who have the right capability, geographic reach and local knowledge to get our innovation to patients. For medicines in low-income countries, we do not file patents for our medicines or enforce historic patents. This lets other companies manufacture and supply generic versions of GSK medicines in those countries. Vaccines It has never been more important to work with organisations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, that can help us reach the most vulnerable people. The pressure placed on healthcare systems in lower income countries by the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a reduction in routine immunisations, putting millions of children's health at risk. We have been a partner with Gavi since its foundation in 2000. We reserve our lowest vaccine prices for Gavi and similar organisations. In 2022, we passed the milestone of supplying Gavi with more than one billion vaccines since 2010. Our partnership includes supplying Cervarix , a critical vaccine in lower income countries for addressing cervical cancer. In 2022, we supplied around 40 million doses of our pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix , to eight Gavi-eligible countries at our lowest price. Our Rotarix vaccine against rotavirus reaches children across 28 Gavi-eligible countries and four former Gavi countries. Since March 2021, as well as Synflorix , we have also offered Rotarix through the Humanitarian Mechanism, to civil society organisations serving refugees and working in other emergency situations. We are also a long-standing supplier of oral polio vaccines (OPV) through UNICEF and, in 2022 alone, supplied around 95 million doses to help eradicate polio. Neglected tropical diseases Since 1999, we have donated 11 billion albendazole tablets to the WHO, including 533 million in 2022. This supports efforts to end lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, and reduce morbidity from intestinal worms (soil-transmitted helminths) in school-age children. We have also extended our soil-transmitted helminths commitment to include pre-school children and made an additional commitment to donate albendazole for treatment of echinococcosis. According to the latest data from the WHO, this has benefited over 935 million people since the programme began. In 2021, 365 million people were treated through the lymphatic filariasis programme in 28 countries, including 118 million children.HIV Supporting the production of generic drugs can also improve access. In 2022, ViiV Healthcare and the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) signed a new voluntary licensing agreement to allow generic manufacturers to develop, manufacture and supply cabotegravir long-acting for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. This aims to enable access to the drug in least developed, low-income, lower middle-income and sub-Saharan African countries in the coming years. In the meantime, ViiV is working with stakeholders including global health agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), governments and community partners to plan for and support successful introduction of cabotegravir long-acting for pre-exposure prophylaxis into national programmes with ViiV manufactured product. ViiV Healthcare also has voluntary licensing agreements with 17 generic manufacturers to produce and sell low-cost single or fixed-dose combination products containing our HIV medicine dolutegravir for adults in 95 low- and middle-income countries, with one direct licence and the others via the MPP. There are similar agreements with 14 generic manufacturers for children, covering 123 countries. As a result of these voluntary licence agreements, around 21 million people living with HIV across 122 countries had access to a generic product containing dolutegravir by the end of 2022. This is at least 80% of people living with HIV on antiretrovirals in low- and middle-income countries. In 2022, ViiV Healthcare donated around 7,200 packs of antiretroviral medicines to NGO partners and national HIV and AIDS programmes to support people living with HIV who have been impacted by the conflict in Ukraine. ViiV has also provided over \u00a3800,000 through its Positive Action programme to support 11 community-based organisations with humanitarian response activities, both within Ukraine and in surrounding countries hosting refugees. Positive Action, ViiV Healthcare's community grant-giving programme, celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2022 with a year-long campaign to showcase the people at the heart of the programme, the partners in implementation and the progress made through collaboration. It invested more than \u00a312.6 million in 2022, reaching approximately 392,000 people and providing 137 grants across 33 countries. Malaria Working with our partners, more than 1.2 million children in Africa have now received at least one dose of our malaria vaccine, Mosquirix (RTS,S/AS01 E). Developed over more than 35 years by GSK and our partners, Mosquirix is the first and only vaccine that, in clinical trials, has shown an acceptable safety profile and is feasible to deliver, and substantially reduce, deadly severe malaria in children. In September 2022, the WHO awarded pre- qualification to the vaccine, following a rigorous regulatory process to ensure it meets standards of quality, safety and efficacy, and is suitable for the target population. This is a prerequisite for UN agencies to procure the vaccine, and an important step in rolling it out in countries with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission.

This was complemented by a specific paediatric HIV testing component towards the end of 2021, funded by ViiV Healthcare's Positive Action programme, which worked with healthcare workers and managers to strengthen healthcare systems to improve laboratory testing and diagnostics, surveillance, information systems and supply chains. Through the TB and malaria programme, over 2,500 healthcare workers have been trained across both countries in 2022. In the Kenyan sub-counties supported by the programme, 97% of all healthcare workers are able to effectively diagnose and manage TB and malaria, and there has been an 81% uptake of preventative services in the community. In Ethiopia, integrating TB, malaria and HIV care means that women and children can benefit from screening for all three diseases during a single antenatal care appointment. In 2022, we brought together Amref Health Africa and Cognizant - one of GSK's technology partners - to integrate three digital tools to better plan, identify and respond to healthcare worker training needs at the community level. The platform has been successfully piloted and the hope is it will now reach thousands of healthcare workers across sub-Saharan Africa with quality training and help meet the needs of millions of people.Our partnership with Save the Children aims to cut the number of children dying from preventable and treatable diseases, strengthen healthcare systems, drive R&D to address critical knowledge gaps and create systemic change for children's health at a global level. We support Save the Children's emergency preparedness and response capabilities by investing in data analytics and early action protocols. Since 2013, our partnership has reached 3.5 million children globally across 46 countries, trained 38,740 healthcare workers and supported 21,480 community healthcare workers. In 2022, the GSK-Save the Children partnership began work on two of the UN's Green Climate Fund projects, in Malawi and Senegal, that will support their national governments' objectives of addressing the health impacts of climate change, by contributing to more resilient healthcare systems. Through our collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates CEO Roundtable programme, we're also working with J&J, Novartis, Eli Lilly and Pfizer to train healthcare workers in six African countries. The programme trained around 3,000 healthcare workers in 2022.12 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 20232019 2020 2021 2022 US pricing 1 year change in list and net price1 Change in combined average net price for our pharmaceutical and vaccines portfolio in the US since the previous year-5.0% -0.7% +5.5% +1.4% Change in average list price in the US since the previous year +2.5% +3.2% +3.8% +3.8% 5 year list and net price (compound annual growth rate)1 Change in net price (after discounts, rebates or other allowances) for our products in the US over the past 5 years-4.0% -3.2% -2.0% -1.1% Change in average list price in the US over the past 5 years +6.4% +5.7% +4.6% +3.9% Product reach (doses supplied to lower income countries) Doses of Synflorix vaccines supplied to Gavi (m) 67 56 39 40 PR A Doses of Rotarix vaccines supplied to Gavi (m) 44 53 49 43 PR A Doses of Cervarix vaccines supplied to Gavi (m) 0.1 0.4 0.4 0.2 PR A Doses of OPV vaccines supplied to UNICEF (m) 204 110 80 95 PR A Doses of Mosquirix (RTS,S/AS01 E) vaccines supplied through the MVIP (m) 1 2 1 1 PR A Albendazole tablets donated to help eliminate lymphatic filariasis (m)2698 304 451 440 PR A Albendazole tablets donated to help treat intestinal worms (m)3192 113 75 93 PR A Total doses supplied (m) 1,206 638 695 712 PR A Product reach (people reached in lower income countries) People with access to a generic dolutegravir product through voluntary licensing agreements ('000) 4- - - 20,927 A Estimated children reached with Synflorix through Gavi ('000) 20,700 17,100 12,000 ('000) 25,400 Cervarix through Gavi ('000) 45 180 170 106 A Estimated people reached with OPV through UNICEF ('000) 40,800 21,900 16,010 18,975 A Estimated reached with Mosquirix (RTS,S/AS01 E) through the MVIP ('000) - - 310 A Total people reached ('000) 82,745 64,580 52,030 73,011 A People reached through our healthcare access programmes5 People accessing a healthcare service, worker or educational session through our work with Save the Children ('000)355 400 438 91 6 People accessing a healthcare worker, service or facility as a result of the Bill & Melinda Gates CEO Roundtable programme ('000) 7- - 162 98 People reached through ViiV Healthcare's Positive Action for Children Fund grants ('000)8638 484 188 13 People reached through ViiV Healthcare's Positive Action 2020-2030 Strategy grants ('000)8- - 274 379 People reached through our US Patient Assistance Programs ('000) 123 96 87 79 A PR Metric contributes to our ESG Performance Rating.

We're determined to help change the trajectory of high burden infectious diseases that disproportionately affect underserved people around the world, trapping them in cycles of disease and poverty. To deliver our goals, we have a dedicated Global Health Unit where success is measured by health impact not profit. Including ViiV Healthcare, we're working on more than 30 potential vaccines and medicines targeting 13 high burden infectious diseases - putting our unique R&D and scientific expertise to work to address some of the world's biggest health challenges, including tuberculosis (TB), malaria and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We have two world-leading, dedicated Global Health innovation hubs for vaccines and medicines that are developing products and technologies to prevent and treat priority infectious diseases. In 2022, we progressed 12 Global Health pipeline assets to address priority WHO diseases, exceeding our target of three. As well-functioning healthcare systems are critical to enabling access to the right treatments and vaccines, we work with long-term partners to help strengthen healthcare systems in lower income countries, driven by local needs. Our work to increase underserved people's access to medicines and vaccines is described in Access, on page 9.Global health and health security We use our expertise to address the biggest health challenges for underserved people around the world. Our commitment To develop novel products and technologies to treat and prevent priority diseases, including pandemic threatsHow we assess performance -Progress three Global Health pipeline assets to address priority WHO diseases>30 R&D projects relevant to antimicrobial resistance in our pipeline12 Global Health pipeline assets to address priority WHO diseases progressed in 2022\u00a31bn investment in R&D to help us get ahead of infectious diseases in lower income countries Global health R&D \u00a31 billion to accelerate R&D In June 2022, GSK, including ViiV Healthcare, announced a \u00a31 billion investment in R&D to help us get ahead of infectious diseases in lower income countries. The 10-year investment will support R&D on new medicines and vaccines to prevent and treat TB, malaria, HIV, enteric diseases, and neglected tropical diseases, and to reduce AMR. It will help fund our goal of ending HIV and AIDS by developing and enabling access to innovative treatment and prevention options. By advancing our industry-leading pipeline for vaccines, including first-in-class vaccines against invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis and shigellosis, this R&D investment aims to reduce the threat from AMR. Tackling tuberculosis TB was responsible for 1.6 million deaths in 2021, making it the world's second-leading cause of death by infectious disease, after COVID-19. We want to discover shorter, simpler and safer treatments for TB. In 2022, alongside our partners and through public-private research consortiums, we continued to progress our pipeline of novel TB medicines. In 2022, we announced positive phase IIa study results for GSK3036656, a new first-in-class candidate medicine for patients with TB. Results of the study demonstrated the potential for the candidate to become a component of simpler treatment regimens in the future. In partnership with BioVersys, the University of Lille and the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project, TRIC-TB, we also successfully completed phase I trials of BVL-GSK098, which has the potential to help tackle drug resistance by boosting the activity of an existing antibiotic. GSK is the industry leader in two public-private research consortiums supported by the IMI's AMR Accelerator - ERA4TB and Unite4TB - that are aiming to accelerate R&D of new TB drugs and treatment regimens for drug-resistant and drug-sensitive TB. Our approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix14 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Global health and health security continued Each consortium aims to enable the progression of better-tolerated drug regimens of shorter duration for TB patients worldwide, with the goal of improving their quality of life and life expectancy. These projects bring together expertise from public sector, industry and academic partners to significantly reduce development time for preclinical candidates from pharmaceutical companies. Our TB candidate vaccine (M72/AS01E) has demonstrated the potential to reduce active TB pulmonary disease among adults with latent TB infection in a phase llb trial and has been sub- licensed to the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute to continue its development. This is the first major step in TB prevention in almost 100 years, and the partnership exemplifies GSK's approach to global health R&D. Our unique contribution is our scientific expertise: we focus on research and early development, while partnering with world-leading organisations and funders on late development, manufacturing and access, so our vaccine can reach patients at scale. Protecting children from malaria Malaria is a complex disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. There are five different types of Plasmodium parasites known to infect humans - P. falciparum is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, while P. vivax is most common in South and South-East Asia, and Latin America. We know that no one tool will be enough to get ahead of malaria, particularly due to growing resistance, so we continue to invest in the next generation of transformative tools. With our partners, we've brought two products for the prevention and treatment of malaria to market - the world's first vaccine against malaria (see Access, page 10), and a single-dose, radical cure for P. vivax malaria. In March 2022, the Australian regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, approved the use of single-dose medicine tafenoquine in children aged two and above in combination with chloroquine for the radical cure of P. vivax malaria. The treatment targets the liver stage of the disease to prevent relapse, and is the first single-dose radical cure to be developed. GSK and our partners Medicines for Malaria Venture developed the dispersible tablet formulation to make it easier for children to take. HIV collaboration in action Almost 75% of the 38 million people living with HIV globally live in low- and middle-income countries. By the end of 2022, generic dolutegravir dispersible tablet 10mg formulations, specially developed for children living with HIV, had rolled out in 73 countries - just two years after the first generic formulation received tentative US FDA approval under the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief scheme. This was facilitated by our innovative public-private partnership between ViiV, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Unitaid and two generic manufacturers with sub-licences from the Medicines Patent Pool, providing technology transfer and know-how as well as regulatory planning support. A second public-private partnership is also ongoing to accelerate generic development and introduction of generic dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine dispersible tablet formulations.The FDA has also approved Triumeq PD, the first dispersible single tablet formulation containing dolutegravir for children weighing more than 10kg, which increases the age-appropriate treatment options for children living with HIV. At the end of 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA also issued a positive opinion recommending marketing authorisation for Triumeq PD for children 14kg and above. Addressing enteric diseases and neglected tropical diseases Through our two Global Health R&D centres we are researching potential solutions for enteric diseases and neglected tropical diseases. Our scientists are looking at a range of diseases across invasive non-typhoidal salmonella, typhoid and paratyphoid Invasive non-typhoidal salmonella can be life-threatening for children in Africa and is a key driver of AMR. We're using our innovative vaccine technology in partnership with the University of Oxford and Vacc-iNTS, to develop a potential candidate vaccine using our Generalised Modules for Membrane Antigens technology. This involves manipulating bacteria cells to produce vaccines that can be manufactured at scale and cost-effectively in low-income countries. Supporting scientific research capacity in Africa To help support global R&D, in December 2022, we announced the fourth call for proposals as part of the Africa Open Lab. The call for proposals is aimed at African early-career scientists who are based in sub-Saharan Africa, with a focus on infectious diseases which disproportionately affect sub-Saharan populations, such as malaria, TB and neglected tropical diseases. Our ambition is to support African early-career scientists to accelerate progress in getting ahead of this major global health challenge and help develop the next generation of African scientific leaders. This follows on from the Africa NCD Open Lab, through which we funded 20 research projects focused on non-communicable diseases.Our approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix15 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Global health and health security continued 2019 2020 2021 2022 Global health pipeline assets for priority diseases Number of assets progressed through the Global Health pipeline to address priority WHO diseases 12 10 5 12 PR AOur approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix PR Metric contributes to our ESG Performance Rating. A Metric's 2022 data has been externally assured.Strengthening health security There are many factors that can jeopardise our health security - from new and emerging infectious diseases to the rise of AMR. Climate change and nature loss also pose a significant risk. We are using our scientific know-how and collaborating with others to help the world better prepare for future health challenges. Getting ahead of antimicrobial resistance AMR poses an urgent threat to public health. A study published in the Lancet in 2022, analysing 2019 data from over 200 countries and territories, showed that 1.27 million deaths were directly attributable to bacterial AMR, a greater toll than from both HIV and malaria. Getting ahead of infectious disease and impending threats like AMR will help protect lives, livelihoods and healthcare systems. Through our R&D expertise and partnering with AMR-focused organisations such as CARB-X, we are driving innovation in both prevention and treatment. We have more than 30 R&D projects across medicines and vaccines that are relevant to AMR, ranging from early- to late-stage development. These include gepotidacin, which could be the first novel oral antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in over 20 years; and in 2022, we announced an exclusive licence agreement with Spero Therapeutics for tebipenem HBr, a late-stage antibiotic that may treat complicated urinary tract infections. 13 of these projects target pathogens deemed 'critical' or 'urgent' by the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. See page 16 of our Annual Report for more about our R&D pipeline. Surveillance is central to tackling AMR. In 2022, we shared data from our long-running Survey of Antibiotic Resistance (SOAR) study, which tracks community-acquired respiratory infections, with the new AMR Register, developed by Vivli. We will continue to share new data as it is available. This initiative will help build our collective understanding of how pathogens are evolving and what is needed to protect against them. We also promote effective stewardship of antibiotics and enable access to them. We continue to train healthcare professionals around the world on using and prescribing antibiotics appropriately, and the importance of surveillance studies. To support the responsible manufacturing of antibiotics, we work with the AMR Industry Alliance to set global limits for wastewater antibiotic discharges from factories (see Environment, page 18). In 2022, we also worked with the Alliance to publish a new Antibiotic Manufacturing Standard. This provides clear guidance to manufacturers in the global antibiotic supply chain to help ensure that their antibiotics are made responsibly and in compliance with scientifically robust discharge limits. gsk.com: Position on antimicrobial resistance Future pandemic preparedness To help pre-empt and respond to the next pandemic, we are working with governments and other stakeholders to strengthen global preparedness. This means drawing on what we have learned from COVID-19 and previous outbreaks, championing innovation and promoting sustainable approaches for the biopharmaceutical sector and public health. In July 2022, GSK, along with other major biopharmaceutical companies, signed up to the Berlin Declaration. This sets out the industry's vision for equitable access during future pandemics. The declaration stated the sector's willingness to reserve an allocation of real-time production of medicines and vaccines for distribution to priority populations, as determined by health authorities, during future pandemics. This is dependent on factors such as strong healthcare systems in recipient countries. We are committed to using our world-class global vaccine manufacturing network to support pandemic preparedness and response. In 2022, GSK concluded a series of contracts under which we would provide at least 200 million doses of pandemic influenza vaccine to governments around the world. In February 2022, we extended our pandemic influenza vaccine stockpile contract with the United States government. This was followed by a renewed agreement, in June 2022, for supply of pandemic influenza vaccines to the WHO, and in July 2022, a contract with the government of Canada for both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. We signed an agreement with Europe for the reservation and future production and supply of pandemic influenza vaccines. We are also continuing to partner with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to manufacture and assess the safety and immunogenicity of pandemic influenza vaccine candidates. gsk.com: Position on pandemic preparedness16 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Environment We continue to work hard to do more to protect the environment, often in partnership with others.

We're committed to work towards a net zero, nature positive, healthier planet, with ambitious goals set for 2030 and 2045. These goals cover our entire value chain, from drug discovery to disposal of our products, as well as investing in protecting and restoring nature. At the same time, we are investing to get ahead of the health impacts of climate change by developing and manufacturing new medicines and vaccines for the diseases most affected by climate change, as well as working with partners to improve healthcare system resilience to climate change. Achieving our goals will support long-term value creation, build trust with our stakeholders and reduce risk to our operations. This will require us to collaborate with our patients, suppliers, regulators and peers - and we are integrating sustainability into our operations to ensure delivery. gsk.com: Position on environmental sustainability 2022 environmental action report Climate We have set a clear pathway to a net zero impact on climate with ambitious goals for 2030 and 2045. In 2020, GSK set out a carbon ambition to have a net zero impact on climate by 2030. Our plan to meet this goal aims for 80% carbon reductions across all scopes, against a 2020 baseline, with the remaining 20% offset through investment in high-quality nature-based solutions. In 2021, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) published a new carbon Net-Zero Standard, with the aim of addressing stakeholder concerns around inconsistent methodology and definitions of net zero. To comply with this standard, no change is required to our planned carbon reduction pathway of 80% reductions and 20% offsets by 2030, but in addition we have set a longer-term target that by 2045 we will reduce carbon emissions by at least 90%, with the remainder tackled through high-quality offsets. SBTi has accredited our 2030 carbon target, set prior to our de-merger, as aligned with a 1.5 oC pathway and our reduction pathway to 2030 is significantly more ambitious than the SBTi Net-Zero Standard minimum requirement to halve emissions by 2030. We are currently seeking re-accreditation from the SBTi for our targets as a fully-focused biopharma company. We have also submitted our 2045 target for verification by SBTi against its Net-Zero Standard.17 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Our approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix 1 T argets are measured against a 2020 baseline. 2 P reviously stated as net zero by 2030. 3 T his is a new longer-term target, aligned to the SBTi Net-Zero Standard definition of net zero.Environment continued Our value chain carbon footprint is made up of: -Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our own operations (8%) -Scope 3 emissions from our suppliers (29%) -Scope 3 emissions from people using our products (54%), metered-dose inhalers -Other scope 3 emissions (9%) Targets1: -80% reduction in carbon emissions and investment in nature-based solutions for the remaining 20% of our footprint by 2030 (all scopes) 2 -100% renewable electricity by 2025 (scope 2) -Net zero emissions across our full value chain by 2045 (all scopes) 3 gsk.com: Net zero pathway Managing our operational footprint In 2022, we reduced our scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 6% compared with 2021. This was primarily through increasing our use of renewable electricity and continued delivery of energy efficiency across our sites, such as the installation of new solar panels, upgraded lighting and replacing chillers to reduce the use of ozone-depleting refrigerant. For example, at our site in Irvine, Scotland, a closed-loop heating system has helped to drive reductions in operating costs, and on-site renewables and biogas will provide 55% of its energy by the end of 2023. As a member of RE100, we have committed to source 100% renewable electricity by 2025. In 2022, we reached 73%, an increase of 6% since 2021 and 28% since 2020. We are also a member of EV100 and have committed to install charging infrastructure at 100 sites and transition our sales fleet to low-carbon vehicles by 2030. As of October 2022, hybrid or fully electric vehicles made up 4% of our fleet, and we have chargers installed at 30 sites, with the number of chargers increasing from 309 in 2021 to 435 in 2022 at these locations. Reducing our value chain emissions Following the demerger of our Consumer Healthcare business, we are restating our value chain carbon footprint for our baseline year 2020. In 2021 (our latest available data), our scope 3 emissions reduced by 13% compared with 2020. These reductions reflect the evolution of our product portfolio.Supply chain emissions Approximately 29% of our total emissions footprint comes from the goods and services that we buy. In September 2022, we launched a Sustainable Procurement Programme, which requires our suppliers to take action on carbon, power, heat, transport, water, waste and the sustainable, deforestation-free sourcing of materials. From 2023, among other things, they will be required to disclose emissions, set carbon reduction targets aligned with 1.5 oC, and switch to renewable power and heat. As part of this new programme, we will actively support our suppliers with education and the adoption of new environmental sustainability measures. In October 2022, at the GSK Supplier Forum attended by 120 of our top suppliers, we presented our sustainability plans along with clear expectations and available support for suppliers. We continued to build capability across our procurement function to integrate sustainability, including through tender questions, contractual provisions and performance metrics. Supply chain emissions are a shared challenge across our industry sector and we are collaborating to find shared solutions. For example, we participate in the Manufacture 2030 initiative with our industry peers, which encourages our suppliers to measure, manage and reduce their emissions. Suppliers registered on this platform account for almost three-quarters of our emissions from purchased goods. With Manufacture 2030, we co-developed the Activate programme, along with four other founding companies, to help active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) suppliers gain access to green funding and practical support to accelerate decarbonisation initiatives. We are also working with our peers through the Energize programme to encourage the use of renewable energy throughout the pharmaceutical sector's supply chain. In 2022, nine suppliers formed the first Energize buyer's cohort, who together will purchase two terawatt-hours of renewable electricity. We are part of the Sustainable Markets Initiative Health Systems Task Force, made of up CEOs from seven global healthcare companies. In 2022, the task force announced joint action on near-term emissions reduction targets and accelerating the delivery of net zero healthcare systems by addressing emissions across supply chains, patient care pathways and clinical trials. Emissions from the use of our products The use of our medicines and vaccines by patients makes up more than 50% of our total climate impact. This is predominantly from the propellant used in metered dose inhalers for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We are investing in an R&D programme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from this vital medicine, and have made good progress towards a reformulation of Ventolin , which could reduce the climate impact by up to 90%, if the clinical trials are successful. Climate-related financial disclosures See pages 55 to 62 in our Annual Report for our disclosure on climate risk and resilience in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.18 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Environment continued Nature We are committed to working towards our goal of having a net positive impact on nature by 2030, by reducing our environmental impacts across water, waste and materials, and biodiversity and by investing in protecting and restoring nature. Protecting nature plays a vital role in protecting human health. Habitat degradation increases the risk of new human pathogens and pandemics emerging. The natural world also provides ingredients for existing medicines and inspiration for new ones. We are making good progress on meeting our water, waste and materials, and biodiversity targets. We are one of the first companies to trial the Science Based Targets Network for Nature (SBTN) methodology, to better understand our impacts and dependencies on nature. We are also a member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), which is developing a risk management and financial disclosure framework similar to that of the TCFD. Water Targets1: -Achieve good water stewardship at 100% of our sites by 20252 -Reduce overall water use in our operations by 20% by 2030 -Be water neutral in our own operations and at key suppliers in water-stressed regions by 2030 2 -Zero impact API levels for all sites and key suppliers by 20303 In 2022, we reduced overall water use in our operations by 5% since 2021 and by 1% in sites in high water stress regions. This is a decrease of 23% for overall water use and 6% for sites in high water stress regions against our 2020 baseline. This achieved our 2030 overall water use reduction target, which we will now review. 100% of our sites are now good water stewards, in line with the Alliance for Water Stewardship's definition. We have initially identified three water basins in water-stressed areas in Algeria, India and Pakistan where we have manufacturing sites, and where we aim to be water neutral. At our manufacturing facility in Nashik, India, we have built plants for rainwater harvesting. We are committed to keeping any API emissions from manufacturing, including those that might contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), below levels that might have a negative impact on human health or the environment. This applies to our own sites and those of our key suppliers. In 2022, 100% of our sites and 98% of our suppliers that manufacture antibiotics complied with AMR Alliance industry standards on safe discharges. We are a partner in the Prioritisation and Risk Evaluation of Medicines in the Environment (PREMIER) project with the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a collaboration across industry, academia and regulators. It involves working with stakeholders to develop tools, models and data to characterise environmental risk for APIs, making environmental data on APIs more accessible and exploring the feasibility of greener drug design. gsk.com: Water Value chain water footprint Position on pharmaceuticals in the environmentMaterials and the circular economy Targets1: -Zero operational waste, including eliminating single-use plastics, by 2030 2 -25% environmental impact reduction for our products and packaging by 2030 -10% waste reduction from our supply chain by 2030 In 2022, we continued to reduce the waste from our sites and increase the amount of materials recovered through circular routes like reuse or recycling. For example, at some of our sites we have introduced recycling for our chemical containers, new solvent recovery processes and eliminated the use of disposable gowns. We are also targeting materials across our existing product portfolio. This includes removing paper leaflets and moving to e-leaflets where regulation permits. Our vaccines business has also stopped using PVC blisters when packing pre-filled syringes and is removing the plastic film wrapping used on pallets. We have built the capability to perform eco-design analyses and have completed a detailed analysis of an antibiotic product which has identified a number of projects to reduce its environmental impact. Our R&D laboratories in Upper Providence have been certified by My Green Labs, which is considered to be the gold standard for laboratory sustainability best practice around the world. gsk.com: Materials and waste Biodiversity Targets: -Positive impact on biodiversity at all sites by 2030 -100% agricultural, forestry and marine-derived materials sustainably sourced and deforestation free by 2030 We are progressing our plans for net positive biodiversity at our own sites by investing in individual site action plans that improve habitats, protect species and improve soil and water quality. In 2022, we completed baseline biodiversity assessments for 80% of our sites. We have commenced biodiversity uplift projects at our three largest R&D facilities. We have also completed a full assessment of our biodiversity impact (across the entire value chain), in line with the latest SBTN guidance, and will be taking targeted actions to address the highly-stressed areas. Our new Sustainable Sourcing Standard outlines the environmental, social and ethical requirements which must be met by 2030 for each supply chain to be considered sustainably sourced. As a first stage, we are addressing the 12 most critical agricultural, forestry and marine-derived materials. We reached our 2022 target of 90% of sustainably sourced paper and palm oil, and now have roadmaps in place to achieve 100% by 2025. We have engaged with associated suppliers to map the full supply chains involved, understand existing sustainability standards, identify gaps and establish remediation plans.

In the lead-up to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the critical COP15 conference in Canada at the end of 2022, we worked with partners to call for mandatory disclosure by businesses and financial institutions of their impacts and dependencies on nature. We also worked with our partners to help raise business ambition on nature and to ensure that health and the healthcare sector is part of the dialogue. gsk.com: Biodiversity Protecting and restoring nature Investing in nature protection and restoration is fundamental to achieving our climate and nature goals as well as positive impacts on human health. We aim to maximise the reductions we can make to our environmental impacts and only offset those emissions that cannot be abated. Our robust criteria for carbon offsetting prioritise credits from high-quality, technically robust, accredited projects that contribute to land protection and restoration, and have the potential to deliver nature, social and health co-benefits to local communities. We have invested in a community reforestation project in Ghana, which creates jobs, promotes gender equality and supports the provision of clean water and sanitation. The project, which follows Forestry Stewardship Council principles, has generated carbon credits in line with the Verified Carbon Standard's criteria for environmental integrity, which we have retired in 2022 to support a carbon neutrality claim for an inhaler product in the UK. We have also invested in a project in Indonesia that aims to restore 2,500 hectares of mangroves through community-led projects. This project aims to deliver between 120,000 and 240,000 tonnes of removal credits annually from 2028 to 2035, covering approximately 8% of our forecasted 2030 residual emissions based on our current carbon reduction glidepaths. Collaboration is key to ensuring adequate supply of high-quality projects that meet rigorous standards. We are part of the LEAF Coalition (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance), a private-public effort to protect tropical forests. We are also testing guidance from the Voluntary Carbon Market Integrity Initiative, which is working to establish a globally-standardised benchmark to guide the use of carbon credits by companies. Nature-related financial disclosures See pages 62 to 63 in our Annual Report for how we plan to disclose on our impacts and dependencies on nature in line with the emerging TNFD framework. Adaptation and resilience Climate change and nature loss are altering the burden and spread of disease globally, exacerbating existing health threats, creating new ones, putting healthcare systems under pressure and increasing health inequalities. This means that health, particularly within vulnerable communities, must be a key part of adaptation and resilience discussions. In 2022, we joined the Race to Resilience campaign, with a pledge to help 15 million people become more resilient to the health impacts of climate change by 2030. GSK is the first biopharma company to join this campaign. We will support it through investment and partnerships with organisations such as Save the Children and Microsoft, who GSK is working with to support local health interventions with disease surveillance. As part of this commitment, GSK will also focus on nature resilience through nature-based action, such as supporting people with water stress as part of the Water Resilience Coalition and reducing air pollution via the Alliance for Clean Air. We are also working to research and develop new medicines and vaccines for climate-aggravated diseases. More than 50% of the funding allocated to date from our 10-year, \u00a31 billion R&D investment for infectious diseases which disproportionately impact lower income countries is focused on climate-aggravated diseases, see Global Health page 13. 20 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Environment continuedOur approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix 2019 2020 2021 Natural electricity (GWh) 631 697 A Purchased non-renewable electricity (GWh) 1,223 605 372 263 On-site renewably generated electricity (GWh) 22 19 13 18 A Exported electricity (GWh) 4 9 8 8 Coal (GWh) 0 0 0 0 Other fossil fuels (GWh) 62 49 58 81 Renewable heat (GWh) 7 9 8 13 Purchased heating and cooling (GWh) 57 52 52 41 Total energy for operations (GWh) 3,240 3,085 Scope 1 and 2 emissions1 On-site fuel use (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) 355 355 333 320 Sales force vehicles (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) 111 60 52 51 Propellant emissions during manufacture of inhalers (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) 220 275 237 243 On-site waste or wastewater treatment (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) 0 0 0 0 Refrigerant gas losses (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) 27 20 11 13 Total scope 1 emissions (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) 712 711 633 626 A Electricity (market-based emissions) (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) 342 163 125 84 Purchased heating and cooling (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) 6 6 6 4 Total scope 2 market-based emissions (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) 348 169 131 88 A Total scope 2 location-based emissions (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) 357 309 285 265 A Total scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) 1,060 879 764 715 PR A Fermentation/biogenic releases (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) 32 27 10 12 Carbon: Scope 3 emissions2 Purchased goods and services (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) - 3,267 2,725 - Capital goods (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) - 162 154 - Fuel and energy-related activities (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) - 89 84 - Transportation and distribution (upstream) (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) - 267 189 - Waste generated in operations (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) - 20 64 - Business travel (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) - 42 50 - Employee commuting (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) - 37 48 - Leased assets (upstream) (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) - 0 0 - Transportation and distribution (downstream) (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) - 135 99 - Processing of sold products (thousands of tonnes CO 2e) - 0 0 - PR Metric contributes to our ESG Performance Rating.

As reported by Deloitte in the 'Other Matters' section of their independent assurance report on pages 52 to 55, during the course of the assurance engagement Deloitte were unable to obtain the evidence needed to support a conclusion. Due to the complexity of the waste data, significant remediation was required for measurement and reporting of waste metrics. GSK took on additional support through a third party to complete the remediation in addition to requesting Deloitte to remove waste metrics from the scope of the assurance engagement. 3 2019-21 data includes our previous Consumer Healthcare business.23 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are central to our purpose of getting ahead of disease together. Being an inclusive and diverse business - and doing business inclusively - makes us more successful, making the most of our people's potential and increasing our positive impact. We want better health outcomes for all, which is why we make sure our clinical trials reflect the population affected by the disease. We want an inclusive workplace, where GSK people reflect the communities where we operate and where our leadership reflects our GSK people. This helps our company to perform better as it brings better insights, better quality decision making and, crucially, helps us understand our diverse patients. We are working to make STEM education more equitable and increasing the number of under-represented people in STEM careers, with a focus on the US, and plans to increase our focus in the UK in 2023. This will help to ensure that the health innovators of the future are more diverse. Diversity, equity and inclusion We want to ensure our people can thrive, foster diversity in our clinical trials and support diverse communities, as becoming a more inclusive business is central to our purpose. Our commitment Create a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace; enhance recruitment of diverse patient populations in our clinical trials; and support diverse communities How we assess performance -75% of phase III trials initiated in 2022 will have proactive plans in place designed to enrol appropriately diverse trial participants, consistent with disease epidemiology -Performance towards 2025 aspirations through fair and equitable opportunities: -have women hold at least 45% of VP-and-above roles globally by the end of 2025 -have at least 30% ethnically diverse leaders in our roles at VP and above in the US, and increase the percentage of Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latinx VP-and- above leaders year on year -have at least 18% ethnically diverse leaders in our roles at VP and above in the UK, and increase the percentage of Black VP-and-above leaders year on year -Improve year-on-year spend with certified US-based diverse-owned suppliers100% 2022 phase III trials include a demographic plan31.3% ethnically diverse leaders at VP level and above in the US42% VP-and-above roles held by women globally Building an inclusive business Some diseases disproportionately impact specific patient groups, and the safety and efficacy of medicines and vaccines can differ based on genetic or environmental factors. Therefore, having the appropriate representation in clinical research is critical for advancing our understanding of new medicines and vaccines to ensure they have the biggest impact on patients. We are committed to improving diversity in clinical trial enrolment and are already using our disease insights to set diversity enrolment goals. We know some barriers negatively impact the clinical trial turnout of certain patient populations, such as access to transportation, language differences, and lack of trust and awareness. We are working with patient advocacy groups and academic organisations to tackle them. We are also collaborating with regulators, patients, other biopharma companies and the wider healthcare ecosystem so that together we can make meaningful progress on diverse participation in clinical trials and achieve a shared goal of better health outcomes for all.At the end of 2022, 100% of GSK's phase III trials had a diversity plan in place to enrol the groups most affected by the disease being studied, based on epidemiology data. For example, in our hepatitis B trials, a disease that disproportionately affects people of African and Asian descent, 52% of participants are of Asian origin, and we are actively working to improve the representation of participants of African descent. gsk.com: Approach to clinical trials Strengthening our supply chain by supporting diverse-owned suppliers Our supplier diversity programme is well established in the US, and an expansion plan is being developed for the UK. Through our programme, we seek to provide opportunities to under- represented groups, including women, ethnic minorities, members of the LGBT+ community, people with disabilities and military veterans, as well as small businesses in high-unemployment, low-income communities. Our approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix24 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023We engage with and mentor small and diverse-owned businesses in our supply chain and help them identify potential areas for growth. We have a target to increase spend annually with certified US-based diverse-owned suppliers. This was significantly exceeded in 2022 through a combination of spend increases with selected suppliers in marketing, sales and technology, as well as identification of new global diverse suppliers and a strong multi-year strategy of engagement with key advocacy groups.Diversity, equity and inclusion continued Nurturing all of our people Our Code requires all our people to commit to being inclusive and aware of their impact on others and annual mandatory training on Creating an Inclusive Workplace sets out the standards we expect. gsk.com: The Code Building diverse teams through fair and equitable opportunities We are committed to equality of representation so that our workforce reflects the communities we work and hire in, and that our GSK leadership reflects our workforce. We are committed to increasing the representation of women and ethnically diverse people in senior roles, and we ensure that our recruitment and selection processes are fair and equitable, and that our managers are committed to building diverse and inclusive teams. We expect diverse shortlists (gender and ethnicity) for vacancies in our senior grades, and we have worked with recruitment agencies, our internal Employee Representation Groups (ERGs) and specialist organisations, to continue to gain insight and support, to drive our progress. All hiring managers are required to complete inclusive interview training before they start their selection process. As part of work building our future pipeline, our Accelerating Difference programme supports the development of women and ethnically diverse leaders through individual and group coaching, accelerating their readiness for future roles. In 2022, women held 42% of VP-and-above roles globally, compared with 40% in 2021, bringing us closer to our 2025 aspirational target. Women made up 47% of all employees in 2022, and 50% of all management roles. We remain committed to improving the application of fair and equitable pay practices to ensure equal opportunities and equal pay for equal work. We conduct country-based reviews and ensure all markets have clear guidance, tools and support to ensure pay equity. If unexplainable differences are detected, we address them through our compensation processes. We published our sixth UK gender pay gap report in 2022. Our gender pay gap for all permanent UK-based GSK employees is -1.36% (mean), compared to the national average of 13.9%. We published our first UK ethnicity pay gap report for 2022 using the same approach as our gender pay gap. Our ethnicity pay gap for all permanent UK-based GSK employees is 0.06% (mean), at this time there is no national average comparator. Given our commitment to diversity we're sharing our UK ethnicity pay gap data based on the approach for gender pay gap, recognising that adjustments to the calculation methodology may be required in future. In those countries that meet our criteria for data confidentiality and anonymity, we disclose the race and ethnicity of our people at each level and set aspirational targets. Currently, the US and the UK meet those criteria. In the US in 2022, we have 31.3% of ethnically diverse leaders at VP level and above, reaching our 2025 aspirational target of at least 30%, and increasing the percentage of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latinx people in those roles year on year. In the UK in 2022, we have 14.3% of ethnically diverse leaders at VP and above, continuing to make progress towards our 2025 aspirational target of reaching at least 18%. Black representation at VP and above remains flat and we will be focused in our efforts to achieve our aspiration for year-on-year growth. We cannot build a representative workforce without a representative pool of job applicants. In the US, we engage with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic Serving Institutions, to encourage applications for our graduate positions and target recruitment campaigns to reach under- represented groups. gsk.com: Gender pay gap report Fostering inclusion in our workplaces We are working to create an inclusive workplace that is accessible to all, and a culture of empathy and acceptance where we embrace each other's differences and identities. We are members of the UK government's Disability Confident scheme, and we launched a three-year plan in 2020 to increase our disability confidence. Since 2020, GSK has been an active member of the Valuable 500 pledge, a grouping of 500 global companies committed to placing disability inclusion on the leadership agenda. We are delivering on the scheme's objectives through our long-term, measurable, disability confidence plan, which includes educating our people on the issue. We are always looking at how we can better support people through different life stages and making sure our offerings are fair and inclusive. In 2022, we introduced a new global minimum standard of 18 weeks' parental leave for primary and secondary carers for all forms of family, a new global minimum standard for care of a family member for end of life or serious health emergencies, insured benefits to include same sex partners wherever possible, a new financial wellbeing service and mental health training - available to everyone. This year, we were recognised as a Gold employer within Stonewall's Top Global Employers Index. Our Allyship programme received an award recognising the tangible impact the campaign has had on the lives of LGBT+ employees. The programme, launched at the end of 2021, helps our people become more effective allies, supporting colleagues to feel welcome, valued and included. We also achieved the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Best Places to Work for LGBT+ Equality standard in 2022.

This builds trust in what we do, protects our business and helps create a workplace where we all thrive. How we do things is as important as what we do. In 2022, we launched our new Code of Conduct which reflects our purpose to unite science, technology and talent to get ahead of disease together. Our new Code sets out the commitments we make as a company and to each other to deliver on our purpose and ambitions. The Code is supported by additional global policies and standards, which are located in our new Code Hub. Additionally, our people are required to complete our accompanying global mandatory learning curriculum, Living our Code, comprised of three modules: The Code, Creating an Inclusive Workplace and Protecting GSK. Protecting GSK focuses on key risk areas such as anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC), cyber security, and privacy around reporting human safety information related to our products, as well as Speak Up. In 2022, 100% of employees and 98% of complementary workers completed this training where due by year end. Those in certain high-risk roles or geographic regions also complete additional ABAC training. This helps them identify and mitigate any potential ABAC risk - especially in third-party relationships - and to recognise, report and manage conflicts of interest. In 2022, 100% of employees and 96% of complementary workers completed this training where due by year end. Our approach to managing ABAC risk, and other risks relating to ethical standards, forms part of our well embedded risk management framework, which is described in detail in our Annual Report, on pages 51 to 52. gsk.com: Anti-bribery and corruption policy The Code Reporting and investigating concerns Anyone inside or outside GSK can raise concerns or speak to our integrity lines, confidentially and anonymously, without fear of retaliation. We take every concern seriously and review every report to see whether we need to investigate formally. If our investigations show an employee has breached our policies, we take action. This year, we have updated how we report the breakdown of types of policy violations to provide more granularity by case class as there was a broader distribution from the top five policy area categories historically reported. In 2022, we saw an overall decrease in disciplinary cases, attributed to, in part, a revision to our procedures for discipline regarding late completion of mandatory training, now reported under the employee conduct category. The majority of environment, health and safety (EHS) and sustainability category increases in 2022 were written warnings related to compliance with the company's COVID-19 vaccination mandate, safety or testing requirements, to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of our workforce. In 2022, we continued to embed greater focus on the use of risk analytics and monitoring aligned to increasing levels of business activities, enhancing risk identification and targeted interventions. Additionally, we focused on closure of cases, resulting in a decrease in open cases at year end from prior years with correlation in rising numbers of employees who were dismissed or agreed to leave the company voluntarily as a result of misconduct.Ethical standards Our culture guides our people to do the right thing and Speak Up about any concerns they have. It is important that all our people live up to this, and we expect the same of our suppliers.

We continue to make progress in integrating our salient human rights (access to healthcare, research practices, patient safety, EHS, and privacy) within our operations and how we conduct our business. We are signatories to the UN Global Compact and our Human Rights Position statement lays out our commitment to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. During the year, we established a Human Rights Steering Group, which has a formal reporting mechanism to the Board's Corporate Responsibility Committee. The Steering Group comprises senior representatives from the key business functions who are accountable for ensuring respect for human rights within their business area. The Steering Group is facilitated and attended by external human rights experts. In 2022, we developed guidance to enhance supplier visits to help employees better understand labour and human rights non-compliances. To support this guidance, we also developed and delivered labour rights training to EHS and procurement employees to better equip them to spot human rights issues when visiting suppliers. We are committed to the application of fair and equitable pay practices, which includes ensuring that all employees globally receive pay that is competitive in their local markets and sufficient to support a sustainable standard of living. In 2022, we completed the first global living wage review in partnership with the Fair Wage Foundation. We assessed the pay of all our employees (over 75,000 people in 87 countries) and differences were detected in fewer than 200 cases, in 11 countries. All necessary adjustments will be made by the end of the first quarter of 2023. We will be factoring the living wage data into our standard compensation processes to ensure that we continue to offer a fair wage, and have built an annual living wage review into our standard cycle. For more information on how we uphold our commitments to human rights, please refer to our Modern Slavery Act statement. gsk.com: Position on human rights Modern Slavery Act statementEthical standards continued 1 G SK maintains a list of globally medically critical products. These are drug products approved to treat a life-threatening disease or medical condition for which there is no other adequately available alternative and of which GSK is the only provider. 2 O ur EHS priority suppliers are API suppliers who are, or will be, medically-, R&D-, or revenue-critical to GSK, or are high spend suppliers. 3 T he 600 supplier employees trained includes data from our previous Consumer Healthcare business.Working with third parties Our suppliers and other third parties - including agents, distributors, affiliate companies (where we have an equity stake) - help us research, develop, manufacture and distribute the medicines, vaccines and other products that patients need. How these third parties act can have a direct impact on us. It is important to manage our relationships with them well, including the way we choose, contract and monitor them. We expect our third parties to meet our ABAC and labour rights standards, where relevant, and to comply with our standards on quality, health and safety, and the environment. See Annual Report, pages 285 to 295. We updated our Third-Party Risk Management programme, which evaluates and mitigates risks introduced by third parties engaged by GSK to provide goods or services. In 2022, for our high-risk third parties - determined by location in high-risk markets and size of spend - we performed 7,168 assessments across 20 risk areas. Over 62% of these assessments presented risks in one or more areas. Most of these third parties are goods and services providers (77%), distributors and wholesalers (5%), contract manufacturers and suppliers (1%) and direct material suppliers (1%). We also use tools to assess how suppliers manage risks, including EcoVadis desktop assessments. We give additional support on EHS risks to our largest suppliers, including those who supply globally medically critical products, are critical to our R&D, and those largest by spend 1. We help suppliers improve safety management systems and build overall EHS capability, focusing on active pharmaceutical ingredients manufacturers and contract manufacturing suppliers. We set EHS requirements and review performance as part of our internal EHS governance and oversight. We visit sites, in person or virtually, to help suppliers better understand and control their risks. The relaxation of travel restrictions has allowed us to increase in-person visits to identify and reduce risk, enabling us to conduct 50 physical visits across 63 priority suppliers this year 2. We completed warehouse safety surveys for 54 priority suppliers, 38 contract manufacturing suppliers and 15 large warehouses that hold stock this year. These surveys have generated corrective and preventative action plans, all of which we expect to complete in 2023. In 2022, we conducted 47 supplier audits, compared with 49 in 2021, following industry standard Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative guidelines, with any corrective and preventative actions tracked to completion. We have also trained more than 600 supplier employees on EHS and ESG fundamentals in 2022, revised EHS contractual obligations, tracked management actions to completion, and have helped suppliers improve their EcoVadis scores 3.

The data security and privacy landscape is rapidly changing. Threats to cyber security are constantly proliferating, while the introduction of privacy regulations by national and state-level authorities requires continual assessment and review of our privacy framework and controls. In response, we have created a new digital, privacy and information security team within Legal and Compliance, to streamline support and provide expertise around GSK's digital and data strategy. This global team will partner with our businesses to assess the impact of changing global and local privacy regulations, and to mitigate related risks. See Annual Report, pages 291 to 292. Using data responsibly Privacy and the ethical use of data are part of the global mandatory learning curriculum Living our Code that all our people have to complete. It means they understand that everyone at GSK is responsible for handling personal information in the right way. We ensure that key privacy personnel have certifications and sufficient training and experience to carry out their roles effectively. We are investing in our artificial intelligence and machine learning capability to, for example, help analyse patients' genetic data. We are mindful that artificial intelligence and machine learning can raise ethical issues and are subject to evolving decisions from policymakers on how best to promote trust in these systems and avoid unintended outcomes or harmful impacts. In R&D, we have oversight boards and a new advisory panel that oversees controls to manage how we use or re-use data and respond to bioethical questions in our research activities. This makes sure we follow regulations and meet our ethical obligations. Ethical standards continued Political engagement As part of a heavily regulated industry, our business model and market can be influenced by legislation and regulation. As a major multinational company, we seek to contribute to public policy debate, especially in relation to life sciences and healthcare. We, along with other stakeholders such as non-governmental organisations, scientists, healthcare professionals, patients and industry groups, are frequently invited by governments to give our views on development of new policies. In all of our political engagements, we are committed to ensuring that we adhere to the highest ethical standards and legislative requirements.

We have systems in place across GSK to ensure we meet the high standards we set ourselves as a company, and those that are expected of us externally. They help us deliver a reliable supply of high-quality products and support a values-driven culture where issues are responded to swiftly and transparently. Product governance Ensuring the quality, safety and reliable supply of our products is critical to protecting patients and delivering health impact. 1 We consider any observations from the US FDA as major. 2 C ritical finding from one inspection by the Chinese regulator of a third-party manufacturing facility used by GSK. 3 C lass I recalls are triggered by a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. Class II recalls address the use of or exposure to a violative product which may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences, or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. Class III recalls relate to the use of or exposure to a violative product which is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.Our commitment We commit to maintaining robust quality and safety processes, and using data and new technologies responsibly How we assess performance -Average number of critical and major findings by FDA/MHRA/EMA regulators1 -Percentage of inspections from all regulators with no critical findings or official action indicated -Number of FDA warning letters -Total number of Class I/II external product recalls across all markets -Register and disclose all human subject research of GSK products. Specifically, register protocol summaries for studies initiated in 2022; and disclose results summaries for studies with results due in 2022 A focus on quality management Our GSK Quality Management System is a detailed and specific framework which describes how we comply with regulatory requirements and other standards across our markets. It addresses global and local regulations across manufacturing and distribution processes, and is based on principles defined by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. Responsibility for quality assurance is managed by GSK quality organisations, an extensive global network of quality and compliance professionals within each of our business units, from site-level to senior management. The Quality Management System also details the patient safety and quality process training required by GSK people. This includes induction, hygiene, safety and technical skills training, as well as good distribution and manufacturing practice training. Employees who carry out specific, quality-critical or sensitive activities are subject to additional checks as necessary. Inspections, recalls and audit We are subject to regulatory inspections in the markets we supply our products to. These provide independent assurance that high standards of quality are in place across development, manufacturing and distribution, and are required to maintain our licence to operate.In 2022, we had 122 regulatory inspections at our manufacturing sites and local operating companies, compared with 111 in 2021. We remain prepared for inspections from regulators and received no warning letters from the United States Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) or critical findings from the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulators in 2022; however we received one critical finding from the Chinese regulator 2. We continue to learn from and respond to all inspection findings, taking the necessary action to address them. Throughout 2022, we had no Class I product recalls and there were fewer Class II and III recalls compared with 2021 3. We will not hesitate to voluntarily recall products to protect patients. Working with our suppliers on quality We expect all our contract manufacturers and suppliers to comply with GSK standards, and regularly conduct audits to verify that they do. In 2022, we conducted 1,060 quality audits of suppliers, with an increased focus on active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers. We have a comprehensive quality oversight model that is aligned to our Quality Management System and uses a risk-based approach to assess, qualify, manage and monitor our third-party suppliers on an ongoing basis, driving continuous performance. 7,377 clinical trial protocol summaries registered and 6,295 summaries of results 1,060 quality audits of our suppliers122 regulatory inspections at our manufacturing sites and local operating companiesOur approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix31 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Product governance continued 2019 2020 2021 2022 Regulatory inspections and audits Audits of our third parties' quality processes 1,5631 1,4511 1,044 1,060 Total regulatory inspections from all health authorities 131 86 1112122 PR A % of inspections from all regulators with no critical findings or official action indicated 100% 100% 100% 99% PR A Total regulatory inspections from FDA/MHRA/EMA regulators 39 27 35 36 PR A Number of critical/major findings by FDA/MHRA/EMA regulators 53 11 4 26 PR A Total FDA regulatory inspections 11 7 2 8 PR A Number of FDA observations 39 3 1 16 PR A Number of FDA warning letters 0 0 0 0 PR A Product recalls Total number of Class I external product recalls 1 0 0 0 PR A Total number of Class II external product recalls 6 4 6 5 PR A Total number of Class III external product recalls 19 16 12 7 PR A Total product recalls 26 20 18 12 AMaintaining pharmacovigilance Pharmacovigilance aims to protect those who use medicines and vaccines and support public health programmes with reliable, comprehensive information on the overall benefit-risk balance of our products.

The materiality assessment is used to inform strategic decision-making and helps us to prioritise issues covered in public reporting. This year we used Datamaran's data analytics platform to conduct the assessment. The software monitors external ESG risks by assessing the coverage of issues within peer annual and sustainability reports, regulatory and legislative documents, media and social media. We also conducted stakeholder engagement, through internal and external interviews and analysis of investor ratings, rankings and reports.Through this process, 16 issues were identified as most material to our business and our external stakeholders, illustrated in the matrix below. The issues identified through this process helped confirm our six ESG focus areas: Access, Global health and health security, Environment, Diversity, equity and inclusion, Ethical standards and Product governance.

KPI Definition Method Access Total community investment (\u00a3m) All donations made by GSK globally for charitable purposes including cash, product, in-kind donations, the value of time donated via the Philadelphia STEM Equity Collective and the management costs associated with charitable programmes. Donations are only included if they are voluntary and charitable in purpose. Donations are valued in GBP at year-end exchange rates. Product donations are valued at global average cost of goods as reported in year-end results. In-kind donations are valued at the value or cost of the item to GSK not the current external purchase price. Previous years' data is included for comparison but not restated for inflation or exchange rate changes. The methodology used follows the B4SI (formerly LBG) Framework for Corporate Community Investment. Value of GSK medicine and vaccines provided through our US Patient Assistance Program (COGS in million USD) The value of medicine and vaccines provided through the GSK and ViiV Healthcare Patient Assistance Programs Foundation which provides medication at no charge to eligible individuals. Patients who receive medications through the Patient Assistance Programs must meet eligibility requirements.These requirements include insurance status, a financial component based on the Federal Poverty Level, being a resident of the US, Puerto Rico or the US Virgin Islands and being treated by a US-licensed healthcare provider. The GSK and ViiV Patient Assistance Programs Foundation administers 12 Patient Assistance Programs for patients in the US, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin islands. We capture Patient Assistance Program orders for GSK and ViiV Healthcare products through an internal ordering database. The data is captured according to the Wholesale Acquisition Cost of the medicine or vaccine and is coded as 'Free Good Charitable Orders'.This amount is converted to a 'Cost of Goods Sold' amount for reporting purposes. Patient participation varies annually based on current program eligibility criteria, overall healthcare environmental factors and products included in the programs. Doses of Rotarix , Synflorix and Cervarix vaccines supplied to Gavi of doses of the Rotarix , Synflorix and Cervarix vaccine that are supplied to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. To calculate the number of doses supplied, we use the number of GSK doses shipped to Gavi supported countries. GSK has been a Gavi supplier since Gavi's inception in 2000. Doses of OPV vaccines supplied to UNICEF (millions)The number of doses of the OPV vaccine that are supplied to UNICEF.To calculate the number of doses supplied, we use the number of GSK doses shipped to countries procuring via UNICEF. Doses of Mosquirix (RTS,S/AS01 E) vaccines supplied through the (millions)The number of doses of the Mosquirix (RTS,S/ AS01 E) vaccine donated to the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP). To calculate the number of doses supplied, we use the number of GSK doses procured by UNICEF (MVIP's procurement agent) and shipped to MVIP countries (Ghana, Kenya and Malawi). GSK has been supplying Mosquirix (RTS,S/AS01 E) - the first and only malaria vaccine - since the beginning of the MVIP in 2019. Albendazole tablets donated to help eliminate lymphatic filariasis (millions)The number of albendazole tablets donated to the World Health Organization to support endemic country efforts to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. Albendazole tablet shipments are sent from GSK's manufacturing facility to endemic countries. These shipments are entered into a real-time database of donated medicines for neglected tropical diseases. Albendazole tablet donation figures for lymphatic filariasis are aggregated and reported annually through data pulled from this system. Albendazole tablets donated to help treat intestinal worms (millions)The number of albendazole tablets donated to the World Health Organization to support endemic country efforts to treat soil-transmitted helminthiasis (intestinal worms) in school-age children. Albendazole tablet shipments are sent from GSK's manufacturing facility to endemic countries. These shipments are entered into a real-time database of donated medicines for neglected tropical diseases. Albendazole tablet donation figures for soil-transmitted helminthiasis control are aggregated and reported annually through data pulled from this system. People with access to a generic dolutegravir product through voluntary licensing agreements ('000)The total number of people living with HIV currently accessing generic dolutegravir-based products through ViiV Healthcare's voluntary licensing agreements with the Medicines Patent Pool and directly with Aurobindo Pharma.As a chronic and ongoing treatment, we capture the cumulative number of people with access to dolutegravir, rather than annual data, to avoid duplication. The indicator therefore represents the total number of people living with HIV accessing the treatment at the time of measurement. As a life-long treatment, this number incorporates people that have been receiving ongoing treatment for multiple years. The number is calculated by adding the total number of packs of all generic dolutegravir-based products sold over the previous four quarters. This is then divided by twelve to obtain average monthly sales and estimate the number of people on treatment. Packs of 90 and 60 are converted to 30 pack equivalents (i.e. monthly equivalents for a daily treatment). Data is provided by the Medicines Patent Pool and Aurobindo, through which ViiV's dolutegravir patents are (sub-)licensed. Our approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix43 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Appendix continued KPI Definition Method Access Estimated children reached with Synflorix through Gavi ('000)The estimated number of children who have received the Synflorix vaccine (for the prevention of pneumococcal infection) through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. All children receiving Synflorix are under five years of age. To calculate the estimated number of children reached, we use the number of GSK doses shipped to Gavi supported countries, and divide this by the number of doses needed to complete a full schedule, with Gavi estimated vaccine wastage rates factored in.For Synflorix a full schedule is three doses, and Gavi estimates wastage of 10% in 2017 and 2018, with Rotarix through Gavi ('000) The estimated number of children who have received the Rotarix vaccine (for the prevention of rotavirus) through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. All children receiving Rotarix are under five years of age. To calculate the estimated number of children reached, we use the number of GSK doses shipped to Gavi supported countries, and divide this by the number of doses needed to complete a full schedule, with Gavi estimated vaccine wastage rates factored in.For Rotarix a full schedule is two doses and Gavi estimates wastage of 5% through Gavi ('000) The estimated number of girls who have received the Cervarix vaccine (for the prevention of cervical cancer) through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.To calculate the estimated number of girls reached, we use the number of GSK doses shipped to Gavi supported countries, and divide this by the number of doses needed to complete a full schedule, with Gavi estimated vaccine wastage rates factored in.For Cervarix a full schedule is two doses and Gavi estimates 10% wastage.See: Detailed-product-profiles.xlsx (live.com) Estimated people reached with the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) through UNICEF ('000) The estimated number of people who have received the OPV vaccine for polio procured through UNICEF.To calculate the estimated number of people reached, we use number of bivalent (bOPV) and monovalent to UNICEF, divided by the number of doses needed to complete a full schedule, with WHO estimated vaccine wastage rates factored in. In outbreak situations, which is where GSK OPV volumes are often used, one dose is usually given to each child. However, as the primary schedule is four doses and children may receive more than one dose through subsequent outbreak campaigns, we use four doses for the calculation in order to be conservative. WHO estimates 20% wastage given that we supply 10 and 20 dose vials, vials are mainly used in campaigns and vials may or may not be used or discarded after vial is opened at the end of the session. See WHO indicative vaccine wastage rates: Revising_Wastage_Concept_Note.pdf (who.int) Estimated people reached through the MVIP ('000)The estimated number of children who have received the Mosquirix (RTS,S/AS01 E) vaccine through the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP). To calculate the estimated number of children reached, we use the number of GSK doses shipped to MVIP countries (Ghana, Kenya, Malawi), and divide this by the number of doses needed to complete a full schedule (four doses), with WHO estimated vaccine wastage rates (10% for two dose vials used in routine immunisation) factored in. See WHO indicative vaccine wastage rates: Revising_Wastage_Concept_Note.pdf (who.int) People reached through our US Patient Assistance Programs ('000)The total number of unique individuals that received GSK and ViiV Healthcare product through all of our Patient Assistance Programs. Patients who receive medications through the Patient Assistance Programs must meet eligibility requirements. These requirements include insurance status, a financial component based on the Federal Poverty Level, being a resident of the US, Puerto Rico or the US Virgin Islands and being treated by a US-licensed healthcare provider. The GSK and ViiV Patient Assistance Programs Foundation administers 12 Patient Assistance Programs for patients in the US, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Each of the 12 US Patient Assistance Programs provides a report at year end, which enables us to consolidate the number of unique patients that received GSK and ViiV Healthcare products throughout the year. Patient participation varies annually based on current program eligibility criteria, overall healthcare environmental conditions and products included in the programs. Our approach Access Global health Environment DEI Ethical standards Product governance Appendix44 GSK ESG Performance Report 2022 March 2023Appendix continued KPI Definition Method Global health and health security Number of assets progressed through the Global Health pipeline to address priority WHO diseasesThe number of assets progressed through the Global Health pipeline to address priority WHO diseases across GSK's two Global Health hubs - Tres Cantos (Spain), which focuses on therapeutics, and the GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health (GVGH in Sienna), which focuses on preventative treatment. Priority WHO diseases are defined as diseases and pathogens prioritized for R&D in public health emergency contexts, which distinguishes diseases to the degree they pose the greatest public health risk due to their epidemic potential and/or whether there is no or insufficient countermeasures. GSK uses the following lists: -WHO Priority Pathogen List* -WHO Essential Medicines List* -UN Sustainable Development Goals *WHO reviews and updates these lists as needs arise and methodologies change. 'Pipeline progression' is defined as the movement of a Global Health asset from one phase to another. GSK recognises progression through the following four categories: -Senior leadership endorsement of business plan for progression -Clinical trial starts ('First Subject, First Visit/Dose') -Business development/in-licensing -Regulatory milestone (i.e. - submission, approval, or launch). Environment For a full list of our environment reporting criteria, please see our Basis of reporting , including full definitions and methodologies. Diversity, equity and inclusion Gender diversity (%) The percentage of women broken down by SVP/VP; Director; Manager and all employees. For the total percentage of women in management, 'management' classed as an employee in grade bands 0-6 which includes Managers, Directors, VPs and SVPs.The data covers the total number of employees who identify as women within our HR system, including active (Full-time/Part-time, Regular/Temporary employees) and non-active (i.e., on Maternity Leave, Paternity Leave, Adoption Leave, etc.). It excludes Agency Temporary Workers ('Contingent Workers' defined as those payrolled via recruitment agencies) and employees with no gender recorded, or if they have indicated 'Prefer not to say'. The percentage is calculated using employee numbers as of 31 December 2022 recorded in our HR system with gender specified as female, within grades 0-6, divided by the total employees in the system. US and UK ethnic diversity (%)The percentage of ethnically diverse employees for GSK in the US and UK employee population across SVP/VP level, Director level, Manager level and across all employees. Due to differing ethnic groups across the UK and US employee population, race/ethnic categories are defined according to UK Census and US Federal reporting guidelines.The data covers the total number of employees in our internal HR system, both active (including Full-time/Part-time, Regular/Temporary employees) and non-active (i.e., on Maternity Leave, Paternity Leave, Adoption Leave, etc.). It excludes Puerto Rico-based employees, Agency Temporary Workers ('Contingent Workers' defined as those payrolled via recruitment agencies) and employees with blank ethnicity and 'Prefer not to say'. The US figures exclude Puerto Rico-based employees given significant differences in ethnic composition of the territory's population relative to the rest of the US. The percentage is calculated using employee numbers as at 31 December 2022 recorded in our HR system who self-identified as ethnically diverse, divided by the total employees in the system. Ethical standards Employees who had concerns raised against them (including current year and prior year open cases)The number of distinct employees with a disciplinary concern raised against them.Anyone inside or outside GSK can raise concerns or speak to an independent third party through our integrity lines, confidentially or anonymously. Concerns can also be raised internally by employees, management, or internal monitoring. This data comprises all regular employees and excludes contractors and contingent workers. The data includes the total number of distinct employees with a disciplinary concern raised against them during the reporting period and those employees with disciplinary concerns raised against them from prior year's open cases. Employees disciplined for policy violationsThe number of distinct employees where the outcome of a concern raised resulted in disciplinary action. This data comprises all regular employees and excludes contractors and contingent workers. The data represents cases closed during the reporting period. In 2022, we also included three open cases where disciplinary decisions were made and action taken at year end; however, the cases had not yet been closed in the source system by the reporting criteria end date range due to timing. Disciplinary action includes a documented warning, termination, or resignation.

This data comprises all regular employees and excludes contractors and contingent workers. Individual employees can be subject to multiple allegations resulting in disciplinary action. Where this is the case, an individual is counted once against each unique category. Employee discipline results from policy violation, and includes Level 1 Sanction, Level 2 Sanction, Level 3 Sanction, Final Warning, Termination, or Resignation and is categorised as appropriate. Outcomes for employees including mediation, demotion and settlement are not included in counts or percentages within categories. These outcome types are not considered disciplinary action and they represent situations in which employees and the company work together towards a solution. All markets, except Germany, utilise a case management system to manage cases and data retention. The German market maintains its own case list which is submitted to the global employee relations team at year end for consolidation and analysis. Case owners regularly utilise published data quality reports to assist in data accuracy regularly. Quarterly internal audits are conducted to address any outstanding data discrepancies. Employees who were dismissed or agreed to leave the company voluntarily as a result of misconductThe number of distinct employees where the outcome of a disciplinary concern resulted in termination of employment or voluntary resignation of the employee.This data comprises all regular employees and excludes contractors and contingent workers.

All active employees (Full-time/Part-time, Regular/Temporary) and complementary workers (i.e., Agency workers, Statement of Work workers, Outsourced workers, etc.) are required to complete our global mandatory learning curriculum called Living our Code which comprises three modules: The Code, Protecting GSK, and Creating an Inclusive Workplace. Additionally, those in high-risk roles or geographic regions complete an additional module: Focusing on anti-bribery and corruption. The percentage is calculated by using training data as of 31 December 2022 (i.e., training due on or before 31 December 2022). This is calculated as the total number of active employees and complementary workers who have been assigned the Living our Code mandatory training and have completed all modules divided by the total population of active employees and complementary workers who have been assigned the Living our Code mandatory training. % of employees who believe they 'can and do Speak Up if things don't feel right'The percentage of employees that strongly agreed or agreed with the question 'I can and do speak up if things don't feel right' in the GSK Pulse survey. Pulse surveys were issued in Q2, Q3 and Q4 2022. A different third of the organisation is targeted by each survey so that the entire employee population of GSK is reached. The score is calculated by using the average score across the surveys. The survey is issued to all regular full-time and fixed-term contract employees in all countries in which GSK operates (excluding Russia and Ukraine). Questions are translated by professional service partners into 23 languages (excluding English). 80% of direct high-risk suppliers that achieve GSK's minimum EcoVadis score or have an improvement plan in place.Direct high-risk suppliers are identified on a yearly basis through a combination of spend, category and high-risk countries. Direct procurement involves the purchasing of materials directly associated with the production of goods. Out of the total number of 2125 direct suppliers, 138 are high-risk and managed through GSK's EcoVadis Programme. An improvement plan in place is defined as an ongoing improvement plan. GSK requires suppliers to have a minimum EcoVadis score of 40. Through our EcoVadis Programme, we work with direct high-risk suppliers to help them improve their operations and support their sustainability journey. EcoVadis is an external ratings provider and assesses organisations across four themes: Environment & Community, Labour & Human Rights, Ethics and Sustainable Procurement. A supplier may not have an improvement plan in place because the assessment is in progress, the supplier has committed to participate in the programme but hasn't commenced yet or the supplier hasn't accepted the improvement plan. Where the improvement plan has been implemented and the supplier awaits reassessment to reflect improved score, this is reported as the supplier not having an improvement plan in place. An improvement plan is initiated by the supplier or any of its partners, including GSK, and tracked on the EcoVadis platform. Where required, GSK interacts directly with the supplier to ensure corrective actions are implemented. EcoVadis scorecard data is exported from the EcoVadis platform. In 2022, five suppliers were manually adjusted to group or subsidiary based on the business relationship.

The number of trial results summaries posted on the external facing GSK trial register (www.gsk-studyregister.com) as part of GSK's internal policy commitment to disclosure of human subject research. This is in addition to the mandatory requirements by regulators for disclosure of results summaries. We report the cumulative number of studies which have protocols registered or results disclosed since the set-up of the GSK trial register in 2004. Studies for which protocol summaries were registered and results summaries were disclosed by GSK are available on the GSK trial register (www.gsk-studyregister.com). The numbers represent the studies which were initiated in 2022 and for which protocol were registered and completed studies with results summaries due in 2022. These numbers are generated through the Transparency report which derives the data from the disclosure system used by the business. People disclosures Overall turnover (%) Overall turnover is a measure of GSK employees leaving GSK and does not include internal moves within GSK. The data does not include divestments, including employees divested from the Consumer Health business in 2022. We calculate the number of leavers during the year as a percentage of the average 2022 permanent headcount. The employee turnover rate includes employees who left the company both voluntarily and involuntarily during the year. The data is updated daily and extracted from our GSK-wide HR platform. The data is based on the effective date of termination and not the termination date. The termination date is the last day of work and the effective date of termination is the first day of termination, i.e. the following day. Therefore, employees with termination dates of 31 December 2022 are not included in this dataset. Health and safety data Reportable injury or illness including fatalities Lost time Hours workedA GSK reportable injury or illness meets the following criteria: 1. T he affected individual is either a GSK employee or worker under direct GSK daily supervision; and 2. T he incident is work-related; and 3. T he outcome has involved at least one of the following: -Fatality; -Loss of consciousness; -Medical treatment beyond first aid; -Significant occupational injury or occupational illness diagnosed by a physician or other licensed healthcare professional; -Days away from work/restricted days/job transfer; and 4. M ust be a new case. A lost time incident is one that has resulted in either days away from work or a job transfer or restriction when the employee is unable to perform one or more routine activities. The total number of hours worked by all employees including full time employees and directly supervised agency staff.To be consistent in our global reporting, a GSK injury or illness meets these listed criteria. These criteria are different from national regulatory reporting requirements which vary across the world. Lost time days are counted from the day following the incident. Hours worked is calculated based on the number of working days in a year, the length of an average workday, and the number of employees by site as provided by GSK Human Resources.

Inherent limitations exist in all assurance engagements. Any internal control structure, no matter how effective, cannot eliminate the possibili ty that fraud, errors or irregularities may occur and remain undetected and because we use selective testing in our engagement, we cannot guarantee that errors or irregularities, if present, will be detected. The Applicable Criteria as defined by GSK plc within the ir Basis of Reporting , the nature of the Selected Information, and absence of consistent external standards allow for different, but acceptable, measurement methodologies to be adopted which may result in variances between entities. Th e adopted measurement methodologies may also impact comparability of the Selected Information reported by different organisations and from year to year within an organisation as methodologies develop.

The ICAEW Code is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. We applied the International Standard on Quality Management 1 (\"ISQ M 1\"), issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
