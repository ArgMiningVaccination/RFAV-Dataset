What follows is a compilation of expert quotations on precisely this topic, cited from some of the most authoritative books and authors in the world. Feel free to cite this information in your own book or website. Be sure to cite the original author and source. An excellent summary study of Spirulina was done in 2002. The authors summarized the many potential benefits of Spirulina: \"Spirulina has been experimentally proven, in vivo and in vitro that it is effective to treat certain allergies, anemia, cancer, hepatotoxicity [toxicity of the liver], viral and cardiovascular sugar], hyperlipidemia [high cholesterol and processes, among others. - [Spirulina: Nature's superfood](http://www.naturalpedia.com/book_Spirulina_Natures_Superfood.html) by Kelly J Moorhead Unlike other algaes, the cell wall of spirulina has high concentrations of mucopolysaccharides, which are easily digested and form glycoprotein complexes that are important in the formation of protein and the building of cell membranes. Primitive foods such as spirulina contain the highest food energy, the highest nutrient value, and use up the least amount of the planet's resources. Spirulina is also a powerful alkalinizing and healing food. It is an excellent support for the healing of hypoglycemia, diabetes, chronic fatigue, anemia, ulcers, and for boosting the immune system. - [Conscious Eating](http://www.naturalpedia.com/book_Conscious_Eating.html) by Gabriel Cousens, M.D. Spirulina and other micro-algae are excellent remedies for most cases of anemia, and B12 is essential for building red blood. Most cases of anemia, however, are not merely a result of B12 deficiency alone; it may be that the massive amounts of chlorophyll, iron, protein, and other nutrients in micro-algae overcome [anemia](https://www.naturalnews.com/anemia.html) . In our personal experience, we have observed many people who have taken various micro-algae regularly for a decade or more, and when other sources of B12 are included in the diet, B12 deficiency does not arise. - [Healing with Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition](http://www.naturalpedia.com/book_Healing_with_whole_foods.html) by Paul Pitchford A third of an ounce (10 g) of spirulina powder is enough to cover the daily need for vitamin B12 five times over, four times that for vitamin A, 83 percent of the daily requirement for iron, 30 percent of vitamin B2, and 25 percent of vitamin Bj. Spirulina is particularly recommended for fatigue, anemia, eyesight problems, menstrual problems, and skin disorders. In addition, it helps strengthen the immune system and facilitates the elimination of toxins that have collected inside the body. It comes in the form of a deep-green powder with a faint aroma, and also in tablets or capsules. - [Healing with Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition](http://www.naturalpedia.com/book_Healing_with_whole_foods.html) by Paul Pitchford It is a rich source of amino acids, chlorophyll, B vitamins, GLA, carotenoids, and other nutrients. Spirulina has been shown to have immune-enhancing effects, it detoxifies heavy metals, and it protects against radiation sickness. A phytonutrient in spirulina known as phycocyanin has been shown to stimulate the production of blood cells. - [Prescription for Natural Cures: A Self-Care Guide for Treating Health Problems with Natural Remedies Including Diet and Nutrition, Nutritional Supplements, Bodywork, and More](http://www.naturalpedia.com/book_Prescription_for_Natural_Cures.html) by James F. Balch, M.D. and Mark Stengler, N.D. Hycocyanin, a phytonutrient found in spirulina, has been shown in animal studies to stimulate the bone marrow to produce blood cells more effectively. Spirulina is considered a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. Avoid the use of iron sulfate (ferrous sulfate), which is poorly absorbed and can cause digestive upset. - [Prescription for Natural Cures: A Self-Care Guide for Treating Health Problems with Natural Remedies Including Diet and Nutrition, Nutritional Supplements, Bodywork, and More](http://www.naturalpedia.com/book_Prescription_for_Natural_Cures.html) by James F. Balch, M.D. and Mark Stengler, N.D. Wild blue-green excels for lifting bad moods; spirulina, chlorella, and cereal grass are also useful. Anemia: All cereal grasses and green micro-algae discussed in this section are good blood tonics, but [spirulina](https://www.naturalnews.com/spirulina.html) and chlorella are best for building up blood deficiency caused by weak digestive absorption and poor spleen-pancreas function, because these micro-algae are less cooling and cleansing than wild blue-green and wheat or barley grass. - [Healing with Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition](http://www.naturalpedia.com/book_Healing_with_whole_foods.html) by Paul Pitchford Spirulina is available in powder, capsules, and tablets, and is sometimes found as liquid extracts or flakes. For purposes of prevention, most people benefit from a \"standard\" 10-gram dosage: one heaping teaspoon of powder or 5 grams of tablets, twice a day. Double this amount (20 grams/day) is normally an effective upper dosage range for imbalances such as diabetes, hypoglycemia, cataracts, and anemia. More than this, however, is not toxic. Athletes and others with large energy requirements sometimes take 20 grams two or three times a day. - [Healing with Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition](http://www.naturalpedia.com/book_Healing_with_whole_foods.html) by Paul Pitchford Receive Our Free Email Newsletter Get independent news alerts on natural cures, food lab tests, cannabis medicine, science, robotics, drones, privacy and more.
