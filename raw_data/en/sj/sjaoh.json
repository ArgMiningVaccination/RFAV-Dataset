Go Bears! ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY | 5 University of Northern Colorado Traditions The University of Northern Colorado has a rich and dynamic 133 -year history. As the university has evolved and grown with each generation of Bears, many favorite traditions have emerged to celebrate the s pirit, community and diversity that make UNC a special place for all of us. Homecoming UNC alumni first celebrated Homecoming in 1923 and have returned to Greeley 's campus every fall since. This annual celebration, held in conjunction with a home football game (Go Bears!), includes weeklong student spirit activities, an evening pep rally and bonfire with the Pride of the Rockies Marching band, and alumni gatherings across campus. Cranford Cornerstone Much celebration surrounded the laying of the cornerstone of the first building constructed at the new State Normal School in Greeley in 1890. The building was later named Cranford Hall after the businessman who donated most of the land for the school. Although the building was ravaged by time and a fire and had to eventually be demolished in 1972, its cornerstone was salvaged and is prominently displayed near the west entrance to Carter Hall as a reminder of our historic founding. Gunter Hall During Gunter Hall 's renovation in 1996, architects salvaged as many of the 1928 building 's historic features as possible, including the center court of the gym floor, original wall murals and the famous Gunter bells, which had been replaced three times prior to the renovation. Today the bells ring electronically, but no le ss proudly to mark the passage of time across campus as they have for generations of UNC students. Hi Bridge A gift from the 1940 senior class, Hi Bridge is located between Gunter Hall and Gray Hall and originally led to the front door of Bru Inn, the form er student union. The bridge established the tradition that anyone who crossed it, friend or stranger, were to greet each other with a cordial \"Hi.\" Today, undergraduate students apply to become a Hi Bridge Society delegate, representing UNC hospitality at its best at numerous alumni and community events. Delegates are named and recognized during the annual Homecoming celebration. Becoming the Bears Until 1925, the official name of the university 's athletic teams was the Teachers. The following year, our ma scot became a brown Bear, in recognition of the bear carving atop an Alaskan Tlingit totem pole that was part of the Greeley campus since 1914. Nicknamed \"Totem Teddy, \" it served as a school symbol until 2003, when it was properly returned to the Tlingit t ribe under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. The bronze statue Northern Vision now serves as the visual representation of UNC 's beloved Bear identity and mascot. Northern Vision Since 2004, Northern Vision , our 12 -foot-high, 2,00 0- pound, bronze sculpture of a bear on the north lawn of the University Center (UC), has watched intently over our campus community. Created and donated by local sculptors at the behest of a cadre of persuasive UNC alumni, the eye -catching piece of art fac es southeast toward the UC, the vibrant hub for student life, symbolizing the university 's focus on students. Northern Vision is a favorite photo spot to capture two iconic UNC moments \u2014the conclusion of a student 's first campus tour and a student 's commenc ement photo in cap and gown regalia.

Graduate study at UNC involves the graduate student studying under the direction of a qualified member of the graduate faculty. Thus, graduate credit is awarded for courses of study taught by duly appointed members of the graduate faculty who meet th e criteria established by the faculty constitution and the bylaws of the graduate faculty. The exchange of information, ideas and values that takes place between the graduate faculty and highly qualified students is the essence of graduate education. Gradu ate students must display evidence of superior academic aptitude, achievement and motivation. Moreover, graduate students demonstrate competence in their discipline through a variety of measures: professional demeanor, written and oral exams, directed stud ies, internships, research projects, theses, capstones and/or dissertations. These measures are an integral part of the graduate education experience. Through cooperative efforts of the graduate faculty, the Graduate Council and the Graduate School, the un iversity seeks to establish an environment in which graduate students and the graduate faculty can achieve the goals of a 21st century graduate education. Rules and regulations contained herein are intended to help the graduate faculty and the graduate stu dent to accomplish the intent and purposes of graduate education. The Graduate Catalog contains the policies and procedures consistent with policies of the Board of Trustees and University Regulations. These policies and procedures are informed by the Grad uate Council and govern the Graduate School, graduate programs, graduate faculty and graduate students. Graduate Council It is the responsibility of the Graduate Council to recommend policies governing graduate programs and requirements at the university. It sets minimum standards for admission to the Graduate School at UNC. The council is comprised of representatives from the graduate faculty drawn from all colleges who are elected to serve three -year terms. Graduate Faculty Graduate faculty are appointed by the University President, or their designee, after being recommended by the academic unit, the academic dean, the Graduate Council and the Graduate Dean.

A faculty member who has retired and is currently serving as a research advisor on a doctoral committee can continue to serve as research advisor, but they must apply for and be granted Emeritus Graduate Faculty (EGF) prior to retirement. Upon approval by the school or department, the academic dean and the dean of the Graduate School selected individuals may be appointed as graduate lecturers for a four-year period. These faculty members may teach specific c ourses that are approved and/or perform other designated graduate responsibilities. Graduate credit can be granted for courses taught by a faculty member who has been appointed to the graduate faculty or to the graduate lecturer faculty. No graduate credit can be granted for any course taught by a current graduate student at this institution. Graduate faculty members are noted in the listing of UNC faculty in this publication.

Admissions Admissions to the UNC Graduate School is a two -step process; individuals are recommended by a program to the Graduate School and then admitted by the Graduate School to the University. Official Admission Official admission is extended to all applicants who meet all Graduate School requirements and are recommended by the program for admission. Some applicants may be admitted to programs with a stipulation that they meet additional requirements in order to remain enrolled. The Graduate School describes these additional requirements as: Document Requirements Applicants may be admitted pending submissions of required documents specified by the Graduate School (i.e. , transcripts showing degree conferred ) before the end of their first semester of graduate coursework. No student will be permitted to register for an additional semester, receive financial aid or take the comprehensive examination or its equivalent unless the specified requirement(s) is met. Failure to meet the condition(s) within the specified time frame will result in the closure of the student 's program by the Graduate School. Applicants admitted based on the requirement to complete a degree in progress must still provide an official transc ript within the first semester of enrollment at UNC showing their degree conferred and a GPA of at least 3.0. If the transcript showing degree conferred reports a cumulative GPA less than 3.0, applicants will be given additional academic requirements, defi ned by the program, which must be met within one calendar year, to remain enrolled at UNC. Program Requirements When a program recommends an applicant for admission who does not meet UNC 's Graduate School standards, the program faculty must provide specific requirements in writing to the Graduate School. These requirements include a list of measurable academic and professional/behavioral requirements the student must attain in the first calendar year of program enrollment in order to remain in the program. All recommendations for admission for applicants with a GPA below the 3.00 must be reviewed and approved by the Graduate Dean or their designee. In addition, the program recommending admission for such students may also be expe cted to submit a letter of justification, which is a rationale detailing the factor(s) considered in recommending the student, such as GPA in the discipline, maturity, letters of recommendation, applicant work samples, GRE scores or other compelling factor s. If the Graduate School, upon compelling recommendation of the program faculty, officially admits an applicant who does not meet the academic standards of the Graduate School, the admitted student must complete a set of measurable requirements stipulated by the program and reviewed and approved by the Graduate School. The successful completion of provisions is monitored by the program faculty, who report attainment/non -attainment of the provisions to the Graduate School. A student has one calendar year to meet all such requirements. Students are not permitted to register for an additional semester, receive financial aid or take the comprehensive examination or its equivalent unless the specified provisions(s) is/are met during the first calendar year of pr ogram enrollment. 12| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 Failure to complete the requirements within the specified time frame will result in the closure of the student 's program by the Graduate School. Denied Admission Denied admission refers to applicants who do not me et the Graduate School, program admission requirements, or both.

However, if the program has a specific start term (fall only, spring only or summer only), with approval of the program, applicants are allowed to defer their admission to the next term the program is offered ev en if that is past the one year mark. Students who have previously been granted a deferral are required to complete a new application and will be assessed the application fee.

In order for a student to begin classes, they will have t o reapply and be admitted to the program. Readmission is not guaranteed upon reapplication to the program. Program Changes Changing Academic Programs, or Adding/Removing a certificate, license, endorsement, or second program Current ly enrolled students may request to change their program from one graduate program to another, or from one concentration to another, with the approval of both departments and final approval by the Graduate School. Students should utilize the \"Graduate Prog ram Change \" form to facilitate this process. If the form is submitted before add/drop date, changes will take effect in the current term. If the form is submitted after drop date the changes will take effect in the next term. The \"Graduate Program Change \" form can be used to change your degree level to a lower level, e.g. , from doctorate to masters or masters to certificate only. If you wish to move up in degree level, you must reapply to the Graduate School. If the change is to be treated as a new program, the time limit for completion of the degree begins with the term that the request form is processed for, either the current term or the next available term. None of your previous work will be applicable to the new major. If the change is not to be treated as a new program, the time limit to complete the new program remains the date at which you initiated your original program of study. Please note that your admission to a new degree program is contingent on the approval by the program 's faculty and is not automatic. If you are denied admission into the requested program, you will remain in your current program unless you notify the Graduate School to close your file. Change of Site A student admitted to attend classes at a specific program site can submit a change of site request if they desire to be enrolled in classes for the same program but at a different location. Examples would include students who wish to move between Extended Campus cohorts e.g. , Denver Lowry to Colorado Springs, or a Greeley campus student who wishes to switch to the same program in an online format. Students who are considering making this change should contact the Bursar 's office, Financial Aid, and the Financial Awards Specialist (re garding any previously offered assistantships or scholarships) to determine how such a change may have impact on these areas before submitting this form. The form requires the signature of the program coordinator for the old site and the program coordinato r of the new site. If the form is submitted before add/drop date, changes will take effect in the current term. If submitted after the drop date, changes will take effect in the next available term. Master's Degree, Specific Requirements Master 's degrees (M.A., M.A.cc., M.A.T., M.B.A., M.B.S., M.M., M.P.H., M.S., P.S.M.) are awarded for a level of academic accomplishment substantially beyond that required for the baccalaureate degree. Programs consist of a cohe rent pattern of courses, seminars, and supervised learning experiences that culminate in a GENERAL INFORMATION | 13 comprehensive examination and, in some cases, a thesis. Master 's programs require a minimum of 30 semester hours beyond the baccalaureate degree plus additional time in preparation for comprehensive examinations or thesis writing. Master's Degree Program Admission Each applicant to a master 's degree program must: 1. Possess a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited c ollege or university. 2. Have a grade point average of 3.00 or better, on a 4.00 point scale, from the most recent degree earned or current degree in progress. If a master 's degree is in progress, a minimum of 18 credit hours must be completed for the GPA of the master 's degree to be used, otherwise the GPA from the bachelor 's degree will be used. Applicants admitted based on the requirement to complete a degree in progress must still provide an official transcript within the first semester of enrollment at UNC showing their degree conferred and a GPA of at least 3.0. If the transcript showing degree conferred reports a cumulative GPA less than 3.0, requirements defined by the program will be added to the student 's admission, just as they are for any admit with a GPA below 3.0. Master 's degree applicants must take the following steps to be considered for admissions: 1. Complete the online applications and pay the non - refundable application fee. 2. Request one official transcript from any accredited college or university where a bachelor 's degree or higher was earned or is in progress (if you have earned multiple degrees, bachelor 's level or higher, an official transcript is required from each college or university where a degree was conferred). If you received a degree from UNC, you do not need to request a transcript from UNC. The Graduate School & International Admissions Office reserves the right to request that applicants provide official transcripts from other colleges or universities as needed. Applicants who have earned or are directly pursuing a higher degree from an accredited institution without receiving a bachelor 's degree ( e.g., PharmD) may be eligible to apply to the Graduate School without the conferral of a bachelor 's degree. If an applicant intends to use Veteran 's Education Benefits, an official transcript from all colleges or universities attended will be required in order to maintain compliance with Veteran 's Affairs policies. Official transcripts from U.S. institutions should b e sent via mail directly from the educational institution in an unopened, sealed envelope or through a secure digital program from the issuing institution. Mailed transcripts should be sent to: Graduate School and International Admissions University of Northern Colorado Campus Box 135 501 20th Street Greeley, CO 80639 Electronic transcripts from U.S. institutions should be sent directly from the educational institution to: grad.applicationmaterials@unco.edu. The Graduate School and Inter national Admissions does not accept email, scanned, or PDF transcripts directly from applicants. All official transcripts, submitted as part of the application process, are retained by UNC and not returned to applicants or admitted students. Double Major Only one degree will be awarded ( e.g., M.A., M.A.cc., M.A.T., M.B.A., M.B.S., M.M., M.P.H., M.S., P.S.M.) and reflected on the transcript, but both majors will be noted. The student must specify, prior to graduation, which degree is to be used for degree granting purposes. Students pursuing double majors must meet all requirements and must apply for, take, and pass the comprehensive examination or approved equivalent in each major. No degree will be awarded until all requirements for bot h majors are complete. If a student is interested in obtaining two master 's degrees, they must complete the first degree program before applying to the other. Students may be advised by the program or Graduate Dean that it is to their advantage to seek a h igher degree (specialist or doctorate) upon completion of a master 's degree rather than obtaining two master 's degrees. Additional consultation from the student 's program advisor or the Graduate School regarding a decision to declare a double major or to s eek two master 's degrees is strongly recommended. Accelerated Masters or 4 + 1 Degree Program All 4+1 programs require students to submit an application for admission to the accelerated master 's program w hen they have: junior or senior standing, 3.0 cumulative undergraduate GPA and, have been officially accepted into a UNC graduate program for a term after their bachelor 's degree has been awarded. Upon admission to the graduate program, the undergrad uate student works with a graduate advisor to identify up to nine (9) credit hours at the 500 level in the graduate program to which the student was admitted. The student must: 14| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 Complete and submit the Petition to Count Work Toward the Next Higher Degree form to the Graduate School prior to completion of the undergraduate degree. No exceptions or appeals. Students must satisfy all requirements for both degrees. The 500 -level courses, designated for shared credit (UG and Grad) within accelerated master 's degree, apply only to the accelerated master 's degree, do not automatically transfer to another UNC graduate degree, and are approved for internal transfer by Graduate School. The aforementioned Petition confirms the nine (9) 500 level graduate credits count towards the student 's undergraduate and master 's degree. No more than 9 credits may be completed while the student is an undergraduate, The credits identified on the Petition are at undergraduate tuition rates. Graduate tuition rates apply to the remaining program credits. Students are eligible for graduate scholarships or assistantships and may enroll in 600 level courses once they hold graduate student status. Specialist Degrees, Specific Requirements Specialist in Education degrees (Ed.S.) are awarded for concentrated study and investigation beyond the master 's degree. Programs are designed on an individual basis and are sharply focused on a particular academic goal. A student entering a specialist degree program who possesses a master 's degree must earn a minimum of 30 semester hours of graduate credit. A student entering a specialist degree program who possesses only a baccalaureate degree must earn a minimum of 60 semester hours of graduate credit. Schools or programs may have requirements that exceed the minimum standards established by the university. Specialist Admission Specialist degree program applicants must p ossess a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university and have a grade point average of 3.00 or better, on a 4.00 point scale, from the most recent degree earned or current degree in progress. If a master 's degree is in progress, a minimum of 18 credit hours must be completed for the GPA of the master 's degree to be used, otherwise the GPA from the bachelor 's degree will be used. Applicants admitted based on the requirement to complete a degree in progress must still provide an of ficial transcript within the first semester of enrollment at UNC showing their degree conferred and a GPA of at least 3.0. If the transcript showing degree conferred reports a cumulative GPA less than 3.0, requirements defined by the program will be added to the student 's admission, just as they are for any admit with a GPA below 3.0. Specialist degree applicants must take the following steps to be considered for admissions: 1. Complete the online applications and pay the non - refundable application fee. 2. Request one official transcript from any accredited college or university where a bachelor 's degree or higher was earned or is in progress (if you have earned multiple degrees, bachelor 's level or higher, an official transcript is required from each colleg e or university where a degree was conferred).

Registration Audit When students audit a course, there is no need to complete assignments or exams, but students are expected to attend class. If students don 't attend class they may be removed from the roster. If students successfully complete the class, they will be given a grade of \"NC\" (no credit). Tuition and fees are charged for audited courses and the course is no t eligible for the COF stipend. To register to audit a course, the student must contact the Office of the Registrar to change their registration status to an audit. Students may not change the status for any course, including audit courses, after the add d eadline for a given term. For visiting students, please contact the Office of the Registrar at 970 -351-4UNC (4862). If you are age 65 or older and wish to audit a course, you may do so with no tuition charge (course fees may apply). Registration for an aud it may occur beginning the first Monday following the last day of pre -registration for UNC students. Registration is subject to space availability. If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact the Office of the Registrar at 970 -351- 4UNC (4862). Classes for Personal Interest Non-degree seeking students must submit a non -degree seeking application online. The application can be found at www.unco.edu/registrar/non -degree/. Students cannot have been previously denied admission by the Admissions Office. Continuous Registration for Graduate Students Doctoral Students All doctoral students are required to register continuously from the time they f irst enroll in their graduate degree program until the semester or term in which they graduate. Doctoral Students must be enrolled for at least 1 credit hour each academic semester (fall and spring) to be in compliance with this policy. Doctoral students n ot in compliance with the continuous registration policy will automatically be assessed a $150 continuous registration fee each semester. Payment of the continuous enrollment fee does exempt the student from financial aid obligations or the health insuranc e requirement. Doctoral students holding an academic -year graduate assistantship must enroll in a minimum of 3 credit hours (fall and spring); those holding a fiscal -year assistantship must enroll in a minimum 3 credit hours (fall, spring and summer) to be in compliance with the terms of their assistantship agreements and this policy. Graduate assistants are not eligible for the $150 continuous registration fee. All doctoral students must enroll in at least 1 credit hour during the semester (fall, spring or summer) they take scheduled doctoral examinations (i.e., oral comprehensive examination or dissertation/doctoral scholarly project defense) and/or intend to graduate unless they have already completed all required credits for their degree (including 797 a nd 799 credits). Doctoral students engaged in the above referenced activities but who have not completed all required credits and have not enrolled in at least 1 credit will automatically be assessed the $150 continuous registration fee for that semester; these students will not have the results of their examinations recorded and will not be allowed to graduate. Master 's and Specialist Students All master 's and specialist students must register for at least 1 semester hour during the semester they intend to graduate (including the summer term) unless they have already completed all required credits for their degree prior to the semester they intend to graduate. Students who have already completed all required credits will be automatically 18| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 assessed the $150 c ontinuation fee for the semester they intend to graduate. Master 's students holding an academic -year graduate assistantship must enroll in a minimum of 3 credit hours (fall and spring); those holding a fiscal -year assistantship must enroll in a minimum of 3 credit hours (fall, spring and summer) to be in compliance with the terms of their assistantship agreements and this policy. Graduate assistants are not eligible for the $150 continuous registration fee. All Graduate Students Transfer of credit from other institutions will not be considered in lieu of continuous registration. Satisfying the continuous registration requirement and maintaining status as a graduate student will allow students to utilize various University faciliti es or faculty time. Students should be aware that paying the $150 continuous registration fee will not meet enrollment requirements for international students or for students receiving financial assistance (including loans, grants, and assistantships). Paying the $150 continuous registration fee only helps students meet the Graduate School 's program continuation policy if they are not otherwise enrolled for credits. Failure to Continuously Register for Graduate Students Students who fail to register continu ously (i.e., enroll for at least 1 credit fall and spring terms) for one calendar year (three consecutive semesters, fall, spring, summer) will receive a letter of warning from the Graduate School at the beginning of the fourth consecutive semester of non - enrollment. At this time the student will be classified as inactive. Inactive students may be required to re -apply to the Graduate School within the fourth semester of non - enrollment, remit the application fee and be re -accepted by their program and the Gr aduate Dean if they wish to resume their studies. Acceptance is not guaranteed. Additional coursework and examinations may be required for students who are reactivated. At the close of four consecutive semesters of non - enrollment the student 's file is clos ed and may not be reactivated. Students who wish to return after four consecutive semesters of non -enrollment must file a new application for consideration with the University. Acceptance is not guaranteed. Note: paying the $150 continuous registration fee does not fulfill the requirement to enroll for at least one credit within the one year time frame. Leave of Absence (LOA) Policy A Leave of Absence (LOA) is a temporary pause of graduate study that permits a graduate student in good academic standing to postpone their graduate program for a defined period of time. In the event of circumstances that interfere with continuation of a degree program, a graduate student may apply for a LOA. If approved, the LOA allows a student to stop the term clock on a degree program and then rejoin the program without reapplying to the university. A student may be granted a LOA for a minimum of one semester and up to one calendar year for reasons, including but not limited to, medical, f amily, financial, and work. A student may request a LOA a maximum of two times during their graduate program, and the total time of all approved LOAs may not exceed two (2) calendar years. A graduate student who wishes to request a LOA shall initiate a conversation with their academic and/or research advisor to discuss how the LOA impacts their ability to complete the program (e.g., consequences of being out of sync with graduate cohort; missing required courses taught during their absence; lo ss of research resources; restricted access to laboratories or campus resources; and loss of assistantship or scholarship funding). If a student decides to request a LOA, they shall complete the electronic LOA Request Form, and affirm their understanding o f the potential implications the LOA may have on their program completion. The student shall obtain approval(s) relevant to their program: Academic and/or research advisor Graduate program coordinator, department chair or school director Center for I nternational Education (if the student indicates status as an international student) Director of Financial Aid (if the student indicates receiving Title IV funding or student loans) Graduate School Assistantships and Scholarships Specialist (if the stu dent indicates holding a graduate/teaching assistantship, Graduate Dean 's Scholarship, or other university scholarship award) Director of the Office of Sponsored Programs (if the student indicates any funding, including an assistantship, paid through a r esearch grant) Graduate Dean (or designee) After verifying that the student is in good academic standing, and terminating any scholarships or assistantships awarded through the Graduate School for the time of the LOA, the Graduate School shall forward th e completed form to the Registrar 's Office. An official LOA begins only after the student receives a copy of the request form with the Graduate Dean 's (or designee 's) signature confirming final approval. Application for a LOA must be received by the Gradua te School before the last day of classes in the semester for which the LOA is requested. A LOA shall not be granted retroactively after the end of the semester. GENERAL INFORMATION | 19 An approved LOA stands in lieu of registering for the minimum of one (1) credit hour. It is als o in lieu of paying the Continuous Registration fee. A student on a LOA cannot: receive a graduate assistantship, fellowship, scholarship, or financial aid from the university; be employed as an hourly student worker; enroll in student health insuran ce; enroll in UNC courses; take comprehensive exams; convene a dissertation or thesis proposal hearing; convene a dissertation, thesis, or scholarly project defense; and/or graduate. A student receiving funding or financial aid of any kind should be aware of consequences that non -enrollment may have on aid or loans. For a student receiving federal financial assistance, the U.S. Department of Education regulations require the University to report the student as non-enrolled when they take a LOA for one (1) semester or more. The \"withdrawn \" or \"non-enrolled \" status may trigger the beginning of the Federal Stafford Loan grace period and/or the starting of repayment of the Federal Supplemen tal Loan for Students. Upon returning to UNC, if a loan is requested, new loan applications must be submitted and an in -school deferment form must be filed. For an international student, a LOA approved by the university does not mean that the student is in compliance with visa and immigration regulations. The student should consult with CIE for more information. Student Instructions Confer with your academic and/or research advisor and relevant offices (e.g., Financial Aid, Graduate School, CIE) regarding the impact of a LOA on your financial, academic, and work -related circumstances. Confer with your academic and/or research advisor, or the department chair/ school director about any changes that may affect your program. Confer with the Graduate Schoo l on the resources that will be available to the student during a LOA. If after the above review and consultation, you choose to request a LOA: Complete and sign the electronic LOA Request Form. Administrative Actions Once the LOA Request Form has been submitted by the student, it is sent to the graduate program advisor and department chair/school director for their signatures. The Form then goes to the appropriate unit(s) for signature(s) as indicated by the student 's responses (CIE, Financial Aid, G raduate School, etc.). If the request is approved, a registration hold is placed on the student 's account. The student is not able to register for courses during the LOA period. A reinstatement form must be processed before the registration hold is removed . Important Notes When to submit the request: The student should initiate the LOA form as early as possible when dealing with a potential interruption of graduate study. The form must be received before the last day of classes in the semester for which t he LOA is requested. A leave of absence shall not be granted retroactively after the end of the semester. Cancelling registrations before the drop deadline: An approved LOA does NOT automatically cancel any current course registration/enrollment. If the student is enrolled for the term(s) included in the approved LOA, they can cancel their registration(s) by the drop deadline and no tuition will be charged. Cancelling registrations after the drop deadline: If a student as ks for an approved LOA after the drop deadline, they must withdraw from any registered courses; otherwise, grades will be posted for those courses. The student will need to file a tuition appeal to petition for elimination of tuition charges. Failure to do so will result in tuition charges for which the student is responsible. See the Registrar 's website for relevant deadlines: www.unco.edu/registrar/registration/add - drop-withdrawal.aspx Financial support: If a student receives financial aid and/or schola rships from the University, they should contact the office from which support was given (department, graduate assistantship, Financial Aid, faculty member, ORSP managing grant funding, etc.) to determine if a LOA affects the status of the funding. Extern al financial support (from private funding sources): If a student receives funding from a source outside the University, they should contact the source to determine if a LOA affects the status of the funding. International student: The student must conta ct CIE to determine if the LOA affects their visa or immigration status. Dual program student: If a student is enrolled in a dual program, they must request a LOA from each program, and prior to their return, must request reinstatement from each program/ department/school. Reinstatement after LOA: If a student obtains an approved LOA, they are eligible for reinstatement provided that they: 20| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 discuss reinstatement and progress in their degree program with their, academic and/or research advisor, or depart ment chair/school director; apply for reinstatement by completing the Reinstatement Application Form; apply for reinstatement to the same major and degree; and do not request to be reinstated in the same semester covered by the approved LOA. Missed reinstatement deadline: If a student does not apply for reinstatement by their LOA end date, then: the student will be notified by the Graduate School that their LOA has ended; the student will be charged the Continuous Registration fee each sem ester for up to three semesters (including summer) of non -enrollment; the student 's term clock will restart; and after three (3) semesters of non -enrollment, the student 's program becomes inactive and the student must reapply for admission to the degre e program. LOA limitations: A student may apply for the LOA twice during the same degree program. The total time of all approved LOAs may not exceed two academic years. Notification: The student, and all who signed the LOA Request Form, are notified of the final decision by email. Registration hold: A registration hold is placed on the student 's account for the approved LOA period. The student may not register for courses until they have applied, and been approved for, reinstatement. Directed Study an d Non -Scheduled Courses Directed Study Course Directed Study courses are available in most disciplines. These are identified within this publication by course number 622. The Di rected Study course provides a vehicle to allow a qualified student to receive University credit for an individualized investigation under the direct supervision of a UNC faculty member. For more information, refer to the UNC Catalog or contact the Office of the Registrar, (970) 351 -4862. Because Directed Study courses with the number 622 are at the graduate level, the faculty member providing the supervision must be approved to teach graduate -level courses. No faculty member will be authorized to supervise a Directed Study during a semester that they are not actually employed on -campus at UNC. The investigation must be on a specific topic that is not duplicated by an existing course within the University 's curriculum. The nature of the study must involve in tensive use of relevant literature, materials, or techniques, and the study report must reflect a synthesis of the information or techniques acquired. The following policies apply for registration in Directed Study courses: 1. An individual Directed Study course may be for no more than 4 semester hours of credit per academic semester. Students enrolled in more than one Directed Study course may take no more than six credits in any semester. A study may be further limited to the maximum number of credits lis ted in this catalog. 2. The student should apply through the program in which they are doing the study. 3. Permission to engage in a Directed Study for credit must be approved by the faculty member supervising the study, and the school director/department chair of the major program. The Directed Study form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar at the time of enrollment. A rationale for course credit form should be completed and filed in the academic program office. Forms are available only throug h the school/department in which the study is supervised. 4. A maximum of nine semester hours, individually or in combination, of courses numbered 508, 513 or 622 may be counted toward a graduate degree. Separate policies exist for distribution of critique d and graded copies of a completed Directed Study, based on whether the study was completed at the graduate or undergraduate level. A student should consult with either the Graduate School or the dean of the college in which the Directed Study is to be und ertaken for the appropriate policy. Students receiving graduate credit for a 622 -numbered course must submit two copies of a final report to the supervising faculty member. While the final report may be in the nature of a scholarly research paper, it may also take the form of a report or a s ummary of activities undertaken. The format and writing style of the final report must be in keeping with the style manual used by the discipline concerned. It is the student 's responsibility to acquire the appropriate style manual for reference. The facul ty member must submit one copy of the final report to the appropriate office with the final grade assignment. Non-Scheduled Courses Courses that were approved through the institutional curriculum approval process and reside in the academic catalog may be offered as non -scheduled courses. Non-scheduled courses are offered in one of the following situations, either the course is not being offered during a particular term and the student needs the course to graduate or the course is offered at a time the student cannot attend and the student needs the course to graduate. GENERAL INFORMATION | 21 Permission to register for a non -scheduled course(s) must be approved by the faculty member and the school director/department chair of the major program. A Non - Scheduled Course form for each course must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar by the appropriate semester add deadlines. Orientation An orientation for new graduate students is held prior to fall semester and provides information about important services, issues, and policies for graduate students. For information about the orientation, please call the Graduate School and International Admissions Office at (970)351 - 2831, after July 1st.

Student Resources Financial Aid The Office of Financial Aid (OFA) administers and distributes aid in the form of grants, scholarshi ps, employment and loans to help students (families) meet college costs (tuition, fees, books, room, board and transportation). For more information, visit the financial aid office web page at www.unco.edu/financial -aid/. The OFA administers federal, state , institutional and private sources of aid. Applying for Financial Aid Most UNC financial aid at the graduate level consists of Federal loans, institutional Graduate Assistants, Teaching Assistants, Graduate Research Assistants with limited scholarships an d state graduate grant funding. To qualify for Federal loans, students should complete the FAFSA form online at https://studentaid.gov/h/apply -for-aid/fafsa. With completion of the FAFSA, the university will consider a student to have applied for all feder al and state aid programs. The FAFSA should be completed by June 1 priority deadline each year to maximize the amount of aid a student can receive. UNC scholarships can require both need and merit evaluation (see Apply for Scholarships for information on a pplying). FAFSA or UNC Scholarship applications processed after June 1 are considered late, and the applicant will have limited funding opportunities. Apply for Scholarships Students must be admitted to UNC and complete the UNC Scholarship Application by J une 1 to be considered for most scholarships. Even though eligibility for some UNC scholarships is based on information obtained from the admission application, students are strongly encouraged to complete the UNC Scholarship Application each year before t he June 1 deadline. The application can be filled out online through Ursa. A listing of all scholarships available through UNC is located at www.unco.edu/financial -aid/. Comprehensive lists of local and national scholarships are available through web searc hes. Students are encouraged to use a free and reputable search site for scholarship listings on the internet. Research your choices and use caution. Contact the financial aid office if you have concerns. Scholarship funds do not have to be repaid and as s tated earlier, are awarded on the basis of academics, talent and/or performance. Other criteria often exist for an individual scholarship and are set by the donor. GENERAL INFORMATION | 25 Award Financial aid is awarded based on need and may include a package of grants, scholarshi ps, employment and loans. Most financial aid is available in limited amounts to help students finance school expenses. However, while college costs continue to rise, federal and state aid does not rise at the same rate. Consequently, families must increasi ngly rely upon their own funds to pay for school. Students are expected to arrive on campus with funding for books, tuition, fees, housing, and utility deposits as well as other expenses associated with the beginning of the year. Financial aid funds are us ually available at the beginning of each semester as a credit to charges on the student 's bill. A refund will be deposited in the student 's checking account if the aid exceeds all institutional charges. Financial aid awards are typically offered for an aca demic year (fall/spring). Summer session financial aid may be available. Please consult the OFA website in March of each year to determine appropriate steps to take. A FAFSA is required for each academic year. The student 's academic progress, as well as fi nancial need, determine the continuance of funding. Grant Funds Grant funds are awarded based on financial need. The core grant fund available at UNC is the Colorado Graduate Grant. This grant is funded by the Colorado General Assembly. Eligibility for thi s grant is based upon Colorado residency and demonstrated need (FAFSA) for specific programs. Program eligibility is determined by the State of Colorado. Grant funds do not require repayment unless a student fails to complete the term of enrollment. Gradua te Assistants, Teaching Assistants, Graduate Research Assistants Graduate assistantships are available through individual academic and administrative departments after a student has been admitted to a graduate degree program at UNC. Awards are comprised of a monthly stipend and/or a tuition waiver, based proportionally in exchange for a work assignment. These tax qualifying awards are disseminated according to individual program budgets. For more information, students should contact their program. Graduate Assistantship Policies Graduate teaching assistants may not provide instruction to other graduate students without the faculty member of record present. Students appointed as graduate part -time instructors may teach undergraduate students as instructors of record. Students holding GTA -B appointments may support graduate faculty in graduate classes but are not to be solely responsible for class instruction or grading. Students classified as GTA -A, Graduate Part -time Instructor of Record and GTA -B must attend the mandatory Graduate Teaching Assistant Conference each fall or forfeit a portion of the stipend. All GTAs new to UNC must attend the New Graduate Student Orientation scheduled prior to the start of classes unless they are in an exclusively online progr am. Online students are to review the New Graduate Student Interactive Orientation: https://indd.adobe.com/ view/31d49483 -34d0 -4608 -9741 -5eed05c0a12. Students ' tuition and partial fee waivers are posted to billing accounts at the beginning of each term afte r the add/drop deadlines. Students who add or drop credits after the initial posting of the assistantship waivers will see an adjustment to their account after add/drop (e.g., additional charges when credits exceed those covered by the agreement; refunds w hen previous credits are reduced if such credits were covered by the agreement). Students on academic year (AY) agreements (mid -August to mid -May or 34 weeks) work 17 weeks in each of the fall and spring terms. The student must report no later than the week prior to the start of the term (fall and spring). Students confirm the start date with the department/unit. Students on AY agreements work during non -university holidays (Presidents ', Columbus and Veterans days). With a fiscal year (FY) agreement (July 1 -June 30), the student 's schedule follows the UNC calendar, including working during spring, fall and winter breaks. Students on AY and FY agreements are permitted one week of vacation, usually taken during winter break or spring break, or, for FY contracts, during the summer. This should be negotiated with the supervisor. With the consent of their supervisors, students working over winter break or spring break may work on campus or from home. Terms and Conditions of the Assistantship Agreement Tuition and partial fee waivers associated with a graduate assistantship are considered student financial resources, and an adjustment may be necessary in other financial aid received from the university through the Office of Financial Aid, the Graduate School, or your program (i.e. , total loan amount awarded may be reduced). Stipend is deemed taxable compensation. Any tuition remission shall be in the form of financial aid, provided independently of the s tipend as qualified tuition reduction given for educational purposes, and shall not be deemed taxable compensation pursuant to section 117 of the Internal Review Code of 1986. You can view your tuition information at www.unco.edu/acctservices/bursar/eBills /. The student agrees to not accept any additional offers for the academic year covered by the agreement such as: Assistantships from any other graduate programs or administrative units unless the director/chair/supervisor of the initial appointing unit is notified of such an offer and the student has received a written release from the director/chair/supervisor. 26| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 If a student is permitted to accept a second assistantship appointment, the combination of the two appointments must not exceed a total of 20 hours per week. A student holding a full -time graduate assistantship in any form may not engage in other positions for stipend at the university. A student holding a half -time graduate assistantship in any form may secure other positions for salary at th e university not to exceed 30 hours. The assistantship is conditional upon: Admission to the Graduate School and a graduate degree program at UNC. Maintenance of good academic standing at UNC (at least a 3.0 cumulative grade point average ) each semeste r. The student may not be on academic probation and must attend class on a regular basis throughout the semester. Should a student 's GPA fall below the 3.0 standard at the close of the term, the assistantship for the following semester will be reassigned t o another student to allow the former graduate assistant to improve their GPA. Continuous enrollment in credits related to the degree program \u2014 between 3 and 10 graduate credit hours during each fall and spring semester \u2014 while the agreement is in effect . Fiscal year agreements pay up to 6 credit hours in the summer term. Students must be registered on the first day of classes, or their stipend and tuition will not pay until they are registered. Exceptions to this requirement must be approved in writing by the college dean or assistant vice president of the appointing unit and the dean of the Graduate School. Students who enroll in only dissertation credits (799) will be allowed to hold an assistantship for a maximum of two consecutive semesters provid ed that they enroll in a minimum of 6 credit hours of 799 each semester. Students are ineligible for any assistantship when they have three consecutive semesters in which they have enrolled only in dissertation credits. Student completion of all duties a ssigned by the appointing unit(s) in a satisfactory manner and within compliance of the UNC Code of Conduct. The stipend is not a scholarship award, but rather compensation for the performance of services. Failure to perform the assigned services, withdraw al from the university, or failure to meet the above described conditions may be grounds for termination of the agreement, which shall terminate the stipend payable under the agreement. Such termination also shall result in forfeiture of further tuition re mission, and may result in repayment requirements, as noted in the university policy on withdrawal/cancellation of charges. If payments of stipend or tuition are accepted after the date of termination, the student is responsible for repayment. Student Empl oyment UNC offers several employment opportunities for graduate students. Federal work study programs can provide on - and off-campus jobs to graduate students demonstrating financial need. Students must contact the Office of Student Employment to evaluate consideration for this type of assistance. Students who do not qualify for work study programs can find part -time hourly positions both at the university and off campus. Aid received as part of a work program does not need to be repaid. Educational Loans UNC participates in the following programs: Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan. Eligibility for all loans is determined by completion of FAFSA. Federal Unsubsidized Stafford and PLUS loans are not based on need. PL US loans require approved credit by the U.S. Department of Education. Loan funds plus applicable interest must be repaid, usually after graduation. Each loan should be evaluated carefully and the terms and conditions regarding interest and repayment unders tood. Some loans have cancellation and deferment provisions. After being awarded a loan, a student must accept the loan on Ursa. Students will need to complete a master promissory note, counseling on the Federal Direct Loan website. Satisfactory Academic P rogress Standards Under federal regulations, The Office of Financial Aid is responsible for establishing and monitoring minimum acceptable progress for the continuation of financial aid. The standard of satisfactory progress must include a student 's total academic history at UNC, plus transfer credits. To be eligible to receive financial aid, the student must be making satisfactory progress toward a degree program, regardless of whether they have previously received financial assistance. For a more detailed explanation of these policies, the Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress is available in the financial aid office and on the OFA website. Refund and Repayment Tuition adjustments resulting from a complete withdrawal (official or unofficial) from the university may affect the financial aid the student receives. Any student withdrawing from the university who has received aid for that semester may be required to repay the financial aid. For a more detailed explanation of these policies, refer to \"Retur n of Title IV Fund Policy \" at www.unco.edu/financial -aid/. Credit balances generally are returned to financial aid accounts.

Petitions can be submitted to the Tuition Classification Officer in the Office of the Registrar no later than two weeks prior to the first day of classes for the given term that the student desires a change in classification. Under except ional circumstances, petitions may be accepted up to the 1st day of the semester. Tuition classification changes cannot be applied retroactively to previous term(s). Any student who is denied in -state classification after petitioning may appeal that decisi on in writing to the Tuition Classification Appeals Committee. The appeal must be submitted to the Tuition Classification Officer no later than 10 days after the denial has been sent to the student. The decision rendered by the Tuition Classification Appea ls Committee is the final University determination.

This form and other relevant information will be reviewed and a decision rendered in accordance with the state law and authorized procedures.

Policies and Procedures Academic Appeals Graduate students may appeal any academic decision that they consider arbitrary or capricious, or contrary to University policy. The procedures for appealing an academic decision can be found in UNC 's Board Policy Manual, 2 -1-2 \"Academic Appeal Procedure \" at www.unco.edu/trustees/pdf/board -policy -manual.pdf. For other types of academic decisions students wish to appeal, including course grades and program termina tion, students should contact the Graduate School to discuss the appeal process. GENERAL INFORMATION | 39 Attendance Regular class attendance is assumed. Faculty should state their specific policies on absences in the syllabus. Each instructor determines the rel ationship between class attendance, the objectives of the class, and the grade. The instructor is responsible for attendance policies and their effect on grades. Students are responsible for knowing the attendance policy of each course. Only the instructor can approve a student 's absence. Students are responsible for requesting such approval. Students involved in University -sponsored activities, including intercollegiate athletics, may need to be excused from a class, lab, or studio meeting. In all instances, it is their responsibility to present a written request for the absence. Students should be prepared to discuss how t he absence may affect their ability to meet the course requirements. Instructors should seek to make reasonable accommodations for a student involved in University - sponsored activities. Students should recognize that not every course can accommodate absenc es. Notifying the instructor of an absence does not relieve students from meeting the course requirements. The University requires that faculty provide reasonable accommodations to students who miss a class due to a religious observance. Students planning to miss a class for religious observance should notify the instructor prior to the absence. The instructor has the option to drop students who do not attend the first 100 minutes that class meets in order to allow other students to enroll. Student s are responsible for dropping courses they do not attend. Online Course Policy As with a face to face course, the instructor has the option to drop students who do not log in and do not participate in the first 48 hours from the course start date. This is to allow other students to enroll. Not all instructors will exercise this option; therefore, students should not assume that not logging in will automatically drop them from the course. Authorized University Credits Graduate credit is granted for courses taught by a faculty member who has been appointed to the Graduate Faculty or appointed as a Graduate Lecturer. With the exception of special assignments for XXX 513 courses approved by the college and Graduate Dean, no graduate credit is granted for any course taught by a teaching assistant who is pursuing an advanced degree at this institution, or a faculty member who has not been approved for Graduate Faculty or Graduate Lecturer status. Certificate Requirements A certificate is an academic title granted to a student who has completed a specific course of study. Certificate programs are administered by a college, school and/or coalition of faculty. The faculty of UNC has established min imum general requirements that a student must meet to earn a Certificate: 1. Complete the minimum courses outlined in the respective certificate program. 2. Earn a minimum University of Northern Colorado cumulative grade point average of 3.00 in the certif icate program. Certain certificate programs may have additional requirements. Complaints The University Complaints process allows students to seek resolution for what they believe to be improper or unfair treatment from faculty and/or st aff. Complaints about other students should be referred to the Dean of Students Office (www.unco.edu/dean -of-students/share -concern.aspx). Disagreement with an administrative decision, or the outcome of that decision, is not a complaint unless it alleges i mproper or unfair treatment . A different process is used for: ADA Discrimination Grievance Academic Appeals Student Conduct Appeals Graduate School Appeals Title VII -Discrimination Title IX -Sexual Misconduct/Gender Discrimination Courses Course Credit Definition of a Credit Hour Credit Hour as required by the U.S. Department of Education (34 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.2) An amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achie vement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than: 1. One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out -of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; OR 2. At least an equiv alent amount of work for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio 40| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. Base Contact Hour The faculty Base Contact Ho ur represents a standard measurement of consumption of faculty resources by students. It consists of the number of scheduled minutes of instructional activity involving direct contact of faculty with students in a given term utilizing a particular method of instruction. The standard measurement for a faculty Base Contact Hour is: Semester system term . One Base Contact Hour = a minimum of 750 minutes. This translates to a MINIMUM of fifteen 50 -minute hours per semester. The base contact time will vary base d on type of course. The required contact time is represented in the schedule of classes. Some UNC courses may be repeated for credit; they are specifically noted in the course description section of this Catalog with the maximum amount of credit allowed f or each course. For repeated courses, grades of \"F,\" \"U,\" \"NC,\" \"NG,\" \"IP,\" \"UW, \" \"W,\" and \"I\" that have not been completed within the allotted time, the credit hours are not included in earned credits. Students may audit a course for \"no credit \" but must pay the same tuition and fees as those taking the course for credit. No audit or visitor cards are issued. Students auditing a course must enroll through the Office of the Registrar before the add deadline. Students need not complete assignments or exams used but are expected to attend classes when auditing a course. If you are age 65 or older and wish to audit a course, you may do so with no tuition charge (course fees may apply) . Registration may occur beginning the first Monday following the last day of pre -registration for UNC students. Registration is subject to space availability. If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact the Office of the Registrar at 970 -351- 4UNC (4862). Course Designations Subject Each course is assigned a subject code that identifies the discipline, field or progra m offering the course. For example, course numbers in Audiology and Speech - Language Sciences are preceded by ASLS; course numbers in Mathematics are preceded by MATH; and courses in Visual Arts are preceded by ART. Numbers Four groups are identified by co urse numbers, generally to indicate the difficulty of a course and its location on a continuum of study that leads to general mastery of the content and methodology of a discipline: Basic skills - 001-099 are not counted in cumulative credits, total cred its toward graduation, GPA, nor for financial aid purposes. Lower division - 100-199 range are 1st -year (freshmen) courses and 200-299 are 2nd -year (sophomore) courses. Upper division - 300-399 are 3rd -year (junior) courses and 400-499 are 4th -year (s enior) courses. Graduate level - 500-699 are Master 's courses and those numbered 700 or higher are Doctoral/Specialist courses. Juniors and seniors with a cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher are permitted to take 500 -level courses. Undergraduates may be permitted to take courses with numbers 600 -699 if they have applied to and have been accepted into a Master 's level program at UNC. 600 -699 courses may not be counted towards an undergraduate degree. Undergraduates are not permitted to take courses with numbers 700 -799. Note: Applicability of coursework to a higher degree as an undergraduate student: please refer to specific details on the petition to count toward the next highest degree at www.unco.edu/graduate -school/pdf/Petition -to-Count - Work -Toward -Higher -Degree.pdf. Undergraduate students may not count courses numbered 600-799 toward undergraduate degree programs. Graduate students may not count courses numbered 100 - 499 toward graduate degree programs; courses numbered 700-799 may be taken for specia list or doctoral credit only. Courses at the university are sequentially numbered. Courses numbered 100 -499 are for undergraduate credit. Courses numbered 500 -599 may count as undergraduate or graduate credit. If a course numbered 500 -599 is not counting t oward the correct level, the student may contact the Office of the Registrar to request that it be changed. A course numbered 500 -599 counting as undergraduate credit cannot be counted toward a graduate degree; a course numbered 500 -599 counting as graduat e credit cannot be counted toward an undergraduate degree. Undergraduate students seeking to apply 500 -599 courses to their graduate degree must complete a petition to count work towards the next higher degree. In order to count work forward into a higher degree (for example, bachelor 's into the master 's or master 's into the doctoral) prior to completing the prior degree, the following are required: You must be admitted to the higher degree (a letter of admission from the Graduate School); GENERAL INFORMATION | 41 You must have applied for graduation for the prior degree (Graduation Office for bachelor 's or the Graduate School for master 's or specialist); And, you must file this form no later than the first week of the semester in which you enroll in the course work. Additional policies governing counting work forward can be found in the UNC Graduate Catalog and at www.unco.edu/graduate -school/student -resources /current - students/academic -policies -and-deadlines.aspx. Courses numbered 600 -799 are for graduate credit only. Courses with variable titles may have additional prerequisites assigned to specific sections scheduled. Courses bearing the designation \"gtP\" are in gtPathways, Colorado 's Guaranteed Transfer Program. These courses are guaranteed to transfer to all Colorado institutions of higher education. Courses bearing the designation \"LAC \" are in the Liberal Arts Curriculum. These courses will meet the LAC requirements for graduation. For more information, see the Liberal Arts Curriculum catalog page. Occasionally, courses that do not appear in the Catalog may appear in the Schedule of Classes (www.unco.edu/sched/). These course number end in \"98\" and are cons idered experimental. For example, an experimental course in Geology might be GEOL 398. Mutually Exclusive Courses Courses carry a mutually exclusive designation when the content of each course is highly similar or identical to the other(s). In those cases, credit will only be granted for one of the mutually exclusive courses. Courses with mutually exclusive designation have a statement that students may only earn credit for one course; e.g., 'Credit allowed for only one of these courses: ENST 356 or ECON 35 6.' Registration for any mutually exclusive variant of a course will be prohibited while a mutually exclusive course is in progress, and once a passing grade has been posted (e.g., a student who is currently enrolled in ENST 356 or has received a passing g rade in ENST 356 will be prevented from registering for ECON 356). Students wishing to apply the grade replacement policy to a mutually exclusive course must repeat the same course originally taken (a mutually exclusive variant of the course may not be use d for grade replacement). Equivalent Courses Equivalent courses are identical in content, but may have a different title or prefix. Equivalent courses satisfy graduation requirements and prerequisites. Generally, equivalent courses are used for courses wit h prefix, title or course number changes. Equivalent courses are eligible for grade replacement. Curriculum Sweep and Purge Every year during spring semester, the Office of the Registrar generates a report for review that captures courses, except for reser ved-number courses, that have not been taught in the last six (6) years. Academic Units are notified by email, including the respective Chair/Director and Dean, if any of their courses appear on this \"purge \" report. Unless the department/school specifies o therwise, the course(s) are removed from the curriculum file. Departments/Schools are asked for a written justification for those they would like to retain. Required written justification will be determined by the department/school in which the course is offered. Course Load Course load limitations for graduate students apply to any combination of all courses taken on -campus, off -campus, or on -line while an individual is enrolled as a graduate student in a graduate degree program, a non -degree certification program, or any combination thereof. Full Time/Half Time/Less than Half Time/Overload Enrollment Fall, Spring, and Summer: Full -time enrollment is considered 9 or more credit hours for graduate students. Half time enrollment is 5 -8 credit hours. Less than half time enrollment is 4 credit hours or less. An overload is more than 17 credit hours for Fall and Spring terms and 12 credit hours for the Summer term. Overload limitations apply to work completed in both on - campus and off -campu s programs. The signed Graduate Credit Overload Permit Form (www.unco.edu/registrar/ forms.aspx) must be submitted to the Registrar 's Office, 1051 22nd Street, Campus Commons or faxed to 970 -351- 1870. The Interim Winter Session has a 4 credit hour limit; no overload will be permitted. A graduate student with a GPA lower than 3.0 may not petition for an overload. Course Repeat Policy Although approved courses may be repeated for credit, some courses may have limits to th e amount of credit earned. Repeated courses are recorded on the transcript for every individual registration; all letter grades count toward the cumulative grade point average. A non -repeatable course may be repeated but will be counted in total credits toward graduation only one time. Coursework Counted Toward the Next Higher Degree While completing one degree, students may count a maximum of 12 graduate credits applicable toward the 42| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 next higher degree. Such dual enrollment is limited to two consecutive semesters. All credits applicable to graduate degrees must be earned within the time limits specified for each degree program. The initial date for the next higher degree will be the date of the first course credits counted toward that degree. Students will be accountable for the final examination in the courses taken toward the next higher degree. If a student desires to count work toward the next higher degree, they must: 1. Apply for and b e admitted to the next higher degree program. 2. Apply for graduation in the current degree program. 3. Submit a \"Petition to Count Work Toward the Next Higher Degree \" form to the Graduate School before starting any courses that are to count on the next hi gher degree. www.unco.edu/graduate -school/pdf/Petition -to- Count -Work -Toward -Higher -Degree.pdf. Undergraduate seniors registering for master 's degree work according to this procedure will continue to be classified as undergraduates until they have been awar ded their baccalaureate degrees. Credit by Course Number Graduate students may not count courses numbered 100 - 499 toward graduate degree programs; courses numbered 700-799 may be taken for specialist or doctoral credit only. Courses at the university are sequentially numbered. Courses numbered 100 -499 are for undergraduate credit, and courses numbered 500 -799 are for graduate credit. Distance Delivered Course Credit Courses delivered through alternative means (e.g., distance delivery, communications technology or computer assisted delivery) must be approved by the sponsoring school, college dean and the Dean of the Graduate School to be considered for graduate program credit. Courses s hall have a defined relationship and applicability to degree and/or licensure programs as electives, support courses, or courses that fulfill program requirements. Multiple Numbered Courses Upon approval by the Graduate Co uncil, courses numbered 400-599 may be double - numbered allowing undergraduate and graduate students to enroll simultaneously. All double - numbered courses may also be offered independently at either the undergraduate or graduate level. No course identified as an undergraduate Liberal Arts Curriculum course may be double -numbered. At least two -thirds of a student 's master 's degree program must be in courses that are not double -numbered courses or in courses that have been taught solely as 500 -level or above graduate courses. The following guidelines will be utilized in the process of evaluating new course proposals involving multiple numbering: All programs requesting approval of multiple numbered courses must demonstrate in the rationale of the course proposal the academic value of and need for the proposed course in this format. In situations where a nongraduate degree program is seeking to include a multiple numbered course in its offerings that is intended to serve other units of the university, the r equesting program must include supporting materials from those units. Nongraduate degree programs requesting approval of multiple numbered courses must demonstrate that the necessary expertise to teach the course exists in the faculty of that program. The practice will be to limit the number of graduate level courses offered by non -graduate degree programs. The specific number of courses will be determined on a case by case basis. All new requests for multiple numbered courses should try to pair a 500 level course with a 400 level course. Many course proposals are submitted with little or no distinction made in the qualitative differences between the graduate and undergraduate components of the course. It is the concern of the Graduate Council th at the significant differences in this regard should be clearly articulated in terms of all aspects of the proposed course. It is considered insufficient to require graduate students to perform the same work as undergraduate students but at a significantly higher level of accomplishment without a clear delineation of those qualitative criteria. It is also considered insufficient to merely require a research paper/project of a brief nature as the \"graduate \" component of the course. Therefore, all new course proposals must clearly distinguish, in the syllabus, the qualitative differences between the graduate and undergraduate components of the course. The significant differences in this regard should be clearly articulated in terms of expectation of outcomes, specific course content, course delivery and evaluation of work. Multiple numbered courses are generally discouraged on the grounds that the practice tends to limit the expectations of the graduate component of the course by grouping together undergraduat e and graduate level students. While this may be seen to be challenging and advantageous to the undergraduate students, the concern exists that graduate students will not be presented with true graduate level education because of \"watering down \" the conten t to meet the needs of the undergraduate students. GENERAL INFORMA TION | 43 Unclassified Course Credit A maximum of 9 semester hours of coursework taken while in an unclassified status may be used toward a graduate degree program (no more than on e semester of full time enrollment). Unclassified status refers to a student who has at least a baccalaureate degree and has not been admitted into a graduate degree program or is not seeking admission into a graduate degree program. The Graduate School ma y place holds on the registration of students who have taken the maximum hours and have not been admitted. Course registration will be suspended until an admission decision has been made. Thus, the student 's application must be complete and the program faculty must recommend either a regular admission or must deny admission by the end of the first of semester of coursework or the completion of 9 semester hours. Variable Topic Courses A maximum of 9 semester hours, individually or in combination, of courses numbered 508, 513, or 622 may be counted toward a graduate degree. Master 's: A maximum of three semester credits of 513 (Professional Renewal) may be counted toward the master 's degree. Specialist: For specia list students with a baccalaureate degree only, a maximum of 12 semester hours of 508, 513 or 622, individually or in combination, will be counted toward a specialist degree. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The University maintains an educational record for each student who is or has been enrolled at the University. In accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the following student rights are covered by the Act and afforded to all eligible students at the University. See www.unco.edu/ registrar/ferpa.aspx for \"eligible student \" definition. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) afford eligible stud ents certain rights with respect to their education records. An eligible student under FERPA is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a post-secondary institution. Each of these rights with any limitations or exceptions is explained in t he University 's policy statement, a copy of which may be obtained from the Registrar 's Office. These rights include: 1. The right to inspect and review information contained in the student 's educational records within 45 days after the day the University o f Northern Colorado (UNC) receives your request for access. a. Students should submit to the Office of the Registrar written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the Office of the Registrar, we will advise you of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request amendment of th e contents of the student 's educational records if believed to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student 's privacy or other rights. a. If you believe that your record contains inaccurate or misleading information, you may submit t he Request to Amend or Remove Education Records form to the Office of the Registrar clearly identifying the part of your record that you want amended and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. b. If your request to amend your record is denied by the O ffice of the Registrar, we will notify you in writing of the decision and your right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. This will include instructions on submitting the Request for Formal Hearing to Amend or Remove Education Records form to the Office of the Registrar. c. If you disagree with the Hearing Panel 's decision, you have the right to place in your record a written statement commenting on the information in the record and/or stating your reasons for disagreeing with the decision. Thi s explanation will become part of your education record as long as the record is maintained and whenever a copy of your record is sent to any party, the explanation will accompany it. d. FERPA was intended to require only that schools conform to fair recor dkeeping practices and not to override the accepted standards and procedures for making academic assessments, disciplinary rulings, or placement determinations. Thus, while FERPA affords you the right to seek to amend education records which contain inaccu rate information, this right cannot be used to challenge a grade or an individual 's opinion, or a substantive decision made by a school about you. Additionally, if FERPA 's amendment procedures are not applicable to your request for amendment of education r ecords, UNC is not required under FERPA to hold a hearing on the matter. 3. The right to prevent disclosure without consent, with certain exceptions, of personally identifiable information from the student 's educational records. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. a. A school official is a person employed by the University of Northern Colorado in an 44| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff po sition (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee. A school official also may include a volunteer or c ontractor outside of the University of Northern Colorado who performs an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent or a student volunteering to assist another school official in performing their tasks. i. A school official has a legitimate educational interest in information contained in a student 's education records if the information is necessary for that official to perform a task within the scope of their responsibilities that relates to the student or to the management and administration of education at the University of Northern Color ado. The information is to be used within the context of official University business and not for purposes extraneous to the official 's areas of responsibility or to the University. ii. Legitimate educational interests would include teaching, research, pub lic service, and such directly supportive activities as academic advising, general counseling, therapeutic counseling, discipline, vocational counseling and job placement, financial assistance and advisement, medical services, safety, raising endowment in support of student scholarships, and academic programs and academic assistance activities. b. Each of these rights with any limitations or exceptions is explained in the University 's policy statement, a copy of which may be obtained from the Registrar 's Office. c. The University may provide \"Directory Information \" in accordance with the provisions of the Act without the written consent of an eligible student unless it is requested in writing that such information not be disclosed (see below).

Final Examinations All final examination periods are to be scheduled for 150 minutes in length. Instructors who decide not to conduct a final examination or similar capstone exercise during finals week should notify their appropriat e unit leader (department chair, school director, program area coordinator) in writing of this action prior to the start of an academic semester or term. Instructors should also notify unit leaders of the equivalent activities to be undertaken during the 1 50- minute session of the course during finals week and include this information in the course syllabi. All students must attend the final examination period for each course in which they are enrolled. Any student who is unable to attend the final examinati on period must request alternative arrangements before the midpoint of the respective course. Approval of the request is at the instructor 's discretion. A student scheduled for three or more final examinations for one day, may negotiate a rescheduling of a n exam. The student must notify and begin negotiation with their instructors not later than midpoint of the course(s). If the parties involved cannot find a mutually agreeable time and place, the appropriate dean 's office(s) will negotiate a rescheduling o f the exam periods. Any student who fails to negotiate a time change must complete all finals as scheduled. Examinations are conducted in the same classroom used throughout the semester unless previous arrangements are made with the appropriate dean 's offi ce and the Academic Scheduling in the Office of the Registrar. Faculty should alert students to changes in the final examination times or locations no later than midpoint of the course. Full-Time and Part -Time Enrollment Status Fall/Spring/Summer Enrollment Status: Status Credits Full Time 9 Credits or more Half-Time 5-8 Credits Less than Half -Time 4 Credits or less Per the Federal Financial Aid Handbook, \"minimum standards for full -time enrollment. A student 's workload may include any combination of courses, work, research, or special studies that your school considers sufficient to classify them as full -time. This includes, for a term -based program, one repetition of a previously passed course that is not due to the student failing other coursework. The regulations specify a minimum standard for undergraduate students but not for graduate students. \" https://fsapartners.ed.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/fsa handbook/1718FSAHbkVol1Ch1.p df Note: For students enrolled in UNC's Intensive English Program (p. 30), please refer to the guidelines pertaining to enrollment status.

Grade Point Average The University operates on a 4.00 grade point system. See \"Grading (p. 46)\" in this section of the catalog, the \"Standard Grading \" table contains the grade point value of individual grades. To compute a grade point average, first remove all basic skills courses (course numbers 001 -099) and all courses that ca rry the grades: S, U, W, UW, I, NC, and grades with a period or asterisk(s). Multiply the credit hours for each remaining course by the grade point value of the grade. Total the credit hours and grade points. Divide the grade points by the credit hours. Gr ade point averages are calculated to 3 decimal points and displayed as two decimal points rounded on academic transcripts and degree evaluations. The cumulative University of Northern Colorado grade point average (GPA) is calculated as follows: The credit hours and quality points are totaled for all UNC courses within the same degree level, Undergraduate (UG) or Graduate (GR). Students determine placement of 500 -level courses toward UG or GR credit hour and quality point totals (See Course Designat ion Policy (p. 40)). GPA Example: Grade Credit Points GPA A = 4.000 3 12.000 B- = 2.667 5 13.335 = 2.939 GPA Grading Standard Grading Quality Points A = superior 4.000 A- = A minus 3.667 B+ = B plus 3.334 B = above average 3.000 B- = B minus 2.667 C+ = C plus 2.334 C = average 2.000 C- = C minus 1.667 D+ = D plus 1.334 D = poor, passing 1.000 D- = D minus, passing 0.667 F = failure 0.000 S = satisfactory - credit granted ++ U = unsatisfactory - no credit + I = incomplete + UW = unauthorized withdrawal + W = approved withdrawal + NC = no credit (audit) + NG = no grade + CR = credit granted ++ Grade* = basic skills, fresh -start, and grade forgiveness + Grade** = fresh -start prior to March 1993 ++ Grade(.) = basic skills + GENERAL INFORMATION | 47 +Credits not us ed to compute grade point avera ge (GPA) and not cou nted tow ard graduation. ++Credits not used t o compute GPA but count ed toward graduati on. \" S\" is a UNC assigne d course grade . \"CR\" is non-UNC assigne d course grade.

A \"F\", or \"W\", or \"U\" grade requires the submissi on of a last date o f a student's \"academic engagement. \" \"UW\" grades a re only submitt ed whe n the student never attended the class. As outlined b y the U.S. Department of Education (34 C.F.R. 668.22), the submi ssion o f the \"Last Date of Attendance \" is necessar y to ensure that any student receivin g a failing grade actuall y attende d the class and, therefo re, is eligible for any federal financial ai d the y may have received. As defined by the U.S. Department of Education, academic engagement is defined as active participation by a student in an instructional activity related to the student's course of study that includes, but is not limited to\u2014 Attending a synchronous class, lecture, rec itation, or field or laboratory activity, physically or online, where there is an opportunity for interaction between the instructor and students Submitting an academic assignmentTaking an assessment or an exam, participating in an interactive tutoria l, webinar or other computer -assisted instruction Participating in a study group, group project, or an online discussion that is assigned by the institution Interacting with an instructor about academic matters Academic engagement does not include acti vities where a student may be present, but not academically engaged, such as: Living in institutional housing Participating in the institution 's meal plan Logging into an online class or tutorial without any further participation; or Participating in academic counseling or advisement (34 C.F.R. 668.22)(I)(7)(i)(A) UNC is required to determine academic engagement for all students. (34 C.F.R. 668 -22(I)(7)(ii). (Also see Withdrawal from the University (p. 53)) Incomplete Grading : At the discretion of the instructor, a temporary grade of Incomplete ( \"I\") may be given if the student demonstrates that they cannot complete the requirements of the course due to extenuating circumstances beyond their control. Examples of such circumstances include, but are not limited to: serious illness of the student; accident; or death/illness in the family. Examples of circumstances that are n ot extenuating include, but are not limited to: a student 's poor academic performance in class; a student 's time management and planning; and/or a student 's lack of adherence to/awareness of University policies or deadlines. Students must have a passing gr ade in the course at the time that an Incomplete is requested unless the instructor determines that there are extenuating circumstances to assign an Incomplete. The grade of Incomplete may be assigned up through the last week of the course, which includes finals week. After an Incomplete grade is given, students should NOT register for the course a second time. A grade of \"I\" is not used to compute grade point average (GPA) and is not counted towards graduation. Degrees will not be conferred upon students with outstanding \"I\" grades. Grade change process for Incomplete grades: The instructor must submit to the department chair or school director, a written notice of the specific coursework to be completed before the final grade is determined as well as reasons for the Incomplete grade. A copy is kept in the school/department and one is provided to the student. To change an Incomplete grade, the instructor must submit the grade change request to the Office of the Registrar. Grade change requests submitted within the48| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 first six -week period of the subsequent term in which the student originally enrolled in the cour se must be signed by the instructor and the school director/department chair. Grade change requests submitted after the six -week period of the subsequent term in which the student originally enrolled in the course must be approved and signed by the instruc tor, the school director/department chair and the Dean of the College (or designee). If the course requirements are not completed and the grade change not received in the Office of the Registrar within one year after the term in which the \"I\" was assigne d, the grade will be recorded on the academic record as a failing or unsatisfactory grade. Once the Incomplete grade(s) have converted to failing/unsatisfactory, a grade change(s) will not be permitted. For more information, please contact the Office of th e Registrar at 970 -351-4UNC (4862). Minimum Grade Requirement \"F\", \"U\", \"W\", or \"I\" grades are awarded will not count towards a graduate degree program requirements. The course syllabus contains important information regarding course requirements and the grading system utilized. It is the responsibility of the students to read the syllabus and consult the instructor if they have questions. Grade Replacement Policy Effective Fall 2022, the specifications of the Course Replacement Policy are as follows: Courses repeated under this policy may not be eligible for financial aid. Veterans Be nefits will not cover the cost of a repeated course in which the student previously received a passing grade. For more information, contact Financial Aid at (970) 351 -4UNC (4862). Graduate Dean's Scholarship, graduate assistantship tuition waiver funding, and/or other institutional scholarship funds will not be applied to the cost of retaking credits. Contact the Graduate School for more information about scholarship and assistantship funding. The provisions below are not retroactive. They only apply to those courses taken no earlier than Fall semester 2022. The Grade Replacement Policy only applies to UNC graduate courses that are letter -graded (A -F). The courses taken for grade replacement must be the same (prefix and number) and both courses must be taken at UNC. The course must not be designated repeatable for credit in the current graduate catalog. Pass/Fail (S/U) graded courses are excluded from this policy. Grade replacement can only be applied once per course for a maximum of three (3) co urses and no more than nine (9) credit hours. To apply for grade replacement, the student must earn a grade of \"B -\" or lower in their first attempt. Applications for grade replacement will not be accepted for courses with an incomplete (I) grade. To use grade replacement, the student must submit a Grade Replacement Application to the Office of the Registrar no later than the drop deadline of courses being repeated. Applications submitted after the deadline will not be accepted. Once the grade replaceme nt application deadline has passed, a grade replacement application cannot be withdrawn. The most recent letter grade (A -F) attained for a course repeated under grade replacement will count toward the cumulative GPA, even if the most recent grade is lowe r than the grade being replaced. If a student applies for grade replacement and receives a \"W\" or \"UW\" in the second attempt of a course, that attempt does not count as the grade replacement opportunity and the original grade will stand. All occurrence s of a course and all grades earned for the course are recorded on the transcript. Courses are counted one time only in the total credits towards graduation. Grades counted toward a completed degree are excluded from this policy (e.g., course double -counted in a 4+1 BA to MA program). Students who plan to transfer to another academic institution or plan to apply for another graduate degree should be aware that other institutions may include all grades in the GPA calculation for admission. Students recei ving federal student loans should be aware that the Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy is separate from the Grade Replacement Policy. Changes in cumulative GPA and/or deficient hours due to grade replacement will not be considered in any fi nancial suspension appeal until the course has been completed. For questions, please contact Financial Aid at (970) 351 -4UNC (4862). If the student has received a notice of academic probation because their graduate GPA is under 3.0, they will remain on aca demic probation until grades are posted at the end of the semester. Grade Submission and Corrections Faculty must submit grades via the Web to the Office of the Registrar by 5 pm of the third working day after the end of finals week of the semester in which the course was offered. Gra de changes or corrections must be submitted within the first six weeks of the following term, and must be signed by the instructor and the department chair/school GENERAL INFORMATION | 49 director. Changes to grades for classes taken in the fall semester are due within the first s ix weeks of the spring semester; changes to grades for classes taken in the spring are due the first six weeks of the summer; changes to the grades for classes taken in the summer are due the first six weeks of the fall semester. Grade change requests subm itted after the six week period must be approved and signed by the instructor, the school director/department chair and the Dean of the College (or designee). Once final course grades are submitted to the Office of the Registrar, other than an Incomplete, no grade change can be made based upon course work completed after the term has been completed. Grade change forms are available in Ursa, under the Faculty tab. No grade change forms delivered by students will be accepted. No grade changes will be accepted for courses that have been applied to an awarded degree and/or certificate/licensure program. Immunization Regulation Colorado State Immunization law requires all University students born after January 1, 1957, to submit pr oof of two MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccines. Students must submit immunization records prior to registering for classes at UNC. Students who fail to comply with this requirement will not be allowed to register . Individuals who are unable to be i mmunized due to medical, religious, or personal reasons are exempt from this regulation when they file exemption through the State of Colorado Department of Public Health. In the event of an outbreak of illness on campus, individuals who do not have proof of immunization or who have filed a Certificate of Exemption form will be subject to exclusion from classes and residence halls and will be quarantined. The University is not responsible for any liability the student may suffer due to an exclusion and/or q uarantine. It is a UNC requirement for all incoming international students from countries where TB is endemic to undergo TB screening at the start of their first semester at UNC. Proof of a QuantiFERON TB screening test must be submitted to Student Health Services by the 10th day of classes of their first semester at UNC. Students who fail to comply with this requirement will have a hold placed on their registration. Students should contact the Center for International Education (CIE) office at 970 -351-2396 for additional information about this requirement. The Meningitis vaccine is required for freshman living in student housing, unless they read and sign the Meningococcal Information and Waiver Document. This document is provided by Residence Life and Ed ucation as part of the online housing contract. For all other students the Meningitis vaccine is highly recommended. Students interested in getting the Meningitis vaccine should contact the UNC Immunization Coordinator at 970 -351-1919 for further informati on on how to obtain this vaccine. Additional Immunization documents may be required by certain programs. UNC currently requires all students to submit Covid vaccine documentation or exemptions through the secure student portal.

Insurance Requirement for All Students www.unco .edu/student -health -insurance -program/ All Undergraduate students taking 9 or more credit hours and all Degree Seeking Graduate students taking 6 or more credits per semester, regardless of the type of class (on campus, off campus, online only) are requir ed to have full coverage health insurance. Students who meet the credit hour criteria will be automatically enrolled in the UNC Student Health Insurance Plan and the cost will be added to your UNC student bill. Students have the option to waive out of the UNC Student Health Insurance Plan by completing the online insurance waiver showing proof of comparable coverage prior to the deadline, which is always the 10th day of classes each semester. If a waiver is completed for the UNC Student Health Insurance Plan for Fall semester, the enrollment and subsequent charge for Spring semester will also be waived. If you have questions regarding re -enrollment in the UNC Student Health Insurance Plan, contact the Student Insurance Office at 970 -351-1915. Please note: All international students regardless of the number of credit hours will be charged for the UNC insurance plan. To be eligible to waive participation in the UNC -sponsored health insurance plan, UNC 's Board of Trustees, generally speaking, allows for U.S. - based equivalent insurance coverage as a basis for waiver. In other words, such plans must be comparable with Gold or Platinum plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and provide coverage for all benefits and services included in the UNC SHIP plan. All international students must follow the waiver process through the Center for International Education website . Deadline for the waiver is the 10th day of classes. Military Tuition Assistance Return Policy Tuition Assistance (TA) is awarded to a student under the assumption that the student will stay enrolled at their current institution for the entire period for which the TA is awarded. If a student withdraws before the completion of a term, the stu dent may no longer be eligible for the full amount of TA funds that they were originally awarded. 50| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 In order to comply with Department of Defense policies, the University of Northern Colorado will now return any unearned TA funds on a prorated basis. The prorate refund will be issued to the branch of military service that originally issued it. No refund will be iss ued to the student. If a student stops attending due to a military service obligation, the University of Northern Colorado will work them to identify if any solutions are available that will not result in student debt for the returned portion. For further assistance, please contact the SCOs in the Office of the Registrar, at Bear Central in the Campus Commons at 970 -351-4UNC (4862) or email va.sco@unco.edu. Name Change Application for admission to the University requires students to use their legal name. The legal name must be the name that is recorded on legal documents such as a driver 's license, birth certificate, passport, social security card, alien registration card, certificate of naturalization, etc. If a student changes their leg al name, the University will require proof of the new legal name recorded on a legal document, which can include a marriage license, adoption record with new birth certificate, divorce decree, court order, etc. The legal name is imperative at both the state and federal level reporting ( e.g., financial aid, College Opportunity Fund, employment, immigration). Name In Use A first name by which an individual wishes to be identified, that is other than the individual 's legal name, is a \"name in use. \" UNC will pr ovide a process to include a name in use for any student 's first name in UNC 's information systems. While UNC will work toward primary use of the name in use, students should be aware that the use of the legal name will continue to be necessary in multiple communications and processes due to UNC business or legal requirements and/or system limitations. UNC reserves the right to deny a request to include a name in use in its information systems if the request is fraudulent, carries connotations offensive or indecent, or violates the Board Policy Manual, University Regulations and/or Student Code of Conduct. Issues relating to such matters may be referred to the Dean of Students Office for consideration and resolution. UNC will investigate reports of misuse an d abuse of the name in use process/policy statement. Depending on the circumstances, those involved in such investigations may include Human Resources, Dean of Students, Provost, University Counsel, and/or appropriate law enforcement agencies. The universi ty also reserves the right to remove a name in use that is deemed misrepresentative and suspend the individual 's privilege to update their name in use. Pronoun in Use Information For the purpose of this policy, pronouns refer to the personal, possessive, and reflexive words that replace proper nouns in different parts of speech/communication/writing that may denote gender, and by which an individual wishes to be identified. The University of Northern Colorado (UNC) embraces the diversity of its students. A s an inclusive practice, UNC has implemented an optional process for students to designate their pronouns to the institution. It is our goal to have students ' identities affirmed and their pronouns used appropriately in every aspect of campus life. Pronoun information can be designated by the student on the admissions application or by completing and submitting the Individual Data Change Request Form found on the Registrar 's website. We encourage students to report issues relating to pronoun usage to the De an of Students Office for consideration and resolution. Depending on the circumstances, those involved in such investigations may include Human Resources, Dean of Students, Provost, University Counsel, Office of Institutional Equity & Compliance, and/or appropriate law enforcement agencies. Special Characters in Name Usage The use of special characters in an individual 's name is recognized and important to the University. All attempts are made to ensure the use of special characters in an individual 's name. However, the University uses multiple database systems, both internal and external, where certain special characters are incompatible with the database field structures requiring the removal of the special character. Name In Use/Graduation Ceremonies Students may provide their name in use at the point they apply for graduation on the graduation application. Students with a name in use on file with the Office of the Registrar, and who wish to apply their name in use for graduation ceremonies and commencemen t program publication, must submit an Individual Data Change Request Form or Graduation Application by the graduation application deadline. For information on protocols, please visit the Graduation Deadlines site. If a student chooses a name in use in plac e of a legal first name prior to the graduation ceremony, and in the commencement program (not transcripts or diplomas), and they did not make the request on the Graduation Application, they must submit an Individual Data Change Request Form. The student w ill then select the appropriate box to override one 's legal first name, and substitute the name in use for the legal first name at the ceremony. If a student uses their middle name as a name in use, we recommend that they request removal of their middle na me to prevent duplication. Should a student choose not to delete their middle name from the system, and their middle GENERAL INFORMATION | 51 name is the same as their name in use, the middle name will be omitted from the program. Please see the Name in Use FAQs for more informati on. Changing your name in use on the graduation application will also impact: Housing contracts Recreation Center Student online directory Canvas Library Checkout Career Services (Handshake) Student Email address A student 's legal name will be published on diplomas and official transcripts. This policy statement may be modified or rescinded at the discretion of UNC. Off-Campus Activity and Field Trip Disclaimer As part of the courses and extracurricular activities offered by the University, students will be encouraged to attend campus events or engage in off -campus activities as a supplement to their on -campu s instruction and education. These activities may include travel to foreign countries or other states as well as in -state field trips. Students may be expected to provide their own transportation to and from such activities, or the University may arrange o r otherwise provide transportation. Under any circumstance, however, the University requires its students to maintain appropriate insurance and be responsible for their conduct and activities at all times, on - or off -campus. The University requires its stu dents to comply with all laws and to assume all responsibility and liability for their actions and conduct while attending, being involved in or traveling to and from any off -campus activities, whether for required or voluntary activities. Parking Regulati ons The mission of UNC Parking Services is to manage an efficient and self -supporting system of parking lots for the campus. We will design and maintain our lots to enhance safety and an orderly traffic flow. We will enforce Par king Rules and Regulations so that our patrons receive the best service possible.

Visitors and short -term guests can purchase Visitor 's Permits at Parking Services or Daily Permits from one of the many dispenser units located across campus. UNC 's parking lots are enforced all year, as per the signage at the entrance to each lot. No tax revenue, student f ees or tuition funds are received or used for parking facilities. Plagiarism The following is UNC 's approved definition of plagiarism: Plagiarism is the act of appropriating the written, artistic, or musical composition of another, or po rtions thereof; or the ideas, language, or symbols of same and passing them off as the product of one 's own mind. Plagiarism includes not only the exact duplication of another 's work but also the lifting or a substantial or essential portion thereof. Regar ding written work in particular, direct quotations, statements which are a result of paraphrasing or summarizing the work of another, and other information which is not considered common knowledge must be cited or acknowledged, often by listing author(s) a nd year of the cited source. Quotation marks or a proper form of indentation shall be used to indicate all direct quotes. As long as a student adequately acknowledges their sources and as long as there is no reason to believe that the student has attempted to pose as the originator, the student will not be charged with plagiarism even though the form of the acknowledgement may be unacceptable. However, students should be aware that most professors require certain forms of acknowledgement and some may evalua te a project on the basis of form. Posthumous Degrees Students who die during their academic programs may be awarded posthumous degrees. 1. The request to award a posthumous degree may be initiated by the decedent's family, the m ajor department/school/program area, or college, as well as by the Dean of Students. 2. The CAO, in consultation with the Dean of Students, shall determine whether the student had made reasonable progress toward degree completion and did not have a signifi cant disciplinary incident. 3. If the conditions in (2) are met, the Registrar shall withdraw the student from all unfinished courses the student was enrolled in at the time of death (if applicable), order the appropriate diploma, and arrange for the deced ent to be listed in the first available commencement program. 4. The Registrar shall send notice of the posthumous degree award to the President, the CAO, and the decedent's major department/school/program area and college. 5. The President shall write a l etter to the decedent's family announcing the posthumous degree and the date of the commencement ceremony at which the degree shall be awarded. Semester System The University of Northern Colorado follows the early semester system in which the academic year is divided into 52| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 two instructional semesters of approximately 15 weeks each. The academic year (fall, spring) begins in late August and concludes in mid -May, with a vacation break between the semesters. Courses are offered online du ring the vacation break starting after fall courses have ended and finishing prior to spring courses starting. A full slate of courses is offered during the summer semester. Students enrolling in the University for the first time may do so before the begin ning of any semester. Transfer Credit A student who wishes to transfer credit from another university must obtain and complete a Transfer of Credit form at www.unco.edu/graduate - school/pdf/Transfer -of-Credit.pdf and must obtain an official transcript(s) showing the course(s) to be transferred. The student must then present the completed form and an official transcript(s) to the program advisor for approval or disapproval. If the program advisor approves and signs the form, it must be sent to the Graduate School along with the official transcript(s) for final approval or disapproval. This process must occur no later than three weeks prior to the end of the semester that the student plans to graduate. Courses requested for transfer must meet all criteria for credit transfer and be approved by the Graduate School. Transfer work is not used in the calculation of the graduate grade point average. Transfer credit will not be accepted if the work was used to obtain a degree or is include d as part of another degree at any institution. Transfer work must be approved by the school and must be \"A\", \"A-\", \"B+\", \"B\" or \"B-\" work. Transfer credit cannot be used to meet any residency requirement. Transfer credit cannot be used to make up \"C-\", \"D+\", \"D\", \"D-\", \"F\" or \"U\" grades received in required courses. Courses graded \"S/U\" are not transferable unless documentation can be obta ined from the originating institution stating that the \"S\" grade granted is equivalent to an \"A\", \"A-\", \"B+\", \"B\" or \"B-\" grade. All program requirements, including transfer work, must be completed within the time limits of the degree program, i.e., five years for the master 's degree, six years for the specialist degree, or eight years for the doctoral degree. Transfer courses must be numbered as graduate level according to the course numbering system at the originating institution. Transf er courses must be from accredited institutions of higher education that offer equivalent level degrees (e.g., doctoral degrees if transferring graduate credit into a doctoral program). The University of Northern Colorado only accepts credit from institut ions of higher education holding full regional accreditation from one of the following agencies: Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools New England Association of Schools and Colleges The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) of the North Centr al Association of Colleges and Schools Northwest Commission on Colleges and Schools Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Western Association of Schools and Colleges To find out if your previous college or university is regionally accredited b y one of these agencies, visit ope.ed.gov/accreditation/ . Transcripts received from other academic institutions are the property of the University of Northern Colorado. Transcripts submitted to the University of Northern Colorado for admission or credit tr ansfer become the property of the University of Northern Colorado and will not be returned to students, forwarded to third -party recipients or other educational institutions. Student Complaints If a disagreement regarding the transferability of credits for coursework or a degree occurs between a student and the institution, the Colorado Department of Higher Education will facilitate an expeditious review and resolution of the matter. Complaints can be filed at highered.colorado.gov/ filing -studen t-complaint. The Colorado Commission on Higher Education shall have final authority in resolving transfer disputes. Transcripts Official transcript requests are made through the Office of the Registrar. There is a fee for each transcrip t ordered. Appropriate request procedures and fee payment options are outlined at www.unco.edu/registrar/etranscripts.aspx. Educational institutions or third party transcript processors who are requesting official UNC transcripts on behalf of a student mus t submit the following: A third party records release signed by the student, no digital signatures will be accepted, which includes the student 's name, previous names, dates of attendance, date of birth, and last 4 digits of the SSN (optional). A third party may use its own record release form if it provides all the information listed above. UNC 's release form can be found at www.unco.edu/registrar/pdf/3rd -party -release - form.pdf. For additional information on ordering and how to submit requests please visit: www.unco.edu/ registrar/etranscripts.aspx. GENERAL INFORMATION | 53 Third parties who may request transcripts on behalf of students may include: Accredited educational institutions Transcript processing companies Military Law firms, legal counsel Government instit utions Third parties who may not request on behalf of a student: Parents Spouses Family members Private employers Others with no legitimate educational interest The University of Northern Colorado retains the right to deny any third party request, in which the university feels the student would be best served by requesting their own transcripts. University Withdrawal Voluntary Withdrawal from the University Websi te: www.unco.edu/registrar Pursuant to U.S. Department of Education (34 CFR 668.22), notice of intent to withdraw at the University of Northern Colorado occurs when a student notifies the Office of the Registrar of their intent to withdraw (via telephone, in person, or through written notification). The date a student notifies the Office of the Registrar of their intent to withdraw will be used as the official withdrawal date from UNC. Please note that if a student sends a letter to the Office of the Regist rar to provide notification of intent to withdraw, the official withdrawal date is the date that the letter is received by the UNC Registrar. When withdrawing from a course(s), the student will be charged 100% tuition. Current withdrawal deadline dates are published on the Office of the Registrar website. In some instances, UNC may use a student 's last documented date of attendance or academic engagement in an academically related activity in one or more courses as the official withdrawal date, if the date of attendance or academic engagement occurred after the official notification described above. Students who wish to withdraw completely from all courses in the current semester, whether planning to return to UNC or not, must contact the Office of the Regis trar at 970-351-4UNC (4862) to begin this process. Requesting information about withdrawal, such as the potential consequences of withdrawal, does not constitute an official notification of intent to withdraw from the University of Northern Colorado. Withd rawals must be completed by the complete schedule withdrawal deadline of the full semester. Withdrawals after the deadline will not be permitted. See the Special/Short - Semester Course calendar for courses that do not meet for the full semester. If a studen t withdraws from UNC due to extenuating circumstances, or an incident of such trauma and proportions that the student could not have reasonably been expected to possess the capabilities necessary to complete the academic period satisfactorily or complete the University withdrawal process described above, UNC will determine the withdrawal date that most accurately reflects when a student ceased academic attendance or academic engagement (See Grading Language, Academic Attendance). In such cases, students mus t file the appropriate appeal form located on the Office of the Registrar 's website. In some instances, a second party (e.g., Dean of Students personnel, Counselor, etc.) may provide notification of student 's intent to withdraw to the Office of the Registr ar when circumstances prevent the student from following the standard withdrawal process. In cases where a student is dismissed administratively (e.g., expelled), UNC will use the date that the institution terminates the student 's enrollment as the officia l withdrawal date. A student with financial aid should contact the Office of Financial Aid at 970 -351-4UNC (4862) prior to withdrawing to determine the effect of the withdrawal on financial aid. The website of the Office of Financial Aid may be found at www.unco.edu/financial -aid/applying -for- aid/current -student.aspx. The Office of Financial Aid will use the official withdrawal date documented by the Office of the Registrar for the purpose of calculating the return of Title IV funds. Students will receive a grade of \"W\" on the transcript for each course that has not been completed. The grade of \"W\" does not impact the student 's GPA. Grades for courses that have been completed during the current semester will remain on the transcript. Financial Aid Recipients The Office of Financial Aid will use the official withdrawal date documented by the Office of the Registrar for the purpose of calculating the Return of Title IV funds. Students who fail to attend classes may have to repay part or all of Title IV funding received. Students who withdraw from school prior to completing 60% or a term may be required to repay a portion of 54| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 the federal financial aid received for that term. Federal aid includes Federal Stafford Loan, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal PLUS Loan, Federal Pell Grant, and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant. Students may also become ineligible for future aid \u2014 see \"Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress \". Students who receive all \"F\" or \"UW\" grades will be classi fied as an \"Unauthorized Withdrawal \" and the Office of Financial Aid will use the official last date of attendance documented by the Office of the Registrar, if available, for the purpose of calculating the Return of the Title IV funds. Students planning t o leave school, it is important to follow the formal withdrawal procedures with the Office of the Registrar and understand the financial obligations. For more information on how your withdrawal will impact financial aid, please visit www.unco.edu/financial -aid/. Housing and Residential Education and Dining Services Housing & Dining contracts are for the full academic year (both fall and spring semesters). You must remain in the University 's housing program if enrolled in 6 or mo re credits. Housing and Dining Services will charge a daily rate (per diem) to students who withdraw from the University through the Drop Deadline (10th day of classes). After that date, students are charged in full for their room and board contract. For m ore information, please contact housing@unco.edu , diningservices@unco.edu , or visit Housing deposit is non -refundable after the cancellation deadlines listed in the terms & conditions for Housing & Residential Educ ation. The Housing deposit will be forfeited for all students that withdraw or are enrolled in fewer than 6 credits. Withdrawal for Call to Active Military Duty UNC will assist any student called to activ e military duty with reasonable accommodations to ensure the best possible transition to and from UNC. Depending on when during the semester the student is called to active military duty, different options may be available including university withdrawal, late withdrawal, late drops, or course incompletes. Students are encouraged to work with the School Certifying Officials (SCOs) located in the Office of the Registrar in Bear Central at Campus Commons as a primary point of contact. SCOs can help students e xplore the options available to them. Contact email for the SCOs is va.sco@unco.edu. University Withdrawal for Call to Active Military Duty During Term and/or Between Terms (Undergraduate Students): Students seeking a complete withdraw and appeal of tuitio n charges as a result of being called to active military duty, should complete the Called to Active Military Duty Form. NOTE: this form will require a copy of Title 10 or Active Duty Orders. University Withdrawal for Call to Active Military Duty During Ter m and/or Between Terms (Graduate Students): Students seeking a complete withdraw and appeal of tuition charges as a result of being called to active military duty, should complete the Called to Active Military Duty Form. NOTE: this form will require a copy of Title 10 or Active Duty Orders. Returning to UNC (Undergraduate Students): Admitted, but never attended: If a student was admitted to UNC and did not attend due to deployment, they may be required to submit a new application for admission. For deferral information, please see link. Attended UNC in the past : If a student has attended UNC in the past, had to leave for deployment, and would now like to return, they will need to: Complete the Returning Student Application to update student status. The Returning Student Application asks which semester the student plans to return to UNC. Student should work with their academic advisor for registration and planning purposes. If a student left UNC on academic probation or suspension see www.unco.edu/advi sing/probation -support.aspx. Returning to UNC (Graduate Students): Returning Masters and Specialists graduate students will not be charged the Continuous Registration (p. 17) fee for up to one year. After one year of non -enrollment, these students must complete a Graduate Student Petition for Exception form, with the support of their program, requesting that their program be re opened. Returning Doctoral graduate students will be charged the Continuous Registration (p. 17) fee for up to one year of non-enrollment. After one year of non -enrollment, these students must complete a Graduate Student Petition for Exception form, with the support of their program, requesting that their program be reopened. GENERAL INFORMATION | 55 Important note: If a student was admitted to UNC but was not able to enroll due to deployment, they may be required to submit a new application for admission and new supporting documents depending upon the original term of admission. Enrollment deferrals of up to one year beyond the original term of admissi on are allowed in such cases but must be arranged in advance; deadlines apply. For questions about the return process (for students who have enrolled) or about obtaining an enrollment deferral (for newly admitted students), please contact the Graduate Scho ol at 970 -351-2831. 56| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRAD UATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 Program Information Change of Catalog Term A student may change at any time to any subsequent catalog year as long as they attended UNC during that academic year. This change requires academic advisor approval. If a student 's major or minor has changed names in the subsequent catalog, the student m ust complete a Change of Program form. Advising Each student will be assigned an academic advisor upon acceptance into a graduate program. Only members of the graduate faculty are authorized to serve as program advisors for graduate studen ts. The program advisor is responsible for helping students be aware of and understand the expectations and requirements of their academic programs (e.g., degree requirements, deadlines, program and University policy). Program advisors are responsible for assisting students with questions regarding their academic programs and professional guidance. These responsibilities include explaining Graduate School policies and procedures, expectations for comprehensive examinations, theses, doctoral scholarly projec t, or dissertation, and internships, as guided by program, department, school, university and Graduate School as well as professional conferences and publications. Any deviations from published program requirements or plans of study are communicated to the Graduate School, in writing, by the program advisor to assist the graduation check process. It is the responsibility of the school/department to notify the Graduate School of the advisor assignment and any change in advisor assignment. The importance of t he program advisor cannot be overstated. Program advisement includes all aspects of students ' present and future academic and professional planning. It is often the program advisor who is able to help students conceptualize their academic program within the context of their own professional goals and aspirations. This responsibility is likely to involve extensive discussions of academic or professional goals well beyond the current program. Comprehensive Examinations Also see specific degree requirements. Records of written comprehensive examinations are maintained in the program area for a period of 12 calendar months. These examinations are confidential and available only to the student who completed an exam and program o r school faculty to address potential appeals and/or questions of administration and grading procedures. Students may request to review their comprehensive examination but may not be allowed access to written responses of other students. Program faculty ma y use past comprehensive examination responses as models for instructional purposes as long as all student identifications are removed by faculty. Graduation Degrees and majors are approved through the Colorado Department of Higher Educa tion. Students may not pursue both an undergraduate and a graduate degree program simultaneously without prior approval from both the Office of the Registrar and the Graduate School. Application for Graduation Students wh o intend to graduate must apply for graduation through the Graduate School. A $50.00 non -refundable graduation application fee will only be charged one time per degree and is applied to a student 's account. To apply: Application for Graduation in a Docto ral Program - unco.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6SG6Bm3mpFbqs tv Application for Graduation in a Master 's/Specialist Program - www.unco.edu/graduate -school/pdf/Masters - and-Specialist -Graduation -Application.pdf Graduation Requirements Graduation requirements are checked in accordance with the UNC Graduate Catalog and Degree Works. The student must specify the Catalog under which they wish to have their degree requirements be evaluated and must meet all published degree requi rements in that Catalog. The Catalog used to meet degree graduation requirements is normally the one published for the academic year during which the student first enrolls after admission to the university. The student may select any subsequent Catalog up to and including the current one, provided the student was in attendance at the university during that academic year. However, a student may not choose to meet partial requirements in one version of the Catalog and other requirements in another version of Catalog. See University Catalog Policy. To graduate in any given semester: The student must submit a complete application for graduation to the Graduate School by the published deadline, and PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS | 57 All graduation requirements must be completed (with relevant documentation submitted to the Office of the Registrar and Graduate School, as necessary) by the Wednesday prior to the date that diplomas are released for the semester. Degrees are not awarded during the Interim Winter Session; students who compl ete their graduation requirements in an Interim Winter Session are considered graduates of the subsequent Spring semester. Participating in the Commencement Ceremony In order to participate in a Fall or Spring commencement ceremony, doctoral students must be admitted to candidacy and all students must be on the tentative graduation list prior to the date of the respective commencement ceremony. If students have not applied for graduation they will not appear on any graduation list. Students will not receive their degree diploma until they submit an application for graduation. There is no Summer commencement ceremony; all Summer graduates are invited to participate in the Spring or Fall ceremony. Degree Conferral Policy Academic records are final upon degree conferral. Under no circumstances will changes be made to academic record after degree conferral. Diploma Release Concentration and minors are not printed on the diploma. Only the degree and major(s) are printed on the diploma. Diplomas will be released tw o weeks after the release of official transcripts. Diploma mailing addresses must be updated/provided at least three weeks before the release of diplomas. If the student does not provide a diploma mailing address by that time, the student 's diploma will be mailed to their permanent address. In the event there is no permanent address on file, the parent address will be used instead. If the student does not have an active mailing address on file, their diploma will be held for one year. After one year, a fee will be required to re -issue the student 's diploma. The student may change their Diploma Mailing address through the Update Addresses and Phones link up to three weeks before the diploma release date. The student 's diploma will not be released if the student has a hold on their account. If the student 's hold is released after the release date of diplomas, please contact the Graduate School at grad.school@unco.edu or 970 -351- 2831 For exact deadlines, please unco.edu/gr aduate -school/student -resources/preparing -for-graduation/graduation - deadlines.aspx Letter of Completion Usually, an official transcript is proof of completion of a degree. If a student needs proof of the degree prior to the availability of official transcripts with degree indicated, the student may contact the Graduate School in writing, for a letter of completion. A letter of completion can be issued only after all the degree requirements have been officially verified as comple te, including posting of grades for the current semester by the Registrar. Petition for Exception Graduate students may petition to be excepted from certain procedures, rules, policies, and requirements within the purview of the Graduate School. Students discuss the need for the Petition with their academic advisor prior to submitting the request to the Graduate School. Students may not file a petition for exception when they are actively engaged in the academic appeals proces s. The petition must include the specific policy or guideline from which the student desires to be excepted, a clear rationale for the exception, and a description of how the exception, if granted, would enhance the academic program, allow the continuation of a productive academic program, allow recovery from lost opportunity due to health or traumatic events or allow the student to profit from unique educational opportunities impeded by Graduate School regulations. Requests for an extension of program time limit, must document the specific academic and degree requirements to be completed and provide a detailed timeline for each task to be completed. Similarly, students submitting a petition to be readmitted to their degree program following termination due to failure to continuously enroll for more than one year, must indicate the degree requirements to be completed and a specific timeline for completion. Signatures of the program advisor and school director or department chair are required on this form prio r to submitting the request to the Graduate School. Faculty signatures indicate approval of and support for the request. Petitions submitted without the required signatures will be returned to the student. The Graduate Student Petition for Exception form i s available in school offices or on the Graduate School website: www.unco.edu/ graduate -school/pdf/Graduate -Student -Petition -for- Exception.pdf Program Termination A student 's degree or certificate program may be terminated for one or more of the following reasons: The major school/department recommends that the student 's program be terminated based on an overall evaluation of the student 58| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRAD UATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 The graduate student has not maintained a cumulative grade point average of 3.00 in grad uate level courses. A graduate student may not graduate with a cumulative grade point average below 3.00. If student 's cumulative grade point average drops below 3.00 after taking at least 9 graduate level credit hours, a warning letter will be sent to the student. The degree program of a student who has been sent a warning letter will be terminated if the student 's grade point average is below 3.00 after completing an additional 9 or more graduate level credit hours in which grades of \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" \"D,\" or \"F\" are earned. All grades earned during the semester which the 9th hour is earned are used in the calculation of the grade average; The student fails the retake of the written comprehensive examination or its approved equivalent as reported to the Gra duate School by the student 's program; The student fails the retake of the oral comprehensive examination as reported to the Graduate School by the student 's program; The student fails to meet the \"may pass \" conditions stipulated after the dissertati on defense or oral comprehensive exam; or The student submits an unsatisfactory thesis, dissertation or doctoral scholarly project as determined by the student 's program and the Graduate School. The following procedures must be followed prior to submitting a recommendation to discontinue a graduate student 's program for causes other than poor academic performance: The student must be informed of the pattern of behavior or incident(s) that has given rise to concern among the school/department faculty members and that led to the recommendation for program discontinuation. These concerns should be documented or, in the case of doctoral students, noted in the student 's annual progress review. A master 's student must be given an opportunity to meet with and address the observed behavior or incident with the student 's advisor or program coordinator. A doctoral student must be given an opportunity to meet with the school/departments Graduate Program Committee (GPC) or with the student's doctoral committee for school/departments with no graduate program committee. Following the meeting, the GPC or doctoral committee must either reassert the concerns or withdraw the concerns in writing to the department chair or school director. If the complaint arises from an unprofessional behavior or other behavioral concerns, the student will be given a clearly defined probationary period during which clear behavioral objectives are provided to either rectify the concerns or change the behavior. Cl ear means of assessing improvement will be provided. If the complaint results from an egregious violation of laws or published university or school/department policy, rules or professional ethics, clear documented evidence of the incident(s) must be provid ed with the recommendation. Readmission Subsequent to Program Termination A student whose degree program has been terminated may be considered for admission to a different degree program. Students may not reapply or be readmitted to the terminated program. The following policies apply: The student must apply for admission to a different degree program. If admitted, the student must complete all standard requirements of the program to which they have been admitted. A maximum of 9 semester hours from the terminated program may be counted in the new program if approved by the new program advisor and the Graduate School. If the student 's former program was terminated due to failure of the retake of the comprehensive examination or its equivalent, the st udent will be allowed only one opportunity to pass the comprehensive examination or approved equivalent in the new program. Research Involving Human Subjects Institutional Review Board (IRB) Before any research inv olving human subjects can be conducted under the auspices of the university, an Intuitional Review Board (IRB) review is required. Data from human subjects are not to be collected until written approval is received by the student from the University 's Institutional Review Board. The main considerations and responsibilities of the IRB are to assure that ethical standards and the protection of human rights are maintained in any research conducted while at the student is enrolled at UNC. Researchers are advise d to obtain and submit an IRB application early in their research process to allow time for a thorough review. Information about UNC 's IRB 's process and the link to IRBNet (the web -based IRB application portal can be found on the Office of Sponsored Progra ms website: www.unco.edu/research/research - integrity -and-compliance/institutional -review -board/. Student Liability To protect against liability claims, all research involving subject consent requires a statement informing potential subjects that their part icipation is not covered by university liability insurance. The subject consent form must include the following statement: PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS | 59 If injuries occur during the course of research, subjects are advised that the University of Northern Colorado is a publicly -funded i nstitution of higher education and as such, liability may be limited under and governed by the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act. The State of Colorado 's Risk Management Division (the unit responsible for UNC 's liability insurance) has concluded that stud ent researchers are not protected by the state against claims unless they are student employees, interns, or authorized volunteers assigned to a research project (most student researchers would not be). This means that most graduate students working on the ir master 's theses or doctoral dissertations are not protected by the state of Colorado against claims resulting from their research. This decision has serious implications for student researchers who are working with human subjects. Any student researcher who is placing subjects at some level of risk should be concerned. For example, student researchers are engaged in a variety of activities that could potentially harm their subjects (e.g., they draw blood, conduct therapy sessions, and evaluate physical c onditioning). Regardless of how responsible researchers may be, accidents can happen. Though the researcher is ultimately responsible for the health and safety of research subjects, low risk research, as defined by Health and Human Services (HHS) Guideline s and described in the Procedures for Research Involving Human Participant , may not be recommended for special liability insurance coverage. For moderate to high risk procedures, the IRB committee will strongly recommend that student 's purchase liability insurance either through a professional association or an alternative source. Master's Degree Requirements Drop of a Double Major A student with a double major may drop one of the majors before taking either comprehensive examination only if they have a UNC grade point average of at least 3.00 in the major being dropped. Once a student has taken the comprehensive examination for one of the majors, neither major can be dropped. Courses and Cr edit Hours The university requires a minimum of 30 semester hours for a master 's degree. This includes at least 24 semester hours of discipline content courses. Chemistry and Biological Sciences master 's programs require a minimum of 20 semester hours of discipline content courses. Programs may have requirements that exceed the minimum standards established by the university. A maximum of three semester credits of 513 (Professional Renewal) may be counted toward th e master 's degree. Transfer Credit Students must complete a minimum of 24 credits (80%) through the University of Northern Colorado as part of their master 's degree. Thus, students can transfer up to six (6) qualifying credits (e.g. , credits earned within the last five years, with a grade of \"B\" or better) from an accredited institution, that offers graduate degrees, into a 30 credit hour degree program. If the program requirements exceed the minimum 30 credits, students are allowed to transfer additional credits as determined by the school or program faculty (no more than 20%). Students are encouraged to check school policies regarding transfer of credit. These policies allow programs that exceed the 30 credit minimum fo r a master 's to establish school transfer limits and guidelines that exceed minimum requirements. As long as the minimum number of credits through UNC are observed, transfer credit allowances to students will be determined by program faculty and can vary o n a case by case basis. The Graduate School will not approve students for graduation with fewer than the required UNC credits. Program Requirements Thesis Committee Master 's students ' thesis committee i s comprised of at least two members from the student 's school/department who hold current Graduate Lecturer, Graduate Faculty or Graduate Faculty with the Doctoral Research Endorsement status. Master's Thesis in Lieu of Comps Whether the master 's thesis is to be completed as an additional program requirement or as a project in lieu of the written comprehensive examination, a thesis committee is required. If the thesis is in lieu of the written comprehensive examinati on, school/department procedures for determining eligibility are used prior to conducting the thesis research. Thesis committee members must sign the final document indicating successful completion of the thesis. If the master 's thesis is required in addit ion to the comprehensive examination, the student needs to submit the thesis signed by two graduate faculty members to the Graduate School upon completion for an editorial review. The Graduate Dean will be the final approval signature on the thesis. If the student plans to complete a thesis, whether in lieu of the comprehensive examination or in addition, the student must register for a minimum of six (6) semester hours of 699-Thesis. No more than six hours of thesis may be applied to the minimum credit req uirements of a student 's program. 60| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRAD UATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 Written Comprehensive Examinations Each master 's degree student must pass a written comprehensive examination or otherwise show competency in the discipline by successfully completing a specified equivalent that has been approved by the Graduate Council (thesis or project in lieu of comprehensive examinations). Defense of a project or thesis in lieu of comprehensive examinations is equivalent to administering the comprehensive examination. School/department faculty are res ponsible for determining the student 's eligibility for taking the examination as well as scheduling the time, date, and place of the examination. This examination or its approved equivalent may not be taken until the student has: been granted regular adm ission to the program completed school/department -specified course requirements maintained a GPA of at least 3.0 in their program received approval from the program advisor. Application The student will apply in the academic school/department office for the written comprehensive examination or to defend the thesis before the thesis committee. The comprehensive examination permit is valid only for the semester that it is issued. The program advisor must be consulted for information regarding examina tion format, procedures, time, date, and place. Students should not wait until they have been notified of comprehensive examination results before applying for graduation. If the student plans to graduate at the end of the semester in which they take the c omprehensive examination or complete the approved equivalent, the student must apply for graduation within the published deadlines. Once the comprehensive examination session begins, it is considered a take of the examination. If the student leaves the e xamination session and does not return, the examination will be considered taken and the exam will be evaluated accordingly and reported to the Graduate School. Results Once the examination has been evaluated or the project/thesis has been defended, the program advisor must return the signed report form to the Graduate School indicating a pass or failure of the examination. If the student plans to graduate, submitting the comprehensive exam result must be done on or before the published deadline to submit the results of the written comprehensive examination for that semester. Program advisors should provide students with their individual examination results. A retake may not be scheduled during the same semester during which the original examination was completed. Failure of the retake of the examination or its equivalent will result in the termination of the student 's degree program. Results must be reported to the Graduate School within one semester or be retaken. Filing the Thesis All students must follow the program and Graduate School guidelines for writing the master 's thesis, found on our website at www.unco.edu/graduate - school/student -resources/current -students/thesis - capstone -dissertation -resources.aspx. After committee members sign off on the thesis, an electronic copy of the thesis and two (2) original signature pages should be submitted to the Graduate School for an editorial review and dean 's approval at least 4 weeks, (28 calendar days) prior to the request ed graduation date. The Graduate School shall give the student all changes and corrections that must be made before the student turns in the final thesis. The Graduate School will confer the student 's degree once we have received the final version of the t hesis has been approved and the student has uploaded the document to Digital UNC. The Graduate School does not require students to submit hard copies for binding. If you would like to have a copy of the thesis bound, the Graduate School can provide informa tion on vendors who do this work. More detail about the final submission procedures can be found on the Graduate School website www.unco.edu/graduate - school/student -resources/current -students/filing -your- thesis -capstone -dissertation.aspx Plan of Study The program listed in the UNC Graduate Catalog will serve as the plan of study for master 's programs. The Course Adjustment Form, onbase.unco.edu/ GraduateSchool/CourseAdjustment for requesting changes or substitutions to the student 's degree requirements must be signed by the program advisor and submitted to the Graduate School. Students should take the responsibility to make sure any deviations from the Catalog are documented in their Degree Works audit. Research Requirements Students must complete at least one course in research methodology designated as appropriate to the discipline and approved by the Graduate Council. Courses numbered XXX 622 (Directed Studies) shall not be used as a substitute for the re search course. The Graduate School will not waive this requirement but can approve an appropriate substitute research PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS | 61 methodology course. The program advisor must provide a written request to substitute an alternative course, a syllabus for the course, and rationale for the requested substitute to the Graduate Dean in the form of a \"Graduate Student Petition for Exception \". If the student earned a graduate degree from an accredited institution within the last five years in which an equivalent research cours e was taken, the program advisor must provide a written request to waive the UNC research requirement based on the previous course work completed. Graduation Application It is recommended that all master 's students apply for graduation www.unco.edu/grad/forms/pdfs/MastersAndSp ecialistGraduationApplication.pdf no later than the end of the semester preceding the semester during which a student plans to graduate. The schedule of deadlines for the Graduate School can be found at w ww.unco.edu/graduate - school/student -resources/preparing -for-graduation/ graduation -deadlines.aspx. The student has the responsibility for determining that the application has been filed with the Graduate School. The Graduate School will not process a gradu ation application that is not signed by the student and program advisor. If the student does not complete all requirements for the degree and, therefore, does not graduate at the end of the proposed semester, the application will be placed in the deferred file. The student must give written notice to the Graduate School when they wish to appear again on the tentative list of graduates. All graduating students are encouraged to attend graduation. Those students participating in the graduation ceremony are re quired to wear appropriate academic regalia. Diplomas are not issued at the graduation ceremony. All Graduate students must complete a Diploma Request Card at unco.co1.qualtrics.com/ jfe/form/SV_eFKGypwCVx5gmji. The diploma will be mailed to the address pr ovided by the student on the Diploma Request Card . Failure to provide a current mailing address could result in a delay in receipt of the diploma. No diploma will be issued until all requirements for graduation have been met. Time Limit The maximum time allowed for the completion of the master 's degree is five calendar years beginning with the first semester of enrollment after admission has been granted. However, program time limits are adjusted to reflect approval of transfer credit or unclassified hours. Student must complete the degree within five calendar years beginning with the earliest work counted in the program (which would include transfer credit and unclassified hours). Specialist Degree Requirements Courses and Credit Hours A student entering a specialist degree program who possesses a master 's degree must earn a minimum of 30 semester hours of graduate credit beyond the master 's degree. A student entering a specialist degree program who possesses only a baccalaureate degree must earn a minimum of 60 semester hours of graduate credit beyond the baccalaureate degree. Programs may have requirements that exceed the minimum standards established by the university. Plan of Study In conjunction with the supervising committee, each specialist degree student must prepare a plan of study that clearly specifies core requirements and identifies elective, transfer, and double numbered cours e work. The plan must be formalized on a Plan of Study form created by the program faculty. The completed form, including the signature of the program advisor, must be filed with the Graduate School by the end of the student 's first semester of enrollmen t after admission. Upon receipt of a properly signed Plan of Study , the Dean of the Graduate School or their designee shall review and approve or disapprove the plan. If approved, the Plan of Study form will be filed in the student 's Degree Works audit. If disapproved, the Plan of Study form will be returned to the student for correction and re -submission. Because the plan of study will be the basis for the graduation check, any deviation from the plan of study must be approved by the program advisor and th e Dean of the Graduate School or their designee. Written requests: A Course Adjustment Form, for changes or substitutions to the student 's plan of study must be signed by the program advisor and submitted to the Graduate School. Students should take the re sponsibility to make sure any deviations from the Catalog are documented on their Degree Works audit. Transfer Credit Specialist Degree Policy. Students must complete a minimum of 24 credits through the University of Northern Colora do as part of their post -master 's specialist degree. Thus, students can transfer up to six (6) credits from another accredited institution that offers graduate degrees, into a 30 -credit hour specialist degree program. If the program requirements exceed the minimum 30 credits, students are allowed to transfer additional credits as determined by the school/department faculty. Students without a master 's degree must complete 48 semester credit hours at UNC of the 60 required credits for a 62| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRAD UATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 specialist degree. St udents are encouraged to check school policies regarding transfer of credit. These policies allow programs that exceed the 30 credit minimum for a specialist to establish school transfer limits and guidelines that exceed minimum requirements. As long as th e minimum number of credits through UNC are observed, transfer credit allowances to students will be determined by program faculty and can vary on a case by case basis. The Graduate School will not approve students for graduation with fewer than the requir ed UNC credits. Research Requirements Specialist research policy Students must complete at least one course in research methodology designated as appropriate to the discipline and approved by the Graduate Council. Courses numb ered XXX 622 (Directed Studies) shall not be used as a substitute for the research course. The Graduate School will not waive this requirement but can approve an appropriate substitute research methodology course. The program advisor must provide a written request to substitute an alternative course, a syllabus for the course, and rationale for the requested substitute to the Graduate Dean in the form of a \"Graduate Student Petition for Exception \". If the student earned a graduate degree from an accredited institution within the last five years in which an equivalent research course was taken, the program advisor must provide a written request to waive the UNC research requirement based on the previous course work completed. In such cases, students must repl ace the waived credits with another course. Comprehensive Examinations Each specialist student must pass a written comprehensive examination in the area of specialization and pass any other examination(s) the supervising committee may require. The written comprehensive examination may not be taken until the student has: been granted regular admission to the program filed an approved plan of study compl eted at least 20 semester hours (50 semester hours if baccalaureate only student) of work applicable toward the degree, not including the practicum maintained a GPA of at least 3.0 in their program received approval from the program advisor Supervisin g Committee A two -person specialist supervising committee, recommended by the program, will supervise a student 's specialist degree program. The supervising committee will assist the student in preparing a plan of study, overs ee comprehensive examinations where appropriate, and direct the student 's practicum. Graduation Application It is recommended that all specialist students apply for graduation www.unco.edu/graduate -school/pdf/Masters - and-Spec ialist -Graduation -Application.pdf no later than the end of the semester preceding the semester during which a student plans to graduate. The schedule of deadlines for the Graduate School can be found at www.unco.edu/graduate -school/student -resources/ prepa ring-for-graduation/graduation -deadlines.aspx. The student has the responsibility for determining that the application has been filed with the Graduate School. The Graduate School will not process a graduation application that is not signed by the student and program advisor. If the student does not complete all requirements for the degree and, therefore, does not graduate at the end of the proposed semester, the application will be placed in the deferred file. The student must give written notice to the Graduate School when they wish to appear again on the tentative list of graduates. All graduating students are encouraged to attend graduation. Those students participating in the graduation ceremony are required to wear appropriate academic regalia. Diplo mas are not issued at the graduation ceremony. All Graduate students must complete a Diploma Request Card at unco.co1.qualtrics.com/ jfe/form/SV_eFKGypwCVx5gmji. The diploma will be mailed to the address provided by the student on the Diploma Request Card. Failure to provide a current mailing address could result in a delay in receipt of the diploma. No diploma will be issued until all requirements for graduation have been met. Time Limit The maximum time allowed for completion of the Specialist in Education degree is six calendar years beginning with the first semester of enrollment after admission has been granted. However, program time limits are adjusted to reflect approval of transfer credit or unclassified hours. Student must complet e the degree within six calendar years beginning with the earliest work counted in the program (which would include transfer credit and unclassified hours). Doctoral Degree Requirements Doctoral Minor Doctoral minors consist of a minimum of 15 semester hours of course work in a discipline different from the doctoral program. Any school/department with at least one approved graduate degree program (master 's, specialist, or doctorate) is eligible to offer doctoral minor(s). Proposals PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS | 63 for doctoral minors are submitted through the university curriculum approval process. Upon approval, the doctoral minor will be listed in the university catalog. Graduate students admitted to doctoral programs may, upon a pproval of their doctoral program advisor, select a minor program of study for inclusion in their doctoral program. Completion of the doctoral minor will be indicated on the student 's transcript. Doctoral students who have been approved by the school/depar tment to pursue a doctoral minor will include the requirements for completion of the minor in their doctoral plan of study. The credit hours associated with an approved doctoral minor count toward the total doctoral degree program hours required only when they overlap with electives or research core requirements. No course is allowed to count for double credit hours. Student is not allowed to pursue a minor offered under the same program name as the doctoral program to which they are admitted. To complete a minor, the student must first be officially admitted to a doctoral degree program. Second Doctorate Guidelines Double majors are not permitted at the doctoral level. A student may receive a second doctoral degree from U NC provided that the requirements for the first doctoral degree have been completed before initiating the second degree program and provided that no course work from the first degree is counted toward the second degree. Courses and Credit Hours Credit Hours A student entering a doctoral program who possesses a master 's degree must earn a minimum of 64 semester hours of graduate credit beyond the master 's degree. This includes a minimum of 48 semester hou rs of graduate level discipline content courses and 16 semester hours of research credit. A student who possesses only a baccalaureate degree must earn a minimum of 94 semester hours of graduate credit beyond the baccalaureate degree. This includes a minim um of 78 semester hours of graduate level discipline content courses and 16 semester hours of research credit. A student who possesses a master 's degree but who is attempting to obtain a second master 's degree enroute to a doctoral degree must meet the sam e credit hour requirements as the baccalaureate only student. A student who possesses a specialist degree may count a maximum of 21 semester hours of specialist work in the doctoral program with the approval of the Graduate School and program advisor. Schools may have requirements that exceed the minimums established by the University. Transfer Credit Doctoral students must complete a minimum of 40 semester hours through UNC of the 64 minimum required for a doctoral degr ee. If the program requirements exceed the 64 credit minimum, students are allowed to transfer additional credits, as determined by their advisor, from another accredited institution that grants doctoral degrees. Doctoral students without a master 's degree must complete 64 of the 94 required credits at UNC for a doctoral degree. The plan of study will indicate transfer credits to be included in a student 's program. Students are encouraged to check school or department policies regarding transfer of credit. These policies allow programs that exceed the 64 credit minimum for a doctoral degree to establish school transfer limits and guidelines that exceed minimums. As long as the minimum number of credits through UNC are observed, transfer credit allowances to students will be determined by program faculty and can vary on a case by case basis. The Graduate School will not approve students for graduation with fewer than the required UNC credits. Doctoral Committee Each doctoral student must have a Research Advisor and a doctoral committee appointed before the written comprehensive exam is taken. At minimum, a doctoral committee must consist of: 1. a Research Advisor, who must be from within the program/discipline area and must hold a cur rent Doctoral Research Endorsement [DRE] status. Faculty wishing to continue to serve as Research Advisor after retirement must hold a current Emeritus Graduate Faculty status with DRE (EGF/DRE). 2. one additional faculty Committee Member from within the p rogram/discipline area; 3. one additional faculty Committee Member from within a related discipline or area of inquiry; 4. a Faculty Representative (needs to be outside the program discipline). Doctoral scholarly project committees require a minimum of thr ee committee members to include a research advisor, an additional committee member from the program or related discipline and a Faculty Representative from outside the program. All Committee Members and Faculty Representative must hold a current Graduate F aculty (GF) status. The doctoral committee is subject to the approval of the program advisor and the Graduate School. The student and all members of the Doctoral Committee will receive confirmation of the approved committee assignments. Unless the student or Research Advisor 64| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRAD UATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 informs the Graduate School or the Graduate School informs the student of the need for a change, the doctoral committee membership will remain the same from the written comprehensive examination throughout the dissertation or doctoral s cholarly project research stages of the program. The Graduate School reviews and confirms the membership of student 's doctoral committee each time a Request to Schedule the Doctoral Examination (oral comps and dissertation or doctoral scholarly project defense) is submitted and upon submission of the student 's dissertation proposal. The Graduate Dean charges the Faculty Representative with upholding the standards and expectations of the Graduate Faculty. The faculty representative is a full voting member with all the rights and responsibilities of any other member and must be present at the student 's oral examination, proposal hearing, and final doctoral scholarly project or dissertation defense. The faculty representative must hold Graduate Faculty status. The faculty representative is expected to actively contribute conceptual, theoretical, methodological and/or academic expertise from an alternative disciplinary perspective and provide an impar tial evaluation of the student 's academic work. No faculty member will be appointed to a doctoral committee without their consent. University faculty who have not been appointed Graduate Faculty, Clinical Graduate Faculty, Doctoral Research or Retired Grad uate Faculty status by the Graduate Council shall not be appointed as members of doctoral committees. An Honorary member is not required, but is allowed when an off campus faculty member with research expertise related to the study is requested. An Honorar y committee member must apply for and receive Graduate Faculty Equivalence status. The Honorary committee member is a full voting member with all the rights and responsibilities of other members of the committee and must be present at the student 's doctora l oral examination, dissertation proposal and dissertation defense. Any change of membership or role (faculty rep, co - research advisor, committee member) requires a change of committee membership form to the Graduate School www.unco.edu/graduate -school/pdf /Change - Committee.pdf. Changes to the membership of a doctoral committee should be rare and made only after the student and the research advisor have consulted. Students who wish to replace a committee member are urged to communicate the desire and rationa le for the change directly to the specific faculty member in person. If a committee member or faculty representative is unable to be present during an oral examination, proposal hearing or dissertation or doctoral scholarly project defense, the program are a shall appoint an eligible member of the graduate faculty to replace the original committee member on the student 's doctoral committee. The Graduate School must be notified of the replacement before the oral exam, proposal hearing or final defense. If a r eplacement cannot be appointed prior to the examination, proposal or defense, the exam must be rescheduled for a future date. The concerns and recommendations of all committee members, including the faculty representative, are crucial to the dissertation a pproval process. Faculty Committee Load Policy An individual graduate faculty member may serve on ten active doctoral research committees at any one time and may serve as the research or co -research advisor on no more than five of these ten committees. Exceptions to the committee maximums may be permitted only if agreed to by the graduate faculty member, school director or department chair and college dean as follows: The faculty member involved agrees that their load (current or projected) allows adequate time to take on an additional student without adversely affecting the responsibility of the school/department to other students and to programs offered by the school/department. The school director or department c hair approves the additional student. Approval indicates that the director has reviewed the current load of the faculty member and does not feel the additional load will adversely affect the responsibility of the school/department to other students and to programs offered by the school/department. The Graduate Dean has approved the exception(s). An individual school/department may elect to impose more stringent limitations on its faculty with respect to the number of committees on which they may serve. \"Active doctoral student \" is defined as one who is currently enrolled. Plan of Study Student 's program advisor, appointed and approved by the major school/department, shall supervise the planning of a student 's doctoral degree program . In conjunction with the appointed advisor, each doctoral student must prepare a long-range plan of study that clearly specifies core requirements, elective, transfer, double -numbered coursework, and if applicable, research tools and doctoral minor. The p lan must be formalized, including signatures of the advisor or the appointed faculty (if required by the school/department). For a suggested Plan of Study format see www.unco.edu/graduate -school/pdf/Plan -of-Study.pdf. The Plan of Study must be filed with t he Graduate School by the end of the student 's first semester of enrollment after admission. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS | 65 Upon receipt of a properly signed Plan of Study form, the Dean of the Graduate School or their designee shall review the plan and approve or disapprove the plan. I f approved, the Plan of Study form will be included on the student 's Degree Works audit. If approved, the Plan of Study will be the basis for the graduation check. Any deviation from the plan of Study must be approved by the program advisor and the Dean of the Graduate School or their designee. Changes to the Plan of Study must be approved by the advisor and submitted in writing to the Graduate School on the course adjustment form found at www.unco.edu/ graduate -school/student -resources/current -students/ graduate -school -forms.aspx. Students should take the responsibility to make sure any deviations from the Plan of Study are documented on their Degree Works audit. Comprehensive Examinations: Written All examinations and the defense of the dissertation must be scheduled with the approval of all committee members. They may not be performed on weekends or when the University offices are closed for holidays. The Grad uate School discourages the scheduling of written comprehensive exams prior to the start of classes each term. Each doctoral student must pass a written comprehensive examination that is designed, administered, and evaluated by the graduate faculty of the major school/department and by other qualified individuals as specified by the research advisor. A student must maintain enrollment in the program and have active status at the time of the examination. A student on an approved Leave of Absence is not permi tted to complete a comprehensive exam during the LOA period. This examination may not be taken until the student has: been granted regular admission to the degree program; filed an approved plan of study; completed at least 36 semester hours (60 sem ester hours if baccalaureate only student) of work applicable toward the degree -- at least 24 semester hours must be UNC credit; maintained active status in the program; maintained a grade point average of at least 3.00 in their graduate degree progra m; a doctoral committee appointed by the Graduate School; obtained approval from the research advisor to take the exam. The major school/department is responsible for scheduling the date, time, and place of the written comprehensive examination(s). Each student must check the school/ department requirements at the beginning of their program of study. Written comprehensive ex aminations may not be performed on weekends or when University offices are closed for the holidays. For comprehensive examinations that are timed, once an exam session begins, it is considered a take of the examination. If the student leaves the examinatio n session and does not return or does not complete the exam during the allotted time frame, the examination will be considered taken and the exam will be evaluated accordingly. For take-home examinations that are not strictly timed, the school/department s hould determine a starting time/date and ending time/date during which the student must complete the exam. Once the examination has been evaluated, the program advisor must submit a signed report form to the Graduate School indicating a pass or failure of the examination by the deadline established for that semester by the Graduate School. The results of the written comprehensive examinations must be reported to the Graduate School no later than the semester following the examination or the Graduate School may require a repeat of the examination. Results of the written comprehensive examinations will not be recorded if the student 's program is inactive because of non - enrollment or if the student is currently on an approved Leave of Absence. A retake may not be scheduled during the same semester that the original examination was completed. Failure of the retake of the examination or its equivalent will result in the termination of the student 's degree program. Electronic Attendance Policy Doctoral students ' oral comprehensive, proposal and final dissertation/doctoral scholarly project defense examinations require the attendance of the student, all committee members, including the faculty representative, external and honorary members. Attendance, for the purpose of this policy, is defined as either a physical/in - person presence on campus or an electronic presence ( e.g., telephone/conference call, video conferencing [Skype \u00ae, Facetime\u00ae] or other online meeting platform. Elect ronic attendance by the student or committee members assume the technology is viable and works continuously throughout the examination of the student. Should the technology fail or be disrupted in any committee meeting (orals, proposal, or final disserta tion/doctoral scholarly project defense) in excess of 15 minutes the Research Advisor and/or Faculty Rep must contact the Graduate School and reschedule the examination for a later date. In such cases, the student will not be subject to the two -week period required for public announcement of the examination. If the examination continues with failed technology for more than 15 minutes, the results will 66| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRAD UATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 not be accepted by the Graduate School and the student will need to reschedule and will be subject to the t wo- week period for public announcement. No more than two persons, either two committee members or the student and committee member may attend dissertation proposal or doctoral scholarly project defense electronically. No more than two committee members may attend the oral comprehensive or dissertation/doctoral scholarly project defense electronically. Online and In -country programs With the consent of their program, doctoral students, in programs delivered online or in country, are permitted to attend their oral comprehensive examination and dissertation/doctoral scholarly project proposal hearing electronically provided the doctoral research committee has, in advance of the hearing, received all necessary and relevant documents, visuals and or materials. Doctoral students, in online programs must attend the final dissertation defense, in person, on the main campus to allow attendance by members of the academic community. Doctoral students whose programs are deliver ed in country will defend their dissertation/doctoral scholarly project at a location determined by the doctoral program and Dean of the Graduate School. Main campus programs: Consistent with the delivery method of their programs doctoral students enrolled in main campus programs must attend their oral comprehensives, proposal hearing and final dissertation/doctoral scholarly project defense, in person, on the main campus. In rare cases, doctoral students, with the support of their research advisor, may pet ition the Graduate School to be exempted from this policy to be permitted to attend either the oral comprehensive examination or the proposal hearing electronically. Doctoral students enrolled in main campus programs must attend their final dissertation de fense in person, no exceptions. Research Advisor/Co -Research Advisor for a student in online or main campus doctoral programs is expected to attend an advisee 's oral comprehensives, proposal hearing and final dissertation/doctoral scholarly project defense , in person, on the main campus. The Graduate School (or designee) will consider a petition for exemption from this policy in limited circumstances (e.g., the Research Advisor is out of town on sabbatical leave). If the Research Advisor/Co -Research Advisor cannot be present in person on the main campus for an advisee 's examination or defense, the Graduate School will, in most cases, require the examination or defense to be rescheduled. Committee Members All members of doctoral rese arch committees (research and co -research advisors, program representatives, members from related disciplines, and external and honorary members) must be present at doctoral students ' oral comprehensive examinations, dissertation proposal defense and final dissertation/doctoral scholarly project defense. No more than two of the four committee members may, attend the oral comprehensive examination and proposal defense via electronic means. Committee members must plan ahead and discuss the desire to attend electronically with the doctoral student and the student 's Research Advisor. The Research Advisor and doctoral student work together in advance of the examination or defense to secure the needed technology and space (room, conferencing number, etc.). The stu dent will indicate and the Research Advisor will confirm committee members ' electronic attendance on The Request to Schedule a Doctoral Examination form submitted to the Graduate School in advance of the examination. In the event of unforeseen circumstance or a weather related emergency, two of the four committee members may attend oral comprehensive examinations or proposal hearings electronically. Comprehensive Examinations: Oral After passing the written comprehensive examination, doctoral students must take and pass an oral comprehensive examination. The research advisor serves as chairperson of the oral comprehensive examination committe e and directs the student to arrange the date, time and place of the oral examination with all committee members . After all arrangements are made, the student or program advisor will notify the Graduate School by forwarding a signed and completed Request to Schedule a Doctoral Examination form at least two weeks prior to the date of the examination. In order for the Graduate School to approve a request for the student to take the examination, the following conditions must be met: The committee members an d faculty representative must be the same as those approved by the Graduate School. The written comprehensive examination results must have been received and recorded by the Graduate School prior to requesting to schedule the oral comprehensive examinati on. A student must be in compliance with the continuous enrollment policy. The student 's program must be active. The student must not be on an approved Leave of Absence. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS | 67 Annual progress review from program on file in the Graduate School for each ye ar prior to students scheduling their oral exam. The Request to Schedule a Doctoral Examination must be turned in to the Graduate School at least two weeks (14 calendar days) before the requested date of the examination to allow the Graduate School to pu blicize the examination. Exceptions to this rule must be accompanied by an explanation of the late request from the Research Advisor and will be considered on a case by case basis. No exam/defense will be allowed with less than one week prior notice. The student is responsible for confirming the date and time of the examination with all of their committee members. The Graduate School will approve and publicize the examination date, time and place in UNC Today, the Graduate School calendar or in any other a ppropriate university publication and forward a Results of the Oral Comprehensive Exam form to the student 's Research Advisor. Any examination which is not scheduled in advance through the Graduate School will not be recognized as valid and must be resched uled. All committee members and the faculty representative must be present at the examination or a substitute assigned according to the guidelines for Doctoral Committees. The student 's performances on the examination will be evaluated as: 1. pass; 2. may pass when conditions are met (specific conditions and a timeline for completion must be recorded on the Results of the Oral Comprehensive Examination form before turning in to the Graduate School); or, 3. fail, with the option of \"retake permitted \" or \"retake not permitted \" which should be specified on the Results of the Oral Comprehensive Examination form before submitting it to the Graduate School. A decision not to permit a retake will result in the student 's termination from the degree program. If the s tudent does not pass during the first attempt of the oral comprehensive examination, and a retake is permitted by the committee, the retake may not be scheduled during the same semester that the original examination was completed. Only one retake is allowe d. Failure of the examination retake will result in termination of the student 's degree program. At least three -fourths of the committee members must agree on the final evaluation. All members of the UNC faculty are invited to attend and may ask questions of the student after the committee members finish their questioning. Other graduate students may also attend with permission from student 's research advisor. The results of the oral comprehensive examinations must be reported to the Graduate School no lat er than the semester following the examination or defense or the Graduate School may require a repeat of the examination. Progress Review Schools/departments are to evaluate and provide an annual program progress report for each doc toral student until the student passes the oral comprehensive examination. Doctoral student advisors will be responsible for obtaining the following information for each assigned advisee: Student 's self -evaluations of their academic performance and profe ssional development, Student 's grades in all graduate courses during the evaluation period, Performance ratings from instructors for all graduate courses during the evaluation period, Assessment of the student 's professional development from appropr iate school/department faculty. Based on the data collected, each doctoral advisor will meet with each student 's doctoral committee to develop and provide a summary of the student 's strengths and area(s) for improvement. Emphasis should be placed on acknow ledging accomplishments and professional growth where appropriate. Recommendations for improvement should include specific changes expected in the student 's performance or behavior, means of assessing the changes, and the time period by which the change is expected to occur. Improvements or lack of change in areas recommended from prior progress reports should be documented. Signatures of the advisor is required on the progress report. The progress report will include a clear recommen dation to the school director/department chair of the Graduate Program Committee (GPC) of whether the student is to be continued each year without conditions, continued with conditions, or not supported for continuation. If conditions for improvement are s tipulated, the student must be informed by the Graduate Program Committee (GPC), in writing, of the conditions and specific changes required to satisfy the conditions. If the school/department does not have a GPC, the report will be submitted directly to t he school director or department chair. The following procedures must be followed prior to submitting a recommendation to discontinue a doctoral student 's program for causes other than poor academic performance: The student must be informed of the pattern of behavior or incident(s) that has given rise to concern among the school/department faculty members and that led to the recommendation for program discontinuation. These concerns should be noted in the student 's annual progress review. 68| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRAD UATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 The stud ent must be given an opportunity to meet with and address the observed behavior or incident with the school/departments Graduate Program Committee (GPC) or with the student 's doctoral committee for school/departments with no graduate program committee. Fol lowing the meeting, the GPC or doctoral committee must either reassert the concerns or withdraw the concerns in writing to the department chair or school director. If the complaint arises from an unprofessional behavior or other behavioral concerns, the st udent will be given a clearly defined probationary period during which clear behavioral objectives are provided to either rectify the concerns or change the behavior. Clear means of assessing improvement will be provided. If the complaint results from an e gregious violation of laws or published university or school/department policy, rules or professional ethics, clear documented evidence of the incident(s) must be provided with the recommendation. Copies of the progress report are to be provided by the GPC or student doctoral committee to the school director or department chair no later than April 15 of each year and copied to the student. A department chair or school director may agree or disagree with the GPC 's or doctoral committee recommendation. If in agreement with the recommendation, the director or chair will approve and submit the progress report to the Dean of the Graduate School and a copy to the college dean by May 1. The student and GPC or doctoral committee will be informed in writing of the ap proval. If in disagreement with the GPC 's or doctoral committee 's recommendation, the school director or department chair will invite the student 's program advisor and the GPC chair or doctoral committee members to discuss the disagreement. After the meeti ng, the GPC chair or student 's doctoral advisor will approve and submit the original progress report recommendation to the Graduate Dean with a copy to the college dean and student. or Modify and submit the recommendation to include conditions agreed to by the school director/department chair and GPC or doctoral committee (or add conditions) to the Graduate Dean with a copy to the college dean and student. or Change and submit the recommendation as agreed to by the department chair/school director and GPC o r doctoral committee with explanation any additional documentation and signed acknowledgement from the department chair/school director and GPC chair or doctoral committee members. The advisor and GPC members or doctoral committee members may submit additi onal comments or documentation to support the GPC chair 's decision or to express opposition to the chair 's decision. The changed recommendation will then be submitted to the Dean of the Graduate School with a copy to the college dean and student. Doctoral Dissertation A dissertation or doctoral scholarly project proposal and final dissertation or doctoral scholarly project should be developed pertaining to a significant topic in the candidate 's major. A dissertation or doctoral scholarly project is required of all doctoral students. For students in programs requiring a dissertation (i.e., D.A., Ed.D., Ph.D .) minimum credit for the dissertation proposal (797) is 4 semester hours, and for the final dissertation (799) is 12 semeste r hours. No more than 4 hours of proposal (797) and 12 hours of dissertation (799) semester hours may be applied to the minimum credit requirements of a student 's program. Students in programs requiring a doctoral scholarly project (i.e., Au.D. or D.N.P.) are not required to register for 797 or 799. Dissertation Proposal The dissertation proposal be presented to the student 's doctoral committee for approval prior to engaging in final data collection. In addition, the approved dissertation proposal must be filed electronically with the Graduate School. Students must have an approved IRB application or an approved IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) application if using human participants or animal subjects, respectively, prior to data collect ion. Although all 797 and 799 credits will be graded with an S or U in the semesters for which students registered for the credits, final approval of the dissertation by the Graduate School is required for a student to graduate. Students pursuing the Au.D . or D.N.P are not required to file their approved doctoral scholarly project proposals with the Graduate School. The dissertation proposal is crucial in the dissertation process and should culminate with a formal dissertation proposal hearing. The proposa l shall be presented to the student 's entire committee in a timely manner as specified by the committee (typically at least two weeks prior to the proposal hearing). Students coordinate with their research advisor and doctoral committee to schedule the dat e, time and location of the proposal hearing which is not scheduled with the Graduate School. The full committee, including the faculty representative (for dissertation committees), must be present at the proposal hearing. After the proposal hearing, it wi ll be the student 's responsibility, in consultation with the research advisor, to address those concerns in a revised proposal. It is recommended that the student summarize the changes that have been incorporated into the revised proposal to assist the com mittee in identifying and locating the changes. The revised proposal should then be circulated with a signature page to the committee for review and signature if PROGRAM REQUIREMEN TS| 69 they approve of the revisions. A second committee meeting is optional but could be required by the committee due to the extensive nature of the expected changes or to expedite the approval process. All committee members ' signatures are required. Approval of the dissertation proposal establishes the expectations for the final dissertation and assure s agreement among the committee with the student 's methods and research strategy prior to proceeding to the final stages of the dissertation or capstone (including securing IRB or IACUC approval prior to data collection). The proposal hearing also allows t he committee to introduce required changes or additions to a student 's proposed project while changes are still possible. Scheduling the proposal hearing is done with the program office according to the major school or departmental policies. Filing Dissert ation Proposal In order for the Graduate School to record a student 's successful proposal defense, the student shall submit an electronic copy of the approved proposal, signed signature page IRB or IACUC approval (if applicable) and signed Verification of Research Subject or Participant Compliance form www.unco.edu/graduate -school/ pdf/verification -research -subject -compliance.pdf shall be submitted to the Graduate School. The student will not be entered into candidacy until the proposal and required accompanying documents are submitted. Students are also responsible for maintaining their own copy of the entire proposal in a secure location until the time of their graduation. Doctoral Candidacy Doctoral students advance to candidacy upon pass ing the written and oral comprehensive examinations and filing an approved dissertation proposal and submitting all the required paperwork for the dissertation proposal to the Graduate School. Because the term Doctoral Candidate has a specific institutiona l connotation, doctoral students may not use the term 'Doctoral Candidate ' until this status is documented by the Graduate School. The Graduate School will consider the dissertation proposal as accepted unless the Graduate School Dean objects to the propos al. If the Dean objects, the proposal will be sent to the student and research advisor with specific written request for revisions. If a doctoral committee reports to the Graduate School that a student has failed the dissertation proposal, the committee mu st also send a recommendation for the Graduate School to terminate the student 's program. The Graduate School will expect the doctoral committee to create a document with justification for the program termination that can be shared with the student. Disser tation and Doctoral Defense The student will complete the research and write the dissertation or doctoral scholarly project in close collaboration with their research advisor(s). All students must follow the school /department style guide as well as the Graduate School guidelines for writing the doctoral dissertation or doctoral scholarly project. The Graduate School Doctoral Dissertation and Doctoral Scholarly Project Format Manual can be found on the Graduate Schoo l website. Student should discuss discipline specific formatting rules with their doctoral committee advisor. Upon completion of the dissertation or project, the research advisor should direct the student to arrange the date, time and place of the defens e of the dissertation or doctoral scholarly project with all committee members . After all arrangements are made, the student or research advisor will notify the Graduate School by forwarding a signed and completed Request to Schedule a Doctoral Examination form found at www.unco.edu/graduate -school/pdf/Request - Schedule -Doctoral -Exam.pdf In order for the Graduate School to approve a request for the student to defend the dissertation or doctoral scholarly project, the following conditions must be met: The committee members and faculty representative (for dissertation committees) must be the same as those approved by the Graduate School. The student 's plan of study, written and oral comprehensive examination results must have been received and recorded by the Graduate School. The student must have been admitted into candidacy at least one semester prior to requesting to defend the dissertation. The Request to Schedule a Doctoral examination must be turned in to the Graduate School at least two weeks (14 calendar days) before the requested date of the defense to allow for the dissertation or doctoral scholarly project defense to be publicized. The defense may not be schedule for weekends or when University offices are closed for holidays as the defens e is considered a public hearing. The defense of the dissertation or doctoral scholarly project must be scheduled at least five weeks (35 calendar days) prior to the anticipated graduation date. If it is not, the student may not graduate until the follow ing semester. The student is responsible for confirming the date and time of the examination with all of the committee members. The Graduate School will approve and publicize the examination date, time and place in the UNC Today or in any other appropriate university publication two weeks prior to the scheduled date. The Graduate School forwards 70| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRAD UATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 a results form to the student 's Research Advisor as approval of the defense. Any examination which is not scheduled in advance through the Graduate School will not be recognized as valid and must be retaken. Prior to the defense date, the research advisor should discuss the nature and purpose of the dissertation or doctoral scholarly project defense with the student. Generally, the student is instructed to prepare a brief presentation of the study from the purpose to the results and discussion. All committee members including the faculty representative must be present through the entire defense or a substitute assigned according to the guidelines for Doctoral Committe e. All members of the graduate faculty may attend the defense and may ask questions of the student after the committee members finish their questioning. Other graduate students may attend with permission from the research advisor. The committee is free to ask any questions pertaining to the dissertation or capstone. The student is expected to understand and demonstrate expertise on all aspects of the study including the data analyses and theoretical or practical implications and should avoid being unaware o f the procedure or logic followed in the data analyses. It is recommended that the student bring at least 2 copies of the signature pages for the dissertation or capstone to the defense in the event that the committee evaluates the performance as a pass so that committee members can then sign the results form and the signature pages. The dissertation committee will evaluate the student 's performance at the defense as well as the written dissertation or doctoral scholarly project as a \"pass\", \"may pass with conditions \", or \"failed \" on the results of the dissertation defense form. Pass: If the student passes the defense, the research advisor shall obtain the signatures of the research committee members on the results form (which the research advisor will bri ng to the defense), and submit the form to the Graduate School. The student shall proceed to make any corrections to the dissertation or doctoral scholarly project that are required by the research committee and submit the corrected dissertation or doctora l scholarly project to the committee members (if required) for their review and signatures. The student must provide 2 necessary copies of the signature page for Graduate School records. Original signatures are required on every signature page. May Pass: If the research committee requires the student to meet stated conditions, the research advisor shall list the conditions on the results form along with a timeline for completion, obtain the signatures of the committee members on the results form, and subm it the form to the Graduate School. The list of conditions must include a statement regarding the number of additional defense meetings (if applicable) and the amount of additional time allowed by the research committee. The student shall proceed to make a ny corrections required by the research committee and submit the corrected dissertation or doctoral scholarly project to the committee members for their signatures. The results form shall be retained by the Graduate School until either conditions are met, or the committee deems the student has not met the conditions. After the student submits the corrected dissertation or doctoral scholarly project to the committee, or otherwise attempts to meet the required conditions, the research advisor shall obtain the original results form from the Graduate School. If the student does not meet the stated conditions, the Graduate School shall then notify the student that the degree program is terminated. Failed: If a student fails the defense, the research advisor shall obtain the signatures of the research committee members on the results form and submit the form to the Graduate School. The Graduate School shall then notify the student that the student 's degree program is terminated. The committee must reach a unanimous decision on the final evaluation of the candidate 's dissertation defense. If the committee cannot reach consensus, then committee members may initiate the Dissertation Objection process The res ults of dissertation and doctoral scholarly project defenses must be reported to the Graduate School no later than the semester following the defense or the Graduate School may require the student to repeat the defense. Dissertation and Doctoral Scholarly Project Filing After completing any necessary revisions and obtaining approval of the dissertation or doctoral scholarly project by the student 's research committee, students must submit the following to the Graduate School for an editorial review and fina l approval by the Dean of the Graduate School. an electronic copy of the final dissertation in either MS Word of pdf Verification of Research Subject or Participant Compliance form www.unco.edu/graduate -school/ student -resources/current -students/gradua te-school - forms.aspx the IRB or IACUC approval (if applicable) and at least two (2) original signed signatures pages The student will then be asked to make revisions and/or submit the required copies of the final dissertation or doctoral scholarly projec t to the Dean of the Graduate School for signature. The dissertation or doctoral scholarly project is not approved until signed by the Dean of the Graduate School. Dissertations will receive two formatting reviews. Students who do not have the dissertation or PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS | 71 doctoral scholarly project in the correct format by the third submission to the Graduate School will be moved to the next semester for graduation. If the dissertation or doctoral scholarly project is not filed with the Graduate School at least four wee ks (28 calendar days) before the student 's anticipated graduation date, the student may not graduate until the following semester. Upon filing the dissertation or doctoral scholarly project, the Graduate School will require each doctoral student to complet e specific forms relating to the dissertation or doctoral scholarly project and will bill the students ' UNC account for digital archiving and dissemination of the dissertation or doctoral scholarly project. Final submission procedures and necessary forms c an be found on the Graduate School website (www.unco.edu/graduate - school/student -resources/current -students/graduate -school - forms.aspx). The dissertation or doctoral scholarly project will be electronically stored and the dissertation abstract will be publ ished in ProQuest Information and Learning (formally Dissertation Abstracts) and in the University Library 's Digital UNC. The Graduate School follows an electronic only process for dissertations and doctoral scholarly projects; therefore, students are not required to submit hard copies for binding. Dissertation Objection If a dissertation is filed with all but one of the signatures of the research committee members, the Dean of the Graduate School or their designee will ask the non -signing member if they wi sh to enter a formal objection(s). Should the committee member file an objection, the Dean of the Graduate School will appoint a review committee to assess the specific objection(s). If the review committee rules that the objection(s) does/do not justify t he rejection of the study, the chairperson of the review committee will sign the dissertation in place of the dissenting faculty member. If the review committee rules that the objection(s) is/are valid, the student must take appropriate steps to modify the dissertation in order to gain the approval of the original dissertation committee. Research Requirements Research Core Doctoral students must complete a research core of at least 12 semester hours of research courses or metho ds of inquiry designated as appropriate to the discipline and approved by the Graduate Council. Courses numbered XXX 622 (Directed Studies) shall not be used to substitute for courses in the research core. The Graduate School will not waive this requiremen t but can approve appropriate substitute research courses or methods up to the full 12 semester hours. The program advisor must provide a written request to substitute an alternative course, a syllabus for each course, and rationale for the requested subst itute(s) to the Graduate Dean. Research Tools All Ph.D. students must demonstrate competency in two acceptable research tools. A research tool is defined as exhibiting advanced knowledge and/or demonstrating a set of skills related to a specifiable technique or method that contributes to the student 's ability to conduct doctoral level research in the discipline. Schools/departments will determine acceptable research tools such as languages, applied statistics, mathematical statistics, res earch methods, and computer languages/applications. Collateral Field With the approval of the major school/department and the Dean of the Graduate School doctoral students may use a collateral field of study as a substitute for one of the research tools. A collateral field of at least 12 credit hours is defined as advanced and specialized or focused knowledge and competence within a specifiable content area or skill area from a related discipline that contributes to the student 's ability to conduct doctoral level research in their major discipline (e.g., advanced cognitive theory, applications of distance education technology or multimedia technology to the classroom). The level of competency and the assessment of competency is established by each school/dep artment and must be approved by the Dean of the Graduate School. Means of evaluating the student 's knowledge or skill must be included on the plan of study to indicate how each research tool requirement is to be satisfied. Acceptable evaluation of research tools might include examinations in academic courses, competency demonstrations evaluated by advisors and committee members, or alternative testing or competency demonstration procedures developed within the school/department. Graduation Check Upon a student 's admission to doctoral candidacy, the Graduate School will conduct a preliminary graduation check. Any discrepancies between the transcript and the plan of study must be corrected with either a new plan of study or a course ad justment form initiated by the advisor. Upon receipt of the preliminary graduation check, the student must thereafter notify the Graduate School by completing an Application for Graduation at unco.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6SG6Bm3mpFbqstv. All graduati ng students are encouraged to attend graduation. Those students participating in the graduation ceremony are required to wear appropriate academic regalia.

Final Project All students are responsible for completing two pieces of original historical writing of the length and quality of journal articles. Students will write the essays under the guidance of history faculty while taking two semesters of HIST 690 (one essay completed in each class). Combined, the two essays serve as the final project for the M.A. degree. Students must earn at least a B (B - is not acceptabl e) on the papers themselves, regardless of the grade earned for the course overall. Students who do not earn a B on either of their papers must take HIST 690 a third time; in this case, they may count the previous HIST 690 as an elective. In order to complete the master 's degree, students will also take 21 credits (7 classes) of electives covering any region or period of history.

However, the accelerated B.A./M.A. program involves shared credit hours shared between the Bachelor 's and Master 's programs, so the total number of credit hours to complete the accelerated Master 's program is 141 for students with a Liberal Arts concentration and 148 for those with a Secondary Teaching concentration. Completing the requirements for both degrees is made possible by taking double -counted B.A./M.A. credits during the Senior year (paid for at the undergraduate tuition rate) a nd graduate -level credits (online - graduate -level tuition rate) in the summer following the Senior year and completion of the undergraduate program. While this is the most efficient route, students may also elect to complete the program at a slower pace. Students remain eligible for financial aid as an undergraduate; any Graduate School aid is not available until students are admitted to the Graduate Program. Accelerated M.A. Admission Due to its necessarily streamlined path of progression, admission to th e Accelerated B.A. and M.A. in History occurs in the Fall semester only.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS | 191 Other Graduate Degree Programs INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES: GRADUATE INTERDISCIPLINARY DEGREE The Graduate Interdisciplinary Degree Program (GIDP) is designed to be a rigorous, quality program providing the opportunity to qualified students to meet career goals by combining two or more disciplines into a single degree program. To ensure the qua lity of the program, a faculty member will be assigned from each discipline concerned to provide close supervision, participation, and coordination. It is imperative that the program be truly interdisciplinary and represents an integration of subject matte r from each of the major disciplines. Programs that parallel other degree programs are not acceptable as interdisciplinary degree programs. Identification of two primary disciplines which will be combined in the proposed program. At least one of the primar y disciplines listed must offer a program leading to the desired degree (i.e., MA, MAT, MM, MS, DA or EdD). Secondary disciplines may also be included. Applicants for the GIDP are encouraged to consult with the Graduate School prior to submitting their app lications. Applicants must follow the student administered application procedure. The complete application packet should include the following: Interdisciplinary Admission Application 1. The degree application returned with the appropriate non-refundable application fee. 2. One official copy of the applicant 's transcripts from all colleges or universities attended (except UNC). 3. If applying for a doctoral program, one official copy of the applicant 's GRE General Test scores (not more than five years - 1,825 calendar days old) sent from Educational Testing Service to the Graduate School. A student copy of the GRE results will be accepted in the packet for processing to the program area for screening. NO admission will be granted until the of ficial GRE report is received from Educational Testing Service. 4. Three letters of recommendation from appropriate professional sources attesting to the applicant 's ability to pursue the intended graduate interdisciplinary program. 5. A detailed written s tatement of career goals and objectives and a rational for pursuing the proposed interdisciplinary program. This must be a compelling statement clarifying why no single existing degree program could satisfy these goals. 6. Identification of two primary dis ciplines which will be combined in the proposed program. At least one of the primary disciplines listed must offer a program leading to the desired degree, (i.e. , MA, MAT, MM, MS, DA or EdD). Secondary disciplines may also be included. 7. A current resume that summarized academic and professional experiences, activities, publications, and other pertinent information. Preliminary Review. The Graduate Interdisciplinary Degree Coordinating Committee, comprised of interdisciplinary coordinators from each colleg e, conducts a mid -semester preliminary review of all complete applications from individuals who satisfy the minimum admission requirements of the Graduate School. Applicants who do not meet the minimum admission requirements of the Graduate School will be denied admission (see Admissions for admission standards for each degree level). If the GIDP Committee finds the application to have merit, the Graduate School forwards the application materials to the appropriate GIDP Coordinator who contacts the discipli nes for their evaluation and recommendation. If the GIDP Committee finds the application to lack merit or compelling rationale for interdisciplinary studies, the Graduate School notifies the applicant of the committee 's concerns. Those applicants who recei ve such notification may resubmit their application materials after addressing the concerns of the GIDP Committee. Upon receipt of the application materials from the Graduate School, the GIDP Coordinator and the faculty in the appropriate disciplines evalu ate the application and recommend to the Graduate School that the applicant be granted or denied admission status. Each discipline recommending admission must designate an advisor and stipulate any additional academic requirements. All disciplines included in the proposal must recommend admission and must designate graduate faculty advisors before the Graduate School confers admission status. Program Criteria . The Plan of Study must meet the following criteria: 1. If the graduate faculty advisors determine a student has any course or degree deficiencies in their background, the proposal must list the course work necessary to alleviate those course or degree deficiencies. (Deficiency courses must be completed at the earliest possible date). 2. SRM 600 or one of the research -oriented substitute courses approved by the Graduate Council (master 's) or a twelve (12) hour research core (doctoral) must be proposed. The proposal must also contain at least one additional resea rch methods, statistics, or applied research courses (i.e. , computer science, tests/measurements, etc.). 3. Secondary disciplines (divisions/schools) are defined as those disciplines in which nine (9) to eleven (11) semester hours of course work are propos ed at the master 's levels or those disciplines in which nine (9) to 192| UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN COLORADO GRADUATE CATALOG 2022 -2023 fourteen (14) semester hours of course work are proposed at the doctoral level. If identified in the program proposal, these disciplines must assign an advisor and approve the selected cou rse work. 4. Proposed courses must be offered with sufficient frequency to allow completion of the degree requirements within a reasonable amount of time, e.g., two years for a thirty (30) semester hour program or three to four years for a sixty -four (64) semester hour program.

Our major areas of study are organized in 14 units designated as schools, departments or programs. These various disciplines give students a fuller understanding of the past, present, and future roles of both the individual and society in shaping human experience. The humanities and the social sciences are cornerstones of a liberal arts education. In courses and other learning experiences provided by the college, students become familiar with the most significant accomplishments of the human intel lect and spirit and gain appreciation for the potential we have as humans and as societies. Scholars in the humanities study many aspects of human existence, such as written and non -written evidence of human progress and how human creativity both reflects the world around us and helps to shape it. The humanities consider how systems of thought and knowledge have developed over time and how they continue to influence our decisions today. Humanistic inquiry asks how events in the past affect the present and h ow understanding the past can help us shape the future. The humanities produced the first thinkers who formally examined how different cultures and ethnicities approach common needs and how they express commonly held aspirations in diverse ways. Some human ities disciplines demonstrate how language mirrors our identity and opens windows to the world, while others study ways in which humans have learned to cooperate in order to articulate their values and accomplish their goals. With goals closely related to those of the humanities, the social sciences view the world around us as a laboratory for observation, experimentation, and the advancement of new ideas and practices. Social scientists strive to understand the human capacity for adapting to changing envir onments and circumstances. Some disciplines examine systems of exchange, communication, and organization. Others study the ways in which humans identify and assert themselves as individuals and as groups, and they learn from the experiences and interaction among people in different times, circumstances, and places. The College of Humanities and Social Sciences is committed to the liberal arts tradition of advancing human knowledge through serious scholarship, superior instruction, and the freedom of academi c inquiry. The faculty employs the latest teaching and learning technology while emphasizing accessibility and the benefits of student -teacher interaction. Humanities and Social Sciences majors are broadly educated to think critically and independently, to articulate ideas and appreciate diverse perspectives, and to exercise reason and make informed judgments. These tools prepare graduates for life in a complex world, help them enter a wide variety of professions, and lay the foundations for lifelong learni ng.

Zimmerman, M.F.A. The discipline of English deals with literature and language and other related subjects such as creative writing, film, folklore, myth, and cultural studies. Creative artists refuse to be limited in their subjects or app roaches. Literature, as one writer has said, is \"an eloquent artistic document, infinitely varied, of mankind 's journey; the autobiography of the race 's soul. \" The questions we ask in studying literature are as \"infinitely varied \" as those asked by poets, playwrights and novelists: What does it mean to be human? How is the individual related to society? By what values should one lead their life? The study of literature and language requires rigorous discipline and sensitivity, a strict adherence to the high est standards of logic, evidence and argumentation, as well as creative response to language and form. One learns to think, research and write critically, while simultaneously developing sensitivity to language and to the complexities of people and situati ons. English M.A. The master 's degree program provides focused, in -depth study of literature, practical experiences in literary criticism and research and opportunities for advanced levels of writing. Judicious selection of courses und er the guidance of the student 's advisor may provide additional focus to the program through special course clusters in areas such as pedagogy, literary theory, rhetoric/ composition, or specific periods of interests. Graduates of the program will be prepa red to enter a wide range of fields and/or to pursue additional advanced levels of study such as the Ph.D. in English. The program enables teachers currently in the field to develop special areas of interest, to pursue these in depth, and to enhance their skills in teaching, research, and writing. In addition, graduates can pursue professional study in law, theology, medicine (with appropriate science and mathematics preparation), library science, communications, media, and business. The M.A. in English is excellent preparation for any profession or occupation that stresses language usage, such as writing.
