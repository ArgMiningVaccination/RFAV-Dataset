We need to know you're here, and if applicable, update your patient information to keep it current. The admissions/registration process is the first part of your hospital visit, and an important step in ensuring a pleasant stay. We are located through the set of double doors next to the Emergency Services department entrance on Battersby Avenue. Between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m., you may enter the hospital via the sliding glass doors at the Emergency Services department or Registration entrance. Please ring the bell if the door is locked. You may use the ambulance ramp to drop someone off, but please don't park there. Each patient should bring his/her insurance card and an ID (driver's license, photo ID) for photocopying, emergency contact information, and your current employer's address and phone number. If your regular provider is located out of the area, then bring his/her contact information as well. In addition, you may be asked by the department to which you're being admitted to bring in X-ray films or other medical records. If you have a Living Will or Advance Directive, bring a copy so that it is made part of your medical record. If you have an appointed time for a test or procedure, please arrive 15 minutes early or as instructed by the scheduling staff in order to avoid delays. If staying overnight, please leave valuable items (jewelry, cash, credit cards, etc.) at home. If you have been sent to the hospital from your provider's office, you must register before being seen in the Emergency Services department. If your provider has sent you to the hospital to be admitted to any other department, keep in mind that we need orders from them before that admission can be completed. If you or a loved one is arriving by ambulance, your admission can be handled by the clerk, or a family member can provide us with the information we need. Planning ahead for your hospital visit will make the experience as comfortable as possible. The hospital needs to know your medical history. Bring a list of all medications and herbal supplements you take and also write down previous surgeries, resulting complications, problems related to an anesthesia, medications, or allergies. If staying overnight, bring any personal items you might need. If you are going home following a procedure, you will need someone to drive you.
