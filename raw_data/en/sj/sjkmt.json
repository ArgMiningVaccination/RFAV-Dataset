Using acoustic waves, this non-invasive therapy reduces the inflammatory response at the site of pain or injury. A form of treatment within Traditional Chinese Medicine, which uses thin needles to redirect the flow of energy in the body. An integrative approach to using natural foods and supplement intervention to improve overall health. Over the past ten years that I have worked with Dr. Cruz, I have come to appreciate the connection between emotional and physical healing. Early in 2020 she introduced me to a new ground braking device that uses non-invasive acoustic waves to regenerate tissue and joints. After just a few sessions I noticed a change in my ability to move without the knee pain and swelling that I had been limiting my agility for months. Along with NET that has addressed some emotional issues, the physical regeneration of my knee has allowed me to be active and enjoy cycling again, an activity I had given up. As I enter my mid-sixties, physical activity has become more crucial to my emotional well being. Dr. Cruz addresses the core issues that guide physical regeneration and overall well being. Dr. Cruz is an amazing healer!! She is insightful, intuitive, strong yet compassionate......a true gift. I worked with Dr. Cruz through pregnancy and postpartum recovery and she was there for me every step of the way. She helped to rebuild my strength and let's be honest, keep me loose. Dr. Cruz is an exceptional chiropractor who can work with both the physical and the energetic fields to understand and heal. Dr. Cruz truly cares for her patients. She is compassionate, knowledgeable, and highly intuitive with the body. As a dental assistant for over 20 years, I've had issues from head to toe. Dr. Cruz's skills to heal are unsurpassed and have helped me maintain my longevity in my physically demanding field. I'm grateful to have Dr. Cruz as my practitioner. Dr. Vicky Cruz at Full Moon Healing is our go-to healthcare practitioner for almost everything since 2008. She is an amazing compassionate, empathetic and intuitive healer. We can't speak highly enough at her ability to pinpoint the underlying health issues and suggested remedies while being straight forward with us. Using traditional chiropractic modalities as well as NET, we have relied on Dr. Vicky for any aches & pain for neck, back, shoulder, leg, knee, broken ankle, inflammation, digestion, overall health, nutrition, weight loss and emotional well being. We recommend her to all our friends, who have had similar experiences working with her. I have been a patient of Dr. Vicky Cruz for 14 years and since Day 1 my work with her has been transformative. From NET to the supplements Dr. Cruz has prescribed, my emotional and physical health and well being have improved in profound ways. Dr. Cruz is a gifted practitioner with immense knowledge and experience that compliment her intuitive healing. I respect and trust her beyond words can express. I have seen Dr. Cruz for the last decade receiving NET sessions at her office. Her sessions have been instrumental in helping me uncover and more clearly see the patterns and belief systems that effect my emotional and physical state of health. Her knowledge and experience goes way beyond NET, each session so full of wisdom and experience from her years of teaching, learning, and serving her community as a very dedicated and gifted holistic health provider. Thank you Dr. Cruz for inspiring me and encouraging me to bring the gift of NET into my own community and practice in SF! I have worked with Vicky Cruz for the last few years. It quickly became clear that my self-care depended on seeing her at least once a month otherwise my life would spin a bit out of control. Then I got the opportunity to see her once a week and within months my life leveled up significantly. NET has become a staple and main modality of my therapeutic process and I have seen significant changes to my personal growth without having to spin in my personal \"story\" or trauma for years on end. I highly recommend Vicky and NET all the time so if you're considering this process I say go for it. Dr. Cruz's work with me through NET has created profound shifts in my life. Dr. Cruz helped me to identify feelings from past trauma that I was not aware of, and then guided me in processing and clearing the pain from my body and consciousness. After working with Dr. Cruz, I am in the best emotional state I've ever been in. I can't recommend her enough. Dr. Cruz is an amazing healer. In a few sessions, my chronic back pain has vanished. I cannot thank her enough! I love Dr. Cruz's approach to healthcare. She is very tuned into your well being from a holistic viewpoint. I've been seeing Dr. Cruz for over a decade! Her approach, technique, knowledge, and expertise are all EXCELLENT. I'm always careful when making a referral for services and I have no hesitations referring Dr. Cruz. Dr. Cruz is an exceptional practitioner. She also has great intuition and really spends her time with me. "}
