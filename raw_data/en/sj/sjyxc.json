Beginning Wednesday, March 18, Julia Clarke, Certified Maharishi Wellness Consultant, will lead a [21-day Ayurvedic Detox Program](http://www.vailvitalitycenter.com/spring-cleanse-a-21-day-ayurvedic-program-for-immunity-regeneration-with-julia-clarke/), designed to optimize your metabolism, improve nutrient absorption, increase your energy, aid with weight loss and better your sleep. \"During the cleanse, we remove foods such as sugar and alcohol what may cause inflammation and toxic residue,\" Clarke explains. \"And we increase intake of fiber-rich foods and vegetables to decrease inflammation and promote a healthy digestion and elimination.\" The program includes a full recipe book, ongoing support, video lectures, a Kitchari cleanse kit, guided meditation, yoga and outdoor cardio. Clarke says Ayurveda (an ancient system of natural healing), is primarily concerned with purifying the body's tissues and channels for optimal health, which is directly related to the body's lymph system \u2014 responsible for immunity through the removal of waste and toxins in the tissues. \"An original concept of Ayurveda is 'Sroto Shuddhi,' which simply means, 'keep the channels clear,'\" Clarke shares. \"Ayurveda views the human physiology as a complex system of channels, all of which carry the potential to become blocked, and when fluids and energy cease flowing in the body, we stagnate and become ill.\" Get Your Lymph Moving One of the best ways to improve lymphatic circulation is by moving your body. \"Lymph, as we know, doesn't move by itself, so when we don't move our bodies, toxins don't get removed from our tissues,\" Clarke says. \"A static lifestyle equals low immunity, which explains why in a Western context, the stiller we become, the sicker we get.\" She says yoga is the primary means of exercise recommended for all body types, as well as brisk walks, dry brushing and massage. \"[In the detox,] we will also be learning how to give ourselves a self oil massage, which is an important daily ritual in Ayurveda,\" Clarke adds. Ayurveda has a very ancient and specialized massage techniques known as \"Pancha Karma,\" specifically designed to move lymph, which you can receive at Ayurvedic treatment centers. The Vail Vitality Center offers [vigorous massage treatments](http://www.vailvitalitycenter.com/massage/) to aid in lymph circulation as well. \"Keeping the lymph system open and flowing is a primary means of ensuring good health and immunity,\" Clarke says.
