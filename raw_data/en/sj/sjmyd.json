Dry Needling Trigger points are the areas in a taut band of muscle that are commonly tender and feel like knots. They typically form because of dysfunction and cause the muscle to be weak or inhibited. This leads to pain and discomfort. Dry needling is a very effective therapy in resolving that pain and normalizing movement. Acupuncture It is believed that when your energy (Qi) is blocked that imbalances will cause disease and pain. Acupuncture uses tiny monofilament needles placed into the skin along these channels to restore balance in the body. Supplements People use dietary supplements for a wide assortment of reasons. Some seek to compensate for diets, medical conditions, or eating habits that limit the intake of essential vitamins and nutrients. Other people look to them to boost energy or to get a good night's sleep. Speak with one of our trained professionals to learn more.
