Thus, our bodies physically hold memories of our life experiences, especially those experiences that have caused distressing emotions. MBHA understands that if we don't consciously attend to and address our emotional wounds our bodies will ensure we are cared for. This often looks like the manifestation of emotional and mental stress as physical aches, pain, illness and disease. Our therapists are trained to understand how our physical bodies hold onto and manifest emotional experiences, and include interventions in therapy to assist in identifying and resolving these body memories. It can be difficult to learn how to connect with our bodies after stressful life experiences. Biofeedback is a scientifically proven approach to teaching control of our physical processes through the use breath, guided thinking, and computerized real-time feedback.
