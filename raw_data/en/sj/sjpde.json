Greater than 89% effective in preventing people with health conditions, such as diabetes or obesity, from developing the COVID-19 virus with symptoms. 100% effective at preventing the COVID-19 virus in children ages 12 through 15. 91% effective in preventing the COVID-19 virus in children ages 5 through 11. Protection appears to fade over time. Moderna Effectiveness, original strain 94% effective at preventing the COVID-19 virus with symptoms. Greater than 90% effective in preventing people with health conditions, such as diabetes or obesity, from developing the COVID-19 virus with symptoms. Novavax Effectiveness, original strain 90% effective at preventing mild, moderate and severe illness with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus in people age 18 and older. 79% effective in people age 65 and older. Effectiveness, omicron strain Effectiveness, omicron strain Pfizer Effectiveness, omicron strain 64% to 68% effective at preventing hospitalization among adults with typical immune systems within two months of vaccination based on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates. 43% effective at preventing hospitalization among adults with weakened immune systems within four months of vaccination based on CDC estimates. Moderna Effectiveness, omicron strain 64% to 68% effective at preventing hospitalization among adults with typical immune systems within two months of vaccination based on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates. 43% effective at preventing hospitalization among adults with weakened immune systems within four months of vaccination based on CDC estimates. Novavax Effectiveness, omicron strain Appears to protect against severe COVID-19 due to COVID-19 variants Doses Doses Pfizer Doses Three doses are needed for unvaccinated children with typical immune systems ages 6 months through 4 years. The second shot is scheduled at least 3 to 8 weeks after the first. The third shot is given at least eight weeks after the second shot. One dose is needed for people age 5 and older who have a typical immune system. People age 65 and older and people of any age with weakened immune systems may get additional doses of the vaccine. This helps improve protection against the COVID-19 virus. Additional doses for people age 65 and older are suggested four months or longer after the last dose. Three doses are suggested for unvaccinated children ages 6 months through 4 years with weakened immune systems. The second dose is scheduled at least three weeks after the first shot. The third shot is scheduled at least eight weeks after that. Three doses for unvaccinated people 5 years and older with weakened immune systems. The second dose is scheduled at least three weeks after the first shot. The third shot is scheduled at least four weeks after that. Additional doses may be recommended two months after the last dose, or as suggested by a healthcare professional. Moderna Doses Two doses for unvaccinated children with typical immune systems age 6 months through 5 years. The second shot is scheduled 4 to 8 weeks after the first shot. One dose for people age 6 and older who have typical immune systems. People age 65 and older and people of any age with weakened immune systems may get additional doses of the vaccine. This helps improve protection against the COVID-19 virus. Additional doses for people age 65 and older are suggested four months or longer after a person's last dose. Three doses for unvaccinated people age 6 months and older with weakened immune systems. The second dose is recommended at least four weeks after the first shot. The third dose is recommended at least four weeks after the second shot. Additional doses may be recommended two months after the third shot, or as suggested by a healthcare professional. Novavax Doses Two doses are needed for age 12 and older, 3 to 8 weeks apart in the U.S. One dose of an mRNA vaccine is recommended at least two months after the second Novavax shot. People 18 and older who don't get the mRNA vaccine booster may get a Novavax booster six months after their last shot. People age 65 and older and people age 12 years and older with weakened immune systems who chose Novavax for vaccination can get an additional shot of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines at least four months after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine that they received. Additional doses may be recommended two months after the third shot, or as suggested by a healthcare professional.
