Growing resistance to antibiotics and a dramatic loss of research and development activities and capabilities present a severe public health challenge. The number of deaths directly caused by infections of drug-resistant bacteria is estimated at 48,000 patients per year in the United States and Europe alone; a toll that is assumed to increase substantially year by year. Estimates of the global death toll caused by antimicrobial resistance vary, but estimates of up to 700,000 annually have been brought forward.2 While the impact of antimicrobial resistance may still appear containable today, failure to address this challenge may lead to a serious and potentially uncontrollable global health threat, especially when considering that developing an antibiotic takes approxi - mately 10 years. Progress in the field of antibiotic resistance is therefore a global impera - tive for a sustainable health-care system. This report analyzes the reasons that have led to the decline in antibiotics research and development and proposes levers and measures to spark sustainable innovation in the area of antibiotics. Antibiotic approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have plummeted from 19 approvals in the years 1980-84 to only 1 in the years 2010-12. The analyses and recommendations are based on a review of the current literature, first - hand data analysis and interviews with experts from governments, public agencies, multi- lateral organizations, biotech companies, multinational pharmaceutical companies, and others. The current value chain for antibiotic research and development is broken. In each phase, major challenges for public and private research and development have been identified: \"Discovery void\" in basic research Major scientific challenges, especially in understanding ways to fight gram-negative bacteria, in combination with a lack of funding and a brain drain of antibiotics re - searchers, lead to scarcity of promising innovations. \"Valley of death\" in preclinical development The exit of numerous important players results in difficulties in translating scientific ideas into clinical successes. The reduced activity in this area is not compensated by new players entering the field. High cost and difficult patient recruitment in clinical development While the clinical development of antibiotics is less expensive than that of many oth - er therapeutic areas, developmental costs are still substantial (approximately \u20ac120 million) and are often prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Ad- ditionally, recruiting patients for clinical trials is a challenge given the acute treatment setting and a lack of accessibility of potentially suitable patients for trials. Insufficient alignment of regulatory requirements between leading regulatory agencies Remaining differences in regulatory approval requirements lead to additional cost and efforts for companies seeking market approval. Low market attractiveness in commercialization Low revenue expectations driven by necessary stewardship efforts and low prices make investments in antibiotics commercially unattractive. The low commercial at - tractiveness trickles down the value chain, leading to limited activity across all phases of the value chain. This report evaluates a range of possible solutions based on their potential to address the challenges described above. Based on the evaluation, we propose a bundle of the follow - ing ten levers, which are most effective when combined together but do not all have to be implemented at the same time: Lever 1: Target Product Profiles Develop global Target Product Profiles (TPPs) in order to steer research and develop - ment into the areas of the highest public health need and in order to have a globally accepted metric for the value of a new antibiotic. The Target Product Profiles will be based on the most urgent bacterial threats. Lever 2: Global Antibiotics Research Fund Create a fund that supports basic research at academic institutions and small and me - dium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The priorities of the fund will be based on a strategic research agenda in-line with the Target Product Profiles. Priorities of the fund could be research into gram-negative bacteria and point-of-care diagnostics. Lever 3: Global Antibiotics Research Prize Establish an annual prize rewarding scientific advancements in antibacterial research in order to increase the attractiveness of the research area and awareness for certain research challenges. Lever 4: Antibiotics Research and Development Database Implement a database of past and ongoing research projects that allows researchers to identify promising research approaches and avoid duplicating research efforts. Lever 5: Global Antibiotics Expert Network Set up a network of global antibiotics experts that supports ongoing research and de - velopment projects, especially those supported by the Global Antibiotics Research Fund and the partnerships in clinical development.

Partnerships in clinical development include fi - nancial support as well as in-kind support (e.g., access to experts and laboratories). Lever 7: Global Antibiotics Trial Platform Connect hospitals and developers through a global platform of antibiotics trials that allows matching suitable patients to ongoing antibiotics clinical trials. Lever 8: Global Alignment of Regulatory Approval Processes Continue the alignment of regulatory approval processes for antibiotics, ultimately leading to a unified global regulatory pathway for antibiotics. Lever 9: Market Entry Reward for Innovative Antibiotics Introduce a market entry reward for innovative antibiotics that meets the Target Product Profiles. The market entry reward has to be significant (i.e., in the order of \u20ac1,000 million) and will provide a reliable and predictable source of income that is delinked from sales volumes, thereby increasing the commercial attractiveness of an - tibiotics research and development. 1 2 3 46 79 108 5Basic researchPreclinical developmentClinical development Denition of target product proles Global antibiotics research fundPartnerships in clinical development Global antibiotics trial platformGlobal alignment of regulatory approval processesMarket entry reward for innovative antibiotics Reimbursement of innovative anti- biotics in hospitalsGlobal antibiotics research prize Antibiotics research & development database Global antibiotic expert networkDiscovery void \"Valley of death\"Dicult patient recruitment & high cost Insucient alignment between leading agencies worldwideLow market attractivenessMarket Stimulated research pipelineIncreased preclinical clinical testingExpedited market entry of new and necessary antibioticsIncreases availability of necessary antibiotics on the marketEects LeversFigure 1 | Overview of recommendations along the value chain Lever 10: Reimbursement for Innovative Antibiotics in Hospitals Ensure adequate reimbursement levels for innovative antibiotics, especially in a hos - pital setting. Public and private actors share the responsibility to overcome the challenge of antimicro - bial resistance. Therefore, we propose that market participants, e.g., pharmaceutical com - panies, contribute to financing the levers described above. Implementation, coordination, and controlling across different initiatives have been major challenges within the last years. In order to advance the implementation of the levers proposed above, we recommend setting up a dedicated global antibiotics collaboration platform. The creation of such a collaboration platform will show a strong long-term commitment, which is essential given the magnitude of the challenge ahead of us. The Boston Consulting Group 9 8 Breaking through the Wall We acknowledge that the terms \"antibiotics\" and \"antimicrobials\" are often used interchangeably (though antimicrobials is a broader term) in the relevant litera - ture. For clarity and readability we are using the term antibiotics in this report. In this re - port, this term will include natural and chemical compounds as well as targeted patho - gens, such as fungi and bacteria. The German Federal Ministry of Health commissioned an advisory consortium consisting of \u00d6PP Deutschland AG (Partnerships Germany), The Boston Consult - ing Group (BCG), and the Healthcare Management Department of Berlin University of Technology (TU Berlin) to form an expert opinion entitled Breaking through the Wall\u2014Enhancing Research and Development of Antibiotics in Industry and Science. This report is a summary of the expert opinion and its core statements. The report supports the Ger - man Global Union for Antibiotics Research and Development (GUARD) initiative. Growing resistance to antibiotics and a lack of new, innovative antibiotics entering the market present a severe public health challenge. This public health challenge is exacer - bated by a dramatic decrease in antibiotics research and development resources and ca - pabilities. As the development of resistance to antibiotics is inevitable, a healthy pipeline of new antibiotics is essential. This requires investments into the development of new, in- novative antibiotics. Experts agree that the current rate at which new, innovative antibi - otics are developed is not sufficient to cover the requirements for new antibiotics. This has sparked a debate on a national and international level as to how an increased re - search and development (R&D) output can be encouraged.The main objective of this report is to recommend a set of levers that stimulate research and development in antibiotics that address the most urgent public health needs on a global level. Based on an analysis of the root causes behind the current situation and an assessment of potential incentive mechanisms, we propose sustainable levers to increase innovation in antibiotic research and development. A further central proposition of this report is to develop a framework for implementation to support, expand and refocus existing exper - tise and capacities. This report is not a comprehensive review of all relevant aspects of antibiotic resistance. It rather seeks to propose a cohesive set of levers to enhance research and development of antibiotics in science and industry. Therefore, this report focuses on a single compo - nent of the antibiotic resistance\u2014the lack of new antibiotics being developed and brought to market. We acknowledge that a successful response to this challenge will also need to address overuse, misuse, and premature resistance (conservation), as well as glob - al access to antibiotics. The findings and recommendations described in this report are based on multiple sourc - es of information. These include, but are not limited to: Relevant scientific research and publications Firsthand data analysis of public and proprietary data Extensive expert interviews with diverse stakeholders (from research, industry, non- profit institutions, and the public sector) Experts from the working group \"Antibiotics\" of the German Pharma Dialog 1. OBJECTIVES OF THIS REPORTThe Boston Consulting Group 11 10 Breaking through the WallAntibiotics are live-saving drugs that need to be considered as a precious public good, as they are needed to cure and prevent the spread of bacterial infec- tions. The use of antibiotics also constitutes a negative externality: Every time an anti- biotic is used, there is a risk of bacteria developing resistance.3 Infections with antibi- otic-resistant bacteria can lead to direct mortality, jeopardize the effectiveness of other standard medical procedures, and place a heavy cost burden on health-care systems. Antibiotics are used around the globe\u2014in both human and animal health\u2014and resis-tance can spread among bacteria. Thus, antibiotic resistance is a global problem. 2.1 Avoiding Clinical Failure in the Field of Antibiotics 2.1.1 The Global Impact of Antibiotic Resistance While the impact of antibiotic resistance may still appear containable today, failure to ad- dress this challenge may lead to a serious and potentially uncontrollable global health threat, especially when considering that developing an antibiotic takes approximately 10 years.4 Therefore, it is critical that preventive action is taken now in order to avoid clini- cal failure in the coming decades. In the European Union and United States alone, it has been estimated that 48,000 pa- tients die per year as a direct consequence of infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria in both in- and outpatient settings.5 In many of these cases, an already weakened im- mune system is overpowered by the infection. Estimates of the global death toll caused by antimicrobial resistance vary, but estimates of up to 700,000 annually have been brought forward. 6 While exact predictions of the future mortality caused by drug-resistant bacteria are very difficult, available forecasts, are as high as 10 million annual deaths worldwide by 2050.This illustrates the potential magnitude of the problem and the conse- quences of in action. 7 Approximately 20,000 patients worldwide are estimated to die each year as a direct con-sequence of drug-resistant bacterial infections acquired during surgery. 8 Both routine sur- geries, such as hip and knee replacements, and emergency surgeries are becoming in- creasingly risky for patients. In addition to surgery, routine medical procedures such as using a catheter or intravenously administering fluids can potentially cause life-threaten- ing bloodstream infections if resistance spreads further. Thus, antibiotic resistance threat-2. ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE: A GLOBAL HUMANITARIAN CHALLENGEens the effectiveness of medical procedures that we have grown accustomed to, which, in a worst-case scenario, may catapult us into a \"medical dark age\"9. An additional aspect of the antibiotic resistance challenge is the economic burden of in-creased mortality and morbidity. For example, within the EU it is estimated that the cur- rent cost of antibiotic resistance amounts to \u20ac1.5 billion annually. 10 This includes in- creased health-care costs caused by additional hospital stays, expensive treatment, isolation measures and loss of productivity. Cost associated with antibiotic resistance is expected to increase dramatically over the upcoming decades. Antibiotic resistance there- fore stretches the capacity of health-care systems around the globe and impacts our so- cial and economic system. Low-income regions in particular are expected to experience the greatest burden. 11 2.1.2 Use of Antibiotics Is Reducing Their Effectiveness Some of the most common bacterial pathogens have been reported to exhibit 50% or more resistance against commonly used antibiotics (figure 2). 12 In all of the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions, these very high resistance rates have been found for three common bacteria strains, demonstrating that resistant bacteria are an increasing concern.

In Germany, for example, the share of antibiotics of last resort in all antibiotics prescrip- tions has risen steadily over the past 20 years reaching 46.5% in 2010 (figure 3).23 Antibiotics of last resort as a percentage of all antibiotics 50 1991 1992 1993 199419951996 1997 19981999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006200720082009201045 4035 30 201510 50 Wissenschaftliches Institut der AOK. September 2010.Figure 3 | Increasing use of antibiotics of last resort in Germany 2.1.3 Few New Treatment Options Coming to Market As existing antibiotics of last resort slowly become a more common treatment and thus also lose their efficacy, new antibiotics are needed to serve as the next generation of anti- biotics of last resort. Unfortunately, the market participants traditionally developing and launching new antibiotics have largely left the field. Of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide which were active in antibiotics research in the 1990s, only four re- main in this field in 2014. 24 Consequently, approvals of new antibiotics by the FDA have steadily declined, reaching an all-time low in 2010-2012 (figure 4).25 2.1.4 Summary Antibiotics save lives and prevent the spread of bacterial infections. However, the use of antibiotics also promotes the development of antibiotic resistance, which can lead to in- creased mortality, morbidity and cost. The consumption of antibiotics has increased worldwide, including use of antibiotics of last resort. Thus, new antibiotics are urgently needed to complement existing ones. However, the rate at which new antibiotics are ap-proved is insufficient to satisfy the demand. This development can potentially have dra- matic consequences if no action is taken.This includes bacteria such as K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and S. aureus all of which can cause bloodstream infections and other diseases. In all three examples, the drug-resistant bacte-rium was found to cause a statistically significant increase in mortality attributable to the infection when compared to the drug-susceptible form. 13 The wide use of antibiotics will exacerbate this development. Increased Global Use Is Causing Antibiotic Resistance Global antibiotic consumption in human medicine has been reported to have increased by 36% between 2000 and 2010. This trend is largely driven by increased consumption in Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.14 Only in developed countries such as the US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and many other EU countries, a slight decline in the use of antibiotics has been observed.15 In veterinary medicine, a global increase of antibiotic consumption of 67% between 2010 and 2030 has been forecasted if no addi-tional measures are taken to restrict use. 16 The use of antibiotics in food-producing ani- mals can lead to resistance development, which can also affect humans through the envi- ronment or consumption of these animal products.17 Particularly worrying are estimates that up to half of all antibiotics are unnecessarily or incorrectly taken. 18 For example, many patients demand antibiotics for the treatment of the common cold. Physicians could therefore be under pressure to prescribe antibiotics even though they are not needed. 19 Efforts to reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics have been made, with differing success rates across countries and between inpatient and outpatient settings.20 Lack of Point-of-Care Diagnostics Exacerbates the Problem The lack of point-of-care diagnostic tools is a major obstacle that prevents physicians from prescribing antibiotics in a targeted manner. While promising innovations in rapid point-of- care diagnostics have been made, standard diagnostics often still require at least one day.21 Physicians therefore frequently prescribe antibiotics based on symptoms with no definitive diagnosis of the causative bacteria. This results in the prescription of antibiotics for nonbac- terial infections as well as antibiotics which have no efficacy against the causative patho- gen. Increased Use of Antibiotics of Last Resort is not Sustainable Antibiotic resistance is spreading, and so is the use of antibiotics of last resort. Between 2000 and 2010, global consumption of two classes of antibiotics of last resort rose signifi- cantly: carbapenems by 45% and polymyxins by 13%. 22 This is a troubling development, 13 Antimicrobial Resistance: Global Report on Surveillance.

Like other gram-negative bacteria, it has an outer membrane whose properties make it more challenging to design effective antibiotics. Global levels of antibiotic resistance in K. pneumoniae have reached 40% thus far in 2015, and mortality rates in the range of 47-66% have been reported for patients infected with specific drug-resistant K. pneumoniae strains.33 Similar trends are also observed with other drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria.34 2.2 Addressing the Greatest Public Health Threats Posed by Bacteria 2.2.1 Not All Bacteria Equally Dangerous Pathogenic bacteria vary in their infection rates, resistance levels, and morbidity and mortality rates. These factors can be used to estimate the public health threat that vari - ous bacteria pose. Different groups have developed lists of the most relevant bacterial threats, including the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration), and EMA (European Medicines Agency).26 In a US-specific report published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 17 groups of bacteria were classified into three threat lev - els: urgent, serious, and concerning. Three groups of bacteria were classified into the highest threat level of \"urgent\": C. difficile, which is estimated to be responsible for 14,000 deaths annually in the United States, Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which have become resistant to nearly all antibiotics and cause approximately 600 deaths per year, and drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, which is responsible for 246,000 infected pa - tients per year.27 Infection rates and resistance development vary across regions and comprehensive sur - veillance is often lacking.287 At present, it is challenging to assess the global health threat that specific bacteria pose and what regions are most affected. In particular, assessments of the dynamic resistance development are dependent upon high-quality surveillance not yet established globally. Setting up and improving national surveillance systems is therefore essential to allow a targeted and specific approach to combating antibiotic re - sistance. 26 Antimicrobial Resistance: Global Report on Surveillance; WHO Report.

This chapter provides an in-depth look into the challenges that exist along the value chain of antibiotic research and development. While challenges exist along the entire value chain for public and private players alike, the two major challenges are the low commercial attractiveness of antibiotics and a lack of promising leads in basic re - search. This combination is unique to antibiotics. While other therapeutic areas also face scientific challenges, the incentive to tackle these challenges is much higher if there is a commercially attractive market. This can be seen in therapeutic areas like Alzheimer's disease, in which immense resources are mobilized because of the com - mercial attractiveness of a potential breakthrough drug even though the scientific problems are highly complex and challenging. This chapter will take the reader through each step of the value chain, analyzing poten - tial challenges from the perspectives of the main stakeholders involved. 3.1 Challenges in Basic Research and Preclinical Development In this report, basic research refers to the general knowledge of biological processes and the discovery of potential targets for new antibiotics. Basic research is a main prerequi - site for discovering new antibiotic candidates that could subsequently enter preclinical development. 3.1.1 Changing Landscape of Active Participants The top patent filers in antibiotics research across all players between 2001 and 2013 have been pharmaceutical companies. However, the interest of large pharmaceutical 3.

Especially the use of narrow-spectrum antibiot - ics, which are effective only against one or few types of bacteria, is suffering from this challenge. Therefore, it is essential to not only develop new drugs against bacteria but to also devel - op the diagnostics that allow rapid and targeted use of existing and potential new treat - ments. 2.2.4 Summary There are substantial variations in resistance levels among different bacteria, and not all drug-resistant bacterial infections are equally dangerous. It is therefore important to as - sess the potential health threat of different bacteria. Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria are widely considered an urgent public health threat. Additionally, developing point-of-care diagnostics is important to ensure that antibiotics can be used in a targeted manner. The Boston Consulting Group 19 18 Breaking through the Wall companies in antibiotics declined during that time, as an analysis of the patent applica - tion activity of the top 100 pharmaceutical companies shows (top 100 based on world - wide sales) (figure 8).35 The number of antibiotic patents filed by the top five patent filers from the pharmaceutical industry decreased even more dramatically from over 40 patent families per year in 2001 to only ten in 2013 (figure 10). This is concerning, since the pharmaceutical industry has tra - ditionally been a key contributor to antibiotic development, and its re-engagement into an - tibiotics research is urgently needed to reverse the loss of innovation in antibiotics. The low interest of pharmaceutical companies in antibiotic research is exemplified by the following statistic: in the past 11 years, the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies based on global sales have filed significantly more patents in rare disease research and vaccines than antibiotics (figure 9). While there have been 1,195 patents filed in antibiot - ics between 2004 and 2015, that number is almost twice as high in vaccines (2,113 pat - ents) and 7 times as high in rare diseases (8,689 patents). Academic institutions traditionally play an important role in the early-stage discovery of drugs. The top 100 academic institutions in terms of patents filed related to antibiotics between 2001 and 2013 have increased their patent application activity. Despite this posi - tive development, funding for antibiotics research from both governmental institutions and pharmaceutical companies is still insufficient.

Figure 10 | Interest from the top 5 players is declining rapidlyFigure 9 | Top 10 pharmaceutical companies focus on other areasThe Boston Consulting Group 21 20 Breaking through the Wall The development described above constitutes a significant change in the landscape of antibiotic research and discovery. Industry players are leaving research and public and academic institutions are slowly increasing their efforts without fully compensating for the industry's exit. 3.1.2 Loss of Talent Threatening Research and Preclinical Development Activity The closure of centers for antibiotics research and the steady exit of the pharmaceutical industry from antibiotics research have a direct effect on the researcher community. One of the greatest concerns in antibiotics research and development is the ongoing brain drain as researchers exit the area.37 Multiple experts interviewed for this report have esti - mated that there are as few as 250-500 dedicated experts actively researching in the area of antibiotics, approximately half of those in academic and public institutions and half in pharmaceutical companies. This development has progressed so far that one interviewed stakeholder called antibiotics researchers \"an endangered species. \" The steady exit of often older researchers is accompanied by difficulties in attracting new researchers for anti-infectives research. In the United States, for example, there are only 0.8 applicants per available fellowship and medical residency in this area. This is signifi - cantly lower than in other research areas, such as cardiovascular diseases (1.4 applicants per position) and neurology (2.5 applicants per position).38 3.1.3 Traditional Research and Discovery Approaches Less Effective for Antibiotics The \"golden era of antibiotic discovery\" lasted roughly from 1945 to 1960. Since then, there has been a strong decline in the number of novel antibiotic classes. One of the reasons for the \"discovery void\" in antibiotics is the failure of the dominant drug discovery strategies that have been applied in recent years. It was thought that the advance of bacterial genom - ics (the study of bacterial DNA) and modern in-vitro, target-based approaches would lead to many new antibiotic discoveries. Although such methods proved successful in other ar - eas, they have not yet yielded the desired results in the area of antibiotics. 3.1.4 The Valley of Death in Preclinical Development Experts from both academic institutions and the pharmaceutical industry frequently point out the gap that exists between basic research and clinical development. One inter - viewee described this gap as the \"valley of death\" (figure 11). The main problem is that preclinical development is more expensive than basic research on a per-compound basis. Preclinical development is primarily conducted in direct preparation for clinical develop - ment. If clinical development is not commercially attractive, there will be little activity in preclinical development as well. The consequence, in the words of another expert, is that \"there is a cemetery of good ideas\". 3.1.5 Mostly Isolated Efforts in Preclinical Development The \"valley of death\" mentioned above can be attributed in part to a lack of exchange be - tween academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies, although good examples of cooperation exist. This effect is highlighted by an analysis of the patent citation network. In the following diagram, two players are connected with a line when the published Basic ActivityFigure 11 | The \"valley of death\" in antibiotics research and development patent of one player references the patent of another player (the arrow points toward the cited player). Few patents published in the area of antibiotics cite existing patents (figure 12).39 This low degree of connectedness indicates a potential area of improvement. Im- proving the connectedness of the most important organizations and individuals will be paramount to improve the effectiveness of preclinical development. Inefficiency and duplication of efforts has also been repeatedly mentioned during expert interviews and in literature. 40 Especially failed and abandoned projects are not made available for the scientific community.

For example, Sanofi and Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (Fraunhofer IME)41 have created an institute for research of natural compounds. It allows Sanofi to access Fraunhofer's extensive database of microorgan - isms, while Fraunhofer IME can benefit from Sanofi's expertise in developing anti-infec - tives. 3.1.6 Summary of Challenges in Basic Research and Preclinical Development The top pharmaceutical companies are leaving basic research and preclinical develop - ment in antibiotics. Other players, notably academic institutions, are increasing their en - gagement in the area but do not compensate the lack of activity from large pharmaceuti - cal companies, given insufficient funding and the low prestige of antibiotics research. The resulting brain drain from the area of antibiotic research leads to a loss of decades of valuable research experience; experience which is desperately needed to make progress on the scientific challenges of antibiotic development, especially for gram-negative bacte - ria, and refill the \"discovery void\" in basic research. In basic research and preclinical development, the lack of exchange across active players leads to duplicated efforts and inefficient resource allocation. A revival of basic research and preclinical development must therefore address issues of coordination, funding and talent recruiting and retention. 3.2 Challenges in Clinical Development Clinical development encompasses trials that test the safety and efficacy of an antibiotic in humans. As with other drugs, clinical trials are typically split into three main phases, which differ in duration, length, number of volunteers/patients, and objectives.42 3.2.1 Cost of Developing for Antibiotics Lower Than for Other Drugs but still Significant Antibiotics that pass through the \"valley of death\" in the preclinical phase (discussed in 3.1.5) and enter clinical development have relatively high rates of success (figure 13).43 The high success rate in clinical development is partly driven by animal models being more reliable for antibiotics than for other therapeutic areas. This particularly applies to preclinical toxicity, where animals are used to estimate possible toxicity in humans. The guinea pig, for example, is frequently used to study antibiotics because it is highly sensi - tive to them.44 The overall high success rates in later development phases and the good predictability of animal models allow for development programs to \"fail early\", reducing the cost of developing antibiotics. The success rates for pharmaceuticals in general are significantly lower (e.g., phase II success rate: 30%; phase III success rate: 59%) These low - er success rates increase the typical cost of clinical trials significantly.4511.8% 33.0% 59.3% 75.8% 79.7% ApprovalCommer- cializationTotal Source: Securing New Drugs for Future Generations: The Pipeline of Antibiotics. The Review on Antimicrobial Resistance. May 2015.Figure 13 | Success rates in clinical development of antibiotics Still, clinical development is an expensive endeavor that has been estimated to cost around \u20ac120 million on average per marketed antibiotic.46 This excludes the cost of fail - ure for compounds that did not make it to the market and the cost of marketing the anti - biotic. Thus, total development cost of an antibiotic is significantly higher and is estimat - ed to be about \u20ac700-1,100 million.47 This includes the clinical costs described above and investments in basic and preclinical development where large investments are necessary to test many compounds in the hopes of finding a lead compound for further develop - ment. Seeking approval and marketing the product require further significant invest - ments. The resources required for clinical development are prohibitively high for small and me - dium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and academic institutions. This is reflected in the observa - tion that only 4% of antibiotics in clinical development belong to academic institutions. Furthermore, academic institutions are not active in phase III trials of antibiotics, which are significantly more expensive than phase I and II trials).48 3.2.2 Largest Pharmaceutical Companies Not Active Investors in Development With the exit of the largest pharmaceutical companies from antibiotics research and de - velopment (R&D), their contribution to innovation is also declining. In 2014, only 15% of the antibiotics in clinical development belonged to one of the top 25 pharmaceutical companies (figure 14, right chart).49 This signifies a substantial loss in investment poten - tial in antibiotic research and development and stands in strong contrast to the fact that the top 25 pharmaceutical companies spend approximately two-thirds of the world's pharmaceutical R&D budget (figure 14, left chart). 50 41 Fraunhofer Institut f\u00fcr Molekularbiologie und Angewandte \u00d6kologie [Institute for Molecular and Applied Ecology]. 42 The FDA's Drug Review Process: Ensuring Drugs Are Safe and Effective.

EvaluatePharma. 2014.The Boston Consulting Group 25 24 Breaking through the Wall Smaller pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms specialized in anti-infectives (e.g., antibiotics, antimicrobials) are now the primary investors in antibiotics, along with selected academic institutions. Supporting these innovative small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) in financing the later stages of clinical development will have a posi - tive impact on the antibiotics pipeline. 3.2.3 Operational Challenges in Running Clinical Trials Clinical trials in antibiotics have the major advantage of being very short compared to other indications. For example, antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infections is typical - ly limited to three days, for community-acquired pneumonia to five days, and for ventila - tor-associated pneumonia to eight days.51 The FDA, for example, requires endpoints as short as 48-72 hours after treatment initiation for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.52 Unfortunately, the flip side to short treatment times is that many bacterial infections are acute.53 The interviewed experts repeatedly emphasized the difficulty of recruiting pa - tients with acute infections, as the time window to identify patients and initiate treatment is very narrow. The lack of unified patient databases leads to a significant logistical and administrative effort when trying to recruit a sufficient number of patients for clinical tri - als. The situation is further complicated by the lack of rapid point-of-care diagnostics, in- creasing the challenge of recruiting patients with infections caused by specific bacteria. Within the EU, initial steps to address this issue have been initiated by the CLIN-Net (Clinical-Net) project of the COMBACTE (Combating Bacterial Resistance in Europe) pro - gram, which was initiated in 201354. CLIN-Net aims to support and coordinate clinical tri - als of antibiotics by developing a network of qualified clinical trial sites. While this is an important step forward, it is solely focused on the EU. Similar initiatives with a more global scope would be required to truly overcome the challenge of recruiting patients for clinical trials in antibiotics. 3.2.4 Lack of Practitioners with Required Skills Because bacterial infections can occur in different tissues, clinical trials in antibiotics can require medical expertise ranging from dermatology to gynecology to internal medi - cine.55 This wide range of expertise poses a challenge in training practitioners to carry out clinical trials for antibiotics according to necessary standards. Interviews with experts have revealed that the lack of practitioners experienced in antibiotics trials poses a chal - lenge in conducting them appropriately. The lack of interest in fellowships and medical residencies in the area of anti-infectives (discussed in chapter 3.1.2) further exacerbates this problem. 3.2.5 Summary of Challenges in Clinical Development Despite the relatively good success rates of antibiotic candidates in clinical development, the clinical development of antibiotics is still a costly endeavor. The high cost associated with clinical development often prevents SMEs and academic institutions from advancing antibiotics throughout the different development phases, thereby excluding important in - novators. Across all phases, recruiting patients and finding medical practitioners that are experienced in clinical trials are challenges that particularly affect antibiotic development. 3.3 Challenges in Market Approval A common challenge faced by drug developers is that approval processes between regu - latory authorities are not aligned in all regards.56 Persisting differences incur additional costs because clinical trials have to be designed to fulfill the different requirements of regulatory authorities around the globe. According to Elias Zerhouni, president of global R&D at Sanofi, the company spends \"20% of [its] R&D budget trying to mix and match in order to do the convergence between different systems.\" 57 While this effect is not specific to antibiotics, it increases development cost and effort for antibiotics in a market that is already commercially unattractive (discussed in chapter 3.4.4). The additional costs and delay of market entries resulting from remaining differences in the approval process have been recognized, and transnational efforts have been initiated to improve the alignment of approval processes. TATFAR, the Transatlantic Taskforce on Antimicrobial Resistance, was established in 2009. Its goals are to improve cooperation between the United States and the EU in the appropriate therapeutic use of antimicrobial drugs, the prevention of infections, and strategies for promoting the development of antimicrobial drugs. Since the inception of TATFAR, both the EMA and FDA have published individual, detailed guidelines regard - ing the appropriate design of clinical trials for antibiotics.58 pharmaceutical companies Academic institutions67% (\u20ac95B)33% (\u20ac46B) 1 EvaluatePharma. 2014. 2 The group \"Remaining Pharma\" is composed of the 2033 next-largest pharmaceutical firms Figure 14 | Worldwide R&D investments and clinical activity in antibiotics in 2014 51 General Principles of Antimicrobial Therapy.

These in - clude, but are not limited to: Selection criteria for patients in clinical trials. From the expert interviews con - ducted for this report, we have gathered that patient recruitment is more restrictively regulated by the FDA than by its European counterpart, the EMA.59 Regulation re - garding prior exposure to antibiotic treatments excludes some patients for FDA trials that could be included according to EMA regulation.60 Definition of clinical endpoints. An example of a different definition of clinical endpoints is the phase III trials of the antibiotic of Cempra Pharmaceuticals solithro - mycin (to treat community acquired pneumonia). The FDA capped measurement of the primary endpoint for non-inferiority at 72 hours after treatment was initiated. In contrast, the EMA allowed primary endpoint measurements to be conducted 5-10 days after the end of therapy.61 In interviews conducted for this report, public-sector officials who are engaged in current antibacterial approval processes stated that the FDA and EMA are already working together for antibiotic approvals. Specification of statistical parameters. The parameters defined for specific statis - tics can differ between agencies. This can be a challenge for trial design. An example is the recent phase III trials for the broad-spectrum antibiotic eravacycline.62 While the FDA required a 10% noninferiority margin, the EMA accepted a 12.5% noninferiority margin. Expedited approval for antibiotics. From 2010 to 2014, the US Food and Drug Ad - ministration (FDA) granted priority review to 71% of anti-infectives, while the EMA used accelerated assessment for 38% of anti-infectives.63 Greater differences can be observed among regulatory authorities not included in TATFAR efforts.64 The practical impact of different approval pathways and regulations across major regulatory agencies becomes visible when comparing approval timelines for anti-infectives and the share of anti-infectives that receive an expedited review (figure 15).65 A globally unified approval process could potentially reduce those differences and is called for by both interviewed experts and the literature, though significant legal challenges exist.66317 305551 248 242262 PMDA EMA FDAExpeditedStandard65%71% anti-infectives granted review 2010-2014 Note: EMA: European Medicines Agency, EU.

Still, the remaining differences result in higher complexity in trial design and result in increased resource investments (e.g., time, planning, and direct cost of trials) for the players conducting the clinical trials. 3.4 Challenges in Commercialization The market for antibiotics has massively lost attractiveness over the last decades. From around 20 of the largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide being active in antibiotics research in the 1990s, only four remained in 2014.67 Many of the major pharmaceutical companies have scaled back efforts, carved out antibiotics departments into separate companies, or left the area entirely.68 Roche reentering the area is an exception to this overall trend and does not likely reflect a turnaround of the pharmaceutical industry's view on the attractiveness of the antibiotics market. These developments cannot be ex - plained with any single reason; they are the result of multiple factors and trends acting together. The commercialization of antibiotics is a market which is attractive for other players be - sides the largest pharmaceutical companies. Small and medium sized biotech companies for example (see chapter 3.2.2) are considered important innovators in the field. 67 Roche returns to antibiotic research as superbug threat grows. Reuters.

The Boston Consulting Group 29 28 Breaking through the Wall3.4.1 Increased Focus on Most Profitable Therapeutic Areas An analysis of the shareholder returns (the financial performance of a company's stock over time) shows that an increased focus on a small number of therapeutic areas has been rewarded by the capital markets. Pharmaceutical companies with fewer therapeutic areas were able to achieve a substantially higher total shareholder return (TSR)\u201431% vs. 18% on average (see figure 16). In figure 16, focus is measured by therapeutic areas (TAs), which account for at least 75% of revenue. Success on the financial market is measured by TSR: The total return of a stock to an investor (capital gain plus dividends). Under pressure from the financial markets, publicly traded pharmaceutical companies evaluate their portfolio with increased scrutiny to identify the areas that promise the highest return on investment. Unprofitable or marginally profitable therapeutic areas are sold or terminated to increase focus on the most profitable areas. This trend adds to the challenge of turning around the past developments in the thera- peutic area of antibiotics. Achieving marginal profitability for the therapeutic area will not be sufficient enough to reignite the interest of pharmaceutical companies, as the area of antibiotics is in direct competition with other, more profitable therapeutic areas. An ef- fective bundle of levers will have to make sure that the attractiveness of the antibiotics market can compete with other therapeutic areas.3.4.2 Low Expected Sales Volume The low expected sales volume of antibiotics is one of the biggest inherent challenges of this therapeutic area. It is a significant deterring factor for pharmaceutical companies. Revenue estimations for antibiotics are low and volatile for multiple reasons: New antibiotics entering the market can be designated as antibiotics of last resort. Paradoxically, the more innovative a product is, the less it might be used, as more nov- el and innovative treatments are rightfully more restrictively used. The designation of a new antibiotic as an antibiotic of last resort means that it is only to be used as a last method of treatment when all other attempts have failed. These restrictions can re- duce sales volumes significantly and thus makes the development commercially more risky and less attractive. The appearance of resistance within the relevant bacterial strains has been detected increasingly quickly (see chapter 2.1.2). The detection of resistance does not render an antibiotic useless, but it can still significantly impact how often it will be pre- scribed and sold. Most innovative antibiotics are initially used in the hospital setting. Hospitals are usu-ally, at least implicitly, expected to pay for these from their regular budget or income from DRG-like (diagnosis related group) reimbursement. The use of innovative antibi- otics may be limited by inadequate reimbursement. 3.4.3 Prices for Antibiotics Mostly Low Compared to Other Lifesaving Medicine The prices for antibiotics in the ambulatory care setting (i.e. those which are prescribed by physicians and distributed via community pharmacies) have been relatively low com- pared to other potentially lifesaving medicines. While this enables widespread access, the downside of low prices is the lack of commercial attractiveness for the developer. Antibi- otics are often seen as a commodity. The willingness to pay a high price for, e.g., a hepati-tis C treatment is significantly larger than for antibiotics. Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi\u00ae), a new treatment for hepatitis C, entered the US market in 2014 with a price tag of \u20ac900 per pill. A 12-week course of Sovaldi\u00ae costs \u20ac75,500. Cancer treatments typically achieve prices over \u20ac90,000 over the course of treatment lasting a year. 69 In contrast, many antibiotics treatments are often less than \u20ac40 over the course of a treatment lasting a week.70 In some cases, higher prices can be achieved for antibiotics (see below). These prices are still significantly lower than for treatments for hepatitis C and/or cancer. Reimbursability of new pharmaceuticals (i.e. that third-party payers cover the costs) is in many countries based on an assessment of additional benefit to patients vs. existing al- ternatives and/or its cost-effectiveness. The degree of additional benefit will be crucially dependent on what is considered to be the appropriate comparator. Since most antibiotic classes were invented decades ago, patent protection has expired and generics dominate the market. In Germany, for example, generics maintain over 95% of market share for the most popular antibiotic products. 71 01020304050 High LowFocus (No. of T As1)\" We focused on fewer disease areas, prioritizing only the highest quality, most-needed investigational therapies that would deliver unquestionable value\" Pharmaceutical executive \"As we move into 2015, we will continue to rigorously sharpen our focus\"Pharmaceutical executive Most pharmaceutical rms aim to focus their portfoliosAvg.

Fidaxomicin (Dificid\u00ae), a first-in-class narrow-spectrum antibiotic to treat C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) that was approved in 2011,72 has an aver - age wholesale price of $3,360 for a 10-day treatment regimen. In comparison, vancomycin, which treats the same type of infection, costs $1,392.80 for a 10-day treatment plan. The third treatment option for the infection is a generic drug, metronidazole, which costs a mere $20.70 for a 10-day treatment program.73 This illustrates that truly innovative anti - biotics can achieve relatively high prices on the market. 3.4.4 Current Business Model Does Not Work for Antibiotics In a conventional pharmaceutical business model, revenue is determined by the volume sold and the price of a product. Innovative drugs add significant benefit compared to exist - ing treatments, therefore they often achieve higher prices and larger volumes (figure 17). Low volumes for antibiotics, low prices (or higher prices in combination with highly limit - ed use), and the high cost of development make an unattractive business case for antibi - otics. For an example calculation, the following assumptions were used: Total development costs of around \u20ac800 million (estimation based on literature74) Peak sales of \u20ac300 million as a base for calculating total sales (in-line with recent anti - biotic launches) Discount rate of 10% (based on cost of capital for pharmaceutical companies) Development time of eight years (in-line with recent antibiotic launches) 12-year patent protection on the market (in-line with recent antibiotic launches) Based on the above assumptions, the net present value (NPV), for the development and commercialization of a new antibiotic is actually negative (see figure 18).

A barely positive return on investment (RoI), meaning the benefit of an invest - ment, however, will not be enough to have a significant impact on pharmaceutical com - panies feeling intense market pressure and being under scrutiny from capital markets. 3.4.5 Summary of Challenges in Commercialization The market for antibiotics is commercially unattractive because of low expected sales volumes and prices. The necessary financial investments in development are so large that a relevant business opportunity in the form of a significantly positive net present value is a prerequisite for interest and investments in this therapeutic area. This is true for big pharmaceutical companies and small biotech start-ups alike. To turn this trend around, any set of levers will be judged by the \"business case\" it cre - ates for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. This business case must also consider the necessary investments into capabilities (hiring/maintaining/training staff and cost for facilities) that are prerequisites for any meaningful investment into an antibiotic candi - date. 3.5 Overview of Challenges Along the Value Chain The negative trend in research and development for antibiotics is not due to a singular reason. Multiple challenges appear along the value chain. Figure 20 presents an overview.There is a wide range of potential levers available to policy makers. Figure 21 il - lustrates a list of levers discussed in this section. These levers are potential op - tions for resolving the identified challenges along the value chain. They can be divided into levers that target the early phases of the value chain (including basic research and preclinical and clinical development) and levers that are applied later in the value chain (market approval and commercialization). Levers employed early in the value chain are referred to as \"push\" incentives, lowering the barriers of market entry for developers by reducing the costs of research and development (R&D). Complementary to more conventional levers, such as directly subsidizing research and specific tax in - centives, newer tools and concepts have been developed. Their aims are to increase access to knowledge, speed up its diffusion, and foster new constellations of expertise and more collaborative solutions. Levers applied later in the value chain are referred to as \"pull\" incentives, tending to target the removal of regulatory inefficiencies or in - crease the attractiveness of the market and the return on investment for pharmaceuti - cal developers and manufacturers. These \"pull\" incentives include refinements to the existing patent-driven system intellectual property (IP) extensions, reimbursement top-ups), decoupling the innovation from the volume of sales (delinkage models) and hybrid models which lie in between (partial delinkage). 4.

The levers which are most suited to help overcome the challenges are combined into a comprehensive bundle. In order to make sure that the chosen levers work together and complement each other by ideally developing synerget - ic effects, possible interactions between the levers were considered during the selection process as well. The result of this process is a comprehensive combination of levers that has the potential to reverse the trend in antibiotic research and development and lead to the development of innovative antibiotics in high-need areas. The recommended levers are further de - tailed in chapter 5. 4.1 Incentives Primarily Targeting Basic Research and Preclinical Development Definition of Target Product Profile (TPP) Examples of specific tools: lists of most urgent threats, lists of high priority agents. The public health threat resulting from different bacteria varies greatly. TPPs specify de - sired optimal and minimum required characteristics of a product, e.g., the pathogens that a product should be effective against.75 A TPP could define the most urgent threats based on global unmet medical need. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for example, has developed a list of the most urgent bacterial threats in the United States. Similar efforts are underway in Europe. The TPPs would provide the basis for any support in research, development, and com - mercialization in that only products meeting the requirements specified in the TPPs be - ing eligible for (full) support. In order to account for the changing resistance pattern of bacteria, TPPs would have to be periodically updated. Main advantages Main challenges +Allows for focus to be on the most-needed antibiotics according to public health priorities +Avoids funding of nonpriority antibiotics +Supports strategic research agenda for antibiotics Changes in threat level of bacteria uncertain Current surveillance capability limits understanding of bacterial threat dynamics Research funding Examples of specific tools: project grants, subsidies, fellowships, career establishment grants.Funding to boost basic research and preclinical development can be targeted at different levels: 1) individuals 2) research groups, or 3) institutions. Increasingly, there is a shift away from traditional approaches to more complex funding instruments. These new in - struments incorporate all three levels in project-based, problem-orientated research. There is a trend towards more cluster-oriented policy to foster spatial concentration and networking effects by incorporating partners from universities, public research institutes, and the private sector.76 For example, at a project level the Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resis - tance (JPIAMR)77 aims at coordinating research on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the EU plus Israel and Canada and has a strategic research agenda (2014) that provides a framework for future investment and research priorities. At an individual level, direct support to individuals include the United State's National Institute of Health (NIH) direc - tors program (career-establishment grants)78 ac - tions (MSCA)79 (fellowships) and the Nobel Prize for Medicine (a recognition prize). Main advantages Main challenges +Funding can be specifically targeted to overcome particular technical challenges/ priorities +Lowers barriers to developer entry, facilitating participation of diverse developers Sponsor bares all (or most) of the cost and risk, as a large amount of the funding may not facilitate later product development Problems with transparency and information asymmetries can inhibit access to, and quality of the resulting knowledge Dependent upon changing public research priorities Research Prizes and Tournaments Examples of specific tools: optional reward system, milestone prizes, best entry tourna - ments. Research prizes can be designed to stimulate competitive, outcomes-based solutions. Priz- es can be helpful to encourage smaller developers and to overcome specific, technical challenges. There is a huge heterogeneity of designs, but main types include milestone prizes that reward researchers for reaching certain milestones and best-entry tourna - ments that reward those achieving the most progress toward a specified research goal by a specified date. Other options include rewards that enable researchers to choose be - tween a monetary prize and a patent.80 75 Towards new business models for R&D for novel antibiotics.

Research and Development DatabasesExamples of specific tools: open-access platforms, data exchange portals. Open access and data exchange aim to foster innovation by increasing the efficiency of research and removing barriers to knowledge access, participation, and generation. Very few tools and very little knowledge generated from basic research are currently in the public domain. Knowledge generation can figure a proprietary (private ownership) na - ture, even at \"precompetitive\" development phases. The ability of these platforms to in - crease transparency and reduce a duplication of efforts is garnering increasing attention. For example, the WHO Global Observatory on Health Research and Development\u2014a platform collating information on health research and development (R&D), identifying gaps and opportunities for health R&D, and helping to define priorities for new R&D in - vestments based on public health needs, especially in emerging countries.82 Other exam - ples are InnoCentive83 a crowdsourcing platform for innovative solutions. The open ac - cess, peer-reviewed Public Library of Science (PLOS84), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP),85 or the European Clinical Trials Database (Eudra CT),86 as well as the Open Source Drug Discovery Initiative (OSDD87) in India. Expert Networks Examples of specific tools: bridging organizations, expert networks. Expert networks aim at increasing the efficiency of research by removing barriers be - tween different experts. They can support in gathering knowledge in specific areas. These networks can engage members of a research community and increase cohesive - ness and effectiveness. Enterprise Financing Examples of specific tools: angel financing, venture capital, risk-sharing instruments, guaranteed loans, refundable tax credits. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have much smaller capital reserves than large pharmaceutical companies and smaller portfolio's across which they can spread their risks. 88 Innovative financing tools for small and medium-sized enterprises are in - creasingly common as countries try to boost their knowledge and innovation economies and acknowledge the role small and medium-sized enterprises can play in addressing so - cietal challenges. For example, the European Investment Bank (EIB)89 and the European Investment Fund (EIF) in cooperation with the European Commission's Horizon 2020 have three relevant Main advantages Main challenges +Enables recouping of investment costs earlier and increases participation of smaller developers +Attracts those who feel they have a competitive advantage +Attracts public and community attention to the cause and rewards active research community members +Overcomes the pitfalls of information asymmetries Potentially rewarding research that never reaches market Risk of collusion between participants Confidentiality concerns could deter those with breakthrough leadsMain advantages Main challenges +Increases efficiency of knowledge generation and dissemination +Reduces costs and wasteful duplication of research Relies on goodwill of participants (proprietary culture may inhibit submission of most valuable information) Problems with transparency and informational asymmetries can inhibit access to and quality of the resulting knowledge Main advantages Main challenges +Increases efficiency of knowledge generation and dissemination +Removes barriers to participation and collaboration, beyond traditional players +Can be used as a tool to keep formerly active researchers involved in the cause Relies on goodwill of participants Success dependent upon specific and continuous engagement of the members of expert networks 81 Life sciences breakthrough prize.

Mossialos, Morel, Edwards et al., 2010. 89 About EIB. European Investment Bank (EIB).The Boston Consulting Group 39 38 Breaking through the Wallfinancing streams available through their joint initiative \"InnovFin-EU Finance for Inno - vators\". The three streams include SME venture capital, SME guarantor, and InnovFin In - fectious Diseases\u2014the latter being aimed specifically at financing \u20ac7.5-75 million for the clinical validation of AMR-related technologies.90 Similar programs can be found in the United States and in some countries at national level. Recommended Levers for Basic Research and Preclinical Development Due to the interlinked nature of the challenges identified in these steps, levers for the first two phases of the value chain were considered together. The following challenges were identified in chapter 3: \"Discovery Void\" in basic research \"Valley of death\" in preclinical development Results of evaluation The following levers were identified to be the most effective to combat these challenges. Defining Target Product Profiles allows for a strategic and focused agenda for develop - ing antibiotics most urgently needed from a global health perspective. The careful specification of Target Product Profiles will be essential to the success of an effective comprehensive antibiotics strategy. Providing additional sources of research funding is essential to increasing research activity in antibiotics. Without direct financial support, the challenges in basic research and preclinical development are unlikely to be resolved. In order to spark research activi - ty, a significant investment is likely to be necessary. Funding for basic research should seek to support individual, promising projects via direct financing and lighthouse institu - tions via enterprise financing and institutional financing. A research and development database will be needed to facilitate a strategic funding approach and to avoid duplication of efforts. An expert network can slow down the brain drain currently underway in the field of antibiotics and support a turnaround. It can provide valuable input into ongoing research and development efforts. Finally, a research prize can inspire members of the research community and serve as a visible sign of a new dynamic in the field. The research prize will also increase the prestige associated with antibiotics research.4.2 Incentives Primarily Targeting Clinical Development Tax Incentives Examples of specific tools: tax deferrals, tax allowances, tax credits, refundable tax credits. Tax incentives for research and development (R&D) can be in the form of adjustments to taxable income (deductions), lower tax rates, and adjustments to tax payments (tax cred - its). Enhanced deductions over 100% are referred to as allowances and a deferral is a tax liability that can be carried forward to a future point in time. For example, the USA's 1983 Orphan Drug Tax Credit (ODTC) and the UK's Vaccine Re - search Relief Programme91. The ODTC allows developers to claim a tax credit for up to 50% of qualified PI-III clinical testing expenses.92 The UK Vaccine Research Relief allows for a further 40% reduction against corporation tax for relevant R&D cost. Product Development Partnerships (PDPs) and Other Public Private Research Collaborations Examples of specific tools: PDPs, multidisciplinary engagement initiatives, research excel - lence initiatives (REI's). Partnerships that combine different skills and resources from multiple sectors have been used to address research or development challenges in other areas. Independent legal en - tities have been formed to address disease-specific challenges. They attract funding, man- age the R&D process (potentially including intellectual property management) and facili - tate collaborative working. PDPs became a frequent model in the last 15 years to address specific product needs for patients in the developing world. They lower the cost of devel - opment through more efficient use of resources by pulling in expertise only as it is re - quired at each step or through securing pro bono expert input. For example, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) is one of the earliest (in - ception in 2003) and is currently advocating the creation of an antibiotic-specific product development partnership (PDP)93, a proposal echoed many times but also by Chatham House's Global Antibiotic PDP (GAPPP). Some PDPs operate at national level such as the USA's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). BARDA pro - vides an integrated, systematic approach to the development and purchase of the necessary vaccines, drugs, therapies, and diagnostic tools for public health medical emergencies.94 In Main advantages Main challenges +Maximizes participation by all developers +Relatively small sums can make a difference Sponsor bares some/all of the risk Challenges in identifying promising SMEs/ideas to finance based off limited early-stage data Main advantages Main challenges +More flexible than grants; priorities and approach remain in the hands of the developers Incentive tied to the country where the R&D conducted Little evidence of cost effectiveness relative to alternatives 91 UK Research and Development Tax Relief https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/192107/ randd_tax_relief.pdf 92 Impact of the Orphan Drug Tax Credit on Treatments for Rare Diseases.

InnovFin - EU Finance for Innovators is a joint initiative by the EIB Group and the European Commission under Horizon 2020. The Boston Consulting Group 41 40 Breaking through the Wallthe EU\u2014although frequently global in its collaboration\u2014the Innovative Medicines Initia - tive (IMI) has a number of initiatives under the New Drugs for Bad Bugs (ND4BB) program but only some are directed specifically at product development95. Simplifying Clinical Trial Requirements For example: changing trial requirement guidelines. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recently changed its guidelines for clinical antibiotic trials to facilitate patient recruitment, enable organism-specific (rather than disease-specific) studies, and accept smaller studies.96 Additionally, it has developed \"adaptive pathways\", whereby the authorization starts with one indication (most likely a \"niche\" indication) for a given drug, and through iterative phases of evidence gathering the licensing may be widened to potential further therapeutic uses.97 The FDA is also considering and implementing more flexible arrangements specifically for antibiotic ap - provals. Despite these recent changes, the clinical trial phases remain costly and risky for developers. Therefore, streamlining this phase of the process could make antibiotics more attractive to developers.Clinical Trial Platform FFor example: developing clinical trial platform. Clinical trials regarding antibiotics face the challenge of recruiting patients. Trial platform indirectly reduce the time and financial investments necessary by facilitating the recruit - ment of patients and clinical trials. Recommended Levers for Clinical Development The following major challenge was identified in chapter 3: High cost in clinical development and difficult patient recruitment Results of Evaluation The following levers were identified to be the most effective to combat these challenges. Product development partnerships (PDPs) can provide valuable support for compa - nies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with promising antibiotic candidates. Companies owning a suitable antibiotic candidate would be supported finan - cially and with expert advice during the costly clinical development - and potentially also during marketing of the medicine. An clinical trial platform for antibiotics could help facilitate clinical trials and address a major issue along the value chain: the challenge of recruiting sufficient numbers of suitable patients. The platform could include all ongoing clinical trials, relevant hospitals and clinics, which are likely to be able to include potential trial participants. Establishing a database for trials patients can participate in, would furthermore support surveillance efforts. 4.3 Incentives Targeting Market Approval Expedited Market ApprovalExamples of specific tools: special designation, expedited/priority review, and regulatory harmonization. Regulatory agencies such as the EMA and FDA approve pharmaceuticals in their respec - tive geographies. For a \"global antibiotic\", a developer would need to secure approval in many different countries (or groups of countries such as the EU). Although the require - ments are broadly similar, they vary in detail among differing jurisdictions. On a national or regional level, priority antibiotics could receive a special designation making them eli - gible for some form of expedited regulatory review. Both the EMA and FDA have four such designations. The FDA has a specified antibiotic designation.95 The Innovative Medicines Initiative. Innovative medicines initiative. The Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) is Europe's largest public-private initiative. The program is based on a collaborative approach engaging public, academic and private institutions in joint research projects. Among other goals it seeks to develop effective treatments against gram-negative bacteria. 96 Antibiotic resistance-the need for global solutions. Laxminarayan R, Duse A, Wattal C, et al. 2013. 97 Adaptive pathways. European Medicines Agency.Main advantages Main challenges +Appeal to both large (when market too small or risky) and small (lower costs) developers +Potentially easier to align with public health goals (access considerations often a precondition for participation) +High efficiency of development process Managing different objectives of different partners (especially with respect to IP rights) Risk and cost is spread between developers (but sponsor takes on most) Challenges with monitoring and accountability Main advantages Main challenges +Reduced time for antibiotic to reach market at significantly lower developer costs Lower trial requirements increase risk for insufficient patient safety and efficacy of antibioticsMain advantages Main challenges +Reduces time for antibiotic to reach market at lower developer costs +Decreases barriers to non-pharmaceutical industry participation Data protection of participants needs to be carefully implementedThe Boston Consulting Group 43 42 Breaking through the WallFor example, Qualified Infectious Disease Products (QIDP) in the USA is the first jurisdic - tion to have an antibiotic-specific expedited review pathway, approving four new antibi - otics this way in 2014. A drug that receives QIDP designation is eligible under the statute for fast track designation and priority review.98 Alignment of Regulatory Processes On a global level, alignment (or some level of mutual recognition) between jurisdictions would ensure priority antibiotics were most rapidly available to patients, lessen the ad - ministrative burden on developers, and enable developers to capitalize more effectively on the patent term. For example, since 1990 the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Re - quirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) has brought togeth - er developers and regulatory agencies from the USA, Japan, and Europe to work on this issue.99 Transferable Approval and Market Privileges Example of specific tools: wildcard patent extensions, transferable regulatory reviews, and vouchers. By making the privileges of expedited review or prolonged patent protection (see also chapter 4.4) transferable to another drug in a developer's portfolio (partial) or even an - other company (full\u2014via a sale), the incentive can be greatly strengthened and advantag - es broadened.For example, legislation exists in the USA for wildcard priority review vouchers (PRV) for developers of treatments for neglected (2008) or rare pediatric (2014) diseases. For the latter the \"pediatric PRV\" was created by section 908 of the 2012 FDA Safety and Innova - tion Act (\"FDASIA\") the most recently rewarded PRV was sold for $245 million by the company Retrophin to Sanofi.100 Recommended Levers for Market Approval The following major challenge was identified in chapter 3: Insufficient alignment between leading agencies worldwide in market approval Results of Evaluation The following levers were identified to be the most effective to address these challenges. A further alignment of approval processes for antibiotics across major regulatory agen - cies could build on existing efforts and decrease the necessary investment in financial re - sources and time to develop a new antibiotic.Transferable approval and market privileges provide a potentially attractive financing mechanism for the levers recommended in this report. 4.4 Incentives Targeting Commercialization Adaptations to Product Reimbursement Mechanisms Examples of specific tools: reimbursement top-ups/add-on payments, conditional reim - bursement, pay-for-performance (P4P). Higher or broader reimbursement increases the commercial attractiveness of a given market. Payers have used conditional reimbursement or pay-for-performance agreements to reimburse products while additional evidence on the value of the product is still being gathered. In the case of antibiotics, it has to be noted that a more generous reimburse - ment may facilitate overuse and/or misuse. For example, the United States has experience implementing add-on payments for select - ed new technologies (50% over the DRG) through Medicare's New Technology Add-on Main advantages Main challenges +Products are available to patients faster (public health gain) +Increased revenues to developer as effective patent-life extended Could potentially compromise patient safety only if used in conjunction with simplified requirements Maybe of limited/insufficient financial value to the developer May require increasing resources/staffing for regulatory agencies Main advantages Main challenges +Promotes quicker access to needed antibiotics +Reduce resources (time and money) required for antibiotic development and approval for both developer and payer Regulatory systems subject to different national/regional interests Limited advantages for antibiotics because \"low-hanging fruits\" already imple- mented and cooperation already advanced in most areas 100 Regulatory Explainer: Everything You Need to Know About FDA's Priority Review Vouchers. Gaffney and Mezher, 2015. Main advantages Main challenges +Off-budget, i.e., payers incur no direct costs +Potentially strong incentive (ability to monetize them, pull-in blockbuster returns, issue multiple vouchers) +Transfers attractiveness of other therapeutic areas to field of antibiotics Distorts market signals by attaching an award to an unrelated drug Would be an uncertain and nontransparent economic benefit to developers Potentially large social costs from market distortion in other therapeutic areas 98 Guidance for Industry.

Adaptations to the Current Intellectual Property System (I): Broadening Patent Protection Examples of specific tools: broadening or extending patent protection. Two adaptations to the existing intellectual property (IP) system have been proposed: broadening patents so they cover whole resistance groups (known as functional resis - tance groups (FRG) or extending the patent duration.102 For the former, increasing the breadth of patents in this way would dampen the incentives for marketing (internalizing the costs of resistance). Broad patents could stop companies competing for the same pool of effectiveness within a functional resistance group, but maintain incentives for develop - ers outside of the patented classes. For example, academic proposal put forward by by Prof. Ramanan Laxminarayan103 not yet implemented.Adaptations to the Current Intellectual Property System (II): Extended Patent Protection Extending the patent protection period and/or strengthening data exclusivity provisions would delay the entry of lower-cost generic competitors and increase the profitability of the product for the originator. Besides the profitability aspect, it is much debated if this would increase or decrease 104 the development of resistance. While an increase can result from deterring the follow-on products and further stifling innovation, a decrease might be due to reducing incentives for marketing. For example, dalbavancin (Dalvance\u00ae) an antibacterial drug used to treat adults with skin infections approval by the FDA in 2014 received an additional 5 years of exclusivity (2-3 years effectively), until 2024 as opposed to 2019, as part of the US Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act. Dalvance\u00ae is the first drug designated as a Qualified Infec - tious Disease Product (QIDP) to receive FDA approval.105 Delinkage ModelsExamples of specific tools: advanced market commitments, patent buyouts Incentives to stimulate research and development (R&D) for antibiotics that involve un - coupling the developers' return on investments (RoI) from the volume of antibiotics sold on the market are referred to as delinkage models. Delinkage models usually comprise value-based lump sum payments at certain milestones (e.g., market approval). Such mod - els are popular because an increase of antibiotics prizes risks increasing marketing and sales activity, thereby counteracting stewardship efforts. When designing the lump sum payment, a balance between being large enough to at - tract researchers with the necessary skill set while avoiding overpayment that wastes scarce public (or donated) resources has to be found. A number of delinkage models ex - ist, and they are fundamentally based on different ways by which the lump sum payment is calculated. The main ones are listed as follows:Main advantages Main challenges +Feasible within current system\u2014seen as the \"natural incentive\" for R&D into novel/high-priority antibiotics +Increases net present value and revenue certainty for developers +Society pays for what it benefits from and values and reimbursement could be adjusted as antibiotic effectiveness changes Would require a substantial increase in reimbursement rates\u2014perhaps beyond what is feasible Requires an agreement on how to conduct a health technology assessment across countries (or one uniform assessment) Does not delink revenues from sales volume so incentive remains for intense marketing with potential impact on overuse and/or misuse 101 Reinvigorating the Oral Antibacterial Drug Development Pipeline.

Laxminarayan and Malani argue that resistance might accelerate a few years before the exhaustion of IP protection as companies have an incentive to maximize sales before the arrival of generic competition, otherwise known as patent holder waste. 105 Press release: FDA approves Dalvance to treat skin infections.

Could exacerbate resistance by stifling further innovation beyond the first mover, deterring follow-on products and promoting over - utilization for a longer periodThe Boston Consulting Group 47 46 Breaking through the Wall Prize funds: An umbrella term for a lump sum reward to developers of a successful new antibiotic, in exchange to forgo their intellectual property rights. The size of the prize can be determined by estimating what the market value might have been, what the private value is (auction), or a calculation of the social value (using health econo - metrics or the Health Impact Fund (HIF) proposal). For example, three prizes targeting antimicrobial diagnostics were announced in 2015, the UK's \u20ac14 million Longitude Prize106, the EU \u20ac1 million Horizon Prize107, and the United States \u20ac18 million prize from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)108. Advanced market commitments (AMCs): A type of purchase guarantee scheme, whereby a third-party agrees to subsidize the purchase of an antibiotic at a pre-agreed price and volume. For example, currently being piloted for GlaxoSmithKline's/Pfizer's pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI). License agreements based on social value: Upfront contracts drawn up between public bodies (payers) and private developers (company) to agree on an upfront lump sum payment for a newly developed innovative antibiotic without further unit pay - ments on market release. When designing delinkage levers, the ownership of intellectual property (IP) needs to be considered as well. Depending on the design of the delinkage model, the intellectual property could either remain with the developer or be transferred to a public body (pat - ent buy-out). A coordinating mechanism that aggregates licensing agreements or patent rights is a patent pool. This mechanism enables collective acquisition and management of intellectual property for use by third parties.Partial Delinkage ModelsIn partial delinkage models, patent holders retain their intellectual property rights (IP) over the new antibiotic. They can manufacture, sell, and distribute the products as normal or agree on licencing agreements; two such concepts reoccur in the literature. The first in - volves licensing the intellectual property rights to a public body, which pays a (reduced) lump sum in exchange for the company agreeing to supply the product on defined markets at marginal costs. The second involves companies receiving a full reward and then reim - bursing the sponsor with a share of profit from sales. The latter model has recently been proposed by the Jim O'Neill review and is similar to Rempex Pharmaceuticals Rewarding Antibiotic Development and Responsible Stewardship (RADARS) proposal. For example, Rempex Pharmaceuticals has proposed the RADARS model whereby a pub- lic body guarantees to purchase a product for 5 years. Under this model, a revenue guar - antee would climb each year as per-patient pricing would fall. Any discrepancy between hospital reimbursement would be fulfilled by guarantor (US Department of Health and Human Services/ HHS). The prize is reduced by company sales invoices. It includes eligi - bility criteria and conditional ties for patient, hospital, and innovator.109 Recommended Levers for Commercialization The following major challenge was identified in chapter 3: Low market attractiveness in commercialization Results of evaluation The following levers were identified to be the most effective to combat this challenge. We propose a partial delinkage model which bases the reward for an innovative antibi - otic on value for public health. This partial delinkage would be designed as a \"market en - try reward\" (detailled in chapter 5), which companies can receive upon approval of the product. Under the proposed model, the developer would still possess the intellectual property rights. The recipient of the market entry reward must agree to a profit sharing agreement with the sponsor to receive the reward.In addition to the market entry rewards, selective adaptations to the reimbursement of antibiotics in the hospital setting could be made (detailed in chapter 5). Reimbursement of innovative antibiotics in the hospital should compensate for only the marginal costs arising from the use of those innovative antibiotics, so that hospitals have no incentives regarding overuse or misuse of certain high-priced antibiotics. Potential Financing OptionsSome, even though not all, of the levers discussed above will require - partially substan - tial - additional financial resources. Many proposals exist how the additional resources could be raised: National-contribution on a voluntary or legally-mandated basis, normally proposed as a % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) For example, as proposed in Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund), Medical R&D Treaty110 106 Longitude Prize 2014-2019.

For example, Corporate Bond Funding Model114 Merging of existing (national-level) funds - creation of a global fund This report recommends implementing a set of 10 levers that address the mul - tiple challenges along the value chain. While the levers are designed to work to - gether as a package, they do not all have to be implemented at the same time. The complexity of the existing challenges requires a multipronged approach (figure 22). The recommendations made in this chapter were validated with players from the sci - entific and research community, the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, as well as health and regulatory organizations. In our view, the most important and effective levers are additional funding for basic re - search, Partnerships in Clinical Development, and a market entry reward for new, innova- tive antibiotics, i.e., a volume-independent reward for companies launching a novel anti - biotic that is effective against one or more of the most urgent bacterial threats\u2014as defined by a list of Target Product Profiles.5.

The Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Big Innovation Centre, 2015.The Boston Consulting Group 51 50 Breaking through the Wall Financing Recommended Levers and Contribution of the Pharmaceutical Industry Significant financial resources will be required in order to implement the recommended le - vers. In addition to funding from states, public entities and donors, we recommend having the pharmaceutical industry participate in financing these measures. The pharmaceutical industry has benefitted and benefits from the use of antibiotics in both humans and ani - mals that inevitably leads to the development of resistance. Therefore, it is only logical to ask the pharmaceutical industry to contribute to the financing of levers that will ensure a sustainable supply of new antibiotics. The following models should be considered: Contribution based on antibiotics sales: The worldwide antibiotics market is esti - mated at around \u20ac40 billion. A sales-based contribution of up to 5% of sales could pro- vide significant resources to fund activities in antibiotics research and development. This way, companies benefiting from the sale of antibiotics would contribute to the development of new and innovative antibiotics. Such a contribution could be limited to animal health antibiotics and would also have the additional effect of deterring ir - responsible use. Alternatively, such a contribution could be limited to companies that are not active in the research and development of new antibiotics. Profit-sharing mechanism: In cases where funding is provided for profit-oriented ac - tivities (for example late-stage clinical development) profit-sharing agreements should be used to at least partially recoup the investments made. These profit-sharing agree - ments would be based on the sales revenue generated from the antibiotics in ques - tion. Usually, the sponsor would receive a fixed percentage of profits (or revenues) over the entire lifecycle of the product. Alternative funding sources: A range of alternative sources of funding could be con - sidered. One such source is the sale of transferable priority review vouchers (PRVs) that are already awarded in the area of neglected tropical diseases.115 PRVs have achieved prices of \u20ac220-320 million when sold on the open market. Regulatory ap - proval agencies such as the EMA or FDA could alternate in selling such vouchers. This could create significant funds without placing a financial burden on governments or international organizations. Nevertheless, it should be noted that indirect societal costs (namely higher health care expenditure) can be incurred by this instrument, as it potentially distorts other pharmaceutical markets. As shown in figure 22, each of the 10 recommended levers will have an impact on in dif - ferent phases along the value chain. 5.1 Definition of Target Product Profiles (TPP) 5.1.1 Objectives In order to steer research and development (R&D) toward the areas with the highest pub - lic health need, we recommend developing Target Product Profiles for the most urgently needed antibiotics. Such a definition will help all following levers to guide R&D efforts into areas of highest need. For example, the Target Product Profiles will be used to assess the value and innovativeness of an antibiotic that qualifies for the market entry reward (see chapter 5.9). 5.1.2 Proposed Approach The Target Product Profiles would be based on a classification of pathogens by threat level. National efforts have already been undertaken to classify bacterial threats and could serve as a basis for the development of global Target Product Profiles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for example, has developed a list of the most urgent microbial threats in the United States (see chapter 2.2.1). 5.1.3 Targeted Stakeholders This lever will require the participation of the following stakeholders: National health ministries and agencies: National public bodies can help finding the most urgent areas of R&D. Including public agencies from developed and devel - oping countries will help to create a comprehensive list of Target Product Profiles. Researchers from science and industry: It is essential to engage the scientific and research community to include topic experts in the definition process for the Target Product Profiles. Non-governmental organizations: Non-governmental organizations have proved successful in attracting attention to previously unattractive areas of research. Their expertise and support can increase the likelihood of a widely accepted list of Target Product Profiles 5.1.4 Financial Implications The list of TPPs will serve as a guiding instrument for the other levers recommended in this report. A participatory process of identifying the most urgent global threats needs to include stakeholders from all fields. Direct funding necessary for this lever is limited to the cost of coordination of the participating stakeholders. 5.2 Global Antibiotics Research Fund 5.2.1 Objectives The aim of a research fund is to substantially increase activity in basic research and pre - clinical development through project-based and institutional funding of academic institu - tions and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Basic research is often pre-compet - itive and dependent on funding by public actors, this is also true for antibiotics. Establishing a fund will signal long-term commitment to potential reasearchers. This will be important to enhance the activities in basic research and pre-clinical development. While there are already several initiatives on national or supra-national level, we recom - mend bundling these efforts in a global fund. The global antibiotics research fund will address two of the major challenges: \"Discovery void\" in basic research \"Valley of death\" in preclinical development 115 United Therapeutics Sells Priority-Review Voucher to AbbVie for $350 Million. The Wall Street Journal. http://www.wsj.com/articles/ united-therapeutics-sells-priority-review-voucher-to-abbvie-for-350-million-1439981104, accessed 23 September 2015The Boston Consulting Group 53 52 Breaking through the Wall 5.2.2 Proposed Approach Defining a Strategic Focus Following a strategic research agenda informed by the Target Product Profiles (lever 1), the research fund will support research projects of academic institutions and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with a focus on the biggest challenges in antibacterial research. From today's perspective, these challenges could be: Advancing the understanding of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria and iden - tifying new compounds active against them Promoting the development of point-of-care diagnostic tools Additionally, the fund should selectively invest into blue sky research(the exploration of new and innovative research fields) that has the potential to open completely new avenues for antibacterial research Funding Public and Private Entities Funding will be available for research institutions and for small and medium-sized enter - prises (enterprise funding). Interested parties can apply for funding on a project basis. Project funding can run for multiple years, depending on the nature of the projects. How- ever, project progress will be tracked on a regular basis. The application process will be peer-reviewed by experts from the field. The financial support will be structured differ - ently for basic research and preclinical development: Basic research: Supported organizations will receive grants which do not have to be repaid as projects in this precompetitive phase rarely generate revenues. Research in - stitutions may furthermore apply for longer term institutional funding for PhD, post-doctoral positions or professorships. These mid- to long-term funding agreements are intended to create certainty and stability for antibiotics research and to allow for the institutionalization of knowledge. Preclinical development: In preclinical development, the opportunities of develop - ing results with commercial value are already higher than in basic research. There- fore, as a condition for receiving a grant, the fund will put in place profit-sharing agreements with the institutions. These agreements require recipients to share a cer - tain percentage of the resulting profits with the fund. If no profits are generated, the recipients have no financial obligations to the fund. The fund will seek to achieve an equivalent internal rate of return with the funded private entity. Entities receiving funding are encouraged to share the results and data of funded projects with the research community (see lever 4 below). 5.2.3 Targeted Stakeholders The following stakeholders will be eligible for funding from the global antibiotics re - search fund: Academic institutions: These institutions should be encouraged to apply for funding in both basic and preclinical development. Small and medium-sized enterprises: As big pharmaceutical companies have large - ly withdrawn from this phase in the value chain, it is essential to encourage other commercial actors to continue and increase participation. Additionally, these smaller companies are more agile and able to change strategy in light of such funding opportunities. 5.2.4 Financial Implications In order to turn around the decline in antibiotics research activity and to tackle the exist - ing scientific challenges, significant funds will have to be provided. We estimate that total funding has to amount to a similar order of magnitude as the New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB)116 program (around \u20ac100 million per year). The fund could be financed by the public, by the contributions of the pharmaceutical industry (as discussed above) and with potential proceeds from profit-sharing agreements reached with participating entities. 5.3 Global Antibiotics Research Prize 5.3.1 Objectives The prize will attract public attention to current challenges in antibiotics research. The prize will increase the visibility associated with antibacterial research and also create a platform for exchange among researchers. The public attention drawn by similar efforts in related areas, such as the UK Longitude Prize, is very high compared to the necessary investment. The announcement of such a price itself can be used to create positive mo - mentum for antibiotics R&D. The global antibiotics research prize will have a positive impact on two major challenges of the value chain: \"Discovery void\" in basic research \"Valley of death\" in preclinical development 5.3.2 Proposed Approach Awarding Innovation in Basic Research Prizes will be awarded to the institution or researcher that presents the most promising or innovative concept regarding an announced theme. The awarded amounts should be in-line with similar research prizes, such as the UK Longitude Prize, which promises \u20ac10 million for a rapid point-of-care diagnostic for bacteria. Research projects from all over the world would be eligible for the prize. To ensure that the prize winners are legitimate, the following requirements have to be met: Studies must be peer-reviewed Relevant data must be made available to ensure transparency Potential First Focus: Gram-Negative Bacteria As discussed before, gram-negative bacteria pose an exceptional challenge to the scientif - ic progress in antibacterial research. Thus, we recommend focusing the first prize on achievements that have the potential to contribute to the development of effective treat - ments against gram-negative bacteria. 116 New Drugs for Bad Bugs. http://www.nd4bb.eu/The Boston Consulting Group 55 54 Breaking through the Wall An Conference as a Platform for Exchange The award will be presented at a conference focusing on antibiotics. The conference will serve as a forum for exchange and community building for active researchers and experts in the field. The price will be awarded every 5 years. The conference, however, will serve as a yearly opportunity to network and advance R&D in antibiotics. 5.3.3 Targeted Stakeholders Academic institutions conducting research on antibiotics are invited to compete for the prize. Beyond such research institutions, other stakeholders will also benefit from the re - search prize: Active and former researchers: The prize is expected to facilitate communication about research and knowledge concerning bacteria and antibiotics. The wider public: The prize is intended to attract attention to the cause of antibiot - ics research. Attracting journalists or interested citizens to the yearly conference will further increase the reach of the lever. Sponsors: The prize and the yearly conference are suitable sponsorship opportuni - ties. Pharmaceutical companies or charitable organizations can play active roles in the organization of the research prize. 5.3.4 Financial Implications The required investment for the global antibiotics price is estimated as follows: One-time establishment costs: approximately \u20ac1 million Total prize money (every 5 years): approximately \u20ac13 million Funds required for yearly conference: approximately \u20ac1 million The estimations are based on comparable events and their required budgets. 5.4 Antibiotics Research and Development Database 5.4.1 Objectives We recommend creating a database that will serve as a central information repository for researchers in the field of antibiotics. The database will bundle information on past and ongoing research projects from academia and commercial players. Allowing access to re - search results would be a condition for receiving financial support of any kind, e.g., from the research fund. The database will help improve the allocation of research efforts and funds through more informed decision making. It will also facilitate the exchange of ideas between research - ers working on similar problems. The antibiotics research and development database will have a positive impact on two major challenges: \"Discovery void\" in basic research \"Valley of death\" in preclinical development 5.4.2 Proposed Approach Scope of the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Database The database will have multiple functions which can be used by active researchers, poli- cy makers and experts in antibiotics: Increased access to existing studies/research projects Increased ability to identify and communicate with relevant researchers in the field Beyond Peer-Reviewed ArticlesEssential knowledge about the behavior of bacteria and the mechanisms of antibacterial agents resides with different players in the field. It is important to engage these players to share project insights through the database. This includes information from past and cur - rent projects, successful as well as failed, as these are equally important to improving co - ordination and communication. Motivating Open Sharing of Information Achieving participation from all parties actively involved in antibiotics research is chal - lenging. Especially pharmaceutical companies have had little motivation to share infor - mation on their antibiotics programs. However, recent efforts to enhance transparency (e.g., opening up compound libraries by big pharmaceutical institutions) have been in - creasingly successful and show that given sufficient positive public attention, the release of noncompetitive information can become attractive for pharmaceutical companies. Companies which have exited antibiotics research may be more likely to share informa - tion because there is no immediate risk of a competitive disadvantage. Parties that actively share information could be rewarded with privileged access to the database. Clear guardrails for the treatment of intellectual property (IP) will have to be agreed upon with all participating stakeholders to ensure that the most valuable informa - tion is disclosed. 5.4.3 Targeted Stakeholders The following stakeholders will have to be successfully engaged to establish a compre - hensive and effective database: Academic institutions: These institutions should be encouraged to provide both peer reviewed studies and information on current research projects. Pharmaceutical companies: Often relevant research projects were conducted 10-15 years ago, when the commercial field was more active (see chapter 2.1.3). This knowledge is often not shared with the public or the scientific community at risk of being lost per - manently, as research units are continuously being shut down. Achieving access to these studies will be challenging but critical for the success and usefulness of the database. Scientific journals: Targeting scientific journals directly can increase the comprehen - siveness of the database. Creating a central repository for relevant information will re - quire an active engagement with the scientific publishing community. 5.4.4 Financial Implications Integration with Current EffortsThe database should seek to coordinate with current efforts already under way. In Eu - rope, a project within the New Drugs for Bad Bugs (ND4BB) initiative has started to com - pile studies to improve decision making.117 Other efforts around the world should be con - sidered as cooperation partners as well. 117 COMPACTE Program. Innovative Medicines Initiative.The Boston Consulting Group 57 56 Breaking through the Wall The required investment for the global antibiotics R&D database could be in the follow - ing range (estimations based on expert interviews): One-time establishment costs: approximately \u20ac1-2 million Yearly running cost: Less than \u20ac1 million The necessary investment for the establishment will vary substantially depending on the setup (independent or as part of existing structures) and the functions that the database will include. 5.5 Global Antibiotics Expert Network 5.5.1 Objectives Addressing Current Inefficiencies in the Antibiotics Research and Development CommunityWe recommend establishing a network of antibiotics experts in order to preserve existing knowledge and support research and development projects. Identifying these experts and securing their future support can significantly improve the chances of success for antibiotic research and development. The members of the expert network would advise research projects (in particular those funded by the research fund) and partnerships for clinical development, based on their extensive experience in the field. This is essential in addressing the challenges: \"Discovery void\" in basic research \"Valley of death\" in preclinical development 5.5.2 Proposed Approach Strengthening Connections within the Antibiotics R&D Community The network would include active researchers but also former members of the antibiot - ics community who used to work in the field but have ended their active engagement in antibiotics research. The expert network will also play a crucial role in supporting the other levers described in this chapter, especially the research prize (by serving as a panel selecting the winning entries), partnerships for clinical development (by providing expert advice) and the re - search fund (by evaluating and supporting research projects). The network is intended as a targeted approach to identify and connect the leading ac - tive and former researchers. The members will form a panel, which could be approached when scientific advice is required. Specifying Interaction Formats The success of an expert network relies on regular in-person communication, which helps maintain a significant level of activity and productivity. This could be achieved through the following formats: Regular network events (such as the global antibiotic research prize and conference) Use of the expertise in allocating funding in basic research and preclinical develop - ment Placement of the experts as advisors on funded research and development projects5.5.3 Targeted Stakeholders The following stakeholders will have to be engaged to identify leading active and retired researchers and establish an effective global antibiotics expert network: Academic institutions: A significant part of basic research in antibiotics and related fields is conducted in academic settings. Institutions and individuals should be en - gaged to provide information on relevant researchers for the expert network. Pharmaceutical companies: A large part of basic research and preclinical develop - ment was conducted in the industrial setting. These organizations need to be engaged to provide details and serve as an introducer to active and retired researchers. Practitioners with relevant expertise: In order to advise scientists on topics that are high - ly relevant for patient care, the consideration of practical expertise associated with anti - biotics research and development (R&D) is important. Multiple fields of expertise should be engaged to establish a comprehensive panel of researchers. These fields include pharmacology, microbiology, medicinal chemistry and others. 5.5.4 Financial Implications The required investment for the global antibiotics expert network could be in the follow - ing range (based on expert interviews): One-time establishment costs: approximately \u20ac1-2 million Yearly maintenance: less than \u20ac500,000 5.6 Partnerships in Clinical Development 5.6.1 Objectives We recommend establishing partnerships in clinical development for promising antibiot - ics that meet one (or several) of the Target Product Profiles (see chapter 5.1). Partner- ships in clinical development will help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and research institutions in conducting clinical trials. Although relatively low compared to other therapeutic areas, costs for clinical trials of anti - biotics are still significant (around \u20ac120 million for the clinical development of an antibiot - ic, see chapter 3.2.1) and potentially prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises. Providing SMEs with financial and non-financial support (e.g., expert advice through the expert network) at this stage could increase the number of antibiotics in clinical trials.The Partnerships in Clinical Development will address one of the major identified chal - lenges: High cost in clinical development 5.6.2 Proposed Approach Supporting Clinical Development To foster increased activity in clinical development of antibiotics, partnerships in clinical development will be established. The partnerships will provide support along the clinical The Boston Consulting Group 59 58 Breaking through the Wall development. Companies and research institutions can apply for support of clinical trials for promising candidates. Providing Support Until Market Approval Partnerships in clinical development can be formed for each phase of clinical develop - ment. If a clinical trial phase is successfully passed, funding for the next clinical phase is not automatically granted. Interested parties must apply for funding for each clinical phase. This is intended to ensure that the most promising candidates with the largest po - tential for societal benefit are identified and funded at each step. Providing Financial and Organizational Support If a candidate is evaluated as suitable, the partnership in clinical development will sup - port the clinical trial in multiple ways: Financial support for the relevant trial phase (can cover up to 50% of the clinical trial costs) In-kind resources (e.g., laboratories and patient databases) Expert advice via the global antibiotic expert network (see chapter 5.4) When small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are funded, the cash flow require - ments of these entities should be taken into consideration (increased reliance on continu - ous provision of funds in smaller increments). Establishing a Profit-Sharing System Companies accepting support must agree to a profit-sharing agreement, which is activat - ed in case of market entry or sale of intellectual property (IP). A fixed part of any profits retained through the sale of the antibiotic or the intellectual property will be used to re - pay the funding support. In case of a substantial contribution of the funding entity, the results of the research (potentially including intellectual property-protected results) could be used to support future research efforts. Focusing on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Only small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and research institutions which are not able to carry the full cost of clinical development are taken into consideration for funding preferentially. Interactions with Market Entry Reward Should a compound that has been developed under a partnership in clinical develop - ment be marketed and qualify for the market entry reward (see chapter 5.9), the finan - cial support received during this clinical trial stage will be deducted from the final mar - ket entry reward payment. 5.6.3 Targeted Stakeholders The following stakeholders will have to be successfully engaged to establish partnerships in clinical development for clinical candidates: SMEs and biotech companies: By focusing the support on small and medium-sized enterprises, additional activity through new players entering clinical development will be fostered. Academic institutions: By engaging academic institutions into these partnerships for clinical development, essential knowledge and research insights can be leveraged.5.6.4 Financial Implications The required investment for the partnerships in clinical Development depends on the amount of studies funded and can be is estimated as follows: Yearly cost (based on the assumption that one trial in each phase starts per year: ap- proximately \u20ac70 million)118 5.7 Global Antibiotics Trial Platform 5.7.1 Objectives We recommend establishing a global platform for antibiotic trials in order to support the planning and execution of clinical trials. The platform would improve the matching of clinical trials and patients, which is especially challenging in acute antibiotic settings that require quick response times. The platform can improve recruiting of patients for phase II and phase III trials, thereby improving the quality and speed of clinical trials while potentially reducing costs for com - panies. The global antibiotics trial platform will address one of the major identified chal - lenges: Difficult patient recruitment and high cost in clinical development 5.7.2 Proposed Approach Setting Up a Platform for Suitable Hospitals This platform would include relevant hospitals and clinics, which are likely to be able to include potential trial participants as they regularly treat patients being infected by bac - teria included in the TPPs (e.g., because they have departments for infectious diseases). These hospitals and clinics would be primarily asked to recruit patients for the clinical trials. Trials of antibiotics that match the criteria of a TPP could be treated preferentially and have privileged access or priority in patient allocation. Setting Up a Reporting Platform for Patients The platform contains information about current and planned clinical trials and the pa - tients these trials are looking for. Hospitals (especially those not part of the platform mentioned above) and doctors would be able to access the platform if patients are inter - ested in participating in such trials. It is essential to ensure the data privacy of potential participants. 5.7.3 Targeted Stakeholders The following stakeholders will have to be successfully engaged to establish a global anti - biotic and patient trial registry: Hospitals: Establishing a stable network of participating hospitals and clinics will be essential for an improved and less resource-intensive clinical development of antibiot - ics. Within the participating clinics, medical personnel from the relevant areas using antibiotics will have to be engaged. Regulatory agencies: The relevant regulatory agencies that define and publish guidelines for clinical trials should be consulted in the design of the platform and the 118 Calculation is based on the given number of clinical trials suggested above. Estimations of clinical trials based on AMR Review.The Boston Consulting Group 61 60 Breaking through the Wall selection of clinics. This ensures that necessary standards are implemented by partici - pants. Surveillance agencies: The clinical trial platform can improve data collection about antibiotic resistance. Such data is valuable for surveillance efforts by public and non-governmental players. Pharmaceutical companies: Pharmaceutical companies should be engaged in the development and set-up of the trial platform to ensure usability in the execution of clinical trials. 5.7.4 Financial Implications Building upon Existing EffortsFor the success of the antibiotics and patient trial registry, it is essential to coordinate with existing databases, such as the COMBACTE CLIN-Net that is currently established in Europe. CLIN-Net aims to support and coordinate clinical trials of antibiotics by develop - ing a network of qualified clinical trial sites. Efforts such as this\u2014currently connecting about 200 hospitals and clinics in Europe\u2014are important steps toward a global trial plat - form that is able to identify patients according to the relevant standards. The necessary initial and continuous funding for such a trial platform depends to a large degree on its mode of establishment (stand-alone or as part of existing efforts). 5.8 Global Alignment of Regulatory Approval Processes 5.8.1 Objectives We recommend continuing to align regulatory requirements for antibiotics across the main markets, building on past and current efforts. Creating a unified global approval process for antibiotics between the EMA, FDA, Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PDMA) and other relevant approval agencies should be considered as the ultimate goal. An increased alignment would have the direct positive effects of lower cost requirements and resource intensity for agencies and approval seekers alike. Furthermore, it could de - crease time-to-market and thereby make new products available earlier. This lever will address one of the major challenges identified: Remaining differences in requirements across regulatory approval agencies in market approval 5.8.2 Proposed Approach Setting Up an Expert Working GroupA working group bringing together representatives of major regulatory agencies (EMA, FDA, PMDA, etc.) should be established to develop specific recommendations on how to further align regulatory requirements (e.g., regarding the use of superiority trials, re - quired statistical analyses, and accepted endpoints). The working group would develop recommendations to align or unify the current approval processes for urgently needed antibiotics. The working group would build on existing efforts by the Transatlantic Task - force on Antimicrobial Resistance (TATFAR), the International Conference on Harmoni - zation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), and others.Guidelines for Aligning Approval ProcessesThe following guidelines should be considered when aligning regulatory requirements: Granting fast-track approval for high priority antibiotics based on the TPP list Harmonizing trial requirements regarding the following aspects (not exhaustive): Possibility of pathogen-specific trials Criteria for patient selection Statistical parameters and standards 5.8.3 Targeted Stakeholders The alignment of approval is a relevant measure for the following players: Regulatory agencies: National and regional are already engaged in active communi - cation to improve the clinical development and clarify market approval requirement for antibiotics. These agencies should be further engaged to continue this process and focus efforts on the TPPs. Existing international working groups: Existing efforts developed through working groups should be used as a starting point for the further alignment of regulatory ap - proval for antibiotics. Companies seeking approval for antibiotics: Seeking the participation of the com - panies will help to identify remaining inefficiencies and uncertainties perceived by the \"users\" of the approval process. 5.8.4 Financial Implications A working group should be set up to define further steps. Beyond that, no direct funding is required for this lever. 5.9 Market Entry Reward for Innovative Antibiotics 5.9.1 Objectives We recommend introducing a market entry reward\u2014a lump-sum payment\u2014paid to companies introducing innovative antibiotics that meet the Target Product Profile (see chapter 5.1). The reward aims to increase the commercial attractiveness of the antibiotics market by providing a reliable and predictable source of income for pharmaceutical com - panies. The market for antibiotics would be changed through the employment of such a partial delinkage model. The return on investment (RoI) for an antibiotic drug would be able to compete with drugs of other therapeutic areas. The lever addresses the following challenge: Low commercial attractiveness in commercialization 5.9.2 Proposed Approach Incentivizing Innovation with a Market Entry RewardThe market entry reward is a fixed and guaranteed payment that is independent of fu - ture sales volume and will be paid to companies introducing an innovative antibiotic that meets the Target Product Profile. Receiving the reward does not entail any transfer of in - tellectual property, i.e., the company launching the drug can still generate returns from selling the product. However, the company has to pay a share of its profits resulting from the sale of the drug back to the sponsor.The Boston Consulting Group 63 62 Breaking through the Wall Antibiotic candidates will be evaluated based on their efficacy against the pathogens pri - oritized in the Target Product Profiles and on their innovativeness (e.g., whether the anti - biotic is part of a new class). Their launch date relative to market competitors should be considered as well: A product that is a fast follower in a new class should receive a finan - cial reward as well, though less than the first-to-market-product. The profit sharing agreements have multiple positive effects: First, the profit sharing revenues replenish the fund, which reduces the financial bur - den on the sponsors of the lever. This way, it is ensured that the fund participates in the potential commercial success of innovative antibiotics while still eliminating the uncertainty that the antibiotic providers face. Second, the profit sharing agreements decrease the incentive to sell the antibiotic, thereby reducing current challenges in conservation for this particular product. By this measure, resistance building could be delayed as well. 5.9.3 Targeted Stakeholders The market entry reward is a relevant measure for the following players: Companies developing and launching antibiotics: The increased expected profit - ability of the innovative antibiotics would create interest from large pharmaceutical companies and have a \"trickle down\" effect, thereby not only supporting companies in the position to produce and sell antibiotic on a large scale, but smaller companies and specialists as well. These companies would benefit as the value of intermediate products (e.g., lead compounds) would increase in anticipation of higher revenues. 5.9.4 Financial Implications Basic Criteria for EligibilityNew antibiotic products would need to fulfill the following criteria to be eligible: Antibiotic suited to the treatment of priority bacteria as defined in the Target Product Profile Market approval by EMA, FDA and potentially other major regulatory agencies Product is first in a new class or alternatively: Provides substantial added value over current antibiotic in the same class Belongs to an existing class but is launched within one year of the first-in- class antibiotic (capped at a combined 100% of the reward for first-in-class and subsequent products) Conditions for Receiving the Market Entry Reward Companies receiving the market entry reward must accept conditions upon receiving the reward. The following aspects must be detailed in such an agreement: Global availability of the antibiotic Affordability of the antibiotic, especially in developing countries If the rewarded product was developed through a development partnership (lever 6), the market entry reward is reduced proportionally Profit-sharing agreements in order to share potential commercial upside with the sponsor of the market entry reward Structure of PaymentsThe reward will be structured in the following way: The market entry reward should be in the order of \u20ac1,000 million There amount could depend on the efficacy against the Target Product Profiles The reward is paid across the first 5 years after launch to ensure product availability Post-approval data on efficacy and safety of the antibiotic should be considered for determining the magnitude of the reward The order of magnitude of around \u20ac1,000 million is required to change the economics an - tibacterial research and was tested with experts in antibiotics R&D and pharmaceutical corporate strategy. This reward would increase the net present value (NPV) significantly as illustrated in figure 23. The net present value of the development of an antibiotic would change from \u20ac-90 million to \u20ac300 million, with a market entry reward of this mag - nitude. 5.10 Reimbursement for Innovative Antibiotics in Hospitals 5.10.1 Objectives We additionally encourage national policy makers to ensure that new antibiotics which meet the Target Product Profile (see chapter 5.1) are adequately reimbursed within the hospital setting, where these antibiotics will be predominately used to minimize inappro - priate usage. This lever will address one of the major identified challenges: Low market attractiveness in commercialization 5.10.2 Proposed Approach Providing a Market In order to create a functioning market for innovative and higher-priced antibiotics, we encourage countries to adequately reimburse innovative antibiotics in a hospital setting.

Figure 24 | Next steps for implementation of levers5.11 Timing and First Steps Many stakeholders interviewed for this report stressed the importance of immediate action in order to address the public health challenge presented by antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The levers presented above constitute a multi- year, coordinated global approach. However, many steps can and have to be taken now. The figure below illustrates a potential high-level timing for the implementation of the levers discussed before.The Boston Consulting Group 67 66 Breaking through the Wall The research and analysis for this report has emphasized the urgency of the im - plementation of some of the levers. Given the accelerating brain drain in antibiot - ics research and the irreversibility of some strategic decisions\u2014e.g., dismantling a re - search unit\u2014delaying implementation might have severe consequences. As explained in previous chapters, the market is currently not providing antibiotics needed to ad - dress the global health challenge. A globally coordinated approach Given the global nature of pharmaceutical research, development and commercializa - tion, and the global challenge of antimicribial resistance, we suggest a globally coordinat - ed approach to implementation. In prior chapters, it has been established that a reinvigoration of the pharmaceutical in - dustry is essential for achieving a sufficient and sustainable supply of antibiotics (see chapter 3). The strategic decision makers of multinational pharmaceutical companies in - terviewed for this report have emphasized that the attractiveness of a therapeutic area is based on global market potential. Individual national efforts can influence these strategic decisions, especially in bigger markets, such as the USA as efforts like the GAIN act have shown. 119 Still, a global, or at least broad international, approach is necessary to change the pharmaceutical industry's engagement in antibiotics. Similarly, an internationally coordinated approach to research in academia is needed. Na- tionally fragmented funding and research agendas have led to a duplication of research efforts and hampered exchange across research groups. We recommend starting with an alliance of influential, opinion-leading countries working closely with multilateral organizations (such as the WHO) and other active stakeholders (such as the DNDi). Other countries as well as philanthropic organizations are encour - aged to join in this initiative. 6.1 Global Antibiotics\u2014Collaboration Platform Creation of the global antibiotics collaboration platform Implementation, coordination, and controlling across initiatives have been a major chal - lenge. We recommend setting up a dedicated, global collaboration platform. Establishing a collaboration platform will help foster the research and development of antibiotics in multiple ways: The collaboration platform can support in the implementation of the different levers. The collaboration platform would signal a strong long-term commitment to partici - pants from the public, private, and academic world. For companies and research insti - tutions to build or maintain these capabilities, security in planning over a multiyear 6. THOUGHTS ON IMPLEMENTATION time horizon is essential. Its establishment would create momentum and be an im - portant start for effectively implementing some of the suggested levers (see below). Broad stakeholder involvement within the global antibiotics collaboration plat - form Given the complexity of the challenges and the breadth of expertise needed, a key suc - cess factor for this collaboration platform is to combine the knowledge of the public and private sector as well as from academia. In other therapeutic areas, e.g., neglected tropi - cal diseases such an approach has been successful. In the case of antibiotics, we suggest setting up an agile and lean collaboration platform employing top-notch personnel from the private and public sector as well as academia. In similar cases, such facilities have been successfully set up as part of public-private partnerships. Scope and vision of the global antibiotics collaboration platform The vision of the collaboration platform can be described along three dimensions: Being a thought leader and coordinator: The platform could raise the profile of an - tibiotics research and serve as a place for fostering innovative ideas, considering un - conventional approaches, and involving players from all sectors. Therefore, in order to identify compounds and develop new research approaches SMEs, biotech firms, pharmaceutical companies, and academia should be actively en - gaged. The impact of the implemented levers should be continuously monitored and adjustments be taken if necessary. Becoming a knowledge hub for research and development of antibiotics: The collaboration platform could connect active researchers, improve access to scientific information and become a main advisor for researchers and pharmaceutical develop - ers. Stimulating the market: The collaboration platform could help to create and imple - ment incentive structures for science and businesses to enhance antibiotic research in industry and science. Organizational setup of the global antibiotics collaboration platformThere are different options on how to organizationally set up such a collaboration plat - form. Setting up the collaboration platform as a unit or as part of an existing multilateral organization (e.g., the WHO) has the main advantages of providing access to existing ex - pertise and networks as well as generating increased credibility. Covering the initial in - vestments and running costs for the collaboration platform is a joint responsibility of the states driving this effort. Using existing structures and networks could furthermore en - able a quicker implementation of the more urgent levers (e.g., the expert network). Financing of the global antibiotics collaboration platform The initial funding for setting up the collaboration platform could be provided by the states leading the charge against antimicrobial resistance. We also recommend that the pharmaceutical industry carry a share of the funding need, e.g., through a contribution based on antibiotics revenue (see chapter 5). 119 GAIN: How a New Law is Stimulating the Development of Antibiotics. The PEW Charitable Trusts. http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/ research-and- analysis/issue-briefs/2013/11/07/gain-how-a-new-law-is-stimulating-the-development-of-antibiotics, accessed 23 September 2015.The Boston Consulting Group 69 68 Breaking through the Wall 6.2 Conclusion Coordinating the market entry reward Different possible mechanisms for financing this lever are outlined in chapter 5. The Tar- get Product Profiles described in lever 1 form the basis for the final design of the market entry reward. Successful implementation of the market entry reward requires an open dialog with the pharmaceutical industry that is incentivized by this lever. Multiple pharmaceutical com - panies have called for a full or partial delinkage model in antibiotics. The primary re - quest is for a multiyear commitment; only then can a significant increase of investments into antibiotics by these firms be expected. Stakeholders from all sectors agree that de - signing a set of parameters that avoid \"gaming\" on the one hand, while providing suffi - cient certainty to the industry is challenging. Turnaround in antibiotics research and development The challenges in antibiotics research and development are immense. However, we be- lieve that with a global commitment and by applying the levers discussed in this report, the global community can overcome those challenges\u2014so that our generation and the generations to come can rely on effective protection against bacterial threats. 7. APPENDIX 7.1 Current status of global political context and actions A gathering political momentum Collective attention to the issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been mounting since 1999 when the European Council and an EU-United States summit issued declara - tions on the growing topic. Since then governments and international bodies have been progressively recognizing the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Thus, the acknowledge - ment of the scale, urgency and global nature of the challenge is growing. This trend is being supported by prominent international figures that are increasingly us - ing urgent language when addressing the issue. For example, the President of the United States has said that the effectiveness of antibiotics is a \"matter of national security\" and that \"they are, quite simply, essential to the health of our people and people every - where\" .120 The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Margret Chan, has stated, \"antimicrobial resistance is not a future threat looming on the horizon. It is here, right now, and the consequences are devastating\". Britain's Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, has referred to the \"discovery void\" and warned that \"antimicrobial re - sistance poses a catastrophic threat\"121 and German Chancellor Angela Merkel has put the issue high on the agenda of Germany's current presidency of the G7. As of today, the vast majority of OECD countries have made public their acknowledge - ment of the issue. Emergence of national-level action Many countries are already moving to address the issue on national levels. Specifically re - garding the lack of new antibiotics, some countries have already started incentivizing po - tential developers, in an attempt to return antibiotics to being an attractive therapeutic area for R&D. The United States is kick-starting the global pipeline using a broad variety of policy tools. The UK and Germany are also notable in the actions already taken to ad - dress the issue (for detailed analysis see chapter 7.2). However, these initiatives have not been able to provide a turnaround on a global level and a truly global response is still a long way off. Initiatives at a regional level National efforts have been running concurrently with initiatives at a regional level. The first effort to bring the issue to a higher-level was the creation in 2009 of the Transatlan - 120 Obama announces plan to fight antibiotic-resistant superbugs.

TATFAR is a collaboration be - tween the US (Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)) and EU (represented by the European Commission (EC)). They identified 17 recommendations covering 3 key areas, where exchange is facilitated. Regionally, the EU has been driving transnational push incentives, many of which have pulled in expertise from beyond the EU. Based on the EC's 2011 Action Plan Against the Rising Threats of AMR123 two main actions\u2014related to R&D\u2014have been the focus: To promote, in a staged approach, unprecedented collaborative R&D efforts to bring new antibiotics to patients To reinforce and coordinate research efforts Notable examples of this report are highlighted in chapter 4.1 and include increased funding for basic research projects through its FP7 and FP8 (Horizon 2020) framework agreements. Creation of a Joint Programming Initiative on AMR (JPIAMR) and an EU- wide public private partnership (PPP), the IMI comprising around seven antibiotic-rele - vant projects lead by the \u20ac 600 million New Drugs for Bad Bugs (ND4BB) program. Considerations of a global problem Regional level commitments are increasingly gathering momentum and taking on a more unified global voice\u2014through the use of trans-national forums such as the G7, G20 and World Economic Forum (WEF). Global bodies, such as the United Nations (UN) agencies, lead by the World Health Organization (WHO), have become active in assuming a global coordination role. Beginnings of a global dialogue With regards to global institutions, the World Health Assembly (WHA) has called on the United Nations to convene a high-level meeting of political leaders in 2016. This follows the 2015 World Health Assembly Resolution (WHA 67.25), that called on member states to have a national action plan that aligns with the tripartite Global Action Plan (GAP) in place by 2017 (see figure 25). The GAP resulted from an extensively consultative and col - laborative process.Source: TU BerlinFigure 25 | Overview of the recent global processes and outcomes on AMR WHO World Health OrganizationFAO Food & Agriculture Organization Global Action Plan (GAP) on AMR: May 2015 2015 World Health Assembly Resolution: Governments agreed that by May 2017 they must have in place a National Action Plan that aligns with the GAP Member states are encouraged to participate in international collaborative research to: Prioritize and support basic scientific research Strengthen existing and creating new PPPs Pilot innovative ideas for financing R&D and for the adoption of a new marketSecretariat Coordinates work of many unlinked invest-ment initiatives Identifies priorities for new products Acts as the vehicle for securing and man- aging investment in new products Establishes open collaborative models of R&D Facilitates affordable, equitable and rational accessOIE World Organisation for Animal Health 122 TATFAR Progress Report 201:4 Recommendations for future collaboration between the US and EU.

National strategies and action plans Antimicrobial Resistance and Use in Canada: A Federal Framework for Action124 This framework points out a coordinated, collaborative federal approach to responding to the threat of antimicrobial resistance and forms a foundation for interdisciplinary ac - tion on a local, national and global scale. Federal Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance and Use in Canada - March 2015125 The Action Plan builds on the strategic areas of focus and priority action items outlined in the Framework for Action (mentioned above) by identifying specific steps that will be undertaken. Examples for national initiatives enhancing research and development in antibiotics Novel Alternatives to Antibiotics (NAA) Funding Opportunity126, 127 The Novel Alternatives to Antibiotics is a governmental fund that focuses on supporting research into alternative methods of treating bacterial infections, for example, with the use of phages (discussed in chapter 3.1). A total exceeding of CAD 13 million in invest - ments has been made in such research. Canadian Foundation for Infectious Diseases128 This is a charitable foundation that raises funds for innovative research and is active in educating both the public and health-care professionals on topics related to antibiotic re - sistance. It also aims to attract new talent and retain experts in the field of antibiotics. This work is done in part with other Canadian organizations involved in infectious dis - ease and antibiotic development. Canadian Society of Microbiologists129 The Canadian Society of Microbiologists aims to foster advancement and collaboration in the field of microbiology, with antibiotic research being one of their areas of focus.

Their efforts concentrate on adding value and minimizing risk for innovative projects at the pre-industrial stage, as well as bridging discovery and clinical development. The institu - tion helps researchers to establish the proof of concept of their innovations and is in - volved in registering patents and searching for industrial partners. The National Alliance for Life Sciences and Healthcare (Avenir) Program (Action Th\u00e9matique et Incitative sur Programme (ATIP)133 The ATIP-Avenir Program is a funding program designed for young researchers and is jointly operated by French National Center for Scientific Research134 and the French Na - tional Institute of Health and Medical Research. It enables young scientists to build and lead a team within an established National Institute of Health and Medical Research or National Center for Scientific Research laboratory in France in order to conduct research in the fields of life and health sciences. This includes research in the prevention and treatment of infection by pathogens (e.g. antibiotics) in the field of immunity, infection and microbiology. Partnership agreement between French National Alliance for Life Sciences and Health and Sanofi-Aventis 135 Sanofi-Aventis has joined a corporate sponsorship agreement for the Action Th\u00e9matique et Incitative sur Programme (ATIP) - Avenir Program on the basis of an annual allowance to the program's participants, plus a promise to considerably invest in public-private re - search partnerships.The Boston Consulting Group 75 74 Breaking through the WallGermany Multiple German initiatives in antibiotics are intended to promote basic research. Fund- ing is often provided to public research institutions, but funds are also available to prom - ising projects in antibiotics research from other players. An antimicrobial resistance strat - egy was recently published. The majority of initiatives are led by the government. National strategies and action plans German Antimircobial Resistance Strategy 2020 (Deutsche Antibiotika-Resistenz - strategie, DART 2020)136 The strategy was developed by the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG), the Federal Minis - try of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMEL) and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in cooperation with numerous associations and organi - zations. The goal of the strategy is to reduce and avoid the spread of antibiotic resistance and nosocomial infections. The aim is to strengthen the One Health approach, expand monitoring systems, intensify preventive measures, establish or strengthen regional, na- tional and international cooperation and to support research and development. Examples for national initiatives enhancing research and development in antibiotics German Center for Infection Research (Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Infektionsfor - schung, DZIF) The German Center for Infection Research is an alliance of universities, university hospi - tals and federal research institutions with expertise in the area of infectious diseases. The Center is dedicated to meet the most important infectiological challenges with an integra - tive approach. The main objective is to accelerate the transmission of research results into practice. Two out of nine Thematic Translational Units (TTU) of the German Center for Infection Research devote their research to antibiotic resistance. The current research em - phasis is on hospital germs and antibiotic resistant bacteria as well as novel anti-infectives. Infect Control 2020137 Infect control 2020 is part of the \"Twenty20 - Partnership for Innovation\" initiative of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research situated at the Hans-Knoell-Institute138. It facili- tates cooperation between scientists and the industry in collaboration with patient associa - tions and the general public. The aim is to develop new strategies for early recognition, con- tainment and combating of infectious diseases. Therefore, 30 partners from research institutions, clinics and the industry from various sectors work together, in order to develop new concepts for infectious control. A main emphasis of projects is the development of in - formation and communication strategies for the systemic and long-term repression of multi-resistant pathogens. Another priority of the initiative is the development of new forms of interdisciplinary cooperation and promotion as well as qualification of young researchers. 136 DART 2020.

The goal is to promote research in new therapies for infectious diseases and the search for new sub - stances for antibiotics. Italy The focus of the Italian initiatives is primarily on a better understanding of the spread of antibiotic resistance through means of surveillance and monitoring programs. Other ef - forts in combating antibiotic resistance are directed at the responsible and appropriate use of antibiotics. The majority of initiatives are led by public institutions. Examples for national initiatives enhancing research and development in antibiotics Antibiotic Resistance Project141 The antibiotic resistance project is mandated by the National Institute of Health142 with the purpose of collecting data on antibiotic resistance through a network of sentinel labo - ratories. The surveillance data is submitted to the European Antimicrobial resistance in - teractive database. National Guidelines System (Sistema Nazionale per le Linee Guida, SNLG)143 The National Guidelines System is the result of an agreement between the Health Minis - try's General Directorate of Health Programming and the National Institute of Health. The purpose of the National Guidelines System program is to produce evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice on relevant clinical issues such as perioperative an - tibiotic prophylaxis in adults. This includes the promotion of evaluation processes in drug prescription and the creation of diagnostic and therapeutic paths. The main objectives of the National Guidelines System program regarding antibiotics are improving health care appropriateness and promoting a more responsible and appropriate use of antibiotics by means of improving healthcare professional's education and training.

October 2014.Japan Historically, Japanese pharmaceutical companies have been at the forefront of global an - tibiotics development. In recent years. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies shifted their focus to other areas of research. Still, a number of academic instutions are active in antibiotics research. Examples of national initiatives enhancing R&D in antibiotics National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID)145 The National Institute of Infectious Diseases is a research institute that is connected to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. It is involved in basic and applied research into infectious diseases, quality control of antibiotics and other drugs, monitoring of spread of diseases, and publication of information regarding infectious diseases. Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund146 This is a public-private partnership between the government of Japan, Japanese pharma - ceutical companies, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation147. Its goal is to screen com - pound libraries of the participating pharmaceutical companies to find new compounds that can be developed into drugs against infectious diseases. The focus is on tuberculosis, malaria, and other neglected diseases. While Japanese stakeholders are engaged in this project, the target population is mainly outside of Japan. Emerging / Re-emerging Infectious Diseases Project of Japan148 As part of Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development149, this project aims to promote research into infectious diseases both in Japan and overseas by providing re - search grants. In particular, it focuses on supporting the development of novel and effec - tive drugs and diagnostics agents. It also works to improve infection control measures.

The United Kingdom has also published their Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy. Additionally, several projects are privately initiated. National strategies and action plans UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Strategy 2013 to 2018151 The goal of the Strategy is to slow the development and spread of AMR. This is to be achieved by improving the knowledge and understanding of AMR, conserving the effec - tiveness of existing treatments and stimulating the development of new antibiotics, diag- nostics and novel therapies. Examples for national initiatives enhancing research and development in antibiotics Antimicrobial Resistance Funders Forum (AMRFF)152 The Antimicrobial Resistance Funders' Forum has been established to provide a forum for the sharing of information on activities relating to antibiotic resistance by key private and public member organizations, such as the Wellcome Trust153 and the Medical Research Council154. The Forum provides a framework for a more coordinated approach to tackling antibiotic resis - tance. The Funders Forum coordinates and supports the initiation of funding and delivery pro - grams and adds value to existing programs through synergy of activities and gap awareness. Innovate UK/ Medical research council Biomedical Catalyst scheme155 The Biomedical Catalyst scheme is a funding program jointly operated by Innovate UK156 and the Medical research council, supporting pre-clinical life science. Under this scheme, funding is awarded to projects exploring new approaches to antibiotic resistance. Grants are available to UK academics and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) seeking to move their research more quickly from discovery to commercialization. They are jointly financed by public and private funds. Three categories of grants are available at different stages of product develop - ment: Feasibility Award/ Confidence in Concept, Early Stage Award and Late Stage Award. National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts (NESTA) Longitude Prize Antibiotics 2014- 2019157 Longitude Prize 2014 is an offered award by the National Endowment for Science Technol - ogy and the Arts158. It is supported by public and private funds awarded for antibiotics. The prize is given to the candidate who contributes to the prevention of the rise of antibiotic re - sistance.
