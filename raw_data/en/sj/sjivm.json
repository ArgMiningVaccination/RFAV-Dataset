Yoga Although there is no proof of who discovered this unique style of exercise, its origin can be traced to the Indian civilization over five thousand years ago. The word Yoga comes from the Sanskrit word Yog which means union. It is said by making Yoga part of our daily routine we unite our consciousness with the universal consciousness. Pranayamas and Asanas are the two fundamental components to make the practice effective. The inhalation and exhalation of breath is known as Pranayama and the body position in which the breathing pattern takes place is known as the Asana. By bringing flexibility in the body and controlling the regulation of the breathing sequence can cure many common diseases like Diabetes, Blood Pressure, Osteoporosis, Arthritis, Asthma, to name a few. It also brings strength, endurance alongwith a youthful body and a glowing face. In ancient times Yoga was taught as an ascetic discipline in India but today it is getting famous around the world and being practised by every section of society for its impeccable results. Regular practice of meditation can bring tremendous changes within us. Meditation Meditation is a unique practice to strengthen the ability to concentrate and awaken the consciousness long lost in the chaotic circles of thoughts. It emphasises the importance of the 'power of now' i.e the importance of being present at the moment. Regular practice of meditation can bring tremendous changes within us. Not only does it help in reducing all sorts of mental illnesses and heart ailments but it also opens the door to new possibilities in terms of finding a perspective in life, realising our full potential, and most importantly liberating us from the chain of negative thoughts which are the root of all our downfalls in life. For thousands of years, monks of the east have been practising meditation to deepen their understanding of life and penetrate through the clouds of mystical forces. Great sages and peers have always said that meditation is a key to opening the third eye. While giving clarity in perception, strengthening intuition, improved concentration and decisiveness, the third eye can bring you to the state of blissfulness away from desire & sadness and unlock the door of spirituality. Ayurveda Ayurveda is the oldest form of medicine coming from the roots of ancient India. Based on the integrated approach of creating a balance between body, mind and soul, the treatment of Ayurveda begins with the treatment of Internal purification. It is the amalgamation of organic remedies that involves Yoga, meditation, massage therapy and a herbal diet. Just like a unique fingerprint, every individual has a particular pattern of energy that lies in the mind, body and soul. Ayurveda works in the direction of proper regulation of these energies. Vatta (the energy of movement), Pitta (the energy of metabolism and digestion) and Kapha (the energy of the structure) are the three basic energy forms, the imbalance of which causes diseases according to Ayurveda. Many people use Ayurveda as a complementary treatment in combination with allopathic treatment to heal completely from a particular disease. The ultimate goal of Yoga, Meditation and Ayurveda is to help one lead a healthier and balanced life. They may not give instant results but will surely bring a positive change within.
