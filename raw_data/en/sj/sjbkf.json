S\u00f8kestrategi i Cochrane av -rapporten som i stor grad har basert oss p\u00e5 - benyttet: Search methods for identification of reviews We searched Health Systems Evidence ( http://www.mcmasterhealthforum.org/hse/ ) in November 2010 using the following filters: health system topics = implementation strategies; type of synthesis = systematic review or Cochrane review; type of question = effectiveness; publication date range = 2000 - 2010. In March 2013, we searched PDQ (\"pretty darn \"Systematic Reviews\" with no other restrictions. We will update th at search periodically, ex- cluding records that were entered into PDQ -Evidence prior to the date of the last previous search. PDQ -Evidence is a database of evidence for decisions about health systems. It includes systematic reviews, overviews of reviews (in cluding evidence -based policy briefs) and studies included in system- atic reviews. The following databases are searched for PDQ -Evidence with no language or publication status restrictions: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR); Database of Abstrac ts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE); Health Technology Assessment Database; PubMed; LILACS; Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co -ordinating Centre (EPPI -Centre) Evidence Library; 3ie Systematic Reviews and Briefs; World Health Organ ization (WHO) Database; Campbell Library; Supporting the Use of Research Evidence (SURE) Guides for Preparing and Using Evidence - based Policy Briefs; European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies; UK Department for International Development (DFID); National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) public health guidelines and systematic reviews; Guide to Community Preventive Services; 6 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) Rx for Change; McMaster Plus KT+; McMaster Health Forum Evidence Briefs. The detailed search strategies for PubMed and LILACS can be found in Appendix 1. All records in the other databases were screened. In addition we screened all of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Groups reviews in Archie (the Cochrane Collaboration's central server for managing documents) (http://archie.cochrane.org/ ) and the reference lists of relevant policy briefs and overviews of reviews. We performed an up dated search in PDQ -Evidence in June 2014. Appendix 1.

Did the authors specify: Types of studies Participants Intervention(s) Outcome(s) Coding guide - check the answers above YES: All four should be yes Yes Can't tell/partially No Comments (note important limitations or uncertainty) A.2 Was the search for evidence reasonably com- prehensive? Were the following done: Language bias avoided (no restriction of inclusion based on language) No restriction of inclusion based on public ation sta- tus Relevant databases searched (including Medline + Cochrane Library) Reference lists in included articles checked Authors/experts contacted Coding guide - check the answers above: YES: All five should be yes PARTIALLY: Relevant databases and refer- ence lists are both ticked off Yes Can't tell/partially No Comments (note important limitations or uncertainty) 9 A.3 Is the review reasonably up -to-date? Were the searches done recently enough that more recent research is unlikely t o be found or to change the results of the review? Coding guide - consider how many years since the last search (e.g. if more than 10 years the review is unlikely to be up -to-date) and whether there is ongoing research Yes Can't tell/not sure No Comments (note important limitations or uncertainty) A.4 Was bias in the selection of articles avoided? Did the authors specify: Explicit selection criteria Independent screening of full text by at least 2 re- viewers List of included studies provi ded List of excluded studies provided Coding guide - check the above YES: All four should be yes Yes Can't tell/partially No Comments (note important limitations or uncertainty) A.5 Did the authors use appropriate criteria to as- sess the ris k for bias in analysing the studies that are included? ( See Appendix for an example of criteria - Assessing Risk of Bias Criteria for EPOC Reviews) The criteria used for assessing the risk of bias were reported A table or summary of the assessment of each in- cluded study for each criterion was reported Sensible criteria were used that focus on the risk of bias (and not other qualities of the studies, such as precision or applicability) Coding guide - check the above YES: All four should be yes Yes Can't tell/partially No Comments (note important limitations or uncertainty) A.6 Overall - how would you rate the methods used to identify, include and critically appraise studies? Summary assessment score A relates to the 5 ques- tions above. If the \"No\" or \"Partial\" option is used for any of the questions above, the review is likely to have important limitations. Examples of major limitations might include not report- ing explicit selection criteria, not providing a list of in- cluded studies or not assessing the risk of bias in in- cluded studies. Major limitation s (limitations that are important enough that the results of the review are not reliable and they should not be used in the policy brief) Important limitations (limitations that are im- portant enough that it would be worthwhile to search for another systematic review and to interpret the re- sults of this review cautiously, if a better review cannot be found) Reliable (only minor limitations) 10 Comments (note any major or important limitatio ns). 11 Section B: Methods used to analyse the findings B.1 Were the characteristics and results of the in- cluded studies reliably reported? Was there: Independent data extraction by at least 2 reviewers A table or summary of the characteristics of the participants, interventions and outcomes for the in- cluded studies A table or summary of the results of the included studies. Coding guide - check the answers above YES: All three should be yes Yes Partially No Not applicable (e.g. no included studies) Comments (note important limitations or uncertainty) B.2 Were the methods used by the review authors to analyse the findings of the included studies re- ported? Yes Partially No Not applicable (e.g. no studies or no data) Comments (n ote important limitations or uncertainty) B.3 Did the review describe the extent of heteroge- neity? Did the review ensure that included studies were similar enough that it made sense to combine them, sensibly divide the included studies into homogeneo us groups, or sensibly conclude that it did not make sense to combine or group the included studies? Did the review discuss the extent to which there were important differences in the results of the in- cluded studies? If a meta -analysis was done, was th e I2, chi square test for heterogeneity or other appropriate statistic re- ported? Yes Can't tell/partially No Not applicable (e.g. no studies or no data) Comments (note important limitations or uncertainty) 12 B.4 Were the findings of the releva nt studies combined (or not combined) appropriately relative to the primary question the review addresses and the available data? How was the data analysis done? Descriptive only Vote counting based on direction of effect Vote counting based on stati stical significance Description of range of effect sizes Meta -analysis Meta -regression Other: specify Not applicable (e.g. no studies or no data) How were the studies weighted in the analysis? Equal weights (this is what is done when vote count- ing is used) By quality or study design (this is rarely done) Inverse variance (this is what is typically done in a meta -analysis) Number of participants Other, specify: Not clear Not applicable (e.g. no studies or no data) Did the review addre ss unit of analysis errors? Yes - took clustering into account in the analysis (e.g. used intra -cluster correlation coefficient) No, but acknowledged problem of unit of analysis errors No mention of issue Not applicable - no clustered trials or stu dies in- cluded Coding guide - check the answers above If narrative OR vote counting (where quantitative anal- yses would have been possible) OR inappropriate ta- ble, graph or meta -analyses OR unit of analyses errors not addressed (and should have been) the ans wer is likely NO. If appropriate table, graph or meta -analysis AND appro- priate weights AND the extent of heterogeneity was taken into account, the answer is likely YES. If no studies/no data: NOT APPLICABLE If unsure: CAN'T TELL/PARTIALLY Yes Can't tel l/partially No Not applicable (e.g. no studies or no data) Comments (note important limitations or uncertainty) B.5 Did the review examine the extent to which specific fac- tors might explain differences in the results of the included studies? Were factors that the review authors considered as likely ex- planatory factors clearly described? Was a sensible method used to explore the extent to which key factors explained heterogeneity? Descriptive/textual Graphical Meta -regression Other Yes Can't tell/partially No Not applicable (e.g. too few studies, no important differences in the results of the in- cluded studies, or the included studies were so dissimilar that it would not make sense to explore heterogeneity of the results) 13 Comments (note important limitations or uncertainty) B.6 Overall - how would you rate the methods used to ana- lyse the findings relative to the primary question addressed in the review? Summary assessment score B relates to the 5 questions in this section, reg arding the analysis. If the \"No\" or \"Partial\" option is used for any of the 5 preceding questions, the review is likely to have important limitations. Examples of major limitations might include not reporting critical characteristics of the included studi es or not reporting the results of the included studies. Major limitations (limitations that are important enough that the results of the re- view are not reliable and they should not be used in the policy brief) Important limitations (limitations that are important enough that it would be worthwhile to search for another systematic review and to interpret the results of this re- view cautiously, if a better review cannot be found) Reliable (only minor limitations) Use comments to specify if relevant, t o flag uncertainty or need for discussion Section C: Overall assessment of the reliability of the review C.1 Are there any other aspects of the review not mentioned before which lead you to question the results? Additional methodological concerns Robustness Interpretation Conflicts of interest (of the review authors or for in- cluded studies) Other No other quality issues identified C.2 Based on the above assessments of the methods how would you rate the reliability of the review? Major limitations (exclude); briefly (and politely) state the reasons for excluding the review by completing the following sentence: This review was not included in this policy brief for the following reasons: Comments (briefly summarise any key messages or useful information that can be drawn from the review for policy makers or managers): Important limitations ; briefly (and politely) state the most important limitations by editing the following sen- tence, if needed, and specifying what the important li mitations are: This review has important limitations. Reliable ; briefly note any comments that should be noted regarding the reliability of this review by editing the following sentence, if needed: This is a well-conducted systematic rev iew with only minor limitations. 14 NOTES Risk of bias is the extent to which bias may be responsible for the findings of a study. Bias is a systematic error or deviation from the truth in results or inferences. In studies of the effects of health care, the main t ypes of bias arise from systematic differences in the groups that are compared (selection bias), the care that is provided, or exposure to other factors apart from the intervention of interest (performance bias), withdrawals or exclusions of people entered into a study (attrition bias) or how outcomes are assessed (detection bias). Reviews of studies may also be particularly affected by reporting bias, where a biased subset of all the relevant data is available. Assessments of the risk of bias are sometimes also referred to as assessments of the va- lidity or quality of a study. Validity is the extent to which a result (of a measurement or study) is likely to be true. Quality is a vague notion of the strength or validity of a study, often indicating the extent of control over bias. 15 Vedlegg 3.

Clinical decision -support systems are electronic systems designed to aid health professionals directly in cl inical decision -making. They use infor- mation about individual patients to generate patient -specific assessments or recommendations. Key messages Clinical decision -support systems improve adherence to clinical prac- tice recommendations. Clinical decision -support systems probably lead to a modest improvement in morbidity outcomes. Clinical decision -support systems may reduce treatment costs and total costs (low certainty of the evidence), but their cost -effectiveness is uncer- tain. Summary includes: - Summary of research findings , based on one or more systematic reviews of research on this topic - Relevance for low and middle income countries Doesn't include : - Recommendations - Cost assess ments - Results from qualitative stuides - Examples or detailed descriptions of implementation Who is this summary for?

A summary of studies addressing a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise the relevant research, and to c ollect and analyse data from the included studies SUPPORT - an international collaboration funded by the EU 6th Framework Programme to support the use of policy relevant reviews and trials to inform decisions about maternal and child health in low - and m iddle -income countries. www.support -collaboration.org Glossary www.supportsummaries.org/glossary Background refere nces on this topic: See back page 47 Background There are m any types of clinical decision -support systems. This systematic re- view examined three categories of decision -support systems: 1) \"Classic systems\" that typically include alerts, reminders, order sets, or drug -dose calculations which automatically remind t he clinician of a specific action, or care summary dashboards that provide performance feedback on quality indicators. 2) Information retrieval tools - e.g. an \"infobutton\" embedded in a clinical in- formation system - designed to aid clinicians in the searc h and retrieval of context -specific knowledge from information sources based on patient -specific information from a clinical information system. 3) Knowledge resources - e.g. UpToDate, Epocrates, and MD Consult - that consist of distilled primary literatu re that allows selection of content relevant to a specific patient to facilitate decision making at the point of care. How this summary was prepared The methods used to assess the reliability of the revi ew are described here: www.supportsummaries.org/methods Knowing what's not known is important A reliable review might not find any well-designed studies. Although that is disappointing, it is importa nt to know what is not known as well as what is known. A lack of evidence does not mean a lack of effects. It means the effects are uncertain. When there is a lack of evidence, consideration should be given to monitoring and evaluating the effects of the intervention, if it is used.

Effect of clinical decision -support systems: a systematic review. Annals of internal medicine. 2012;157(1):29 -43 48 Summary of findings 148 studies were included in this review. Most studies (128) assessed whether clinical decision -support systems influenced clinicians' decision making, and 29 studies assessed clinical outcomes. Costs were reported in in 22 studies. The studies found that clinical decision -support systems improve clinical decision making (adherence to recommendations). Furthermore, such systems probably have a modest effect on health outcomes. The certainty of this evidence was moderate. Evidence from academic and community inpatient and ambulatory settings showed that locally and commercially developed clinical decision -support syst ems may reduce treatment costs and total costs, but the findings of six cost -effectiveness studies were inconsistent. None of the studies reported effects of clinical decision -support systems on the number of patients seen per unit time or clinician worklo ad. Clinical decision -support systems increase adherence to clinical practice recommendations. The certainty of this evidence is high. Clinical decision -support systems probably lead to a modest improvement in morbidity outcomes. The certainty of this evid ence is moderate. Clinical decision -support systems may reduce treatment costs and total costs (low certainty of the evidence), but their cost -effectiveness is uncer- tain because the certainty of the evidence is very low. About the certainty of the evidence (GRADE) * High : It is very likely that the effect will be close to what was found in the research. Moderate: It is likely that the effect will be close to what was found in the resea rch, but there is a possibility that it will be substantially different. Low: It is likely that the effect will be substantially different from what was found in the research, but the research provides an indication of what might be expected. Very lo w: The anticipated effect is very uncertain and the research does not provide a reliable indication of what might be expected. *This is sometimes referred to as 'quality of evidence' or 'confidence in the estimate'.

Reminders may provide important information or advice to healthc are professionals in an accessible and relevant format at a particularly appropriate time. For example, when a doctor sees a patient for an annual check -up, she might receive the patient's chart with a reminder section detailing the screening tests that ar e due that year. Key messages Computer -generated reminders delivered on paper probably improve professional practice. If the reminders provide space to enter a response and if they provide an explanation, they may be more effective than if they do not. Reminders may be more effective for providing vaccinations than other reminders, while reminders to discuss issues with patients may be less effective. Who is this summary for?

Background Clinical practice does not always reflect best practice and evidence, partly because of subconscious acts of omission, information overload, or inaccessible information. Re- minders might help clinicians overcome these problems by prompting the doctor to re- call information that they already know or would be expected to know and by providing inform ation or guidance in a more accessible and relevant format, at a particularly ap- propriate time.

These \"point of care\" -types of reminders are of great interest to those involved i n quality improvement efforts because of their likely low marginal cost, and because they can address multiple topics. This review did not include other types of reminders, e.g. letters sent to physicians to remind them to follow up specific patients. As for most other quality improvement interventions, reminders primarly focus on improving processes of care, such as prescribing of drugs in accordance with clinical practice guidelines or encouraging smokers to stop. The main goal is, of course, to improve clinical outcomes, i.e. improve the patients' health.

Educational outreach visits: effects on professional practice and health care outcomes. The Cochrane database of systematic reviews. 2007(4):CD000409. 64 February 2014 - SUPPORT Summary of a systematic review Do educational outreach visits improve health professional practice and patient outcomes? Educational outreach visits entail the use of a trained person from outside the practice setting to meet with healthcare profess ionals in their practice. They provide information that may include feedback about professional performance with the intent of improving practice. This type of face -to-face visit is also called academic detailing and educational visiting. The intervention may be tailored based upon previously identified barriers to change or combined with other interventions, including reminders or interventions targeted directly at patients, such as recall clinics. Key messages The quality of care delivered to patients - can be improved by educational outreach visits alone; and - may be improved more by educational outreach visits combined with organisational changes, than by educational outreach visits alone For prescribing, the effects are relatively consistent and small, b ut potentially important. For other types of professional performance, the effects vary widely from small to mod- est improvements.

About the systematic review underlying this summary Review objective: To assess the effects of educational outreach on health professional practice and patient outcomes Types of What the review authors searched for What the rev iew authors found Study designs & Interventions Randomised trials of educational outreach to healthcare professionals by trained persons that may be from the same organisation, but not from the same practice site. The information given may include feedba ck about their perfor- mance. 69 trials were found. Participants Healthcare professionals responsible for patient care. Primary care physicians or teams practising in community set- tings (53 studies), physicians in hospital settings (6), nurses and nursing a ssistants (4), pharmacists/owners and counter attend- ants (2), dentists (1). Settings Any practice setting. Mostly primary and community healthcare settings. The studies were from the USA (23), the UK (22), Europe (14), Australia (8), Indonesia (2) and Tha iland (1). Outcomes Objectively measured professional performance in a healthcare setting or healthcare outcomes. Studies that only measured knowledge or per- formance in a test situation were excluded. Most studies reported multiple effect measures and ma ny did not specify a primary outcome. Twenty -eight studies (34 com- parisons) contributed to the calculation of the median for the main comparison of professional performance. Educational out- reach was compared to another type of intervention, usually au- dit a nd feedback, in 8 trials (12 comparisons).

Most studies (36) were done in Europe, North America (23), a nd Australia (8). Three studies were conducted in middle -income countries in Asia. 1) Educational outreach compared to no intervention There were 37 trials that reported changes in professional performance. The 12 studies that reported patient outcomes we re largely inconclusive, even when improvements in health professional practice were found, most likely because of insufficient power to detect important differences in patient outcomes.

Interventions that included outreach visits appeared to be more effective than audit and feedback alone. The differences tended to be small, similar to the differences between outreach vis its and no intervention. One trial found a large improvement (39%) in the care of patients with cardiovascular risk factors with outreach visits and a prevention coordinator compared to outreach visits alone. One trial measured patient outcomes. It found a n increase in the percentage of patients achieving blood pressure control after clinicians received an educational outreach visit that included audit and feedback as well as a reminder. Educational outreach may improve health professional practices compar ed to audit and feedback. The certainty of this evidence was low. Organisational changes, such as introducing a prevention coordinator, may be more effective than outreach visits alone. The certainty of this evidence was low. 68 Additional information Related literature Grimshaw JM, Shirran L, Thomas R, Mowatt G, Fraser C, Bero L, Grilli R, Harvey E, Oxman AD, O'Brien M.

Lec- ture-based educative strategies used to disseminate evidence -based guidelines are of- ten ineffective while multifaceted interventions including strategies such as interactive education and reminders are often more effective. Pra ctice facilitation is a multifaceted approach that uses internal or external individuals to encourage evidence -based prac- tice. About half of the studies in the review used registered nurses or masters' educated individuals with training as practice facilit ators. All studies included audit with feed- back, practice consensus building and goal setting as key components, as well as qual- ity improvement strategies directed to the system or organization such as plan -do- study -act. Many also incorporated collaborativ e meetings, either face to face or virtual. There was variation in the process of implementation among the studies related to the facilitator qualifications, tools employed (e.g. audit, feedback, reminder systems, etc.), intensity (from 2 meetings each 0.2 5 hrs to 18 meetings each 6 hours) and duration of intervention (from 2 to 26 months) .

Annals of family medicine. 2012;10(1):63 -74. 72 Summary of findings The review found 23 studies conducted in high -income countries that evaluated the use of practice facilitation to improve adoption of evidence -based guidelines. The interventions varied considerably including components such as audit and feedback, consensus building and goal setting, and collaborative meetings. The duration and intensity of the intervention also varied considerably. The studies measured changes in evidence -based practice in different ways, depending on the target behavior, evidence -based guideline and intervention components. Practice facilitation for improving adoption of evidence - based guidelines in primary care settings. 23 studies conducted in primary care settings in high -income countries measured the mean change in target behavior as a result of the intervention. Practice facilitation probably improves the adoption of evidence -based guidelines in primary care settings (mod erate certainty evidence).

By \"sub stantially different\" we mean a large enough difference that it might affect a decision. These judgements are made using the GRADE system, and are provided for each outcome. The judgements are based on the study design (randomised trials versus observation al studies), factors that reduce the certainty (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias) and factors that increase the certainty (a large effect, a dose response relationship, and plausible confounding).

The Cochrane database of systematic reviews. 2012;6:CD000259. 76 February 2014 - SUPPORT Summary of a systematic review Does providing healthcare profes sionals with data about their performance improve their practice? Audit and feedback is commonly used as a strategy to improve professional practice. It appears logical that healthcare professionals would be prompted to modify their practice if given feedb ack that their clinical practice was inconsistent with that of their peers or accepted guidelines. Key messages Interventions that include audit and feedback (alone or as a core component of a mul- tifaceted intervention) probably improve slightly professio nals' adherence to de- sired practice compared with usual care The effects on patient outcomes of interventions that include audit and feedback may range from little or no difference to some improvement, compared with usual care The effects of audit and feed back vary depending on the way the intervention is de- signed and delivered The effects of audit and feedback on adherence with desired practice or patient out- comes, when compared to other implementation strategies (e.g. reminders, edu- cational outreach), are mixed Who is this summary for?

Feedbac k can be given in a written, electronic or verbal format. The summary of clinical performance may also include recommendations for clinical action. As audit and feedback is used widely within health care organisations, it is important to consider its lik ely effects on clinical performance. About the systemat ic review underlying this summary Review objective: To assess the effects of audit and feedback on the practice of healthcare professionals and on patient outcomes Types of What the review authors searched for What the review authors found Study desi gns & Interventions Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of au- dit and feedback. Interventions were only included if audit and feedback was a core or essential element 140 RCTs were included. The interventions used were highly heteroge neous with respect to their content, format, timing and source. Targeted behaviours were prescribing (39 RCTs), management of patients with diabetes or cardiovascular diseases (34 RCTs), and test ordering (31 RCTs). The remaining RCTs varied widely in te rms of health conditions and targeted behav- iours. Participants Healthcare professionals respon- sible for patient care In most of the RCTs the healthcare professionals were physicians. Other provid- ers targeted included dentists (1 RCT), nurses (3 RCTs), pha rmacists (2 RCTs) and mix of providers (14 RCTs). Settings Healthcare settings Country: USA (69), Canada (11), UK or Ireland (21), Australia or New Zealand (10), and elsewhere (29). Only 4 studies were conducted in LMICs: Sudan (2), Thailand (1), and Laos (1). Health care setting: outpatient settings (94 RCTs), inpatient settings (36 RCTs). In 10 RCTs the clinical setting was unclear. Outcomes Objectively measured provider performance or healthcare out- comes There was large variation in outcome measures, and many trials reported multi- ple primary outcomes. Most trials measured professional practice, with some also reporting patient outcomes. Date of most recent search: December 2010 Limitations: This is a well conducted systematic review with only minor limitations. Ivers N et al. Audit and feedback: effects on professional practice and health care outcomes. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2012, Issue 6. How this summary was prepared The methods used to assess the quality of the review are described here: www.supportsummaries.org/methods Knowing what's not known is important A reliable review might not any well - designed studies. Although that is disappointing, it is important to know what is not known as well as what is known. A lack of evidence does not mean a lack of effects. It means the effects are uncertain. When there is a lack of evidence, consideration should be given to monitoring and evaluating the effects of the intervention, if it is used. 78 Summary of findings The review included 140 trials. Most trials were conducted in high income countries (136). Four trials were conducted in low - and middle -income countries (two in Sudan and one each in Thailand an d Laos). The interventions used were very varied in terms of content, format, timing and source. In 121 trials, audit and feedback was targeted at physicians and in 91 trials one or more groups received a multifaceted intervention where audit and feedbac k was considered the core, essential component. Many trials reported multiple primary outcomes. Most trials reported professional practice outcomes, such as prescribing or use of laboratory tests, while some trials also reported patient outcomes, such as smoking status or blood pressure. 1) Audit and feedback (with or without other interventions) compared to usual care A total of 133 comparisons from 85 trials were included in the primary analysis. There was important heterogeneity in the results across trials. Interventions that include audit and feedback probably improve slightly profession- als' adherence to desired practice, compared with usual care. The certainty of the evidence was moderate The effects on patient outcomes of interventions that include audit and feedback may range from little or no difference to some improvement, compared with usual care. The certainty of the evidence was low The effects of audit and feedback appear to vary based on the way the intervention is designed and delivered. A udit and feedback may be more effective when baseline professional performance is low; when the source of the feed- back is a supervisor or senior colleague; when the feedback is delivered at least monthly; when it is provided both verbally and in a written format; and when it includes both explicit targets and an action plan About quality of evidence (GRADE) High : It is very likely that the effect will be clos e to what was found in the research. Moderate: It is likely that the effect will be close to what was found in the research, but there is a possibility that it will be substantially different. Low: It is likely that the effect will be substantially d ifferent from what was found in the research, but the research provides an indication of what might be expected. Very low: The anticipated effect is very uncertain and the research does not provide a reliable indication of what might be expected.

The effect was weighted across studies by the number of health professionals involved in the study to ensur e that small trials did not contribute as much t o the estimate of effect as large trials. 2Many studies had more than two arms and therefore contributed multiple comparisons of audit and feedback versus usual care 2) Audit and feedback compared to other interventions A total of 22 comparisons from 2 0 trials were included in this analysis. The effects of audit and feedback on adherence with desired practice or patient outcomes, when compared to other im- plementation strategies (e.g. reminders, educational outreach, case management, financial incentive s, patient -me- diated interventions), are mixed 80 Additional information Related literature Gardner B, Whittington C, McAteer J, Eccles MP, Michie S.

The Cochrane datab ase of systematic reviews. 2011(8):CD000125. 82 March 2015 - SUPPORT Summary of a systematic review Does use of local opinion leaders improve professional practice and patient outcomes? Opinion leaders are a small number of individuals in a community who have an outsize influence on what the rest of the communty does. They are active media users, who interpret the meaning of media messages or content for lower -end media users. Because of their influence, it i s thought that opinion leaders may be able to persuade healthcare providers to use the best available evidence when treating and managing patients. Key messages Opinion leaders probably influence the behaviour of healthcare professionals. Patient outcome data were not reported by studies included in the review. Who is this summary for?

One way of doing this may be through the use of local opinion leaders. Opinion leaders are active voices in their community, people who speak out and get asked for advice a lot. Such individuals are held in high esteem by those who accept their opinions. This review addresses the effectiveness of local opinion leaders in improving professional practice and patient outcomes. This summary is based on an updated Cochrane Review published in 2011 by Gerd Flodgren and colleagues, which assessed the effectiveness of the use of local opinion leaders to disseminate and implement evidence -based practice.

Although that is disappointing, it is important to know what is not known as well as what is known. 84 Summary of findings The review identified 18 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving more than 296 hos- pitals and 318 primary care physicians , mostly in high -income countries. Targeted behav- iours involved the general management of a clinical problem in in obstetrics (5 RCTs), cardiology (4 RCTs), oncology (3 RCTs), and other medical conditions (6 RCTs) . Opinion leaders were used alone in five RCTs, and supplemented by other strategies (such as au- dit and feedback, reminders, faxed evidence summaries, printed educational materials, educational meetings, and workshops) in 13 RCTs. The duration of follow -up, varied widely, ranging from one week to 18 months . Combining evidence from the 18 studies show that: Use of local opinion leaders probably improves the behaviour of healthcare profes- sionals. The certainty of the evidence was moderate. Patient outcome data were not reported by studies included in the review. Local opinion leaders alone or together with other intervention(s) compared with no intervention, the same other intervention or other interventions for improving compliance with desired practice Population: Physicians (n=14 studies); n urses (n=2); physicians, nurses (n=2). Settings: Hospitals (n=14), primary care practice (n=1), both primary and secondary care (n=1), and undefined healthcare settings (n=2) ; in USA (n=10), Canada (n=6), China (n=1), and Argentina and Urugu ay (n=1) Intervention: Local opinion leaders with or without other interventions Comparison: No intervention or other intervention(s) Outcomes Adjusted absolute im- provement (risk differ- ence)* Median (Interquartile range) Number of studies Certainty of the evidence (GRADE) Comments Compliance with desired practice Median +12% (+6% to +14.5%) 18 studies Moderate$ The effects of opinion leader interventions varied across the 63 out- comes reported, from 15% decrease in compliance to 72% increase in compliance with desired practice. The median adjusted absolute increase for the main comparisons were: i) Opinion leaders versus no intervention, +9%; ii) Opinion leaders alone vs a single intervention, +14%; iii) Opinion leaders with one or more ad- ditio nal intervention(s) vs the one or more additional intervention(s), +10%; and iv) Opinion leaders as part of multiple interventions com- pared to no intervention, +10%. * The post -intervention risk differences are adjusted for pre -intervention differences b etween the comparison groups. $ We rated down the evidence for heterogeneity of effects. The effects of interventions across the 63 outcomes reported varied from a 15% decrease in compliance to a 72% increase in compliance with desired practice. About quality of evidence (GRADE) High : Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence i n the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low: We are very uncertain about the e stimate.

The level of effectiveness has varied not only between different strategies, but also when the same strategy has been used on different occasions. Tailored implementation strategies r equire the identification of important barriers to change and the selection of implementation strategies most likely to be effective in addressing them. Tailoring strategies might help to maximise their potential impact. There are a variety of ways to iden tify barriers and to select ways to address them. Methods to identify barries include: making informal judgements, brainstorming, surveys, interviews, focus groups and observations. Methods to select ways to address identified barriers include theory -based approaches and experimental modeling of potential interventions. About the systematic review underlying this summary Review objective: To assess the effectiveness of interventions tailored to address identified barriers to change on professional practic e or patient outcomes Types of What the review authors searched for What the review authors found Study designs & interventions Randomised trials of interventions tailored to address prospectively identified barriers to change. Studies had to involve a comparison group that did not receive a tailored intervention or a comparison between an intervention that was targeted at both individual and social or organisational barriers, compared with an inter- vention targeted at only individual barriers. Thirty -two randomised trials. Interventions assessed were varied and included (among others): printed materials; educational outreach; clinical guidelines; patients; facilitation/practic e meetings; and individual/group academic detailing. Participants Healthcare professionals responsible for patient care. Primarily physicians (14 studies), mixed professional groups (8), nurses (4); pharmacists (2), geriatric teams (1), gynaecology teams (1), and physicians (1). Settings Any setting Primary care or community settings (17 studies), hospital settings (7), nursing homes (3), and one each in child health clinics, community pharmacies, a regional health system, and a Medicaid program. The studies were conducted in the United States of America (USA) (12), the Netherlands (5), the United Kingdom (UK) (4), Belgium (2), Indonesia (2), Norway (2), South Africa (2), and Canada (1), Ireland (1), and Portugal (1). Outcomes Objectively measured profe ssional performance (excluding self -reporting) or patient outcomes in a healthcare setting or both.

When there is a lack of evidence, consideration should be given to monitoring and evaluating the ef fects of the intervention, if it is used. 89 Summary of findings The review included 32 studies. The studies used a variety of methods to identify barriers, including face -to-face interviews, focus gr oups with physicians or patients, surveys, workshop discussions, telephone interviews, literature reviews or brainstorming by opinion leaders. The participants in the studies were mostly physicians and nurses. The interventions included the distribution o f printed materials, educational outreach, workshop activities, small discussion groups, auditing and feedback. Most of the interventions were targeted at changing prescribing behaviour. Tailored interventions compared to no intervention or guidelines alo ne Mixed results were found both across and within the included studies. There was variation in the reporting of how barriers had influenced the design of the intervention. The selection of interventions often relied on the judgements of the investigators and was not informed by explicit theories of behavioural or organisational change. Seventeen studies compared a tailored intervention to no intervention, of which it was possible to include seven in the main analysis. Fifteen sutides compared a tailored intervention to a non -tailored intervention, of which it was possible to include eight in the main analysis. In all but one of the eight trials, the non -tailored intervention consisted of the dissemination of written educational materials or guidelines. The odds ratio ranged from 1.08 to 10.59 for the 15 studies included in the main analysis. The 17 studies not included in the main analysis had findings showing variable effectiveness consistent with the studies included in the main analysis. The combined (ave rage) odds ratio for these 15 studies was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.27 to 1.93), in favour of tailored interventions. In a situation where adherence with recommended practice was initially 60% this would correspond to an improvement to 70%. In a situation where adhe rence was initially 20% this would correspond to an improvement to 28%. The authors investigated the following possible causes of variability in the effect of tailored interventions across the 15 studies: the type of control group (no intervention versu s dissemination of written educational materials or guidelines), the risk of bias, explicit utilisation of a theory to select the interventions, adjustment to local factors, and the number of domains addressed by the determinants identified. None of these were found to be associated with the reported effectiveness of the tailored interventions. Tailored interventions probably improve professional practice compared to no intervention or the dissemination of guidelines alone. The certainty of this evidence wa s moderate. It is uncertain whether tailored interventions are more likely to improve professional practice than non -tailored interventions. About the certainty of the evidence (GRADE) * High : It is very likely that the effect will be close to what was found in the research. Moderate: It is likely that the effect will be close to what was found in the research, but there is a possibility that it will be substantially different. Low: It is likely that the effect will be substantially different from what was found in the research, but the research provides an indication of what might be expected . Very low: The anticipated effect is very uncertain and the research does not provide a reliable indication of what might be expected. *This is sometimes referred to as 'quality of evidence' or 'confidence in the estimate'.

The OR and confidence intervals shown are taken from a meta -regression. The results of 14 studi es not included in the meta -regression indicated that, on average, tailored interventions improve professional practice.

Continuing education meetings and workshops: ef fects on professional practice and health care outcomes. The Cochrane database of systematic reviews. 2009(2):CD003030 93 October 2014 - SUPPORT Summary of a systematic review Do continuing education meetings and workshops for healthcare profession als improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes? An important aim of continuing education for healthcare professionals is to improve professional practice so that patients can receive improved health care. E ducational meetings and printed educational materials are the most common types of continuing education for health professionals. Educational meetings include lectures, workshops and courses. The meetings can be highly variable in terms of content, number of participants, the degree and type of interaction, length and frequency. Key messages Educational meetings alone or combined with other interventions probably improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes for patients. Educational meetings may b e more effective with higher attendance at the educa- tional meetings, mixed interactive and didactic educational meetings compared to only interactive or only didactic educational meetings. Educational meetings may not be effective for complex behaviours an d they may be less effective for less serious outcomes.

A summary of studies addressing a clearly formulated ques tion that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise the relevant research, and to collect and analyse data from the included studies SUPPORT - an international collaboration funded by the EU 6th Framework Programme to support the use of policy relevant reviews and trials to inform decisions about maternal and child health in low - and middle -income countries. www.support -collaboration.org Glossary of terms used in this report: www.supportsummaries.org/glossary Background references on this topic: See back page 94 Background Health professionals need continuing education to be updated and improve practice. In many countries continuing medical education is mandated by professional or regulatory bodies or stim ulated by incentives. Each year billions of dollars worldwide are spent on continuing medical education activities. Nearly all health professionals in high -income countries attend educational meetings, such as lectures and workshops. The amount of continui ng education time spent at educational meetings is second only to the amount of time spent reading, by self -report. This summary is based upon an update of a systematic review on continuing education meetings and workshopspublished in 2009. How this summary was prepared The methods used to assess the reliability of the review are described here: www.supportsummaries.org/methods Knowing what's not known is important A reliable review might not find any well-designed studies. Although that is disappointing, it is important to know what is not known as well as what is known. A lack of evidence does not mean a lack of effects. It means the effects are uncertain. When there is a lack of evidence, consideration sho uld be given to monitoring and evaluating the effects of the intervention, if it is used. 95 About the systematic review underlying this summary Review objective: To address the following questions: 1) Do educational meetings and workshops improve profes- sional practice and healthcare outcomes? 2) What are the effects of educational meetings compared with the effects of other interventions? and 3) Can changes in how educational meetings are done increase the effects Types of What the review authors searche d for What the review authors found Study designs & Interventions The following types of educational meetings: conferences, lectures, work- shops, seminars, symposia and courses. Only randomised trials were included. 81 trials were found (74 cluster random ised trials, 7 randomised by providers). Targeted behaviours were preventive care (11), test ordering (3), screening (6), prescribing (13), general management of a wide array of problems (41) and other (7). The interventions were multifaceted in 32 studies . Participants Studies involving qualified health pro- fessionals or health professionals in post-graduate training were included. Studies involving only undergraduate students were excluded. The health professionals were physicians in most tri- als, nurses ( 2), pharmacists (3), prescribers (1), or mixed providers (18). Settings All healthcare settings (primary care and hospital care). General practice (43), community -based care (16), hospital - based care (17) and 'other type of settings' (5). Studies were fr om USA (28), UK (14), Netherlands (10), Canada (4), Australia (3), Norway (3), France (2); Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Spain, Scotland (1 each); Indonesia (2), South -Africa (2); Mali, Thailand, Peru, Mexico, Zambia, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Brazil (1 each) . Outcomes All objectively measured health profes- sional practice behaviours or patient outcomes. There was wide variation in the outcome measures and number of outcomes measured. Median follow - up was 6 months (range 14 days to 2 years). Date of most rec ent search: March 2006 Limitations: This is a well -conducted systematic review with only minor limitations.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 2009 Apr 15;(2):CD003030 . 96 Summa ry of findings This updated review included 81 studies. Most studies were from Europe (34) and North America (32). Eleven studies were from low and middle -income countries. There was substantial variation in the complexity of the targeted behaviours, ba seline compliance, characteristics of the inverventions and results. 1) Educational meetings compared to no intervention The authors categorised the studies according to whether the educational meetings were interactive or didactic, the intensity of the e ducational meetings, attendance at the meetings, the complexity of the targeted behaviour, the seriousness of the outcome, and the level of baseline compliance. The effect appeared to be larger with higher attendance at the educational meetings. Educationa l meetings did not appear to be effective for complex behaviours and they appeared to be less effective for less serious outcomes. Educational meetings with or without other interventions probably improve compli- ance with desired practice and patient outco mes. The certainty of this evidence was moderate. Educational meetings with or without other interventions* compared to no intervention People Healthcare providers Settings Primary and secondary care Intervention Educational meetings with or without other interventions Comparison No intervention Outcomes Adjusted absolute improvement (risk difference) Median (Interquartile range) Certainty of the evidence (GRADE) Compliance with desired practice Median 6% (1.8% to 15.9%) Moderate to 4.0%) Moderate GRADE: GRADE Working Group grades of evidence (see above and last page) *Several studies tested multifaceted interventions. The most commonly used co -interventions were reminders, patient education material, suppo rtive services, feedback reports and educational outreach. The post intervention risk differences are adjusted for pre -intervention differences between the comparison groups. About the certainty of the evidence (GRADE) * High : It is very likely that the effect will be close to what was found in the research. Moderate: It is likely that the effec t will be close to what was found in the research, but there is a possibility that it will be substantially different. Low: It is likely that the effect will be substantially different from what was found in the research, but the research provides an in dication of what might be expected. Very low: The anticipated effect is very uncertain and the research does not provide a reliable indication of what might be expected. *This is sometimes referred to as 'quality of evidence' or 'confidence in the esti mate'. See last page for more information. 97 2) Educational meetings alone compared to no intervention Educational meetings alone probably improve compliance with desired practice and probably improve patient outcomes. The certainty of this evidence was moderate. 3) Interactive educational meetings compared to didactic (lecture based) educational meetings One trial that compared interactive educational meetings to didactic educational meetings was found that provided data. The aim of thi s study from Indonesia was to improve appropriate drug use in acute diarrhoea to prevent dehydration and death. Locally arranged interactive educational meetings were compared to didactic educational meetings arranged for all prescribers in a health distri ct. A slightly larger improvement was reported for the group receiving interactive education (adjusted risk difference 1.4%). The authors of the review categorised all the included studies according to whether the educational meetings were interactive or didactic and analysed the results to find out if this could explain the variations in effect among the studies. They found that interactive educational meetings alone were not consistently more effective than didactic educational meetings alone, but that i nterventions that they had categorised as mixed interactive and didactic educational meetings were more effective than either one alone. Interactive educational meetings may be slightly more effective than lecture -based meetings. Mixed interactive and did actic educational meetings may be more effective than only interactive or only didactic educational meetings. Educational meetings alone compared to no intervention People Healthcare providers Settings Primary and secondar y care Intervention Educational meetings without other interventions Comparison No intervention Outcomes Adjusted absolute improvement (risk difference)* Median (Interquartile range) Certainty of the evidence (GRADE) Compliance with desired practice Median 6% (2.9 to 15.3) Moderate Patient outcomes Median 3% (-0.9% to 4.0%) Moderate GRADE: GRADE Working Group grades of evidence (see above and last page) *The post intervention risk differences are adjusted for pre -intervention differences betwee n the comparison groups. 98 Additional information Related literature O'Brien MA, Freemantle N, Oxman AD, Wolf F, Davis DA, Herrin J.

Internet based learning is increasingly used in the training and ongo ing education of health professionals. Concerns about the effects of this medium of teaching and learning have stimulated a large body of research. This summary describes a review and meta -analysis of research on the effectiveness of internet based learni ng in health professions. Key messages Internet -based learning methods compared with no intervention may improve knowledge on health professionals, but it is not known whether they improve skills and behaviours of health professions learners, or if they lead to beneficial effects on patients. Practise exercises, tutorials, online discussions and longer duration courses may improve the effects of internet based learning on different outcomes It is not known whether Internet based learning in health profess ions when compared to other forms of teaching and learning may improve knowledge, satisfaction, skills, behaviour and effects on patients.

It permits learners to participate at a time and place convenient to them, facilitates innovation in instructional methods , and potentially allows instruction to be tailored to the individuals needs. Several studies have been unde rtaken to assess the effectiveness of internet -based learning. The use of internet learning at any stage in training or practice in health professions were included. The authors also sought to determine factors that could explain differences in effect acr oss participants, settings, interventions, outcomes and study designs. How this summary was prepared The methods used to assess the reliability of the review are described here: www.supportsummaries.org/methods Knowing what's not known is important A reliable review might not find any well-designed studies. Although that is disappointing, it is important to know what is not known as well as what is know n. A lack of evidence does not mean a lack of effects. It means the effects are uncertain.

JAMA . 2008;300(10):1181 -1196 (doi:10.1001/jama.300.10.1181) 102 Summary of findings Findings are reported separately for the two main comparisons; i.e. internet based learning compared to no intervention, and compared to non internet based le arning. Key findings of sub -analyses are also reported. 1) Internet based learning compared to no intervention Internet based learning was compared to no learning intervention for health professions. Satisfaction outcomes were not reported as no studies r eported meaningful outcomes of this type. Internet based learning may improve knowledge, but it is not known if they improve skills, behaviours and effects on patient care in health professions when com- pared to no intervention. Practise exercises may enhan ce skills acquisition, but not knowledge or behaviours Tutorials, longer duration courses and online peer discussions may improve behav- iours and effects on patient care About quality of evidence (GRADE) High : Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: Further research is very likely to have a n important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low: We are very uncertain about the estimate.

High interactivity, repetition, and online discussion were not associ- ated with larger effects. 16 studies (16 interventions) Very low Behaviours and effects on patient care There was a large effect on behaviours and effects in patient care ( pooled effect size 0.82; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.20). Tutorials, longer duration courses and online peer discussion were as- sociated with larger effects 19 studies of 32 interventions Very low *GRADE: GRADE Working Group grades of evidence (see above and last page ) CI: Confidence interval Standardized mean difference: Effects over 0.8 are considered large. 104 2) Internet based learning compared to non -internet based learning Internet based learning in health professions was compared to alternative instructional me dia, including face to face teaching and learning. It is not known whether Internet based learning improves knowledge, satisfaction, skills and behaviour when com- pared to non -internet based learning, or if it leads to beneficial effects in patients.

Short courses, and single instance rather than ongoing access in- ternet based interventions were associated with larger effects. 43 studies Very low Knowledge There was a very small positive effect of Internet -based methods (pooled effect size 0.12; 95% CI 0.003 to 0.24). Internet courses using online discussion and longer courses were associated wi th larger effects. 63 studies Very low Skills There were no differences between Internet and non -Inter- net based methods (pooled effect size 0.09; 95% CI -0.26 to 0.44). High levels of interactivity, practice exercises and peer discussion were asso ciated with larger effects. 12 studies Very low Behaviours and effects in patient care There were no differences between Internet and non -Inter- net based methods (pooled effect size 0.51; 95% CI -0.24 to 1.25).

Inter- professional educa tion has generated a great deal of interest amongst policymakers, educators and researchers as a mechanism for facilitating collaborative practices and improving professional practice and patient care. Interprofessional education has been defined as initia tives that involve more than one profession in joint, interactive learning with the explicit purpose of improving collaboration between professionals, as well as patient care and patient health and wellbeing. About the systematic review underlying this summary Review objective: To assess the effects of interprofessional education (IPE) on professional practice and healthcare outcomes Types of What the review authors searched for What the review authors found Study designs and Interventions Randomis ed controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time -series studies (ITS) of IPE interventions (all types of educational, training, learning or teaching initiatives, involving more than one profession in joint, inte ractive learning with the explicit purpose of improving interprofessional collaboration or the health and wellbeing of patients) 15 studies: 8 RCTs, 5 CBAs and 2 ITS. The IPE interventions assessed were varied, and included (among others): communication skills training, teamwork and team planning interven- tions, and behaviour change training (interactive workshops). Participants Health and social care professionals A range of health and social care professionals including (among others): physicians, n urses, nutritionists, optometrists, social workers, physician assistants, psychiatrists, mental health workers, medicine residents, phar- macy students, obstetricians and anaesthetists Settings Not specified Countries: USA (12), UK (2), Mexico (1) Healt h care settings: hospital emergency departments, community men- tal health provider organisations, primary care clinics, and a health maintenance organisations Outcomes Objectively measured or self reported patient/client out- comes, healthcare process outc omes Patient outcomes, guideline adherence rates, patient satisfaction, clinical process outcomes, collaborative behaviour, medical error rates, practitioner competencies Date of most recent search: August 2011 Limitations: This is a well conducted r eview with only minor limitations Reeves S, Perrier L, Goldman J, Freeth D, Zwarenstein M.

When there is a lack of evidence, consider ation should be given to monitoring and evaluating the effects of the intervention, if it is used. 109 Summary of f indings This review included 15 studies assessing the effectiveness of IPE interventions compared to no educational interventions. The studies varied in terms of the objectives and format of the educational intervention, the presence of other interventio ns in addition to the ed- ucational intervention, and the clinical areas and settings in which the interventions were delivered. The IPE component in these studies ranged from a few hours or days to longitu- dinal programmes that were delivered over one year o r more. Interprofessional education may lead to improved outcomes for patients and greater patient satisfaction. The certainty of this evidence was low Interprofessional education may improve the adherence of different professionals to guidelines or standa rds. The certainty of this evidence was low Interprofessional education may improve clinical processes (e.g. shared decisions on surgical incisions). The certainty of this evidence was low There is insufficient data to adequately assess whether interprofes sional education improves the competencies (e.g. skills, knowledge) of professionals to work to- gether in the delivery of care. The certainty of this evidence was very low There is insufficient data to adequately assess whether interprofessional education r e- duces errors in medical practice. The certainty of this evidence was very low About the certainty of the evidence (GRADE) * High : It is very likely that the effect will be close to what was found in the research. Moderate: It is likely that the effect will be close to what was found in the research, but there is a possibility that it will be substantially different. Low: It is likely that the effect will be substantially different from what was found in the research, but the research provides an indication of what might be expected. Very low: The anticipated effect is very uncertain and the research does not provide a reliable indication of what might be expected. *This is sometimes referred to as 'quality of evidence' or 'confidence in the estimate'.

The Cochrane database of systematic reviews. 2012;10:CD004398. 113 January 2014 - SUPPORT Summary of a systematic review What are the effects of printed educational materials on professional practice and healthcare outcomes? Printed educational materials (PEMs), including clinical guidelines, monographs and publications in peer -reviewed journals, are common channels to distribute recommen- dations for clinical care and evidence to inform the practice of heal thcare providers. PEMs are used across a range of settings as a strategy to improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes through promoting clinical practices that have been shown to be beneficial and discouraging the use of ineffective interventio ns. The wide use of PEMs in many settings, particularly in the form of clinical guidelines, is linked to the fact that they are seen as familiar, accessible, relatively inexpensive and convenient . Key messages When used alone, printed educational materia ls may slightly improve practice out- comes among health care providers, compared to no intervention The effects of printed educational materials on patient outcomes are uncertain be- cause the quality of the evidence is very low Of the 45 studies included in the review, 44 were from high income countries. Rigor- ous studies from low income countries are needed to assess the impacts of printed educational materials on professional practice in these settings Who is this summary for?

PEMs have the poten- tial to improve the care received by patients by promoting clinical practices and inter- ventions of proven benefit and discour aging ineffective practices or interventions. Key questions regarding the use of PEMs to improve professional practice and patient out- comes include: (1) the effects of the use of PEMs compared to no intervention; (2) how the effects of PEMs are influenced by their characteristics, e.g. mode of delivery, source of information, and format; and (3) the role of health systems wide considerations, in- cluding, human resource challenges, lack of required inputs and inadequate funding.

About the systematic review underlying this summary Review objective: To determine the effec ts of printed educational materials in improving professional practice and patient outcomes Types of What the review authors searched for What the review authors found Study designs & Interventions Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non -ran- domised cont rolled trials (NRCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs), and inter- rupted time series studies (ITS) assessing the effects of printed educational materials, such as clinical practice guidelines, journals, and monographs, delivered personally, throu gh mass mailing or passively via wider channels such as the internet or mass media. 45 studies: 8 cluster -randomised controlled trials, 6 randomised controlled trials, and 31 interrupted time series studies. Most studies (36/45) evalu- ated a single PEM. Two studies evaluated simultaneously several PEMs (re- spectively 12 and 11 distinct PEMs) that presented similar characteristics; and three interrupted time series (ITS) studies assessed more than two or three PEMs with very similar characteristics.

Cochrane database of systematic reviews 2011 (9): CD008451. 118 March 2015 - SUPPO RT Summary of a systematic review Do financial incentives improve the quality of health care provided by primary care physicians? The use of financial incentives to directly reward performance and quality has been proposed as a strategy to improve the quality of care provided by primary care physicians. An increasing number of countries, like the USA and UK, use financial incentives. Key messages The effects of financial incentives to improve the quality of health ca re provided by primary care physicians is uncertain. If financial incentives for quality improvement are used, they should be carefully de- signed and evaluated. Unintended consequences and economic consequences should be evaluated, as well as impacts on the quality of care and access to care.

Payments can be made in exchange for different outputs, including: working for a specified time period (salary), providing specific services (fee-for-service), providing care for a specific population (capitation), or providing a pre -specified level of quality of care (pay for performance). Payments can also be unconditional, for each additional output, or they can be conditional on reaching a threshold or target. Payments can also be prospective (providing a fixed budget) or retrospective. With retrospective payments, there may or may not be a cap. The level of payment for primary physicians can also vary in several ways. The level can be fix ed in advance, physicians can have varying degrees of discretion as to the amount of money they can charge, and the amount of payment can be reduced or withheld if physicians do not comply with what is required (financial penalties). The amount of payment can also vary depending on administrative rules (e.g. depending on qualifications of the physicians, where they practice, or the types of patients they see). Changes in any of these characteristics of how physicians are paid or the level of payment alters their financial incentives. If physicians respond to these changes in incentives, it can affect the quality of the care that they provide.

About t he systematic review underlying this summary Review objective: To examine the effect of changes in the method and level of payment on the quality of care pro- vided by primary care physi cians (PCPs) Types of What the review authors searched for What the r eview authors found Study designs & Interventions Randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before and after studies (CBA), and interrupted time series analyses (ITS) evaluating the impact of changes in the method or level of payment for primary car e physicians 7 studies were included: 3 cluster RCTs; 2 CBA; 1 ITS; and 1 con - trolled ITS. 3 studies evaluated single -threshold target pay- ments, 1 examined a fixed fee per patient achieving a specified outcome, 1 evaluated payments based on the relative ra nking of medical groups' performance (tournament -based pay), 1 study examined a mix of tournament -based pay and threshold pay- ments, and 1 study evaluated changing from a blended pay- ments scheme to salaried payment. Participants Primary care physicians (PC Ps) 5 US studies took place in large private health plans, the UK study in 20 PCP medical groups in England, and the German study in 82 medical practices. Settings Primary care The studies were from US (5), the UK (1), Germany (1). Outcomes Quality of c are was defined as patient reported outcome measures, clinical behaviours, and in- termediate clinical and physiological measures 3 studies examined smoking cessation; 1 patients' assessment of the quality of care; 2 cervical cancer screening, mammography screening, and HbA1 (1 of them also childhood immunisation, chlamydia screening, and appropriate asthma medication); and 1 four outcomes in diabetes.

Cochrane database of systematic reviews 2011 (9): CD008451. 120 Summary of findings Seven studies were included in this review. Three of the studies evaluated single - threshold t arget payments, one examined a fixed fee per patient achieving a specified outcome, one study evaluated payments based on the relative ranking of medical groups' performance (tournament -based pay), one study examined a mix of tournament -based pay and thres hold payments, and one study evaluated changing from a blended payments scheme to salaried payment. Six out of the seven studies used schemes that paid medical groups rather than individual physicians. For those studies that involved payments to medical gr oups, none reported how the payments were used or distributed within the medical group. Outcome measures included targeted preventive interventions (support for smoking cessation, screening, immunizations) and management goals for chronic conditions (asthma and diabetes). Six of the seven studies showed positive but modest effects on quality of care for some primary outcome measures, but not all. Physicians were able to select into or out of the incentive schemes or health plans and there was a high risk of bias in all of the studies. The effects of financial incentives on the quality of health care provided by primary care physicians is uncertain because of very low certainty of the evidence. About the certainty of the evidence (GRADE) * High : This research provid es a very good indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect will be substantially different is low. Moderate: This research provides a good indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect will be substantially differe nt is moderate. Low: This research provides some indication of the likely effect. However, the likelihood that it will be substantially different is high. Very low: This research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The like lihood that the effect will be substantially different is very high. * This is sometimes referred to as 'quality of evidence' or 'confidence in the estimate'.

Interprofessional collaboration: effects of practice -based interventions on professional practice and healthcare outcomes. The Cochrane database of systematic reviews. 2009(3):CD000072. 124 January 2014 - SUPPORT Summary of a systematic review Do healthcare teams improve professional practice or pa tient outcomes? Interprofessional collaboration is the process by which two or more health or social care professionals work together to improve the delivery of healthcare and health outcomes. Practice -based interventions to promote interprofessional coll aboration (i.e. better work interactions and teamworking among providers) in healthcare delivery are intended to respond to the needs of restructuring, reorganisation, and cost containment, and to the increasing complexity of healthcare knowledge and work. Key messages We are uncertain whether practice -based interventions to improve collaboration between professionals lead to improvements in professional collaboration or in patient and healthcare outcomes because the quality of the evidence is very low We are uncertain whether practice -based interventions to improve collaboration between professionals decrease health care costs because the quality of the evidence is very low The studies included in the review were very different from each other in terms of the types of professionals included, the tasks performed, the degree of interaction, and the populations and health issues considered. Who is this summary for? People making decisions about the implementation of interventions to foster or improve interprofessional collaboration in healthcare. This summary includes: Key findings from research based on a systematic review Not included: Recommendations Additional evidence not included in the systematic review Detailed descriptions of interventions or their implementation This summary is based on the following systematic review: Zwarenstein M, Goldman J, Reeves S.

Such collaboration is widely promoted on the assumption that how well healthcare providers work together will impact on their performance and therefore on health care quality. This summary is based on a systematic revi ew focusing on interventions introduced to a practice setting with the explicit objective of improving collaboration between two or more health and/or social care professionals (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors/physicians, pharmacists, physiotherapists, psyc hologists, and social workers). How this summary was prepared The methods used to a ssess the reliability of the review are described here: www.supportsummaries.org/methods Knowing what is not known is important A reliable review might not find any well-designed studies. Although th is may be disappointing, it is important to know what is not known as well as what is known. A lack of evidence does not mean a lack of effects. It means the effects are uncertain. When there is a lack of evidence, consideration should be given to monito ring and evaluating the effects of the intervention, if it is used. About the systematic review underlying this summary Review objective: To assess the impact of practice -based interventions to improve collaboration between professionals on patient sat isfaction, effectiveness and the efficiency of the healthcare provided. What the review authors searched for What the review authors found Study designs and Interventions RCTs (randomised clinical trials) which evaluate practice -based interventions tha t are designed to improve collaboration between two or more health and/or social care professionals. 5 RCTs evaluating: interprofessional rounds (2 studies), interprofessional meetings (2), and externally facilitated interprofessional audit (1). Particip ants Healthcare teams composed of more than one type of health and social care professional, in any patient population. Teams involving a combination of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists/dietitians, social workers, case managers, physical therapi sts, speech pathologists, occupational therapists, service support staff and managers. Settings Any healthcare setting Acute care or general hospital care (3), telemetry unit of a community hospital [technology that allows remote measurement and reporting of information] (1), nursing home (1). Country settings: United States of America (USA) (2), United Kingdom (UK) (1), Australia (1) and Sweden (1). Outcomes Patient/client health measures (e.g. mortality, cure rates); healthcare process outcomes (e.g. readmission rates, continuity of care, use of resources; patient or family satisfaction; interprofessional collaboration.) All studies reported some outcome of patient/client or healthcare process outcome. Only one study provided an adequate evaluation of i nterprofessional collaboration.

BMC Health Serv Res. 2011; 11: 211. 132 Summary of f indings The review included nine before -after studies. Most studies (eight) were done in North America and one study was done in eight countries (Canada, Jordan, India, New Zealand, Philippines, Tanzania, United Kingdom and United States). Four clinical settings were covered: five studies in the intensive care unit, two studies in the emergency department, one study in surgery, and one study in multi -departmental acute care. 1) Intensive care unit setting Five studies conducted in the United States evaluate d checklists in the intensive care unit setting. All studies had a hight risk of bias, and given the important methodological differences between them, they can not be summarised quantitatively. It is uncertain whether checklists improve adherence to recom mended practice or pa- tient outcomes in the intensive care units because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Intensive care unit setting People: Healthcare professionals Settings: Acute hospitals Intervention: Paper -based checklists Comparison: Ca re provided without checklists Outcomes Impact Number of studies Certainty of the evidence (GRADE) Length of stay Different checklists were used among studies. One of the studies found a reduction in the length of stay, but the other two did not. 3 Very low Percentage of ventilation days on which patient received four care process (Prophylaxis of peptic ulcer d isease and deep venous thrombosi s, appropriate sedation and recumbent positioning) During the period that the surgical checklist was use d, the compliance in the four processes improved from 30% to 96% (p <0.001) 1 Very low Improvement in four domains (Use of physical therapy, transfer to telemetry, time from admission to the prescription of medical deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, and central catheter duration) The use of the checklist was associated with an improvement in two of the four domains. 1 Very low GRADE: GRADE Working Group grades of evidence (see above and last page) About the certainty of the evidence (GRADE) * High : This research provides a very good indication of the likely effect.

Substantially different = a large enough difference that it might affect a decision See last page for more information. 133 2) Emergency department setting Two studies e valuated checklists in the emergency department. The included studies have a hight risk of bias and they could not be summarised quantitatively. It is uncertain whether checklists improve adherence to recommended practice or patient outcomes in the emerg ency departments because the certainty of the evidence is very low. 3) Surgery setting One study conducted in eight countries (Canada, Jordan, India, New Zealand, Philip pines, Tanzania, United Kingdom and United States) evaluated checklists in the surgery setting (7688 patients undergoing non -cardiac surgery). Checklists may improve the death rate and major complications within the first 30 days after an opera- tion. The certainty of this evidence was low.

These desires are shared among many stakeholder, such as consumers, health care professionals and policymakers. Reporting of performance can be done in many ways, e.g. through consumer reports, provider profiles, or report cards. It is often assumed that the release of such information will affect the behaviours of the various stakeholder, and ultimately lead to health system improvements.

Types of What the review authors s earched for What the review authors found Study designs & Interventions Randomised controlled trials , quasi ran- domised trials , interrupted time series, and controlled before -after studies of the release of performance data into the public domain, on any aspect of health care. Two cluster randomised trials, one quasi cluster ran- domised trial, and one interrupted time series study. Participants Healthcare consumers or providers, in- cluding organisations . Consumers (including families) (3 studies) and hospi- tals (1) Settings Not pre -specified USA (3 studies) and Canada (1) Outcomes Utilisation decisions (by consumers, pro- fessionals, organisations, or purchasers) . Provider performance, staff morale and behaviour. Choice of health plan (2 studies) or hospital (1 study) among consumers. Process of care -indicators for acute myocardial infarc- tion and congestive heart failure, and quality im- provement activities (1 study). Date of most recent search: Early 2011 Limitations: This is a well-conducted systematic r Public release of performance data in changing the behaviour of healthcare consumers, professionals or organisations. Cochrane Database of Systematic Re views 2011, Issue 11. Art. No.: CD004538. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004538.pub2 139 Summary of findings The review included four studies comparing the release of performance data, with not releasing such data. Two studies were in health plan settings (USA), and two in hospital settings (USA and Canada). The three US -studies assessed the impact on consumer behaviour (choice of health plan or hospital), and the Canadian study measured whether pu blic reporting influenced provider behaviour. Public release of performance data may not influence consumers' selection of health plan or hospital Public release of performance data may lead to little or no difference in process of care indicators, but ma y lead to more quality improvement activities Effect of public release of performance data People: Patients treated for acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, or given coronary artery bypass graft or discec- tomy surgery, and Medica id enrolees Settings: Health plans or hospitals Intervention: Release of performance data (risk adjusted outcomes, consumer reports (CAHPS), composite and individual indicators) Comparison: No release of performance data Outcomes Impact Certainty of the evidence (GRADE) Changes in selection Public release of performance data may not influence consumers' selection of health plan or hospital Low Changes in care Public release of performance data may lead to little or no difference in process of care indicators, but may lead to more quality improvement activities Low GRADE: GRADE Working Group grades of evidence (see above and last page) About the certainty of the evidence (GRADE) * High : It is very likely that the effect will be close to what was found in the research. Moderate: It is likely that the effe ct will be close to what was found in the research, but there is a possibility that it will be substantially different. Low: It is likely that the effect will be substantially different from what was found in the research, but the research provides an i ndication of what might be expected. Very low: The anticipated effect is very uncertain and the research does not provide a reliable indication of what might be expected. *This is sometimes referred to as 'quality of evidence' or 'confidence in the est imate'.

By \"substanti ally different\" we mean a large enough difference that it might affect a decision . These judgements are made using the GRADE system, and are provided for each outcome. The judgements are based on the study design (randomised trials versus observational stu dies), factors that reduce the certainty (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias) and factors that increase the certainty (a large effect, a dose response relationship, and plausible confounding). For each outcome, th e certainty of the evidence is rated as high, moderate, low or very low using the definitions on page 3.
