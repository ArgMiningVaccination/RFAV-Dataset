[US Food and Drug Administration] Sourcing quality supplements at a glance Separate from whether a supplement or natural products provides medical benefit, quality may be an issue. In many places, including the USA, supplements are not monitored and regulated well. Safety is often not reviewed before a product goes on the market. Product names can be very confusing, with the same product sold under several names. Different products may also have similar names. Natural products are inherently difficult to standardize. Doses of active ingredients can vary substantially from one brand to another, or even from one batch to the next. Product quality and potency depend on using the right part of the plant or substance and following careful safeguards. Some products lose (or gain) potency over time. All of this makes the quality of natural products difficult to control as a manufacturer and to assess as a consumer. Researchers have found that some products may contain substantially less\u2014or even none\u2014of the active ingredient listed on the label. Some products may be contaminated with substances that aren't listed on the label and that may even be unsafe. Several independent [rating services ](#find) rate the quality of supplements. Why is quality an issue? Lack of regulation Supplements and natural products are not monitored and regulated well. In the USA, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is not authorized to review supplements before being marketed to assure they perform as claimed or even that they are safe to use. The FDA does have the authority to take dietary supplements off the market if they are found to be unsafe or if the claims on the products are false and misleading, but this happens only after products are available to consumers.

Lack of standardization Knowing what's in that bottle or package of a natural product can be difficult: [2]Block KI. [Life over Cancer: The Block Center Program for Integrative Cancer Treatment](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/14959/life-over-cancer-by-keith-i-block-md-foreword-by-andrew-weil-md/). New York: Bantam Dell. 2009. - Multiple names may be used for a product. For example, the names artemisinin, annual wormwood, qing hao, qinghaosu, sweet annie, sweet sagewort and sweet wormwood are all used for the same herb. - Different products may be labeled with similar names. \"ALA\" may mean either alpha lipoic acid or alpha linoleic acid, for instance. - Products need to contain the correct plant part\u2014root, leaf, bark, pollen, seed, fruit, flower or the whole plant\u2014to be effective. Low-quality supplements may not include the therapeutic part, or it may have been harvested at the wrong time, or it may not have been processed appropriately. Natural products may not be manufactured to precise specifications. They're natural products, after all. Fish oil doesn't naturally always contain all the same components in exactly the same proportions, for example. Several variables can affect the composition of a product, even from the same species: growing conditions, soil or water composition and quality, timing of harvest, drying method, length of storage, packing materials, and exposure to moisture or heat. Because products in nature are not standardized, a product's potency is difficult to control. Supplements may contain far less or more of the active ingredient than the label states, even without any intent to mislead by the manufacturer. Some supplements deteriorate over time or may have a change in potency from exposure to air, light, moisture, or heat. Check packages for expiration dates regularly\u2014each time you use products that you take only occasionally. Store supplements and products as recommended by the manufacturers. High moisture levels in bathrooms make them poor places to store many products. [3]Block KI.

New York: Bantam Dell. 2009. Lack of active ingredients Studies have found that some supplements have undetectable levels\u2014essentially zero\u2014of the active ingredient you're trying to buy.

Contamination Besides the intended product, what other substances are in that pill, powder or liquid? Several investigations have found undisclosed\u2014and sometimes unsafe\u2014contaminants in supplements and herbal products. Contaminants can include bacteria, fungi, heavy metals, pesticides, other chemicals, and pharmaceutical agents (drugs). [5]Newmaster SG, Grguric M, Shanmughanandhan D, Ramalingam S, Ragupathy S.

Some contaminants are intentionally added (especially with herbs from Asia), some reflect poor quality control, and yet others show cost-saving approaches that disregard your well-being as a consumer. Over several years, persistent reports have surfaced of contamination of some herbal remedies by microbes, heavy metals, and/or DNA of undeclared plants or animals\u2014sometimes a substantial percentage of those tested.
