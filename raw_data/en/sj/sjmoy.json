Balance is a powerful combination featuring fresh conifers from Canada - Douglas Fir and Fir Balsam, along with our most popular Maritime Pine with its balsamic yet fresh, coniferous woody pine scent for injecting a comforting and grounding quality. These three conifers, when combined with Peru Balsam, Lavender, and Clary Sage, form a grounding foundation. We then added sweet fresh elements from Elemi and Spearmint to bring a pleasant and uplifting aroma. The penultimate addition, our exquisite Damiana essential oil, was selected to equalize emotions thereby assisting to reduce instances of anxiety through its ability to increase neurotransmitter production including serotonin and dopamine. Finally, we graced the blend with a touch of Magnolia Blossom because of its aroma-therapeutic benefit for calming the nervous system. Dilution: Balance blend is 100% pure essential oil and not intended for use neat on skin. For perfumery or skin products blend with one of our premium quality carrier oils. For perfume we suggest [Jojoba Clear](https://www.lgbotanicals.com/product.asp?itemid=781) or [Fractionated Coconut Oil](https://www.lgbotanicals.com/product.asp?itemid=350) . Both are clear, odorless, and economical. Refer to our [dilution charts](https://www.lgbotanicals.com/infopage.asp?page=47) to calculate ratios.
