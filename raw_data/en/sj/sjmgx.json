One of its high-flying witches is my guest. Hello, and welcome to Witch, Fiona Horne, on The New Believers, leading the spiritual revolution, here on The Spirit of Things, ABC Radio National. I'm Rachael Kohn. MUSIC Rachael Kohn: From devout Catholic to Rock Chick and Witch, Fiona Horne has had a few incarnations, but her taste for the outrageous hasn't left her. Since the days when she dressed up as Miffy Todwallop and Azaria Starwoman in her Rock Band, DefFX, she's loved costume and performance, and being a witch for about 14 years now has given her ample opportunity for both. But Fiona Horne is also a writer, and she's produced four books on witchcraft, one of them for teens, who make up a growing number of followers of this new-old religion. No surprise, given the popularity of TV programs like Charmed, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Above all, Fiona is relaxed about her witchcraft, she's not interested in pushing a new 'orthodoxy', and is happy to promote a popular, fun, and practical approach to pagan spirituality. I spoke to her in Los Angeles where she now spends most of her time. Fiona Horne, welcome to The Spirit of Things. Fiona Horne: Thank you very much. Rachael Kohn: Fiona, it's a long way from the days when you thought being a witch was something you had to hide; isn't being a witch now one of the coolest things to be? Fiona Horne: Amongst a certain demographic I suppose, young teenagers particularly are drawn to it I think because of the images they see on television like Buffy and Sabrina and Charmed, and people like myself who work in the entertainment industry and also actively and openly say they practice witchcraft. But I think qualifying the interest, it is the fastest growing religion pretty much in the Western world. I mean there was a recent census done in Australia, and reports done here, of which I have some figures in front of me, some reports done in the US that indicate the same phenomenon. Rachael Kohn: Well I imagine that parents whose kids are watching programs like Charmed and Buffy don't actually realise that their kids could easily become a witch by simply buying books such as the ones that you've published, like Life's a Witch: A Handbook for Teen Witches. So is it the case that teens are actually interested in becoming witches? Fiona Horne: I think so, I think they're fascinated by what they see on television, this glamorous and exotic and exciting image of someone, particularly female, because most of the teens drawn to witchcraft are female, but they see this fabulous image on television who can do these incredible things, have control over their lives and create magic and change, and they obviously feel drawn to that, and as teenagers it's natural to feel a sense of looking for a place in the world to inhabit, a sense of self and a sense of purpose, and that's where witchcraft speaks very strongly to them. When I wrote Life's a Witch, it was to answer those questions. I'd written a few books prior to the Life's a Witch book, and I was getting so much feedback from teens saying, This is great, we're very interested in this, we want to know more about specific things to do with us, like are there spells I can do to help me get through school better, or to do better in a test, or I'm really nervous about it, my first date, or my first kiss, is there a spell or a ritual or something I can do that will make me feel more confident? And those sort of queries inspired me to write Life's a Witch. Rachael Kohn: Well your books are certainly full of recipes for hexes and spells. Is that how you learned to be a witch? Is it something that's self-taught? Fiona Horne: Well I have to correct you there, Rachael, if you don't mind. There's not recipes for hexes. Hexes and spells, you don't really need to bracket them in the same thing like that. A hex is when you wilfully cause harm to someone else using magical and practical means, and I don't encourage that whatsoever in my books, discuss the role hexing plays in witchcraft, but I don't advocate it as an appropriate course of action necessarily. And certainly in my teen witch book I make it very clear to the teenagers that it's a far greater show of power to heal and help, and express a sentiment of love in the world, than it is to hurt and harm. Rachael Kohn: Could you just give an example of one of the spells that you might teach a teen who wants to get through a test? Fiona Horne: Well there's one in the book that I like. Generally spell-casting, any sort of spell-casting, regardless of the problem, involves certain affirmations or magical charms or enchantments to say, certain objects, like crystals and herbs that have an inherent energy or power attached to them that is aligned to the purpose of the spell, and then I usually suggest that the spell be conducted at a certain time, like a certain phase of the moon, perhaps waxing or waning or full, or dark, all these sort of alignments are I guess like magnets that can further fuel, further draw your intent to you. So a spell for studying would involve using the quartz crystal citrine, which is aligned to intellectual sort of powers, it can magnify intellectual powers, and herbs like rosemary, which is a mental stimulant, and there's a bit of practical information about that, in the sense that you think of rosemary is always worn on Anzac Day, it's the herb of remembrance. So rosemary in a folklore sense and in a magical and in a medicinal sense, has a role to play in encouraging clear thought. And so I incorporate that into the spell too. And generally I think what I suggest in that teen one, was to have a cup of rosemary tea in the morning, charm your citrine quartz by the light of a candle so that it embodies the essence of fire which is a very powerful transformative element, and carry that crystal with you into your test, have it on your desk as a visual reminder of your intent to do well, and to have confidence that you can do well, and also to help you think clearly. Rachael Kohn: So it's pretty out there in the open. If you were a teenager with a quartz crystal on your desk, you'd have to be prepared to explain it to your teacher. But can I ask you what you define as, or how you would define what a witch is? Fiona Horne: I have a very simple summation I guess of what a witch is. A witch is a person, male or female, who honours nature as being sacred, who recognises that there's a God, and a Goddess, particularly the Goddess plays a very omnipresent role in our religion, and a witch is also someone who believes they can do spells and magic and create change, and does ritual work, ritualises elements of their life to have a magical appreciation of life. Rachael Kohn: Well Fiona, you've been a pretty creative witch, and I gather you're not so caught up with the official history, or should I say herstory, of Wicca. Why not? Fiona Horne: I think witchcraft is a new religion that's evolving now, and it's eclectic, it draws on a lot of the knowledge and practices and beliefs of different cultures from all over the world, and I think it reflects, in a sense, the fact that we live in an information age where a lot of this information is available, and the religion itself I think is evolving to answer the questions that people are asking now, which is why it is so relevant now. It doesn't make it any less meaningful to me that we don't have a bible that's, you know, how old's the bible, 2000 years old, not even that really is it? Rachael Kohn: It depends on which bible you're talking about, the Old Testament, or... Fiona Horne: Yes, the New Testament or the Old Testament, exactly. But I guess my point being is that every religion has to start somewhere. I think Wicca is evolving as a religion now, and it's drawing on what humans have learnt from the past, and I think that's very positive. Rachael Kohn: Well Fiona, you write about your early life as a devout Catholic. Was it in Melbourne? Fiona Horne: No, I was born in Sydney. I grew up in Sydney, I moved to Melbourne a few years ago before moving to America. Rachael Kohn: Right. Well you say that you used to go to church, but now you carry your church in your heart, and can set up an altar anywhere, and be your own priestess. Do you think you got a taste for doing it yourself by watching the priests and the altar boys in the Catholic church? Fiona Horne: That was my favourite pastime. When I was a teenager it was watching the altar boys because I fancied one of them. But certainly I was fascinated by what was going on down the front of the church, the beautiful chalice and the incense, you know this incense censor, and I loved the big holy days where the priest would bring out that swinging rosemary. I think it was rosemary and frankincense in it perhaps, that the swinging censor of incense, and I just found it all so beautiful and evocative, that ritual going on. But what was actually being said didn't make much sense to me at all. Rachael Kohn: Did it disturb you that there were no women involved in this ritual process? Fiona Horne: Well when I was old enough to consciously question it, yes, absolutely. I remember being very excited when my favourite nun, Sister Geraldine, read one of the, you know in the early part of the mass there's the reading from the bible, and I thought it was so cool to see her up there. But that made me question, Well why aren't there any women up there? And around that time I was hitting puberty, and my own sexuality was awakening and I became very conscious of the negative messages that were continually reinforced in the Catholic faith that women were essentially unclean and the source of all sin. And it just didn't make any sense to me. And then I had a priest say to me that babies come from between two places of filth, the anus and the urethra. Rachael Kohn: Goodness! Fiona Horne: Rachael Kohn: Indeed. Fiona Horne: And then actually I read the Children's Living Bible, which I was given for my first communion when I was seven, it was either my confirmation or my communion, and I decided to read it when I was in my teens, I'd never read it, it was just on my bookshelf. And in Genesis, this interpretation of the Children's Living Bible in Genesis said women are doomed to bed children in pain and suffering to atone for the sins of Eve, and that struck me as rather depressing, too. Rachael Kohn: So I guess the goddess religion, the focus on the goddess in Wicca must have been an important opening for you to reconnect to your body? Fiona Horne: It was just very exciting to sort of discover that there was a way of looking at the world where women could be considered divine and a positive expression of the life force empowered, and beautiful, and divine and sacred, and that our sexuality was something to be upheld as an expression of that. And that was very exciting for me. And also, when I started looking to Wicca, I started looking into other religions too, and I was really drawn to Kali, the Hindu goddess of birth and destruction, and I thought she was really cool in the sense that she would devour the heads of any man that crossed her. I think when you're an agitated teenager you look for any kind of hope that your inner turmoil can be, I don't know, made sense of in some way. Rachael Kohn: I get the impression that Wicca has been a source of empowerment, the idea of a strong goddess is very attractive. Fiona Horne: Definitely. I think what drew me to performing in a band for so many years, I mean when I formed my first band it was a punk group, an all-girl punk group, and I used to play guitar and sing, and I just loved the fact that I could get up on stage and be the boss and scream at everyone. And that was a good thing, you know, I was cool. Because I was a Rock Chick. And I think when you just say 'strong goddess', I felt like a goddess on stage, I felt like a female who was on top of the world, you know. MUSIC Rachael Kohn: That's 'Magick' performed by Fiona Horne with her band, DefFX from the CD, 'Magick'. You're listening to Witch, Fiona Horne on the New Believers, our monthly series on The Spirit of Things. The popular image of witchcraft is that its sexual practices are uninhibited, to say the least. I put the question to Fiona Horne. Are there any sexual taboos in witchcraft? Fiona Horne: There's three basic laws of witchcraft: do what you want, as long as you don't hurt anyone; do what you want, as long as you don't interfere with anyone else's freewill, and as you send out, so returns threefold, which means be aware that everything you do will have a reaction, it will have an effect and an equal and opposite reaction, to a degree. But as far as having an open attitude towards sexuality, I think Wicca has a really healthy attitude towards sexuality in that it's an expression of a life force, it's not something to consider shameful or to be debased in any way, and so the usual ways that people would interpret sexual modesty don't really apply when it comes to witchcraft; we have a lot less hang-ups about sex than a lot of the other major world religions. Rachael Kohn: I wonder if the sexual dimension of witchcraft is the reason why it's so popular, particularly in your generation, a generation that virtually threw the suburban bedroom doors open to teen sex. Fiona Horne: I sort of describe this in my books, but teen witches, and especially the kids that I'm talking to that are really drawn to it and are really educating themselves about it and not just putting a pentacle on and saying, I'm cool, I'm a witch, but the ones that really look into it and are really learning about it have a very healthy attitude towards their sexuality and they're not promiscuous and they're not exploiting their emerging sexual selves, they're just confident and comfortable in their skin, and making decisions based on what they want to do and how they feel, rather than peer group pressure, which I think is very positive because witchcraft really does foster a strong sense of self, and you decide what you want to do. Now if you want to go off and have sex with the boy that you're in love with, or the girl that you're in love with or that you think that you're in love with, or that you've got a crush on, or that you just want to have sex with, great, go and do it, do what you want to do, but do it in an educated sense for your own reasons and not because you want to impress others or you feel you need to fit in. Rachael Kohn: Well speaking of that, you have a whole book on magickal sex, and I found it very romantic. Fiona Horne: Well the book was inspired by a television show I had in the United Kingdom last year where people from all over the country wrote to me with various questions to do with their love and sex lives, and I was quite overwhelmed with the response we got from men saying that they wanted their female lovers or wives, or whatever, to feel more loved and more confident in themselves sexually, and a lot of the rituals explore those ideas of how to make your lover feel like a goddess or a god, and I guess there is a sense of the romantic about that, absolutely, and using beautiful objects of nature that witches work with, whether it's flowers or essential oils or candles and incense and all those lovely sensual things that can enhance lovemaking at the best of times, and even more so when you do magic with them. But I've had a really positive response to the books. I think everyone, warning signs go up when they see it and then they read it, and they go Hang on, this is gorgeous, and it's actually fun and it seems to work too, so it's good. Rachael Kohn: Yes well you may be starting another sexual revolution. In fact you're there in Los Angeles where really witchcraft got under way in a big way in the '60s and '70s and where some very famous witches started, and Starhawk comes to mind. Have you met her? Fiona Horne: I haven't met her, but her book The Spiral Dance is one of the first books I read about witchcraft, and funnily enough, it's weird, because before I saw her book or knew anything about her, it was only probably a month before, I wrote a song in my old band DefFX and called it The Spiral Dance, and that title came to me very spontaneously from a dream that I'd had, and the lyrics sort of reflect that dream, lyrically it's pretty much the dream. And one of the lines in it is 'Magic wells up inside of me until it overflows, cascading down my cheeks. Starring-eyed I'm spinning slowly a spiral dance', and it was like a sense in my dream, I was spinning in my dream, not purposely but just standing and automatically I guess, spontaneously spinning and my head was thrown back and I had liquid crystal pouring out of my mouth and out of my eyes and I opened my eyes and everything was just dimensions of light and colour and it was so beautiful, and I called the song Spiral Dance, and then I saw her book on a bookshelf about a month later and I read it, and it was everything that dream was to me. Rachael Kohn: Yes, synchronicity. Fiona Horne: mentors? Fiona Horne: Well certainly Ly Warren-Clarke who now goes under the name Ly de Angeles. She wrote the first book I ever read on witchcraft specifically written in the Southern Hemisphere, in those days it was called The Way of the Goddess, and now it's been repackaged and republished as Witchcraft: Theory and Practice by Llewellyn publishers. Ly, I interviewed her for my first book in Australia, Witch: A Personal Journey, and she was a phenomenally inspirational woman. She's been practising the craft for a very long time, lives in Byron Bay now, I'm pretty sure she still lives up there. She wrote, probably I think it might have been the first book written for witches in the Southern Hemisphere, because when you're in the Southern Hemisphere, you practice witchcraft a little different to those in the north because of where you are in the planet, because witchcraft is a nature-worshipping, nature-honouring religion, where you are matters, like as to which way you face when you do things, and which way the sun moves across the sky, whether it appears to describe a clockwise arc or an anticlockwise arc, you have to be aware of all these things when working magic, and Lyse book addressed that, so she was like my first real inspiration. And then I guess Starhawk after that, I really love The Spiral Dance. MUSIC 'Spiral Dance' Rachael Kohn: Fiona Horne singing 'Spiral Dance', the song she wrote as a young witch, for her band DefFX. She's my guest on The New Believers. Born and raised in Sydney, she now lives in California, where witchcraft first became a major feminist movement in the '70s. Are you involved at all in the Wiccan scene in Los Angeles? Fiona Horne: I do regular talks at The Bodhi Tree, which is a very popular bookstore on Melrose Avenue, a bit of a touchstone I guess for the Wiccan community. I'm forming a coven here myself now which is kind of a big deal because I haven't done that before, but I've decided I want to do that. But you know, I bump into people all the time. It's funny, as a witch I practice solitary for so long, and now that I'm sort of out there talking about it and sharing information about it, I just tend to just bump into people. Rachael Kohn: Yes, I can imagine. Well speaking of The Bodhi Tree, you've had quite an interesting experience with Buddhist meditation. You seem to suggest that Wicca is eclectic. How important is Buddhism, is there an affinity between Wicca and Buddhist meditation? Fiona Horne: Well they're both animist religions in the sense that they're Pagan, that nature is sacred, and in that sense they have a lot in common. But whereas witchcraft has the edict All acts of love and pleasure are sacred to the Goddess, so as far as we're concerned it's Indulge, be sensual, indulge in your sensual self, indulge in the beautiful pleasurable things the world has to offer, eat, drink and be merry. Whereas Buddhism's like Don't do anything, sit in a cave and meditate. I'm exaggerating, but in that sense it kind of, you know I love the fact that witchcraft has that sense of reverence for the natural world but part of that is get out there and live your natural life, be natural, get into everything you want to get into. But my experience of a Buddhist kind of tradition I guess in a sense, though it's not Buddhist, is Vipassana meditation, I did the two-week Vipassana course in the Blue Mountains a few years ago now, and I talk about that in my books as being an amazing way to get in touch with living in the moment and being present in the moment so that you can realise that life can be experienced as an infinite thing, and that's certainly where you go when you work magic, you go between the worlds. Rachael Kohn: But you actually decided after that to put a stainless steel stud under your lip. What was the connection between the Vipassana experience and doing that, which I gather was very painful. Fiona Horne: The whole thing was painful, it's like ten days where you sit for like 14 hours a day and you just focus on - for the first three days you focus on the sensation of air moving over your top lip as you breathe in and out, and then you're given Vipassana which is a kind of, you're talked through a technique of meditation where you sweep your consciousness, you observe your body down and up, down and up over and over and over gain, and you can observe through energy sweeps, blockages and blocked emotions and even illnesses and all sorts of things. It's incredibly painful though. It's painful as you sweep because you're loosening up all this blocked energy, but it's also just really hard to sit on your backside for 14 hours, and not move. And my legs sometimes would be so numb I couldn't, I used to think I'm never going to walk again, I've had no circulation in the bottom half of my body. And then it's just hard anyway, you don't talk to anyone, you don't look at anyone, and yet you're surrounded by people in this environment. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done, yet the most rewarding, without a doubt the most phenomenally rewarding thing I've ever done. And I just felt so transformed after it. But the reason I decided to get the the lip stud piercing, was metal being something considered permanent is like the spirit, it's what Vipassana teaches, the spirit is permanent, flesh is impermanent, and any form of transformation or revelation involves pain, it involves releasing something. So I decided that piercing my lip, being that I didn't speak for 10 days, the permanent metal is really impermanent flesh, summed up those basic issues I guess that Vipashana encourages you to explore. Rachael Kohn: Well there certainly are a lot of tangible symbols and costumes and tattoos that are associated with Wicca. I confess that sometimes I feel there's too much emphasis on the materialistic, on the outward signs. Where is the spirituality in this? I think you were sort of hinting at it, but that was through a Buddhist meditation experience. Fiona Horne: I don't emphasise tattoos or piercings or anything. I think a lot of people who are drawn to witchcraft sometimes will get a tattoo, or mark themselves in some way to denote a rite of passage or an experience. The tattoos I have all relate to specific experiences in my life, and if you look back to tribal cultures, indigenous cultures, it was very common to mark the body physically with a physical sign for a passage or a lesson of the spirit, a rite of passage. You know, just about every witch I know that seriously practices witchcraft, if they choose to be tattooed or mark themselves physically in some way, there's a ritual element involved in that, and a reason as to doing it, it's not a fashion statement at all. People drawn to witchcraft are often inherently very creative and they're tapping in to their creativity and they express that in a visual way and the way they choose to dress or decorate themselves, and I think that's all very positive. And I say this in my books, 'The greatest revelations as far as practising witchcraft, come when you're alone when there's no-one observing you, and you've got nothing to prove to anything or anyone except yourself.' And those moments of introspection, whether you're alone by the ocean looking out at the sun setting, or whether you're sitting under a tree or whether you're just meditating in your room or you're sitting on the toilet thinking about life. I mean it's those moments where you take time out and you observe yourself and go within to places Ly Warren-Clarke calls The Green, the infinite place of fertility that lies within us all. Rachael Kohn: Could Wicca exist without all of the symbols and the costumes and the rituals? Fiona Horne: Goodness, yes. When I say Wicca hasn't a herstory or a history, I don't mean to diminish the fact that there are strains of goddess worship or expressions of spirituality aligned with witchcraft that have gone underground over the years. I guess what I'm trying to say is if you hark back to the burning times where many women, children and men were burnt at the stake, or killed, lynched, whatever, supposedly for practising witchcraft, when in fact they were following the Pagan traditions which were pre-Christian. So a lot of the symbolism, a lot of that sort of physical or visual expression of Paganism had to be hidden, because you'd be thrown into the fire. So certainly the symbols and the physical affectations I guess, the creative expressions of dress or whatever are there to have fun with, but they're not the reason whatsoever, they're just part of it. Rachael Kohn: Well Fiona, you have been well-known for how many years were you in DefFX? Fiona Horne: I was in DefFX for seven years. I'm 36 now, I've been working in the entertainment industry I guess since I was 17 years old, but seriously as a career that sustained me to a degree since DefFX formed which was in 1990, so about 12 years ago. Rachael Kohn: You've been a performer really for years, and of course you're also in a way a performer in the Wiccan tradition. You draw a circle, you step into it, you lead a coven in a ritual. Does the performance element of witchcraft mean a lot to you. Fiona Horne: Yes, I love it. I think when my band broke up and I felt compelled I guess as a cathartic thing to write my first book about witchcraft, it was very autobiographical, I took it out on the road, for the average author I did something quite unusual, which was I went and did shows in nightclubs, and I did rituals in nightclubs and events at bookstores where I was singing and waving my witch's dagger, but that certainly was the performer coming out in me. But any religious ritual involves an element of performance, even the priest down the front of the church. MUSIC/VOICES Rachael Kohn: You really have taken Witchcraft out of the broom closet, as it were, popularising it, writing a lot of books about it, indeed, taking it out on stage. Has that created any flak for you within the Wiccan community, within the Pagan community? Fiona Horne: As far as I know, I've got plenty of support out there. I actually won an award. Pagan Alliance in Australia awarded me with a service to the Pagan community award, I think it was in 2000. It's funny, the only time I think maybe I get negativity directed at me is when people forget that I'm 36 years old, just because I look a bit younger than my age, I didn't just pop out the other day, I've been around working in the entertainment industry for a long time, certainly for a lot longer than I cane out of the broom closet as a witch, and I think sometimes people get confused and think that witchcraft is a gimmick and I'm using it for self-promotion, and they need to be aware that I practiced the craft for 12 years without anyone ever knowing really, except a couple of girlfriends maybe. No-one ever really knew how deeply I was involved in it in my personal life. Really you know, I was very conscious of keeping it quiet, and like I said, I let my song lyrics sort of express my interest a little bit. And on stage I would lose myself in a kind of musical trance I guess. Rachael Kohn: Yes, didn't some people think you were actually putting a spell on the entire audience? I mean weren't there a lot of misconceptions about what you were doing? Fiona Horne: I think that was said in a positive sense that you know, Fiona can put her audience in a trance, but I would just hope that reflected the fact that we were a really good live band. DefFX had a great energy on stage, I mean we might not have captured adequately in our recorded efforts, but some of those shows we did were absolutely incredible, I look back and I think Goodness, as much as time was tough sometimes, gee we had some amazing shows and did some amazing things. The energy that you can build with an audience that's just so - when you look out and everyone is smiling and everyone is lost in the moment, it's just so wonderful. I miss those experiences a lot. Rachael Kohn: Experience is really a central aspect of witchcraft it seems. You just mentioned the trance, and I wonder whether that too is part of the attraction, particularly in a generation that has designer drugs, and indeed in one of your books you talk about drugs as being OK, certain drugs as being OK as part of the Wiccan experience. Fiona Horne: I talk about certain herbs (\"erbs\" did you hear that? I just spoke American! Oh! Sorry!) can have slight narcotic effects, or euphoric effects or whatever, and the legal ones can assist in ritual work. There're certain herbs and things that can assist in inducing a trancelike state. I don't use any of that, I've actually gone really to stop drinking, stop doing everything for quite a while now, and I find that my magical work, my ritual work has just gone through the roof and I've become much more psychic for not having any of those substances. Some people use them as a stepping stone to get to a space where they feel they can experience magic, but I don't try and tell anyone what to do, I just put the information out there and people can make their own decisions. Rachael Kohn: Well that's interesting. You've obviously changed over the years in terms of your practices. Any of your witchy attitudes, have they changed over the years? Fiona Horne: I think so. I think it's necessary. I mean goodness, I'd want to change, I mean if I was fixed in being the same all the time I think anyone would never go anywhere or grow up or anything. I think witchcraft as a religion encourages personal evolution and growth, and it's totally fine to say Well that's how I felt three years ago, I feel differently now. This is what I thought then, this is what I think now. And it's all the necessary part of being a witch, is to be aware of the way you change and the way you evolve, and some things you thought you knew, maybe you didn't know. Things can change and grow and evolve all the time. The way I practice witchcraft has changed a lot, I'm a lot less pedantic now, I'm a lot more intuitive. You know I used to be very pedantic about having to have all the right coloured candles and the right herbs and now I'm much more relaxed and I'm much more prepared to substitute, because I have a far greater overall understanding of how magic works, and a lot of that sort of stuff is just like the props really. The real power comes from within and comes from being aware that everything in the universe has an inherent energy and you can harness that energy. Rachael Kohn: Well Fiona, you're also probably looked upon now as something of an authority, so do you feel more responsible about what you're doing and how you present witchcraft? Fiona Horne: I've always felt responsible. It's funny, I mentioned this briefly in my first book, but I was meditating one night and I had a bit of a revelation, or it was like a voice came to me and said, 'You're gong to have a role to play, a major role to play in changing the way the world perceives Wicca and witchcraft, and you're going to make it possible for people to practice it without being persecuted. It was a really tangible voice, didn't say those words exactly but that was the basic message, in my ear, saying it was going to happen, and I was like, Yes, right, because at the time I was utterly depressed about my band breaking up and just not feeling very strong or assertive or particularly credible about anything at all in life. But I can see that I've done that, especially now living in America, and my book's been published internationally, I've just been translated into German and there's so many other Wiccan authors out there, but I know that especially in Australia, certainly spearheaded the interest there in a big way. And I've been in a position to dispel those negative rumours that witches are satanic, that we're anti-Christian, all that rubbish that doesn't even need to be discussed. So I always felt responsible, but now I guess I feel more comfortable with the responsibility; does that make sense? Rachael Kohn: But you say witchcraft is not anti-Christian, but it certainly has some fairly strong critical attitudes towards what's been called the patriarchal traditions of the Bible. Fiona Horne: Not critical as much as just a natural reaction to something that exists that doesn't speak to us. So we think that the emphasis on oppression and fear and suffering and the dominance of man over woman and man over nature, man the species over nature, all that sort of stuff, doesn't really sit with us, so we just say that. There's plenty of room in the world for everyone's religions. I actually, and I say this in my Teen Witch book, particularly for young people. I got a letter from a teenager who said she goes to a Catholic school and she's forced to do religious education, she doesn't want to because she's a witch. And I said, Well as a witch, it's your job to educate yourself about the other religions so that you can make an educated decision about being a witch. As much as I try not to tell people what to do, I would encourage people to have a respectful attitude to the way the human spirit is expressed in the religious sense around the world. I mean we're all the same species really and we all want to end up in the same place, which is happy. It's just there's various different ways of getting there. Rachael Kohn: The 'live and let live ethic of Wicca, now one of the fastest-growing religions, according to the latest census. Fiona Horne is one of the New Believers, leading the spiritual revolution, here on The Spirit of Things, ABC Radio National. Amongst her books are Magickal Sex, and Life's a Witch - a Handbook for Teen Witches. CHANTING/VOICES Rachael Kohn: Fiona, now that you're in Tinseltown, let's go back to that popular image of the witch in Charmed and Buffy. I guess Hollywood has been responsible to some extent for the images of the witch, and we see that now in popular television programs. Have they given any wrong impressions about witchcraft? I mean Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and Charmed are probably responsible for making it popular, but have they distorted the image in any way? Fiona Horne: Well those shows aren't entirely responsible for making it popular, but they're an expression of its popularity. Sometimes people say to me, Oh are you worried that shows like Charmed or movies like The Craft or Practical Magic are sort of doing witchcraft a disservice? And I sort of say to them Well they're not documentaries on witchcraft, they're TV shows and movies and Harry Potter, you know, it's a book and a movie, they're not documentaries on witchcraft, but there's elements of witchcraft in them. So I think those sort of shows are fun and meant to be creatively inspiring. But as far as promoting real witchcraft, they only potentially put it out there to be discussed and to stimulate an interest, and if you really want to find out about real witchcraft, then you have to do the research and go to the source that talks about real witchcraft and not the Hollywood or entertainment version of it. And I mean obviously the stereotypes like I remember growing up watching The Wizard of Oz with the Wicked Witch of the West and The Good Witch of the North, or East or wherever she was from. You know, there's those stereotypes of the evil old hag and this and that. I think it's very clear now that they are just that stereotype, and real witches could be the person sitting next to you at the bus stop in a suit, you know. It's far more than a Hollywood stunt or a Hollywood special effect, or a visual affectation, it's a way of life. Rachael Kohn: Fiona, some of the witches that you've admired or described in your books strike me to some extent as loners. I know that some witches get married obviously, but it's hard to imagine the sort of typical husband, wife, children scenario. Fiona Horne: I know, I've got to talk the boy that I'm in love with who plays football, into having a hand fasting. I just say, Babe, do you want to jump over the broomstick with me? Because that's how we get married. Jumping over the broomstick's an old Pagan tradition to encourage fertility, make Clint jump over the broomstick. And I want to bring the kids up Pagan. Rachael Kohn: What are your chances of that? Fiona Horne: Oh, I don't know. He'll do what I tell him to do. Oh, I'm only kidding, I'll get into trouble for saying that. No, if we get married we'll probably have a dual ceremony, I'm not too fussed about it, I mean marriage is what it is. I just want to have a celebration with people I love and care about that are going to celebrate the fact that he and I are in love, that's if he asks me to marry him of course, I'm jumping the gun a bit here. But as far as bringing up a family, I would like to bring my children up Pagan of course, but I'm not going to force a religion on them, but I'd like to bring them up with a reverence for nature and a sense that the world is a wonderful, magical place that they can achieve their dreams and have a wonderful life. There are challenges of course, you know, there's crime, there's pollution there's a lot of sadness and a lot of healing to be done, but I want them to feel thrilled and happy that they're alive, and not intimidated by it. Rachael Kohn: Would it be hard to bring up kids Pagan in mainstream society do you think? Fiona Horne: Not really, I don't think so. No. Rachael Kohn: Do you think witchcraft is ever going to have the kind of status that other religions have as part of the mainstream, yes? Fiona Horne: Absolutely. I think that one of our strengths in a sense is that we are so, how would I say this, I was going to say unquantifiable, but I just mean like in the sense of there's no one body that governs us, or organises us. We are all individuals, but we have enough in common to unite us, and I think the key to witchcraft and Wicca's survival as a religion is that flexibility, is that respect for the individual's way of doing things. But we do have enough in common, as I said, to sort of unite us, but as soon as we become fixed and bogged down in one way of doing things, I think that would spell the death knell for us. But I feel very confident and positive that witchcraft is a vital expression of human spirituality and a necessary expression of where we're evolving. Humans we know, we have to start becoming more environmentally aware and responsible, we have to start encouraging tolerance and acceptance, and revering life and the ability to create and give life, rather than destroy it. Or we're not going to survive as a species. Rachael Kohn: Yes, I agree with you. Fiona Horne: That's just plain fact, you know, simple as that. Rachael Kohn: Fiona, it's been great talking to you, thank you so much. Fiona Horne: Thanks, Rachael, I've enjoyed talking to you, too. Do you think Clint's going to ask me to marry him now? Now I've said it on radio? Rachael Kohn: I think so. I hope so. For your sake. Fiona Horne: I've got to move back to Australia first. There's only so much magic I can do, I really can't split myself down the middle and be in two countries at once. I'm still working on that one. Rachael Kohn: Well you'll need your broom. Fiona Horne: Oh goodness yes, my broom, much faster than Qantas. Rachael Kohn: Thanks so much, you. MUSIC Rachael Kohn: Fiona Horne might be jumping over the broomstick in married bliss. She was speaking to me from Los Angeles. This program was produced by me and Geoff Wood, with technical production by Angus Kingston. Most of the music you heard was from the CD 'Magic' by Fiona's former band, DefFX. Next week, join me for a look at Islam, post-September 11 when we hear from three prominent commentators, Tariq Ali, Stanley Fish, and from India, M.J. Akbar, who has just written a book on Jihad. Till then, so long from me, Rachael Kohn. MUSIC Former rock-star turned witch, Fiona Horne began her personal search for spiritual fulfilment during her Catholic school days. But life on the road with rock band Def FX, would change her course. Now she finds comfort and strength in a religion that is Goddess-centred and gives her freedom to perform creatively in its rituals. With her book, Life's a Witch: a Handbook for Teen Witches, Fiona has become a mentor to young women who are \"charmed\" by the popular images of witches on TV. "}
