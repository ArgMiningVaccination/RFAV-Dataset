How to Encourage Pretend Play As a new mom, I had one question when it came to choosing toys for my children: Why do all the best toys have to be so messy? - Legos - Blocks - Play-doh - Craft Supplies The same toys that allow children to develop important skills often have tons of pieces that are: - Messy - Easy to lose - Difficult to keep neat and tidy When our family started exploring minimalism, I decided to search for gender-neutral toys that came with their own storage solution. This has allowed me to perpetuate my love of all things organized while the children are still allowed to play, build and explore. We have found that when the toy comes with it's own storage container, the kids naturally put everything away when they are done playing. It keeps our home neat and tidy and keeps me from going all \"Mommy Dearest\" about Lego pieces being everywhere If you love to keep an organized home - [or would like to start being clutter-free with kids](https://simply-well-balanced.com/clutter-free-home/) you are going to love these clutter-free toys.
