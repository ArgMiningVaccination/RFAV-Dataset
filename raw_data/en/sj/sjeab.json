In vitro studies using mammalian cell cultures reveal an increase in vitamin D receptor content after exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3. To test the hypothesis that 1,25(OH)2D3 increases enterocyte vitamin D receptor content in vivo, male rats were fed either a normal calcium diet (NCD, 1.2% Ca) or low calcium diet (LCD, 0.002% Ca). After 21 d LCD increased serum 1,25(OH)2D3 levels (27 +/- 3 vs. 181 +/- 17 pg/ml, P less than and calcium vs. 204 +/- 47 nmol/cm2.h, NCD vs. LCD, P less than 0.01) and jejunum (23 +/- 3 vs. 46 +/- 4, P less than 0.007). No change in serosal to mucosal calcium fluxes (Jsm) were observed. (34.1 +/- 9.5 vs. 84.9 +/- 7.7) without a change in the receptor affinity for 1,25(OH)2D3 (Kd is 0.17 +/- 0.06 NCD duodenum, respectively). Duodenal polyadenylated vitamin D receptor mRNA determined by Northern blot analysis did not increase appreciably during LCD, suggesting that upregulation in vivo may not be due primarily to increased receptor synthesis. The results of this study indicate that under physiologic conditions as during chronic dietary calcium restriction, increased intestinal vitamin D receptor content accompanies increased calcium active transport. Upregulation of the vitamin D receptor by 1,25(OH)2D3 may result primarily from posttranslational processes that decrease degradation of the receptor with increased receptor synthesis responsible for a negligible portion of the accumulation.
