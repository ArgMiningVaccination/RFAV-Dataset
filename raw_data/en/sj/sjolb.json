His work revolutionized modern understanding of disease biology. Next year he will be inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame, joining five others. With them, he is recognized by the Canadian Medical Association for his outstanding leadership and contributions to medicine and health science. His work in cancer genomics has led to extraordinary improvements in cancer outcomes in British Columbia and beyond. \"This year's honourees have made tremendous contributions to the advancement and improvements of medicine and health sciences and we are thrilled to see them recognized today\", says Dr. Sandy Buchman, President of the Canadian Medical Association. Dr. Marra's work in the BC Cancer POG program takes information derived from thousands of individual cancer genomes and transcriptomes to develop a new generation of predictive treatment strategies for cancer patients. His current research activities revolve around the development and application of methods and technologies to characterize cancer genomes and to identify genetic and epigenetic changes that drive cancer progression. His other honourable recognitions include the Ron Dix Award for Lifetime Achievement which he received earlier this year. He is also the Canada Research Chair in Genome Sciences, a member of the Order of British Columbia, a 2017 Canadian Cancer Research Alliance Outstanding Achievement in Cancer Research Award, a 2015 Dr. Chew Wei Memorial Prize in Cancer Research, Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, a Terry Fox Medal, Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences, and more. He and his fellow honourees will be formally welcomed into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame at an induction ceremony in Vancouver on April 17. The Canadian Medical Hall of Fame (CMHF) celebrates Canadian heroes whose work advances health in Canada and the world and fosters future generations of health professionals through the delivery of local and national youth education programs, scholarships and awards.
