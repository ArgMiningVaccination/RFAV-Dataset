Fortunately, a growing number of clinicians are practicing functional medicine (FM): an evidence-based clinical approach that addresses the environmental influences and imbalances that underlie disease\u2014with the idea that when these are addressed, the body can return to its natural state of health and balance for long-term health. The following content delves into FM's guiding principles and general approach, to help you determine whether partnering with a conventional medicine doctor or a FM practitioner is what you need on your journey toward healing and maintaining health. [The Textbook of Functional Medicine](https://www.functionalmedicine.org/listing_detail.aspx?id=2415&cid=0) defines FM as the \"prevention, early assessment, and improved management of complex, chronic disease by intervening at multiple levels to correct core clinical imbalances and thereby restore each patient's functionality and health to the greatest extent possible.\" FM [is based on](https://www.functionalmedicine.org/files/library/six-core-principles.pdf) six core principles: A FM practitioner acts like a detective, exploring the clinical imbalances that give rise to your symptoms, then delving into the root causes\u2014environmental factors and genetic tendencies that influence your health. This clinical model can be compared to a tree, where the leaves represent the symptoms, the trunk represents imbalances, and the roots are the environmental and genetic dispositions. Your symptoms are equivalent to the leaves of a tree: highly visible and an important indication of your underlying health. FM practitioners use symptoms as guides to better understand the underlying imbalances, rather than focusing on treating symptoms directly (which is important, but not the ultimate goal). Like a tree trunk branching into leaves, systemic imbalances develop into symptoms. FM practitioners thoroughly explore possible imbalances to gain a holistic view on where symptoms are coming from. In FM, imbalances are categorized within the following systems and processes: A condition as simple as chronic headaches could point to an imbalance in one or many of these categories, and it is the responsibility of an FM practitioner to determine what system or process is not optimally functioning. Environmental inputs and your genetic disposition are similar to the roots of a tree: they give rise to clinical imbalances, which then turn into symptoms. Environment. Harmful lifestyle choices and toxic exposures can strongly influence your health. The negative effects may not appear right away, because your body is resilient, but can accumulate with time and eventually cause a chronic condition. To determine the root of clinical imbalances, an FM practitioner may ask questions such as: Genetic Disposition. Environmental factors are filtered through your genetic (physical, mental, and emotional) tendencies. Your attitudes, beliefs, and the unique way your body and mind process environmental inputs can influence your susceptibility to developing certain conditions. Often, altering your perception of a situation, processing a traumatic memory, or learning how to better manage stress can go a long way in your healing. The functional medicine approach is a bit different than the conventional medicine approach because it involves exploring every aspect that could be influencing your health problems and empowering you to take an active role in your healing. Rather than giving you medications to mask your symptoms, the goal is to dig to the root of the issue so that you can fully heal from the bottom up for your long-term health.
