Keep reading to discover 3 medical conditions you can treat with IV hydration therapy. Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder that causes musculoskeletal pain throughout the body. A glitch in the way the brain and spinal cord interprets pain signals means [fibromyalgia sufferers may feel increased levels of pain](https://www.webmd.com/fibromyalgia/guide/fibromyalgia-causes) from minor bumps and bruises. They also tend to experience consistent pain on a regular basis\u2014even when they're not sick or injured. Individuals suffering from this frustrating and painful condition may also experience symptoms such as: While doctors don't yet understand [what causes fibromyalgia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibromyalgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354780), they do know that its symptoms can be triggered by psychological stress or physical trauma such as surgery or infection. Unfortunately, these symptoms can also worsen slowly over time, with no one single stressor. We have yet to discover a cure for fibromyalgia, but there are currently several viable treatment options. Some medications have been proven effective for managing symptoms, while exercise and relaxation techniques can also help alleviate pain. Another promising treatment option is IV hydration therapy. Treating Fibromyalgia with IV Hydration Therapy Researchers at the Alexian Brothers Hospital Network in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, performed a clinical trial to determine the [efficacy of IV hydration therapy in treating symptoms of fibromyalgia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17515022). Seven therapy-resistant fibromyalgia sufferers were given a modified version of the Myers' cocktail of intravenous nutrient therapy once a week for 8 weeks. The results? While no participants reported complete resolution of pain and fatigue, all participants reported the following: Overall, participants experienced a 60% reduction in pain and an 80% reduction in fatigue.

Depression is more than sporadic sadness and is different from grief. According to the American Psychiatric Association, depression is a serious medical illness that can greatly impair your ability to function on a daily basis. Some [common symptoms of depression](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/depression/what-is-depression) include: These symptoms must be pervasive for at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression. The American Psychiatric Association [recommends receiving a thorough diagnostic assessment ](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/depression/what-is-depression)from a verified health professional in order to receive a valid diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. The most common treatments for depression include medication (antidepressants) and psychotherapy (\"talk therapy\"). However, many individuals have found additional relief from depressive symptoms in the form of intravenous fluids and hydration. But First\u2014The Connection Between Dehydration and Depression Just as your organs need proper hydration for proper function, so does the rest of your body and mind. [\"Our brains depend on proper hydration to function optimally,\" ](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/you-illuminated/201010/why-your-brain-needs-water)writes Joshua Gowan, Ph.D., in an article for PsychologyToday.com. \"Brain cells require a delicate balance between water and various elements to operate, and when you lose too much water, that balance is disrupted. Your brain cells lose efficiency.\" In fact, a study of 25 healthy young women by the Human Performance Laboratory at the University of Connecticut found that even [mild levels of dehydration (1.36%) lead to bodily disturbances](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22190027) such as: Dehydration Is Linked to Insufficient Serotonin Levels Science has proven that dehydration can decrease the production of serotonin in your brain. Sometimes referred to as \"the happy chemical,\" serotonin is the neurotransmitter that contributes to feelings of happiness and wellbeing. If your brain doesn't produce normal levels of serotonin, you may be at risk of experiencing mood disturbances and even depression. According to TheBestBrainPossible.com, \"The amino acid tryptophan is converted to serotonin in your brain. An adequate amount of water is needed for tryptophan to be transported across the blood-brain barrier. Hence, [dehydration limits the amount of tryptophan available to the brain](https://thebestbrainpossible.com/how-dehydration-contributes-to-depression/) and consequently [decreases] serotonin levels.\" Dehydration Is Linked to Increased Stress Levels Studies have shown that [dehydration can increase the stress hormone known as cortisol](https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/water-stress-reduction#1). Depriving vital organs of the fluids and hydration they require in order to function properly puts stress on the body. And unfortunately, a body under stress becomes even more dehydrated due to the loss of fluid that results from rapid breathing and an increased heart rate. Everybody experiences stress from time to time, but [chronic stress can increase your risk of developing depression](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/expert-answers/stress/faq-20058233). Treating Depression with IV Hydration Therapy If your depression is caused or exacerbated by dehydration or nutritional deficiencies, then IV hydration therapy may be a suitable option to supply your body with the essential vitamins, minerals, fluids, and hydration it needs to help treat your depressive symptoms, boost your energy, and enhance your mood. Mobile IV Therapy Via Oasis Hydration Our Revive & Energize treatment\u2014 [an improved version of the popular Myers' Cocktail](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments)\u2014contains the nourishing hydration and healing ingredients you need to start feeling your very best.

Allergies are your immune system's abnormal reaction to a foreign substance such as pollen, pet dander, or even certain foods. According to the Mayo Clinic, \"your immune system produces substances known as antibodies. When you have allergies, your immune system makes [antibodies that identify a particular allergen as harmful](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351497), even though it isn't.\" Your immune system may react to your body coming into contact with an allergen by causing inflammation within your skin, sinuses, airways, or digestive system. The severity of [allergy symptoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/allergies/symptoms/) can range from minor annoyances to full-blown, life-threatening emergencies. Common symptoms include: Most allergies can't be cured, but there are various treatments you can try to help relieve your allergy symptoms. Avoiding exposure to allergens is always a good idea (but unfortunately not always possible). Allergy medications such as decongestants and antihistamines are viable short-term treatments, and steroids can help reduce inflammation. Another option you may not have previously considered is IV hydration therapy. IV hydration treatments combine hydrating fluids with nourishing vitamins and powerful antioxidants to flush allergens out of your system and boost your overall health and wellness. Treating Allergies with IV Hydration Therapy In 2018, researchers from a number of different universities in Germany performed a clinical trial to determine the [effectiveness of intravenous vitamin C in treating allergies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29950123). 71 participants with allergy-related respiratory issues took part in the study, which concluded that \"treatment with intravenous high-dose vitamin C reduces allergy-related symptoms.\" Additionally, Dr. Alan Gaby's article for the [Alternative Medicine Review](http://www.altmedrev.com/archive/publications/7/5/389.pdf) includes a case study about a 38-year-old man with a long history of experiencing seasonal allergic rhinitis, a response to allergens that results in a number of unpleasant symptoms. This man, in particular, experienced itchy eyes, nasal congestion, and fatigue for about a month each spring. During a symptomatic period, he received an IV infusion which included 12 ml of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) as well as B complex and other B vitamins. Not only did this vitamin-and-fluid combination provide instant relief, but it also kept his symptoms under control when he repeated the treatments as needed during hay fever season.
