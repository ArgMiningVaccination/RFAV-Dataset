All Natural Medicine Clinic is located next to Randolph Medical Center. In front of the medical office (house), there are about 6-7 parking spaces. If all of the spaces are taken, then parking overflows to the Randolph Medical Center. I'll admit that the medical office was hard to find on the first visit but after knowing where it was located, I had no trouble finding it. It's driveway has a white mailbox with the word \"Acupuncture\" in a bright blue. This clinic offers acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, and other natural solutions. Dr. Hou has over 40 years of experience in both western and Chinese medicine - treating and curing patients with cancer, autoimmune diseases, lupus, alzheimer's disease, asthma, allergies, injuries, among other things. I have many issues including anxiety, migraine headaches, insomnia, stress, stomach pain, acid reflux with back pain, and nerve issues. For the past two months, I have been getting treatment here and it seems to be doing my body wonders thus far. I HIGHLY recommend getting treated at All Natural Medicine :) - 1/24/2023 Great! Always perfect service and treatment. Started going here years ago and I highly recommend. - 9/1/2021 I have travelled far and wide in search of a Holistic Doctor to remedy the ailments of a sensitive body. I came to Dr. Hou with an unconventional pain which had lasted me everyday for 3 consecutive weeks. In this time frame I saw another acupuncturist who was trained in India---yet to no avail, my vertigo, fatigue, nausea, and labored breathing continued. I saw Dr. Hou Friday August 27, 2021 and we began the healing. After 2 visits, I WAS HEALED. Do not look further my friends. As a teacher who believes strongly in integrity and oriental medicine--this woman is a Pioneer in her field. I am now healed and will continue to see Dr. Hou so as long as I reside in DC. Much thanks and appreciation for the gift this woman has. - 8/28/2021 I have been seeing TCM all my life and have been fortunate to consult with excellent doctors that have succeeded in treating my 'heatiness'. However, I felt Dr Hou gave an incorrect diagnosis and was not able to make my 'dampness' any better. I stopped after 2 visits. - 4/3/2021 Highly recommend Dr. Hou and this clinic. After a year of dealing with very painful de quervain's tendonitis in my wrist -- i'd tried resting it, Advil, two cortisone shots, wearing a brace, and specialist said next step was surgery -- I remembered to try acupuncture and herbs. Now, after 2 months of visits with Dr. Hou, and herbal pills, my wrist is close to fully healed and I know a full recovery is around the corner. I just wish I'd started sooner instead of letting the problem become so entrenched! Dr. Hou and the support staff are awesome, and the clinic has felt completely safe during covid. Dr. Hou is generous with explanations about the healing process, so this has been a learning experience as well as a healing one. - 9/26/2020 Dr. Hou helped me to rebuild my immune system and get back to normal activities that I might not have the chance to do. I was diagnosis with a several liver disease and doctors informed me that I will need a liver transplant. Upon release from the hospital (while waiting on an available liver), I spent months recovering from home. The recovery process was slow and not making any progress. It was during this time that my I came across the All Natural Medicine Clinic. With ongoing treatment, I am seeing significant improvements. I am grateful for the care she has provided me. Highly recommended!!! - 9/19/2019 Dr. Hou is the best. I was having some stomach issues and I kept throwing up every morning it was difficult to keep food or water down. I went to the hospital and waited for 8 hours to be seen and given a prescription with HORRIBLE side effects. The doctor at the hospital said \" you have a bug or something\" REALLY? I started to look for a natural medicine clinic and found Dr. Hou's office that was 5 minutes away from my house and they were able to see me immediately. In about 45 minutes I left with a diagnosis and two Chinese herbal teas. She said to drink them for a week and on the second day of drinking my teas my appetite was coming back and I was eating after about 7 days of not being able to hold down anything. Thank you, Dr. Hou! - 8/17/2018 I am thankful that I found Dr Hou. This is a decent Accupuncture clinic, and Dr Hou is super knowledgeable about Chinese medicine and its connection to western medicine. She listens and cares about her patients. I have observed significant improvements under her care. Highly recommended! - 4/9/2018 Family member has serious health issue. Dr. Hou used her accupuncture and herbal remedies to nurse him with incredible improvement. She is very compassionate and very serious about helping him get better. Great listener and with her many years of experience I feel comfortable in recommending other family members to see her. - 3/30/2011 Difficult to find! I drove around in the rain looking for this place forever. It was so hard to actually reach the driveway, especially since the driveway and walkway look the same and are tucked in between some other house-like office dwellings, hidden behind trees. I could \"sorta\" see the driveway but kept slightly passing it. And since it's located on a major road you cannot just back up. It's a u-turn hell! So I finally make it to the driveway and the parking spaces are all taken. There is nowhere else to park. I have an appointment so I decide to go in and let them know that my car is blocking all of the other cars. They don't have a solution, so I decide to leave. No loss really, since I can barely take the smell of the place. It smells like a smoker's break room. Also, have fun getting out of the driveway as you back out into major oncoming traffic. Note: this review is not for the acupunture itself since I did not receive the treatment due to the parking situation. "}
