FARGO \u2014 Daniel Pozarnsky's bout with COVID-19 landed him in Sanford Health's downtown Fargo COVID-19 unit. His experience has prompted him to backpedal on some recent claims that were critical of the vaccines. \"It seems like the lungs and brain are the big thing,\" Pozarnsky said, adding he still feels like he was hit by a truck. \"It feels like a TBI, traumatic brain injury or concussion.\" The longtime chiropractor from West Fargo is recovering from a COVID-19 diagnosis in late July and is still suffering from the after-effects. \"That is what is so frustrating,\" Pozarnsky said. \"Things you could do before but now you can't.\" His struggle with the coronavirus started with a sinus infection. Soon after, he developed a fever, and then he went to Sanford Health where he was later the COVID-19 unit. ADVERTISEMENT \"I asked the nurse, 'Am I going to be OK?' And the nurse said, 'We aren't supposed to tell you,'\" Pozarnsky said. While hospitalized, he sent out social media messages asking people to pray for him. \"I felt like I was dying, and I have never felt that before,\" he said. One of his posts sparked a lot of reaction from people. \"Karma's a b----,\" he wrote. \"I should have gotten the vaccine.\" Pozarnsky previously made other posts critical of vaccinations. \"I am not saying vaccines are bad, there just isn't enough data yet,\" he said. Pozarnsky was hospitalized for seven days. Even though he has now been home for weeks, he is too worn out to work or take care of daily chores. He also lost 25 pounds. ADVERTISEMENT The experience is something he doesn't want to repeat. \"I can't go through that again; I feel like I would die,\" he said. Since his chiropractic business is not open, friends have started a [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/helping-hand-for-drdan) to help him get back on his feet. He hopes to reopen his business in a few weeks. ADVERTISEMENT "}
