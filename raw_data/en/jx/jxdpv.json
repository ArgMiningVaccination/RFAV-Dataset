Children aged 5 to 11 can now get vaccinated against Covid-19. Children aged 5 to 11 can receive a free Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. This is around one third of the dose given to people aged 12 years and older. Children aged 12 years and over can already receive the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Why should I get my child vaccinated? By vaccinating your children, you can help to: Reduce the spread of COVID-19 Protect them from getting sick from COVID-19 Keep schools open, so children can have more face-to-face learning and playtime with their friends. Although many children only get mild COVID symptoms, children can spread COVID-19 very easily. It is important to vaccinate children to protect you and your family from getting COVID-19. How many doses does my child need? Children should get two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, spaced 8 weeks (2 months) apart. A shorter gap between doses may be used in special circumstances, please speak to your GP. Is it safe to vaccinate children? Vaccines have been given to children for a long time to protect them from a range of diseases. The Pfzier COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective to use for children between the ages of 5 and 11. It has been approved by Australian Government Health Authorities. All vaccines have side effects, like any other medicine, but serious side effects are very rare. Children can experience side effects after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines such as: a sore arm, headache, fever and fatigue. These are common and expected side effects which can almost always be managed at home with paracetamol. You should talk to your doctor if you have more questions about getting your child vaccinated. Where can I get my child vaccinated? Bookings at GPs and pharmacies are now available. Many pharmacies will also have walk-in appointments so you can get your child vaccinated in your local area. You can also get your child vaccinated at a state vaccination centres. For NSW Use the Clinic Finder Federal Government tool, this also allows you to choose a language from the drop-down tool.

If your child is afraid of needles it's important to prepare for your appointment. Explain to them what is going to happen at the appointment, and the needle will feel like a small prick and their arm might be a little bit sore afterwards. It can help to get your child vaccinated in a place they know like a local pharmacy or doctor. You can bring along your child's favourite toys or books to help make the experience more positive or distract them. Tell your provider that your child is afraid of needles before your appointment so they can make sure there is plenty of time during your appointment. https://covid-vaccine.healthdirect.gov.au/booking/ Or call to book on 1800 57 11 55 / Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS): 131 450 Contains tracks Amharic - Vaccinations for 5 - 11 Year Olds (NSW) by NSW Multilingual News Service - NEMBC Media published on 2022-01-21T01:04:31Z Arabic - Vaccinations for 5 - 11 Year Olds (NSW) by NSW Multilingual News Service - NEMBC Media published on 2022-01-27T06:37:25Z Assyrian - Vaccinations for 5 - 11 Year Olds (NSW) by NSW Multilingual News Service - NEMBC Media published on 2022-02-14T00:15:47Z Bosnian - Vaccinations for 5 - 11 Year Olds (NSW) by NSW Multilingual News Service - NEMBC Media published on 2022-01-31T00:30:58Z Cantonese - Vaccinations for 5 - 11 Year Olds (NSW) by NSW Multilingual News Service "}
