Albrecht Medical Center to highlight the health needs and well -being of residents in Livingston Count y. Through this needs assessment, collaborative community partners have identified numerous health issues impacting individuals and families in the Livingston County region. Several themes are prevalent in this health -needs assessment - the demographic co mposition of the Livingston County region, the predictors for and prevalence of diseases, leading causes of mortality, accessibility to health services and healthy behaviors. Results from this study can be used for strategic decision- making purposes as they directly relate to the health needs of the community. The study was designed to assess issues and trends impacting the communities served by the collaborative, as well as perceptions of targeted stakeholder groups. This study includes a detailed anal ysis of secondary data to assess information regarding the health status of the community. In order to perform these analyses, information was collected from numerous secondary sources, including publicly available sources as well as private sources of data . Additionally, primary data were collected for the general population and the at- risk or economically disadvantaged population. Areas of investigation included perceptions of the community health issues, unhealthy behaviors, issues with quality of life, healthy behaviors and access to medical care, dental care, prescription medication and mental -health counseling. Additionally, demographic characteristics of respondents were utilized to provide insights into why certain segments of the population respond ed differently. CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 4 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Ultimately, the identification and prioritization of the most important health -related issues in the Livingston County region were identified. The collaborative team considered health needs based on: (1) magnitude of the issue (i.e., what p ercentage of the population was impacted by the issue); (2) severity of the issue in terms of its relationship with morbidities and mortalities; (3) potential impact through collaboration. Using a modified version of the Hanlon Method, two significant health needs were identified and determined to have equal priority: Healthy Behaviors - defined as active living and healthy eating, and their impact on obesity Health y Aging CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 5 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 I. INTRODUCTION Background The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), enacted March 23, 2010, added new requirements for tax -exempt charitable hospital organizations to conduct community health needs assessments and to adopt implementation strategies to meet the community health needs identified through the assessments. This community health needs assessment (CHNA) takes into account input from specific individuals who represent the broad interests of the community served by OSF Saint James - John W. Albrecht Medical Center including those with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. For this study, a community health -needs assessment is defined as a systematic process involving the community, to identify and analyze community health needs and assets in order to prioritize these needs, create a plan, and act upon unmet community health needs. Results from this assessment will be made widely available to the public. This CHNA Report was approved by the OSF HealthCare System's Board of Directors o n July 2 5, 2022. The structure of the CHNA is based on standards used by the Internal Revenue Service to develop Form 990, Schedule H -Hospitals, designated solely for tax -exempt charitable hospital organizations. The fundamental areas of the community heal th needs assessment are illustrated in Figure 1 . Figure 1 Collaborative Team and Community Engagement In order to engage the entire community in the CHNA process, a collaborative team of health -professional experts and key community advocates was created. Members of the collaborative team were carefully selected to ensure representation of the broad interests of the community. Specifically, team members included representatives from OSF Saint James - John W. Albrecht Medical Center , members of the Livingston County Health Department, and administrators from key community partner organizations. Engagement o ccurred throughout the entire process, resulting in shared ownership of the assessment. CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 6 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 The entire collaborative team met in the first and second quarter of 2022. Additionally, numerous meetings were held between the facilitators and specific individuals during the process. Specifically, members of the Collaborative Team consisted of individuals with special knowledge of and expertise in the healthcare of the community. Note that the collaborative team provided input for all sections of the CHNA. Individu als, affiliations, titles and expertise can be found in APPENDIX 1 : MEMBERS OF COLLABORATIVE TEAM . Definition of the Community In order to determine the geographic boundaries for OSF Saint James - John W. Albrecht Medical Center , analyses were completed to identify what percentage of inpatient and outpatient activity was represented by Livingston Count y. Data show that Livingston Coun ty represent 76% of all patients for the hospital . In addition to defining the community by geographic boundaries, this study targets the at- risk population as an area of potential opportunity to improve the health of the community. Note that the at- risk population was defined as those individuals who were eligible to receive Medicaid based on the S tate of Illinois guidelines using household size and income level. Purpose of the Community Health- Needs Assessment In the initial meeting, the collaborative committee identified the purpose of this study. Specifically , this study has been designed to provide necessary information to health -care organizations, including hospitals, clinics and health departments, in order to create strategic plans in program design, access and delivery . Results of this study will act as a platform that allows health -care organizations to orchestrate limited resources to improve management of high -priority challenges. By working together, hospitals, clinics, agencies and health departments will use this CHNA to improve the quality of healthcare in Livingston County. When feasible, data are assessed longitudinally to identify trends and patterns by comparing with results from the 201 9 CHNA and benchmarked with State of Illinois averages. Community Feedba ck from Previous Assessments The 2019 CHNA and implementation plan were made widely available to the community to allow for feedback. Specifically, the hospital posted both a full version and a summary version of the 2019 CHNA on its website. In order to encourage written feedback, the hospital specifically included a section labeled Share Your Feedback and provided instructions regarding how individuals from the community could provide comments to the CHNA. While no written feedback was received by individ uals from the community via the available mechanism for the CHNA or implementation plan, verbal feedback was provided by key stakeholders from community -service organizations and incorporated as part of the collaborative process. 2019 CHNA Health Needs and Implementation Plans The 2019 CHNA for Livingston County identified two significant health needs. These included: h ealthy behaviors, defined as healthy eating and active living, and their impact on obesity; behavioral h ealth, CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 7 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 including mental health ; and substance abuse, with specific focus not included in behavioral health . Specific actions were taken to address these needs. Detailed discussions of goals and strategies to improve these health needs can be seen in APPENDIX 2: ACT IVITIES RELATED TO 2019 CHNA PRIORITIZED NEEDS . Note that numerous challenges associated with the COVID -19 pandemic had significant impact on the activities discussed in appendix 2. Social Determinants of Health This CHNA incorporates important factors associated with Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). SDOH are important environmental factors, such as where people are born, live, work and play, that affect people's well- being, physical and mental health, and quality of life. According to research conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy People 2030 has identified five SDOH that should be included in assessing community health (Figure 2 ). Figure 2 Healthy People 2030, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Retriev ed January Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Assessment of SDOH is included in th e CHNA, as social determinants help contribute to health inequities and disparities. Simply creating interventions without incorporating SDOH will have limited impact on improving community health for people living in underserved or at- risk areas. II. METHODS To complete the comprehensive community health -needs assessment, multiple sources were examined. Secondary statistical data were used to assess the community profile, morbidity rates and causes of mortality. Additionally, a study was completed to ex amine perceptions of the community health -related issues, healthy behaviors, behavioral health, food security, social determinants of health and access to healthcare. Secondary Data Collection Existing secondary statistical data were first used to develop an overall assessment of health -related issues in the community. Within each section of the report, there are definitions, importance of categories, data and interpretations. At the end of each chapter, there is a section on key takeaways. Based on several retreats, a separate OSF Collaborative Team used COMPdata Informatics (affiliated with Illinois Health and Hospital Association (IHA) ) to identify six primary categories of diseases, including: age related, cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, diabetes and infections. In order to define each disease category, modified definitions developed by Sg2 were used. Sg2 specializes in consulting for health -care organizations. Their team of experts includes MDs, PhDs, RNs and health -care leaders with extensive strategic, operational, clinical, academic, technological and financial experience. Primary Data Collection In addition to existing secondary data sources, primary survey data were also collected. This section describes the research methods used to collect, code, verify and analyze primary survey data. Specifically, the research design used for this study: survey design, data collection and data integrity. Survey Instrument Design Initially, all publicly available health -needs assessments in the U.S. were as sessed to identify common themes and approaches to collecting community health -needs data. By leveraging best practices from these surveys, a new survey in 2021 was designed for use with both the general population and the at- risk community. To ensure that all critical areas were being addressed, the entire collaborative team was involved in survey design/approval through several fact- finding sessions. Additionally, several focus groups were used to collect the qualitative information necessary to design survey items. Specifically, for the community health -needs assessment, eight specific sets of items were included: Ratings of health issues in the community - to assess the importance of various community health concerns. Survey items included assessments of topics such as cancer, diabetes and obesity. CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 9 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Ratings of unhealthy behaviors in the community - to assess the importance of various unhealthy behaviors. Survey items included assessments of topics such as violence, drug abuse and smoking. Ratings of issues concerning well -being - to assess the importance of various issues relating to well -being in the community. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to healthcare, safer neighborhoods and effective public transportation. Accessibility to healthcare - to assess the degree to which residents could access healthcare when needed. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to medical, dental and mental -healthcare, as well as access to prescription medication. Healthy behaviors - to assess the degree to which residents exhibited healthy behaviors. The survey items included assessments of topics such as exercise, healthy eating habits and cancer screenings. Behavioral health - to assess community issues related to areas such as anxiety and depression. Food security - to assess access to healthy food alternatives. Social determinants of health - to assess the impact that social determinants may have on the above -mentioned areas. Finally, demographic information was collected to assess background information necessary to segment markets in terms of the eight categories discussed above. A copy of the final survey is included in APPENDIX 3 : SURVEY . Sample Size In order to identify our potential population, we first identified the percentage of the Livingston County population that was living in poverty. Specifically, we multiplied the population of the county by its respective poverty rate to identify the minimum sample size to study the at- risk population. The poverty rate for Livingston County is 13.0 per cent. The population used for the calculation was 35,582 yielding a total of 4,626 residents living in poverty in the Livingston County area. A normal approximation to the hypergeometric distribution was assumed given the targeted sample size. n = (Nz2pq) /(E2 (N -1) + z2 pq) where: n = the required sample size N = the population size z = the value that specified the confidence interval (use 95% CI) pq = population proportions (set at .05) E =desired accuracy of sample proportions (set at +/ - .05) CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 10 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 For p rovi de a representative profile when assessing the aggregated population for the Livingston County region, the general population was combined with a portion of the at- risk population. To represent the at-risk population as a percentage of the aggregate population, a random -number generator was used to select at- risk cases to include in the general sample. Additionally, efforts were made to ensure that the demography of the sample was aligned with population demographics according to U.S. Census data. This provided a total usable sample of 534 respondents for analyzing the aggregate population. Sample characteristics can be seen in APPENDIX 4 : CHARACTERISTICS OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS . Data Collection Survey data were collected in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2021. To collect data in this study, two techniques were used. First, an online version of the survey was created. Second, a paper version of the survey was distributed. I n order to be sensitive to the needs of respondents, surveys stressed assurance of complete anonymity. Note that versions of both the online survey and paper survey were translated into Spanish. To specifically target the at- risk population, surveys were d istributed at homeless shelters, food pantries and soup kitchens. Since the at- risk population was specifically targeted as part of the data collection effort, this became a stratified sample, as other groups were not specifically targeted based on their socio- economic status. Note that use of electronic surveys to collect community -level data may create a potential for bias from convenience sampling error. To recognize for potential bias in the community sample, a second control sample of data was colle cted. Specifically, the control sample consisted of random patients surveyed at the hospital, assuming that patients receiving care represent an unbiased representation of the community. All questions on the patient version of the survey pertaining to access to healthcare were removed, as these questions were not relevant to current patients. Data from the community sample and the control sample were compared using t- tests and tetrachoric correlations when appropriate. Results show that the community sample did not exhibit any significance patterns of bias. If specific relationships exhibited a potential for bias between the community sample and the control sample, they are identified in the social -determinants sections of the analyses within each chapter. Data Integrity Comprehensive analyses were performed to verify the integrity of the data for this research. Without proper validation of the raw data, any interpretation of results could be inaccurate and misleading if used for decision -making. Therefore, several tests were performed to ensure that the data were valid. These tests were performed before any analyses were undertaken. Data were checked for coding accuracy, using descriptive frequency statistics to verify that all data items were correct. T his was followed by analyses of means and standard deviations and comparison of primary data statistics to existing secondary data. Analytic Techniques To ensure statistical validity, several different analytic techniques were used. Specifically, frequencies and descriptive statistics were used for identifying patterns in residents' ratings of various health CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 11 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 concerns. Additionally, appropriate statistical techniques were used for identification of existing relationships between perceptions, behaviors and demographic data. Specifically, Pearson correlations, X2 tests and tetrachoric correlations were used when appropriate, given characteristics of the specific data being analyzed.

Population data provide an overview of population growth trends and build a foundation for additional analysis of data. Population Growth Data from the last census indicate the population of Livingston County decreased 1 % between 201 6 and 202 0 (Figure 3 ). Figure 3 Source: 2018 2017 2016 CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 13 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.2 Age, Gender and Race Distribution Importance of the measure: Population data broken down by age, gender, and race groups provide a foundation to analyze the issues and trends that impact demographic factors including economic growth and the distribution of healthcare services. Understanding the cultural diversity of communities is essential when considering health -care infrastructure and service delivery systems. Age Figure 4 illustrates the percentage of individuals in Livingston County in each age group. Note specifically, the 35- to-49-year s age group decreased 39% and the 50 to 64 age group increased 51.5%. The elderly population (residents aged 65 and older) increased 7% between 2015 and 2019 (Figure 4 ). Figure 4 Source: US Census Gender The gender distribution of Livingston County (Figure 5 ) residents has remained relatively consistent between 201 6 and 20 20. - 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 0-19 years 20-34 years 35-49 years 50-64 years 2017 2018 2019 CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 14 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 5 Source: US Census Race With regard to race and ethnic background, Livingston County is largely homogenous, yet in recent years, the county is becoming more diverse. Data from 201 9 suggest that White ethnicity comprises 88.7% of the population in Livingston County . However, the non- White population of Livingston County has been increasing (from 10.8% in 2017 to 11.3% in 201 9), with Black ethnicity comprising 4.3% of the population, multi- racial ethnicity comprising 1. 7% of the population, and Hispanic/Latino (Lati nX) ethnicity comprising 4.5% of the population in 2019 ( Figure 6 ). Black and African American Hispanic/Latino Asian Two or More Races American Indian/Alaska Native CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 15 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.3 Household/Family Importance of the measure: Families are an important component of a robust society in Livingston County , as they d ramatically impact the health and development of children and provide support and well -being for older adults. As indicated in Figure 7 , the number of family households in Livingston County de creased from 201 6 to 2019. Figure 7 Source: US Census Family Composition In Livingston County, data from 201 9 suggest the percentage of two -parent families in Livingston County is 49%. One -person households represent 3 4% of the county population a nd single- female households represent 12%, and single- male households represent 6% (Figure 8 ). 14,525 14,307 Number of 2016 2019 CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 16 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 8 Source: US Census Early Sexual Activity Leading to Births from Teenage Mothers Livingston County has experienced a fluctuation in teenage birth count . The teen birth count steadily declined since 2015 , but experienced an increase in 201 8 and 2019 ( Figure 9 ). Figure 9 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health 49% 12%6%34%Household Types Livingston County 2019 Two-parent Families Single Female Single Male Other Non-Family 9 7 49 9Teen Birth Livingston County 2015 -2019 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 17 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.4 Economic Information Importance of the measure: Median income divides households into two segments with one- half of households earning more than the median income and the other half earning less. Because median income is not significantly impacted by unusually high or low -income values, it is considered a more reliable indicator than average income. To live in poverty means to lack sufficient income to meet one's basic needs. Ac cordingly, poverty is associated with numerous chronic social, health, education and employment conditions. Economic Climate Economic climate is a measure of a community's financial resources and resiliency. Key risk influencers include income, cost of li ving and opportunity. For Livingston County , 21% of the population is at elevated risk for economic climate. This is low er than the State of Illinois average of 35% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). Median Income Level For 2019, the median household income in Livingston County was lower than the State of Illinois (Figure 10). Figure 10 Source: US Census Unemployment For the years 201 6 thru 2018 , the Livingston County unemployment rate remained lower than the State of Illinois unemployment rate. However, in 2020 the rate significantly increased but did remain lower than State of Illinois. Some of the increase in unemployment in 2020 may be attributed to the COVID -19 pandemic (Figure 11) . 55,160 65,886 Median Household Income (USD) Livingston County 2019 Livingston County State of Illinois CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 18 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 11 Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics Individuals in Poverty In Livingston County, the percentage of individuals living in poverty between 20 17 and 201 9 decreased by 0.30%. Poverty has a significant impact on the development of children and youth . In 2019 the poverty rate for families living in Livingston County (13%) was higher than the State of Illinois family poverty rate (11.4%) (Figure 12). Figure 12 Source: US Census Livingston of 13.3%13.0%11.4%Poverty Rate Livingston 2019 State of Illinois CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 19 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.5 Education Importance of the measure: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics1, \"The better educated a person is, the more likely that person is to report being in 'excellent' or 'very good' health, regardless of income.\" Research suggests that the higher the level of edu cational attainment and the more successful one is in school, the better one's health will be and the greater likelihood of one selecting healthy lifestyle choices. Accordingly, years of education is strongly related to an individual's propensity to earn a higher salary, gain better employment, and foster multifaceted success in life. High School Graduation Rates Students who entered 9th grade in 2017 in Livingston County school districts reported high school graduation rates that were mostly higher compa red to the State average of 8 6%. Pontiac HS reported a slightly lower than state averages at 84% ( Figure 13) . Figure 13 Source: Illinois Report Card 1.6 Internet Accessibility Survey respondents were asked if they had Internet access. Of respondents, 9 2% indicated they had Internet in their homes. For those who did not have Internet in their home, cost was the most frequently cited reason ( Figure 14) . Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percentages given the low number of responses. 1 NCES 2005 100% 87% 84%93% 91%94% 86%4-Year High School Graduation Rates (Students who entered 9th grade in 2017) Livingston County Dwight HS Flanagan-Cornell HS Pontiac HS Prairie Central HS Tri-Point HS Woodland HS State of Illinios CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 20 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 14 Source: CHNA Survey Digital Landscape Digital landscape is a community's access to digital tools and the digital literacy to use them. Key risk influencers include affordability, accessibility and digital literacy. For Livingston County, 45% of the population is at elevated risk for digital landscape. This is higher than the State of Illinois average of 9% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by Soci allyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). Social Determinants Related to Internet Access Several factors show significant relationships with an individual's Internet access. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Access to Internet tends to b e rated higher for younger people, those with higher education and those with higher income. Access to Internet was rated lower by Black people with an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. 26 109 3 1 1Causes of Inability to Have Internet in Home Livingston County 2022 Cost No Phone/Computer Don't know how Data limits Poor service No provider CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 21 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 1.7 Key Takeaways from Chapter 1 POPULATION DECREASED OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS.

Therefore, accessibility to healthcare must address both the associated financial costs and the supply and demand of medical services. Choice of Medical Care Survey respondents were asked to select the type of health -care facility used when sick. Six different alternatives were presented, including clinic or doctor's office, emergency department, urgent- care facility, health department, no medical treatment and other. The most common response for source of medical care was clinic/doctor's off ice, chosen by 80% of survey respondents. This was followed by not seeking medical attention ( 12%), urgent care ( 7%), the emergency department at a hospital ( 1%) and the health department (0%) (Figure 15 ). CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 23 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 15 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Clinic/doctor's office decreased (3%) and urgent care stayed the same. While emergency department usage decrease d (2%), there was a significant increase (6%) in people who didn't seek medical care when needed. Social Determinants Related to Choice of Medical Care Several factors show significant relationships with an individual's choice of medical care. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Clinic/Doctor's Office tends to be used more often by older people, White peo ple and those with higher education and higher income. Clinic/doctor's office tends to be less by Black people and people in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Do Not Seek Medical Care tends to be used by men, younger people, Black people and those with lower income. Given the low survey response rate for Black people, findings should be interpreted with caution. Urgent Care tends to be used more by those with higher education and higher income. Emergency Department tends to be used more by those with a lower education, and people in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Health Department did not have any significant correlates.

Only 4 % of respondents indicated they did not have any health insurance ( Figure 16). Figure 16 Source: CHNA Survey Data from the survey show that fo r the 4 % of individuals who do not have insurance, the most prevalent reason was cost ( Figure 17) . Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percentages given the low number of responses.

Social Determinants Related to Type of Insurance Several characteristics show significant relationships with an individual's type of insurance. The following relationships were found using correlational anal yses: Medicare tends to be used more frequently by older people, those with lower education and lower income. Medicaid tends to be used more frequently by LatinX people, those with lower education and those with lower income, and people with an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Commercial/Employer Insurance is used more often by younger people, White people, those with higher education, and those w ith higher income. Commercial/employer insurance is used less by people with an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. No Insurance tends to be reported more often by younger people, Black people, those with lower income, and people in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Given the low survey response rate for Black people, findings should be interpreted with caution. Access to Care In the CHNA survey, respondents were asked, \"Was there a time when you needed care but were not able to get it?\" Access to four types of care were assessed: medical care, prescription medication, dental care and counseling. Survey results show that 1 4% of the population did not have access to medical care when needed; 1 3% of the population did not have access to prescription medication when needed; 20% of the population did not have access to dental care when needed; and 11 % of the population did not have access to counseling when needed (Figure 18). CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 26 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 18 Source: CHNA Survey Social Determinants Related to Access to Care Several characteristics show a significant relationship with an individual's ability to access care when needed. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Access to medical care tends to be higher for those with higher income. Access to prescription medication tends to be higher for those with higher education. Access to prescription medication tends to be lower for Black people and people in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Given the low survey response rate for Black people, findings should be interpreted with caution. Access to d ental care tends to be higher for those with higher education and those with higher income. Access to counseling tends to be higher for older people, those with higher education, and those with higher income. Access to counseling tends to be lower for p eople in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Reasons for No Access - Medical Care Survey respondents who reported they were not able to get medical care when needed were asked a follow -up question. The leading causes of the inability to gain access to medical care were too long to wait for an appointment ( 39) (Figure 19 ). Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percentages given the low number of responses.

Transportation Network Transportation network is a measure of the adequacy of the transportation network to facilitate access to care . Key risk influencers include access and proximity to resources. While survey data indicate transportation was not a leading cause of inaccessibility, for Livingston Count y, 28% of the population is at elevated risk for transportation network . This is hi gher than the State of Illinois average of 6% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). 26 19 19 13 7 7 5 3 3Causes of Inability to Access Counseling Livingston County 2022 Wait Too Long Could Not Find No Trust Could Not Afford Co-Pay Embarrassment Transportation Counselor Refused Insurance No Insurance Discrimination CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 30 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 2.2 Wellness Importance of the measure: Preventative health -care measures, including getting a flu shot, engaging in a healthy lifestyle and undertaking screenings for diseases are essential to combating morbidity and mortality while reducing health -care costs. Frequency of Flu Shots The ove rall health of a community is impacted by preventative measures including immunizations and vaccinations. Figure 23 shows that the percentage of people who have had a f lu shot in the past year is 31.7% for Livingston County in 201 5-2019 compared to the State at 34 .5%. Note that data have not been updated by the Illinois Department of Public Health. Figure 23 Source: CHNA Survey COVID -19 Vacci nations Figure 24 shows that the percentage of people who have been fully vaccinated from the COVID -19 viru s. Livingston County remains under the rate for the State of Illinois . Additionally, given the recency of the COVID -19 virus, no historical comparisons are made at this time.

Social Determinants Related to Having a Personal Physician The following characteristics show significant relationships with having a personal physician. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Having a personal physician tends to be higher for older people and those with higher income. Having a personal physician tends to be lower for people in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment Cancer Screening Early detection of cancer may greatl y improve the probability of successful treatment. In the case of colorectal cancer, early detection of precancerous polyps can prevent cancer. Specifically, four types of cancer screening were measured: breast, cervical, prostate and colorectal. Results f rom the CHNA survey show that 72% of women had a breast screening in the past five years and 63% of women had a cervical screening. For men, 39% had a prostate screening in the past five years. For women and men over the age of 50, 59% had a colorectal screening in the last five years (Figure 26) . Figure 26 Source: CHNA Survey 72% 63% 39%59%Cancer Screening in Past 5 years Livingston County 2022 Breast (for women) Cervical (for women) Prostate (for men) Colorectal (over age 50) CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 33 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Comparison to 2019 CHNA Cancer screening increased from 2019 to 2022. Specifically, in 2019, 79 % of women had a breast screening in the past five years compared to 72% in 2022. For men, in 2019 53% reported t hey had a prostate screening in the past five years compared to 39% in 2022. For women and men over the age of 50, 68% had a colorectal screening in the last five years in 2019, compared to 59% in 2022. Note this was the first year that cervical screening was measured, so there is no comparison to 2019. Social Determinants Related to Cancer Screenings Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with cancer screening. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Breast screening tends to be more likely for older women, White women, those with a higher level of education and higher income. Cervical screening tends to be more likely f or older women, White women, those with a higher level of education and higher income. LatinX women and people in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment are less likely to have a cervical screening. Prostate screening tends to be more likely for older men, those with a higher income. Colorectal screening tends to be more likely for White people. Colorectal screening tends to be less likely for LatinX people. Physical Exercise A healthy lifestyle, comprised of regular physical activity, has been shown to increase physical, mental, and emotional well -being. CHNA survey data allow for a more detailed assessment of exercise. Specifically, 2 8% of respondents indicated that they do not exercise at all, while the majority ( 57%) of resident's exercise 1 -5 times per week (Figure 27 ). CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 34 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 27 Source: CHNA Survey To find out why some residents do not exercise at all, a follow up question was asked. Similar to the 2019 CHNA, the most common re asons for not exercising are not having enough energy ( 25%), dislike of exercise ( 21%) and not enough 21%) ( Figure 28) . Figure 28 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Frequency of exercise has remained relatively consistent since 2019. 28%31% 26% 15%Days Exercised in Last Week Livingston County 2022 I Don't 1 to 2 days per week 3 to 5 days per week More than 5 per week 25% 21% 21% 12%11% 6%4%Reasons Did Not Exercise in Last Week Livingston County 2022 Too tired Don't like No time Safety Connot afford Access Child care CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 35 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Social Determinants Related to Exercise There were no significant relationships with frequency of exercise. Frequency of exercise tends to be rated higher by those with a higher level of education and those with higher income. Healthy Eating A healthy lifestyle, comprised of a proper diet, has been shown to increase physical, mental and emotional well -being. Consequently, nutrition and diet are critical to preventative care. Almost two- thirds (6 6%) of residents report no consumption or low consumption (1 -2 servings per day) of fruits and vegetables per day. Note that the percentage of residents who consume five or more servings per day is only 4 % (Figure 29 ). Figure 29 Source: CHNA Survey Those individuals who indicated they do not eat any fruits or vegetables were asked a follow up question. The reasons most frequently given for failing to eat more fruits and vegetables was it is not important (19) (Figure 30 ). Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percentages given the low number of responses. 7%59% 30% 4%Daily Consumption of Fruits and Vegetables Livingston County 2022 I Don't 1 to 2 3 to 5 More than 5 CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 36 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 30 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Resu lts show a significant increase (12%) in those with low consumption of fruits and vegetables per day (0 -2) compared to 2019. Social Determinants Related to Healthy Eating Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with healthy eating. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Consumption of fruits and vegetables tends to be more likely for LatinX people, those with higher education and those with higher income. Consumption of fruits and vegetables tends to be lowe r for people in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Restricted Diet Respondents were also asked if they followed a restricted diet if recently diagnosed with a morbidity. Of respondents, 37% usually or always follow a restricted diet ( Figure 31) . 19 10 8 3 10 0Reasons Do Not Eat Fruits and Vegetables Livingston County 2022 Not important Cannot afford I don't like Cannot prepare Transportation No refridgerator/stove CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 37 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 31 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results show a significant decrease (8%) in those who usually or always follow a restricted diet compared to 2019. Health Literacy Health literacy is a measure of factors in the community that impact healthcare access, navigation and adherence. Key risk influencers include culture, demographics and educatio n. For Livingston County, 30% of the population is at elevated risk for health literacy . This is lower than the State of Illinois average of 34% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022) Insecurity Importance of the meas ure: It is essential that everyone has access to food and drink necessary for living healthy lives. Food insecurity exists when people don't have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for a heal thy life. Prevalence of Hunger Respondents were asked, \"How many days a week do you or your family members go hungry?\" The vast majority of respondents indicated they do not go hungry, however, 3 % indicated they go hungry 1 -2 days per week (Figure 32 ). 18%45% 30% 7%Follow A Restricted Diet Livingston Sometimes Usually Always CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 38 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 32 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results show a 2 % decrease compared to 2019 CHNA results for those who go hungry. Social Determinants Related to Prevalence of Hunger Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with hunger. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Prevalence of Hunger tends to be more likely for those with less education and those with less income. Primary Source of Food Respondents were asked to identify their primary source of food. It can be seen that the majority ( 88%) identified a grocery store (Figure 33). 97% 3%0%How Often Go Hungry Livingston County 2022 None 1 to 2 days per week 3 to 5 days per week CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 39 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 33 Source: CHNA Survey Food Landscape Food landscape is a measure of the conditions that affect the ability of residents to access health, affordable nutrition. Key risk influencers include accessibility, affordability and literacy. For Livingston County , 50% of the population is at elevated risk for food landscape . This is higher than the State of Illinois average of 25% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). 2.4 Physical Environment Importance of the measure: According to the County Health Rankings, Air Pollution - Particulate Matter (APPM) is the average daily density of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) in a county. Fine particulate matter is defined as particles of air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. These particles can be directly em itted from sources such as forest fires, or they can form when gases are emitted from power plants, manufacturing facilities and automobiles. The relationship between elevated air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter and ozone, and compromised h ealth has been well documented. Negative consequences of ambient air pollution include decreased lung function, chronic bronchitis, asthma and other adverse pulmonary effects. The APPM for Livingston County (1 1.6) is slightly higher than the State average of 1 1.5 (Figure 34). 88% 4% 3% 2% 2% 1%0%Primary Source of Food 2022 Grocery Store Food pantry Fast food Farm/garden Food delivery Convenience store Gas station CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 40 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 34 Source: C ounty Health Rankings 2021 2.5 Health Status Importance of the measure: Self-perceptions of health can provide important insights to help manag e population health. Not only do self -perceptions provide benchmarks regarding health status, but they can also provide insights into how accurately people perceive their own health. Mental Health The survey asked respondents to indicate specific issues, such as depression and stress/anxiety. Of respondents, 5 4% indicated they did not feel depressed in the last 30 days (Figure 35) and 5 8% indicated they did not feel anx ious or stressed (Figure 36 ). 11.6 11.5Air Pollution -Particulate Matter Livingston County 2020 Livingston County State of Illinois CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 41 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 35 Source: CHNA Survey Figure 36 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results show a decline in mental health.

In this way, health -care organizations can target affected populations more effectively. Research suggests tobacco use facilitates a wide variety of adverse medical conditions. CHNA survey data show 8 6% of respondents do not smoke ( Figure 41 ) and 96% of respondents do not vape (Figure 42) . Only 5% smoke more than 12 times per day. Figure 41 Source: CHNA Survey 86% 3% 3% 3%5%Frequency of Smoking Livingston County 2022 None 1 to 4 times per day 5 to 8 times per day 9 to 12 times per day More than 12 times per day CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 47 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 42 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results improved between 2019 and 2022, where 83% of people did not smoke in 2019 and 86% do not smoke in 2022. Social Determ inants Related to Smoking or Vaping Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with smoking or vaping. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Smoking tends to be rated higher by younger people, non- White people, those with less education and a lower income, and those in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Vaping tends to be rated higher by younger people and those with less education. 3.2 Drug and Alcohol Abuse Importance of the measure: Alcohol and drugs impair decision- making, often leading to adverse consequences and outcomes. Research suggests that alcohol is a gateway drug for youth, leading to increased usage of controlled substances in adult years. Accordingly, the substance abuse v alues and behaviors of high school students is a leading indicator of adult substance abuse in later years. Youth Substance Abuse Data from the 2020 Illinois Youth Survey measures illegal substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs - mainly marijuana) among adolescents. Livingston County data reported for 2020, State Illinois 1% 0% 1%Frequency of Vaping Livingston County 2022 None 1 to 4 times per day 5 to 8 times per day 9 to 12 times per day More than 12 times per day CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 48 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 reporting 2018 data. As Figure 43 illustrates, Livingston County came in below State of Illinois averages for alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana. Livingston County rated higher than State averages for inhalants among 8th grader s. Figure 43 Source: University of Illinois Center for Prevention Research and Development Among 1 2th graders, the most recent data available Livingston County is 2020 and State of Illinois data is 2018.

Illegal substance use had no significant correlates. 3.3 Overweight and Obesity Importance of the measure: Individuals who are overweight and obese place greater stress on their internal organs, thus increasing the propensity to utilize health services. Research strongly suggests th at obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Illinois, and within Livingston County . The US Surgeon General has characterized obesity as \"the fastest- growing, most threatening disease in America today.\" According to the Obesity Prevention Initiative from the Illinois General Assembly, 20% of Illinois children are obese. The financial burden of overweight and obese individuals is staggering, as the estimated annual medical costs attributed to obesity in Illinois for 1998 -2000 exceeded $3.4 billion, ranking Illinois 6th in the nation for obesity -attributed medical costs. With children, research has linked obesity to numerous chronic diseases including Type II diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure, and asthma. Adverse physical health side effects of obesity include orthopedic problems due to weakened joints and lower bone density. Detrimental mental health side effects include low self -esteem, poor body image, symptoms of depression and suicide ideation. Obesity impac ts educational performance as well; studies suggest school absenteeism of obese children is six times higher than that of non- obese children. With adults, obesity has far -reaching consequences. Testimony to the Illinois General Assembly indicated that obesity -related illnesses contribute to worker absenteeism, slow workflow, and high worker compensation rates. A Duke University study on the effects of obesity in the workforce noted 13 times more missed workdays by obese employees than non- obese employees. Nationwide, lack of physical activity and poor nutrition contribute to an estimated 300,000 preventable deaths per year. In Livingston County, the number of people diagnosed with obesity and being overweight has increased over the years from 2010- 2014 to 2015- 2019. Note specifically that the percentage of obese and overweight people has increased from 70.0% to 71.0% (Figure 49 ). Overweight and obesity rates in Illinois have increased from 2015 (63.7%) to 2019 (65.7%). Note that data have not been updated by the Illinois Department of Public Health. However, note in the 2019 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that being overweight was their most prevalently diagnosed health condition .

Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions and do not reflect outpatient treatments and procedures. 4.1 Self -Identified Health Conditions Survey respondents were asked to self -identify any health conditions. Note that being overweight (29%) was significantly higher than any other health conditions. This percentage is significantly lower than secondary sources. Specifically, BRFSS data indicate that over two -thirds of the population is overweight or obese ( Figure 53). Most other self -identified morbidities reflected existing sources of secondary data accurately (e.g., diabetes 10%). CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 56 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 53 Source: CHNA Survey 4.2 Healthy Babies Importance of the measure: Regular prenatal care is a vital aspect in producing healthy babies and children. Screening and treatment for medical conditions as well as identification and interventions for behavioral risk factors associated with poor birth outcomes are important aspects of healthy babies. Research suggests that women who receive adequate prenatal care are more likely to have better birth outcomes, such as full term and normal weight babies. Low Birth Weight Rates Low birth weight rate is defined as the percentage o f infants born below 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds. Very low birth weight rate is defined as the percentage of infants born below 1,500 grams or 3.3 pounds. In contrast, the average newborn weighs about 7 pounds. The percentage of babies born with low birth weight in Livingston County has remained has remained constant with a slight decrease in 2018 (7.0%) (Figure 54) . 29% 22% 12%10%9%7%6% 4%1%Health Conditions Livingston County Overweight Allergy health Diabetes Asthma/COPD Heart Memory Cancer Stroke CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 57 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 54 Source: County Health Ranking s 4.3 Cardiovascular Disease Importance of the measure: Cardiovascular disease is defined as all diseases of the heart and blood vessels, including ischemic (also known as coronary) heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, hypertensive disease and atherosclerosis. Coronary Atherosclerosis Coronary Atheroscl erosis, sometimes -called hardening of the arteries, can slowly narrow and harden the arteries throughout the body. When atherosclerosis affects the arteries of the heart, it is called coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of d eath for Americans. Most of these deaths are from heart attacks caused by sudden blood clots in the heart's arteries. The number of cases of coronary atherosclerosis complication at Livingston County area hospitals has been low, with 1 case reported in 201 9 and 3 cases reported in 2020. Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions and do not reflect out- patient treatments and procedures . Cardiac Arrest Cases of dysrhythmia and cardiac arrest at Livingston County area hospitals decreased by 2 cases between 2019 and 2020 ( Figure 55 ).

These conditions are characterized by breathlessness, wheezing, chronic coughing, frequent respiratory infections and chest tightnes s. Many respiratory conditions can be successfully controlled with medical supervision and treatment. However, children and adults who do not have access to adequate medical care are likely to experience repeated serious episodes, trips to the emergency r oom and absences from school and work. Hospitalization rates illustrate the worst episodes of respiratory diseases and are a proxy measure for inadequate treatment. Asthma The percentage of residents who have been diagnosed with asthma increased in Livingston County has decreased between 20 10-2014 and 201 5-2019 , while State averages also de creas ed. According to the Illinois BRFSS, asthma rates in Livingston County ( 7.9%) are lower than the State of Illinois ( 8.2%) (Figure 59) .

Figure 61 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health - Cancer in Illinois 4.6 Diabetes Importance of the measure: Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney fai lure, adult blindness and amputations and is a leading contributor to strokes and heart attacks. It is estimated that 90 -95% of individuals with diabetes have Type II diabetes (previously known as adult- onset diabetes). Only 5 -10% of individuals with diabetes have Type I diabetes (previously known as juvenile diabetes). Inpatient cases of Type II diabetes from Livingston County de creased between 20 19 (30 cases) and 20 20 (22 cases ) (Figure 62).

It would be highly cost -effective for both individuals and society if more programs focused on prevention rather than treatment of infectious diseases. Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Cases The data for the number of infections of chlamydia in Livingston C ounty from 201 8-2019 indicate a significant decrease . There is also an increase of incidence of chlamydia across the State of Illinois. (Figure 65) . Rates of chlamydia in Livingston County are lower than State averages.

According to the Illinois Public Health Department, the most common and serious vaccine- preventable diseases are: Varicella measles), Diphtheria, Hepatitis B and Hemo philic Influenza Type B (HIB) Infections. These diseases used to strike thousands of children each year. Today there are relatively few cases, but outbreaks still occur each year because some babies are not immunized. Livingston County has shown no significant outbreaks compared to state statistics, but there are limited data available ( Table 1 and Table 2 ). Note data has not been updated by the State beyond years displayed in tables . Also note that COVID -19 vaccine rates are presented in Chapter 2.

These injuries are often indicative of serious mental health problems requiring the treatment of other trauma- inducing issues. Unintentional injuries can occur, in part, from violent crimes. CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 67 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Suicide The number of suicides in Livingston County indicate higher incidence than State of Illinois averages, as there were approximately 21.1 suicides per 100,000 people in Livingston County from 2016- 2018, compared to the State average of 11.3 suicides per 100, 000 people ( Figure 67) . Figur e 67 Source: Illinois Department of Public Healt h Violent Crimes Violent crimes are defined as offenses that involve face- to-face confrontation between the victim and the perpetrator, including homicide, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 70 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 CHAPTER 5 OUTLINE 5.1 Perceptions of Health Issues 5.2 Perceptions of Unhealthy Behavior 5.3 Perceptions of Issues with Well Being 5.4 Summary of Community Health Issues 5.5 Community Resources 5.6 Significant Needs Identified and Prioritized CHAPTER 5 : PRIORITIZATION OF HEALTH -RELATED ISSUES In this chapter, the most critical health -related needs in the community are identified. To accomplish this, community perceptions of health issues, unhealthy behaviors and issues related to well -being were first considered. Key takeaways from each chapter were then used to identify important health -related issues in the community. Next, a comprehensive inventory of community resources was completed; and finally, the most significant health needs in the community are prioritized. Specific criteria used to identify these issues included: (1) magnitude in the community; (2) severity in the community; (3) potential for impact to the community. 5.1 Perceptions of Health Issues The CHNA survey asked respondents to rate the three most important health issues in the community. Respondents had a choice of 11 different options. Note that respondents could choose up to three health issues, so total percentages can be greater than 100. The health issue that rated highest was mental health (21%), followed by obesity (17%) and c ancer (17%) . The t hree facto rs were significantly higher than other categories based on t- tests between sample means (Figure 69) . Note that perceptions of the community were accurate in some cases. For example, mental health issues are significantly increasing . Also, obesity and cancer are significant issues in the community . The survey respondents accurately identified these as important health issues. However, some perceptions were inaccurate. For example, while heart disease is a leading cause of mortality, it is ranked relatively low. CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 71 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 69 Source: CHNA Survey 5.2 Perceptions of Unhealthy Behaviors Respondents were asked to select the three most important unhealthy behaviors in the community out of a total of 10 choices. The highest rated unhealthy behavior is drug abuse (illegal) at 2 1% (Figure 70).

These two factors were significantly higher than other categories based on t-tests between sample means . Figure 71 Source: CHNA Survey 5.4 Summary of Community Health Issues Based on findings from the previous analyses, a chapter -by-chapter summary of key takeaways is used to provide a foundation for identification of the most important h ealth -related issues in the community. Considerations for identifying key takeaways include magnitude in the community, strategic importance to the community, existing community resources and potential for impact and trends and future forecasts. Demograph ics (Chapter 1) - Three factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the demographic analyses: Population decreased Population over age 50 increased Single female head -of-house -household represents 12% of the population Prevention Behaviors (Chapter 2) - Six factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on prevention behaviors: Access to healthcare COVID -19 vaccination rates Prostate cancer screening is very low Exercise and healthy eating behaviors 0%1%4%5%7%8%8%13%13%20%21%Perceptions of Issues that Impact Well Being Livingston County 2022 Healthy Food Choices Access to Healthcare Job Opportunities Less Hatred Affordable Clean Housing Safer Neighborhoods Available Child Care Public Transportation Less Violence Less Poverty Better School Attendance CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 73 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Health l iteracy Depression and stress/anxiety Symptoms and Predictors (Chapter 3) - Three factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on symptoms and predictors: Substance abuse among youth Opioid abuse Overweight and obesity Morbidity and Mortality (Chapter 4) - Three factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on morbidity/mortality behaviors: Cancer rates - breast, prostate, lung Suicide rates Cancer, heart disease and COVID -19 are the leading causes of mortality Potential Hea lth-Related Needs Considered for Prioritization Before the prioritization of significant community health -related needs was performed, results were aggregated into 8 potential categories. Based on similarities and duplication, the 8 potential areas conside red are: Aging issues Healthy behaviors - nutrition & exercise Behavioral health Overweight/Obesity Opioid abuse COVID -19 Cancer screening and rates Health Literacy 5.5 Community Resources After summarizing potential categories for prioritization in the Community Health Needs Assessment, a comprehensive analysis of existing community resources was performed to identify the efficacy to which these 8 health -related areas were being addressed. A resource matrix can be seen in APPENDIX 5 : RESOURCE MATRIX relating to the 8 health -related issues. There are numerous forms of resources in the community. They are categorized as recreational facilities, county health departments, community agencies and area hospitals/clinics. A detailed list of community resources and descriptions appears in APPENDIX 6 : DESCRIPTION OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES . CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 74 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 5.6 Significant Needs Identified and Prioritized In order to prioritize the previously identified dimensions, the collaborative team considered health needs based on: (1) magnitude of the is sues (e.g., what percentage of the population was impacted by the issue); (2) severity of the issues in terms of their relationship with morbidities and mortalities; (3) potential impact through collaboration. Using a modified version of the Hanlon Method (as seen in APPENDIX 7: PRIORITIZATION METHODOLOGY ), the collaborative team identified two significant health needs and considered them equal priorities: Healthy Behaviors - defined as active living and healthy eating, and their impact on obesity Health y Aging Healthy Behaviors ACTIVE LIVING . A healthy lifestyle, comprised of regular physical activity and balanced diet, has been shown to increase physical, mental and emotional well -being. Note that 28% of respondents indicated that they do not exercise at all, while the majority (57%) of resid ents exercise 1 -5 times per week. The most common reason s for not exercising are not having enough energy (25%), dislike of exercise (21%), or no time (21%). HEALTHY EATING . Almost two- thirds (66%) of residents report no consumption or low consumption (1 - 2 servings per day) of fruits and vegetables per day. Note that the percentage of residents who consume five or more servings per day is only 4%. The most prevalent reason for failing to eat more fruits and vegetables was a perceived lack of importance. OBESITY. In Livingston County, almost three- quarters (71%) of residents were diagnosed with obesity and being overweight. In the 2022 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that being overweight was the second most important health issue and was rated as the most prevalently diagnosed health condition. Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Illinois, and within Livingston County. The U.S. Surgeon General has characterized obesity as \"the fas test- growing, most threatening disease in America today.\" According to the Obesity Prevention Initiative from the Illinois General Assembly, 20% of Illinois children are obese. With children, research has linked obesity to numerous chronic diseases including Type II diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure and asthma. Adverse physical health side effects of obesity include orthopedic problems due to weakened joints and lower bone density. Detrimental mental health side effects include low self -esteem, poor body image, symptoms of depression and suicide ideation. Obesity impacts educational performance as well; studies suggest school absenteeism of obese children is six times higher than that of non- obese children. With adults, obesity has far -reaching consequences. Testimony to the Illinois General Assembly indicated that obesity -related illnesses contribute to worker absenteeism, slow workflow, and high worker compensation rates. A Duke University study on the effects of obesity in the workforce noted 13 times more missed workdays by obese employees than non- obese employees. Nationwide, lack of physical activity and poor nutrition contribute to an estimated 300,000 preventable deaths per year. CHNA 2022 | Livingston Count y 75 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Healthy Aging In the CHNA survey, respondents rated aging issues (6%) as the eighth most important health issue. The percentage of individuals aged 50 to 64 increased by 51.5% and the percentage of individuals 65 and older increased by 7.0% between 2015 and 2019. In Livingston County, 6% of survey respondents indicated being diagnosed with memory problems. Alzheimer's disease was the 8th leading cause of death in Livingston County in 2020. Illinois is projected to see an 18.2% increase in Alzheimer's disease incidence between 2018 and 2025. Alzheimer's and dementia care in the U.S. will cost an estimated $277 billion. According to a 2015 study, the average cost of dementia care (over a five- year period) was $287,038, compared to $175,136 (heart disease) and $173,383 (cancer).
