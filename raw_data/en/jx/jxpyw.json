However, she also remembered vividly that a Red Cross worker appeared in front of her and gave her a little candy while waiting at JFK airport, and it gave her a sense of relief. That is the moment she wanted to recreate for others. Years later, she became a successful marker in Japan and received several awards, such as Forbes Japan 100 Top Women 2018. However, she still felt empty inside. One day, she heard from her friend that there were not many sweets available for her because she is vegan and they have to be gluten-free due to Celiac disease. Then she came up with an idea. Most Japanese desserts are vegan, gluten-free, and visually appealing; this was her chance to replicate the comfort she experienced at JFK airport, so she created sweets that bring happiness to people to achieve the peaceful world that she envisioned. <Manufacturing method> I am cautious to avoid any contamination, including COVID-19.
