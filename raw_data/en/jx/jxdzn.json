First of all, it's not actually the person that's toxic. Rather, what you dislike and are sensitive to is their energetic X. Let me explain more. All people are inherently good. Their natural essence is love energy. However, as we move through Earth School, which, in case you didn't notice, is pretty tough stuff. We can adopt thoughts, collect unprocessed emotional energy and slip into unhealthy habits, which all impacts our overall frequency. The toxicity we recognize in others is more accurately, like a toxicity cloud hovering around them. It's an energetic byproduct of living a low frequency life. The toxicity cloud is created like this. Negative thinking easily spirals in tow. Uncomfortable emotions, which produces more negative thoughts, resulting in more painful emotions. Under the weight of this pain, there's an attempt to find comfort. It's easier to choose actions or substances that provide ah, quick relief from the discomfort instead of following ones highest good. This pattern eventually establishes into a habit. As unhealthy habits continue to form, the toxicity cloud grows darker and more dense. It can even attract negative external energies, which make themselves at home in this low frequency environment, but it's important to remember that the person's divine light is still present. They are a good, whole amazing human being, but their light is being dimmed by the toxicity cloud, and although it is very uncomfortable to be around a toxicity cloud, it's far worse to be inside it. This heavy energy becomes the filter through which they experience the world. It skews how they see and interpret life events, putting a much darker tint on everything. It can cause great suffering and be quite painful to live underneath a toxicity cloud in the next lesson. All explain how you know if you're being impacted by toxicity cloud or if you may be hosting one yourself, see in the next lesson. 3.
