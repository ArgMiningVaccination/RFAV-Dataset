Sreynet is one of 20 medical personnel at the hospital taking part in a three-week seminar about acupuncture and Tuina remedial massage, held at the hospital's Chinese Medicine Clinic in Phnom Penh. \"I have wanted to learn about traditional Chinese medicine for a long time and, now, I have a chance to study it,\" she said while attending the first day of the seminar. \"I hope to gain a better insight into acupuncture and Tuina remedial massage after this seminar.\" She says that TCM has been used to diagnose, cure and prevent illness, and it also reduces the use of modern medicine. \"There has been a remarkable increase in the number of patients coming for TCM treatment, and many of them have recovered,\" Sreynet says. Held in a hybrid format, the seminar is part of a project carried out by the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine to train people in acupuncture and Tuina remedial massage in developing countries. Koeurng Raksmiy, a Cambodian doctor at the friendship hospital's Chinese Medicine Clinic, says that TCM can help treat a number of diseases such as osteoporosis, insomnia, infertility, pain, chronic cough, bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease. \"TCM, which includes therapies such as gua sha massage treatment, acupuncture and cupping, is very useful in treating illnesses,\" he says. \"Through the seminar, we gain an insight into TCM treatment methods, particularly acupuncture techniques.\" Raksmiy says that, since it was launched in March 2022, the friendship hospital's Chinese Medicine Clinic has received more than 6,000 patients. \"In general, they have recovered, and some patients said that the TCM treatment has helped them reduce the use of modern medicine,\" he says. Wu Zhaomei, a member of the TCM anti-COVID-19 pandemic team in Cambodia, says the seminar focused on basic theories and operational methods of acupuncture, moxibustion and Tuina, as well as TCM nursing techniques. \"We are happy to find that doctors and nurses in this hospital are interested in TCM. That's why we want to improve their knowledge and ability to practice it,\" she says. Wu says more than a dozen TCM experts, who are experienced in both the clinic and at teaching the subject, gave lectures during the three-week seminar. \"TCM treats many common illnesses effectively, and we want to share this with them,\" she says. \"We expect that doctors and nurses at the friendship hospital can learn more about the practices of acupuncture and Tuina, as well as nursing techniques.\" Xinhua "}
