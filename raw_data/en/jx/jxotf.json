But with so many options - massages, sauna sessions, yoga classes, skin treatments, etc - it can add up pretty quickly; both for your wallet and for your busy schedule. As a functional medicine practitioner I've studied the benefits of different wellness tools and have seen great results with myself and my patients from some of the most simple options. In fact, there are so many practices that can be done from the comfort of your own home that have just as powerful of an impact as some of these other choices. These are some of my favorite feel-good wellness practices, which I'd recommend adding to your routine to support your body and mind. 1. Foam rolling If you're experiencing muscle pain but can't afford regular massage or need additional relief between appointments, foam rolling is an easy way to get similar benefits to a massage. Research has shown that foam rolling can [relieve muscle pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4299735/) (1) and [increase flexibility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25883869) (2); in fact, it may even help relieve stress, according to a study on 20 women published in the [Journal of Physical Therapy Science](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4242954/) (3). It's the perfect self-care practice to release aches and pains. 2. Epsom salt baths Epsom salt baths are one of my favorite ways to destress, detox, and relieve tension. They're also a great way to give your body a much-needed dose of magnesium, which is often referred to as the \"relaxation mineral.\" Epsom salts are just magnesium sulfate salts, so they provide many of the same benefits as magnesium, which many of us are deficient in. Deficiencies in magnesium can stress the body and contribute to headaches, anxiety, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, and even constipation. If you're looking for other ways to increase your magnesium intake, read my [expert guide to magnesium](https://drwillcole.com/functional-medicine/having-enough-magnesium).

It's incredibly simple and you can do it anywhere \u2014 while you're cooking, working, cleaning, or even showering. All you have to do is breathe in for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and then exhale for 8 seconds. This type of breathing causes your body to immediately enter a more relaxed state and has almost endless benefits. In fact, a [review article](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Stress-management-techniques%3A-evidence-based-that-Varvogli-Darviri/69e1ce17641b1d6b3b8c1cb3079ad741f3c9cb82) (4) published in 2011 showed that this type of breathing can: - Reduce fatigue - Reduce asthma symptoms - Bolster stress management - Reduce hypertension - Reduce anxiety - Reduce aggressive behavior - Improve migraines Hopefully, that convinces you to give it a try. Here's [a video](https://www.drweil.com/videos-features/videos/breathing-exercises-4-7-8-breath/) showing you exactly how to do it. 4. Herbal tea There's nothing more comforting than a hot drink. That's where herbal tea comes in. It's one of my favorite beverages to sip on throughout the day. Herbal tea is inexpensive, easy to prepare, and naturally sugar- and caffeine-free. There's also [a ton of variety](https://drwillcole.com/functional-medicine/your-go-to-guide-to-the-wonderful-world-of-tea), so you'll never get bored. Try peppermint if you're feeling fatigued, ginger if your stomach feels restless, and chamomile if you're feeling the urge to snack late at night. You can brew some hibiscus tea and then ice it or mix two different flavors together. The possibilities are endless. 5. A Manuka honey mask Stress can cause our skin health to suffer, increasing dryness, inflammation, and making us more prone to breakouts. Enter: manuka honey \u2014 my [favorite type of honey](https://drcoleoldsite.wpengine.com/everything-need-know-honey-health-benefits/) and one of nature's best all-natural skin remedies. Manuka honey has strong anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties; it's even being studied in a medical setting as a treatment for [wounds and burns](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11702616) (5). To use it as a face-mask, just apply a medium-thin layer to your face and leave it on for 10 minutes. Then, wash it off with warm water. You can also add a teaspoon of Manuka honey to your herbal tea if you're craving something sweet.
