She studied at The British College of Osteopathic Medicine (UK).", "sitename": "Theroundclinic", "date": "2020-01-08", "cleaned_text": "Italy, but relocated to the UK at an early age, Giulia graduated from The British College of Osteopathic Medicine in 2016. Since then she has had the pleasure of working alongside other Osteopaths, as well as Naturopaths, Dietitians, and Dentists. This experience had made her practice a varied approach - which is always patient-centered. It also developed her interest in the jaw and the relationship with the spine and posture, as well as women's and children's health plus dietetics. Her philosophy is to address the issue at hand while providing tools so that the issue does not return. She believes the best results can be achieved through lifestyle change and exercise, while looking at structure and function. Guilia is registered with the General Osteopathic Council, the Institute of Osteopathy, the British Naturopathy Association and the HK Osteopathic Association. \"Giulia is amazing! So perceptive and intuitive, with magical hands! She has made such a difference to my back pain after having a baby. I cannot recommend her enough! Thank you, Giulia!\" - Lorene \"I cannot speak highly enough about Giulia; she's an outstanding osteopath! I have been seeing her for almost a year and find her cross-cultural influences unique to treating my back, shoulder and elbow - strained from carrying my young kids and from a sports injury. She also equips me with new knowledge every time, which I find very special!\" - Kenny \"Giulia is very nice and professional. She took the time to listen to me to understand the origin of my issues and explain the process we will follow to fix it. She is very friendly and empathic. I would highly recommend her!\" - Sonia "}
