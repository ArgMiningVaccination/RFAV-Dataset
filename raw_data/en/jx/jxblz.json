Introduction Alignment with National Education Standards Oregon Standards reflect the National Health Education Standards and the National Sexuality Education Standa rds that focus on knowledge and skill development for health literacy. The Oregon Standards has specific grade level requirements that outline what students should know and be able to do by the end of specified grades and serve as a valuable tool for schoo ls in selecting, designing, or revising curriculum and instruction. Skills 2-8 focus on the practices necessary for students to maintain and promote individual, family, and community health. Knowledge and skills are interwoven in each topic area throughout K-12. K nowledge & Skills Based on the National Standards for Health Education K nowledge 1 : Students comprehend functional health knowledge to enhance health. Skill 2 : Students analyze the influence of family, peers, culture, social media, technology, and other determinants on health behaviors. Skill 3 : Students demonstrate health literacy by accessing valid and reliable health information, products, and services to enhance health. Skill 4 : Students demonstrate effective interpersonal communication sk ills to enhance health. Skill 5 : Students demonstrate effective decision -making skills to enhance health.

Page 3 August, 2023 Structure and Organization Oregon's Health Education Standards are organized into topic areas that allow for students to gain knowledge and skil ls in core health topics, aligning with Oregon Statutes and Administrative Rules , CDC Health Education priorities , and informed by the Oregon's Student Health Survey . Topic areas provi de for groupings that can serve districts and educators to develop units of learning experiences. These topics are subdivided into subtopics that are vertically aligned throughout the K -12 grade level standards to ensure a progression of learning that prepares students for a lifetime of well -being and informed decision -making. For a complete list of subtopics, please see Appendix A . T opic Areas 1.W ellness and Health Promotion 2.Safety and First Aid 3.Substance Use, Misuse, and Abuse 4.Food, Nutrition, and Physical Activity 5.Social, Emotional, and Mental Health 6.Healthy Relationships and Violence/Abuse Prevention 7.Growth and Development 8.Sexual and Reproductive Health Integrated Transformative Social Emotional Learning (TSEL) Standards The Health Education Standards were developed with Oregon's Transformational Social Emotional Learning (TSEL) Standards in mind. These two sets of Standards create a comprehensive educational framework that provides schools with a cohesive roadmap to nurture students' holistic development, equipping them with essential life skills in a nd beyond the classroom. At each grade level, TSEL Practices are mapped to connect TSEL standards with health topics. Each TSEL Practice is labeled in this document, and has its own corresponding growth indicators that provide guidance on what learning opportunities can look like in practice. Page 4 August, 2023 II.
