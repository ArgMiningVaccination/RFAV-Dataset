Vitamin D may have a role in the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the evolving acquired immunity against it. We tested the correlation between baseline 25(OH) D content and both the reinfection rate and the anti-spike protein antibody titer following COVID-19 infection. Methods A retrospective observational survey that included a large convalescent COVID-19 population of subjects insured by the Leumit HMO was recorded between 1 February 2020 and 30 January 2022. Inclusion criteria required at least one available 25(OH)D level prior to enlistment. The association between 25(OH)D levels, the rate of breakthrough infection, and the anti-spike protein antibody titer was evaluated. Results A total of 10,132 COVID-19 convalescent subjects were included, of whom 322 (3.3%) sustained reinfection within a one-year follow-up. In the first 8 months after recovery, the reinfected patients were characterized by a higher incidence of low 25(OH)D levels (<30 ng/mL, 92% vs. 84.8%, p < 0.05), while during the following three months, the incidence of low 25(OH)D levels was non-significantly higher among PCR-negative convalescent subjects compared to those reinfected (86% vs. 81.7, p = 0.15). By multivariate analysis, age > 44 years (OR-0.39, 95% CI: 0.173-0.87, p = 0.02) and anti-spike protein antibody titer > 50 AU/mL (0.49, 95% CI: 0.25-0.96, p = 0.04) were inversely related to reinfection. No consistent correlation with vitamin D levels was observed among the 3351 available anti-spike protein antibody titers of convalescent subjects. However, the median anti-spike protein antibody titers tended to increase over time in the vitamin D-deficient group. Conclusion Higher pre-infection 25(OH)D level correlated with protective COVID-19 immunity during the first 8 months following COVID-19 infection, which could not be explained by anti-spike protein antibody titers. This effect dissipated beyond this period, demonstrating a biphasic 25(OH)D association that warrants future studies.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-02-17", "cleaned_text": "Role of Vitamin D [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11020475](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11020475) [Antibody In this complex landscape, there is a growing debate regarding the efficacy and durability of immune memory in convalescent patients compared to that in fully vaccinated individuals. While most studies report non-inferiority of natural immunity relative to vaccine-induced immunity, recent reports have claimed the superiority of the former [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00475), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00475), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00475), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00475), [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00475), [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00475)]. However, the long-lasting protective effect of both types of immune induction is limited by the mutability of COVID-19, allowing evasion of the human immune system [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00475)]. [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00475)]. Immunomodulation by vitamin D might impact the pre-infection and the infection stages, as well as the post-infection and vaccination stages. In the pre-infectious and infectious stages, 25(OH)D deficiency correlated with increased infection rate and COVID-19-related complications including death [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00475), [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00475)]. Nevertheless, studies assessing the optimization of COVID-19 outcomes through vitamin D supplementation yielded equivocal results; vitamin D substitution reduced cough duration [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00475)], shortened hospital stay, and decreased mortality among patients with COVID-19 infection [ [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00475)]. In contrast, a single high dose of vitamin D3 administered to hospitalized patients with moderate-severe COVID-19 disease showed no effect [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00475)]. Reports from the acquired immunity stage have recently been provided [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00475)], showing a null effect of vitamin D supplementation on the protective efficacy or immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. 2. Methods and Patients [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00475)]. The Abbott assay was validated externally with excellent sensitivity and specificity [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00475)]. Qualitative results and index values reported by the system were used in the analyses. [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00475), [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00475), [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00475), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00475)]. For categorization of vitamin D levels, the common convention of most scientific societies was adopted, with values lower than 20 ng/mL representing vitamin D deficiency, concentrations of 21-29 ng/mL considered insufficient, and values > 30 ng/mL reflecting adequate levels. The study protocol was approved by the LHS Institutional Review Board (13-21-LEU). Statistical Analysis 3. Results [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-00475-f001), while their characteristics at inclusion are shown in [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00475-t001). Notably, the median interval that elapsed from the time of 25(OH)D measurement to the time of the first documented infection was 4 months (IQR: 1-7). As mentioned before, all of the trial's participants had an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 performed 3 months after recovery. Overall, the reinfection rate was 3.3% at a median follow-up of 8.6 months (6.2-11.3). In other words, 96.7% of the study population were RT-PCR negative at a median of 6.7 months (3.8-9.3). [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-00475-f002)illustrates the association between vitamin D levels and the PCR status (positive or negative) at different time intervals following recovery. During the first 8 months after recovery, the PCR-positive group, i.e., the reinfected subjects, were characterized by a higher incidence of low 25(OH)D (< 30 ng/mL) levels (95% vs. 84% months, and overall, 92% vs. 84.8% between 3-8 months after recovery, p < 0.05); however, during the 9-12 month period, the trend was reversed with a tendency toward a higher incidence of low 25(OH)D level among non-reinfected subjects (81.7% vs. 86%, p = 0.15). Of note, the number of subjects tested in each period clearly shows that the sample size of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing during the 9-12-month period was accounting for 29% (2990 participants) of the total tests performed ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-00475-f002)), sufficiently powered to reflect the population of interest. [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00475-t002). Up to months 7-8, lower vitamin D levels (<30 ng/mL) were associated with a higher infection rate. The overall infection rate during the first 8 months post-recovery was 3.34%, 2.54%, 1.53%, and 3.03% at vitamin D levels of <20, 20-30, > 30, and < 30 ng/mL, respectively. We then performed a statistical significance testing between the infection rate at the different vitamin D levels, showing significant differences between sufficient vitamin D levels (>30 ng/mL) and both low (<30 ng/mL) 0.07; vs. 3.03%, p = 0.002. Interestingly, during the 9-12-month interval after recovery, the correlation between the infection rate and vitamin D levels demonstrated an opposite trend, i.e., more infections documented with sufficient (>30 ng/mL) vitamin D levels: the infection rate correlated numerically; however, it did not correlate significantly with the brackets of vitamin D levels (p = NS). [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-00475-f003)). A linear regression model fitted to quantify the association between the elapsed time from recovery and the anti-spike antibody levels yielded the equation 676 + 66.7\u00d7 time (in months). The equation illustrates the overall stability of titers, with a non-significantly measured increase in total anti-spike antibody levels over time. Next, we evaluated the association between the median anti-spike antibody titers and the time elapsed from recovery stratified by baseline plasma 25(OH)D levels ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-11-00475-f004)). Deficient vitamin D levels (<20 ng/mL) during the 5-12-month interval after recovery were associated with non-significantly higher anti-spike antibody titers, while baseline vitamin D levels > 20 ng/mL were associated with steady antibody levels. No significant difference in median anti-spike antibody titers was observed between the different 25(OH)D levels at all time intervals. [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00475-t003). No single factor was a significant predictor of anti-spike antibody titer, including plasma 25(OH)D level itself. 4. Discussion [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00475), [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00475), [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00475), [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00475), [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00475)]. In this context, the ancillary role of 25(OH)D as an immune modulator has repeatedly been suggested. We used a data set involving 10,132 COVID-19 convalescent individuals from an integrated healthcare organization to evaluate a potential association between pre-infection 25(OH)D serum levels and both the anti-spike antibody titer, representing humoral immunity, and the reinfection rate. [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00475)]. A valuable finding of the current study is the relevance of 25(OH)D in the prevention of reinfection in the first 8 months post recovery. The recovered cohort virtually represents a homogeneous group of past RT-PCR-positive patients, a population already linked with lower vitamin D levels [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00475)]. Interestingly, despite being a vulnerable cohort with established lower 25(OH)D contents, the reinfected subjects in the current study still displayed lower 25(OH)D levels relative to the non-reinfected group, at least during the first 8 months after recovery. [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00475)] before the launch of COVID-19 vaccination, we found older age to be inversely correlated with reinfection in convalescent subjects. Older age was associated with higher adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, including social distancing [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00475)]. This behavior may explain the low infection rate in older subjects. Similarly, anti-spike protein antibody titer > 50 AU/mL was associated with a lower risk of infection. Most of the recovered group sustained minor symptoms during reinfection, explaining the restrained humoral response, with lower initial anti-spike antibody titers (months 3-4) associated with lower vitamin D levels (p = NS). Over time, the median antibody titers increased in the deficient vitamin D group, while a restrained increase was observed in subjects with higher 25(OH)D levels. In this context, several studies have reported an inverse relationship between serum 25(OH)D and virus antibody titers [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00475), [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00475), [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00475)]. Mechanistically, vitamin D has been shown to production of immunoglobulins [ [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00475), [33](#B33-vaccines-11-00475), [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00475), [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00475)], attenuating the humoral immune reaction induced by viruses. The continued positive antibody evolution in the long term may reflect the frequent occurrence (30-60%) of long-COVID-19 cases [ [36](#B36-vaccines-11-00475)], presumably due to small amounts of SARS-CoV-2 antigen or lack of complete viral clearance [ [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00475)]. [Figure 4](#vaccines-11-00475-f004)), we found inferior protection against reinfection with deficient vitamin D levels during this period. This observation indicates that a potential protective effect of vitamin D at this stage could not be mediated by immunoglobulins; nevertheless, the association between low vitamin D and reinfection seems to be reversed or absent during the 9-12-month period. As mentioned above, late convalescence was dominated by higher anti-spike protein antibody titer in the low vitamin D (0-20 ng/mL) subjects. The heightened humoral response at this stage might explain, at least partially, the mitigated reinfection risk. [Figure 5](#vaccines-11-00475-f005)). Of note, the sufficient 25(OH)D group showed the highest percentage of tests with anti-spike protein antibody titers < 50 AU/mL in the long term, once again demonstrating a potential hampering effect of vitamin D on antibody production. [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00475)], despite higher baseline vitamin D levels and substantially higher levels of measured anti-spike antibodies, and the surge in breakthrough infection was documented already at 5-6 months after vaccination. The above observations prove the complexity of the immunity puzzle. Vitamin D and anti-spike antibodies are simply just two measurable pieces of the puzzle. Nevertheless, we observed a substantial anti-spike antibody decay in the vaccinated cohort over time, as opposed to sustained levels in the naturally infected cohort. Acknowledging that anti-spike antibodies are not a direct measure of the immune neutralizing capacity, we surmise that the protective association of the maintained levels of anti-spike antibody titer in the convalescent cohort is a correlate of sustained, multi-faceted immunological response. The missing pieces of the puzzle within the complex framework of natural immunity are cellular immunity and other antibody types targeting multiple epitopes. In this regard, T cells seem to possess a pivotal role in SARS-CoV-2 protective immunity [ [38](#B38-vaccines-11-00475), [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00475)]. The advantage of targeting different immunogenic epitopes other than the spike protein during natural infection was reported before [ [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00475), [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00475)]; hence, targeting other immutable components of the viral structure, or multiple parts of the virus are emerging exciting avenues for vaccine optimization. 5. Study Limitations [42](#B42-vaccines-11-00475)]. Previous studies have shown progressive decay of neutralizing antibody levels over time, even with maintained levels of serologically measured anti-spike antibodies [ [43](#B43-vaccines-11-00475)]. Nevertheless, the substantial association in the current study between prior vitamin D deficiency and positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 suggests that most recovered individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were characterized by low 25(OH)D values when contracting COVID-19. However, this limitation is typical in very large patient studies, where minute individual details, occasionally important, are not available. The rationale behind these large-scale studies is that individual variations tend to mutually cancel each other due to the large number of patients. 6.
