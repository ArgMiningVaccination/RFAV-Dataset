By Cora Gold, Editor-in-Chief of [Revivalist](https://revivalist.com/) Skin care is a growing industry, as many people want to take better care of the skin to achieve a natural, glowy complexion. With increased demand comes increased production and marketing from the beauty industry. If you [have a spare $13,000](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-most-expensive-beauty-cream-in-the-world-is-selling-for-13000-2012-6) lying around, you could invest in the world's most expensive skin cream. However, you won't get much more than you could concoct yourself with the right ingredients, other than the crystal-layered packaging. Along with skyrocketing prices, the skin care [industry creates substantial waste](https://www.unsustainablemagazine.com/industrial-waste-management/). Between plastic packaging and toxic ingredients, buying the latest products isn't always good for you or the environment. However, you don't have to resign yourself to aging less gracefully or dealing with pimples. Here are 11 skin care home remedies to try before buying new products. 1. Castor Oil Castor oil has been used in many ways over the years as a natural remedy to various ailments. It has anti-inflammatory properties, and it can be used for joint pain, hair rejuvenation and digestive health. This ingredient also works wonders when applied topically. It has fabulous anti-aging benefits. Look for the Jamaican black variety, [which has a high pH level](https://www.ah18c.com/en-us/news/best-sustainable-hair-care-ingredients), helping to balance your skin's acidity-to-basic ratio. The color comes from the processing technique based on traditional preparation methods. 2. Honey Honey seems to have an endless amount of uses in skin care. This stuff is sticky, to be sure. However, it's also a potent antimicrobial that won't [dry your skin](https://www.unsustainablemagazine.com/eco-friendly-moisturizers-dry-skin/). What does that mean? It's great for folks with combination complexions who need to fight acne while keeping away flakes and ashiness. Honey is also the ideal skin care cream if you have an autoimmune disorder like eczema or psoriasis. It might even help with candida yeast infections. Before you think those pests only strike below the belt, take pause. Did you ever have what felt like a painful paper cut at the corners of your mouth? It might not have occurred from chapping. Angular cheilitis is the scientific term for this sometimes excruciating condition that makes salty and spicy foods a misery. It's caused by yeast. Applying a bit of honey as chapstick could fix the problem in no time - without the foul taste of many anti-fungal creams. To make this preparation less sticky, mix it with other creams. A carrier base like argan oil does the trick for oily types. 3. Aloe Aloe is another plant with phenomenal healing properties. If you keep a plant on your work desk, break off a leaf the next time you get a nasty paper cut. It will disinfect your wound and speed healing with its antimicrobial properties. Aloe also acts as a moisturizer without clogging pores. That's one reason you'll find it in scores of commercial-brand skin creams. However, there are [over 400 different species](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4488101/#:~:text=Aloe%20barbadensis%20Miller%20(%E8%98%86%E8%96%88%20l%C3%BA,climates%2C%20including%20the%20southern%20USA.) of this plant - so why not experiment with the real deal to see which works best for your skin? Adding a few extra houseplants to your house and office also benefits your health, thanks to their air-cleansing effects. 4. Argan Oil Beauticians might have thought the perfect carrier oil didn't exist until they met argan oil. What makes this stuff so magical? It's rich and emollient while remaining non-comedogenic - meaning it won't clog your pores, causing pimples. The antioxidants in argan oil provide sun protection, so reach for this staple if you can't swing a bottle of the commercial stuff. This oil also keeps your anti-acne products from excessively drying your skin, causing pore-clogging flakes. Finally, your face isn't the only place that benefits - new mamas can use it to soothe stretch marks from pregnancy. 5. Beer You might not like it when someone smells like a brewery. However, you don't have to imbibe to reap the benefits of beer for your skin. It might make cleaning up after your next party a beauty bonus. Beer helps balance your skin's pH levels and gently dissolves dead cells. Use it as an exfoliant for cleansing. Mixing it with a little lemon juice helps lighten brown spots - if you're not into the freckled look. 6. Borage Borage creates a natural barrier for your skin. Some eczema sufferers swear by it for easing the redness and soreness that accompanies their condition. Borage is rich in linolenic acid, a substance your body converts to prostaglandin. It helps reduce the inflammation associated with various skin and cardiovascular conditions. It has the highest concentration of this substance. It's also rich in omega-6 fatty acids, which your skin needs to maintain pliability. 7. Cocoa Butter Another popular ingredient in many commercial skin care products is cocoa butter. However, you can find the raw stuff in bulk for much less than many brand names. Cocoa butter is high in essential fatty acids, helping maintain your skin's elasticity. Because it comes from a plant, it's also rich in antioxidants that protect your skin from oxidative stress arising from the sun's rays, smoke, or pollution. 8. Almond Oil If you have extremely dry skin, almond oil might be your beauty go-to. It has been used for centuries in treating eczema and psoriasis while protecting against sun damage. What makes almond oil unique is how it adds positive oils to your skin while [stripping away the excess](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/almond-oil-for-face#safety) that can clog pores, causing acne. It also contains retinoids to accelerate skin turnover. Yes - almond oil may be the ideal anti-acne remedy for those over 40 who get wrinkly from over-the-counter treatments. Of course, the younger set can also try it as a replacement for pricey tretinoin treatments, a prescription retinoid. 9. Papaya The next time you need a DIY spa day, reach for papaya. Make a mask from this stuff - the papain it contains prompts your skin to secrete collagen, an essential nutrient for suppleness and glow. All you have to do is mash a bit of this fruit into a bowl and apply it to your face for 15 to 30 minutes. Use caution if you have a latex allergy - some people have a sensitivity. 10. Tamarind Seed You can soup up your DIY face cream even more by adding some tamarind seed to the blend. According to Ayurvedic medicine, the ground stuff can exfoliate while improving overall elasticity, hydration, and smoothness. You can order the seeds online or find them at natural health stores. 11. Coconut Oil Finally, coconut oil is a boon if you have extremely dry skin needing safeguarding from wind and sun. While it won't block many of the sun's rays, it provides some UV protection. However, the biggest benefits come from its creamy, fatty nature. It's solid at room temperature, so slather it on any non-acne-prone areas. If you're prone to breakouts, you might find this clogs your pores - so use caution.
