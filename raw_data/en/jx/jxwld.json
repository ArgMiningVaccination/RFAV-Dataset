Chiropractic is both a science and an art because it involves the delicate balance of restoring your body to its proper functioning in a natural and holistic way. If you are looking for pain relief without strong medications or invasive procedures, consider chiropractic care for a more safe and natural approach. Your [Cedar Park chiropractor](https://www.procaremedcenter.com/locations-and-contact/round-rock-chiropractor/) at ProCare Medical Centers has a team of chiropractors who utilize this restorative and healing approach to treating all kinds of illnesses and injuries. Here's what you need to know about the science behind chiropractic care. The Spine and the Nervous System Chiropractors are commonly associated with the spine because of how much their work focuses on the nervous system that is housed and protected inside the spinal column. The science behind chiropractic says that when the nervous system is functioning at its best then the rest of your body will too. The nervous system sends and receives messages throughout the body and when there is any kind of disruption to this flow it can lead to illness or injury. Chiropractors use specific, safe, and gentle techniques to address misalignments in your spine and joints that may prevent your nervous system from communicating effectively with the rest of your body. Misalignments in the spine are known as subluxations, and when any of your vertebrae are out of alignment it needs to be properly adjusted in order to remove any interference. Posture plays an important role in maintaining a safe and healthy space for your nervous system to function optimally. When you practice proper posture, your nervous system is able to send messages effectively through your body. If you have poor posture, it can lead to misalignments in the spine and extra pressure on certain areas, leading to dysfunction. Chiropractors Are Health Care Professionals Chiropractors are healthcare professionals who can address a wide variety of illnesses, injuries, and diseases. While perhaps most commonly known for treating back pain, chiropractors can address all kinds of pain and issues involving the nervous system as well as your musculoskeletal system. Chiropractors do not offer magical healing, but rather help promote your body's natural ability to heal itself. Your chiropractor will use state-of-the-art diagnostic imaging tools just like an orthopedist or neurologist would, including X-rays and CT scans. These tools provide your chiropractor with a clearer understanding of what is going on inside your body and to confirm a diagnosis before developing a treatment plan. Chiropractors address neuromuscular disorders with techniques unique to their profession and in which they have received significant training and experience. Chiropractic adjustments are the most common technique used to adjust your spine and resolve any misalignments that could be causing any number of health problems. These manual adjustments to the spine help relieve pain in both the short term and long term by addressing the root cause of the pain. When the spine is properly aligned, your chiropractor can also talk to you about holistically managing your health and partnering with you in exercise, nutrition, and general wellness for preventative care. Education and Training for Chiropractors Chiropractors go through advanced levels of schooling similar to [accident doctors](https://www.procaremedcenter.com/car-accident-doctors/), though students in chiropractic school will earn a Doctor of Chiropractic degree. Chiropractic school teaches chiropractors to be health care professionals through learning about how the nervous system controls and operates the entire rest of the body. The philosophy and the science behind chiropractic involve the relationship between the spine and the nervous system, and chiropractors study and practice ways to resolve misalignments and disruptions and restore proper functioning to the body.
