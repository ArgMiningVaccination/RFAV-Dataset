Nmeningitidis A, C, Y and W-135 strains are cultured on Mueller Hinton [agar](https://www.rxlist.com/agar/supplements.htm)3 and grown in [Watson](https://www.rxlist.com/watson/definition.htm) Scherp4 media. The polysaccharides are extracted from the N meningitidis cells and purified by centrifugation, detergent precipitation, alcohol precipitation, solvent extraction and diafiltration. To prepare the polysaccharides for conjugation, they are depolymerized, derivatized, and purified by diafiltration. Corynebacterium diphtheriae cultures are grown in a modified Mueller and Miller medium5 and detoxified with [formaldehyde](https://www.rxlist.com/formaldehyde/definition.htm). The diphtheria toxoid protein is purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and diafiltration. The derivatized polysaccharides are covalently linked to diphtheria toxoid and purified by serial diafiltration. The four meningococcal components, present as individual serogroup-specific glycoconjugates, compose the final formulated vaccine. No preservative or [adjuvant](https://www.rxlist.com/adjuvant/definition.htm) is added during manufacture. Each 0.5 mL dose may contain [residual](https://www.rxlist.com/residual/definition.htm) amounts of formaldehyde of less than 2.66 mcg (0.000532%), by calculation. Potency of Menactra vaccine is determined by quantifying the amount of each polysaccharide [antigen](https://www.rxlist.com/antigen/definition.htm) that is conjugated to diphtheria toxoid protein and the amount of unconjugated polysaccharide present. Menactra vaccine is manufactured as a sterile, clear to slightly turbid liquid. Each 0.5 mL dose of vaccine is formulated in sodium phosphate buffered isotonic sodium chloride solution to contain 4 mcg each of meningococcal A, C, Y and W-135 polysaccharides conjugated to approximately 48 mcg of diphtheria toxoid protein carrier. There is no latex in any component of the vial. REFERENCES 3 Mueller JH, et al.

Revised: Jul 2019 SIDE EFFECTS Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Children 9 Through 12 Months Of Age The safety of Menactra was evaluated in four clinical studies that enrolled 3721 participants who received Menactra at 9 and 12 months of age. At 12 months of age these children also received one or more other recommended [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm) [ [Measles](https://www.rxlist.com/measles/definition.htm), [Mumps](https://www.rxlist.com/mumps/definition.htm), Rubella and Rubella Virus Vaccine ( [MMR](https://www.rxlist.com/mmr/definition.htm)) and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live (V) each manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine (Diphtheria CRM197 Protein) manufactured by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc. (PCV7), [Hepatitis A](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatitis_a/definition.htm) Vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. (HepA). A control group of 997 children was enrolled at 12 months of age and received two or more [childhood](https://www.rxlist.com/childhood/definition.htm) vaccines [MMRV (or MMR+V), PCV7, HepA] at 12 months of age [see Concomitant Vaccine Administration]. Three percent of individuals received MMR and V, instead of MMRV, at 12 months of age. The primary safety study was a controlled trial that enrolled 1256 children who received Menactra at 9 and 12 months of age. At 12 months of age these children received MMRV (or MMR+V), PCV7 and HepA. A control group of 522 children received MMRV, PCV7 and HepA. Of the 1778 children, 78% of participants (Menactra, N=1056; control group, N=322) were enrolled at United States (US) sites and 22% at a Chilean site. (Menactra, N=200; control group, N=200). Individuals 2 Through 55 Years Of Age The safety of Menactra was evaluated in eight clinical studies that enrolled 10,057 participants aged 2-55 years who received Menactra and 5,266 participants who received Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135, Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine, Groups A, C, Y and W-135 Combined. There were no substantive differences in demographic characteristics between the vaccine groups. Among Menactra recipients 2-55 years of age 24.0%, the age groups, respectively. Among 2-55 years of age the 2-10, 11-14, 15-25 and 26-55-year age groups, respectively. The three primary safety studies were randomized, active-controlled trials that enrolled participants 2-10 N=1170), Of the of participants (Menactra, N=1164; Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135, (Menactra, N=549; Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135, N=488) of participants at a Chilean site. The median ages in the Chilean and US subpopulations were 5 and 6 years, respectively. All adolescents and adults were enrolled at US sites. As the route of administration differed for the two vaccines (Menactra given intramuscularly, Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 given subcutaneously), study personnel collecting the safety data differed from personnel administering the vaccine. Booster Vaccination Study In an [open-label trial](https://www.rxlist.com/open-label_trial/definition.htm) conducted in the US, 834 individuals were enrolled to receive a single dose of Menactra 4-6 years after a prior dose. The median age of participants was 17.1 years at the time of the booster dose. Safety Evaluation Participants were monitored after each [vaccination](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccination/definition.htm) for 20 or 30 minutes for immediate reactions, depending on the study. Solicited injection site and systemic reactions were recorded in a diary card for 7 consecutive days after each vaccination. Participants were monitored for 28 days (30 days for infants and toddlers) for unsolicited adverse events and for 6 months post-vaccination for visits to an emergency room, unexpected visits to an office physician, and serious adverse events. Unsolicited adverse event information was obtained either by telephone interview or at an interim clinic visit. Information regarding adverse events that occurred in the 6-month post-vaccination time period was obtained via a scripted telephone interview. Serious Adverse Events In All Safety Studies Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported during a 6-month time period following vaccinations in individuals 9 months through 55 years of age. In children who received Menactra at 9 months and at 12 months of age, SAEs occurred at a rate of 2.0% - 2.5%. In participants who received one or more childhood vaccine(s) (without co-administration of Menactra) at 12 months of age, SAEs occurred at a rate of 1.6% - 3.6%, depending on the number and type of vaccines received. In children 2-10 years of age, SAEs occurred at a rate of 0.6% following Menactra and at a rate of 0.7% following Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135. In adolescents 11 through 18 years of age and adults 18 years through 55 years of age, SAEs occurred at a rate of 1.0% following Menactra and at a rate of 1.3% following Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135. In adolescents and adults, SAEs occurred at a rate of 1.3% following booster vaccination with Menactra. Solicited Adverse Events In The Primary Safety Studies The most frequently reported solicited injection site and systemic adverse reactions within 7 days following vaccination in children 9 months and 12 months of age (Table 1) were injection site tenderness and irritability. The most frequently reported solicited injection site and systemic adverse reactions in US children aged 2-10 years of age (Table 2) were injection site pain and irritability. Diarrhea, drowsiness, and [anorexia](https://www.rxlist.com/anorexia/definition.htm) were also common. The most commonly reported solicited injection site and systemic adverse reactions in adolescents, ages 11-18 years (Table 3), and adults, ages 18-55 years (Table 4), after a single dose were injection site pain, headache and fatigue. Except for redness in adults, injection site reactions were more frequently reported after Menactra vaccination than after Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 vaccination.

Solicited Adverse Events In A Booster Vaccination Study For a description of the study design and number of participants, [see Clinical Trials Experience, Booster Vaccination Study]. The most common solicited injection site and systemic reactions within 7 days of vaccination were pain (60.2%) and myalgia (42.8%), respectively. Overall rates of solicited injection site reactions and solicited systemic reactions were similar to those observed in adolescents and adults after a single Menactra dose. The majority of solicited reactions were Grade 1 or 2 and resolved within 3 days. Adverse Events In Concomitant Vaccine Studies Solicited Injection Site And Systemic Reactions When Given With Routine Pediatric Vaccines For a description of the study design and number of participants, [see Clinical Trials Experience, Concomitant Vaccine Administration]. In the primary safety study, 1378 US children were enrolled to receive Menactra alone at 9 months of age and Menactra plus one or more other routinely administered vaccines (MMRV, PCV7 and HepA) at 12 months of age (N=961). Another group of children received two or more routinely administered vaccines (MMRV, PCV7 and HepA) (control group, n=321) at 12 months of age. The frequency of occurrence of solicited adverse events is presented in Table 1. Participants who received Menactra and the concomitant vaccines at 12 months of age described above reported similar frequencies of tenderness, redness and swelling at the Menactra injection site and at the concomitant vaccine injection sites. Tenderness was the most frequent injection site reaction (48%, 39%, 46% and 43% HepA sites, respectively). Irritability was the most frequent systemic reaction, reported in 62% of recipients of Menactra plus concomitant vaccines, and 65% of the control group [see Concomitant Vaccine Administration]. In a randomized, parallel group, US multi-center clinical trial conducted in children 4 through 6 years of age, Menactra was administered as follows: 30 days after concomitant DAPTACEL , Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis followed later by IPV [Group B]; concomitantly with IPV followed 30 days later by DAPTACEL [Group C]. Solicited injection site and systemic reactions were recorded in a diary card for 7 consecutive days after each vaccination. For all study groups, the most frequently reported solicited local reaction at the Menactra site was pain: 52.2%, 60.9% and 56.0% of participants in Groups A, B and C, respectively. For all study groups, the most frequently reported systemic reaction following the administration of Menactra alone or with the respective concomitant vaccines was myalgia: 24.2%, 37.3% and 26.7% of participants in Groups A, B and C, respectively. Fever >39.5\u00b0C occurred at <1.0% in all groups [see Concomitant Vaccine Administration]. Solicited Injection Site And Systemic Reactions When Given with Tetanus And Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed Vaccine In a clinical study, rates of local and systemic reactions after Menactra and Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed (Td) vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. were compared [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, and Concomitant Vaccine Administration for study description]. Injection site pain was reported more frequently after Td vaccination than after Menactra vaccination (71% versus 53%). The overall rate of systemic adverse events was higher when Menactra and Td vaccines were given concomitantly than when Menactra was administered 28 days after Td vaccine (59% versus 36%). In both groups, the most common reactions were headache (Menactra + Td vaccine, 36%; Td vaccine + Placebo, 34%; Menactra alone, 22%) and fatigue (Menactra + Td vaccine, 32%; Td vaccine + Placebo, 29%; Menactra alone, 17%). Fever 40.0\u00b0C occurred at 0.5% in all groups. Solicited Injection Site And Systemic Reactions When Given With Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine In a clinical study, rates of local and systemic reactions after Menactra and Typhim Vi [Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Sanofi Pasteur SA were compared [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and Concomitant Vaccine Administration] for a description of the concomitantly administered vaccine, study design and number of participants. More participants experienced pain after Typhoid vaccination than after Menactra vaccination (Typhoid + Placebo, 76% versus Menactra + Typhoid, 47%). The majority (70%-77%) of injection site solicited reactions for both groups at either injection site were reported as Grade 1 and resolved within 3 days post-vaccination. In both groups, the most common systemic reaction was headache (Menactra + Typhoid, 41%; Typhoid + Menactra alone, 27%). Fever 40.0\u00b0C and seizures were not reported in either group. Post-Marketing Experience In addition to reports in clinical trials, worldwide voluntary adverse events reports received since market introduction of Menactra are listed below. This list includes serious events and/or events which were included based on severity, frequency of reporting or a plausible causal connection to Menactra. Because these events were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccination. - Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Lymphadenopathy - Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis/anaphylactic reaction, wheezing, difficulty breathing, upper airway swelling, urticaria, erythema, Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia - General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: Large injection site reactions, extensive swelling of the injected limb (may be associated with erythema, warmth, tenderness or pain at the injection site). Post-marketing Safety Study The risk of GBS following receipt of Menactra was evaluated in a US retrospective cohort study using healthcare claims data from 9,578,688 individuals 11 through 18 years of age, of whom 1,431,906 (15%) received Menactra. Of 72 medical chart-confirmed GBS cases, none had received Menactra within 42 days prior to symptom onset. An additional 129 potential cases of GBS could not be confirmed or excluded due to absent or insufficient medical chart information. In an analysis that took into account the missing data, estimates of the attributable risk of GBS ranged from 0 to 5 additional cases of GBS per 1,000,000 vaccinees within the 6-week period following vaccination. DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant Administration With Other Vaccines Menactra vaccine was concomitantly administered with Typhim Vi [Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine] (Typhoid) and Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids Adsorbed, For Adult Use (Td) vaccine, in individuals 18 through 55 and 11 through 17 years of age, respectively. In children 4 through 6 years of age, Menactra was co-administered with DAPTACEL, and in children younger than 2 years of age, Menactra was co-administered with one or more of the following vaccines: PCV7, MMR, V, MMRV, or HepA ADVERSE REACTIONS]. When Menactra and DAPTACEL are to be administered to children 4 through 6 years of age, preference should be given to simultaneous administration of the 2 vaccines or administration of Menactra prior to DAPTACEL. Administration of Menactra one month after DAPTACEL has been shown to reduce meningococcal antibody responses to Menactra. Data are not available to evaluate the immune response to Menactra administered to younger children following DAPTACEL or to Menactra administered to persons <11 years of age following other diphtheria toxoidcontaining vaccines [see Clinical Studies]. Pneumococcal antibody responses to some serotypes in were decreased following co-administration of Menactra and PCV7 [see Concomitant Vaccine Administration]. Do not mix Menactra with other vaccines in the same syringe. When Menactra is administered concomitantly with other injectable vaccines, the vaccines should be administered with different syringes and given at separate injection sites. Immunosuppressive Therapies Immunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses) may reduce the immune response to vaccines. WARNINGS Included as part of the PRECAUTIONS section. PRECAUTIONS Guillain-Barre Syndrome Persons previously diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) may be at increased risk of GBS following receipt of Menactra. The decision to give Menactra should take into account the potential benefits and risks. GBS has been reported in temporal relationship following administration of Menactra (1) (2). The risk of GBS following Menactra vaccination was evaluated in a post-marketing retrospective cohort study [see Post-Marketing Experience]. Preventing And Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions Prior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the immunization history for possible vaccine sensitivity and previous vaccinationrelated adverse reactions to allow an assessment of benefits and risks. Epinephrine and other appropriate agents used for the control of immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available should an acute anaphylactic reaction occur. Altered Immunocompetence - Reduced Immune Response: Some individuals with altered immunocompetence, including some individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have reduced immune responses to Menactra. - Complement Deficiency: Persons with certain complement deficiencies and persons receiving treatment that inhibits terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at increased risk for invasive disease caused by N meningitidis, including invasive disease caused by serogroups A, C, Y and W- 135, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination with Menactra [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Limitations Of Vaccine Effectiveness Menactra may not protect all recipients. Syncope Syncope (fainting) has been reported following vaccination with Menactra. Procedures should be in place to prevent falling injury and manage syncopal reactions. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Menactra has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of male fertility. A developmental animal toxicity study showed that Menactra had no effects on female fertility in mice [see Pregnancy]. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Menactra during pregnancy. To enroll in or obtain information about the registry, call Sanofi Pasteur at 1-800-822-2463. Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of Menactra administration in pregnant women in the US. Available data suggest that rates of major birth defects and miscarriage in women who received Menactra 30 days prior to pregnancy or during pregnancy are consistent with estimated background rates. A developmental toxicity study was performed in female mice given 0.1 mL (in divided doses) of Menactra prior to mating and during gestation (a single human dose is 0.5 mL). The study revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to Menactra [see Animal Data]. Data Human Data A pregnancy registry spanning 11 years (2005-2016) included 222 reports of exposure to Menactra from 30 days before or at any time during pregnancy. Of these reports, 87 had known pregnancy outcomes available and were enrolled in the pregnancy registry prior to the outcomes being known. Outcomes among these prospectively followed pregnancies included 2 major birth defects and 6 miscarriages. Animal Data A developmental toxicity study was performed in female mice. The animals were administered 0.1 mL of Menactra (in divided doses) at each of the following time points: 14 days prior to mating, and on Days 6 and 18 of gestation (a single human dose is 0.5 mL). There were no vaccine-related fetal malformations or variations, and no adverse effects on pre-weaning development observed in the study. Lactation Risk Summary The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Menactra and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Menactra. Data are not available to assess the effects of Menactra on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. Pediatric Use Menactra is not approved for use in infants under 9 months of age. Available data show that infants administered three doses of Menactra (at 2, 4, and 6 months of age) had diminished responses to each meningococcal vaccine serogroup compared to older children given two doses at 9 and 12 months of age. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Menactra in adults older than 55 years of age have not been established. REFERENCES 1. CDC.

Risk of Guillain-Barre Syndrome Following Meningococcal Conjugate (MCV4) Vaccination. Final Study Report, Revised March 11, 2010. OVERDOSE No information provided. CONTRAINDICATIONS Severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of a meningococcal capsular polysaccharide-, diphtheria toxoid- or CRM197-containing vaccine, or component of Menactra vaccine [see [DESCRIPTION](/menactra-drug.htm#D)]. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism Of Action The presence of bactericidal anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies has been associated with protection from invasive meningococcal disease (6) (7). Menactra induces the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular polysaccharides of serogroups A, C, Y and W-135. Clinical Studies Efficacy The serum bactericidal assay (SBA) used to test sera contained an exogenous complement source that was either human (SBA-H) or baby rabbit (SBA-BR). (8) The response to vaccination following two doses of vaccine administered to children 9 and 12 months of age and following one dose of vaccine administered to children 2 through 10 years of age was evaluated by the proportion of participants having an SBA-H antibody titer of 1:8 or greater, for each serogroup. In individuals 11 through 55 years of age, the response to vaccination with a single dose of vaccine was evaluated by the proportion of participants with a 4-fold or greater increase in bactericidal antibody to each serogroup as measured by SBA-BR. For individuals 2 through 55 years of age, vaccine efficacy after a single dose was inferred from the demonstration of immunologic equivalence to a US-licensed meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine, Menomune \u00e2\u20ac\" A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine as assessed by SBA. Immunogenicity Children 9 Through 12 Months Of Age In a randomized, US, multi-center trial, children received Menactra at 9 months and 12 months of age. The first Menactra dose was administered alone, followed by a second Menactra dose given alone (N=404), or with MMRV (N=302), or with PCV7 (N=422). For all participants, sera were obtained approximately 30 days after last vaccination. There were no substantive differences in demographic characteristics between the vaccine groups. The median age range for administration of the first dose of Menactra was 278-279 days of age.

Prior to the first dose, 33.3% [n=16/48] of participants had an SBA-H and to Serogroups C, Y and W-135. After the second dose, percentages of participants with Through 55 Years Of Age Immunogenicity was evaluated in three comparative, randomized, US, multi-center, active controlled clinical trials that enrolled children (2 through 10 years of age), adolescents (11 through 18 years of age), and adults (18 through 55 years of age). Participants received a single dose of Menactra (N=2526) or Menomune \u00e2\u20ac\" A/C/Y/W-135 (N=2317). For all age groups studied, sera were obtained before and approximately 28 days after vaccination. [Blinding procedures for safety assessments are described in Adverse Reactions] In each of the trials, there were no substantive differences in demographic characteristics between the vaccine groups, between immunogenicity subsets or the overall study population. In the study of children 2 through 10 years of age, the median age of participants was 3 years; 95% completed the study. In the adolescent trial, the median age for both groups was 14 years; 99% completed the study. In the adult trial, the median age for both groups was 24 years; 94% completed the study. Immunogenicity In Children 2 Through 10 Years Of Age Of 1408 enrolled children 2 through 10 years of age, immune responses evaluated in a subset of Menactra participants (2 through 3 years of age, n=52; 4-10 years of age, n=84) and Menomune \u00e2\u20ac\" A/C/Y/W-135 participants (2 through 3 years of age, n=53; 4-10 years of age, n=84) were comparable for all four serogroups (Table 6).

The 95% CI for the Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) was calculated based on an approximation to the normal distribution. \u00a7The proportion of participants achieving an SBA-H titer of at least 1:8 was assessed using a 10% non-inferiority margin and a one-sided Type 1 error rate of 0.025. In the subset of participants 2 through 3 years of age with undetectable pre-vaccination titers (ie, SBA-H titers <1:4 at Day 0), seroconversion rates (defined as the proportions of participants with SBA-H titers 1:8 by Day 28) were similar between the and Menomune \u00e2\u20ac\" subset of participants through 10 years of age with undetectable pre-vaccination titers (ie, SBA-H titers <1:4 at Day 0), seroconversion rates (defined as the proportions of participants with SBA-H titers 1:8 by Day 28) were similar between the and Menomune \u00e2\u20ac\" Adolescents 11 Through 18 Years Of Age Results from the comparative clinical trial conducted in 881 adolescents aged 11 through 18 years showed that the immune responses to Menactra and Menomune \u00e2\u20ac\" A/C/Y/W-135 were similar for all four serogroups (Table participants with undetectable pre-vaccination titers (ie, SBA-BR titers <1:8 at Day 0), seroconversion rates (defined as the proportions of participants achieving a 4-fold rise in SBA-BR titers by Day 28) were similar between the Menactra and Menomune \u00e2\u20ac\" Adults 18 Through 55 Years Of Age Results from the comparative clinical trial conducted in 2554 adults aged 18 through 55 years showed that the immune responses to Menactra and Menomune \u00e2\u20ac\" A/C/Y/W-135 were similar for all four serogroups (Table 7). Table 7: Comparison of Bactericidal Antibody Responses* to Menactra and Menomune \u00e2\u20ac\" A/C/Y/W-135 28 Days after Vaccination for Participants 11 through 18 Years of Age and 18 through 55 Years of Age |Serogroup||Ages 11 through 18 Years||Ages 18 through | N=Number of subset participants with at least one valid serology result at Day 0 and Day 28. The 95% CI for the Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) was calculated based on an approximation to the distribution. \u00a7Menactra was non-inferior to Menomune \u00e2\u20ac\" A/C/Y/W-135. Non-inferiority was assessed by the proportion of participants with a 4-fold or greater rise in SBA-BR titer for N meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y and W-135 using a 10% non-inferiority margin and a one-sided Type I error rate of 0.05. In participants with undetectable pre-vaccination titers (ie, SBA-BR titers <1:8 at Day 0), seroconversion rates (defined as the proportions of participants achieving a 4-fold rise in SBA-BR titers by Day 28) were similar between the Menactra and Menomune \u00e2\u20ac\" Adolescents And Adults Following Booster Vaccination For a description of the study design and number of participants, [see Clinical Trials Experience, Booster Vaccination Study.] Prior to revaccination, the percentage of participants C, Y and W-135, respectively. Among the subset of trial participants (n=112) for whom SBA-H responses at Day 6 were assessed, 86.6%, 91.1%, 94.6%, and 92.0% achieved a 4-fold rise titer for Serogroups A, C, Y and W-135, respectively. The proportions of participants (n=781) who achieved a 4-fold rise in SBA-H titer by 28 were 95.0%, 95.3%, 97.1%, and 96% for Serogroups A, C, Y and W-135, respectively. The proportions of participants who achieved an SBA-H titer 1:8 by Day 28 were >99% for each serogroup. Concomitant Vaccine Administration MMRV (Or MMR + V) Or PCV7 In a US, active-controlled trial, 1179 children received Menactra at 9 months and 12 months of age. At 12 months of age these children received Menactra concomitantly with MMRV (N=616), or MMR + V (N=48), or PCV7 (N=250). old children received MMRV + PCV7 (N=485). Sera were obtained approximately 30 the last vaccinations. Measles, mumps, rubella and varicella antibody responses among children who received Menactra and MMRV (or MMR and V) were comparable to corresponding antibody responses among children who received MMRV and PCV7. When Menactra was given concomitantly with PCV7, the non-inferiority criteria for comparisons of pneumococcal IgG GMCs (upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the GMC ratio 2) were not met for 3 of 7 serotypes (4, 6B, 18C). In a opsonophagocytic assay GMT data were consistent with IgG GMC data. Td Vaccine In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, 1021 participants aged 11 through 17 years received Td vaccine and Menactra concomitantly (N=509), or Td vaccine followed one month later by Menactra (N=512). Sera were obtained approximately 28 days after each respective vaccination. The proportions of participants with a 4-fold or greater increase in SBA-BR titer to meningococcal Serogroups C, Y and W-135 were higher when Menactra was given concomitantly with Td vaccine (86%-96%) than when Menactra was given one month following Td vaccine (65%-91%). Antitetanus and anti-diphtheria antibody responses were similar in both study groups. Typhim Vi In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, 945 participants aged 18 through 55 years received Typhim Vi and Menactra concomitantly (N=469), or Typhim Vi followed one month later by Menactra (N=476). Sera were obtained approximately 28 days after each respective vaccination. The antibody responses to Menactra and to Typhim Vi components were similar in both study groups. DAPTACEL And IPV In a randomized, parallel group, US multi-center clinical trial conducted in children 4 through 6 years of age, Menactra was administered as follows: 30 days after later by IPV [Group B]; concomitantly with IPV followed 30 days later by DAPTACEL [Group C]. Sera were obtained approximately 30 days after each respective vaccination [see Clinical Trials Experience]. When Menactra was administered 30 days DAPTACEL (and IPV) [Group significantly lower SBA-H GMTs serogroups were observed compared to Menactra (and IPV) administered 30 days prior to DAPTACEL [Group after Menactra (and IPV) [Group C]. The non-inferiority criterion serogroup Y. Non-inferiority of SBA-H GMTs following concomitant administration of Menactra and DAPTACEL compared to those after concomitant Menactra and IPV was concluded if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of (GMTGroup C divided by GMTGroup B) computed separately for each of the serogroups was <2. The respective SBA-H GMTs and proportion (%) of Group A, B, and C study participants achieving an SBA-H titer of 1:8 are displayed in Table 8. Table 8: Bactericidal Antibody Responses* 30 Days Following Menactra Administered Alone or Concomitantly with DAPTACEL or IPV |Serogroup||Visit 1 Visit 2||Vaccines administered at Visit 1 and 30 days later at Visit 2| |Group A DAPTACEL source. | N=Total number of the subjects in the study population per group. 95% CIs for the proportions are calculated based on the Clopper-Pearson Exact method and normal approximation for that of the GMTs. \u00a7The proportion of participants achieving an SBA-H titer of at least 1:8, 30 days after Menactra. When Menactra was administered concomitantly with DAPTACEL, antibody responses to three of the [pertussis](https://www.rxlist.com/pertussis/definition.htm) antigens (pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, and pertactin) (GMCs), [tetanus](https://www.rxlist.com/tetanus/definition.htm) toxin (% participants with antibody concentrations 1.0 IU/mL), and diphtheria toxin (% participants with antibody concentrations 1.0 IU/mL) were non- [inferior](https://www.rxlist.com/inferior/definition.htm) to those observed after DAPTACEL and [IPV](https://www.rxlist.com/ipv/definition.htm). The pertussis anti-fimbriae GMCs were marginally lower when Menactra and DAPTACEL were administered concomitantly. REFERENCES 6. M\u00c3\u00a4kel\u00c3\u00a4 PH, et al.
