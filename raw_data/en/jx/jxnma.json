These reviews provide comprehensive, science-based information on common, costly medical conditions, and new health care technologies and strategies. Systematic reviews are the building blocks underlying evidence-based practice; they focus attention on the strength and limits of evidence from research studies about the effectiveness and safety of a clinical intervention. In the context of developing recommendations for practice, systematic reviews can help clarify whether assertions about the value of the intervention are based on strong evidence from clinical studies. For more information about AHRQ EPC systematic reviews, see www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reference/purpose.cfm. AHRQ expects that these systematic reviews will be helpful to health plans, providers, purchasers, government programs, and the health care system as a whole. Transparency and stakeholder input are essential to the Effective Health Care Program.

Low back pain is common, and many pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies are available. This review examines the evidence on the comparative benefits and harms of noninvasive treatments for low back pain. Data sources. A prior systematic review (searches through October 2008), electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE \u00ae and the Cochrane Libraries, January 2008 to April 2015), reference lists, and clinical trials registries. Review methods. Using predefined criteria, we selected systematic reviews of randomized trials of pharmacological treatments corticosteroids) and nonpharmacological treatments (psychological therapies, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, spinal manipulation, acupuncture, massage, exercise and related therapies, and various physical modalities) for nonradicular or radicular low back pain that addressed effectiveness or harms versus placebo, no treatment, usual care, a sham therapy, an inactive therapy, or another active therapy. We also included randomized trials that were not in systematic reviews. The quality of included studies was assessed, data were extracted, and results were summarized qualitatively based on the totality of the evidence. Results. Of the 2,545 citations identified at the title and abstract level, a total of 156 publications were included. Most trials enrolled patients with pain symptoms of at least moderate intensity (e.g., >5 on a 0- to 10-point numeric rating scale for pain). Across interventions, pain intensity was the most commonly reported outcome, followed by back-specific function. When present, observed benefits for pain were generally in the small (5 to 10 points on a 0- to 100-point visual analog scale or 0.5 to 1.0 points on a 0- to 10-point numeric rating scale) to moderate (10 to 20 points) range. Effects on function were generally smaller than effects on pain; in some cases, there were positive effects on pain but no effects on function, and fewer studies measured function than pain. Benefits were mostly measured at short-term followup. For acute low back pain, evidence suggested that NSAIDs (strength of evidence [SOE]: low to moderate), skeletal muscle relaxants (SOE: moderate), opioids (SOE: low), exercise (SOE: low), and superficial heat (SOE: moderate) are more effective than placebo, no intervention, or usual care, and that acetaminophen (SOE: low) and systemic corticosteroids (SOE: low) are no more effective than placebo. For chronic low back pain, effective therapies versus placebo, sham, no treatment, usual care, or wait list are NSAIDs, opioids, tramadol, duloxetine, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, and exercise (SOE: moderate) and benzodiazepines, psychological therapies, massage, yoga, tai chi, and low-level laser therapy (SOE: low); spinal manipulation was as effective as other active interventions (SOE: moderate). Few trials evaluated the effectiveness of treatments for radicular low back pain, but the available evidence found that benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, traction, and spinal manipulation were not effective or were associated with small effects (SOE: low). Relatively few trials directly compared the effectiveness of different medications or different nonpharmacological therapies, or compared pharmacological versus nonpharmacological therapies, and they generally found no clear differences in effects. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.viiiPharmacological therapies were associated with increased risk of adverse events versus placebo (SOE: low to moderate). Trials were not designed or powered to detect serious harms from pharmacological therapies. Although rates appeared to be low and there was not an increased risk of serious harms versus placebo, this does not rule out significant risk from some treatments. For nonpharmacological therapies, assessment of harms was suboptimal, but serious harms appeared to be rare (SOE: low). Conclusions. A number of pharmacological and nonpharmacological noninvasive treatments for low back pain are associated with small to moderate, primarily short-term effects on pain versus placebo, sham, wait list, or no treatment. Effects on function were generally smaller than effects on pain. More research is needed to understand optimal selection of treatments, effective combinations and sequencing of treatments, effectiveness of treatments for radicular low back pain, and effectiveness on outcomes other than pain and function.

Up to 84 percent of adults have low back pain at some time in their lives, and over one-quarter of U.S. adults report recent (in the last 3 months) low back pain.1,2 Low back pain can have major adverse impacts on quality of life and function. Low back pain is also costly: total U.S. health care expenditures for low back pain in 1998 were estimated at $90 billion. 3 Since that time, costs of low back pain care have risen at a rate higher than observed for overall health expenditures.4 In addition to high direct costs, low back pain is one of the most common reasons for missed work or reduced productivity while at work, resulting in high indirect costs. 5 The prognosis for acute low back pain (generally defined as an episode lasting less than 4 weeks) is generally favorable. Most patients experience a rapid improvement in (and often a complete resolution of) pain and disability, and are able to return to work. 6 In those with persistent symptoms, continued improvement is often seen in the subacute phase between 4 and 12 weeks, although at a slower rate than observed at first. In a minority of patients, low back pain lasts longer than 12 weeks, at which point it is considered chronic; levels of pain and disability often remain relatively constant thereafter. 7 Recently, a National Institutes of Health Research Task Force defined chronic low back pain as a back pain problem that has persisted at least 3 months and has resulted in pain on at least half the days in the past 6 months. 8 Patients with chronic back pain account for the bulk of the burdens and costs of low back pain.9,10 Predictors of chronicity are primarily related to psychosocial factors, such as presence of psychological comorbidities, maladaptive coping strategies (e.g., fear avoidance [avoiding activities because of fears that they will further damage the back] or catastrophizing [anticipating the worst possible outcomes from low back pain]), presence of nonorganic signs (symptoms without a distinct anatomical or physiological basis), 11 high baseline functional impairment, and low general health status.7 Back pain is frequently associated with presence of depression and anxiety. Attributing symptoms of low back pain to a specific disease or spinal pathology is a challenge.12 Spinal imaging abnormalities, such as degenerative disc disease, facet joint arthropathy, and bulging or herniated intervertebral discs, are extremely common in patients with or without low back pain, particularly in older adults, and such findings are poor predictors for the presence or severity of low back pain. 13 Radiculopathy from nerve root impingement (often due to a herniated intervertebral disc) and radiculopathy from spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) are each present in about 4 to 5 percent of patients with low back pain and can cause neurological symptoms, such as lower extremity pain, paresthesias, and weakness; the natural history and response to treatment for these conditions may differ from back pain without neurologic involvement. 14 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.ES-2Interventions for Low Back Pain Multiple treatment options for acute and chronic low back pain are available. Broadly, these can be classified as pharmacological treatments,15 noninvasive nonpharmacological treatments,16 injection therapies,17 and surgical treatments.18 This report focuses on the comparative benefits and harms of pharmacological and noninvasive nonpharmacological treatments; each of these categories encompasses a number of different therapies. Pharmacological treatments corticosteroids; nonpharmacological treatments include exercise and related interventions (e.g., yoga), complementary and alternative therapies (e.g., spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and massage), psychological therapies (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation), and physical modalities (e.g., traction, ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS], low-level laser therapy, interferential therapy, superficial heat or cold, back supports, and magnets). Scope of Review and Key Questions The provisional Key Questions; populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, settings, and study designs (PICOTS); and analytic framework for this topic (Figure A) were posted on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Web site for public comment from December 17, 2013, through January 17, 2014. Key Question 1. What are the comparative benefits and harms of dif ferent pharmacological therapies for acute or chronic nonradicular low back pain, radicular low back pain, or spinal and topical/patch-delivered medications. Key Question 2. What are the comparative benefits and harms of different nonpharmacological noninvasive therapies for acute or chronic nonradicular low back pain, radicular low back pain, or spinal stenosis? Includes but is not limited to multidisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise (various types), physical modalities (ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, electrical muscle stimulation, interferential therapy , heat [various forms], and ice), traction tables/devices, back supports/bracing, spinal manipulation, various psychological therapies, acupuncture, massage therapy (various types), yoga, magnets, and low-level lasers.

Methods This Comparative Effectiveness Review follows the methods suggested in the AHRQ \"Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews\" (hereafter, \"AHRQ Methods Guide\").19 Our methods are summarized in this section; for additional details, see the review protocol posted on the AHRQ Effective Health Care Program Web site (www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov). Literature Search and Selection A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through August 2014. We restricted search start dates to January 2008 because searches in a prior American Pain Society/American College of Physicians (APS/ACP) review were conducted through October 2008; the APS/ACP review was used to identify studies published prior to 2008. 20 For interventions not addressed in the APS/ACP review, we searched the same databases without a search date start restriction. We also hand searched the reference lists of relevant studies and searched for unpublished studies in ClinicalTrials.gov. Scientific information packets were solicited from drug and device manufacturers, and a notice published in the Federal Register invited interested parties to submit relevant published and unpublished studies. We conducted an update search in April 2015 using the same search strategy as in the original search. We developed criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies based on the Key Questions and PICOTS. Abstracts were reviewed by two investigators, and all citations deemed potentially Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.ES-4appropriate for inclusion by at least one of the reviewers were retrieved. Two investigators then independently reviewed all full-text articles for final inclusion. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus. Population and condition of interest. This report focuses on adults with low back pain of any duration (categorized as acute [<4 weeks], subacute [4-12 weeks], low back pain, radicular low back pain (e.g., due to herniated disc), and symptomatic spinal stenosis. Interventions, comparisons, and study designs of interest. We included pharmacological and noninvasive nonpharmacological therapies for low back pain. For opioids, we excluded the drug propoxyphene, a weak analgesic associated with risk of cardiac arrhythmia that is no longer available in the United States or Europe. For skeletal muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines, we included drugs not available in the United States but available in Europe and noted such instances. Comparisons were of an included therapy versus placebo (drug trials), sham treatments (nonpharmacological intervention), no treatment, wait list, or usual care, as well as comparisons of one included therapy versus another. We also evaluated comparisons of the combination of one included therapy plus another included therapy versus one of the therapies alone. Outcomes of interest. We evaluated effects of interventions on reduction or elimination of low back pain, including related leg symptoms, improvement in back-specific and overall function, improvement in health-related quality of life, reduction in work disability/return to work, global improvement, number of back pain episodes or time between episodes, and patient satisfaction. We also evaluated adverse effects, including serious adverse events (e.g., anaphylaxis with medications, neurological complications, death) and less serious adverse events. Timing and settings of interest. When possible, timing of outcomes was stratified as long term (at least 1 year) and short term (up to 6 months); we also noted outcomes assessed immediately after the completion of a course of treatment. We included studies conducted in inpatient or outpatient settings. Study designs. Given the large number of interventions and comparisons addressed in this review, we included systematic reviews of randomized trials. 21,22 For each intervention, we selected the systematic review that was the most relevant to our Key Questions and scope (as defined in the PICOTS), had the most recent search dates, and was of highest quality based on assessments using the AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) tool. 23 We supplemented systematic reviews with randomized trials that were not included in the reviews. For harms, we included cohort studies for interventions and comparisons when randomized trials were sparse or unavailable. We did not include systematic reviews identified in the update searches but checked reference lists for additional randomized trials. We excluded case-control studies, case reports, and case series. Data Extraction For systematic reviews we abstracted the following data: inclusion criteria, search strategy, databases searched, search dates, the number of included studies, study characteristics of included studies (e.g., sample sizes, interventions, duration of treatment, duration of followup, Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.ES-5comparison, and results), methods of quality assessment, quality ratings for included studies, methods for synthesis, and results. For primary studies not included in systematic reviews, we abstracted the following data: study design, year, setting, country, sample size, eligibility criteria, population and clinical characteristics, intervention characteristics, and results. Information relevant for assessing applicability was also abstracted, including the characteristics of the population, interventions, and care settings; the use of run-in or washout periods; and the number of patients enrolled relative to the number assessed for eligibility. All study data were verified for accuracy and completeness by a second team member. Risk-of-Bias Assessment of Individual Studies Two investigators independently assessed quality (risk of bias) of systematic reviews and primary studies not included in systematic reviews using predefined criteria, with disagreements resolved by consensus. Randomized trials were evaluated using criteria and methods developed by the Cochrane Back Review Group, 24 and cohort studies were evaluated using criteria developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.25 Systematic reviews were assessed using the AMSTAR quality rating instrument.22 These criteria and methods were used in conjunction with the approach recommended in the AHRQ Methods Guide.21 Studies were rated as good, fair, or poor. We re-reviewed the quality ratings of studies included in the prior APS/ACP review to ensure consistency in quality assessment. 23 For primary studies included in systematic reviews, we relied on the quality ratings or risk-of- bias assessments performed in the systematic reviews as long as they used a standardized method for assessing quality (e.g., Cochrane Back Review Group, Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, PEDro [Physiotherapy Evidence Database] tool). If we were uncertain about the methods used to assess risk of bias or quality, we assessed the quality of individual studies ourselves, using the methods described previously. We did not exclude studies rated poor quality a priori, but they were considered the least reliable when synthesizing the evidence, particularly when discrepancies among studies were present. Data Synthesis We synthesized data qualitatively, based on the totality of evidence (i.e., evidence included in the prior APS/ACP review plus new evidence). We synthesized results for continuous as well as dichotomous outcomes. We reported binary outcomes based on the proportion of patients achieving successful pain reduction, improvement in function, or some composite overall measure of success as defined in the trials, which varied in how they categorized successful outcomes. In addition, we reported meta-analysis from systematic reviews that reported pooled estimates from studies that were judged to be homogeneous enough to provide a meaningful combined estimate and used appropriate pooling methods (e.g., random-effects model in the presence of statistical heterogeneity). When statistical heterogeneity was present, we examined the type of inconsistency present and evaluated subgroup and sensitivity analyses based on Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.ES-6study characteristics, intervention factors, and patient factors. We did not conduct updated meta- analysis with new studies. Rather, we qualitatively examined whether results of new studies were consistent with pooled or qualitative findings from prior systematic reviews. When we included more than one systematic review for a particular intervention and comparison, we evaluated the consistency of results among reviews. We assessed the strength of evidence (i.e., evidence in prior reviews as well as new evidence) for each Key Question and outcome using the approach described in the AHRQ Methods Guide19 based on the overall quality of each body of evidence. Results Database searches resulted in 2,545 potentially relevant articles. After dual review of abstracts and titles, 1,310 articles were selected for full-text dual review; 156 publications were determined to meet inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Most trials were conducted in patients with nonradicular low back pain or mixed populations with primarily nonradicular low back pain. Some trials enrolled mixed populations of patients with acute and subacute symptoms, with few trials restricted to patients with subacute low back pain. Therefore, acute and subacute low back pain were grouped together when summarizing findings. Pain was the most commonly reported outcome in the trials, followed by function, with evidence on other efficacy outcomes generally too limited to reach reliable conclusions. In addition, most trials focused on short-term outcomes, frequently with followup limited to the active treatment period. Assessment and reporting of harms were suboptimal, particularly for the nonpharmacological therapies. Summarizing evidence on nonpharmacological therapies was also complicated by variability in the techniques used; in the number, length, and intensity of sessions; and in the duration of treatment. Common methodological shortcomings included failure to report randomization or allocation concealment methods, unblinded or unclearly blinded design, and high or unclear attrition. Key Question 1. Pharmacological Therapies For acute or subacute low back pain, NSAIDs, opioids (buprenorphine patch), and skeletal muscle relaxants were associated with small effects on pain versus placebo, and NSAIDs were associated with small effects on function (Table A). Acetaminophen and systemic corticosteroids were associated with no beneficial effects versus placebo. Head-to-head comparisons were limited but indicated no clear differences between acetaminophen versus NSAIDs or between different NSAIDs (Table B). For chronic low back pain, NSAIDs and tramadol were associated with moderate effects on pain versus placebo, and opioids, duloxetine, and benzodiazepines were associated with small effects (Table C). Effects on function were small for NSAIDs, opioids, tramadol, and duloxetine. Tricyclic antidepressants were not associated with beneficial effects, and there was insufficient evidence to determine effects of gabapentin or pregabalin. Head-to-head comparisons were limited but showed no clear differences between different NSAIDs, different long-acting opioids, or long-acting versus short-acting opioids. Evidence was too inconsistent to determine effects of opioids versus NSAIDs (Table D). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.ES-7Evidence on effects of pharmacological therapies for radiculopathy was extremely limited (Table E). There were no differences in pain or function between systemic corticosteroids versus placebo, and evidence was insufficient to determine effects of gabapentin or pregabalin. Pharmacological therapies were associated with an increased risk of adverse events versus placebo. However, serious harms were rare in clinical trials, with no clear increase in risk based on clinical trials. In particular, trials of opioids were not designed to assess for serious harms, such as overdose, abuse, and addiction. Such harms have been reported in observational studies of opioids for chronic pain, although such studies did not meet inclusion criteria because they were not restricted to patients with low back pain. 26 Key Question 2. Nonpharmacological Noninvasive Therapies Evidence on the effectiveness of nonpharmacological therapies for acute low back pain was limited. There was limited evidence that spinal manipulation, heat, massage, and low-level laser therapy are associated with some beneficial effects versus a sham therapy, no intervention, or usual care (Table F). Effects on pain or function were moderate for exercise, massage, and heat, and otherwise small. For chronic low back pain, a number of nonpharmacological therapies appear to be effective for improving pain or function (Table G). These include exercise, yoga, and tai chi; various psychological therapies; multidisciplinary rehabilitation; acupuncture; spinal manipulation (vs. an inert treatment); and low-level laser therapy. Effects were small to moderate in magnitude. Other physical modalities were not associated with beneficial effects, or evidence was insufficient to estimate effects. Based on head-to-head comparisons, multidisciplinary rehabilitation was associated with small to moderate beneficial effects on pain and function versus standard physical therapy, and spinal manipulation and massage were associated with small beneficial effects versus other active interventions (Table H). There was no strong evidence of differences in effectiveness among different exercise, massage, spinal manipulation, or acupuncture techniques, or among different types of psychological therapies. Assessment and reporting of harms for nonpharmacological therapies were suboptimal but indicated no serious harms. Reported harms were generally related to superficial symptoms at the application site or a temporary increase in pain. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old.

Gabapentin vs. placebo, chronic radicular LBP: Pain and functionInsufficient There was insufficient evidence from 3 poor-quality trials with inconsistent findings to determine effects of gabapentin vs. placebo. Topiramate vs. placebo, chronic radicular or mixed radicular and nonradicular LBP: PainInsufficient Two trials reported inconsistent results for effects of topiramate vs. placebo. Pregabalin vs. placebo, chronic radicular LBP: Pain and functionInsufficient Two trials reported inconsistent effects of pregabalin vs. placebo for pain or function. Pregabalin vs. amitriptyline: PainInsufficient There was insufficient evidence from 1 poor-quality trial to determine effects of pregabalin vs. One trial found the addition of pregabalin 300 mg/day to transdermal buprenorphine was associated with substantially lower pain scores than transdermal buprenorphine alone at 3 weeks (difference, ~26 points on a 0 to 100 scale; p <0.05), but the estimate was very imprecise Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old.

Because of the large number of interventions addressed in this review, we used relevant well-conducted systematic reviews when available. All conclusions are based on the totality of evidence (i.e., studies included in systematic reviews plus additional primary studies). Across interventions, pain intensity was the most commonly reported outcome, followed by back-specific function, typically measured using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) or the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). When present, observed benefits were generally small (5 to 10 points on a 100-point visual analog scale or equivalent, or standardized mean difference [SMD] of 0.2 to 0.5) to moderate (10 to 20 points, or SMD of 0.5 to 0.8) for pain. Effects on function were typically smaller than effects on pain or were unclear; other outcomes (such as quality of life, mood, work, analgesic use, or use of resources) were generally reported inconsistently, and data were too sparse to reach reliable conclusions. New evidence affected conclusions for several classes of medications. The prior review concluded that acetaminophen was effective for acute low back pain, primarily based on indirect evidence from trials of acetaminophen for other conditions and trials of acetaminophen versus other analgesics. However, a recent well-conducted trial\u2014the first placebo-controlled trial in patients with acute low back pain\u2014found acetaminophen to be no more effective than placebo (strength of evidence [SOE]: low). 27 For antidepressant drugs, no studies in the prior review evaluated drugs in the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor class. Evidence from several trials indicates that duloxetine is more effective than placebo for pain and function in patients with chronic low back pain (SOE: moderate). 28-30 However, effects were small (less than 1 point on a 0 to 10 scale), and all trials were funded by the manufacturer of duloxetine and led by the same researcher. For antiseizure medications, new evidence is available on pregabalin for radicular low back pain, but the studies had methodological shortcomings and were too inconsistent to reliably estimate effects (SOE: insufficient). 31,32 The prior review found no studies on the effects of benzodiazepines for radiculopathy. One recent trial found that benzodiazepines were no more effective than placebo for this condition (SOE: low). 33 The trial also found that for some outcomes, such as return to work, benzodiazepines were associated with worse outcomes than placebo. Main conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of pharmacological therapies for low back pain were otherwise relatively unchanged from the prior review and are summarized in Tables A-E. One area in which conclusions changed was the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants. In our prior review, tricyclic antidepressants were found to be associated with small beneficial effects for chronic low back pain. However, evidence reviewed for this report suggests that tricyclic antidepressants are not effective versus placebo (4 a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is not associated with the anticholinergic and cardiac side effects of tricyclics, is now available as a potential alternative antidepressant. Evidence on the effectiveness of opioids for low back pain remains limited to short-term trials showing modest effects versus placebo on short-term pain and function 35 (SOE: moderate). Findings regarding the increased risk of opioids versus placebo for harms such as constipation, nausea, sedation, and dry mouth are also unchanged. Trials of opioids for low back pain were not designed to assess risk of serious adverse events, such as overdose, abuse or addiction, or Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.ES-37accidental injuries, because of their relatively small samples and short duration of followup. In addition, trials of opioids typically excluded patients with risk factors for overdose, abuse, or addiction. However, observational studies of opioids for chronic pain in general (not restricted to low back pain) have shown an association with serious harms that appears to be dose dependent. 36 Serious harms were generally not observed in trials of nonopioid medications, although harms were generally not reported well. Like trials of opioids, trials of nonopioid medications were not designed to assess risk of serious uncommon harms (e.g., liver toxicity with acetaminophen, bleeding with NSAIDs, fracture or infection with corticosteroids, or abuse or addiction with benzodiazepines). The current report reviews several nonpharmacological therapies not addressed in the prior APS/ACP review. Evidence on taping (using techniques to increase skin tension) did not clearly show beneficial effects versus sham taping comparisons, although findings were limited by methodological shortcomings and inconsistency (SOE: insufficient to low). There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of electrical muscle stimulation because of methodological shortcomings in the trials and imprecision (SOE: insufficient). Two trials found that tai chi was more effective than wait-list control for pain intensity and function 37 (SOE: low); effects appeared to be similar to those observed for other types of exercise and related interventions. As in the APS/ACP review, we found little evidence to support the use of most passive physical modalities for low back pain. An exception was superficial heat, which was found to be more effective than a nonheated control for acute or subacute low back pain (SOE: moderate). Although evidence on effectiveness of ultrasound and TENS was previously classified as insufficient, additional evidence now supports the findings that ultrasound is not effective versus sham ultrasound 38 and that TENS is not effective versus sham TENS,39 although the strength of evidence remains low because of methodological limitations in the trials and imprecision. Based on three trials, 40-42 low-level laser therapy was more effective than sham laser for pain, although methods for assessing pain and duration of followup varied; there was insufficient evidence from one trial to determine effects on function. Evidence to compare effects of one physical modality versus another, or a physical modality versus another active intervention, was generally too limited to reach reliable conclusions. Harms were not well reported in trials of nonpharmacological therapies, although serious adverse events appear to be rare. For physical modalities, harms, when reported, were mostly related to superficial effects at the application site. Severe neurological complications were not reported in trials of lumbar spinal manipulation, and serious infections, bleeding, or other complications were not reported in trials of acupuncture. Findings in Relationship to What Is Already Known Our findings are generally consistent with those of prior systematic reviews on noninvasive treatments for low back pain, in part because our report builds on a prior review and utilizes previously published high-quality systematic reviews to inform its findings. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.ES-38Our prior report and other previous systematic reviews43,44 found that tricyclic antidepressants were associated with small beneficial effects for low back pain. However, the evidence reviewed for this report suggests that they are not effective versus placebo for pain relief (4 trials; SMD, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.31; I2 = 32%) or function. 34 One potential reason for the discrepancy between this finding and prior reviews is that some of the prior reviews did not conduct a meta-analysis. 44,45 A review43 that conducted meta-analysis included a study that did not report being randomized and reported the largest effect in favor of antidepressants,46 did not include relevant studies that were in the more current review,47-49 and included two relevant studies in the meta- analysis for which data had to be imputed,50,51 but did not report methods for imputation. For nonpharmacological treatments, our findings are also generally consistent with other systematic reviews. Like other reviews, we found some evidence to support use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies, such as acupuncture, spinal manipulation, and massage. 52-56 Although acupuncture was no more effective than sham acupuncture in some trials, other reviews found that the overall evidence (including pooled estimates) suggests beneficial effects on pain. 57,58 Findings regarding the effectiveness of exercise are similar to our prior review and other reviews.59-61 Our findings are also consistent with reviews that focused on more specific types of exercise, such as aquatic exercise,62 sling exercise,63 walking, stability exercises,64,65 or modifying patterns of movement.66 Our findings that psychological therapies and multidisciplinary rehabilitation are both effective are consistent with our prior review and other reviews. 67 Other reviews that focused on related interventions, such as functional restoration or cognitive-behaviorally based physical therapy (in which the literature overlaps with that on multidisciplinary rehabilitation), have also reached positive conclusions. 68-70 As in our prior review, we found that for most physical modalities, evidence was too weak to determine effectiveness. As in other reviews, we found that evidence on the effectiveness of therapies for radicular low back pain was quite limited. 71,72 As in other reviews, including our prior report, we found that systemic corticosteroids are not effective for radicular low back pain.72, 73 Applicability A number of issues could impact the applicability of our findings. Some studies did not specifically enroll patients with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain, but rather enrolled mixed populations or did not clearly describe the duration of symptoms. Relatively few studies enrolled patients specifically with radicular symptoms, and many studies did not specifically describe whether patients with radicular symptoms were excluded. Of studies of patients with nonradicular symptoms, most did not attempt to evaluate whether effectiveness varied in subgroups of patients defined by clinical, demographic, imaging, or other characteristics. For nonpharmacological treatments, the applicability of our findings is affected by the variability among trials in the interventions and comparators evaluated. In trials that evaluated \"usual care\" comparators, the components of usual care were often not well described or standardized, making it difficult to apply findings to clinical practice. Other factors that could impact the applicability of our findings regarding nonpharmacological interventions include Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.ES-39differences related to the setting in which the intervention was performed (e.g., United States vs. another country, specialist vs. primary care setting) or to the training or skill of the person performing the intervention. To help interpret the results of the trials, we categorized the magnitude of effects for pain and function using the system in the APS/ACP review. Based on these categories, beneficial effects, when present, were in the small or moderate range. However, effects that we classified as small (e.g., 5-10 points on a 0 to 100 scale for pain or function) are below some proposed thresholds for minimum clinically important differences (e.g., 15 points on a 0 to 100 visual analog scale for pain, 2 points on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale for pain or function, 5 points on the RDQ, and 10 points on the ODI, or a 30% change from baseline). 74 Nonetheless, our classification system provides some objective benchmarks for assessing magnitude of effects, including the smaller effects typically observed in low back pain trials. We also evaluated the proportion of patients who experienced a clinically important improvement in pain or function (e.g., 50% improvement in pain or on the RDQ). However, many studies did not report such dichotomous outcomes, and among those that did, definitions for clinically important improvements varied. When present, most beneficial effects were observed at shorter term followup; effects were typically attenuated or no longer present at long term followup. Implications for Clinical and Policy Decisionmaking Our findings have implications for clinical and policy decisionmaking. Clinical practice guidelines recommend acetaminophen as a first-line pharmacological therapy for acute and chronic low back pain. 14,75 New evidence27 that acetaminophen is ineffective for acute low back pain calls into question its appropriateness as a recommended therapy, although other factors, such as low cost, favorable side-effect profile, and effectiveness for other acute pain conditions, could also impact decisions regarding its use. 76 Although tricyclic antidepressants have long been recommended as a secondary treatment option for chronic low back pain, duloxetine has specifically been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this condition and appears to be more effective than tricyclic antidepressants, as well as being associated with a more favorable safety profile, which could impact the selection of drugs within the antidepressant class. The use of opioids for chronic pain has become an area of increasing concern because of uncertain long-term effectiveness and marked increases in the number of accidental overdoses, as well as other harms related to their abuse potential. 36 Patients with low back pain are frequently prescribed opioids and account for a high proportion of the patients prescribed opioids. Decisions regarding the appropriate use of opioids for low back pain must weigh short-term, relatively modest benefits against potential harms. Guidelines recommend risk assessment, careful patient selection, and close monitoring and followup in patients prescribed opioids. 77 The continued paucity of evidence to determine effective treatments for radicular low back pain necessitates that most decisions are based on extrapolation of evidence on the effectiveness of treatments for nonradicular low back pain or other non-back-related neuropathic pain conditions. This could explain why antiseizure medications, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are being prescribed more for radicular low back pain than other back pain, despite the lack of evidence showing that they are effective. Systemic corticosteroids continue to be used for Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old.

Our review supports clinical practice guidelines that found insufficient evidence to recommend most physical modalities other than superficial heat. However, these therapies are still commonly used in clinical practice. Among nonpharmacological therapies that were found to be effective, there was insufficient evidence to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from specific therapies. However, a recent trial found that a stratified approach (in which patients are assessed for risk factors for chronicity and higher risk patients receive more intensive cognitive-behavioral-based physical therapy) is more effective than usual care without a stratified approach, suggesting that psychologically based therapies and multidisciplinary rehabilitation may be the most effective approach in higher risk patients. 78 Other factors that may impact decisions regarding which nonpharmacological therapies to use include cost, availability, and patient preferences. There is some evidence that greater patient expectations of benefit from a particular treatment are associated with greater benefits, 79,80 suggesting that patient preferences should be considered in the selection of therapies. Barriers to use of some nonpharmacological therapies include high out-of-pocket expenses (e.g., for complementary and alternative medicine therapies) and nonavailability depending on locale or other factors (e.g., multidisciplinary rehabilitation). Limitations of the Review Process We included previously published systematic reviews. The reliability of systematic reviews depends on the rigor with which they are conducted.81 Therefore, we focused on higher quality reviews. We did not conduct meta-analyses or update meta-analyses included in prior systematic reviews. However, for comparisons without a meta-analysis, we synthesized results qualitatively, using the methods in the AHRQ Methods Guide. For comparisons for which pooled results were available from prior systematic reviews, we evaluated the consistency of results from new trials against the pooled estimates. Other limitations of the review process are that we excluded non-English language articles and did not search for studies published only as abstracts. We were unable to assess for publication bias using graphical or statistical methods to detect small sample effects; methodological limitations in the trials; heterogeneity in the interventions, populations, and outcomes addressed; and small numbers of trials for many comparisons. However, based on searches of reference lists, clinical trials registries, and peer review suggestions, we did not find evidence to suggest that unpublished trials would impact conclusions. There are other noninvasive interventions for low back pain that we did not address\u2014herbal medicines, 82 educational interventions,83,84 advice to remain active,83,85 mattresses, shoe insoles,86 and others.87,88 We also did not include comparisons of noninvasive therapies versus surgery or interventional procedures; trials of such comparisons appear to be relatively uncommon. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.ES-41Limitations of the Evidence Base The evidence base had a number of important limitations. As noted previously, evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for radicular low back pain was sparse. Most trials of nonpharmacological treatments focused on patients with chronic low back pain. A number of interventions were evaluated in small numbers of trials or in trials that had important methodological limitations, precluding strong conclusions. There were relatively few head-to-head trials of different interventions. Another limitation of the evidence base is that studies were frequently short term and often evaluated patients only at the end of a course of therapy, making it difficult to determine long-term effects. In addition, many trials reported mean changes in outcome measures (typically pain and function) but did not report dichotomized outcomes (e.g., 30% or 50% pain relief or functional improvement). Because responses to pain treatments tend to be bimodal, 89 with patients tending to experience no benefit or marked benefit, assessment of outcomes based on continuous outcomes could obscure treatment effects. Some limitations of the evidence were particularly relevant for trials of nonpharmacological interventions. Studies of nonpharmacological interventions were typically characterized by marked heterogeneity in the specific intervention techniques evaluated, as well as in the duration and intensity of treatments, which could attenuate treatment benefits if suboptimal treatment techniques or intensity of therapy were evaluated. In addition, a number of nonpharmacological therapies (e.g., psychological therapies, exercise therapy, massage, spinal manipulation) are difficult to blind effectively. Therefore, observed benefits could be due in part to placebo, attentional, or other nonspecific effects, and results are susceptible to performance and other biases, although it is not possible to reliably quantify the extent of such effects. Finally, trials of nonpharmacological therapies did not report harms well; this could be in part because serious harms are not expected with most of these treatments. Research Gaps A number of research gaps limit the full understanding of the effectiveness, comparative effectiveness, and harms of therapies for low back pain. More research is needed to determine effective treatments for low back pain with radicular symptoms. Trials should be designed to evaluate patients not just immediately after they have completed therapy but for longer periods of time, in order to help understand how long effects of treatment persist. For nonpharmacological treatments, research to identify optimal treatment techniques and regimens (including intensity and duration of treatments) would be helpful for defining more standardized interventions to be evaluated in trials. Studies are needed to determine the long-term effectiveness and harms of opioids for chronic low back pain, including higher risk patients similar to those commonly encountered in clinical practice. Observational studies that are designed to assess serious long-term harms provide some evidence regarding risks of opioids for chronic pain in general, but data specifically on patients with low back pain are lacking. 36 For systemic corticosteroids, the largest trial to date was recently completed and should help further characterize the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of this treatment. 90 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.ES-42More research is needed to help understand which patients are most likely to benefit from specific therapies.91-95 Trials are also needed to confirm whether effects of risk-stratified approaches are reproducible in the United States96,97 and to optimize their implementation.98 More research is also needed to better understand whether combination therapy with different pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatments is associated with incremental benefits versus individual components of the combination therapy, and which combinations and sequences of therapy are the most effective. Pain relief was the most commonly assessed outcome in trials of treatment for low back pain, followed by back-specific function. Trials should consistently assess other outcomes related to return to work, quality of life, and health care use in order to provide a more complete picture of treatment effects. Studies that evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for preventing future episodes of low back pain would also be very helpful, as low back pain can be a recurrent episodic condition and these patients are likely to account for a high proportion of resources. In order to provide balanced assessments of low back pain interventions, trials should more consistently and rigorously evaluate and report harms. Conclusions A number of pharmacological and nonpharmacological noninvasive treatments for low back pain are associated with small to moderate, primarily short-term, effects on pain versus placebo, sham, wait list, or no treatment. Effects on function are generally smaller than effects on pain. More research is needed to understand optimal selection of treatments, effective combinations and sequencing of treatments, and effectiveness of treatments for radicular low back pain.

Up to 84 percent of adults have low back pain at some time in their lives, and over one quarter of U.S. adults report recent (in the last 3 months) low back pain. 1, 2 Low back pain can have major adverse impacts on quality of life and function. Low back pain is also costly\u2014in 1998, total US health care expenditures for low back pain were estimated at $90 billion. 3 Since that time, costs of low back pain care have risen at a rate higher than observed for overall health expenditures.4 In addition to high direct costs, low back pain is one of the most common reasons for missed work or reduced productivity while at work, resulting in high indirect costs. 5 The prognosis for acute low back pain (generally defined as an episode lasting less than 4 weeks) is generally favorable. Most patients experience a rapid improvement in (and often a complete resolution of) pain and disability and are able to return to work. 6 In those with persistent symptoms, continued improvement is often seen in the subacute phase between 4 to 12 weeks, though at a slower rate than observed at first. In a minority of patients, low back pain lasts longer than 12 weeks, at which point it is considered chronic; levels of pain and disability often remain relatively constant thereafter. 7 Recently, a National Institutes of Health Research Task Force defined chronic low back pain as a back pain problem that has persisted at least 3 months and has resulted in pain on at least half the days in the past 6 months. 8 Patients with chronic back pain account for the bulk of the burdens and costs of low back pain.9, 10 Predictors of chronicity are primarily related to psychosocial factors, such as presence of psychological comorbidities, maladaptive coping strategies (such as fear avoidance [avoiding activities because of fears that they will further damage the back] or catastrophizing [anticipating the worst possible outcomes from low back pain]), presence of nonorganic signs (symptoms without a distinct anatomical or physiological basis), 11 high baseline functional impairment, low general health status, and others.7 Back pain is frequently associated with presence of depression and anxiety. Attributing symptoms of low back pain to a specific disease or spinal pathology is a challenge.12 Spinal imaging abnormalities such as degenerative disc disease, facet joint arthropathy, and bulging or herniated intervertebral discs are extremely common in patients with or without low back pain, particularly in older adults, and such findings are poor predictors for the presence or severity of low back pain. 13 Radiculopathy from nerve root impingement (often due to a herniated intervertebral disc) or spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) are each present in about 4 to 5 percent of patients with low back pain and can cause neurological symptoms such as lower extremity pain, paresthesias, and weakness; the natural history and response to treatment for these conditions may differ from back pain without neurologic involvement. 14 Interventions for Low Back Pain Multiple treatment options for acute and chronic low back pain are available. Broadly, these can be classified as pharmacological treatments, 15 noninvasive nonpharmacological treatments,16 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.2injection therapies,17 and surgical treatments.18 This report focuses on the comparative benefits and harms of pharmacological and noninvasive nonpharmacological treatments; each of these categories encompasses a number of different therapies. Pharmacological treatments corticosteroids; nonpharmacological treatments include exercise and related interventions (e.g., yoga), complementary and alternative therapies (e.g., spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and massage), psychological therapies (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, and operant therapy), physical modalities (e.g., traction, ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS], low level laser therapy, interferential therapy, superficial heat or cold, back supports, and magnets), and multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Rationale for Evidence Review The burden of low back pain, the numerous noninvasive treatment options to be considered by clinicians and patients, and the availability of new evidence and interventions (e.g., duloxetine) warrant a comprehensive comparative effectiveness review of this topic. An existing guideline 14 and associated systematic reviews15, 16 from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society were published in 2007, emphasizing the role of pharmacological therapies and noninvasive nonpharmacological therapies for low back pain in most situations. A systematic evidence review that includes recently published research, explores potential variability in response to treatment depending on patient characteristics, considers multiple outcomes related to pain and function, and separately considers benefits and harms of interventions for acute or chronic nonradicular low back pain, as well as conditions such as radiculopathy and spinal stenosis, may provide a better understanding of the comparative effectiveness of treatment options for acute and chronic low back pain and could be used to update existing clinical recommendations. To aid in the efficiency of the review process, this review will be conducted as an update of prior systematic reviews on pharmacological and nonpharmacological noninvasive treatments used to develop the 2007 APS/ACP clinical practice guideline and conducted by the same review team. 15, 16 Scope of Review and Key Questions The Key Questions; populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, settings, and study designs (PICOTS); and analytic framework used to guide this review are shown below. Key Question 1. What are the comparative benefits and harms of dif ferent pharmacological therapies for acute or chronic nonradicular low back pain, radicular low back pain, or spinal and topical/patch-delivered medications. Key Question 2.

The Scientific Resource Center developed preliminary Key Questions based on input from the topic nominator. An Evidence-based Practice Center further revised the Key Questions and defined the populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, and study designs (PICOTS) of interest with input from a group of Key Informants assembled for this purpose. Key Informants disclosed financial and other conflicts of interest prior to participation. The AHRQ Task Order Officer and the investigators reviewed the disclosures and determined that the Key Informants had no conflicts of interest that precluded participation. The provisional Key Questions, PICOTS, and analytic framework were posted on the AHRQ Web site for public comment from December 17, 2013, through January 17, 2014. After reviewing public comments, the research team at our Evidence-based Practice Center developed the final protocol with input from AHRQ and a Technical Expert Panel (TEP) convened for this report. The TEP consisted of 14 members with expertise in primary care, pain medicine, behavioral sciences, physical medicine and rehabilitation, complementary and alternative therapies, physical therapy, occupational medicine, and pharmacology. TEP members disclosed financial and other conflicts of interest prior to participation. The AHRQ Task Order Officer and the investigators reviewed the disclosures and determined that the Key Informants had no conflicts of interest that precluded participation. Some changes were made in response to public comments. The PICOTS were revised to include tai chi as an intervention and the time between back pain episodes was added as an outcome. The Key Questions and PICOTS were also revised to include combinations of therapies as interventions and comparators. We made additional wording edits to the Key Questions to clarify inclusion of oral and topical pharmacological therapies and to group the nonpharmacological noninvasive therapies into related categories (e.g., exercise and related interventions, complementary and alternative therapies, psychological therapies, and physical modalities). We also revised the PICOTS to be clearer that the population included patients with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain, and added self-directed care to the setting description. The final version of the protocol for this CER was posted on the AHRQ Effective Health Care Program web site (www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov) on October 9, 2014. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews. Literature Search Strategy A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, through August 2014 (see Appendix A for full search strategies). We restricted search start dates to January 2008 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.7because searches in the prior APS/ACP review, were conducted through October 2008; the APS/ ACP review was used to identify studies published prior to 2008.20 For interventions (electrical muscle stimulation, taping, tai chi) not addressed in the APS/ACP review, we searched the same databases without a search date start restriction. We also hand-searched the reference lists of relevant studies and searched for unpublished studies in ClinicalTrials.gov. We conducted an update search in April 2015 using the same search strategy as in the original search. Study Selection We developed criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies based on the Key Questions and PICOTS, in accordance with the AHRQ Methods Guide.21 Inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized below and described in more detail in Appendix B. Abstracts were reviewed by two investigators, and all citations deemed potentially appropriate for inclusion by at least one of the reviewers was retrieved. Two investigators then independently reviewed all full-text articles for final inclusion. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus. A list of the included studies can be found in Appendix C; excluded studies and primary reason for exclusion can be found in Appendix D. Population and Condition of Interest This report focuses on adults with low back pain of any duration (categorized as acute [<4 weeks], subacute [4 to nonradicular and radicular low back pain. Radicular pain was defined as back pain with leg pain, with or without sensory or motor deficits in a nerve root distribution; radicular pain could be based on clinical presentation or require imaging correlation (e.g., due to herniated disc or spinal stenosis). Patients with nonradicular low back pain could have nonspecific imaging findings such as degenerative disc disease, bulging intervertebral disc, or facet joint arthropathy. Patients with low back pain due to cancer, infection, inflammatory arthropathy, high velocity trauma, fracture, low back pain during pregnancy, and low back pain associated with severe or progressive neurological deficits were excluded. Interventions and Comparisons We included pharmacologic and noninvasive, nonpharmacological therapies for low back pain. Pharmacological therapies were restricted to those administered orally or topically; we evaluated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory lidocaine. We excluded studies of medications administered intravenously but included studies of medications administered intramuscularly. Nonpharmacological therapies were multidisciplinary rehabilitation (also known as interdisciplinary rehabilitation, which we defined as a coordinated program with both physical and biopsychosocial treatment components (e.g., exercise therapy and cognitive behavioral Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.8therapy) provided by professionals from at least two different specialties; psychological therapies; exercise and related interventions (e.g., yoga and tai chi); complementary and alternative therapies (spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and massage); passive physical modalities (heat, cold, ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS], electrical muscle stimulation [EMS], interferential therapy [IFT], short-wave diathermy, level laser therapy [LLLT], and lumbar supports or braces); and taping. Although we placed nonpharmacological interventions into broad groupings for the purpose of organizing the report, this was not meant to imply that they are associated with similar effectiveness or necessarily based on similar mechanisms of action, and the benefits and harms of each intervention was evaluated separately. Interventional therapies involving injections to the spine, ablative therapies, and surgical therapies were excluded. For opioids, we excluded the drug propoxyphene, a weak analgesic associated with risk of cardiac arrhythmia which is no longer available in the United States or Europe. For skeletal muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines, we included drugs not available in the United States but available in Europe, but noted such instances. Comparisons were of an included therapy versus placebo (drug trials), sham (functionally inert) treatments (nonpharmacological intervention), no treatment, wait list, or usual care (usually defined as care as typically provided at the discretion of the clinician, though components of usual care varied across studies and settings), as well as comparisons of one included therapy versus another. We also evaluated comparisons of the combination of one included therapy plus another included therapy, versus one of the therapies alone. We excluded comparisons involving multicomponent therapy that did not meet the definition for multidisciplinary rehabilitation and did not compare the effects of the multicomponent therapy versus individual components, because it is not possible to determine the incremental benefits of multicomponent therapy over its individual components from such comparisons. Outcomes, Timing, and Setting We evaluated effects of interventions on reduction or elimination of low back pain, including related leg symptoms, improvement in back-specific and overall function, improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQOL), reduction in work disability/return to work, global improvement, number of back pain episodes or time between episodes, and patient satisfaction. Of these outcomes, pain and function were the most consistently reported, and we designated them as priority outcomes for the purpose of reporting results. We also evaluated adverse effects, including serious adverse events (e.g., anaphylaxis with medications, neurological complications, and death) and less serious adverse events. When possible, timing of outcomes was stratified as long term (at least 1 year) and short term (up to 6 months); we also noted outcomes assessed immediately after the completion of a course of treatment. We included studies conducted in inpatient or outpatient settings. Study Designs Given the large number of interventions and comparisons addressed in this review, we included systematic reviews of randomized trials.22, 23 For each intervention, we selected the systematic review that was the most relevant to our Key Questions and scope (as defined in the PICOTS), had the most recent search dates, and was of highest quality based on assessments Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.9using the AMSTAR tool.24 We included nonoverlapping reviews of the same intervention that addressed specific outcomes, populations, or interventions, and in some cases included more than one overlapping review that was similar in terms of search dates and quality, if we could not identify a single best \"match.\" If good-quality systematic reviews were not available, we included fair-quality systematic reviews only if we could address the methodological shortcomings of the review (e.g., if a review reported overall risk of bias of studies but did not report details regarding specific methodological shortcomings, we assessed the risk of bias in the primary studies ourselves). We preferentially selected good-quality systematic reviews that were more comprehensive (e.g., a systematic review on exercise therapy in general, versus a specific type of exercise therapy) or were updates of reviews included in the APS/ACP review. We compared the results of our report with the findings from systematic reviews that were not included in the discussion. We supplemented systematic reviews with randomized trials that were not included in the reviews. We did not include systematic reviews identified in update searches, but checked reference lists for additional randomized trials. For harms, we included cohort studies for interventions and comparisons when randomized trials were sparse or unavailable. We excluded case-control studies, case reports, and case series. We only included non-English language articles included in English-language systematic reviews. We noted English language abstracts of non-English language articles to identify studies that would otherwise meet inclusion criteria, in order to help assess for the likelihood of language bias. Studies only published as conference abstracts were excluded, but we noted studies published only as abstracts that otherwise met inclusion criteria, to help assess for potential publication bias. Data Extraction and Data Management For systematic reviews we abstracted the following data: inclusion criteria, search strategy, databases searched, search dates, the number of included studies, study characteristics of included studies (e.g., sample sizes, interventions, duration of treatment, duration of followup, comparison, and results), methods of quality assessment, quality ratings for included studies, methods for synthesis, and results. We did not abstract data for primary studies included in systematic reviews. Rather, we relied on the information provided in the review. For primary studies not included in systematic reviews, we abstracted the following data: study design, year, setting, country, sample size, eligibility criteria, population and clinical characteristics, intervention characteristics, and results. Information relevant for assessing applicability was also abstracted, including the characteristics of the population, interventions, and care settings; the use of run-in or washout periods, and the number of patients enrolled relative to the number assessed for eligibility. All study data were verified for accuracy and completeness by a second team member. See Appendix E for evidence tables with extracted data. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.10Assessing Methodological Quality of Individual Studies Two investigators independently assessed quality (risk of bias) of systematic reviews and primary studies not included in systematic reviews using predefined criteria, with disagreements resolved by consensus. Randomized trials were evaluated using criteria and methods developed by the Cochrane Back Review Group 25 and cohort studies were evaluated using criteria developed by the US Preventive Services Task Force.26 Systematic reviews were assessed using the AMSTAR quality rating instrument.23 These criteria and methods were used in conjunction with the approach recommended in AHRQ Methods Guide.22 Studies were rated as \"good,\" \"fair,\" or \"poor.\" We re-reviewed the quality ratings of studies included in the prior American Pain Society review to ensure consistency in quality assessment. 24 For primary studies included in systematic reviews, we relied on the quality ratings or risk of bias assessments as performed in the systematic reviews, as long as they used a standardized method for assessing quality (e.g., Cochrane Back Review Group, Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, PEDro tool). We used the overall grade (e.g., good, fair, or poor; or high or low) as presented in the systematic review, and provided details about the methods used to categorize studies (e.g., \"higher quality\" defined as meeting more than 6 of 11 Cochrane Back Review Group criteria). If we were uncertain about the methods used to assess risk of bias, or quality, we assessed the quality of individual studies ourselves, using the methods described above. In some cases, we supplemented the quality ratings from the reviews with additional methodological considerations. Primary studies rated \"good\" are considered to have the least risk of bias, and their results are generally considered valid. Good-quality studies use valid methods to select patients for inclusion and allocate patients to treatment; report similar baseline characteristics in different treatment groups; clearly report attrition and have low attrition; use appropriate methods to reduce performance bias (e.g., blinding of patients, care providers, and outcome assessors), and use appropriate analytic methods (e.g., intention-to-treat analysis; for cohort studies, adjustment for potential confounders). Studies rated \"fair\" are susceptible to some bias, though not enough to necessarily invalidate the results. These studies may not meet all the criteria for a rating of good quality, but no flaw is likely to cause major bias. The study may also be missing information, making it difficult to assess limitations and potential problems. The fair-quality category is broad, and studies with this rating will vary in their strengths and weaknesses. The results of some fair-quality studies are likely to be valid, while others may be only possibly valid. Studies rated \"poor\" have significant flaws that imply biases of various types that may invalidate the results. They have a serious or \"fatal\" flaw in design, analysis, or reporting, such as inadequate methods for allocating patients to treatment; large amounts of missing information; discrepancies in reporting; or serious problems in the delivery of the intervention. The results of these studies are at least as likely to reflect flaws in the study design as the true difference between the compared interventions. We did not exclude studies rated poor quality a priori, but such studies were considered to be less reliable than higher-quality studies when synthesizing the evidence, particularly when discrepancies among studies were present. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.11For systematic reviews that classified studies as \"higher\" versus \"lower\" quality, we considered \"higher\" to incorporate good-quality and better fair-quality studies, and \"lower\" to include poor-quality studies and fair-quality studies with more methodological shortcomings. Systematic reviews rated \"good\" had to use of multiple sources in the literature search, apply predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, assess quality using an appropriate tool, use methods to reduce errors in data abstraction and quality rating (e.g., multiple independent reviewers), use appropriate methods for evidence synthesis (qualitative or quantitative), and use an explicit system for considering the body of evidence that includes the major domains of strength of evidence (risk of bias, consistency, precision, and directness). As noted above, we included systematic reviews that had shortcomings in one or more of these areas only if we could address the shortcomings (e.g., by assessing quality of the primary studies ourselves or independently determining strength of evidence from the information provided in the review). For further details about the quality of included studies see Appendix F . Assessing Applicability We recorded factors important for understanding the applicability of studies, such as whether the publication adequately described the study sample, the country in which the study was conducted, the characteristics of the patient sample (e.g., age, sex, race, duration and severity of pain, presence of radicular symptoms, medical comorbidities, and psychosocial factors), the characteristics of the interventions used (e.g., specific intervention, dose or intensity, duration of treatment), the clinical setting (e.g., primary care or specialty setting), and the magnitude of effects on clinical outcomes, as well as timing of assessments. 27 We classified the magnitude of effects for pain and function using the same system as in the APS/ACP review.14, 28 A small/ slight effect was defined for pain as a mean between-group difference following treatment of 5 to 10 points on a 0- to 100-point visual analogue scale (V AS), 0.5 to 1.0 points on a 0- to 10-point numerical rating scale, or equivalent; for function as a mean difference of 5- to 10-point difference on the 0- to 100-point Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) or 1 to 2 points on the 0- to 24-point Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), or equivalent; and for any outcome as a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.2 to 0.5. A moderate effect was defined for pain as a mean difference of 10 to 20 points on a 0- to 100-point V AS, for function as a mean difference of 10 to 20 points on the ODI or 2 to 5 points on the RDQ, and for any outcome as an SMD of 0.5 to 0.8. Large/substantial effects were defined as greater than moderate. Proposed thresholds for minimum clinically important changes in studies of low back pain are 15 on a 0- to 100-point visual analogue pain scale, 5 points on the RDQ, or 10 for the ODI, roughly correlating with the \"moderate\" classification. 28 However, the clinical relevance of effects classified as small/slight might vary for individual patients depending on preferences, baseline symptom severity, harms, cost, and other factors. We also recorded the funding source and role of the sponsor. Applicability depends on the particular question and the needs of the user of the review. There is no generally accepted universal rating system for applicability. In addition, applicability depends in part on context. Therefore, a rating of applicability (such as \"high\" or \"low\") was not assigned because applicability may differ based on the user of this report.

Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.12Evidence Synthesis and Rating the Body of Evidence We synthesized data qualitatively (see Grading the Strength of Evidence, below). Results are organized by Key Question and intervention, organized according to the duration of symptoms (acute, subacute, or chronic), type of low back pain (nonradicular or radicular low back pain), and type of comparison (e.g., versus placebo or sham, versus usual care, or versus another active intervention) with prioritized outcomes (pain, function) presented first. Synthesis was based on the totality of evidence (i.e., evidence included in the prior APS/ACP review plus new evidence). We synthesized results for continuous as well as dichotomous outcomes. We reported binary outcomes based on the proportion of patients achieving successful pain, function, or some composite overall measure of success as defined in the trials, which varied in how they categorized successful outcomes (e.g., >30% improvement in pain score vs. >50% improvement vs. \"good\" or \"excellent\" outcomes on a categorical scale). See Appendix G for descriptions of the outcome measures used in the included studies. In addition, we reported meta-analysis from systematic reviews that reported pooled estimates from studies that were judged to be homogeneous enough to provide a meaningful combined estimate and used appropriate pooling methods (e.g., random effects model in the presence of statistical heterogeneity). When statistical heterogeneity was present, we examined the type of inconsistency present (e.g., did some trials find that an intervention was more effective than placebo and other no effect, or did most trials find that the intervention was more effective, but varied in the strength of the estimate) and evaluated subgroup and sensitivity analyses based on study characteristics, intervention factors, and patient factors. We did not conduct updated meta-analysis with new studies. Rather, we qualitatively examined whether results of new studies were consistent with pooled or qualitative findings from prior systematic reviews. When we included more than one systematic review for a particular intervention and comparison, we evaluated the consistency of results among reviews. When findings among reviews were discordant, we evaluated potential sources of discordance, such as differential inclusion of studies, differences in ratings for risk of bias, or differences in methods used to synthesize evidence. Grading the Strength of Evidence for Each Key Question We assessed the strength of evidence for each Key Question and outcome using the approach described in the AHRQ Methods Guide,21 based on the overall quality of each body of evidence, the quality (graded good, fair, or poor); the consistency of results across studies (graded consistent, inconsistent, or unable to determine when only one study was available); the directness of the evidence linking the intervention and health outcomes (graded direct or indirect); the precision of the estimate of effect, based on the number and size of studies and confidence intervals (CI) for the estimates (graded precise or imprecise); and reporting bias (suspected of undetected). The strength of evidence was based on the totality of evidence (i.e., evidence in prior reviews as well as new evidence). Assessments of reporting bias were based on whether studies defined and reported primary outcomes, identification of relevant unpublished studies, and when available, by comparing Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.13published results to results reported in trial registries. We graded the strength of evidence for each Key Question using the four key categories recommended in the AHRQ Methods Guide.21 A \"high\" grade indicates high confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect and that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. A \"moderate\" grade indicates moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect and further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. A \"low\" grade indicates low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect and further research is likely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. An \"insufficient\" grade indicates evidence either is unavailable or is too limited to permit any conclusion, due to the availability of only poor-quality studies, extreme inconsistency, or extreme imprecision. See Appendix H for the strength of evidence table.

What are the comparative benefits and harms of dif ferent pharmacological therapies for acute or chronic nonradicular low back pain, radicular low back pain, or spinal medications. Acetaminophen Key Points For acute low back pain, one good-quality trial found no difference between acetaminophenversus placebo in pain intensity or function through 3 weeks (strength of evidence [SOE]:low for pain and function). For acute low back pain, a systematic review found no difference between acetaminophenversus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in pain intensity (3 mean difference (SMD) 0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02 to 0.43) orlikelihood of experiencing global improvement (3 trials, relative risk [RR] 0.81, 95%CI 0.58 to 1.14) at 3 weeks, though estimates favored NSAIDs and the estimate wasimprecise (SOE: insufficient) For chronic low back pain, no study evaluated acetaminophen versus placebo, and therewas insufficient evidence from one trial to determine effects of acetaminophen versusNSAIDs (SOE: insufficient). There was insufficient evidence from four trials to determine effects of acetaminophenversus other interventions (SOE: insufficient). No study evaluated acetaminophen for radicular low back pain. One trial found no difference between scheduled acetaminophen, as-neededacetaminophen, or placebo in risk of serious adverse events (~1% in each group) and asystematic review found acetaminophen associated with lower risk of side effects versusNSAIDs (3 trials, RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.89) (SOE: moderate). Detailed review29 included eight trials of acetaminophen (Appendix Tables E1, F1). One trial evaluated acetaminophen versus no treatment,30 five trials included in a systematic review31, 32 evaluated acetaminophen versus various NSAIDs,30, 33-36 and three trials evaluated acetaminophen versus other interventions (amitriptyline,37 electroacupuncture,38 and manipulation, corset, or physical therapy39). The sample size was 456 in one trial39 and ranged from 40 to 70 in the others. One trial evaluated acetaminophen for chronic low back pain, 34 one mixed acute to chronic low back pain,39 and the remainder acute low back pain. No trial specifically focused on patients with radiculopathy. Acetaminophen doses were 4 g/day in 3 trials, 33-35 3 g/day in 1 trial,30 2 g/day in one trial,37 and unclear in 3 trials.37-39 Duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 5 weeks. Four trials evaluated patients at 3 to 9 weeks after the Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.17completion of therapy30, 35, 38, 39 and the remainder evaluated patients at the end of therapy. Two trials34, 37 were classified as higher quality (based on meeting fewer than 6 of 11 validity criteria) and the remainder classified as lower quality. Methodological shortcomings included inadequate or unclear randomization and allocation concealment methods, unblinded design, and failure to avoid cointerventions. The APS/ACP review concluded that there was good evidence that acetaminophen was associated with moderate effects for acute and chronic low back pain, based primarily on evidence that acetaminophen and NSAIDs were associated with similar effectiveness in most trials, and trials that evaluated effects of acetaminophen for other pain conditions. An update 40, 41 to the systematic review32 of acetaminophen versus NSAIDs included one additional high-quality trial (n=371) of patients with acute pain (Table 1).42 Acetaminophen was compared against ibuprofen, a heat wrap, an unheated wrap, and placebo after a 4-day course of therapy. However, results were only reported for the comparisons of acetaminophen versus ibuprofen or heat wrap. We identified one additional good-quality trial (n=1643) of scheduled (~4 g/day) or as-needed (up to 4 g/day) acetaminophen for up to 4 weeks versus placebo for acute low back pain (Table 2, Appendix Tables E2, F2). 43 Followup was conducted through 12 weeks. Acetaminophen V ersus Placebo or No Treatment Acute Low Back Pain One good-quality trial (n=1093) published subsequent to the systematic reviews found no differences between scheduled acetaminophen ~4 g/day, as-needed acetaminophen up to 4 g/day, and placebo in pain, function, sleep quality, and SF-12 measures in patients with acute low back pain (~20% with radicular symptoms) through 12 weeks. 43 Differences between acetaminophen and placebo were 0.2 points on a 0-10 pain scale and 0.6 on the 0-24 Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ). There were also no differences in days to recovery, use of concomitant medications or health services, or hours absent from work. A low-quality trial (n=70) included in the APS/ACP review found no differences between acetaminophen (3 g/day) versus no treatment in likelihood of recovery (54% vs. 82%, p>0.05) after a 1-week course of treatment. 30 However, more patients had thoracic than lumbar back pain in this trial. Chronic Low Back Pain No trial evaluated acetaminophen versus placebo or no treatment for chronic low back pain. Acetaminophen V ersus NSAIDs Acute Low Back Pain For acute low back pain, a systematic review of low-quality trials found no difference between acetaminophen versus NSAIDs in pain intensity (3 trials, pooled SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.43) or likelihood of experiencing global improvement (3 trials, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.58 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.18to 1.14) at 3 weeks, though estimates favored NSAIDs.41 Another low-quality trial (n=50) that was not included in the meta-analysis also found no differences.35 Chronic Low Back Pain For chronic low back pain, a small (n=29), high-quality trial found diflunisal associated with higher likelihood of a patient rating of therapeutic efficacy as \"good\" or \"excellent\" versus acetaminophen after 4 weeks, but the difference was not statistically significant (62% vs. 33%, RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 4.55). 34 Acetaminophen V ersus Other Interventions Acute Low Back Pain Four trials found no clear differences between acetaminophen versus nonpharmacologic therapies (heat wrap therapy, electroacupuncture, physical therapy, corset, or spinal manipulation) 38, 39, 42 or amitriptyline,37 but there was insufficient evidence to reach reliable conclusions because each comparison was only evaluated in one trial and the studies had methodological shortcomings. Chronic Low Back Pain No trial evaluated acetaminophen versus other interventions for chronic low back pain. Harms One good-quality trial found no difference between scheduled acetaminophen, as-needed acetaminophen, or placebo in risk of serious adverse events (~1% in each group).43 A systematic review found acetaminophen associated with lower risk of side effects versus NSAIDs (3 trials, RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.89).41 One trial found no difference between acetaminophen versus a heat wrap in risk of systemic adverse events (4.4% vs. 6.2%, RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.18), with no serious adverse events in either group. 42 Adverse events were not reported in other trials of acetaminophen versus other interventions.37-39 NSAIDs Key Points For acute low back pain, a systematic review found NSAIDs associated with greaterimprovement in pain intensity versus placebo (4 studies, weighted mean difference [WMD]8.39, 95% CI 12.68 to 4.10; chi-square 3.47, p>0.1), but four trials found no cleareffects on the likelihood of achieving significant pain relief. One subsequent trial wasconsistent with these findings. One trial found NSAIDs associated with better functionversus placebo (SOE: moderate for pain, low for function). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found NSAIDs associated with greaterimprovement in pain versus placebo (4 trials, WMD 12.40, 95% CI 15.53 to 9.26;chi-square 1.82, p>0.5); two trials found NSAIDs associated with greater improvement infunction (SOE: moderate for pain, low for function). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.19 For radicular low back pain, a systematic review found no difference in pain intensity between NSAIDs versus placebo (2 trials, WMD 0.16, 95% CI 11.92 to 11.59, chi-square 7.25, p<0.01) (SOE: low). There was insufficient evidence from two trials of an NSAID plus another intervention (skeletal muscle relaxants or massage) versus the other intervention alone to determine effectiveness (SOE: insufficient). There was insufficient evidence from two trials to determine the effects of NSAIDs versus doloteffin or exercise (SOE: insufficient) A systematic review found that most trials of one NSAID versus another found no differences in pain relief in patients with acute low back pain (15 of 21 trials) or chronic low back pain (6 of 6 trials) (SOE: moderate). A systematic review found NSAIDs associated with more side effects versus placebo (10 trials, RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.68); COX-2-selective NSAIDs were associated with lower risk of side effects versus nonselective NSAIDs (4 trials; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99). Serious harms were rare. (SOE: moderate) Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included a good-quality systematic review with 51 trials of NSAIDs.31, 44 The review found nonselective NSAIDs for acute (6 trials) and chronic (1 trial) low back pain moderately more effective than placebo for outcomes related to pain and function. The APS/ACP review also found no evidence that any nonselective NSAID is superior to another for pain relief based on 24 trials, or when compared with other active interventions (e.g., other medications or passive physical modalities.) None of the trials in the systematic review evaluated a COX-2 selective NSAID. We identified an updated version of the systematic review described above (Table 1, Appendix Tables E3, F3). 41 It included 65 trials (total n=11,237) of NSAIDs versus placebo (16 trials), other active interventions (13 trials), or one type of NSAID versus another (33 trials), including five trials of COX-2 (meloxicam, nimesulide, COX-2-selective NSAIDs evaluated in the trials, the only one available in the United States is meloxicam. Eleven trials investigated diclofenac sodium, eight trials ibuprofen, seven trials piroxicam, seven trials diflunisal, four trials naproxen, and 23 trials evaluated other NSAIDs. Nine trials of NSAIDs versus acetaminophen are discussed in the acetaminophen section of this report. Four trials in the systematic review of NSAIDs plus vitamin B versus NSAIDs alone are outside the scope of this review and not discussed further. Of the studies in the systematic review, 37 were conducted in patients with acute low back pain, nine in patients with chronic low back pain, and the remainder in patients with mixed or unclear duration of pain. Six studies included only patients with sciatica, 25 included low back pain without sciatica and 34 evaluated a mixed population or did not specify whether or not patients had sciatica. Treatment schedules and doses varied across studies. Medications were taken 1 to 6 times per day, and doses varied widely (i.e., ibuprofen doses ranged from 800 to 2400 mg per day, diclofenac doses ranged from 48 to 150 mg per day). Duration of treatment ranged from 1 day to 12 weeks, and followup ranged from 2 days to 6 months. 28 studies were rated high- Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.20quality by the systematic review, based on meeting at least 6 of 11 Cochrane Back Review Group criteria; the other 37 were rated low quality. Common methodological shortcomings of the low-quality studies included inadequate details regarding randomization and allocation concealment methods and cointerventions. 41 We identified three additional trials (n=54 to 193) not included in the systematic review of NSAIDs for acute (including recurrent)50 or subacute51, 52 low back pain (Table 3; Appendix E4, F4). One trial compared lornoxicam, diclofenac, and placebo,50 one trial an NSAID plus deep tissue massage versus deep tissue massage alone,51 and one trial an NSAID (loxoprofen sodium, diclofenac sodium, or zaltoprofen) versus exercise.52 One trial was rated good quality,52 and two were rated fair quality.50, 51 Methodological shortcomings of the fair-quality trials included inadequate description of randomization, blinding and avoidance of cointerventions. NSAID V ersus Placebo Acute Low Back Pain The systematic review included 11 studies of NSAIDs versus placebo for acute low back pain;45, 53-62 studies that focused on patients with acute sciatica are discussed separately. In studies of patients without sciatica or in mixed populations with or without sciatica,45, 53, 54, 60 NSAIDs were associated with greater improvements in pain intensity versus placebo (4 studies, WMD 8.39, 95% CI 12.68 to 4.10; chi-square 3.47, p>0.1). 41 Four studies reported did not report changes in mean pain intensity but reported the proportion of patients with pain relief.55, 57, 59, 61 One trial each of indomethacin, phenylbutazone, and diflunisal found no differences between the NSAID versus placebo in the likelihood of achieving pain relief. 55, 57, 61 One trial found piroxicam associated with greater likelihood of pain improvement versus placebo in the subgroup of patients with moderate to severe pain at baseline (82% vs. 53%), but no clear effect in patients with mild pain (49% vs. 38%). 59 Most trials did not report effects of NSAIDS on function. One trial found diclofenac and ibuprofen each associated with greater improvement in the RDQ versus placebo (p<0.001 and p=0.001, respectively). 56 Pooled results from seven studies of NSAIDs versus placebo found a higher proportion of patients taking NSAIDs experienced global improvements after followup of 3 weeks or less (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.33; chi-square 8.39, p>0.1). 45, 55-58, 60, 61 We identified one additional trial (n=171) of lornoxicam or diclofenac versus placebo for acute low back pain or acute exacerbation of low back pain.50 Lornoxicam was associated with lower pain intensity at 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours after the first dose (p0.05 at each time point versus placebo), as measured on a 100 mm point visual analogue scale (V AS). There were no significant differences between lornoxicam and diclofenac for pain intensity or pain relief; function was not assessed. Chronic Low Back Pain The systematic review included four trials of NSAIDs versus placebo for chronic low back pain. 63-66 NSAIDS were associated with greater improvement in pain from baseline to 12 weeks versus placebo (WMD 12.40, 95% CI 15.53 to 9.26; chi-square 1.82, p>0.5).41 Two of the trials found etoricoxib 60 mg 90 mg per day associated with greater improvement on the RDQ Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.21versus placebo (mean differences 2.42, 95% CI 3.87 to 0.98 and 2.06, 95% CI 3.46 to 0.65)64 and rofecoxib 25 mg or 50 mg per day associated with greater improvement versus placebo (mean differences 2.2, 95% CI 3.2 to 1.3 and 2.3, 95% CI 3.3 to 1.3).66 Radicular Low Back Pain The systematic review found no difference in pain intensity between NSAIDs versus placebo in two trials of patients with sciatica (WMD 0.16, 95% CI 11.92 to 11.59).45, 62 Statistical heterogeneity was present (chi-square 7.25, p<0.01). One trial found no difference after 4 weeks of followup between piroxicam for 14 days versus placebo (mean difference 6.00, 95% CI 0.75 to 12.75), 62 but the other trial found meloxicam associated with greater reduction in pain versus placebo after 7 days (mean difference 6.00, 95% CI 11.54 to 0.46).45 One trial included in the systematic review found indomethacin significantly more effective than placebo in the subgroup of patients with nerve root pain, but not in patients without nerve root pain. 58 None of the studies assessed effects on function. NSAIDs Plus Another Intervention V ersus the Other Intervention Without NSAIDs One trial (n=175) in the systematic review found no differences between diflunisal plus the skeletal muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine versus cyclobenzaprine alone in global improvement at 2 or 7 days. 55 One trial (n=54) of deep tissue massage plus NSAID versus deep tissue massage alone for subacute low back pain found no significant differences on the RDQ, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), or pain intensity during rest, motion or mobility of the aching area. 51 NSAIDs V ersus Other Interventions The systematic review included one trial (n=88) of rofecoxib versus doloteffin for chronic low back pain that found no difference in the likelihood of being pain free after 3 or 6 weeks.67 Studies of NSAIDs versus acetaminophen or opioids are discussed in the acetaminophen and opioids sections of this report. One trial (n=193) of an NSAID (loxoprofen, diclofenac, or zaltoprofen) versus trunk strengthening and stretching exercises in patients with chronic low back pain was not included in the systematic review. 52 It found NSAIDs associated with less improvement in quality of life measured by change ratio (improvement from baseline/baseline) on the RDQ (0.47 versus 0.72, p=0.023) and the Japan Low Back Questionnaire (0.44 versus 0.58, p=0.021). One NSAID V ersus Another NSAID The systematic review included thirty-three trials that compared at least two different types of NSAIDs; four evaluated injected NSAIDs which were outside the scope of the current review.41 Only two trials compared the same two NSAIDs (meloxicam versus diclofenac); both found no significant differences. 45, 68 Most (15 of 21) head-to-head trials of different NSAIDs for acute low back pain found no differences in pain or function, and six head-to-head trials of different NSAIDs for chronic low back pain also found no differences. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.22COX-2-Selective NSAID V ersus Traditional NSAID The systematic review included 4 trials of COX-2-selective NSAIDs versus traditional NSAIDs for acute the COX-2-selective NSAIDs evaluated in these trials, meloxicam is the only one available in the United States. A pooled analysis of three trials, including the meloxicam trial, found no differences between the COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs in pain (WMD 1.17, 95% CI 4.67 to 2.33); 45, 47, 48 the fourth trial46 also found no difference.41 The systematic review included one trial of etoricoxib (not available in the United States) versus diclofenac for chronic low back pain that found no difference in pain relief.49 Harms The systematic review included 10 trials that found NSAIDs associated with more side effects versus placebo (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.68).41 It also found COX-2-selective NSAIDs were associated with lower risk of side effects versus traditional NSAIDs (4 trials; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99). Serious harms were rare in the trials. Opioids, Tramadol, and Tapentadol Key Points For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found opioids associated with greater short-term improvement in pain scores (6 trials, SMD 0.43, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.33, I2=0.0%,for a mean difference of ~1 point on a 010 pain scale) and function (four trials, SMD0.26, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.15; I2=0.0%, for a mean difference of ~1 point on the RDQ)versus placebo; three additional trials reported results consistent with the systematic review(SOE: moderate for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found tramadol associated with greatershort-term pain relief versus placebo (5 trials, SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.44,I2=86%, for a mean difference of 1 point or less on a 0-10 pain scale) and function (5trials, SMD 0.18, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.07, mean difference of ~1 point onthe RDQ); two trials not included in the systematic review reported results consistent withthe systematic review findings (SOE: moderate for pain and function). For subacute or chronic low back pain, a systematic review included two trials that foundbuprenorphine patches associated with greater short-term improvement in pain versusplacebo patches; effects on function showed no clear effect or were unclearly reported(SOE: low for pain, insufficient for function). For chronic low back pain, three trials reported inconsistent effects of opioids versusNSAIDS for pain relief, one trial found no difference in function. (SOE: insufficient forpain and function). For acute low back pain, one trial found no significant differences between opioids versusacetaminophen in days to return to work; pain was not reported (SOE: insufficient). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.23 Four trials found no clear differences among different long-acting opioids in pain or function (SOE: moderate for pain and function). Six trials found no clear differences between long-acting versus short-acting opioids in pain relief. Although some trials found long-acting opioids associated with greater pain relief, patients randomized to long-acting opioids also received higher doses of opioids (SOE: low). Short-term use of opioids was associated with higher risk versus placebo of nausea, dizziness, constipation, vomiting, somnolence, and dry mouth; risks of opioids were higher in trials that did not use an enriched enrollment and withdrawal design (SOE: moderate). Trials were not designed to assess risks of overdose, abuse, and addiction, or long-term harms. Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review included nine trials of opioid analgesics for low back pain.29 Sample sizes ranged from 36 to 683 patients. Three trials compared opioids versus placebo or acetaminophen, five trials compared sustained-release versus immediate-release opioid formulations, and two trials compared two different long-acting opioids. Only one trial assessed opioids for acute low back pain; the remainder evaluated opioids for subacute or chronic low back pain. Two trials were rated higher quality. Based on this evidence, the APS/ACP review found fair evidence that opioids are moderately more effective than placebo or no opioid for subacute or chronic low back pain, but insufficient evidence to determine effects for acute low back pain. A recent, good-quality systematic review 69 of opioids for low back pain included 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (reported in 15 publications) (Table 1; Appendix Tables E5, F5). 70-84 Sample sizes ranged from 55 to 981 patients. The opioids evaluated were tapentadol (1 trial), oxycodone (2 trials), (1 extended-release extended-release trials), combinations of oxycodone with naloxone or naltrexone (2 trials), tramadol or the combination of tramadol and acetaminophen (7 trials), and buprenorphine patches (2 trials). In many trials the dose of opioids was titrated to achieve pain relief; maximal doses ranged from 20 to 256 mg of morphine-equivalent doses per day. Tapentadol, morphine, oxymorphone, and tramadol and buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist) were analyzed separately. Fourteen trials compared an opioid versus placebo and two trials compared an opioid versus an NSAID. The duration of treatment ranged from 2 weeks to 13 weeks following titration, and outcomes were assessed through the end of therapy in all trials. The systematic review assessed 13 trials as being at low risk of bias based on meeting 6 of 12 Cochrane Back Review Group criteria. Methodological shortcomings included high attrition, uncertain adherence to treatment, and uncertainty about blinding of outcome assessments. Five trials used the enriched enrollment and randomized withdrawal design described below. We also included three trials (one higher quality 85 and two lower quality36, 86) from the APS/ ACP review that were not included in the systematic review and 4 additional newer trials (Table Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.244; Appendix Tables E8, F6).87-90 Sample sizes ranged from 36 to 302 subjects. One trial evaluated patients with acute low back pain36 and the others evaluated patients with subacute or chronic low back pain. The opioids evaluated were and codeine. Two trials compared opioids versus placebo, one compared an opioid plus naproxen versus naproxen alone, and one compared opioids versus acetaminophen. Two newer trials compared tramadol plus acetaminophen versus placebo, and one compared long-acting hydrocodone versus placebo. The duration of treatment ranged from 15 days to 16 weeks, with outcomes assessed at the end of treatment. Two of the newer trials were rated good quality, 87, 88 one fair quality,90 and one poor quality.89 Methodological shortcomings in the poor- and fair- quality trials included failure to describe adequate randomization methods, failure to report baseline differences, unblinded design, and high attrition. We also identified a post-hoc analysis of one of the trials included in the systematic review that stratified results according to presence of neuropathic pain. 91 Of the 23 total trials, 8 employed an enriched enrollment and withdrawal design. In this design, all potential subjects receive the study drug for a period of time in a prerandomization, open label phase. Only those who benefit from the drug and tolerate side effects are then randomized to continue the active drug, or have it withdrawn and replaced with a placebo. Thus, every patient entering the trial has already demonstrated benefit from the opioid and been shown to be free of intolerable side effects at the time of randomization. This strategy can help reduce dropout rates following randomization and reduce the number of unresponsive subjects. However, it may also overestimate efficacy, and has been shown to underestimate adverse events. 92 Despite frequent use of the enriched enrollment and withdrawal design, dropout rates from the trials were high. Only 2 trials had a dropout rate of less than 20 percent,86, 90 and most had rates of 30 to 60 percent.70, 72-80, 82, 84, 87, 89 The most common reasons for dropout were discontinuation due to adverse events (more common in the opioid arms than placebo) or lack of effect (more common in the placebo arms). Another limitation of all the trials was short duration. The longest trial was 16 weeks (18).86 Many trials excluded patients with a history of substance abuse or depression, though these were groups that were more likely than others to receive opioids in clinical practice. 93 Seventeen trials were industry sponsored and all involved tramadol, new long-acting preparations of older drugs, or new drug combinations. We also included findings from a good-quality comparative effectiveness review94 of opioids for chronic noncancer pain that included three head-to-head trials of different long-acting opioids for low back pain 85, 95, 96 and five trials of long-acting versus short-acting opioids,86, 97-100 and two other trials that evaluated comparisons among opioids.101, 102 Strong Opioids V ersus Placebo Subacute or Chronic Low Back Pain Seven trials included in the systematic review69 (five rated low risk of bias70, 72, 74-76, 87) compared strong opioids versus placebo70-76, 85, 87 for subacute or chronic back pain. The opioids Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.25evaluated were extended-release tapentadol (1 trial), oxycodone (2 trials), (1 morphine (2 trials), extended release-hydromorphone (1 trial), extended-release oxymorphone (2 trials), and oxycodone with or without naltrexone (1 trial). Strong opioids were associated with greater improvement in pain scores versus placebo (6 trials, SMD 0.43, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.33). 70-72, 74-76 The findings were consistent among trials (I2=0.0%). The clinical magnitude of effects was small, typically equivalent to about 1 point on a 0-10 pain scale. Strong opioids were also associated with greater improvement in function versus placebo (4 trials, SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.15; I2=0.0%). The effect was typically equivalent to about 1 point on the 24-point RDQ. Three trials not included in the meta-analysis that evaluated oxycodone, oxycodone plus naloxone, or extended-release hydrocodone reported results consistent with the findings of the systematic review. 85, 87, 89 Radicular Low Back Pain One trial72 included in the systematic review69 found that effects on pain were similar in patients with neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain in a post-hoc stratified analysis.91 Tramadol V ersus Placebo Subacute or Chronic Low Back Pain Five higher-quality trials of tramadol versus placebo were included in the systematic review.69 Sample sizes ranged from 254 to 386. Two trials evaluated a tramadol/acetaminophen combination77, 78 and two trials evaluated extended-release tramadol.80, 81 Doses were titrated in four trials and the fifth evaluated fixed dosing. Tramadol was associated with greater pain relief versus placebo (5 trials, SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.44, I2=86%). Effects generally averaged the equivalent of 1 point or less on a 0-10 pain scale. Although statistical heterogeneity was present, effects in all trials favored tramadol (standard mean differences ranged from 0.10 to 1.01). Tramadol was also associated with greater improvement in function versus placebo, though the average effect was smaller than for pain (5 trials, SMD 0.18, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.07, I2=0%). Four of the trials measured function using the RDQ, with a typical difference between tramadol and placebo of about 1 point. Two newer trials not included in the systematic review of tramadol plus acetaminophen versus placebo reported results consistent with the findings of the systematic review. 88, 90 Buprenorphine V ersus Placebo Subacute or Chronic Low Back Pain Two trials in the systematic review compared buprenorphine patches (titrated dose) versus placebo patches for subacute or chronic back pain (n=78 and n=541).82, 84 Both reported a statistically significant advantage of buprenorphine for pain, though the effect was smaller than the equivalent of 1 point on a 0-10 pain scale. One reported no significant difference in functional outcome; 82 the other reported that buprenorphine was associated with better functional outcomes, but did not report a p value or other statistical testing. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.26Opioids V ersus NSAIDs Chronic Low Back Pain Three trials in the systematic review compared opioids versus NSAIDs. Two larger trials (n=796 and n=802) of identical design (both rated higher quality) were reported in a single publication.83 They compared a fixed dose of the weak opioid tramadol (50 mg three times daily) versus a fixed dose of celecoxib (200 mg twice daily). The third was a small (n=36), older trial comparing three regimens: (1) Long acting morphine + titrated doses naproxen, and (3) naproxen alone (titrated dose). 86 The two trials of tramadol versus celecoxib reported the percent of patients with a reduction in pain scores of at least 30 percent on a 0-10 rating scale.83 One trial reported a statistically significant but small advantage for celecoxib (66% responders vs. 57% for tramadol). The other trial reported no statistically significant difference (65% responders for celecoxib, 60% for tramadol), though results also favored celecoxib. Functional outcomes were not reported. The small, older trial reported greater average pain relief with both strong opioid regimens than with naproxen, by about 6-10 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale. 86 There were no significant differences in self-reported activity levels. Opioid V ersus Acetaminophen Acute Low Back Pain One small trial of military trainees (n=75) with acute low back pain found no differences between codeine, oxycodone plus aspirin, or acetaminophen in days to return to work (11 vs. 12 vs. 13 days, respectively). 36 Pain scores were not reported. Opioid V ersus Opioid Chronic Low Back Pain A systematic review included three head-to-head trials of long-acting opioids for chronic low back pain.94 In the trials, patients were titrated for effective pain relief in both arms. One trial95 found no differences between oral morphine versus transdermal fentanyl and one trial85 found no differences between long-acting oxymorphone versus long-acting oxycodone in measures of pain relief or function. A third trial found long-acting morphine associated with higher likelihood of experiencing >2-point improvement on the Brief Pain Inventory versus long-acting oxycodone (55% vs. 44%, p=0.03) and greater improvement in sleep quality (mean improvement from baseline 33% vs. 17% on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, p=0.006), but had important methodological shortcomings, including open-label design, high attrition, and failure to report intention-to-treat analysis. 96 One other trial found no differences between extended-release morphine versus controlled-release oxycodone in pain or function.101 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.27Long-Acting V ersus Short-Acting Opioid Chronic Low Back Pain A systematic review included five head-to-head trials of a long-acting versus short-acting opioid for chronic low back pain.94 Three trials found no differences between long-acting versus immediate-release preparations in pain control.97, 98, 100 In two trials, long-acting opioids were more effective than short-acting opioids for pain control, but patients who received long-acting opioids also received higher doses of opioids. One other trial also found long-acting tramadol associated with better pain relief and function than short-acting tramadol, but the dose of tramadol in the long-acting treatment arm was nearly double that of the short-acting arm. 102 Harms The systematic review found short-term use of opioids associated with higher risk versus placebo of nausea, dizziness, constipation, vomiting, somnolence, and dry mouth.69 As noted previously, a number of trials used an enriched enrollment and withdrawal design, which has been shown to underestimate risk of harms. A systematic review of opioids for chronic pain in general (not restricted to low back pain) reported nausea in 28 percent of patients randomized to opioids versus 9 percent randomized to placebo among trials that did not use an enrichment design (difference 17%, 95% CI 13 to 21), 26 versus 7 percent for constipation (difference 20%, 95% CI 15 to 25), 24 versus 7 percent for somnolence/drowsiness (difference 14%, 95% CI 10 to 18), and 15 versus 2 percent for pruritus (difference 10%, 95% CI 5 to 15). 92 In trials that used an enrichment design, rates were 16 versus 8 percent for nausea (difference 7%, 95% CI 0% to 14%), 15 versus 3 percent for constipation (difference 11%, 95% CI 6 to 16), 10 versus 5 percent for somnolence/drowsiness (difference 3%, 95% CI 1 to 7), 10 versus 5 percent for dizziness/vertigo (difference 5%, 95% CI 2 to 8), and 5% versus 2 percent for pruritus (difference 3%, 95% CI 0 to 5). The trials were not designed to assess risks of harms such as abuse and addiction, overdose, fractures, cardiovascular events, sexual dysfunction, and motor vehicle accidents. Although observational studies on risk for such harms in patients prescribed opioids specifically for low back pain is lacking, we recently reviewed evidence on the long-term risks of opioid therapy for chronic pain in general, including risks of abuse and addiction, overdose, fractures, cardiovascular events, sexual dysfunction, and motor vehicle accidents. 15 Evidence from observational studies suggested an increased risk of overdose, as well as abuse and addiction, fractures, motor vehicle accidents, and sexual dysfunction, which appeared to be dose-dependent after adjusting for potential confounders.

For acute low back pain, a systematic review found no difference between a skeletal muscle relaxant plus an NSAID versus the NSAID alone in the likelihood of experiencing pain relief, though the estimate favored combination therapy (2 trials; RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.70; I2=84%); one other trial (n=197) also reported results that favored combination therapy (SOE: low). For chronic low back pain, evidence from three placebo-controlled trials was insufficient to determine effects, due to imprecision and inconsistent results (SOE: insufficient). Three trials in a systematic review found no differences in any outcome among different skeletal muscle relaxants for acute or chronic low back pain (SOE: low). A systematic review found skeletal muscle relaxants for acute low back pain associated with increased risk of any adverse event versus placebo (8 trials; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.98) and increased risk of central nervous system events (primarily sedation) (8 trials; RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.37; I2=50%); one additional placebo-controlled trial was consistent with these findings (SOE: moderate). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included a good-quality systematic review of skeletal muscle relaxants103 with 22 studies.104-125 Twelve trials compared a skeletal muscle relaxant versus placebo,104-107, 109, 112, 114-116, 118, 119, 121 four compared a skeletal muscle relaxant plus an NSAID versus an NSAID alone,110, 113, 123, 125 two compared a skeletal muscle relaxant versus another active treatment,117, 124 and three compared one skeletal muscle relaxant versus another.111, 120, 122 The skeletal muscle relaxants evaluated were tizanidine (4 to 12 mg/day; 7 trials), cyclobenzaprine (30 to 40 mg/day; 4 trials), oral (dose range 100 to 200 mg/day; 3 trials) or intravenous (single 60 mg dose;1 trial) orphenadrine, carisoprodol (1400 mg/day; 2 trials), chlorzoxazone (1500 1 trial), dantrolene (dose not reported; 1 trial), baclofen (30 to 40 mg/day;1 trial), pridinol (8 mg IM, then oral 4 mg/day; 1 trial), tolperisone (300 mg/day; 1 trial) and meprobamate 450 mg/day; 1 trial). Duration of treatment ranged from 4 to 21 days in 21 trials, except for one trial of single dose intravenous orphenadrine. 118 Only three trials followed patients after treatment had been completed.106, 123, 125 Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 405 (median n=80). Eighteen of the trials enrolled patients with acute back pain and four106, 112, 120, 121 enrolled patients with chronic back pain. The review classified 17 trials104, 105, 107-109, 111-114, 116-123, 125 as high quality based on meeting at least 6 of 11 Cochrane Back Review criteria; the other five trials were classified as low quality.106, 110, 115, 120, 124 Methodological shortcomings in most trials included inadequate reporting of randomization and allocation concealment methods; low-quality Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.29trials also did not report attrition, had unbalanced groups at baseline, and/or did not conduct intention-to-treat analyses. The APS/ACP review concluded that there was good evidence for moderate effects of skeletal muscle relaxants versus placebo for acute low back pain, but insufficient (poor) evidence to determine effects for chronic low back pain. We identified two fair-quality trials of skeletal muscle relaxants for acute or subacute back pain published since the APS/ACP review (Table 5; Appendix Tables E7, F7). 126, 127 One trial evaluated carisoprodol 1000 mg/day (250 mg three times daily) versus placebo (n=562)127 and the other (n=197) tizanidine 4 mg/day (2 mg twice daily) plus aceclofenac (an NSAID not available in the United States) 200 mg/day (100 mg twice daily) versus aceclofenac alone. 126 In both studies, duration of treatment was 7 days, with no post-treatment followup. Neither trial provided information regarding methods of randomization or allocation concealment, or methods of blinding of study personnel. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants V ersus Placebo Acute Low Back Pain The systematic review found skeletal muscle relaxants superior to placebo for short-term pain relief (defined as at least a two-point or 30% improvement on a 0-10 V AS pain scale) after 2 to 4 days (4 trials; RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.41; I2=0%) and 5 to 7 days of treatment (3 trials; RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.22; I2=0%.)103 The review also found skeletal muscle relaxants superior to placebo for short-term improvement in global efficacy after 2 to 4 days (4 trials; RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.00), though heterogeneity was very high (I2=89%); the difference was no longer statistically significant after 5 to 7 days (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.44; I2=34%) A more recent fair-quality trial of carisoprodol versus placebo (n=562) was consistent with the systematic review. This trial found carisoprodol associated with greater improvements in patient-rated pain relief at day 3 (mean 1.8 vs. 1.1 on a 0 to 4 scale, p<0.0001) and day 7 (p<0.0001; data not shown.) 127 Patient-rated global improvement was also greater with carisoprodol at day 3 (2.3 vs. 1.7, p<0.0001) and day 7 (p<0.0001, data not provided). Chronic Low Back Pain Evidence on effects of skeletal muscle relaxants versus placebo for chronic back pain is extremely limited. Of three placebo-controlled trials included in the systematic review, one small (n=20), high-quality trial112 found dantrolene associated with better pain-related outcomes versus placebo and one low-quality trial (n=69)106 found no differences between cyclobenzaprine and placebo for pain. A third, high-quality trial (n=112) found no difference between tolperisone versus placebo in global impression of efficacy after 21 days (mean 2.85 versus 2.45 on 1 to 4 scale). 121 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.30Skeletal Muscle Relaxants Plus Another Intervention V ersus the Other Intervention Without Skeletal Muscle Relaxants Acute Low Back Pain The systematic review found no difference between a skeletal muscle relaxant plus an NSAID versus the NSAID alone in the likelihood of experiencing a 2-point or greater difference or 30 percent improvement on a 0-10 V AS after 2 to 4 days (2 trials; RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.70; I2=84%), though the estimate favored the combination. The combination was associated with greater likelihood of experiencing global improvement at 2 to 4 days (4 trials; RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.00; I2=89%); the estimate was not as strong and no longer statistically significant at 5 to 7 days (4 trials; RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.44; I2=34%).103 One fair-quality (n=197) trial not included in the systematic review compared tizanidine plus aceclofenac with aceclofenac alone.126 The combination was associated with greater improvement in resting pain after 3 days (mean change 3.01 vs. 1.90 on 0 to 10 V AS, p=0.0001) and 7 days (5.88 vs. 4.35, p=0.0001).126Results for pain with movement were similar (mean change 2.94 vs. 1.81 at day 3, p=0.0001 and 6.09 vs. 3.98 at day 7, p=0.0001.) The combination was also associated with higher likelihood of experiencing a good or excellent treatment response (75% vs. 34%; RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.52.) Skeletal Muscle Relaxants V ersus Other Interventions Three trials106, 128, 129 of skeletal muscle relaxants versus benzodiazepines are discussed in the benzodiazepine section of this report. Effectiveness of One Skeletal Muscle Relaxant V ersus Another Skeletal Muscle Relaxant Three trials in the systematic review103 found no differences in any outcome between carisoprodol versus cyclobenzaprine (1 trial [n=78]), 122 or tizanidine versus chlorzoxazone (1 trial [n=27]),111 for acute back pain or pridinol versus thiocolchicoside (1 trial [n=120]) for chronic back pain.120 Harms For acute low back pain, the systematic review found skeletal muscle relaxants associated with increased risk of any adverse event versus placebo (8 trials; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.98; I2=50%). 103 There were no differences in risk of any adverse event between skeletal muscle relaxants plus an NSAID versus the NSAID alone (2 trials RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.75; I2=84%). Skeletal muscle relaxants were associated with increased risk of central nervous system events (primarily sedation) versus placebo (8 trials; RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.37; I2=50%), or when added to an NSAID (3 trials; RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.18 to 6.46; I2=51%). Skeletal muscle relaxants were not associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal events versus placebo (7 trials; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.29 to 3.19; I2=50%) an NSAID 0.48, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.00; I2=50%).103 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.31One trial published subsequent to the systematic review found no significant difference between tizanidine plus aceclofenac versus aceclofenac alone in risk of central nervous system events (drowsiness) (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.29).126 One other trial found carisoprodol associated with increased risk of sedation (RR 2.92, 95% CI 1.59 to 5.37) and dizziness (RR 3.08, 95% CI 1.47 to 6.42) versus placebo, though there was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. 127 No serious adverse events were reported in either study.126, 127 Two trials of skeletal muscle relaxants for chronic low back pain found no increase in risk of experiencing any adverse event versus placebo (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.57; I2=0%).103 Other harms were not reported. Benzodiazepines Key Points For acute low back pain, there was insufficient evidence from two trials with inconsistentresults to determine effectiveness of benzodiazepines versus placebo (SOE: insufficient). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review included two trials that found tetrazepamassociated with lower likelihood of no improvement in pain at 5-7 days (RR 0.82, 95%CI 0.72 to 0.94) and at 10 to 14 days (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.93) versus placebo, andlower likelihood of no overall improvement at 10 to 14 days (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to0.97) (SOE: low). For acute or subacute radicular pain, one trial found no difference between diazepam 5mg twice daily for 5 days versus placebo in function at 1 week through 1 year, or otheroutcomes including analgesic use, return to work, or likelihood of surgery through 1year of followup. Diazepam was associated with lower likelihood of experiencing 50%improvement in pain at 1 week (41% vs. 79%, RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8) (SOE: low). For acute low back pain, there was insufficient evidence from two trials with inconsistentresults to determine effects of benzodiazepines versus skeletal muscle relaxants (SOE:insufficient). For chronic low back pain, one trial found no difference between diazepam versuscyclobenzaprine in outcomes related to muscle spasm (SOE: low). A systematic review found central nervous system adverse events such as somnolence,fatigue, and lightheadedness were reported more frequently with benzodiazepines versusplacebo, though harms were not reported well; no trial was designed to evaluated risks withlong-term use of benzodiazepines such as addiction, abuse, or overdose (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included a systematic review of skeletal muscle relaxants for low back pain103 that included eight trials of benzodiazepines.106, 128-134 The sample size was 152 in one trial;133 and ranged from 30 to 80 in the other trials. Four trials compared a benzodiazepine versus placebo,106, 130-132 one trial compared a benzodiazepine plus physical therapy versus placebo plus physical therapy,133 and three trials compared a benzodiazepine versus a skeletal muscle relaxant Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.32(carisoprodol,128 cyclobenzaprine,106 or tizanidine129). One other trial evaluated a benzodiazepine versus drugs that are not available in the United States.134 Four trials in the systematic review evaluated benzodiazepines for acute low back pain128, 129, 131, 132 and three for chronic low back pain.106, 130, 133 Two trials specifically enrolled patients with muscle spasms.106, 129 No trial focused on patients with radiculopathy; in one trial the proportion of patients with radiculopathy was 40 percent.131 Five trials evaluated diazepam106, 128, 129, 131, 132 and two trials evaluated tetrazepam (not available in the United States).130, 133 Diazepam was administered orally at doses of 5 to 10 mg three or four times daily in three trials;106, 128, 129 two trials evaluated regimens that included initial intramuscular diazepam and oral doses.131, 132 In both trials of tetrazepam, the dose was 50 mg by mouth three times daily.130, 133 The duration of therapy ranged from 6 to 14 days; two trials106, 130 evaluated patients 4 days after the completion of therapy and the others evaluated patients at the end of therapy. The review classified five trials as high quality 128-131, 133 based on meeting at least 6 of 11 Cochrane Back Review group criteria; the other two trials were classified as low quality.106, 132 All trials used a blinded design. Methodological shortcomings included inadequate reporting of randomization and allocation concealment methods; some trials also did not report attrition or intention-to-treat analyses. The APS/ACP review concluded that there was fair evidence of a moderate effect of benzodiazepines for acute and chronic low back pain, based in part on evidence from populations with mixed back and neck pain, but noted that there were no reliable data on the risk of abuse of addiction. We identified one good-quality trial (n=60) published since the APS/ACP review of diazepam 5 mg three times daily for 5 days versus placebo for acute radiculopathy due to prolapse lumbar disc (with computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging confirmation) (Table 6; Appendix Tables E8, F8). 135 Outcomes were evaluated through 1 year. Benzodiazepines V ersus Placebo Acute Low Back Pain For acute nonradicular low back pain, one high-quality trial (n=50)131 included in the APS/ ACP review found no differences between diazepam and placebo in likelihood of improved pain and tenderness at the end of 5 days of treatment (76% vs. 72%, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.47), but a low-quality trial (n=68) 132 found diazepam superior to placebo for likelihood of experiencing good or very good benefit at the end of 10 days of treatment (57% vs. 17%, RR 3.31, 95% CI 1.52 to 7.23). Chronic Low Back Pain For chronic nonradicular low back pain, pooled results from two high-quality trials (n=50 and 152) 130, 133 included in the APS/ACP review found tetrazepam associated with lower likelihood of no improvement in pain at 5-7 days (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94) and at 10 to 14 days (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.93) versus placebo, and lower likelihood of no overall improvement at 10 to 14 days (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.97). In one trial, all patients also underwent physical therapy.133 One low-quality trial (n=76) found no difference between diazepam versus placebo in outcomes related to muscle spasm.106 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.33Radicular Low Back Pain For acute or subacute radicular pain due to herniated disc, one good-quality trial (n=60) published subsequent to the APS/ACP review found no difference between oral diazepam 5 mg twice daily for 5 days versus placebo in improvement in the RDQ (median improvement 3.0 vs. 5.0 at 1 week, p=0.67; median RDQ 2 vs. 1 at 1 year), request for additional analgesics, likelihood of improvement in neurological deficits, return to work, or likelihood of undergoing surgery through 1 year of followup. 135 Diazepam was associated with lower likelihood of experiencing 50% improvement in pain at 1 week (41% vs. 79%, RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8) Benzodiazepines V ersus Skeletal Muscle Relaxants Acute Low Back Pain Two high-quality trials included in the APS/ACP review evaluated diazepam versus skeletal muscle relaxants for acute low back pain.128, 129 One trial (n=30) found no differences between diazepam versus tizanidine in measures of pain relief or daily activities.129 The other trial found diazepam inferior to carisoprodol for likelihood of overall improvement (45% vs. 70%, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.96) and measures of activity, sleep impairment, and overall relief at the end of a 7-day course of treatment (differences on continuous measures ranged from 12 to 19 points on a 100-point scale). 128 Chronic Low Back Pain For chronic low back pain, one trial included in the APS/ACP review found no difference between diazepam versus cyclobenzaprine in outcomes related to muscle spasm.106 Harms In the trials of benzodiazepines included in the APS/ACP review, central nervous system adverse events such as somnolence, fatigue, and lightheadedness were reported more frequently with benzodiazepines versus placebo, though harms were not reported well. 103 No trial was designed to evaluate risks with long-term use of benzodiazepines such as addiction, abuse, or overdose. Harms were not reported in one short-term trial of diazepam versus placebo published subsequent to the APS/ACP review. 135 Antidepressants Key Points For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found no differences in pain betweentricyclic antidepressants versus placebo (4 trials; SMD 0.10, 95% 95% CI 0.17 to 0.39; I2=0%);there was also no difference between antidepressants versus placebo in function (2 trials,SMD 0.06, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.29; I2=0%) (SOE: moderate for pain, low for function). For chronic pain, three trials, found duloxetine associated with lower pain intensity(differences 0.58 to 0.74 on a 0 to 10 scale) and better function (differences 0.58 to 0.74 on Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.34the Brief Pain Inventory-Interference scale) versus placebo (SOE: moderate for pain and function). No study evaluated the effectiveness of antidepressants specifically for radicular low backpain. No study compared duloxetine versus a tricyclic antidepressant. Antidepressants were associated with higher risk of any adverse events compared withplacebo, with no difference in risk of serious adverse events (SOE: moderate). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included three higher-quality systematic reviews136-138 of antidepressants for low back pain. The reviews included a total of 10 unique trials (8 placebo controlled). Based on the systematic reviews, the APS/ACP review 29 concluded that that tricyclic antidepressants were slightly more effective than placebo for pain relief for chronic back pain, with no significant effects on function. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of antidepressants for acute low back pain. We identified a good-quality systematic review 139 on antidepressants for low back pain published subsequent to the APS/ACP review (Table 1; Appendix Tables E9, F9). The review included 10 trials (n=16 to 121); 140-149 seven of the trials were included in one or more of the older systematic reviews.140, 142-145, 147, 148 Only two trials required patients to have depression in addition to low back pain;144, 148 the other trials excluded patients with depression,141-143, 146 patients with depression accounted for a minority of enrollees,140, 145, 149 or depression status was not reported.147 One trial 149 evaluated injectable clomipramine, an intervention which is not widely used and outside the scope of this review. All studies included a placebo arm, though three used an active placebo (either diphenhydramine, 142 benztropine,141 or atropine148) meant to mimic the side effects of antidepressants without therapeutic effects on pain. One trial also compared a tetracyclic antidepressant (maprotiline) versus an SSRI (paroxetine).142 Duration of followup in the trials ranged from 10 days to 12 weeks. Nine of the trials enrolled participants with chronic pain; duration of pain was not reported in the other trial. 140 Seven trials were assessed as high quality based on meeting at least 6 Cochrane Back Review Group criteria. Methodological limitations in the three lower-quality trials included inadequate description of randomization and allocation concealment methods and high rates of attrition. 139 We identified five additional trials (n=60 to 404) not included in the prior systematic reviews of antidepressants for chronic low back pain (Table 7; Appendix Tables F10).150-154 one escitalopram,151 and one trial amitriptyline versus bupropion.150 One trial was rated good quality,152 three trials fair quality,151, 153, 154 and one trial poor quality.150 Methodological shortcomings in the poor- and fair-quality trials included inadequate description of randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding methods. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.35Antidepressants V ersus Placebo Chronic Low Back Pain The systematic review found no difference between antidepressants versus placebo on pain for chronic low back pain (9 trials, SMD 0.04, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.17; I2=0%), with a point estimate close to 0 (no effect).139 In stratified analyses, there were also no differences between antidepressants versus placebo for tricyclic antidepressants 0.39; I2=0%). The review also found that antidepressants were not associated with reduced depression (SMD 0.06, 95% 0.40 to 0.29; I2=0%), but each of these outcomes was only evaluated in two trials. One good-quality 152 and two fair-quality153, 154 trials evaluated duloxetine versus placebo for chronic low back pain and were not included in the systematic review. In all three trials, duloxetine 60 mg daily was associated with better scores based on the Brief Pain Inventory-Severity Scale (differences 0.60 to 0.79 points on a 0 to 10 scale) after 12 to 13 weeks followup. Results were similar, but not statistically significant, for duloxetine 20 or 120 mg/day doses versus placebo. 152 One of the trials also found 60 mg duloxetine associated with a greater likelihood of at least 50 percent improvement in pain score after 12 weeks (49% vs. 35%; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.78). 153 All three trials found duloxetine 60 mg daily associated with greater improvement in function versus placebo on the Brief Pain Inventory-Interference scale (mean between-group difference 0.58 to 0.74), but there were no differences on the RDQ (reported in one study; mean change from baseline 2.69 vs. 2.22; p=0.26). 153 The good-quality trial found both 60 and 120 mg daily doses of duloxetine associated with greater global improvement versus placebo (mean change 0.94 vs. 1.06 vs. 0.53; p<0.05 for both comparisons), measured using the Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S) scale, although absolute differences between the groups were small (about 0.5 point on an 0- to 7-point scale). 152 Two other fair-quality trials found no differences between duloxetine and placebo in mean change in CGI-S scores.153, 154 There were also few differences between duloxetine and placebo in quality-of-life outcomes, although one study found significant improvements in insomnia scores with duloxetine (mean change from baseline 1.92 versus 1.18 on the 0 to 24 Athens Insomnia Scale; p0.01). 154 Antidepressants Plus Another Intervention V ersus the Other Intervention Without Antidepressants No study evaluated an antidepressant plus another intervention versus the other intervention alone. Antidepressants V ersus Other Interventions One trial37 included in the APS/ACP review29 of acetaminophen versus amitriptyline is discussed in the acetaminophen section of this report. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.36Effectiveness of One Antidepressant V ersus Another Antidepressant Chronic Low Back Pain Two trials included in prior reviews compared the effects of different antidepressants for chronic low back pain. One trial (n=108) found a tetracyclic antidepressant (maprotiline) superior to an SSRI (paroxetine) for pain relief after 8 weeks using the Descriptor Differential Scale (5.41 vs. 2.34 on a 0 to 20 scale; p=0.013). 142 A smaller (n=40), lower-quality trial found no difference between a tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline) versus an SSRI (fluoxetine) in the likelihood of experiencing at least moderate pain relief after 6 weeks (82% [14/17] vs. 78% [14/18]; RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.47.) 155 We identified one fair-quality study (n=85) not included in prior systematic reviews that compared the effects of different antidepressants for low back pain.151, 152 It found no differences between duloxetine versus an SSRI (escitalopram) in pain, function, or quality of life. A third, poor-quality study (n=60) found no differences between a tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline) versus bupropion in pain after 8 weeks of use. 150 Harms The APS/ACP review29 found antidepressant use associated with a higher risk for any adverse event compared with placebo (22% vs. 14%; RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.55) based on an older systematic review. 137 However, there were no differences between antidepressants versus placebo in rates of specific adverse events, including drowsiness (p=0.61), dizziness (p=0.84), dry mouth (p=0.55), constipation (p=0.28), or sexual dysfunction (p=0.23). The trials were not designed to assess for risk of serious adverse events. Three recent trials found no differences between duloxetine versus placebo in risk of serious adverse events, with no deaths reported. 152-154 Duloxetine was associated with increased risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (3 trials, duloxetine any dose vs. placebo [OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.74 to 4.24; I2=0%]; duloxetine 60 1.58 to 4.03; I2=0%]). Duloxetine was also associated with increased risk of nausea (p<0.05), but there was no clear increase in risk of other specific adverse events. Trials of escitalopram versus duloxetine 151 or amitriptyline versus bupropion150 found no differences in risk of adverse events. Antiseizure Medications Key Points No trial evaluated antiseizure medications for acute nonradicular low back pain. One trial found no difference between gabapentin (up to 3600 mg/day) versus placebo forchronic nonradicular low back pain, but did not meet inclusion criteria because it was onlypublished as an abstract (SOE: insufficient). For chronic radicular low back pain, there was insufficient evidence from three poor-quality trials with inconsistent findings to determine effects of gabapentin versus placebo(SOE: insufficient). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.37 For chronic radicular low back pain or mixed radicular and nonradicular low back pain, two trials reported inconsistent results for effects of topiramate versus placebo (SOE: insufficient). For chronic radicular low back pain, two trials reported inconsistent effects of pregabalin versus placebo for pain or function (SOE: insufficient). For chronic radicular or nonradicular low back pain, there was insufficient evidence from one poor-quality trial to determine effects of pregabalin versus amitriptyline (SOE: insufficient). For chronic nonradicular low back pain, one small trial found the addition of pregabalin 300 mg/day to transdermal fentanyl associated with substantially lower pain scores than transdermal buprenorphine alone at 3 weeks (difference ~26 points on a 0 to 100 scale, p<0.05) but the estimate was very imprecise (SOE: insufficient). For chronic radicular pain, one trial found pregabalin (mean 2.1 mg/kg/day) plus celecoxib associated with lower pain scores than celecoxib alone (difference 11 points on a 0-100 scale, p=0.001) after 4 weeks and one trial found no effects of adding pregabalin (titrated to 300 mg/day) to tapentadol PR versus tapentadol PR alone on pain or the SF-12 after 8 weeks (SOE: insufficient). Two trials of gabapentin versus placebo reported no clear differences in risk of adverse events (SOE: low). Two trials of topiramate versus placebo reported inconsistent effects on risk of withdrawal due to adverse events; one of the trials found topiramate associated with higher risk of sedation and diarrhea (SOE: insufficient). Two trials of pregabalin versus placebo reported inconsistent effects on risk of withdrawal due to adverse events, somnolence, and dizziness; one of the trials used an enrichment/withdrawal design (SOE: insufficient). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included four trials of antiseizure medications for low back pain.156-159 Two trials (n=50 and 65)157, 159 evaluated gabapentin and two trials (n=29 and 96)156, 158 evaluated topiramate. All trials compared antiseizure medications versus placebo, with one trial156 utilizing an \"active\" placebo (diphenhydramine). Three trials156, 157, 159 evaluated patients with radicular symptoms and one trial (of topiramate)158 evaluated a mixed population of patients with radicular or nonradicular pain. We identified seven trials of antiseizure medications for low back pain published subsequent to the APS/ACP review (Table 8; Appendix Tables E11, F11).160-166 Sample sizes were 200 to 309 in the three largest trials160-162 and ranged from 26 to 55 in the other four trials. Six trials160-165 evaluated pregabalin and one trial166 evaluated gabapentin. Two trials compared pregabalin versus placebo 160 or active placebo (diphenhydramine)163 and one trial166 compared gabapentin versus no gabapentin. Three trials compared pregabalin plus another medication (tapentadol,161 transdermal buprenorphine,164 or celecoxib165) versus the other medication without pregabalin Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.38and one trial162 compared pregabalin versus amitriptyline. The celecoxib trial also compared pregabalin alone versus celecoxib alone.165 Five trials evaluated patients with radicular symptoms,160, 161, 163, 165, 166 with two trials163, 166 focusing on patients with spinal stenosis. One trial was restricted to patients with nonradicular back pain164 and one trial enrolled a mixed population of radicular and nonradicular back pain.162 All of the trials, including those in the APS/ACP review, evaluated patients with chronic symptoms. Dosing of antiseizure medications varied. One trial evaluated fixed-dose pregabalin 300 mg/day in combination with transdermal buprenorphine.164 In the other pregabalin trials, doses were titrated, though titration protocols and maximum doses varied. Two trials156, 158 of topiramate titrated doses to 300 or 400 mg/day and three trials titrated gabapentin to a maximum dose that ranged from 1200 to 3600 mg/day. 157, 159, 166 The duration of therapy ranged from 2 weeks to 4 months; outcomes were assessed at the end of or during therapy in all trials except for one, 161 which evaluated patients 1-2 weeks after completing 8 weeks of therapy. Three trials156, 163, 165 used a crossover design and the rest were parallel-group trials. Six trials158, 160, 161, 163-165 were rated fair quality and four156, 157, 159, 166 poor quality. Methodological shortcomings included inadequate description of randomization and allocation concealment methods and unclear blinding of outcome assessors. Additional shortcomings in the poor-quality trials included unblinded design or unclear blinding status, high attrition, and failure to perform intention-to-treat analysis. One trial of pregabalin used an enrichment/withdrawal design. 160 None of the crossover trials reported results of the first intervention period and two of the crossover trials 163, 165 did not assess for carryover effects, though all employed a washout period between interventions. We excluded one trial (n=113) of gabapentin (up to 3600 mg/day) versus placebo for chronic nonradicular pain only published as an abstract.167 Antiseizure Medications V ersus Placebo Acute Low Back Pain No trial evaluated antiseizure medications for acute nonradicular low back pain. Chronic Low Back Pain One trial ( n=113) of gabapentin (titrated up to 3600 mg/day) versus placebo for nonradicular low back pain was excluded because it has only been published as an abstract, but otherwise met inclusion criteria. 167 It found no differences between gabapentin versus placebo in outcomes related to pain, function, or quality of life. Radicular Low Back Pain Two poor-quality trials included in the APS/ACP review evaluated gabapentin versus placebo for chronic radicular back pain.157, 159 One trial (n=80) found no clear differences between gabapentin (titrated up to 1200 mg/day) versus placebo in back pain at rest, back pain with movement, or leg pain (mean differences ~0.3 to 0.5 points on a 0 to 10 scale, p for between-group differences not reported). 157 The other trial (n=50), which used higher doses of gabapentin Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.39(titrated up to 3600 mg/day) found gabapentin associated with greater improvement in back pain at rest versus placebo (mean change from baseline 1.04 vs. 0.32 on a 0 to 3 scale, p<0.01).159 One subsequent poor-quality trial (n=55) of patients with chronic radicular symptoms due to spinal stenosis found gabapentin (titrated up to 2400 mg/day) associated with lower pain scores at 4 months (2.8 vs. 4.7 on 0 to 10 scale, p=0.006), increased likelihood of being able to walk >1000 m (65% vs. 21% at 4 months, p=0.001), and decreased likelihood of sensory deficit (32% vs. 63%). 166 However, it was unclear if patients were blinded and attrition was not reported. Two trials included in the APS/ACP review evaluated topiramate (titrated up to 300 or 400 mg/day) versus placebo or active placebo.156, 158 For chronic radicular or nonradicular pain, a fair-quality trial (n=96) found topiramate moderately more effective than placebo for improving Pain Rating Index scores (about 11 points on a 0 to 100 scale, p<0.001). 158 Topiramate was also more effective than placebo for improving scores on all SF-36 subscales. The largest difference was on the physical function subscale (9.1 points, range 0.6 to 8.3 points for other subscales). For chronic radicular pain, a poor-quality trial (n=41) 156 found topiramate more effective than diphenhydramine for improving back and overall pain, though mean differences were small (less than one point on a 0 to 10 scale). There were no statistically significant differences in leg pain, ODI scores, or SF-36 scores. Topiramate was also associated with a higher likelihood of patients reporting moderate to complete pain relief (54% vs. 24%, p=0.005). Two fair-quality trials published subsequent to the APS/ACP review evaluated pregabalin versus placebo. One trial (n=211) that used an enrichment/withdrawal design found no differences between pregabalin (mean dose 410 mg/day) versus placebo in pain (mean change from baseline 0.16 vs. 0.05 on a 0-10 scale, p=0.33), the EQ-5D, or the RDQ. 160 Pregabalin was superior for outcomes related to sleep and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), but effects were small (difference in sleep quality less than 0.5 hours, and differences in HADS anxiety and depression scores ~1 point on a 0 to 21 scale). The other, smaller (n=26) trial, which evaluated patients with neurogenic claudication due to spinal stenosis, found no differences between pregabalin (titrated to 150 mg twice daily) versus an active placebo (diphenhydramine) in the ODI, pain with ambulation, walking distance, or the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire after 10 days. 163 Pregabalin was associated with slightly worse mean RDQ at 2 weeks (13 vs. 11, p=0.01). Antiseizure Medications V ersus Another Medication Radicular Low Back Pain For chronic radicular pain, one fair-quality trial (n=36) found no differences between pregabalin (mean 2.1 mg/kg/day) versus celecoxib (mean 4.2 mg/kg/day) in pain scores after 4 weeks (mean 43 vs. 40 on a 0-100 scale). 165 Mixed (Radicular or Nonradicular) Low Back Pain For chronic radicular or nonradicular low back pain, one poor-quality trial (n=200) found no clear differences between pregabalin (mean dose ~430 mg/day) versus amitriptyline (mean dose 38 mg/day) in mean pain (3.8 vs. 2.8 on 0 to 10 V AS, p>0.05) or function scores (22 vs. 17 on the ODI, p>0.05) through 14 weeks, though pregabalin was associated with greater likelihood of Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.4050% improvement in pain score (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.92) or >20% improvement in ODI (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.97).162 Antiseizure Medications Plus Another Medication V ersus the Other Medication Alone Chronic Low Back Pain For chronic nonradicular low back pain, one fair-quality trial (n=44) found the addition of pregabalin 300 mg/day to transdermal buprenorphine associated with substantially lower pain scores versus transdermal buprenorphine alone at 3 weeks (difference ~26 points on a 0 to 100 scale, p<0.05). 164 Radicular Low Back Pain For chronic radicular pain, one trial (n=36) found pregabalin (mean 2.1 mg/kg/day) plus celecoxib associated with lower pain scores versus celecoxib alone (difference 11 points on a 0-100 scale, p=0.001) after 4 weeks 165 and one trial (n=309) found no effects of adding pregabalin (titrated to 300 mg/day) to tapentadol PR versus tapentadol PR alone on pain, the SF-12, the EQ-5D, or HADS anxiety or depression scores 1 to 2 weeks after an 8-week course of therapy. 161 Both trials were rated fair quality. Harms Two trials of gabapentin versus placebo evaluated harms. In one trial, withdrawal due to adverse events occurred in 2 of 25 patients randomized to gabapentin versus none of 25 randomized to placebo. 159 In the other trial, no withdrawals due to adverse events occurred, though drowsiness (6%), loss of energy (6%), and dizziness (6%) were reported with gabapentin. 157 One subsequent trial of gabapentin versus placebo also reported no withdrawals, though ataxia (7%) was reported with gabapentin.166 Harms were reported in two trials of topiramate versus placebo.156, 158 One trial found topiramate associated with higher likelihood of withdrawal due to adverse events versus diphenhydramine (33% vs. 15%), 156 but there was no difference between topiramate versus placebo in rates of withdrawal due to adverse events in the other (4% vs. 4%).158 Topiramate was also associated with higher rates of withdrawal due to adverse events (33% vs. 15%), sedation (34% vs. 3%) and diarrhea (30% vs. 10%) compared with diphenhydramine in one trial. 156 Two trials published reported harms associated with pregabalin versus placebo.160, 163 One trial163 found pregabalin associated with greater risk of any adverse event versus diphenhydramine (active placebo) (64% vs. 35%), though the other trial160 found no difference versus inert placebo (41% vs. 42%). Serious adverse events were rare (2 events in one trial and none in the other). The trials also reported inconsistent results for somnolence and dizziness, with one trial 163 reporting increased risk and the other160 no difference. In the trial that reported no differences, patients randomized to placebo were withdrawn from pregabalin after being stabilized on it (enrichment/withdrawal design). 160 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.41Three trials of pregabalin plus another drug (transdermal buprenorphine, celecoxib, or tapentadol PR) versus the other drug alone found no differences in risk of withdrawal due to adverse events or other side effects, though estimates were imprecise due to small samples.161, 164, 165 Corticosteroids Key Points For acute nonradicular low back pain, two trials found no differences between a singleintramuscular injection or a 5-day course of systemic corticosteroids versus placebo forpain or function (SOE: low for pain and function). For radicular low back pain (acute or unspecified duration) five trials consistently foundno differences between systemic corticosteroids (administered a single bolus or as ashort taper) versus placebo in pain or function; one trial found no effect on need for spinesurgery (SOE: moderate for pain and function). For spinal stenosis, one trial found no differences through 12 weeks of followup betweena 3-week course of prednisone versus placebo in pain intensity, the RDQ, or any SF-36subscale (SOE: low for pain and function). Trials of systemic corticosteroids did not report serious adverse events, includinghyperglycemia requiring medical treatment, but adverse events were not reported well insome trials (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included four trials of systemic corticosteroids.168-171 Three trials (n=49 to 60)168, 170, 171 evaluated systemic corticosteroids in patients with radiculopathy and one trial (n=86)169 evaluated patients with nonradicular back pain. For radiculopathy, the APS/ACP review concluded that there was consistent evidence that systemic corticosteroids were not associated with clinically significant benefits when given as a single large parenteral bolus or as a short oral or intramuscular taper. We identified four trials 172-175 of systemic corticosteroids published subsequent to the APS/ ACP review and one older trial176 that was not included in the APS/ACP review (Table 9; Appendix Tables E12, F12). Three trials (n=27 to 78)173, 174, 176 evaluated patients with radicular pain, one trial (n=61) evaluated patients with spinal stenosis175 and one trial (n=67)172 evaluated patients with nonradicular pain. All of the trials were placebo-controlled. Five trials168, 169, 172-174 evaluated patients with acute low back pain (including the two trials of nonradicular back pain)169, 172 and the other four170, 171, 175, 176 did not specify the duration of symptoms. Three trials were conducted in emergency department settings,169, 172, 173 one trial in an inpatient setting,168 and in the other trials the clinical setting was not reported or mixed. The doses and mode of administration of corticosteroids varied. Three trials evaluated a single dose of parenteral (intravenous or intramuscular) methylprednisolone (150 to 500 mg, equivalent to 187.5 to 625 mg of prednisone). 168, 169, 173 In Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.42the other trials, the duration of treatment ranged from 5 to 21 days. Three trials evaluated similar tapering courses of oral or intramuscular dexamethasone (64 mg for 1 day, 32 mg for 1 day, 24 mg for 1 day, 12 mg for 1 day, and 8 mg for 3 days [64 mg of dexamethasone equivalent to 400 mg of prednisone]). 170, 171, 176 The other three trials evaluated different courses of oral prednisone (50 mg for 5 days,172 60 mg for 3 days, 40 mg for 3 days, and 20 mg for 3 days,174 or 1 mg/kg/day for 1 week, with a one-third dose reduction each week175). The three single-dose trials evaluated patients at 10 days to 1 month after administration; in the other trials followup ranged from within 2 days after a 5 or 7 day course of therapy 171, 172 to 1 to 4 years after a 1-week course of therapy.170 Among the trials of systemic corticosteroids for radiculopathy, two trials173, 174 required a positive straight leg raise for inclusion and four others168, 170, 171, 176 required a positive straight leg raise or other signs of radiculopathy (e.g., sensory, motor, or reflex deficit). One of the latter trials also required imaging findings of a herniated disc that correlated with radicular symptoms.168 The trial of patients with spinal stenosis required presence of neurogenic claudication symptoms and imaging findings of central stenosis. 175 Three trials168, 169, 173 were rated good quality, five trials fair quality,170-172, 175, 176 and one trial poor quality.174 Methodological shortcomings in the fair-quality trials included inadequate description of allocation concealment, unclear blinding of outcomes assessors, and unclear compliance to interventions. The poor-quality trial allocated patients sequentially. 174 One trial (n=100) of dexamethasone versus placebo for nonradicular low back pain was excluded because it was published in German, but otherwise met inclusion criteria.177 Systemic Corticosteroids V ersus Placebo Acute Low Back Pain Two trials evaluated the effects of systemic corticosteroids versus placebo for acute nonradicular low back pain.169, 172 The APS/ACP review included one good-quality trial (n=86) that found no differences between a single intramuscular injection of 160 mg daily methylprednisolone versus placebo in pain relief or improvement in the RDQ at 1 week or 1 month. 169 A subsequent trial (n=67) also found no difference between a 5-day course of oral prednisone 50 mg daily versus placebo in measures of pain, days of work lost, or likelihood of seeking care at 5-7 days, though estimates favored the placebo group. 172 One other trial (n=100) was excluded because it was published in German, but also found no effects of dexamethasone versus placebo for nonradicular pain.177 Radicular Low Back Pain For radiculopathy, three trials included in the APS/ACP review found no differences between systemic corticosteroids (administered as a single large parenteral bolus or as a short oral or intramuscular taper) versus placebo. 168, 170, 171 One good-quality trial (n=60), which was also the only trial to require imaging correlation of radicular symptoms, found a single large bolus of methylprednisolone associated with small (average 6 mm on a 0-100 scale) early improvement in leg pain versus placebo, but the benefits was no longer present after the first 3 days. 168 There were Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.43no differences in the degree of pain relief, functional disability, the proportion requiring spine surgery within the first month, or medication use. In two fair-quality trials (n=33 and 49), 7-day tapering courses of either oral or intramuscular dexamethasone (initial dose 64 mg/day) were not associated with differences in overall effect or likelihood of subsequent surgery, either at the end of treatment or after 1 to 4 years of followup. 170, 171 Two subsequent trials of patients with acute radicular low back pain also found no differences between systemic corticosteroids versus placebo in improvement in pain, the RDQ, return to work, use of medications, or the likelihood of seeking additional health care. 173, 174 A good- quality trial (n=78)173 evaluated outcomes through 1 month after a single dose of intramuscular methylprednisolone 160 mg and one poor-quality trial (n=27)174 evaluated outcomes through 6 months after a tapering course of prednisone (initial dose 60 mg/day. One other older, fair-quality trial (n=39) that was not included in the APS/ACP review also found no difference between a tapering course of intramuscular dexamethasone (initial dose 64 mg/day) versus placebo in likelihood of experiencing \"clear improvement\" through 3 months. 176 Spinal Stenosis For spinal stenosis, one trial not included in the APS/ACP review found no differences through 12 weeks of followup between a 3-week course of prednisone versus placebo in pain intensity, the RDQ, or any SF-36 subscale. 175 Harms One trial reported two cases of transient hyperglycemia and one case of facial flushing following administration of a large (500 mg) intravenous methylprednisolone bolus.168 In two trials, a smaller (160 mg) intramuscular methylprednisolone injection was associated with no cases of hyperglycemia requiring medical attention, infection, or gastrointestinal bleeding. 169, 173 One other older trial not included in the APS/ACP review found a tapering course of intramuscular dexamethasone (initial dose 64 mg/day) associated with increased risk of any side effect (32% vs. 5.0%, RR 6.32, 95% CI 0.84 to 47.7), but no patients in either group withdrew due to adverse events. 176 Adverse events were not reported well in the other trials of systemic corticosteroids. Topical Medications No study evaluated topical capsaicin or lidocaine for low back pain. Key Question 2. What are the comparative benefits and harms of different nonpharmacological noninvasive therapies for acute or chronic nonradicular low back pain, radicular low back pain, or spinal stenosis? Includes but is not limited to multidisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise (various types), physical modalities (ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, electrical muscle stimulation, interferential therapy , heat [various forms], and ice), traction tables/devices, back supports/bracing, spinal manipulation, various psychological therapies, acupuncture, massage therapy (various types), yoga, magnets, and low-level lasers.

For subacutelow back pain, there were also no differences in pain (5 trials, WMD 1.89 on a 100-pointscale, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.91) or function (4 trials, WMD 1.07, 95% CI 3.18 to 5.32).Three subsequent trials for acute to subacute low back pain reported inconsistent effects ofexercise versus usual care on pain and function (SOE: low for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found exercise associated with greater painrelief versus no exercise (19 trials, WMD 10 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 1.31 to 19.09),though the effect on function was small and not statistically significant (17 trials, WMD3.00 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 0.53 to 6.48). Results from a more recent systematicreview using more restrictive criteria and additional trials not included in the systematicreviews were generally consistent with these findings (SOE: moderate for pain andfunction). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review included two trials that found motor controlexercise (MCE) associated with lower pain scores in the short term (WMD 12.48 on a 0to 100 scale, 95% CI19.04 term (WMD 10.18, 95% CI 16.64to 3.72) and at long term (WMD 13.32 95% CI 19.75 to 6.90) versus a minimalintervention. MCE was also associated with better function at short term (3 trials WMD9.00 on 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 15.28 to 2.73), intermediate term (2 trials WMD 5.62,95% CI10.46 to 0.77) and long term (2 trials, WMD 6.64, 95% CI 11.72 to 1.57)(SOE: low for pain and function). For nonacute low back pain, a systematic review found no clear effects of exercise therapyversus usual care on likelihood of short- or intermediate-term (~6 months) disability, butexercise was associated with lower likelihood of work disability at long-term (~12 months)followup (10 comparisons in 8 trials, OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92) (SOE: moderate forpain and function). For radicular low back pain, three trials not included in the systematic reviews foundeffects that favored exercise versus usual care or no exercise in pain and function, though effects were small (SOE: low for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found MCE associated with lower painintensity at short term (6 trials, WMD 7.80 on 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 10.95 to 4.65)and intermediate term (3 trials, WMD 6.06, 95% CI 10.94 to 1.18) versus generalexercise, but effects were smaller and no longer statistically significant at long-term (4trials, WMD 3.10, 95% CI 7.03 to 0.83). MCE was also associated with better functionin the short term (6 trials, WMD 4.65 on 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 6.20 to 3.11) and longterm (3 trials, WMD 4.72, 95% CI 8.81 to 0.63). One of two subsequent trials found no Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old.

For comparisons involving other types of exercise techniques, there were no clear differences in >20 head-to-head trials of patients with acute or chronic low back pain (SOE: moderate). Harms were poorly reported in trials of exercise. When reported, harms were typically related to muscle soreness and increased pain, or no harms were reported; no serious harms were reported (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included six systematic reviews178-184 with a total of 79 unique trials and one additional large, lower-quality trial.185 The most comprehensive systematic review in the APS/ACP review found no differences between exercise therapy versus no exercise for acute low back pain in pain (3 trials, WMD 0.59 at intermediate term on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 11.51 to 12.69) or function (3 trials, WMD at short term 2.82, 95% CI 15.35 to 9.71 and WMD 2.47 at intermediate term, 95% CI 0.26 to 5.21). 179 For subacute low back pain, there were also no differences in pain (5 trials, WMD 1.89 on a 100-point scale, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.91) or function (4 trials, WMD 1.07, 95% CI 3.18 to 5.32). For chronic low back pain, the APS/ACP review found good evidence that exercise is moderately superior to no exercise for pain relief (19 trials, WMD 10 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 1.31 to 19.09), though the effect on function was small and not statistically significant (17 trials, WMD 3.00 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 0.53 to 6.48). Results of the other reviews were generally consistent with these findings. Based on this evidence, the APS/ACP review concluded that there was fair evidence of no benefit for exercise versus no exercise for acute or subacute low back pain, and good evidence for moderate benefits of exercise versus no exercise for chronic low back pain. We included three fair-quality systematic reviews of exercise for low back pain published subsequent to the APS/ACP review (Table 10; Appendix Tables E13, F13). 186-188 One focused on exercise for nonspecific chronic low back pain187 one evaluated effects of exercise on work disability in patients with nonacute, nonspecific low back pain (duration >4 weeks),188 and the third focused on effects of motor control exercise (MCE), which was not addressed in the APS/ACP review and not covered well in the other reviews. 186 The first review focused on various types of exercise therapy for chronic low back pain and included 37 RCTs (n=3957).187 Shortcomings of this review included limited description of included trial characteristics (including exercise treatments) failure to report statistical heterogeneity for pooled analyses, and lack of sensitivity or subgroup analyses. The systematic review included eight trials from a previous review 179 plus 29 additional trials; it excluded a number of trials in the previous review because it applied more strict criteria to define chronic low back pain ( 12 weeks), and only enrolled trials of patients with nonspecific low back pain. Exercise was compared against wait list/no treatment (8 RCTs), usual care (6 RCTs), back school or education (3 RCTs), and other forms of exercise therapy (11 RCTs). Exercise interventions varied and included general strengthening, stretching, or aerobic exercise; motor control and stabilization exercises; physiotherapy; multidisciplinary programs; and specific Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.46techniques such as the active trunk exercise protocol.187 Comparisons of exercise versus other active interventions (behavioral treatment, passive modalities [TENS, laser, ultrasound, massage], spinal manipulations and psychotherapy), are discussed in the sections of this report addressing those interventions. Outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment, at short term (3 months), intermediate term (6 months), and long term (>6 months). Of the 27 trials providing data for the above comparisons, 189-215 11 (41%) were rated low risk of bias, based on meeting 6 of 11 Cochrane Back Review Group criteria.191-193, 197, 198, 201-203, 207, 209, 214, 216 Methodological flaws included failure to describe adequate randomization methods (26% of trials) or allocation concealment (48%), inadequate description of cointerventions(63%), unclear compliance with treatment (56%), failure to report intention-to-treat analysis (48%), and high or unreported attrition (33%). Given the nature of exercise interventions, blinding of patients and care providers was generally not possible; in addition, 67 percent of trials did not report blinding of outcome assessors. The second review evaluated effects of exercise specifically on work disability in patients with nonacute (>4 weeks), nonspecific low back pain. 188 It included 23 trials (n=4138), 20 of which were included in meta analyses. Sample sizes ranged from 49 to 476 and duration of low back pain varied from 4 weeks to greater than 12 months. Exercise was compared against usual care (13 RCTs, n=3181) and other forms of exercise (11 RCTs). Exercise interventions varied and included stabilization, strengthening, stretching, and mobilization, though exercise regimens were most frequently mixed. About half of the exercise interventions were administered in the context of a cognitive behavioral approach. The majority of interventions (91%) were supervised exercise conducted in an outpatient setting (77%). Nine trials 206, 217-224 (39%) were rated high quality and the remainder were rated low quality, based on risk of bias criteria by Juni et al. Methodological shortcomings included detection bias in 12 trials (52%), selection bias in 9 trials (39%), and attrition bias in 8 trials (35%). The third review included 16 trials of MCE (sample size range 30 to 346, total n=1993). 186 MCE (also referred to as specific stabilization exercise) focuses on strengthening of deep muscles of the spine through a specific stabilization protocol, while reducing unwanted overactivity of other muscles. 225 Methodological limitations of the review are that it did not report details regarding study quality (it reported an overall assessment only), did not report statistical heterogeneity in pooled analyses, and did not report harms. We addressed these issues through additional review and assessment of the primary studies. The review included seven trials of MCE versus various types of general exercise (including sling exercise, trunk strengthening, walking, cardiovascular and McKenzie exercises), 192, 226-231 three trials of MCE versus a minimal intervention (no intervention, advice/education or placebo short-wave therapy and ultrasound),196, 232, 233 and four trials of MCE versus multimodal physical therapy (including ultrasound, electrotherapy, lumbar strengthening, passive physical therapy and general exercise).230, 234-236 Two trials evaluated MCE as part of a multimodal intervention versus other components of that intervention. 237, 238 Eight trials included only chronic low back pain patients;192, 196, 226, 228-230, 232, 233 three trials also included patients with subacute low back pain, but mean duration of symptoms was 25 to 34 months. 231, 234, 236 Three trials focused on patients with recurrent low back pain, with the duration of the current episode ranging from >6 weeks to >3 months.231, 235, 237 Most trials selected patients for inclusion on the basis of tests showing deficits in motor control, but the specific methods and criteria for inclusion varied. The duration of treatment ranged from 6 to10 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.47weeks; six trials evaluated patients 10 to 28 months after the end of treatment. In two trials, MCE was administered through 20 treatment sessions (time frame not described), with followup for 180 days. The systematic review classified 10 trials as high quality, based on scoring 6 points on the 10 point PEDro scale 192, 226, 227, 229, 230, 232-238 and six low quality.196, 227, 229, 231, 233, 234 Common methodological shortcomings included unclear or inappropriate randomization methods and unclear allocation concealment; patients and care providers generally could not be blinded. Some trials also reported discrepancies in baseline characteristics or differential attrition. Data were pooled for short term (6 weeks to <4 months) intermediate term (4 months to <8 months) and long term (8 months <15 months). We identified 17 trials with sample sizes >100 of exercise for low back pain that were not included in the systematic reviews (Table 11; Appendix Tables E14, F14). 239-255 Three trials evaluated exercise versus no exercise or usual care for acute to subacute low back pain,244, 254, 255 two trials compared different types of exercise for patients primarily with subacute low back pain,243, 246 four trials compared exercise versus no exercise or usual care for chronic low back pain,250-252, 256 four trials compared different types of exercise for chronic low back pain,241, 249, 251, 253 and four trials evaluated exercise versus various other interventions for radicular low back pain.239, 240, 242, 248 Exercise techniques varied but included general exercise, strengthening, the McKenzie method, exercise based on a treatment-based classification (TBC) system, the Alexander technique, periodized musculoskeletal rehabilitation, walking, MCE and others. Four trials were rated good quality, 241, 242, 250, 252 seven trials fair quality,239, 240, 244, 245, 249, 253-255 and five poor quality.243, 246, 248, 251, 256 Methodological shortcomings included inadequate allocation concealment, failure to clearly described cointerventions, and failure to report compliance to treatment. Patients and people administering exercise could not be effectively blinded given the nature of the interventions. We also identified 28 trials not included in the systematic reviews that evaluated exercise therapy for subacute to chronic low back pain, but enrolled fewer than 100 patients. Eighteen trials compared exercise versus no exercise or usual care 197, 200, 257-272 and 15 compared different forms of exercise.197, 200, 258, 261, 271, 273-282 Given the number of larger trials on exercise, we did not abstract these studies in detail. Exercise Therapy V ersus Placebo, Usual Care, or No Treatment Acute to Subacute Low Back Pain As noted above, a systematic review included in the prior APS/ACP review found no differences between exercise therapy versus usual care for acute low back pain in pain (3 trials, WMD 0.59 at intermediate term on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 11.51 to 12.69) or function (3 trials, WMD at short term 2.82, 95% CI 15.35 to 9.71 and WMD 2.47 at intermediate term, 95% CI 0.26 to 5.21).179 For subacute low back pain, there were also no differences in pain (5 trials, WMD 1.89 on a 100-point scale, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.91) or function (4 trials, WMD 1.07, 95% CI 3.18 to 5.32). We identified three subsequent trials of exercise therapy for acute to subacute low back pain. 244, 254, 255 For acute or subacute low back pain, a fair-quality trial (n=259) found the combination of exercise plus advice associated with lower pain scores versus no exercise or Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.48advice at the end of the 6-week intervention (mean difference -1.5 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI -2.2 to -0.7); the difference favored exercise plus advice at 3 months (mean difference -1.1, 95% CI-2.0 to -0.3), but was smaller and no longer statistically significant at 12 months (mean difference 0.8, 95% CI -1.7 to 0.1). 255 Exercise plus advice was also associated with better scores on the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) (differences 1.1 to 1.3 on a 0 to10 scale) and on a Global Perceived Effect scale at 3 months. Differences on the RDQ tended to favor exercise plus advice (mean differences 0.9 to 1.3) but were small and not statistically different. For acute low back pain, one fair-quality trial (n=148) found six sessions of McKenzie exercise over 3 weeks associated with lower pain intensity at one (mean difference, 0.4 points on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI -0.8 to -0.1) and 3 weeks (-0.7, 95% CI -1.2 to -0.1) versus usual care, though effects were small. 254 There were no differences in disability at either time point (mean differences 0.2 and 0.3 on the RDQ), global perceived effects (mean differences 0.3 to 0.5 on a 5 to 5 scale), or risk of developing persistent low back pain (RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.6).The third, fair-quality trial (n=246) found no differences between 8 weeks of trunk muscle stabilization exercise versus no treatment in patients with 8 to 12 weeks of low back pain, with outcomes measured as 6 to 24 months. 244 Chronic Low Back Pain As described above, a systematic review included in the APS/ACP review found exercise moderately superior to placebo for pain relief (19 trials, WMD 10 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 1.31 to 19.09), though the effect on function was small and not statistically significant (17 trials, WMD 3.00 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 0.53 to 6.48). 179 A more recent systematic review187 that used more restrictive inclusion criteria also found exercise therapy associated with decreased pain intensity (3 trials, WMD 9.23, 95% CI -16.02 to -2.43) 193, 200, 210 and better function (3 RCTs, WMD 12.35 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI -23.0 to -1.69)193, 200, 210 versus usual care at the end of treatment. Effects on function were smaller but remained statistically significant at intermediate- and long-term followup (mean differences 5.23 and 3.17). Effects on pain were also smaller, and no longer statistically significant at long-term followup (mean difference 4.94, 95% CI 10.45 to 0.58). 193, 203, 214 One good-quality trial (n=579) not included in the systematic review used a factorial design that randomized patients to usual care, massage, 6 sessions of Alexander, or 24 sessions of Alexander; half of the patients in each group was also randomized to exercise. 252 Exercise was associated with fewer days with low back pain (in the previous 4 weeks) at 3 months (difference 6 days, 95% CI 9 to 3) versus no exercise but the effect was not significant at 12 months (difference 2 days, 95% CI 5 to 1). Effects on the RDQ also favored exercise at 3 months (mean difference 0.9, 95% CI 1.76 to 0.04) and 12 months (1.29, 95% CI 2.25 to 0.43). There were no differences between exercise versus no exercise in the SF-36 Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) at 3 or 12 months (mean differences of 3.0 and 1.9 on a 0-100 scale); exercise was associated with small positive effects on the mental component score of the SF-36 (MCS) at 3 months (mean difference 4.4, 95% CI 0.65 to 7.43 on 0 to 100 scale) that were not sustained to 12 months (mean difference, 0.9 95% CI (2.8 to 4.6). In the same trial, compared with usual care, 24 Alexander technique sessions were associated with fewer days with back pain at 3 months (difference 16 days, 95% CI 21 to 11) and 12 months (difference 18 days, 95% CI 23 to 13) and with better function at both time frames Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.49(mean differences on the RDQ 2.91, 95% CI 4.16 to 1.66 at 3 months and 3.4, 95% CI 4.6 to 0.03 at 12 months). The 24 session intervention was also associated with better scores on the SF-36 PCS at both time points (mean differences 7.5 and 11.3); effects on the MCS were smaller and not statistically significant (mean differences 3.4 and 4.0). Although six Alexander technique sessions were also associated with fewer low back pain days (mean differences 11 days at 3 months and 10 days at 12 months) and better scores on the RDQ (mean differences at 3 and 12 months 1.71 and 1.4, respectively) compared with usual care, effects were smaller and not as well sustained. For all outcomes, the addition of exercise to Alexander method had little impact compared with Alexander method sessions alone for all outcomes. For example, the reduction in low back pain days was similar (20 days) following 24 sessions with or without exercise, as were mean effects on the RDQ. Six sessions of Alexander plus exercise were almost as beneficial as 24 sessions without exercise with respect to effects on the number of low back pain days and function. Two trials 196, 232 included in another systematic review186 found MCE associated with lower pain scores in the short term (WMD, 12.48 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 19.04 to 5.93), intermediate term (WMD, 10.18, 95% CI 16.64 to 3.72), and at long term (WMD, 13.32 95% CI 19.75 to 6.90) versus a minimal intervention. Each trial favored MCE at all time points. MCE was also associated with lower disability at short term (3 trials, WMD 9.00 on 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 15.28 to 2.73).196, 232, 233 Effects on disability were somewhat smaller at intermediate term (WMD 5.62, 95% CI10.46 to 0.77) and long term (WMD, 6.64, 95% CI 11.72 to 1.57),based on two trials. 196, 232 Across trials, estimates consistently favored MCE. A poor-quality trial (n=240) not included in the systematic reviews found different intensities of periodized musculoskeletal rehabilitation (PMR) training (2, 3, and 4 days per week for 12 weeks) for chronic low back pain associated with lower pain intensity at 13 weeks versus no training (mean differences ranged from 0.74 for twice per week to 1.35 for four times per week on 0-10 scale) and better function based on the ODI (mean differences ranged from 7.3 for twice per week to 12 for four times per week, 0 to 100 scale). 251 It also found training associated with better (higher) SF-36 PCS scores (mean differences ranged from 5.2 for twice per week to 10.7 for four times per week, 0 to 100 scale) and MCS scores (mean differences ranged from 7.1 for twice per week to 11.7 for four times per week, 0 to 100 scale) at 13 weeks versus no training. We also identified two additional trials (n=100 and 105) of exercise for subacute to chronic low back pain (mean duration of symptoms not reported). 250, 256 One good-quality trial found no differences between 10 weeks of supervised general exercise including back and abdomen muscle stabilization) versus avoidance of hard physical activity, at the end of treatment or at 12 months (mean differences 0.07, 95% CI 0.9 to 0.70 and 0.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 0.6 on a 0 to10 scale, respectively). 250 There were also no differences on the RDQ (mean differences 0.6, 95% CI 2.2 to 1.0 and 1.2, 95% CI 3.3 to 1.0, respectively) or on the EQ5D. A poor-quality trial (n=105) found no differences between exercise versus usual care on the ODI at the end of 12 weeks of treatment (mean difference 1.9 on 0 to 100-point scale) and at 1 year (mean difference 1.8) among patients who had undergone functional multidisciplinary rehabilitation. 256 A systematic review of exercise therapy for nonacute low back pain versus usual care that specifically evaluated the outcome work disability found no effects at short-term (~4 weeks) or Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.50intermediate-term (~6 months) followup, based on pooled analyses of high-quality studies (6 comparisons in 5 trials, OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.25 and 5 comparisons in 4 trials, OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.34, respectively).188 However, exercise, was associated with lower likelihood of work disability at long-term (~12 months) followup (10 comparisons in 8 trials, OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92). An additional 16 trials with fewer than 100 participants compared exercise versus no exercise or usual care for chronic low back pain. 197, 200, 257-267, 270-272 For pain, 11 trials reported differences favoring exercise;257, 258, 260, 261, 263, 264, 266, 267, 270-272 the other five found no differences among groups.197, 200, 259, 262, 265 Of the 12 trials that reported on function, results favored exercise in nine258, 260, 261, 263-265, 270-272 and three found no differences.197, 200, 262 Quality of life was reported by five trials, three of which favored exercise260-262 and two of which found no difference among groups.197, 200 Global improvement was reported by two studies, with results favoring exercise in one trial264 but not the other.197 Exercise Therapy V ersus Advice Subacute to Chronic Low Back Pain Two trials not included in the systematic reviews evaluated exercise therapy versus advice for subacute to chronic low back pain.245, 268 One fair-quality trial (n=136) found no differences between 8 weeks of supervised Nordic walking or unsupervised Nordic walking versus advice to remain active at the end of treatment for pain (mean improvement 8.8, 3.4, 4.8 respectively on the 0-30 Low back pain rating scale [LBRS]) or on the functional portion of the LBRS (mean improvement 7.4, 3.2, 3.8 respectively on a 0 to 30 scale) or Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) though effects were largest with supervised Nordic walking. 245 No differences between treatments were seen on the EQ-5D. One very small trial (n=21) found 4 weeks of supervised stabilization exercise associated with greater pain reduction versus advice, but there was no difference on the ODI. 268 Exercise Therapy V ersus Education or Back School Chronic Low Back Pain The systematic review187 included three trials of exercise (yoga, Pilates and MCE) versus education or back school.190, 196, 213 One small trial (n=53) found no differences between 10- to 60-minute sessions of Pilates versus back school in post intervention pain (mean difference 0.2 on a 0 to10 scale) or function (mean difference 0.8 the ODI).190 The trials of yoga 213 and MCE196 are discussed in those sections of this report. One subsequent good-quality trial (n=148) of weekly McKenzie exercises versus back school found no differences in mean pain intensity scores at the end of four weeks of treatment or at three or six months (mean differences -0.48 to -0.71 on a 0 to 10 scale). 242 Exercise was associated with better function at the end of therapy (mean difference -2.37, 95% CI -3.99 to -0.76) but effects were smaller and no longer statistically significant at longer followup. Exercise was also associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing a 5 point improvement on the RDQ (53% vs. 30%, RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.7). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.51One other small trial (n=61) reported no differences between exercise therapy versus a single education session or between exercise versus conventional physical therapy in pain of function for subacute to chronic low back pain at 6 or 12 months.269 Radicular Low Back Pain Three trials (n=181 to 348) predominantly enrolled patients with radiculopathy (70 to 100% of sample); the duration of symptoms varied from acute to chronic.239, 240, 248 None were included in the systematic reviews. For subacute low back pain with radiculopathy, one fair-quality trial compared 8 weeks of symptom guided, back-related exercise versus sham (nonback related) exercise; >50 percent of the sample had lower extremity motor deficits. 240 Pain scores at the end of the 8-week intervention favored exercise (mean difference 0.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 0.09, on a 0-10 scale) but effects were small. There were no differences on the RDQ or measures of health-related quality of life. Exercise was associated with greater likelihood of patients reporting being \"much better\" at the end of treatment (8 weeks) versus sham exercises (80% vs. 60%, RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.6) but effects were smaller and not statistically significant at 12 months (84% versus 76%, RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.3). Patient satisfaction was similar at 12 months (93.5% vs. 90.5%).240 In one fair-quality trial, the difference in median pain scores at 6 months for education plus four physical therapy sessions was 3.0 (on 0-10 scale) compared with usual care and 1.0 compared with education alone, both favoring exercise, but tests for statistical significance were not performed. 239 Education plus physical therapy was also associated with better function versus usual care (mean difference in improvement on the RDQ 2.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.9) but not versus education alone (mean difference in improvement 0.4, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.06). A poor-quality trial found no statistically significant differences between a maximum of 8 weeks of physical therapy, bed rest or continuation of usual activities in pain or disability at up to 6 months in patients with acute sciatica, though effects favored physical therapy. 248 Mean differences between physical therapy and control groups at 6 months ranged from 1.4 to 1.0 on a 0-10 scale for pain and for the Quebec Disability Scale from 0.7 to 2.7 on a 0-100 scale. Most patients (70%) had a prior history of low back pain or sciatica. Exercise V ersus Other Active Interventions Results for comparisons involving exercise versus other active interventions are summarized in the results sections for nonexercise interventions. Exercise V ersus Exercise Acute and Subacute Low Back Pain The APS/ACP review included a higher-quality systematic review183 with one higher-quality trial that found marginal differences between the McKenzie method versus flexion exercises (mean differences, 2 points on a 0 to 100 scale) for acute pain, though a second, lower-quality trial found the McKenzie method associated with large benefits on short-term (5 days) disability (mean difference, 22 points on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 26 to 18). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.52Two subsequent poor-quality trials which primarily enrolled patients with subacute low back pain found no differences among different types of exercise.243, 246 One trial compared physical therapy based on a TBC plus graded exposure, TBC plus graded activity, and TBC only243 and one trial compared lumbar extensor strength training versus \"regular\" physical therapy.246 A small (n=33) trial of patients with acute low back pain found no differences between regular trunk exercises versus trunk exercises plus specific core stability core exercises through 3 months.274 Chronic Low Back Pain The APS/ACP review29 found few trials that directly compared different types of exercise for chronic low back pain, with no clear differences. The APS/ACP review also included a meta-regression that was conducted in conjunction with a higher-quality systematic review. 283 Exercise therapy factors associated with greater effects on pain in the meta-analysis were use of individually designed programs (5.4-point improvement in pain scores, 95% credible interval 1.3 to 9.5), supervised home exercise (6.1 points, 95% CI 0.2 to 12.4), group exercise (4.8 points, 95% CI 0.2 to 9.4), and individually supervised programs (5.9 points, 95% credible interval 2.1 to 9.8). High-dose exercise programs (20 or more hours of intervention time) were not superior to low-dose programs. Interventions that included additional noninvasive therapy were superior (5.1 points, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.4) to those without additional noninvasive therapy. The exercise regimens that were most effective used stretching and strengthening, though there was some overlap with other types of exercise (aerobic, mobilizing, or other specific exercise methods). The meta-regression estimated that an intervention incorporating all of the features of an effective exercise regimen would improve pain scores by 18.1 points (95% CI 11.1 to 25.0) compared with no treatment, and improve function by 5.5 points (95% CI 0.5 to 10.5) compared with no treatment. However, trials to directly confirm the incremental benefits of exercise therapies utilizing these factors are not available. A more recent systematic review 186 found MCE associated with lower pain intensity at short term (6 trials, WMD 7.80 on 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 10.95 to 4.65)192, 226-229, 231 and at intermediate term (3 trials, WMD 6.06, 95% CI 10.94 to 1.18)192, 227, 230 versus general exercise, but effects were smaller and no longer statistically significant at long term (4 trials, WMD 3.10, 95% CI 7.03 to 0.83). 192, 227, 228, 230 Individual trial estimates at all time points generally favored MCE, though most differences did not reach statistical significance. MCE was also associated with better function in the short term (6 trials, WMD4.65 on 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI6.20 to 3.11) 192, 226-229, 231 intermediate term (3 trials, WMD 4.86 95% CI8.59 to 1.13)192, 227, 230 and long term (3 trials, WMD 4.72, 95% CI 8.81 to 0.63).192, 227, 230 Individual trial estimates generally favored MCE at all time points, with one trial reporting a statistically significant effect. 227 A subsequent trial (n=172) found no differences between MCE versus graded activity in pain at 2 (mean difference 0.0 on 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.8), 6 (mean difference 0.0 (95% CI -0.8 to 0.8), or 12 months (mean difference 0.1 (95% CI-0.7 to 0.9).253 MCE was associated with better function at 2 (mean difference -0.8 on 0 to 24 RDQ, 95% CI 2.2 to 0.7), 6 (mean difference -0.8, 95% CI -2.3 to 0.6), and 12 months (mean difference -0.6, 95% CI -2.0 to 0.9), though differences were not statistically significant; there were no differences in Global Perceived Effect Scale scores or SF-36 mental or physical component summary scores. 253 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.53Another systematic review187 included 11 trials of other exercise therapy comparisons191, 192, 197, 199, 201, 202, 205-207, 211, 215 Results could not be pooled because of differences in the exercise regimens and comparisons evaluated. Only two trials reported statistically significant differences among groups. One low risk of bias trial (n=240) found 12 weeks of motor control exercise associated with better function and global perceived effect at 8 weeks (mean adjusted between-group difference 2.9 and 1.7, respectively) versus general exercise, but there were no differences by 6 months. 192 One high risk of bias trial (n=72) found 3 months of aerobic exercise associated with greater pain relief versus lumbar flexion exercise at the end of treatment.211 Two subsequent trials that compared various forms of exercise in patients with chronic low back pain found no differences in pain relief.241, 249 One good-quality trial (n=201) compared supervised exercise focused on core strengthening versus home exercise241 and the other compared exercise therapy, a walking program or usual physical therapy.249 One poor-quality trial (n=180 for exercise groups) that evaluated different intensities of exercise found the greatest intensity of PMR training (4 days per week, 1563 repetitions) associated with greater pain relief (mean difference 0.61 95% CI 0.97 to 0.25, 0-10 scale), reduced disabilities (mean difference 4.7 on the ODI, 95% CI 7.5 to 1.9), and improved quality of life based on SF-36 PCS (mean difference 5.5, 95% CI 2.5 to 8.5, 0 to 100 scale), and MCS (mean difference 4.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 7.6 on 0-100 scale) compared with the least intense regimen (2 days per week, 564 repetitions). 251 Fourteen smaller trials (n<100) also compared different forms of exercise for chronic low back pain. In four trials, results for pain favored global postural reeducation versus stabilization exercises; exercise and stabilization training versus routine exercises; periodized resistance training versus periodized aerobic exercise, or the addition of static or dynamic back endurance exercise to the McKenzie method versus the McKenzie method alone. 261, 275, 280, 281 Seven other trials found no clear differences among different types of exercises in outcomes related to pain.200, 258, 271, 273, 277-279, 282 Similar results were reported for other outcomes, with most trials reporting no clear differences. Radicular Low Back Pain One small (n=68) trial284 of patients with spinal stenosis found no clear difference between the addition of unweighted treadmill walking versus stationary cycling to an exercise program in short-term outcomes. Harms Harms were poorly reported in trials of exercise.29, 186, 187 When reported, harms were typically related to muscle soreness and increased pain,232, 241, 246, 249, 255, 285 or no harms were reported.192, 230, 236, 239, 243, 250, 252 Serious harms were not reported in patients who underwent exercise therapy.248, 253 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.54Exercise and Related Interventions: Pilates Key Points For chronic low back pain, a systematic review included seven trials that found Pilates associated with small (mean difference 1.6 to 4.1 points) or no clear effects on painat the end of treatment versus usual care plus physical activity and no clear effects onfunction (SOE: low for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, three trials found no clear differences between Pilates versusother types of exercises in pain or function (SOE: low for pain and function). Detailed Synthesis The previous APS/ACP review did not specifically evaluate Pilates. A systematic review on exercise therapies included in the APS/ACP review did not include any studies of Pilates. A fair-quality systematic review published subsequent to the APS/ACP review286 included seven trials of Pilates versus usual care (sample size range17 to 86, total n=301)195, 287-292 and four trials of Pilates versus other exercise techniques (sample size range 12 to 83, total n=199) (Table 10; Appendix Tables E15; F15). 293-296 The trials exclusively or primarily (~75%)292, 293 enrolled patients with chronic low back pain. Pilates interventions varied but generally included one or three supervised mat small group classes per week plus home sessions; some included specific Pilates equipment. Usual care was generally less well described, but typically involved no specific treatment apart from medications and no restriction from regular physical activity. One study allowed both groups to continue physical therapy and regular exercise 289 and another provided an educational booklet on low back pain.290 Exercise techniques in trials of Pilates versus other exercise methods included supervised stationary cycling, traditional lumbar stabilization exercises, McKenzie exercises and a generalized exercise regimen that included aerobics, stretching and strengthening. The duration of interventions in the trials ranged from four to 12 weeks. Three trials followed participants 16 to 18 weeks beyond the end of the active intervention. Most trials were conducted in Brazil, Australia and the United Kingdom and three trials were published as dissertations. 289, 293, 297 Based on the 16-item McMaster Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies, review authors classified four trials excellent (15 or 16 out of 16 points), 289, 290, 294, 296 four very good (13-14 points),195, 287, 291, 292 one (9-10 points)293 and four poor (0-8 points).288, 295-298 Methodological shortcomings included inability to blind patients (most trials blinded outcomes assessors) and high attrition in trials with longer followup.294, 296 Pilates V ersus Usual Care and Physical Activity Chronic Low Back Pain Seven trials195, 287-292 included in the systematic review evaluated the effects of Pilates on pain.286 Results across trials were somewhat inconsistent. Although four trials (sample sizes 22 to 86) found Pilates associated with lower pain scores versus usual care plus physical activity at the end of treatment (mean differences 1.6 to 4.1 points on a 0- to 10-point scale), three trials found no significant effects (mean differences 0.2 to 1.9 points). One trial (n=86) found smaller effects 18 weeks after the end of therapy (mean difference 0.9, 95% CI 1.9 to 0.1) that Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.55were no longer statistically significant, compared with the effects at the end of therapy (mean difference 2.2, 95% CI 2.2, 95% CI 3.2 to 1.1).290 The largest effect (4.1, 95% CI 6.3 to 1.8 on 010 scale) was observed in the trial with the highest total class hours (2 hours per week for 15 weeks, n=22). 287 Total hours in the other trials ranged from 12 to 24 hours of class and/or home exercise; there was no clear relationship between the intensity of treatment and estimates of effect. Trial data were not pooled. Seven trials 195, 289-292, 297, 298 included in the systematic review evaluated effects of Pilates on function.286 Most trials showed no clear beneficial effects. Two trials found no differences between Pilates versus usual care on the ODI at the end of a 6-195 or 12-week course of therapy 297 (mean difference 0.0 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 8.5 to 8.5 in one trial and 7.1, 95% CI 17.6 to 3.4 in the other trial). Five trials measured disability with the RDQ. The largest, fair-quality trial (n=86) found Pilates associated with lower (better) RDQ scores at the end of a 6-week intervention of twice weekly 60-minute Pilates sessions (mean difference 2.7, 95% CI 4.4 to 1.0), but effects were smaller and no longer statistically significant at 24 weeks (mean difference,1.4, 95% CI 3.1 to 0.0 at 24 weeks, 0 to 24 scale). 290 Four smaller trials (n=20 to 39) reported inconsistent effects of Pilates at the end of 4 to 12 weeks of treatment, with two trials finding Pilates associated with better RDQ scores (mean differences 1.2, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.0 292 and 2.6, 95% CI 5.2 to 0.1289) and two trials finding nonstatistically significant differences in favor of Pilates (mean differences 2.1 p>0.21, no CI reported. 283 and 1.7 (95% CI 0.4 to 3.8).298 Pilates V ersus Other Exercise Chronic Low Back Pain There were no differences between Pilates versus traditional lumbar stabilization exercises (1 trial, n=12),293 Pilates versus McKenzie and daily postural correction exercises (1 trial, n=40295), or Pilates versus general exercise (including aerobics, stretching, and strengthening) (1 trial, n=83 296) in pain or function at the end of a 4- to 7-week course of treatment. One trial (n=64) found 8 weeks of Pilates (50- to 60-minute sessions 3 times a week) associated with lower pain (mean difference 1.1, 95% CI 2.1 to 0.1) and better ODI scores (difference in means 6.5%, 95% CI 11.8 to 1.1) at the end of treatment, but effects were smaller and no longer statistically significant at 24-week followup. 294 Attrition was high in this trial and greater in patients randomized to cycling. Exercise and Related Interventions: Tai Chi Key Points For chronic low back pain, two trials found tai chi associated with improved pain-relatedoutcomes versus wait list or no tai chi (mean differences 0.9 and 1.3 on a 0 to 10 scale);one trial also found tai chi associated with better function (mean difference 2.6 on theRDQ, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.7) (SOE: low for pain and function). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.56For chronic low back pain, one trial found tai chi associated with lower pain intensity versus backward walking or jogging through 6 months (mean differences 0.7 and 0.8),but there were no differences versus swimming (SOE: low). One trial of tai chi reported a small temporary increase in back pain symptoms and one trial reported no harms (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis Tai chi was not specifically evaluated in the APS/ACP review. We identified two trials of tai chi versus no treatment for chronic low back pain with no treatment (2 RCT, n=480) (Table 12; Appendix Tables E16, F16; 285, 299 one of the trials also evaluated tai chi versus other exercise interventions including backward walking, jogging and swimming.299 Tai chi sessions were eighteen 40-minute sessions over 10 weeks in one trial285 and 45-minute sessions 5 days a week for 6 months in the other.299 Both trials were rated fair quality. One trial did not adequately report allocation concealment and attrition299 and adherence was unclear in both trials. The nature of the intervention precluded blinding of participants and people administering the interventions, but both trials reported blinding of outcomes assessors. Tai Chi V ersus Wait List or No Exercise Chronic Low Back Pain Both trials found tai chi for chronic low back pain associated with improved pain-related outcomes versus wait list or no tai chi.285, 299 One trial (n=160) found 10 weeks of tai chi associated with lower pain intensity versus wait list (mean difference 1.3 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 07 to 1.9) and better function (mean difference 2.6 on the RDQ, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.7); the proportion of patients who experienced 30 percent improvement in pain intensity was 46 percent vs. 15 percent and the proportion who experienced 30 percent improvement in RDQ was 50 versus 24 percent. 285 Similar results were seen for pain bothersomeness (mean difference 1.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.5; proportion with 30% improvement 50% vs. 18%).285 The other trial (n=188 for this comparison) found tai chi associated with lower pain intensity at 26 weeks versus no exercise (mean scores 2.7 vs. 3.6 on a 0 to 10 scale). 299 Tai Chi V ersus Other Exercise Interventions Chronic Low Back Pain One trial (n=273 for this comparison) found Tai chi associated with lower pain intensity versus backward walking or jogging at 3 months (mean differences 0.6 and 0.7 on a 0 to 10 scale, respectively) and 6 months (mean differences 0.7 and 0.8), but there were no differences versus swimming (mean differences 0.1 at both time points). 299 Harms One trial reported a small increase in back pain symptoms that resolved by 3-4 weeks in three patients who underwent tai chi,285 the other trial reported no harms.299 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.57Exercise and Related Interventions: Y oga Key Points For chronic low back pain, one trial found Iyengar yoga associated with lower pain scores (24 vs. 37 on a 0-100 V AS, p<0.001) and better function (18 vs. 21 on the 0 to 100ODI, p<0.01, on a 0 to 100 scale) versus usual care at 24 weeks (SOE: low for pain andfunction). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found yoga associated with lower painintensity and better function versus exercise in most trials, though effects were small anddifferences were not always snot statistically significant (5 trials) (SOE: low for pain andfunction). For chronic low back pain, yoga was associated with lower short-term pain intensity versuseducation (5 trials, SMD 0.45,- 95% CI 0.63 to 0.26; I2=0%), but effects were smallerand not statistically significant at followup (4 trials, SMD 0.28, 95% CI0.58to 0.02, I2=47%); yoga was also associated with better function at short-term (5 trials,SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.25; to 0.11; I2=40%) (SOE: moderate for pain and function). Reporting of harms was suboptimal, but adverse events when reported were almost allclassified as mild to moderate (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included three trials (n=22 to 101) of yoga for chronic low back pain.194, 207, 213 One trial evaluated Viniyoga194 and two trials Iyengar yoga;207, 213 comparator interventions were exercise or self-care. The APS/ACP review concluded that there was fair evidence that Viniyoga is moderately effective for chronic low back pain, with insufficient evidence to judge the effectiveness of other yoga styles, or the effectiveness of yoga for acute low back pain. A good-quality systematic review 300 published subsequent to the APS/ACP review included 10 trials,194, 207, 210, 213, 301-306 including the 3 trials described above (Table 10; Appendix Tables E17, F17). All trials enrolled patients with chronic (>3-month duration) low back pain, except for one small trial (n=12) which enrolled patients with back pain for >3 weeks. Sample sizes ranged from 12 to 313 (total sample=1,056). All yoga interventions included specific asanas (poses), pranayama (breathing), and relaxation, and many included meditation or mental focus practices. The most common specific yoga styles evaluated were Iyengar (5 trials) and Viniyoga (2 trials). Most trials evaluated yoga classes lasting 75 minutes once weekly with recommended home practice for 30 minutes 5 to 7 days per week, though one trial 210 evaluated all-day sessions over a 1-week period. Trials generally reported starting out with simple or restorative yoga poses and progressing to more challenging poses. The duration of active intervention ranged from 1 to 24 weeks. Outcomes were assessed at the end of therapy in all trials; five trials also assessed outcomes 14 to 52 weeks after the end of therapy. Y oga was compared versus usual care (2 trials), education (7 trials), and supervised exercise therapy (3 trials). Exercise therapy interventions varied, but included stretching, strengthening, and aerobic exercise. Two trials were conducted in Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.58India,210, 302 one in the United Kingdom,301 and the remainder in the United States. Two trials213, 302 were rated high risk of bias (based on meeting fewer than 6 of 10 Cochrane Back Review Group criteria) and the remainder were rated low risk of bias; methodological shortcomings included inadequate reporting of randomization and allocation concealment methods and high attrition. Blinding of patients and caregivers was generally not possible, though 8 of the 10 trials reported blinding of outcome assessors. We identified two additional trials 307, 308 not included in the systematic review of yoga for chronic low back pain (Table 13; Appendix Tables E18; F18).307, 308 One Indian trial (n=60) compared a 60-minute class of Iyengar Y oga per week for 4 weeks (plus home practice) versus exercises (primarily strengthening exercises) 307 and a US trial (n=95) compared once versus twice weekly 75-minute hatha yoga classes over 12 weeks.308 Both trials were rated fair quality; methodological shortcomings included unclear allocation concealment methods and unblinded design. Y oga V ersus Usual Care Chronic Low Back Pain Two trials evaluated yoga for 6 or 12 weeks versus usual care.194, 306 One trial (n=90) found Iyengar yoga associated with lower pain scores (mean 24 vs. 37 on a 0-100 V AS, p<0.001), better function (mean 18 vs. 21 on the 0 to 100 ODI, p<0.01, on a 0 to 100 scale), and better Beck Depression Inventory score (mean 5 vs.8 on 0 to 63 scale, p<0.01) at 24 weeks. 306 Another trial (n=22) found yoga associated with trends towards favorable effects on the ODI and Beck Depression Inventory, but was underpowered and reported large baseline differences among groups, precluding reliable conclusions. 194 Y oga V ersus Exercise Chronic Low Back Pain Effects of yoga versus exercise on pain were reported in four trials, with somewhat inconsistent results.207, 304, 307, 309 The two most well-conducted trials evaluated a 12-week course of yoga. One trial (n=101) found yoga associated with lower pain scores at 26 weeks (mean difference between groups 1.4 on an 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 2.5, 0.2), 207 but a larger trial (n=228) found small and nonstatistically significant differences between 12 weeks of yoga versus exercise in pain scores at 6, 12, or 26 weeks and in the likelihood of experiencing a 30 or 50 percent improvement in pain. 304 Another (n=80) trial found a weeklong intensive in-residence yoga program associated with lower pain scores than exercise at 1 week (3.40 vs. 4.85 on 0 to 10 scale, p<0.001). 309 Another small (n=60) trial found 4 weeks of yoga associated with lower pain score versus exercise at 6 months (mean 1.8 vs. 3.8 on a 0 to 10 V AS, p=0.001).307 Effects of yoga versus exercise on back-specific disability were reported in three trials, with somewhat inconsistent effects.207, 210, 304 A large (n=228), well-conducted trial found no differences between 12 weeks of yoga versus exercise in the mean RDQ score or in the likelihood of 30 or 50 percent improvement at 6, 12, or 26 weeks,304 but another well-conducted trial (n=101) found 12 weeks of yoga associated with a better (lower) RDQ score versus exercise at 12 weeks Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.59(adjusted mean difference 1.8 on a 0 to 24 scale, 95% CI 3.5 to 0.10), though differences were not statistically significant at 6 or 26 weeks.207 One trial (n=80) found an intensive, weeklong yoga program associated with a lower (better) ODI score versus exercise at 1 week (mean 18.70 versus 35.75 on a 0 to 100 scale, p<0.01). 210 One trial (n=101) found no difference between yoga versus exercise in health-related quality of life as measured by the SF-36 MCS or PCS.207 Two smaller trials found yoga associated with better health-related quality of life based on other measures of health-related qualify of life (WHO-QOL-BREF or the CDC-HRQOL-4 questionnaire). 307, 310 One trial found no statistically significant differences between yoga versus exercise in the likelihood of global improvement or patient satisfaction at 6, 12, or 26 weeks, though results favored yoga, particularly at 12 weeks (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.75). 304 One trial (n=80) found that compared with exercise, an intensive, weeklong yoga program associated with greater improvement in the Beck Depression index (BDI) and measures of anxiety at 1 week (p0.001). 309 Yoga Versus Education Y oga was associated with better short-term (up to 12 weeks) mean pain scores versus education (5 trials, SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.26; I2=0%) but effects were smaller and not statistically significant at longer-term (~1 year) followup (4 trials, SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.02; I2=47%). 300 In the trials, differences in mean pain scores ranged from 0.37 to 2.4 on a 0 to 10 scale at 26 to 28 weeks. One of the trials included in the review (n=228) also found yoga associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing >30 percent improvement in pain at 26 weeks (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.84); results also favored yoga for likelihood of >50 percent improvement, but the difference was just below the threshold for statistical significance (RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.96 to 4.73). 304 Another small (n=30) trial also found yoga associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing clinically meaningful ( 2 points) pain relief, but the estimate was imprecise (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.13 to 19.1). 303 Y oga was associated with better back-specific disability versus education at short-term (5 trials, SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.66 to 0.11; I2=40%). 300 In the three largest trials, mean differences on the RDQ at 26 weeks ranged from 0.37 to 3.6 on a 0 to 24 scale, favoring yoga.207, 304, 305 The largest (n=313), fair-quality trial reported found 12 weeks of yoga associated with lower (better) RDQ scores through 12 months (mean difference 1.57, 95% CI 2.71 to 0.42). 305 One trial (n=228) included in the review also found yoga associated with greater likelihood of experiencing 50 percent improvement in RDQ at 26 weeks (RR, 1.90, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.99). 304 A smaller trial (n=30) also found yoga associated with greater likelihood of experiencing a 30 percent improvement in the RDQ, but the difference was not statistically significant (67% vs. 40%, OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.8 to 3.4). 303 Y oga was also associated with better SF-12 or SF-36 scores versus education at short-term (up to 12 weeks) followup (3 trials, SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.47; I2=0%), but the difference was slightly smaller and not statistically significant at longer-term followup (2 trials, SMD 0.18, 95% 300 In the largest trial (n=313), mean differences on the SF-12 Physical Component and Mental Component Summary Scores were small (0.42 to 2.02) and not statistically significant at any time point. 305 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.60Y oga was associated with greater likelihood of global improvement at 12 weeks in two trials (RR 3.27, 95% CI 1.89 to 5.66; I2=0%).300 In the larger trial (n=228), a similar effect was also present at 26 weeks (RR 2.57. 95% CI 1.39 to 4.78).304 It also found yoga associated with greater likelihood of satisfaction with care through12 weeks (RR 3.95, 95% CI 1.90 to 8.21). Once Versus Twice Weekly Yoga Classes One fair-quality trial (n=95) compared once versus twice weekly 75-minute Hatha yoga classes for 12 weeks.308 There were no statistically significant differences in measures of pain, the RDQ, or the SF-36. Harms The systematic review reported adverse events from three trials.300 Reporting of adverse events was suboptimal, though adverse events were almost all classified as mild to moderate, with no clear difference in risk of serious adverse events. One trial published subsequent to the systematic review reported no adverse events 307 and one trial of once versus twice weekly yoga classes reported no differences in risk of any adverse event, which were primarily musculoskeletal. 308 Psychological Therapies Key Points For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found progressive relaxation superior to wait list control for post-treatment pain intensity (3 trials, mean difference 19.77 on 0 to 100 V AS, 95% CI -34 to 5.20, I2=57%) and functional status (3 trials, standardized mean difference 0.88, 95% CI 1.36 to 0.39, I2=0%) (SOE: low for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found electromyography (EMG) biofeedback associated with lower pain intensity at the end of treatment (3 trials, SMD 0.80, 95% CI 1.32 to 0.28, I2=0%), with no clear effect on function (3 trials) (SOE: low for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found operant therapy associated with lower pain intensity at the end of treatment (3 trials, standardized mean difference 0.43, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.1, I2=0%), with no clear effect on function (2 trials) (SOE: low for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, there was insufficient evidence from two trials to determine effects of cognitive therapy versus wait list control, due to inconsistency and imprecision (SOE: insufficient). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found cognitive-behavioral and other combined psychological therapy associated with greater improvements in post-treatment pain intensity compared with wait list control (5 trials, SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.22, I2=40%), but effects on function were smaller and not statistically significant (4 trials, SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.13, I2=50%) (SOE: low for pain and function). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.61For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found no clear differences between psychological therapies versus exercise therapy in pain intensity (2 trials) or betweenpsychological therapies plus physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone (6 trials) in painor function, though one small subsequent trial found combination therapy associated withgreater improvements in pain and function immediately after treatment (SOE: low for painand function). Ten trials found no clear differences between different psychological therapies in pain orfunction (SOE: moderate for pain and function). Harms were not well-reported, but no trial included reported any adverse events associatedwith psychological therapies (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included two high-quality systematic reviews on psychological therapies for chronic low back pain.311, 312 One review included 22 trials (6 assessed as higher quality)311 and the other included 21 trials (7 assessed as higher quality).312 Together, the two reviews included a total of 35 unique studies. Based on the systematic reviews, the APS/ACP review concluded that there was good evidence that versus no psychological therapy or wait-list control, cognitive-behavioral therapy is associated with moderate benefits, good evidence that operant therapy is associated with no effect, fair evidence that progressive relaxation is associated with substantial net benefits, and insufficient evidence to determine effects of biofeedback. Neither systematic review found any differences between one type of behavioral intervention versus another. An updated version of one of the reviews 312 included in the APS/ACP review has been published (Table 10; Appendix Tables E19, F19).313 It included 28 trials relevant to this report (total n=3090, sample sizes ranged from 18 to 409). Compared with the previous version, the updated review included seven additional trials and excluded three previously included trials. The review focused on psychological therapies conducted in an office or group setting, broadly classified into respondent (10 trials), operant (7 trials), cognitive (4 trials), and cognitive-behavioral (7 trials) treatments as well as combinations thereof (8 trials). 313 Operant therapies refer to behavioral therapies that encourage healthy behaviors such as exercise and participation in usual activities, and that do not reinforce patient pain behaviors. Cognitive therapies help patients to identify and challenge maladaptive thoughts that contribute to disability and distress. Respondent therapy includes techniques such as relaxation or biofeedback, and is based on the premise that the physiological response to pain is linked to muscle tension in a negative feedback loop, and that this cycle can be interrupted by reducing muscle tension. Twelve trials compared psychological therapies versus wait list control, seven trials compared psychological therapies versus other interventions, and 10 trials compared one psychological therapy versus another. Several trials evaluated more than one type of psychological therapy. The duration and intensity of treatments were inconsistently described; when reported they varied from 35- to 120-minute sessions over 3 to 10 weeks; one trial evaluated daily 8-hour treatments over 5 weeks. Outcomes were assessed during or at the end of treatment in 25 trials and at 3 to 24 months after treatment in 21 trials. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.62Thirteen trials were classified as being at low risk of bias (based on meeting at least 6 of the 12 Cochrane Back Review Group criteria). Common methodological shortcomings included inadequate description of randomization and allocation concealment methods, high attrition, and dissimilar cointerventions among groups. The majority of trials used an unblinded design. 313 We identified five additional trials of psychological therapies for chronic low back pain not included in the systematic review (Table 14; Appendix Tables E20; F20).314-318 One trial evaluated psychological therapy versus wait list control317 and three trials (across four publications) psychological therapies plus another noninvasive intervention versus the other intervention alone. 314-316, 318 All of the trials were rated fair quality. In general, neither patients nor care providers could be blinded, compliance to treatment was low or unreported, and some trials did not report allocation concealment methodology or use of intention-to-treat analysis. 315-318 Respondent Therapy V ersus Wait List Control Chronic Low Back Pain Two types of respondent therapy, progressive relaxation and biofeedback, were separately evaluated in the systematic review. Three small trials (total n=74 patients) in the systematic review evaluated relaxation training versus placebo or wait list control for chronic low back pain.313 All were rated high risk of bias. No information was provided regarding treatment duration except that one study offered eight 45-minute sessions. 319 Outcomes for pain and function favored treatment in all individual trials, as well as in pooled results. Progressive relaxation was superior to wait list control for post-treatment pain intensity (3 trials, mean difference 19.77 on 0 to 100 V AS, 95% CI 34 to 5.20, I2=57%) and functional status (3 trials, standardized mean difference 0.88, 95% CI 1.36 to 0.39, I2=0%). 319-321 For function, one trial reported a 0.5-point difference in favor of progressive relaxation on a 7-point function scale319 and two trials reported a 4.8 to 11.1-point difference on the 100-point Sickness Impact Profile.320, 321 Two small studies reported post-treatment depression using the 63-point Beck Depression Inventory. One study320 (n=25) found a significant effect (14.3 points) in favor of relaxation therapy while the other trial (n=35) found no difference (1.0-point difference between groups), 321 with no difference when results were pooled (2 trials, mean difference 6.80 on 0 to 63 scale, 95% CI 20 to 6.12, I2=85%).320, 321 The systematic review included four trials (3 low risk of bias) of auditory and/or visual EMG biofeedback training (plus education and breathing exercises in one study) versus wait list or placebo controls for chronic low back pain. 313 The total sample was 108 patients. When described, session durations generally lasted 45 to 60 minutes and patients were offered 8 to 15 sessions over 3 to 4 weeks. EMG biofeedback was associated with lower pain intensity at the end of treatment (3 trials, SMD 0.80, 95% CI 1.32 to 0.28, I2=0%). Although results were not statistically significant in two of the three trials, they favored treatment in all three trials by 5 to 13 points on a 100-point pain scale. 319, 322, 323 A fourth trial could not be pooled, but reported no effect of biofeedback on pain.324 There was no clear difference between biofeedback versus wait list control for function, with inconsistent results from three trials.319, 322, 324 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.63Operant Therapy Versus Wait List Control Four trials (three low risk of bias) in the systematic review compared operant therapy versus wait list control for chronic low back pain (total n=243).313 Interventions varied, but typically included behavioral therapy plus exercise, often involving spousal participation. When reported, treatments lasted 5 to 8 weeks, with sessions lasting 2 to 8 hours per day. Operant therapy was associated with lower pain intensity at the end of treatment (3 trials, standardized mean difference 0.43, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.1, I2=0%). 212, 325, 326 Results favored operant therapy in all three trials (13 points on a 0 to 100 V AS scale in one trial325 or 3.3 to 3.6 points on the 78-point McGill Pain Questionnaire in two trials,212, 326 though the difference was statistically significant in only one325 of the trials. There was no difference between operant therapy versus wait list control for function at the end of treatment as measured by the Sickness Impact Profile (2 trials, mean difference 1.18 on a 100-point scale, 95% CI 3.53, 1.18, I2=0%). 212, 326 Operant therapy also had no effect on depression, based on two trials.212, 325 Cognitive Therapy V ersus Wait List Control Two small trials (34 patients in each study) in the systematic review evaluated cognitive therapy versus wait list control for chronic low back pain.313 In one trial, cognitive therapy consisted of graded exposure to fearful activities plus psychological education over 13 sessions in addition to usual care; 327 treatment details were not reported for the other trial.321 There was no clear difference between cognitive therapy versus wait list control in pain, though there was inconsistency between trials. One trial reported an 11-point difference on a 100-point V AS and the other reported a 0-point difference. 321, 327 There was also no difference between cognitive therapy versus wait list control for function (one trial reported a 1.6-point difference in the 100-point Sickness Impact Profile and the other reported a 1.4-point difference in the Activities of Daily Living Scale). One other larger (n=156) fair-quality trial not included in the systematic review found cognitive therapy consisting of ten to fourteen 60-minute individual sessions over 18 weeks to associated with greater improvement in activity-specific pain versus wait list control (mean improvement from baseline 19.1 vs. 5.2 on the 0 to 100 Patient Specific Complaints outcome measure, p=0.018), and increased likelihood of experiencing an 18- to 24-point improvement at the end of treatment (49% vs. 26%, odds ratio 2.77, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.01).317 However, there was no effect on function as measured by the 100-point Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (36.7 vs. 38.7). Cognitive-Behavioral and Other Combined Psychological Therapies V ersus Wait List Control Five trials (total sample 239 patients) in the systematic review evaluated combined psychological therapies versus wait list control for chronic low back pain.313 Three trials were assessed as being at low risk of bias. Combined psychological therapy interventions varied and included education, problem solving training, coping techniques, imagery, relaxation, goal setting, cognitive pain control, and exercises. Three of the trials described these interventions as being cognitive-behavioral in nature. 209, 320, 322 When reported, sessions lasted 1 to 2 hours, with 8 to 30 sessions given over 4 to 10 weeks.

Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.64Combined psychological therapy was associated with greater improvements in post-treatment pain intensity compared with wait list control (5 trials, SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.22, I2=40%).209, 320-322, 326 Effects were statistically significant in two209, 320 trials and favored treatment in the other three. Specifically, two high risk of bias trials (n=22 and 39) reported a 3.8 to a 40.5-point difference between groups on a 100-point V AS pain scale; 320, 321 one low risk of bias trial (n=45) found a 6.2-point difference between treatment groups in the 78-point McGill Pain Questionnaire; 326 and two low risk of bias trials (n=28 and 105) reported a 7.2 to 14.8-point difference in pain outcomes (scale not reported).209, 322 There was no difference between combined psychological therapy versus wait list control in function at the end of treatment (4 trials, SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.13, I2=50%). 320-322, 326 Although one small (n=22) trial at high risk of bias found combined psychological therapy associated with better Sickness Impact Profile Score versus wait list control by about 10 points, 320 the remaining three trials (n=28 to 45) found no differences.321, 322, 326 There was also no difference between combined psychological therapies versus wait list control on the Beck Depression Inventory (4 trials, SMD 1.92, 95% CI 6.2 to 2.3, I2=70%), 209, 320-322 with only one small (n=22) trial showing an effect that favored treatment.320 Psychological Therapy V ersus Usual Care Two high risk of bias trials in the systematic review compared behavioral therapy versus usual care.313 One trial (n=100) compared 6 weeks of progressive muscle relaxation versus usual care (not otherwise described)328 and the other (n=230) compared four sessions of cognitive therapy which addressed fears and encouraged exercise and activities versus usual care (pain medications, primary care visits, and other services such as physical therapy). 329 While behavioral therapy was associated with greater improvements in V AS pain scores versus usual care at the end of therapy (2 trials, mean difference 5.2 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 9.8 to 0.6, I2=20%), there was no difference at 6-month followup (2 trials, mean difference 4.3, 95% CI 9.3 to 0.7, I2=0%). 328, 329 There were no differences in functional status (based on the ODI or the RDQ) at the end of therapy or at 6-month followup in either trial or when results were pooled (2 trials, SMD 0.20 at end of treatment, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.02, I2=0% and SMD 0.12 at 6 months, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.1, I2=0%), though results slightly favored behavioral therapy. 328, 329 Psychological Therapy V ersus Other Noninvasive Treatments Five trials included in the systematic review209, 212, 330-332 evaluated psychological therapy versus other noninvasive treatments. The types of psychological therapies and comparator interventions varied across trials. Two trials (one low risk of bias) compared behavioral therapy versus group exercise. 313 One low risk of bias trial (n=107) compared cognitive behavioral therapy with strength and aerobic physical training; both interventions were given for 3 sessions per week for 10 weeks 209 and one smaller (n=39), high risk of bias trial compared operant conditioning (2 hours per week) versus group aerobic exercise (10 to 20 minutes per day, 5 days per week) for 8 weeks. 212 There were no differences in pain intensity as measured by the Pain Rating Index (0-45) at the end of treatment (2 trials, mean difference 2.31, 95% CI 6.3 to 1.7, I2=0%) or at 12 months (2 trials, N=136, mean difference 0.14, 95% CI 4.4 to 4.7, I2=0%). Similarly, there were no differences in depression at the end of therapy at any time point measured through 12 months in either study or when results were pooled. 209, 212 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.65One high risk of bias trial (n=114) in the systematic review found behavioral therapy (intensive group training via 30 sessions consisting of exercise therapy, back school, and behavioral principles) associated with significantly lower pain at 6 months versus guideline-based care (approximately 13 sessions, though the number varied), although these differences were no longer statistically significant at 12 months (data not reported). 332 There were no differences among groups in functional status at 6 or 12 months. One small (n=36), high risk of bias trial included in the systematic review found no differences between ten 35-minute sessions of progressive relaxation or biofeedback training versus back education in pain (V AS and McGill Pain Questionnaire) at the end of treatment or at 3-month followup. 330 One small (n=15), high risk of bias trial included in the systematic review found no differences between eight weekly 50-minute sessions of progressive relaxation versus self-hypnosis in V AS pain and depression at the end of therapy or at 3-month followup. 331 Psychological Therapy Plus Another Intervention V ersus the Other Intervention Alone Nine trials evaluated the effects of adding psychological therapy to another noninvasive intervention, versus the other intervention alone. Five trials (n=20 to 116)209, 212, 333-335 in the systematic review313 compared psychological therapy plus physiotherapy or exercise therapy versus physiotherapy or exercise therapy alone. There were no differences in pain, function, or depression when measured at the end of treatment or through 4 to 6 months. Results were consistent across trials, including one low risk of bias trial. 209 The systematic review also found no differences between psychological therapy plus inpatient rehabilitation versus inpatient rehabilitation alone, based on one low risk of bias (n=30) 336 and two high risk of bias (n=45 and 409)337, 338 trials.313 One low risk of bias trial (n=234) in the systematic review found the additional of cognitive-behavioral therapy program to an educational intervention associated with a small, nonstatistically significant effect on pain and functional outcomes versus the educational intervention alone measured immediately after the treatment. 339 Three fair-quality trials not included in the systematic review also evaluated the effects of combining psychological therapies with another noninvasive intervention.314-316, 318 One trial (n=88) found the addition of motivational enhancement to physical therapy (ten 30-minute sessions over 8 weeks) associated with no significant differences in pain, function, or quality of life versus physical therapy alone at 1 month. 318 In contrast, another trial (n=54) reported the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy to physical-therapist guided exercise (three sessions per week over 12 weeks plus exercise at home twice a day five times per week) resulted in significantly better pain and RDQ scores post-treatment than physical-therapist guided exercise alone. 314 Another trial (n=701) found the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy to active management advisory consult (one 15-minute session in which advice was given to remain active and use pain medication) associated with greater improvement in pain scores, the RDQ, and EQ-5D through 12-month followup, though effects on pain at 34 months were smaller and no longer statistically significant at 34 months. 315, 316 Through 12 months, differences in pain scores were Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.66about 5 to 8 points and differences on the RDQ 1.0 to 1.5 points (effect sustained through 34 months). Comparisons of Different Psychological Therapies Ten trials in the systematic review compared one psychological therapy versus another for chronic low back pain.313 Sample sizes ranged from 16 to 90 patients. In general, trials found no differences among psychological therapies in pain or function; some trials also found no effect on measures of depression. However, methodological shortcomings in most trials (5 were rated low risk of bias), small numbers of trials for each comparison, and variability in the psychological therapy interventions evaluated within comparisons precluded strong conclusions. Four trials compared various combinations of psychological therapies (e.g., operant and respondent therapy, operant and cognitive with or without group education) versus operant therapy, 326, 334, 340, 341 four trials compared various combinations of psychological therapies versus respondent therapy,320-322, 342 one trial compared different types of respondent therapy (EMG biofeedback vs. progressive relaxation),330 two trials compared cognitive therapy versus operant therapy,334, 343 one trial compared cognitive therapy versus respondent therapy (progressive muscle relaxation), and two trials compared combined psychological therapy versus cognitive therapy. 321, 334 Based on pooled estimates, there were no differences between combined psychological therapies and operant therapy in pain or function. There were also no differences between combined psychological therapies and respondent therapy for pain or function. Although respondent therapy was associated with better outcomes on the Beck Depression Inventory versus combined therapy at the end of treatment (3 trials, mean difference 2.89 on 0 to 63 scale, 95% CI 0.6 to 5.2, I2=0%), 320-322 the effect was smaller and no longer statistically significant at 6 months (2 trials, mean difference on 0-63 scale 1.84, 95% CI 0.4 to 4.1, I2=28%),321, 322 with no differences at either time point in one low risk of bias trial.322 Harms None of the trials included in the systematic review or subsequent trials reported any adverse events associated with psychological therapies. Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation Key Points For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found multidisciplinary rehabilitation,versus usual care, associated with lower short-term pain intensity (9 trials, standardizedmean difference 0.55, 95% CI to mean differenceon a 0- to 10-point numerical rating scale) and disability (9 trials, standardized meandifference 0.41, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.19, I2=58%; or ~2.5-point mean difference on theRDQ); effects on long-term pain intensity and disability also favored multidisciplinaryrehabilitation, but were smaller (7 trials, standard mean difference 0.21, 95% CI 0.37 to0.04, I2=25% and 6 trials, standardized mean difference 0.23, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.06,I2=19%, respectively), with no difference in likelihood of return to work (7 trials, OR 1.04,95% CI 0.73 to 1.47, I2=31%) (SOE: moderate for pain and function). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.67For chronic low back pain a systematic review found multidisciplinary rehabilitation, versus no multidisciplinary rehabilitation, associated with lower short-term pain intensity(3 trials, standardized mean difference 0.73, 95% CI 1.22 to 0.24, I2=64%, or~1.7-point mean difference on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale) and disability (3 trials,pooled standardized mean difference 0.49, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.22, I2=0%, or ~2.9-pointmean difference on the RDQ); there was insufficient evidence to assess effects on long-term outcomes (SOE: low for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found multidisciplinary rehabilitation,versus nonmultidisciplinary physical therapy, associated with lower short-term painintensity (12 trials, standardized mean difference 0.30, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.06, I2=80%,or an approximate 0.6-point mean difference on a 0- to 10-point numerical rating scale) anddisability (13 trials, standardized mean difference 0.39, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.10, I2=88%,or an approximate 1.2-point mean difference on the RDQ); multidisciplinary rehabilitationwas also associated with lower long-term pain intensity (9 trials, standardized meandifference 0.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 0.01, I2=92%) and function (10 trials, standardizedmean difference 0.68, 95% CI 1.19 to 0.16, I2=94%) and greater likelihood for returnto work (8 trials, OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.53, I2=0%) (SOE: moderate). No study evaluated the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for acute low backpain or for radicular low back pain. Harms were poorly reported in trials of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, though no seriousharms were reported (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis Multidisciplinary rehabilitation, also known as interdisciplinary rehabilitation, refers to a coordinated program with both physical and biopsychosocial treatment components (at minimum) and is provided by professionals from at least two different specialties (e.g., physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, physicians, and/or complementary and alternative medicine providers). The previous APS/ACP review 29 identified three systematic reviews of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for chronic low back pain (>3 months duration) and one trial of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for subacute (>4 weeks and <3 months duration) low back pain. 344-347 The systematic reviews were all rated high quality and included 20 unique trials. Based on the systematic reviews, the APS/ACP review concluded that there was good evidence that multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions for chronic low back pain are moderately more effective than usual care or no multidisciplinary intervention at reducing pain and improving function, including return to work. 344-347 We identified a subsequent good-quality systematic review of multidisciplinary rehabilitation that included 41 trials of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) for chronic (>12 weeks) mechanical or nonspecific low back pain (Table 10; Appendix Tables E21; F21). 348 Thirty-one of the trials were published after the APS/ACP review. The trials in the systematic review enrolled a total of 6,858 subjects (sample size range 20 to 542) from Europe, Iran, North America, and Australia. Sixteen trials compared MBR versus usual care; 4 trials MBR versus wait list controls; 19 trials MBR versus physical treatments (exercise plus Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.68other modalities like back school, massage, traction, and stretching); and 12 trials compared different multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions versus one other. Trials of MBR versus surgery were included in the systematic review but outside the scope of this report. Fifteen of the MBR interventions were categorized as high-level interventions (>100 hours total and delivered on a daily basis), 15 involved low-level interventions (<30 hours and nondaily), and 11 interventions did not meet criteria for either high- or low-level interventions. Primary outcomes of pain, disability, and work were organized into short-term outcomes (<3 months), medium term-outcomes (3-12 months), and long-term outcomes (>12 months). All of the studies had methodological shortcomings, but 13 trials were assessed by the review as low risk of bias, based on meeting 6 of 12 Cochrane Back Review criteria. No trial blinded providers or participants; other methodological shortcomings included failure to describe adequate randomization methods (12 trials) and failure to report intention to treat analysis (25 trials). We identified three additional trials of multidisciplinary rehabilitation that were not included in the systematic review (Table 15; Appendix Tables E22, F22). 349-351 Two trials evaluated for subacute (<12 weeks duration) low back pain.349, 350 One good-quality trial (n=20) compared a low-intensity multidisciplinary program consisting of physician evaluation, acupuncture, chiropractic care, massage, occupational therapy, physical therapy, nutrition counseling, and as-needed psychiatric and rheumatology consults versus usual care. 349 A fair-quality trial (n=70) compared a high-intensity (>100 total hours) multidisciplinary rehabilitation program including physician evaluation, physical therapy, biofeedback/pain management, group didactic sessions, case management/occupational therapy sessions, and interdisciplinary team conference for patients at high risk for chronic disabling low back pain versus usual care.350 A third, good-quality trial (n=20) evaluated multidisciplinary rehabilitation (including exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy) versus usual care (including passive spinal mobilization and exercise) for chronic low back pain. 351 Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation V ersus Usual Care Chronic Low Back Pain For chronic low back pain, the systematic review found multidisciplinary rehabilitation associated with lower pain intensity versus usual care in the short term (less than 3 months) (9 trials, standardized mean difference 0.55, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.28, I2=72%; ~1.4-point mean difference on a 0- to 10-point numerical rating scale). 348 Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was also associated with better short-term disability (9 trials, standardized mean difference 0.41, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.19, I2=58%; ~2.5-point mean difference on the RDQ). Statistical heterogeneity was present in pooled analyses. Restricting analyses to high-quality trials resulted in similar pooled estimates, though results were less precise and differences no longer statistically significant. There was substantial overlap in CIs for pooled estimates when results were stratified according to use of high versus low intensity MBR interventions. Only one trial enrolled patients with high baseline pain and disability intensity, precluding reliable conclusions regarding effects of baseline symptom intensity on estimates of effectiveness. No difference was seen in the proportion of patients working in the short term, based on two trials (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.90, I2=0%). The odds ratios for return to work in the two included studies were 0.91 and 1.14.329, 352 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.69The systematic review also found multidisciplinary rehabilitation associated with small beneficial effects on long-term back pain versus usual care (7 trials, standard mean difference 0.21, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.04, I2=25%; ~0.5-point mean difference on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale). Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was also associated with beneficial effects on long-term functional outcomes (6 trials, standardized mean difference 0.23, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.06, I2=19%; ~1.4-point mean difference on the RDQ). There was no difference between multidisciplinary rehabilitation versus usual care in the likelihood of return to work long-term (7 trials, OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.47, I2=31%). In the included trials, odds ratios for return to work ranged from 0.48 to 2.77. The systematic review found multidisciplinary rehabilitation associated with better short- term scores on the SF-36 mental component subscale (mean difference 15.25, 95% CI 2.05 to 28.44, I2=73%), with no effect on the SF-36 physical component (mean difference 13.45, 95% CI 9.07 to 35.96, I2=94%). 353, 354 However, estimates were based on only two trials with heterogeneous results (mean differences 9.4 [95% CI 2.7 to 16] and 23 [95% CI 11 to 35] on the mental component subscale and 2.5 [95% CI 1.4 to 6.4] and 26 [95% CI 15 to 36] on the physical component subscale). Two trials evaluated multidisciplinary rehabilitation versus usual care for subacute low back pain. One trial (n=20) found MBR associated with better pain (mean 1.0 vs. 4.7) and SF-12 Physical Component Subscale scores (mean 51 vs. 44, p=0.03) through 26 weeks. 349 Effects on the RDQ favored MBR at 12 weeks (3.9 vs. 11, p=0.08), but did not reach statistical significance. The second trial (n=70) found multidisciplinary rehabilitation associated with long-term (12 months) improvement in pain based on the Characteristic Pain Inventory (27 vs. 43 on a 0- to 100-point scale, p=0.001), disability days (38 vs. 102, p=0.001), return to work (91% vs. 69%, OR 4.55, of costs ($12,721 vs. $21,843, p<0.05) in patients at high risk for chronic disabling low back pain.350 Both trials found no differences in days in bed, days of work or school missed, and days that activity levels were reduced. Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation V ersus No Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation Chronic Low Back Pain The systematic review found multidisciplinary rehabilitation associated with lower short-term pain intensity versus no multidisciplinary rehabilitation (3 trials, standardized mean difference 0.73, 95% CI 1.22 to 0.24, I2=64%; ~1.7-point mean differences on a 0 to 10 NRS). 348 Although statistical heterogeneity was present, results from all trials favored multidisciplinary rehabilitation (standardized mean differences of 0.45, 0.55, and 1.20). Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was also associated with improved short-term disability (3 trials, pooled standardized mean difference 0.49, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.22, I2=0%; ~2.9-point difference on the RDQ). There was insufficient evidence to assess effects on long-term outcomes. Work-related outcomes were also not reported. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.70Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation V ersus Physical Therapy Chronic Low Back Pain The systematic review found multidisciplinary rehabilitation associated with lower short- term pain intensity versus physical therapy (12 trials, standardized mean difference 0.30, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.06, I2=80%; a 0- to 10-point NRS).348 Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was also associated with better short-term disability (13 trials, standardized mean difference 0.39, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.10, I2=88%; ~1.2-point mean difference on the RDQ). Statistical heterogeneity was present for both short-term pain and function, with 5 trials finding no effect on short-term pain or disability. Exclusion of high risk of bias trials and stratification by intensity of the multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention resulted in pooled estimates that also favored multidisciplinary rehabilitation, though results were less precise and in some cases no longer statistically significant. Excluding an outlier trial with large effect sizes (e.g., 1.99 for pain vs. 0.04 to 0.65 in the other trials) eliminated statistical heterogeneity for pain and reduced statistical heterogeneity for function, and resulted in similar pooled estimates. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was also associated with increased likelihood of working versus physical therapy at short term (3 trials, OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.78, I2=23%), though only one of the included trials reported a positive effect (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.5, versus OR 1.1 in the other two trials). 355 The systematic review also found multidisciplinary rehabilitation associated with lower long-term pain intensity versus physical therapy (9 trials, standardized mean difference 0.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 0.01, I2=92%; ~1.2-point mean difference on a 0 to 10 NRS). Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was also associated with better long-term function (10 trials, standardized mean difference 0.68, 95% CI 1.19 to 0.16, I2=94%; ~4.0-point difference on the RDQ). Excluding an outlier trial with very large effects in favor of multidisciplinary rehabilitation resulted in a similar pooled estimate that was no longer statistically significant. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was associated with greater likelihood versus physical therapy for return to work (8 trials, OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.53, I2=0%). Three trials found no differences between multidisciplinary rehabilitation versus physical therapy in the short or long term for quality of life measures 209, 338, 356-358 and seven trials found no differences in short- or long-term depression or anxiety, or self-efficacy.209, 212, 334, 335, 338, 356-359 One subsequent small (n=20), good-quality trial reported results consistent with the systematic review.351 Harms Harms were poorly reported in trials of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, though no serious harms were reported. One trial reported no adverse events in subjects who underwent multidisciplinary rehabilitation 360 and one trial reported one case of pain due to acupuncture.349 One trial reported three cases of transitory worsening of pain and one case of mood alteration in patients undergoing multidisciplinary rehabilitation.

Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.71Acupuncture Key Points For acute low back pain, a systematic review found acupuncture associated with lower pain intensity versus sham acupuncture using nonpenetrating needles (2 trials, mean difference9.38 on a 0 to 100 V AS, 95% CI 1.76 to 17.0, I2=27%); three other trials reported effectsconsistent with these findings. One trial of sham acupuncture using penetrating needles tononacupuncture points found no effect on pain. These were no clear effects on function in 5trials (SOE: low for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found acupuncture associated withlower pain intensity versus sham acupuncture (superficial needling at acupuncture ornonacupuncture points, or nonpenetrating pressure at acupuncture points) immediately atthe end of treatment (4 trials, WMD 16.76, 95% CI 33.3 to 0.19, I2=90%) and at upto 12 weeks (3 trials, WMD 9.55, 95% CI 16.5 to 2.58, I2=40%), but there were nodifferences in function. Four additional trials reported results consistent with these findings(SOE: moderate for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found acupuncture associated with lowerpain intensity (4 trials, SMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.94 I2=51%) and SMD 0.94, 95% CI 1.41 to 0.47, I2=78%) immediately after treatment versusno acupuncture. Mean effects on pain ranged from 7 to 24 points on a 0- to 100-pointscale; for function one trial reported a difference of 8 points on a 0- to 100-point scale andthe other two trials; two trials showed small or no clear differences at longer-term followup(SOE: moderate for pain and function). For acute low back pain, a systematic review found acupuncture associated with slightlygreater likelihood of overall improvement versus NSAIDs at the end of treatment (5 trials,RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16, I2=0%) (SOE: low). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found acupuncture associated with betterpain relief (3 trials, WMD 10.56 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 20.34 to 0.78, I2=0%)and improvement in function 0.67 to 0.04, I2=7%)immediately postintervention (SOE: low). Harms of acupuncture were poorly reported in the trials, though no serious adverse eventswere reported (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included three systematic reviews361-363 with a total of 51 unique trials of acupuncture. Four trials in the systematic reviews evaluated acupuncture for acute low back pain and the remainder evaluated acupuncture for chronic low back pain. Based on the evidence in the systematic reviews, the APS/ACP review found insufficient (poor) evidence to determine effects of acupuncture for acute low back pain and fair evidence of moderate effects of acupuncture versus sham or no acupuncture for short-term pain relief in patients with chronic Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.72low back pain, though some inconsistency was noted in trials of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture, with some trials findings no effects. We identified two fair-quality recent systematic reviews of acupuncture for low back pain; one evaluated acupuncture for acute or subacute low back pain364 and the other evaluated acupuncture for chronic low back pain (Table 10, Appendix Tables E23, F23).365 The systematic review364 on acupuncture for acute or subacute low back pain 9<12 weeks in duration) included 11 trials (9 not included in the APS/ACP review).366-374 Three trials evaluated acupuncture versus sham acupuncture (total n=148), 7 trials evaluated acupuncture versus medications including NSAIDS, muscle relaxants and analgesics (total n=966). and 1 trial compared acupuncture plus medication versus the medication alone (n=49). The acupuncture interventions ranged from a single session 371, 375 to up to 12 sessions over a 4- to 6-week period. Outcomes were assessed immediately at the end of treatment in all trials; longer-term outcomes were assessed at 1 to 6 months in three trials. 374, 376, 377 Five trials were rated low risk of bias,366, 371, 374-376 based on meeting at least 6 of 12 2009 Cochrane Back Group criteria. Methodological shortcomings in the 6 high-risk of bias trials included inadequate description of randomization and allocation concealment methods, unblinded design, and unclear similarity of the groups at baseline. Three sham-controlled trials had blinding of patients, providers and outcomes assessors. 371, 374, 375 The systematic revie w365 on acupuncture for chronic low back pain included 32 trials (9 not included in the APS/ACP review).378-385 All of the trials evaluated patients with chronic low back pain for >12 weeks, with the exception of one trial that included people with subacute (>6 weeks) to chronic low back pain (up to 52 weeks). 386 In addition to standard acupuncture needles applied to the body, other acupuncture techniques evaluated in the trials included electroacupuncture and auricular acupuncture. Seven trials evaluated acupuncture versus sham procedures (total sample=638 participants), 3 trials evaluated acupuncture versus medications (total sample=75 participants), and the other 22 trials compared acupuncture versus no acupuncture, usual care, TENS, exercise, inactive treatment, or another active treatment. The number of sessions ranged from 1 to 20, the duration of treatment ranged from 1 day (single treatment) to 12 weeks, and duration of followup ranged from immediately following treatment through up to 48 months. Seven of the trials 378-381, 383, 387, 388 were rated low risk of bias (based on meeting all 2009 Cochrane Back Review Group criteria). Methodological shortcomings in the other trials included inadequate description of randomization and allocation concealment techniques, unblinded design, and unclear similarity of groups at baseline. We identified three additional good-quality trials of acupuncture for acute 389, 390 or chronic391 low back pain (Table 16, Appendix Tables E24, F24). One trial (n=80) compared five 30-minute sessions scalp acupuncture plus diclofenac versus sham scalp acupuncture plus diclofenac for acute low back pain; outcomes were assessed at 28 days. 389 Another trial (n=270), randomized patients with acute low back pain to one of four treatment groups: true acupuncture, sham acupuncture (needles inserted at nonacupuncture points), placebo acupuncture (momentary pressure with semiblunted needle applied to back) or no acupuncture. 390 Treatments were administered in five 20-minute sessions over 2 weeks, with outcomes assessed through 48 weeks. The third trial (n=130) evaluated acupuncture versus sham acupuncture for chronic low back Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.73pain.391 Patients received 12 acupuncture or sham acupuncture sessions over a 6 week time period and were followed for up to 6 months. We also identified one fair-quality trial (n=236) of acupuncture performed at back pain specific acupoints or standard acupuncture performed at nonspecific acupoints (n=82) versus usual care. 392 Methodological limitations included unclear allocation concealment and lack of blinding of patients and providers. Patients in the acupuncture groups received 14 daily treatments and outcomes were assessed through 24 weeks. A poor-quality trial (n=143) (due to unclear randomization and allocation concealment methods, no primary outcome identified and unclear blinding) compared the addition of daily acupuncture to an intensive inpatient 21-day rehabilitation for chronic low back pain and measured outcomes at 3 months after the end of treatment. 393 Acupuncture V ersus Sham Acupuncture Acute Low Back Pain Three low risk of bias trials in the systematic review of acupuncture for acute low back pain364 evaluated acupuncture versus a sham procedure involving nonpenetrating needles to acupuncture points.371, 374, 375 Two trials (n=40 and 60) found acupuncture associated with immediate pain relief following a single treatment, though effects were small (mean difference 9.38 on a 0 to 100 V AS, 95% CI 1.76 to 17.0, I2=27%). 371, 375 The third trial (n=48) could not be pooled, but found no difference between 3 to 12 sessions of acupuncture versus sham in mean pain intensity at 3 months, though acupuncture was associated with lower scores for worst pain at 3 months (estimated marginal mean difference from baseline 18.7 on 0-100 V AS scale, 95% CI 1.5 to 36.0, p=0.034) as well as analgesic tablet use. There were no differences in function in any of the studies. One good-quality trial (n=275) not included in the systematic review found no differences between five 20-minute sessions of acupuncture, sham (nonacupuncture points), or placebo (semiblunted needles to the back) acupuncture in the likelihood of experiencing 35 percent improvement in the RDQ at 3 weeks, though the first two were associated with greater likelihood of improvement in the RDQ versus no acupuncture (74% vs. 75% vs. 65% vs. 44%, respectively, RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.24 for acupuncture versus no acupuncture and RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.28 for sham acupuncture versus no acupuncture).390 Changes in pain intensity were not reported, and there were no clear differences between groups in the proportion of patients reporting ongoing or recurring pain at 1 year. Another good-quality trial (n=80) not included in the systematic review found five 30-minute sessions of scalp acupuncture associated with lower pain intensity (mean improvement from baseline 4.57 vs. 3.30 on a 0-10 V AS, p=0.005) and function (mean improvement from baseline 10.8 vs. 6.6 on the RDQ, p=0.002) at 28 days versus sham acupuncture (nonpenetrating needles), though the magnitude of the difference was below the prespecified threshold for meaningful differences (<2 cm on the 10 cm V AS scale and <5 on the RDQ). 389 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.74Chronic Low Back Pain Seven trials in the systematic review of acupuncture for chronic low back pain evaluated acupuncture versus sham acupuncture. One trial evaluated auricular electroacupuncture versus sham electroacupuncture (needles inserted but no current) 394 and the other trials evaluated acupuncture to the body versus superficial needling at acupuncture points,388, 395 nonpenetrating pressure with a or superficial needling at nonacupuncture points.379, 397, 398 Four trials could be included in pooled analyses.388, 395-397 Acupuncture was associated with improved pain versus sham immediately at the end of treatment (4 trials, WMD 16.76, 95% CI 33.3 to 0.19, I2=90%) and at up to 12 weeks (3 trials, WMD 9.55, 95% CI 16.5 to 2.58, I2=40%), but there were no differences on function at the end of treatment (p=0.2, data not provided) or at up to 12 weeks (p=0.76). Statistical heterogeneity was substantial and was not explained by the type of sham procedure evaluated. The three trials not included in the meta analysis due to lack of poolable data, 379, 394, 398 including the trial of auricular acupuncture, reported results consistent with the meta-analysis for immediate effects. One trial that evaluated longer-term outcomes found that differences between acupuncture versus sham acupuncture were smaller and no longer statistically significant at 26 and 52 weeks. 397 One good-quality trial (n=130) published subsequent to the systematic review found acupuncture (up to 12 sessions over 6 weeks) associated with lower low back pain symptom bothersomeness scores (mean change from baseline 3.4 vs. 2.3 on 0 to 10 V AS, p<0.05) and pain intensity (3.52 vs. 2.27 on 0 to 10 V AS, p=0.008) versus sham acupuncture (semiblunt needles to nonacupuncture points) at 8 weeks, though differences were no longer present at 6-month followup. 391 There was no difference in function (ODI) at any time point through 6 months. Acupuncture V ersus No Acupuncture Chronic Low Back Pain The systematic review of acupuncture for chronic low back pain365 included five trials of acupuncture versus no acupuncture. One trial was rated low risk of bias378 and the others unclear risk of bias.384, 397, 399, 400 The systematic review found acupuncture associated with lower pain intensity (4 trials, SMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.49, I2=51%)384, 397, 399, 400 and better function (3 trials, SMD 0.94, 95% CI 1.41 to 0.47, I2=78%)378, 397, 400 immediately after treatment, versus no acupuncture. Across the trials included in the meta-analyses, mean effects on pain ranged from 7 to 24 points on a 0- to 100-point scale; for function one trial reported a difference of 8 points on the Pain Disability Index 397 and the other two trials378, 400 reported mean differences of 0.8 and 3.4 points on the RDQ. The low risk of bias trial found no clear differences between acupuncture versus self care alone in the RDQ at the end of treatment (mean 7.9 vs. 8.8, p=0.55) or at 1 year (mean 8.0 vs. 6.4, p=0.10) or in symptom bothersomeness scores (40 vs. 4.6 on a 0 to 10 scale at 10 weeks and 4.5 vs. 3.8 at 1 year, respectively). 378 Another trial also found that effects on pain and function were much larger immediately after a 12-week course of treatment (for pain, mean difference 27 [95% CI 24 to 21] on a 0- to 100-point scale at 3 months and 2.7 [95% CI 0.3 to 5.7] at 6 months; for function, mean difference 22 points [95% CI 95% CI 19 to 25] on the 0 to 100 Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire at 3 months and 3.7 points [95%CI 0.7 to 6.7] at 6 months). 384 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.75Acupuncture V ersus Medications Acute Low Back Pain Five trials366-369, 373 in the systematic review of acupuncture for acute low back pain364 found acupuncture associated with slightly greater likelihood of overall improvement versus NSAIDs at the end of treatment (5 trials, RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16, I2=0%). However, there was no significant difference when the analysis was restricted to two trials rated low risk of bias (pooled RR, 1.14; 95% CI 0.99, 1.30; I2=49%), although the point estimate was similar to the overall analysis and each trial reported results that favored acupuncture versus meloxicam (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11) 369 or versus ibuprofen (94% vs. 75% \"cured\", p<0.05).366 The three high risk of bias trials reported inconsistent effects of acupuncture versus medications on pain intensity. One trial favored acupuncture over ibuprofen 368 immediately following each treatment, but two other trials found no significant differences between acupuncture versus naproxen377 or diclofenac.372 Chronic Low Back Pain Three trials in a systematic review of acupuncture for chronic low back pain365 compared acupuncture versus medications (NSAIDs, muscle relaxants and analgesics).400-402 Two of the trials were rated high risk of bias401, 402 and the other unclear risk of bias.400 Compared with medications, acupuncture was associated with better pain relief (WMD 10.56 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 20.34 0.78, I2=0%) I2=7%) immediately postintervention. Acupuncture Plus Medications V ersus the Medication Alone Acute Low Back Pain Two high risk of bias trials in the systematic review compared acupuncture plus medications versus the medication alone.372, 373 One trial (n=200) found 7 days of acupuncture plus nimesulide (an NSAID) associated with better short-term overall improvement the NSAID alone.373 The other trial (n=69) found five sessions of acupuncture plus diclofenac associated with greater short-term improvements in pain and function versus diclofenac alone at the end of treatment. 372 Harms Harms of acupuncture were poorly reported in the trials. Serious adverse events were not reported in any trial. In three trials, the most commonly reported adverse effects in people receiving acupuncture were gastrointestinal problems, changes in energy, 377 mild bleeding at the needling site,371 and temporarily increased low back pain.391 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.76Massage Key Points For subacute low back pain, a systematic review included two trials that found massage associated with greater short-term (1 week) improvement in pain (SMD 0.92, 95% CI1.35 to 0.48) and function (SMD 1.76, 95% CI 3.19 to 0.32) versus sham therapy,but there was no difference in pain or function at 5 weeks in one trial (SOE: low for painand function). For chronic low back pain, one trial found no difference between foot reflexology versus usual care in pain or function, and one trial found structural or relaxation massage associated with better function (mean 2.5 to 2.9 points on the RDQ) versus usual care at 10 weeks; effects were less pronounced at 52 weeks (SOE: low for pain and function). For subacute to chronic low back pain, a systematic review found massage associated with better effects on short-term pain in 7 of 9 trials (mean differences 0.6 to 0.94 points on a 0 to 10 scale) and better effects on short-term function in 3 of 4 trials (SOE: moderate for pain and function). For subacute to chronic low back pain, a systematic review included 5 trials that generally found massage plus another intervention superior to the other intervention without massage for short-term pain, with effects somewhat stronger in trials in which massage was combined with exercise; few differences were observed for function or long-term pain. Two subsequent trials of massage plus exercise reported findings generally consistent with these findings (SOE: low). Comparisons of difference massage techniques were too heterogeneous and effects were too small from six trials to determine effects on pain and function (SOE: insufficient). Harms were not well-reported in trials of massage, though no serious adverse events were reported; two trials reported soreness during or shortly after the treatment (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included two good-quality systematic reviews with a total of eight unique trials of massage.403, 404 Five of the trials were rated higher quality. Based on the systematic reviews, the APS/ACP review concluded that there was fair evidence of moderate net benefits of massage for chronic or subacute low back pain. One of the systematic reviews 404 has been updated to include 13 trials (total n=1596, range 39 to 262) (Table 10; Appendix Tables E25, F25).405 The trials evaluated massage for acute (1 RCT), subacute (4 RCTs) and chronic low back pain (8 RCTs). Massage techniques were variable, and included traditional Thai massage, Swedish massage, relaxation massage methods, acupuncture massage, muscle energy technique, roptrotherapy, acupressure, foot reflexology, or combined techniques. Two trials compared massage versus sham/placebo massage, nine trials of massage versus other treatments (manipulation, exercise, relaxation, acupuncture, physiotherapy and self- Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.77care education), five trials of massage versus other interventions versus the other interventions alone, and two trials compared different massage techniques. The number of sessions, duration of sessions, and duration of treatment varied. Two of the studies included were single intervention trials; in the remainder the duration of treatment ranged from three to 10 weeks. The duration of followup ranged from immediately following treatment to 52 weeks post randomization. Six trials were rated low risk of bias (based on meeting 6 of 11 Cochrane Back Review group criteria). Methodological shortcomings included lack of blinding of patients and assessors and inadequate or unclearly described allocation concealment methods. We identified eight additional trials of massage not included in the systematic review. 406-413 One good-quality trial (n=401) evaluated two different types of massage (structural or relaxation) versus usual care for chronic low back pain (Table 17; Appendix Tables E26, F26). 406 Patients randomized to massage received 10 weekly treatments including up to 3 home exercises from a predefined list of seven exercises, six of which were common to both treatments, as well as stretching. The relaxation massage group was also given 2.5-minute home relaxation exercises. A fair-quality trial (n=45) compared acupressure massage versus sham laser or no treatment. 412 Three smaller trials (n=26 to 140) not compared different massage techniques with one another. One trial was rated as good quality, 407 one fair,409 and one poor quality.408 Two fair-quality trials compared massage plus an exercise intervention to the exercise intervention alone.411, 413 One of these trials trial (n=80)411 evaluated myofascial release for subacute to chronic low back pain and the other413 evaluated Chinese massage for back pain of mixed duration. The eighth, fair-quality trial (n=32) compared massage plus traction versus traction alone in patients with chronic low back pain. 410 Methodological shortcomings in the fair- and poor-quality trials included unclear randomization and allocation concealment methods, baseline group differences, and inadequate or unclear blinding. Massage V ersus Sham Intervention or No Massage Subacute Low Back Pain The updated systematic review included two trials of massage versus sham therapy for subacute low back pain.414, 415 One low risk of bias trial (n=98) included in the prior APS/ACP review found massage moderately superior to sham laser for short- and long-term pain intensity and functional status. 414 Effects of pain ranged from about 0.8 to 1.3 points on a 10-point pain scale (p<0.001) and from 1.2 to 4 points on the RDQ (p<0.001). Another, high risk of bias trial (n=60) 415 compared one 30-minute session of deep cross-friction massage with the aid of a copper myofascial T -bar (roptrotherapy) applied to the lumbar pelvic region versus no massage to patients with subacute low back pain (>3 weeks and <12 weeks). In this trial, roptrotherapy was associated with less pain and improved function at 1 week compared with either no treatment or a placebo intervention (endemiology as a massage-like treatment). Mean differences in change from baseline were about 20 points for pain on a 0 to 100 scale and about 20 points on the ODI. In a pooled analysis, massage was associated with greater short-term (1 week) improvement in pain (SMD 0.92, 95% CI 1.35 to 0.48) as well as back-specific function (SMD 1.76, 95% CI 3.19 to 0.32).414, 415 However, one trial that evaluated longer-term outcomes found no statistically significant effects on pain and back-related function at 5 weeks. 415 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.78One additional fair-quality trial (n=45) found massage associated with decreased low back pain versus sham laser or no treatment at 6 weeks (0.9 vs. 4.7 vs. 5.9 on a 0 to 10 scale, respectively), but there were differences in baseline pain scores (6.4 vs. 5.7 vs. 5.0).412 Massage V ersus Usual Care Chronic Low Back Pain One low risk of bias trial (n=243) included in the systematic review found no differences between foot reflexology versus usual care in short- or long-term pain or function.328 A recent, good quality, larger (n=401) trial406 not included in the systematic review found a 10-week course of structural or relaxation massage for chronic low back pain each associated with better RDQ scores versus usual care (differences 2.5 to 2.9 points on a 0- to 24-point scale) and better symptom bothersomeness scores (differences 1.4 and 1.7 points) at 10 weeks. Beneficial effects on function, but not symptom bothersomeness, remained present at 52 weeks for relaxation massage (but not structural massage) versus usual care, but were less pronounced (mean difference in RDQ 1.4, 95% CI 2.6 to 0.2). Massage V ersus Other Treatments The systematic review included eight trials (5 published since the APS/ACP review) of massage other noninvasive active treatments. Massage was compared versus manipulation (1 trial), 416 exercise therapy (1 trial),414 relaxation therapy (3 trials),328, 417, 418 acupuncture (1 trial),403 or physiotherapy (2 trials).419, 420 All of the trials evaluated patients with subacute to chronic low back pain. Most trials found massage superior to other treatments for short-term pain, but findings were limited by small samples, small numbers of trials for each comparison, heterogeneous massage and comparator intervention techniques, and methodological limitations in the trials. For short-term pain, results favored massage in 7 of the nine trials, though effects were small (mean differences less than 1 point on a 0 to 10 scale, range 0.6 to 0.94). The largest effect was observed in a low risk of bias trial (n=67) that found Thai massage associated with less pain versus joint mobilization 5 minutes after treatment (mean difference 0.94,95% CI 1.76 to 0.12) for chronic low back pain. 416 The largest trial (n=243) found no differences between reflexology versus progressive muscle relaxation in pain (mean difference 2.90, 95% CI 12.32 to 6.52) or function (3.60, 95% CI 11.10 to 3.90) immediately post-treatment or at 6 months. 328 Other trials found massage associated with better scores on the RDQ versus acupuncture at the end of a 10-week course of treatment (n=172, mean difference in change from baseline 0.6 points, p=0.01), with similar effects at 1 year 403 versus exercise 1 month after a 1-month course of treatment (n=47, mean difference in change from baseline 4.2 points, p<0.05); 414 or versus a physical therapy intervention (including exercise, manipulation, and physical modalities) at the end of a 1-month course of treatment (n=129, mean difference 4.6, 95% CI 6.4 to 2.9) through 6-month followup. 419 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.79Massage Plus Another Intervention V ersus the Other Intervention Without Massage Five trials included in the systematic review compared massage plus another intervention (exercise [2 trials],414, 421 exercise and education [1 trial],422 or usual care [2 trials]328, 423) versus the other intervention without massage; three of these trials328, 422, 423 were not in the prior APS/ ACP review. Three trials were assessed as being at low risk of bias.328, 414, 421 The two studies that included usual care interventions either did not define usual care423 or included a broad range of possible treatments including no treatment, medications, physical therapy, herbal remedies and aromatherapy. 328 Only one trial included patients with subacute low back pain;423 the rest included patients with subacute to chronic low back pain. The trials generally found massage plus another intervention to be superior to the treatments without massage for short-term pain, but findings were limited by small samples, few trials for each comparison, evaluation of heterogeneous massage techniques and comparator interventions, and methodological limitations in the trials. Few differences were observed for function or long-term pain. The improvement in short-term pain appeared somewhat stronger in the 3 trials in which massage was combined with either group or individual exercise. 414, 421, 422 One subsequent, fair-quality trial (n=32) found massage (twice weekly 20 minute sessions) plus traction for three weeks and 32 associated with no clear effects versus traction alone in pain immediately following treatment (mean 1.9 vs. 1.4 on a 0 to 10 scale); function was not reported. 410 Two other fair-quality trials (n=80 and 90) not included in the systematic review found massage plus an exercise intervention associated with small to moderate effects on short-term pain (mean difference of about 5 point on the McGill Pain Questionnaire or 1.4 on a 0 to 10 point V AS) and function (about 3 points on the 0 to 100 point Quebec Back Pain Disability Questionnaire or about 5 point on the ODI) versus the exercise intervention alone. 411, 413 Comparisons of Different Types of Massage Six trials compared different types of massage;406-409, 421, 424 two of these421, 424 were included in the systematic review.405 The massage techniques that were compared varied. Although most trials found statistically significant differences among methods, effects were small. One low risk of bias trial (n=190) found acupuncture massage superior to Swedish massage for short-term pain (mean difference about 0.8 on a 0 to 10 V AS) and function (mean difference about 7 points on the 0 to 100 Hanover Function Score Questionnaire). 421 Another trial (n=268 for comparison of massage techniques) found no differences between structural versus relaxation massage on the RDQ (mean difference about 0.4 points) or symptom bothersomeness scores (mean difference about 0.3 points on a 0 to 10 scale). 406 Other, smaller (n=26 to 140) trials also found small differences that favored Chinese massage with oils vs. standard massage,407 Swedish massage with oils versus Thai massage,409 traditional Thai versus Swedish massage424 and deep tissue versus standard massage.408 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.80Harms Harms were not well-reported in trials of massage, though no serious adverse events were reported. In two trials that reported adverse events,420, 424 soreness was noted during or shortly after the treatment. Some patients also reported a skin reaction (e.g., rash or pimples) in trials that used massage oil. Spinal Manipulation Key Points For acute low back pain, two trials (one included in a systematic review) found spinalmanipulation associated with better effects on function versus sham manipulation(statistically significant in one trial); in one trial effects on pain favored manipulation butwere small and not statistically significant (mean difference 0.50, 95% CI 1.39 to 0.39)(SOE: low for function, insufficient for pain). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found spinal manipulation associated withsmall, statistically nonsignificant effects versus sham manipulation on pain at 1 month (3trials, WMD 3.24, 95% CI 13.62 to 7.15 on a 0 to 100 scale, I2=53%); one trial reportedsimilar results for function (SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.06); one trial not included inthe systematic review reported generally consistent results (SOE: low for pain, insufficientfor function). For acute low back pain, a systematic review found no differences between spinalmanipulation versus and inert treatment in pain relief at 1 week (3 trials, WMD 0.14 ona 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.96, I2=27%), though one trial found SMT associatedwith better longer-term pain relief (MD 1.20 at 3 months, 95% CI 2.11 to 0.29); therewere no differences in function at 1 week (2 trials, SMD 0.08, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.21,I2=0%) or at 3 months (1 trial, SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.02) (SOE: low for pain andfunction). For chronic low back pain, one high-quality trial found spinal manipulation associated withgreater improvement in the \"main complaint\" versus an inert treatment (mean difference0.9 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.7); results from three low risk of bias trials and threeadditional trials not included in the systematic review were somewhat inconsistent, thoughsome trials reported effects that favored manipulation (SOE: low). For acute low back pain, a systematic review found no difference between spinalmanipulation versus other active interventions in pain relief at 1 week (3 trials, WMD0.06 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.65, I2=0%), 1 month (3 trials, WMD 0.15,95% CI 0.49 to 0.18, I2=0%), 3 to 6 months (2 trials, WMD0.20, 95%CI 1.13 to 0.73,I2=81%), or 1 year (1 trial, MD 0.40, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.88). Findings were similar forfunction, with no differences observed at any time point. A subsequent trial of patientswith acute or subacute low back pain found spinal manipulation associated with moderateeffects versus usual care on pain and small effects on function at short-term followup,but effects were smaller and no longer statistically significant at 3 and 6 months (SOE:moderate for pain and function). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.81For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found spinal manipulation associated with better short-term pain relief versus other active interventions at 1 month (10comparisons from 6 trials, WMD 2.76 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 5.19 to 0.32,I2=27%) and 6 months (7 comparisons from 4 trials, WMD 3.07, 95% CI 5.42 to 0.71,I2=0%), though the magnitude of effects was below the small/slight threshold. Therewas no difference at 12 months (3 trials, WMD 0.76, 95% CI 3.19 to 1.66, I2=0%).Manipulation was also associated with greater function improvement in function versusother active interventions at 1 month (10 comparisons from 6 trials, SMD 0.17, 95% CI0.29 to 0.06, I2=3%); effects were smaller and no longer statistically significant at 6 and12 months. Three trials not included in the systematic reviews reported results consistentwith these findings (SOE: moderate for pain and function). For acute low back pain, four trials in a systematic review found spinal manipulation pluseither exercise or advice associated with greater improvement in function at 1 week (SMD0.41, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.10, I2=18%) versus exercise or advice alone, but there were nodifferences at 1 month (3 trials, SMD 0.09, 0.61 to 0.16, I2=41%) (SOE: low). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found spinal manipulation plus anotheractive treatment associated with greater pain relief at 1 month (3 trials, WMD 5.88 on a0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 10.85 to I2=0%), 3 months (2 trials, MD 7.23, 95% CI11.72 to 2.74, I2=43%), and 12 months (2 trials, MD 3.31, 95% CI 6.60 to 0.02,I2=12%) versus the other treatment alone, combination therapy was also associated withbetter function at 1 month, (2 trials, SMD 0.40, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.22, 0.38 0.06, SMD0.21, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.09, I2=0%). One trial not included in the systematic reviewreported results consistent with these findings (SOE: low). For radicular low back pain, one good-quality trial found spinal manipulation plus homeexercise and advice associated with greater improvement in leg and back pain at 12 weeksversus home exercise and advice alone (mean differences about 1 point on a 0 to 10 scale),but effects were smaller (0.3 to 0.7 points) and no longer statistically significant at 52weeks (SOE: low). Harms were not reported well in most trials of spinal manipulation. No serious adverseevents were reported and most adverse events were related to muscle soreness or transientincreases in pain (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included 12 systematic reviews361, 425-436 with a total of 69 individual trials of spinal manipulation versus sham, an inactive treatment, or another active treatment for acute and chronic low back pain. 16 The APS/ACP review concluded that there was fair evidence that spinal manipulation was associated with moderate benefits for acute and chronic low back pain. One of the reviews of spinal manipulation in the APS/ACP review was subsequently updated as separate good-quality reviews for acute low back pain 437 and chronic low back pain (Table 10; Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.82Appendix Tables E27, F27)438 The acute low back pain review included 19 randomized trials; eight of these trials were not included in the APS/ACP review.439-446 Sample sizes ranged from 36 to 323 participants (total sample=2674). About half of the trials restricted inclusion to patients with acute low back pain,442-445, 447-451 four included patients with a mix of acute and subacute back pain439, 441, 446, 452 and six included patients with acute to chronic low back pain.440, 453-457 A separate review438 included 26 trials (sample sizes 29 to 1,334, total sample=6070 participants) of spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain; 18 of these trials were not included in the prior Cochrane review. 185, 192, 196, 402, 458-471 Only eight trials restricted inclusion to patients with symptoms longer than 3 months.192, 196, 402, 458, 460, 464, 465, 467, 470 The remainder permitted inclusion of patients with nonchronic symptoms, but the mean duration of back pain was generally months to years in duration. Six studies of acute low back pain were rated as low risk of bias 441-443, 445, 446, 453 and nine studies of chronic low back pain were rated as low risk of bias.185, 192, 461, 462, 469, 472-474 Methodological shortcomings in the high risk of bias studies included unblinded design, unclear allocation concealment methods, incomplete followup, selective reporting of outcomes and in one study 475 significant baseline differences among groups. In the trials included in the systematic reviews, spinal manipulation was compared against a wide variety of interventions, including various sham or inert therapies (placebo antiedema gel, detuned short-wave diathermy, bed rest, detuned ultrasound, corset and transcutaneous muscle stimulation, sham SMT), or another active intervention (acupuncture, back school, educational back booklet with or without additional counseling, exercise therapy, myofascial therapy, massage, pain clinic, pharmacological/analgesic therapy, short-wave diathermy, standard medical care [including analgesic therapy and advice/reassurance], standard physiotherapy, and ultrasound). The primary type of thrust technique used in the spinal manipulation interventions also varied. High-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) thrust was used in most studies, though a combination of manipulation and mobilization or other mobilization techniques such as flexion-distraction or the Maitland method were used in 8 trials and unspecified types of SMT were used in 14 trials. The number and frequency of manipulation treatments also varied among trials that reported this information. Approximately half of the acute low back pain trials did not report number of treatments, but those that did reported 1 and 10 treatment sessions. For chronic low back pain trials, the average maximum number of treatments allowed was 8 and the average duration of treatment 7 weeks in trials that provided this information. In both acute and chronic low back pain trials, followup ranged from 2 weeks to 2 years, with approximately half of the studies only reporting short-term outcomes (<3 months). One study of SMT for acute low back pain only measured the immediate effect of treatment, 2 days after the end of treatment. 446 We identified 16 additional trials published subsequent to the updated reviews, 8 of which were trials for chronic low back pain,241, 476-482 two for acute or subacute low back pain483-485, one for mixed duration low back pain466 one for radicular low back pain.486 (Table 18; Appendix Tables E28, F28). We also included 3 trials that were excluded from the systematic reviews because they enrolled patients with sciatica/radiculopathy. 487-489 Two studies were poor quality487, 488 and one was good quality.489 These additional trials varied in terms of the comparators Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.83including epidural steroid injections,487 sham treatments including detuned ultrasound,476 simulated manipulation,489 side lying,477 and light massage.480 The duration of treatment ranged from a single treatment479 on 1 day to 18 sessions over a period of 9 months. Spinal Manipulation V ersus Sham Therapy Acute Low Back Pain The systematic review of spinal manipulation for acute low back pain437 included one high risk of bias trial (n=192) of SMT versus sham SMT.444 It found no differences between seven sessions of high velocity low amplitude thrust SMT over 2 weeks versus sham adjustments at 1-month followup (MD 0.50, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.06, function). One additional poor-quality study not included in the systematic review 485 (n=100) compared three treatments: SMT (up to 2 treatments over a 3-day period) with placebo diclofenac, sham SMT with diclofenac, and sham SMT with placebo diclofenac. Results at 7 to 9 days post treatment favored SMT with placebo diclofenac versus the sham SMT with diclofenac (mean improvement from baseline on RDQ 7.71 vs. 4.75, p=0.01) and versus sham SMT with placebo diclofenac (data not provided), but effects were small. Chronic Low Back Pain The systematic review of manipulation for chronic low back pain included three high risk of bias trials of SMT versus sham SMT. 459, 464, 490 The SMT interventions in these trials ranged from four to seven treatment sessions over 2 weeks to 5 months. There was no difference between SMT versus sham SMT in pain at 1 month (3 trials, WMD 3.24, 95% CI 13.62 to 7.15 on a 0 to 100 scale, I2=53%). Two of the trials (n=64 and 19) 459, 490 reported a nonsignificant effects in favor of SMT, while the third trial (n=65)464 reported a nonsignificant effect that favored sham SMT. One trial that reported 3- and 6-month outcomes464 reported nonsignificant effects that favored sham SMT. This was also the only trial to report function; it found a small benefit favoring SMT at 1 month (SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.06) but there were no differences at 3 or 6 months. Two additional trials compared SMT versus a sham SMT procedure for chronic low back pain. 479, 482 A good-quality trial (n=148) found no difference between a single treatment of region-specific SMT versus sham SMT (nonregion-specific HVLA) immediately following the procedure. 479 One additional fair-quality trial (n=94) compared two different SMT protocols (12 sessions of SMT over 1 month and 12 sessions of SMT over 1 month plus maintenance SMT for 9 months) versus sham manipulation for chronic low back pain. 482 Both SMT groups were superior to sham at 1 month (mean difference 5.0 on a 0-100 scale, p<0.05), with no difference between active SMT interventions. At 10 months, maintenance SMT was associated with small improvements in both pain (16.3 difference on a 0-100 scale, p<0.05) and function (18.1 difference on ODI, p<0.05) compared with either 1 month of SMT or sham manipulation.

Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.84Spinal Manipulation V ersus an Inactive Treatment Acute Low Back Pain Seven trials included in the systematic review of manipulation for acute low back pain437 compared SMT versus inert interventions (an educational 452). Two trials were rated low risk of bias.443, 453 There were no differences between SMT versus inactive treatments for pain relief at 1 week (3 trials, MD on 0-10 scale 0.14, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.96, I2=27%),447, 452, 453 one trial found SMT associated with better longer-term pain relief (MD 1.20 at 3 months, 95% CI 2.11 to 0.29).453 There were no differences between SMT versus inert interventions in function at 1 week (2 trials, SMD 0.08, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.21, I2=0%) 447, 453 or at 3 months (1 trial, SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.02).453 Chronic Low Back Pain The systematic revie w of manipulation for chronic low back pain438 included four trials of SMT versus 474, 475, 492 One trial (n=76) was rated low risk of bias.474 It found SMT associated with greater improvement in the \"main complaint\" (mean difference 0.9 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.7) versus detuned therapy at 12 months. Effect also favored SMT for function at 12 months, though the difference was not statistically significant (mean difference 0.6, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.3). Effects at earlier time points were smaller not statistically significant. Three high risk of bias trials found no clear differences between SMT versus various inert interventions in pain or other outcomes. 456, 475, 492 Three additional trials (n=42, 40, 111 and 400)476, 477, 480 not included in the systematic review also compared SMT versus other inactive treatments for chronic low back pain. One of the trials was rated good quality 480 and two were rated fair quality.476, 477 The inactive comparators were detuned ultrasound,476 side lying without SMT,477 and light massage for 5 minutes.480 One trial evaluated effects of a single treatment session immediately after treatment.477 The good-quality trial480 compared 6, 12, or 18 sessions of SMT versus light massage. All patients underwent 18 sessions of therapy; at each session they also received hot packs and low-intensity ultrasound and for sessions in which they did not undergo SMT, they received 5 minutes of light massage instead. At the primary outcome of 12 weeks, both those receiving either 12 or 18 sessions of SMT demonstrated statistically significant, but modest improvements in pain over those receiving light massage only; 12 sessions was associated with slightly greater improvement versus light massage only (MD 8.6 on a 0 to100 scale, 95% CI 3.2, 14.0) than 18 sessions (MD 6.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 11.2). Although 12 sessions of SMT were superior to light massage only for function at 6 weeks (mean difference 7.5 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 1.7 to 13.3), effects were small. Differences were smaller and not statistically significant at 12 and 24 weeks. Eight sessions of SMT were superior to light massage only at 52 weeks for pain (mean difference 7.6, 95% CI 0.8 to 9.2) and function (mean difference 8.8, 95% CI 3.3 to 14.4). Effects on the SF- Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.8536 physical and mental component scales and EuroQoL were small and did not show any clear differences between the SMT treatments versus light massage only. One fair-quality trial found SMT associated with greater pain relief versus side lying with SMT (11 versus 2.2 on a 0 to 100 scale, p=0.04).477 The third trial found 8 sessions of SMT over 4 to 8 weeks associated with greater pain relief at 6 months versus detuned ultrasound, though the difference was not statistically significant based on a prespecified p-value of <0.025 due to multiple comparisons (mean difference 1.24 on 0-10 scale, 95% CI 2.37 to 0.30, p=0.032).476 SMT was associated with greater improvement in the ODI (mean difference 7.14, 95% CI 12.8 to 1.52, p=0.013). Spinal Manipulation V ersus Another Active Treatment Acute or Subacute Low Back Pain Eight trials in the systematic review compared SMT versus another active intervention (exercise;439, 451 physical therapy [according to McKenzie principles];448, 452, 453, 456, 457 massage;454 standard general practitioner [GP] care consisting primarily of prescription [diclofenac or codeine] or or back school452, 456). One trial was rated as a low risk of bias.453 There were no differences between SMT versus other active interventions in pain relief (0-10 scale) at 1 week (3 trials, MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.65; I2=0%), 1 month (3 trials, MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.18; I2=0%), 3 to 6 months (2 trials MD 0.20, 95% CI 1.13 to 0.73, I2=81%), or 1 year (1 trial, MD 0.40, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.88). Findings were similar for function, with no differences observed at any time point. Among the trials included in the pooled analyses, the active comparators were exercise or physical therapy in all trials except for one, which evaluated back school. 452 The only low risk of bias trial453 compared SMT (n=122) versus physical therapy/McKenzie (n=133) versus a minimal intervention (an educational booklet). This trial found no differences between SMT versus physical therapy/McKenzie in pain at 1 week (mean difference 0.20 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.96) or 1 month (mean difference 0.40, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.16), or in function (SMD 0.07 at 1 week, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.33 and SMD 0.09 at 1 month, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.16). One subsequent good-quality trial (n=112) found manual thrust SMT for acute or subacute low back pain associated with greater effects on pain and the ODI versus mechanical assisted manipulation or usual care at the end of four weeks of treatments (mean differences in pain scores -1.4 to -1.7 point and on the ODI -6.5 to -8.1 points), but differences were smaller and no longer statistically significant at 3 or 6 months. 484 Chronic Low Back Pain Fifteen studies in the systematic review of SMT for chronic low back pain compared SMT with another active intervention.185, 192, 460-463, 465, 466, 468-473, 475 Eight trials were rated low risk of bias. The comparators were acupuncture (1 trial), back school, (2 trials), educational back booklet with or without additional counseling (2 trials), exercise therapy (9 trials), myofascial therapy (1 trial), massage (1 trial), pain clinic (1 trial), pharmaceutical/analgesic therapy only (2 trials), short-wave diathermy (1 trial), and standard medical care, including analgesic therapy and advice/reassurance (4 trials), standard physiotherapy (5 trials), and ultrasound (1 trial). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.86Based on trials rated low risk of bias, SMT was associated with better short-term pain relief versus other interventions at 1 month (10 comparisons from 6 trials, WMD 2.76 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 5.19 to 0.32, I2=27%) and 6 months (7 comparisons from 4 trials, WMD 3.07, 95% CI 5.42 to 0.71, I2=0%), though effects were small. Effects on pain relief were even smaller and no longer statistically significant at 12 months in three trials (3 trials, WMD 0.76, 95% CI 3.19 to 1.66, I2=0%). 185, 192, 463 For functional status, SMT was associated with greater functional improvement versus other active interventions at 1 month, though effects were small (10 comparisons from 6 trials, SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.06, I2=3%); as for pain, effects on function were even smaller and no longer statistically significant at 6 and 12 months (8 comparisons from 6 trials, SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.00, I2=0% and 9 comparisons from 5 trials, SMD 0.06, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.05, I2=0%, respectively). Exercise and physical therapy were the most commonly evaluated active comparators in the trials included in the meta-analyses; results from this subgroup of trials appeared consistent with the overall estimates. Three additional trials compared SMT versus other active treatments for chronic low back pain. 241, 478, 481 One good-quality trial (n=301) found no clear differences between 12 weeks of SMT versus supervised or home exercise in pain or function.241 Effects were small (differences 0.1 to 0.6 points on a 0 to 10 pain scale and 0.2 to 1.3 points on the RDQ) and not statistically significant. A good-quality trial (n=350) found SMT (maximum of 15 sessions over 12 weeks) associated with worse function at 12 months versus exercise (mean difference 1.5 on the RDQ, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.9), though the effect was small. 481 Results for pain also favored exercise, but the difference was not statistically significant (mean difference 2.8 on 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.8). A fair-quality trial (n=210) found SMT (20-minute sessions once a week for 4 to 6 weeks) associated with greater pain relief and improvement in function versus back school or physical therapy (fifteen 1-hour sessions over 3 weeks); differences were less than 1 point on 0-10 pain scale and less than 5 points on the RDQ. 478 Low Back Pain Of Mixed Duration One fair-quality trial (n=134)466 of patients with acute to chronic low back pain that was not included in the systematic reviews found no differences between SMT (3 to 7 session) versus McKenzie exercise (3 to 7 sessions) in pain or function, though SMT was associated with better effects versus advice (one 45- to 60-minute session) on the RDQ (MD -3, 95% CI -6 to 0). Spinal Manipulation Plus Other Active Treatment V ersus the Active Treatment Without Manipulation Acute Low Back Pain Four trials in the systematic review of SMT for acute low back pain compared SMT plus another intervention (one trial each of advice on posture, exercise, and avoidance of occupational distress, 455 analgesic medication (parecetamol, diclofenac, or dihydrocodeine),445 exercise,440 or physiotherapy442). One trial was rated low risk of bias.445 It found no differences between SMT plus analgesics versus analgesics alone at 1 week or at 3 to 6 months in pain relief (MD 0.84 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.72 and MD 0.65, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.62, respectively). Two high risk of bias trials 440, 455 found SMT plus either exercise or advice associated with greater improvement in function at 1 week (SMD 0.41, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.10, I2=18%) versus Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.87exercise or advice alone, but there were no differences in function at 1 month (3 trials, SMD 0.09, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.21, trials, SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.16, I2=41%). Chronic Low Back Pain The systematic review of spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain. 438 included five studies185, 462, 464, 467, 493 of SMT plus another active treatment versus the other active treatment alone. Two trials were rated low risk of bias.185, 462 The comparators were extension exercises,467 best care + exercise,185 myofascial therapy,462 or usual care.464 Combination therapy with SMT was more effective versus active treatment without SMT for pain relief at 1 month (3 trials, MD 5.88 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 10.85 to 0.90, I2=0%),462, 464, 467 3 months (2 trials, MD 7.23, 95% CI 11.72 to 2.74, I2=43%),185, 464 and 12 months (2 trials, MD 3.31, 95% CI 6.60 to 0.02, I2=12%).185, 467 Combination therapy with SMT was also more effective versus active treatment without SMT on function at 1 month, (2 trials, SMD 0.40, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.07, I2=0%), trials, SMD 0.22, 0.38 to 0.06, I2=33%), and 12 95% CI 0.34 to 0.09, I2=0%). Results from the two trials rated low risk of bias were consistent with the pooled estimates. One fair-quality trial (n=91) not included in the systematic review found SMT (2 sessions once a week for 4 weeks) plus standard medical therapy associated with lower pain intensity (mean difference 1.2 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.3) and better function (mean difference 4.0 on the RDQ, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.7) at the end of therapy versus standard medical care alone for chronic low back pain. 483 Radicular Low Back Pain One fair-quality trial (n=192) of patients with subacute to chronic back-related leg pain (n=192) found SMT plus home exercise and advice associated with greater improvement in leg and back pain at 12 weeks versus home exercise and advice alone (mean differences about 1 point on a 0 to 10 scale), but effects were smaller (0.3 to 0.7 points) and no longer statistically significant at 52 weeks. 486 Harms As in the prior APS/ACP review, we found that harms were poorly reported in trials of SMT. For chronic low back pain, ~two-thirds of trials did not report adverse events.438 When reported, adverse events in patients undergoing SMT were limited to muscle soreness, stiffness, and/or transient increase in pain. None of the studies reported any serious complications in either the experimental or control group. Physical Modalities: Ultrasound Key Points For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found no difference between ultrasoundversus sham ultrasound in pain at the end of treatment (3 trials, mean difference 7.12 on0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 18.0 to 3.75, I2=77%) and two trials found no effects on pain 4 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.88weeks after the end of treatment. Evidence from 5 trials was too inconsistent to determine effects on function, though a larger, good-quality trial found no effect on the RDQ (SOE: low for pain, insufficient for function). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found no differences between ultrasoundversus no ultrasound in pain (2 trials, mean difference 2.16, 95% CI 4.66 to 0.34,I2=0%) or back-specific function (2 trials, mean difference 95% CI 3.14 to 2.32),but estimates were imprecise (SOE: low for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, evidence from 3 trials was insufficient to determine effects ofultrasound plus exercise versus exercise alone on pain or function, due to imprecision andmethodological shortcomings (SOE: insufficient). For radicular low back pain due to spinal stenosis, a small trial found no differencesbetween ultrasound plus exercise versus sham ultrasound plus exercise in back pain, legpain, or the ODI after 3 weeks of therapy (SOE: insufficient) There was insufficient evidence from three small trials with methodological shortcomingsto determine effects of ultrasound versus other interventions (SOE: insufficient). For radiculopathy, there was insufficient evidence from two small trials withmethodological shortcomings to determine effects of ultrasound versus other interventions(SOE: insufficient). No study evaluated the effectiveness of ultrasound for acute nonradicular low back pain. One trial found no differences between ultrasound versus sham ultrasound in risk of anyadverse event (6.0% vs. 5.9%, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.49 serious adverse events(1.3% vs. 2.7%, RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.88) (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included three small (n=15 to 73) trials of therapeutic ultrasound for low back pain.494-496 All trials had methodological shortcomings. One trial (n=73) found ultrasound associated with a higher likelihood of being pain-free versus sham ultrasound or analgesics (41% vs. 12% vs. 6.8%, p<0.001 for ultrasound versus placebo), but used a quasi-randomized design (alternate allocation). 495 In addition, all patients were placed on bed rest, a treatment no longer recommended. One small (n=10) trial of patients with chronic low back pain found ultrasound moderately superior to sham ultrasound after 10 treatment sessions, but had high loss to followup and did not perform intention-to-treat analysis. 494 The third trial (n=36), which was published in 1960, found no difference between ultrasound and sham ultrasound for low back pain of unspecified duration in pain improvement after 1 month of therapy.496 The APS/ACP review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine effects of ultrasound. We identified one good-quality systematic review published since the APS/ACP review (Table 10; Appendix Tables E29, F29). 497 It included seven trials, including one of the trials described above494 and six subsequent trials.465, 494, 498-502 All trials enrolled patients with chronic nonradicular low back pain. Sample sizes ranged from 15 to 120 subjects. One trial was Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.89published in Croatian.502 All studies evaluated 1 MHz continuous ultrasound at intensities from 1 to 2.5 W/cm2, applied for 5 to 10 minutes or based on Gray' s formula. The number of sessions ranged from 6 to 18. The review focused on outcomes immediately following the prescribed ultrasound treatment course; two trials also evaluated patients 4 weeks501 and 6 months465 after the end of treatment. Four trials evaluated ultrasound versus sham ultrasound,494, 498, 501, 502 two trials ultrasound versus no ultrasound,499, 500 and three trials ultrasound versus other treatments (spinal manipulation,465 electrical stimulation,499 and phonophoresis500). In all of the trials except for one,494 patients in all treatment groups also underwent exercise therapy. Although all trials had methodological shortcomings, two trials498, 501 were classified by the systematic review as being at low risk of bias, based on meeting six or more of 12 risk of bias criteria. Patients were blinded to receipt of ultrasound in four trials, 494, 498, 501, 502 care providers were blinded in none of the trials, and intention-to-treat analysis was reported in two trials.498, 501 The largest randomized trial (n=455) of ultrasound was published after the systematic review (Table 19; Appendix Tables E30, F30).503 It compared ultrasound versus sham ultrasound for chronic nonradicular low back pain and evaluated patients 4 weeks after the end of treatment. About 20 percent of patients also underwent exercise therapy. The trial used a 2 x 2 factorial design in which patients were also randomized osteopathic manual treatment versus no manual treatment; there was no interaction between the ultrasound and manual treatment interventions. We also identified three small trials of ultrasound that were not included in the systematic review. One fair-quality trial (n=30) compared ultrasound versus low-level laser therapy for back pain 3 weeks, 504 one fair-quality trial (n=45) compared ultrasound plus exercise, sham ultrasound plus exercise, and no treatment for spinal stenosis,505 and one poor-quality trial (n=60) of ultrasound versus traction or low-level laser therapy for acute radiculopathy due to herniated disc.506 Ultrasound V ersus Sham Ultrasound Chronic Low Back Pain The systematic review found no difference between ultrasound versus sham ultrasound in pain at the end of treatment (3 trials, mean difference 7.12 on 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 18.0 to 3.75, I2=77%). 497 Statistical heterogeneity was high, with one trial498 reporting an effect favoring ultrasound (mean difference 20.0, 95% CI 31.1 to 8.81) and two trials501, 502 reporting no effect (mean difference 4.10 and 0.90). Ultrasound was associated with better functional status at the end of treatment than sham ultrasound (3 trials, standardized mean difference 0.45, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.05, I2=0%). 497 Although statistical heterogeneity was not present, only one501 of the trials reported a statistically significant effect (standardized mean difference 0.71, 95% CI 1.30 to 0.13 [~8 points on a 0 to 100 scale], versus 0.26 and 0.20, or [~5 points on a 0 to 100 scale] in the other two trials). 494, 498 One additional good-quality trial not included in the systematic review found no differences between ultrasound versus sham ultrasound on the RDQ (median 3 vs. 4, p=0.76) or the SF-36 General Health score (72 vs. 72, p=0.53) at the end of treatment. 503 Two trials of ultrasound versus sham ultrasound reported no effects on pain 4 weeks after the end of treatment.501, 503 In a fair-quality trial,501 there was no difference in pain scores (28 vs. 26, p=0.48) and in a good-quality trial503 there was no difference in the likelihood of experiencing 30 percent (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.20) or 50% (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.35) Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.90improvement in pain. Results were inconsistent for function. The fair-quality trial501 found that ultrasound was superior to sham ultrasound on the Functional Rating Index (23 vs. 30, p=0.04), but the good-quality trial503 found no effect on the RDQ (median 3 vs. 3, p=0.93). Ultrasound Plus Exercise V ersus Exercise Alone Chronic Low Back Pain The systematic review497 found no differences between ultrasound plus exercise versus exercise alone in pain (mean difference 2.16 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 4.66 to 0.34, I2=0%) or back-specific function (mean 0.41 on the ODI, 95% CI 3.14 to 2.32); pooled estimates favored ultrasound but were imprecise and were based on only two trials with methodological shortcomings. 499, 500 Neither individual trial found a statistically significant effect on either outcome. Mixed Duration Low Back Pain A small (n=30), fair-quality trial found no differences between ultrasound plus exercise versus sham ultrasound plus exercise in back pain, leg pain, or the ODI after 3 weeks of therapy in patients with low back pain for 3 weeks.504 Radicular Low Back Pain A small (n=45), fair-quality trial found no differences between ultrasound plus exercises versus sham ultrasound plus exercise in back pain, leg pain, the ODI, or paracetamol use after 3 weeks of therapy in patients with spinal stenosis. 505 Ultrasound V ersus Other Interventions Chronic Low Back Pain Three nonblinded trials compared ultrasound versus other interventions.465, 499, 500 In one trial, ultrasound, versus spinal manipulation, was associated with worse pain at the end of treatment (mean difference 16.4 on 0 to 100 scale, 26.8 to 6.1), though the difference was not as pronounced 6 months after the end of treatment (1.4, 95% CI 2.7 to 0.1).465 Spinal manipulation was also associated with better ODI scores at the end of treatment (mean difference 7.8, 95% CI 13.2 to 2.4), with similar findings 6 months after the end of treatment. One trial each found no differences between ultrasound versus electrical stimulation 499 or ultrasound versus phonophoresis500 in pain or function. Mixed Duration Low Back Pain A small (n=30), fair-quality trial of patients with low back pain 3 weeks found ultrasound associated with higher pain intensity (median 4 vs. 3 on a 0 to 10 V AS, p<0.001) and worse function (median 16 vs. 12 on the ODI, p<0.001) versus high-intensity laser therapy after three weeks of treatment. 504 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.91Radicular Low Back Pain A small (n=60), poor-quality trial found no differences between ultrasound versus traction or low-level laser therapy for acute radiculopathy in back or leg pain or function as measured by the RDQ or modified ODI.506 Harms Harms were only reported in one good-quality trial of therapeutic ultrasound. This trial found no difference between ultrasound versus sham ultrasound in risk of any adverse event (6.0% vs. 5.9%, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.13) serious adverse events (1.3% vs. 2.7%, RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.88). 503 Physical Modalities: Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Key Points For acute or subacute low back pain, evidence from single trials with methodologicalshortcomings was too limited to permit reliable conclusions regarding effectiveness (SOE:insufficient). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found no differences betweentranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) versus sham TENS in pain intensity (4trials, WMD 4.47 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 12.84 to 3.89) or function (2 trials, WMD1.36 on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 4.38 to 1.66) at short-term followup; most trials foundno effect on pain or function at the end of a course of treatment (SOE: low for pain andfunction). For chronic low back pain, a systematic review found no differences between TENS versusacupuncture for short- (4 trials; SMD 0.15, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.63) or (2trials; SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96). Evidence for TENS versus other interventionswas too limited to permit reliable conclusions (SOE: low for TENS vs. acupuncture). Evidence on harms associated with TENS was limited, but suggests an increased risk ofskin site reactions without an increased risk of serious adverse events (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included a good-quality systematic review507 of TENS versus sham that included one good-quality trial,508 and one poor-quality trial.509 The first (good quality) trial (n=145) compared 4 weeks of treatment with followup 2 months after treatment cessation.508 The second trial (n=30) compared 2 weeks of TENS versus sham, with no post-treatment followup, and was rated poor quality due to lack of blinding, unclear allocation concealment, and incomplete outcome data. 509 The APS/ACP review also included evidence from systematic reviews of acupuncture,363 massage,510 spinal manipulation,426 traction, and superficial heat and cold511 that each included one to five trials of TENS versus these interventions. The APS/ ACP review concluded that there was insufficient to determine the effects of TENS for acute or chronic low back pain. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.92We identified a more recent good-quality systematic review of TENS versus sham TENS512 that included the good-quality trial described above508 and four other trials (Table 10; Tables E31, F31).508, 513-516 The poor-quality study discussed above509 was not included, presumably because there was no post-treatment followup. The studies enrolled between 50 and 324 patients with chronic low back pain. Duration of treatment ranged from 2 to 8 weeks in five trials 508, 513, 514, 516 and duration of followup ranged from 2 to 11 weeks in three trials;508, 513, 516 duration of followup was not reported in one crossover study.515 One trial also included an exercise comparison group and one trial513 included a PENS comparison group. Three trials were classified as higher-quality508, 514, 516 based on meeting at least six of eleven Cochrane Back Review Group criteria; common methodological shortcomings were failure to repeat adequate allocation concealment techniques, unblinded design or unclear blinding status, and failure to report intention-to-treat analysis. We identified three other trials of TENS for chronic low back pain that compared TENS versus sham TENS 517, 518 or interventional therapy519 (Table 20; fair-quality trials (n=236517 and n=21518), one of which included patients with or without radicular symptoms517 evaluated TENS (3 months or 5 weeks of treatment) versus sham TENS. The third, good-quality trial (n=150), evaluated 2 weeks of TENS treatment versus interferential therapy.519 All three trials only evaluated outcomes at the end of treatment. TENS V ersus Sham TENS Chronic Low Back Pain For chronic low back pain, a good-quality trial (n=145) included in the APS/ACP review found no differences between TENS versus sham TENS in pain, functional status, or other outcomes after 4 weeks of treatment or 11 weeks total followup. 508 A smaller (n=30) trial included in the APS/ACP review found TENS associated with decreased pain versus sham TENS (WMD 33.6, 95% CI 52.3 to 14.0), but only evaluated outcomes immediately after a 60-minute treatment session. 509 A systematic review which included the good-quality trial described above and three other trials published subsequent to the APS/ACP review found no statistically significant differences between TENS versus sham TENS in pain scores at followup ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months (4 trials, WMD 4.47, 95% CI 12.84 to 3.89). 512 There was also no difference between TENS versus sham in disability (2 trials, WMD 1.36, 95% CI 4.38 to 1.66.) Two trials (n=21 and n=236) that were not included in the systematic review reported results that were generally consistent.517, 518 Both trials found no differences between TENS versus sham TENS on any outcome after 6 weeks of treatment, including mean pain scores,518 patient satisfaction, and functional improvement.517 However, after 3 months of treatment, one of the trials, which enrolled patients with radicular or nonradicular low back pain, found TENS associated with greater likelihood of experiencing improvement 50 percent from baseline in V AS score versus sham for both lumbar (RR 3.71, 95% CI 1.69 to 8.18) and radicular pain (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.51). 517 However, mean changes in pain scores were not reported, there were no statistically significant differences between TENS versus sham TENS on other 3-month outcomes, including function, quality of life, and patient satisfaction, and the trial did not Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.93report outcomes following the end of treatment. Estimates of effect were somewhat stronger in subgroups of patients with radicular symptoms or a neuropathic pain component, but estimates were imprecise, with overlapping CIs. TENS V ersus Other Interventions Acute Low Back Pain Evidence on effectiveness of TENS for acute or subacute low back pain was limited. For acute low back pain, one small fair-quality trial (n=20) found acupuncture superior to TENS for pain (mean difference 21 on a 0 to 100 V AS score, 95% CI 4.13 to 38).520 Chronic Low Back Pain For chronic low back pain, the APS/ACP review found no difference between TENS versus acupuncture in short- (4 trials; SMD 0.15, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.63) or long-term (2 trials; SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96) 363 or between TENS versus gentle ice massage (1 trial),521 though the quality of evidence was fair to poor for both comparisons.29 Evidence for TENS versus other interventions was limited and mixed. Based on one trial traction was superior to TENS, 522 and minimal ice massage was inferior in one trial523 with no difference in another trial. 521 A systematic review512 published subsequent to the APS/ACP review included one trial of TENS versus exercise508 and one trial of TENS versus PENS513 for chronic low back pain. Each review reported no statistically significant differences in pain or disability. One trial not included in prior reviews of TENS versus interferential therapy found no differences in pain or disability, though for one measure (the McGill Pain Questionnaire pain rating index) interferential therapy was superior to TENS (mean change from baseline 17.66 vs. 25.34, p>0.05). 519 Harms The APS/ACP review found limited evidence on harms from trials of TENS, though there was no clear difference between active versus sham TENS in likelihood of minor skin irritation at the application site. In one trial published since the APS/ACP review, active TENS was associated with greater likelihood of application skin site reactions versus sham TENS (9% vs. 3%; RR 3.73, 95% CI 1.07 to 13). 517 There were no significant differences in risk of other harms, including withdrawals due to adverse events (3% vs. 0.8%; RR 3.05, 95% CI 0.32 to 29) and serious adverse events (4% vs. 5%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.24 to 22), though event rates were low and estimates imprecise. Physical Modalities: Electrical Muscle Stimulation Key Points There was insufficient evidence from five RCTs to determine effects of electrical musclestimulation plus exercise versus exercise alone or versus other interventions, due tomethodological limitations and imprecision (SOE: insufficient). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.94 There was insufficient evidence to determine harms of electrical muscle stimulation (SOE: insufficient). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review did not evaluate effects of electrical muscle stimulation for low back pain. We identified five trials on the effects of electrical muscle stimulation for low back pain (Table 21; Appendix Tables E33, F33). 492, 499, 524-526 The sample size ranged from 28 to 80 in four trials and was 164 in the fifth trial.492 Four trials enrolled patients with chronic low back pain and the fifth trial492 enrolled patients with back pain of 3 weeks to 6 months in duration. Two trials compared electrical muscle stimulation plus exercise versus exercise,499, 524 one trial electrical muscle stimulation plus exercise versus sham stimulation plus exercise,525 and three trials electrical muscle stimulation versus other interventions (ultrasound,499 TENS or sham TENS,526 and massage, manipulation, or lumbar supports492), with or without exercise. The duration of stimulation sessions ranged from 15 minutes to at least 8 hours, the number of sessions ranged from 2 to 60, and the duration of treatment ranged from 2 days to 2 months. The technical parameters of the stimulation varied. Outcomes were assessed at the end of 2 days to 8 weeks of therapy in four trials and at 6 months (4 months after the end of therapy) in the fifth trial. 525 One trial was rated fair quality492 and the other four poor quality. Methodological shortcomings included unclear randomization and allocation concealment methods, unblinded design, and lack of intention-to-treat analysis. In two trials, some subscales of the SF-36 were analyzed as mean differences and others as median differences without a rationale. 499, 524 Electrical Muscle Stimulation Plus Exercise V ersus Sham Stimulation Plus Exercise Chronic Low Back Pain One poor-quality (n=55) trial found no differences between 2 months of therapy with electrical muscle stimulation plus exercise versus sham stimulation plus exercise in subscales of the Low Back Pain Outcome Instrument or the SF-36 mental health subscale after 2 or 6 months. 525 Although the trial reported some differences as statistically significant, this does not appear to be possible based on the mean scores and standard deviations (e.g., for the Low Back Pain Outcome Instrument Expectations Met subscale, scores of 2.71[standard deviation 0.77] vs. 2.56 [0.71] were reported as having a p<0.05). The trial reported very high (>50%) attrition at 6 months. Electrical Muscle Stimulation Plus Exercise V ersus Exercise Alone Chronic Low Back Pain Two poor-quality trials (n=41 and n=68) each found electrical muscle stimulation plus exercise superior to exercise for pain at the end of a 6- or 8-week course of therapy.499, 524 Differences in pain scores averaged 2.9 and 1.5 points on a 0-10 V AS scale. Effects on the ODI were mixed (differences 12.6 and 1.6 points). Electrical muscle stimulation was superior to exercise on some SF-36 subscales. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.95Electrical Muscle Stimulation V ersus Other Interventions Acute/Subacute Low Back Pain One fair-quality trial (n=164) found no difference between electrical muscle stimulation (at least 8 hours/day) versus manipulation, massage, or lumbar support in improvement in pain (range 9.6 to 24 on a 0-100 V AS) after a 3-week course of therapy.492 Chronic Low Back Pain One poor-quality crossover trial (n=24) found no difference between electrical muscle stimulation versus TENS or sham TENS in pain scores after a 2-day course of therapy (39.7 vs. 40.6 vs. 44.8 on a 0-100 V AS scale). 526 However, the combination of electrical muscle stimulation plus TENS was more effective than sham TENS (36.3 vs. 44.8, p=0.02). Another poor-quality trial (n=59) found no differences between electrical muscle stimulation plus exercise versus ultrasound plus exercise in the pain scores (0.4 vs. 0.9 on 0-10 V AS) or the ODI (6.80 vs. 8.60) after a 6-week course of therapy. 499 Harms One trial of electrical muscle stimulation reported no adverse treatment effects.526 The other trials did not report harms. Physical Modalities: Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Key Points There was insufficient evidence from seven trials to determine effects of percutaneouselectrical nerve stimulation (PENS) versus sham, PENS plus exercise versus exercisealone, or PENS versus other interventions, due to methodological limitations, inconsistencyand imprecision (SOE: insufficient). Harms were poorly reported in trials of PENS (SOE: insufficient). Detailed Synthesis Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) involves the application of an electrical nerve stimulus via needles placed at the dermatomal levels corresponding to the pain (rather than at acupuncture sites). The APS/ACP review 29 included four trials (n=34 to 64) of percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) for low back pain.513, 527, 528 Two trials compared PENS versus sham PENS,513, 527 one trial compared PENS plus physical therapy versus sham PENS plus physical therapy,528 three trials compared PENS versus TENS,513, 527, 529 and one trial compared PENS versus exercise.513 Two trials enrolled patients with nonradicular low back pain,513, 528 one trial enrolled patients with radicular back pain,527 and one trial did not specify presence or absence of radicular symptoms.529 All trials enrolled patients with chronic low back pain; although the trial of radicular back pain enrolled patients with symptoms for >6 weeks, the mean duration was 21 months. 513 PENS was administered two or three times weekly for 2 to 8 weeks, with each session 15 to 45 minutes in duration. Outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.96in two trials,513, 527 and 8 weeks529 or 3 months528 after the end of treatment. The APS/ACP review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of PENS for acute or chronic low back pain. We also identified three trials not included in the APS/ACP review (Table 22; Appendix Tables E34, F34). One trial (n=200) compared PENS (two 30-minute sessions weekly for 6 weeks), PENS plus supervised and home exercise, control (minimal) PENS plus exercise, and control PENS alone. One trial (n=112) compared PENS (three 30-minute sessions weekly for 3 weeks) versus dry needling for chronic low back pain. 530 The other trial (n=75) compared different durations of PENS therapy (15, 30, or 45 minutes 3 times a week for 2 weeks) versus sham PENS (insertion of needles without stimulation). 531 Outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment in both trials. Among all trials, two trials were rated fair quality528, 532 and the rest were rated poor quality. Methodological shortcomings included inadequate description of randomization and allocation concealment methods, failure to report attrition, unblended or unclearly blinded design and failure to report intention-to-treat analysis. Three trials with a crossover design had a 1 week washout between treatments, but did not evaluate for potential carryover effects. 513, 527, 531 PENS V ersus Sham PENS Chronic Low Back Pain For chronic non-radicular low back pain, one fair-quality trial (n=200) found no difference between PENS versus a control (minimal) PENS intervention in pain, function, quality of life, or other outcomes at the end of a 6-week course of therapy or through 6-month followup. 532 One poor-quality trial (n=60) of patients with nonradicular low back pain513 found PENS superior to sham PENS for pain at the end of a 3-week course of therapy. The difference in mean pain scores in was about 2 points (p<0.05) on a 0-10 V AS scale. PENS was also associated with greater improvement in SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores, but effects were small (less than 7 points on a 0 to 100 scale for the physical component and <3 points for the mental component). PENS was also associated with better quality of sleep and decreased opioid use. One poor-quality trial (n=75) not included in the APS/ACP review found PENS administered for varying durations (15, 30, or 45 minutes) similarly effective versus sham PENS for pain relief. 531 Differences ranged from 3.4 to 3.9 points on a 0-10 V AS scale at the end of a 2-week course of treatment. Although the three PENS interventions were also more effective than sham PENS on the SF-36 physical and mental component scores, sleep quality, and use of nonopioid analgesics, there was some evidence of a dose threshold effect, with the 15-minute intervention associated with smaller effects than the 30- and 45-minute interventions. Radicular Low Back Pain One poor-quality trial (n=64) of patients with radiculopathy 527 found PENS superior to sham PENS for pain at the end of a 3-week course of therapy. The difference in mean pain scores in was about 2 points (p<0.05) on a 0-10 V AS scale. PENS was also associated with greater improvement in SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores, but effects were small Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.97(less than 7 points on a 0 to 100 scale for the physical component and <3 points for the mental component). PENS was also associated with better quality of sleep and decreased opioid use. PENS Plus Exercise Therapy V ersus Sham PENS Plus Exercise Therapy Chronic Low Back Pain For chronic nonradicular back pain, one fair-quality trial (n=34) included in the APS/ACP review found PENS plus physical therapy superior to sham PENS plus physical therapy for pain.528 The difference in the Multidimensional Pain Inventory pain severity score was about 1 point (0 to 6 scale) 3 months after an 8-week course of treatment. Physical therapy consisted of exercise, physical modalities, manual therapies, and education to meet patient goals. There were no differences on the RDQ, Geriatric Depression Scale, or Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. However, a fair-quality trial published subsequent to the APS/ACP review found no differences between PENS plus exercise therapy versus control (minimal) PENS plus exercise therapy in pain, the RDQ, or other outcomes through 6-month followup after a 6-week course of treatment. 532 PENS V ersus TENS Chronic Low Back Pain Three trials included in the APS/ACP review evaluated PENS versus TENS for chronic low back pain.513, 527, 529 Two poor-quality trials (n=40 and 60) each found PENS superior to TENS for pain, though effects may not be sustained. In one trial, the difference was 2.1 points on a 0-10 V AS scale at the end of a 3-week course of therapy. 513 In the other, the difference was 17 points on a 0-100 V AS scale at the end of an 8-week course of therapy (p<0.01), but the difference was smaller (6 points) and no longer statistically significant 8 weeks later. 529 Effects of therapy consisting of 4 weeks of PENS followed by 4 weeks of TENS were similar to effects of 8 weeks of TENS. PENS was also superior to sham TENS on measures of function, but neither trial reported standardized measures of back-specific function. In one trial, PENS was superior to sham PENS on the SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores, though effects were small (differences of 4.66 and 1.7 points, respectively). 513 Radicular Low Back Pain One poor-quality trial (n=64) of patients with radicular back pain included in the APS/ACP review found PENS superior to sham PENS for pain at the end of a 3-week course of therapy (difference 1.3 points on a 0-10 scale, p<0.01). 527 PENS was also superior to sham PENS on the SF-36 physical and mental component scores, though effects were small (5.7 and 2.1 points, respectively). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.98PENS V ersus Other Interventions Chronic Low Back Pain For chronic low back pain, one poor-quality trial (n=60) included in the APS/ACP review found a 3-week course of PENS more effective than a minimal exercise intervention (flexion and extension while seated) for pain (mean difference 2.1 points on a 0-10 V AS), level of activity, and quality of sleep. 513 PENS was also more effective than exercise on the SF-36 physical and mental component scores, but differences were small. A fair-quality trial (n=200) published subsequent to the APS/ACP review found no difference between PENS versus control (minimal) PENS plus exercise in pain, the RDQ, or other outcomes through 6 months followup after a 6-week course of treatment. 532 One poor-quality trial (n=112) published subsequent to the APS/ACP review of patients with chronic nonradicular back pain found no differences between a 3-week course of PENS versus dry needling in pain, the ODI, and sleep quality at the end of treatment. 530 Harms Harms were poorly reported in trials of PENS therapy. One trial reported no treatment-related adverse events, though one patient withdrew due to worsening low back pain. 532 Physical Modalities: Interferential Therapy Key Points There was insufficient evidence from four trials to determine effects of interferentialtherapy versus other interventions, or interferential therapy plus another intervention versusthe other interventions lone, due to methodological limitations and imprecision (SOE:insufficient). No study evaluated harms of interferential therapy (SOE: insufficient). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included three trials (n=151 to 240) of interferential therapy for low back pain.533-535 No trial compared interferential therapy versus sham therapy. One trial each compared interferential therapy versus spinal manipulation533 or traction.535 One of these trials also compared interferential therapy versus the combination of interferential therapy plus spinal manipulation. 533 The third trial compared interferential therapy applied to the painful area versus to the area of the spinal nerve, each in combination with a self-care book, as well as against the self-care book alone. 534 The trials focused on patients with nonradicular low back pain. The duration of symptoms was 4 to 12 weeks in two trials533, 534 and unspecified (mainly chronic) in the third.535 The trials varied in the number (range 3 to 10) and duration (10 to 30 minutes) of interferential therapy sessions and in technical parameters. Outcomes were assessed at 3 to 12 months (1 week to 10 months following the end of therapy). All of the trials were rated poor quality; methodological shortcomings included failure to blind patients or care providers, high Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.99attrition, and failure to perform intention-to-treat analysis; one trial534 also reported potentially important baseline differences. The APS/ACP review concluded that there was insufficient to determine the effectiveness of interferential therapy for acute or chronic low back pain. One trial (n=62) published subsequent to the APS/ACP review evaluated interferential therapy versus superficial massage for chronic low back pain (Table 23; Appendix Tables E35, F35). 536 Interferential therapy was administered for 30 minutes in 20 sessions over 10 weeks, with outcomes assessed at the end of therapy. The trial was rated fair quality; methodological shortcomings included unblinded design and failure to report use of cointerventions and compliance to assigned therapies. Interferential Therapy V ersus Other Interventions The two poor-quality trials included in the APS/ACP review found no differences between interferential therapy versus spinal manipulation for subacute low back pain533 or interferential therapy versus traction535 for low back pain of unspecified duration (primarily chronic) on pain, function, or other outcomes. One subsequent, fair-quality trial (n=62) found interferential therapy associated with greater improvement from baseline in pain (0-10 V AS, difference 1.06, 95% CI 1.91 to 0.22) and the RDQ (0-24, difference 3.01, 95% CI 4.53 to 1.47) versus superficial massage at the end of a 10-week course of therapy, though effects on the ODI were not statistically significant (0-100, difference 5.20, 95% CI 10.82 to 0.42) and longer-term effects were not assessed.536 There were no statistically significant differences on seven of eight SF-36 subscales. The superficial massage intervention appeared to be designed as a sham or subtherapeutic control treatment. Interferential Therapy Plus Another Intervention V ersus the Other Intervention Alone One poor-quality trial found a 3-week course of interferential therapy applied to the paraspinal area (near the target spinal nerve) plus a back self-care book associated with greater improvement in the RDQ (0-24, 6.0 vs. 4.0, p<0.05) after 3 months, though there were no differences in the McGill Pain Rating Index or the EQ-5D. 534 However, effects on the RDQ are difficult to interpret as there were baseline differences (median 9.0 vs. 5.0) and scores at 3 months were identical (1.0 vs. 1.0). There were no differences between interferential therapy applied to the painful area plus a self-care book versus the self-care book alone. One of the trials described above no differences between the combination of interferential therapy plus spinal manipulation versus manipulation alone. 533 Harms No trial of interferential therapy reported harms. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.100Physical Modalities: Superficial Heat or Cold Key Points For acute or subacute low back pain, a systematic review found a heat wrap more effective than placebo for pain relief at 5 days (2 trials, mean difference 1.06 on a 0 to 5 scale, 95%CI 0.68 to 1.45) and disability at 4 days (mean difference 2.10 on the RDQ, 95% CI 3.19to 1.01). Two subsequent trials also found a heat wrap associated with decreased painintensity at 3 to 4 days (differences 16 to 20 points on a 0- to 100-point V AS) or increasedpain relief at 8 hours (difference ~1.5 points on a 0 to 5 scale). Another trial found a heatwrap during emergency transport associated with substantially lower pain intensity versusan unheated blanket upon arrival to the hospital (SOE: moderate for pain and function). For acute low back pain, one higher-quality trial found heat plus exercise associated withgreater pain relief at day 7 (mean difference 1.40 on 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.11)and on the RDQ (mean difference 3.20 on the RDQ, 95% CI 5.42 to 0) versus exercisewithout heat (SOE: low). One fair-quality trial found heat plus an NSAID associated with better pain scores versusan NSAID without heat at day 15, based on the McGill Pain Questionnaire (scoringmethods unclear) (SOE: insufficient). For acute or subacute low back pain, a systematic review included one trial that foundheat more effective for pain relief than acetaminophen (mean difference 0.90 on a 0 to 10scale, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.30) or ibuprofen (0.65, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.05) after 1 to 2 days oftreatment; the heat wrap was also associated with greater improvement on the RDQ (meandifferences 2.00 on a 0 to 24 scale, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.14 and 2.20, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.29,respectively) (SOE: low for pain and function). For acute low back pain, a systematic review included one trial that found no cleardifferences between heat versus exercise in pain relief or function (SOE: low). No study compared superficial cold versus placebo or no cold treatment. For acute low back pain, one small trial with methodological shortcomings found cold plusnaproxen associated with better pain scores versus naproxen alone, based on the McGillPain Questionnaire (methods for scoring unclear). (SOE: insufficient). There was insufficient evidence from three trials to determine effects of heat versus cold,due to methodological limitations and imprecision (SOE: insufficient). Heat was not associated with increased risk of skin flushing versus no heat or placebo intwo trials; no serious adverse events were reported with use of heat (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included a good-quality systematic (Cochrane) review511 of nine controlled clinical trials on the effects of heat or cold on low back pain. An updated version of the review was published in 2011, but included no additional trials (Table 2; Appendix Tables Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.101E36, F36).537 Of the studies included in the systematic review, five were randomized parallel- group trials.42, 538-541 The other four used alternate allocation or did not describe the allocation method;521, 542-544 one was a parallel group trial542 and the other three used a crossover design.521, 543, 544 Four trials evaluated hot packs or heated wraps versus placebo or nonheated wraps,42, 539-541, 544 one trial heat plus exercise versus heat or exercise alone,538 one trial heat versus ibuprofen or acetaminophen,42 and two trials hot packs versus ice massage.542, 543 One trial521 compared ice massage versus TENS and is discussed in the TENS section of this report. The sample sizes ranged from between 36 and 371 participants with acute pain (1 trial); mixed acute and subacute pain (4 trials); chronic (3 trials) or mixed acute pain; and subacute and chronic (1 trial) pain. Duration of treatment was generally 1 week or less, with followup no longer than 1 or 2 days after the end of treatment. In one trial, treatment duration was 25 to 27 minutes, with immediate post-treatment followup. 541 The systematic review rated the five RCTs42, 538-541 higher quality, based on meeting at least 6 of 11 Cochrane Back Review Group criteria,545 and the remaining studies were rated lower quality.521, 542-544 All studies had methodological limitations, including unblinded design and failure to adequately report methods of randomization and allocation concealment.511 Four trials reported funding by manufacturers of heat wraps. We identified two fair-quality trials (n=30 and 51) published subsequent to the systematic review of heat therapy (4 hours daily for 4 days, 8 hours for 1 day) versus no heat therapy (Table 24; Appendix Tables E37, F37). 546, 547 One trial547 enrolled patients with acute low back pain and the other 546 included patients with acute or subacute low back pain. Methodological shortcomings included inadequate description of randomization and allocation concealment methods and nonblinded design; one trial 546 also had high (21%) attrition. Both trials were funded by a manufacturer of heat wraps. We also identified a fair-quality trial (n=87) that compared superficial heat (hot water bottle 20 minutes twice daily for 1 week) plus naproxen 500 mg bid, superficial cold (ice 20 minutes twice daily for 1 week) plus naproxen, or naproxen alone for acute low back pain 548 and a small (n=43), poor-quality trial of patients with acute low back pain in an occupational health setting evaluated3 days of heat-wrap therapy plus education versus education only through 14 days. 549 Methodological shortcomings included inadequate description of randomization and allocation concealment, failure to report attrition, and unblinded design. Heat V ersus Placebo Acute or Subacute Low Back Pain For acute or subacute low back pain, the systematic review511 found a heat wrap more effective versus placebo for short-term pain relief (mean difference at 5 days 1.06 on a 0 to 5 scale, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.45) and improvement in disability (mean difference at 4 days 2.10 on the RDQ, 95% CI 3.19 to 1.01) based on pooled results from two trials. 539, 540 Effects on pain intensity were about 10-13 points on a 0- to 100-point scale in one trial and about 0.7 to 1 point on a 0- to 10-point scale in the other trial, and effects on the RDQ were about 2-3 points in both trials. One other trial that could not be pooled found a heat wrap applied during emergency transport associated with substantial lower pain intensity upon arrival at the hospital versus an unheated blanket (mean difference from baseline 32.3 vs. 0.8 on a 0 to 100 V AS). 541 A fourth trial did not report effects on pain or disability.544 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.102A small, fair-quality trial (n=38) not included in the systematic review found a heat wrap for acute or subacute low back pain associated with decreased pain versus no heat wrap after 3 (mean 31 versus 57 on a 0 to 100 V AS; p=0.02 [data estimated from graph]) or 4 days (27 versus 47; p=0.04); effects at 1 to 2 days also favored the heat wrap, but were smaller and not statistically significant. 546 The heat wrap was also associated with lower likelihood of waking in the night due to pain at day 2 (7% [1/15] versus 53% [8/15]; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.88); no patients in the heat wrap group reported night waking on days 3 and 4 (compared with 67% and 59% of no heat wrap patients) Another fair-quality trial (n=51) found a heat wrap for acute low back pain associated with increased pain relief versus oral placebo, but only evaluated outcomes after 8 hours of treatment (mean pain relief score 3.0 vs. 1.5 on 0 [very poor] to 5 [excellent] scale). 547 Heat V ersus Another Intervention V ersus the Other Intervention Without Heat One higher-quality trial (n=100) included in the systematic review found heat plus exercise for acute low back pain superior to exercise alone for pain relief at day 7 (mean difference 1.40 on 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.11). Effects were smaller (mean differences 0.50 to 0.80) on days 2 and 4 and not statistically significant. 538 Heat plus exercise was also superior to exercise alone at day 7 (mean difference 3.20 on the RDQ, 95% CI 5.42 to 0.0), but not at day 2 (0.60, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.99) or day 4 (1.20, 95% CI 3.14 to 0.74). Two trials not included in the systematic review compared heat versus another intervention versus the other intervention without heat. A fair-quality trial (n=58) found a hot water bottle for 20 minutes plus naproxen 500 mg twice daily associated with better scores on the McGill Pain Questionnaire (scoring methods unclear). 548 A poor-quality trial (n=43) found 3 days of heat wrap therapy plus education associated with decreased pain intensity at day 3 (mean difference 2.05, 95% CI 3.34 to 0.76 on a 0 to 10 pain scale) through day 14 (mean difference 1.63, 95% CI 2.92 to 0.34) as well as RDQ (difference 2.37, 95% CI 5.62 to 0.85 at day 4 and 4.02, 95% CI 7.82 to 0.24 at day 14), versus education without heat wrap. 549 Heat V ersus Other Active Treatments For acute or subacute pain, the systematic review537 included one higher-quality trial (n=371) that found heat more effective for pain relief than acetaminophen (mean difference 0.90 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.30) or ibuprofen (0.65, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.05) after 1 to 2 days of treatment.42 The heat wrap was also associated with greater improvement on the RDQ versus acetaminophen (mean difference 2.00 on a 0 to 24 scale, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.14) and ibuprofen (2.20, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.29). 42 One higher-quality trial (n=100) included in the systematic review found small, nonstatistically significant differences favoring heat versus exercise in pain relief (mean difference 0.40 on a 0 to 10 scale at days 1 to 2, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.95; mean difference 0.30 at day 7, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28) and function (mean difference 0.70 on the RDQ at day 4, 95% CI 2.09 to 0.69; mean difference 0.90 at day 7, 95% CI 2.84 to 1.04). 538 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.103Cold V ersus Placebo No study compared cold versus placebo or no cold. Cold V ersus Another Intervention V ersus the Other Intervention Without Cold A fair-quality trial (n=58) found ice for 20 minutes plus naproxen 500 mg twice daily associated with better scores based on the McGill Pain Questionnaire (scoring methods unclear).548 Cold V ersus Other Active Treatments One lower-quality trial included in the systematic review537 found no differences between ice massage versus TENS (see the TENS section of this report.)521 Heat V ersus Cold Two lower-quality trials (n=117 and 36) included in the systematic review537 evaluated heat versus cold.542, 543 One trial found no difference between hot packs versus ice massage for back pain of mixed duration (treatment duration and followup not reported)542 and one trial found ice massage superior to hot packs for chronic pain following two 20-minute treatments.543 One fair- quality trial (n=58) not included in the systematic review found a hot water bottle twice daily for 1 week associated with no clear differences versus ice twice daily through 2 weeks, based on the McGill Pain Questionnaire (scoring methods unclear). 548 Harms The only adverse events reported in the systematic review537 were from two trials that found no difference between heat wrap versus no heat or placebo in the risk of skin flushing at the application site in two trials of heat wrap versus no heat/placebo (5% [6/128] E36). 539, 540 No serious adverse events were reported. One trial not included in the systematic review reported two cases of headache with heat, versus no cases in the oral placebo group. 547 Low-Level Laser Therapy Key Points For acute low back pain, there was insufficient evidence from one trial to determine effectiveness of low-level laser therapy versus sham laser, due to serious methodological shortcomings and imprecision (SOE: insufficient). For chronic low back pain, three of four trials found low-level laser therapy more effective than sham laser for pain, though methods for assessing pain and duration of followup varied; two trials found low-level laser therapy more effective than sham laser for function, with small magnitude of effects (SOE: low for pain and function). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.104For acute or subacute low back pain, one trial found low-level laser therapy plus an NSAID associated with lower pain intensity versus sham laser plus an NSAID or the NSAIDalone (mean differences 9 to 14 points on a 0 to 100 V AS); effects on the ODI also favoredcombination treatment but were smaller (differences <6 points) (SOE: low). For chronic low back pain, there was insufficient evidence from three trials to determineeffects of low-level laser therapy plus exercise versus the other sham laser plus exercisealone, due to methodological shortcomings and inconsistency (SOE: insufficient). There was insufficient evidence to determine effects of low-level laser therapy versusanother intervention, due to methodological shortcomings and imprecision (SOE:insufficient). There was insufficient evidence to determine effects of different wavelengths of low-levellaser therapy or different doses, due to methodological limitations and imprecision (SOE:insufficient). Harms were not well-reported in trials of low-level laser therapy, but no serious adverseevents and no harms were reported (SOE: low) Detailed Synthesis Low level laser therapy involves administration of a single wavelength of light (usually from 632 to 904 nm) that does not emit heat but may affect underlying connective tissues and have potential anti-inflammatory effects. The APS/ACP review 29 included seven trials550-556 of low-level laser therapy for low back pain. Four trials were conducted in patients with chronic low back pain, one trial in patients with acute low back pain, and two trials did not specify the duration of symptoms. The APS/ACP review found insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness of low-level laser therapy versus sham or other interventions, due to variability across trials in terms of laser types and doses, outcomes, duration of followup, and inconsistency in results. A recent systematic review 557 included six550-555 of the trials included in the APS/ACP review plus one additional trial (Table 2).558 We also identified five recently published trials not included in prior reviews (Table 25; Appendix Tables E38, F38).559-563 In total, after excluding one poor-quality trial with uninterpretable findings,556 10 trials assessed low-level laser therapy for low back pain.550-555, 558-563 Laser wavelengths ranged from 830 to 10600 nm and five of the trials used a 904 nm laser.551, 552, 555, 560, 562 Duration of treatment ranged from 1 day to 6 weeks, followup was from 1 day to 1 year, and there were 6 to 20 laser treatment sessions (1 trial 555 did not report the treatment protocol and 1 trial553 assessed outcomes after a single treatment). Five trials compared laser versus sham550-553, 559 and two trials compared different laser doses, either with555 or without562 a sham group. The other five trials compared laser plus another treatment (heat, exercise, or NSAID) versus the other treatment, either alone or in combination with sham laser. 554, 558, 560, 561, 563 Sample sizes in nine of the trials ranged from 20 to 120 and in the tenth (largest) study was 546.560 Patients had chronic low back pain in seven trials550-552, 554, 558, 559, 563 and acute low back pain in three trials.555, 560, 562 One trial enrolled both subacute and chronic pain patients561 and one trial did not report the duration of pain.553 Two trials560, 561 were rated good quality, two554, 555 poor quality, and eight trials fair quality. Methodological limitations in the fair- and poor-quality studies included inadequate reporting of Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.105treatment allocation, unblinded design, use of cointerventions, unclear or low compliance, and high or unclear attrition. Low-Level Laser Therapy V ersus Sham or Placebo Acute Low Back Pain One poor-quality trial (n=120) of patients with acute low back pain compared two different laser wavelengths versus sham.555 A higher proportion of patients in both active laser groups reported effective (undefined) treatment versus sham, with no difference among active groups, but point estimates were very imprecise. The number of treatments given in each group was not reported. Chronic Low Back Pain Three fair-quality trials 550, 552, 553 included in the APS/ACP review found laser more effective than sham treatment for pain and disability. All three trials (n=41 to 71)550, 552, 553 reported significant differences between laser and sham for pain outcomes, though duration of followup (range 1 day to 6 months) and methods for assessing pain varied among the trials. One trial found a higher proportion of laser-treated patients reported >60% pain relief after 2 weeks of treatment (71% [27/38] vs. 36% [12/33]; RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.21) 552 and another found laser associated with higher likelihood of \"effective\" (undefined) treatment (94% [15/16] vs. 48% [12/25]; RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.99). 553 The third trial reported significantly different mean pain V AS scores (scale 0 to 100) between laser and sham after 4 weeks (19.1 vs. 35.1; mean difference 16.00, 95% CI 27.95 to 4.05). 550 One additional fair-quality trial (n=60) published subsequent to the APS/ACP review found no difference in improvement in V AS pain scores between laser versus sham laser after 2 weeks of treatment (0-10 scale, difference -0.3, 95% CI -1.0 to 0.3). 559 One trial included in the APS/ACP review and one subsequent trial found low-level laser therapy associated with significantly better ODI scores versus sham (14.7 vs. 22.9; mean difference 8.20, 95% CI 13.44 to 2.96 550 and mean difference CI -0.6 to -0.1 [scale unclear]559). Low-Level Laser Therapy Plus Another Intervention V ersus the Other Intervention Without Low-Level Laser Therapy Acute or Subacute Low Back Pain Two good-quality trials (n=80 and 546)560, 561 assessed low-level laser therapy for acute or subacute low back pain. The larger trial found low-level laser therapy plus an NSAID, versus sham laser plus an NSAID or the NSAID alone, associated with improved pain (mean change 30.0 vs. 15.7 vs. 20.8 on 0 to 100 V AS), function (mean change 12.0 vs. 6.5 vs. 10.0 on the ODI) and the SF-36 physical component score (4 vs. 2 vs. 3 on a 0 to 100 scale) after 3 weeks of treatment, although differences in disability and quality of life scores were small (<6 points on the ODI and 1 to 2 points on the SF-36 physical component score). 560 The smaller (n=80) trial found no difference between low-level laser therapy plus heat versus sham plus heat in pain (mean change from baseline 4.0 vs. 4.15 on 0 to 10 V AS; p=0.07) or disability (RDQ Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.106mean change from baseline -6.0 vs. 5.65; p=0.39; ODI mean change from baseline 8.2 vs. 8.7; p=0.15); patient global assessment of pain was significantly worse with laser versus sham (mean change from baseline 3.0 vs. 4.7; p=0.006.) 561 Chronic Low Back Pain Four trials compared low-level laser therapy plus another intervention versus the other intervention alone for chronic low back pain.551, 558, 561, 563 A good-quality trial (n=40) found laser plus heat associated with smaller improvements versus sham laser plus heat in pain scores (mean change 3.35 versus 3.95 on a 0 to 10 scale; p=0.03) and physician global assessment of pain (mean change 3.15 versus 4.05; p=0.01) at 3 weeks, 561 but differences were small (less than 1 point on a 0 to 10 scale).564 Low-level laser therapy plus heat was associated with greater improvement in the RDQ (mean change 6.7 vs. 4.65 on a 0 to 24 scale; p>0.05) and modified ODI (mean change 9.6 vs. 6.2 on a 0 to 50 scale; p>0.05) versus sham laser plus heat. Three fair-quality trials compared low level laser therapy plus exercise versus sham laser plus exercise for chronic low back pain. 551, 558, 563 The one small trial (n=20) found no differences in pain (mean change 1.3 vs. 1.2 on 0 to 7.5 scale; p=0.5) or the RDQ (mean change 1.8 vs. 3.0, p=0.9) at 1-month followup. 551 However, two other trials (n=54 and 100) found the combination associated with lower pain intensity (2.4 vs. 4.3 at 12 weeks; p=0.0005558 and 2.68 vs. 4.08 at 3 weeks on a 0 to 10 V AS563) and disability (16.8 vs. 24.1 on the 0 to 50 modified ODI; p=0.0001558). Low-Level Laser Therapy V ersus Other Interventions The APS/ACP review included two poor-quality trials of low-level laser therapy versus other interventions, though one was uninterpretable due to methodologic and reporting limitations.556 The other trial (n=75) found no differences between low-level laser therapy versus exercise in pain (mean change 4.2 vs. 3.60 on 0 to 10 V AS) or disability (mean change 16.4 vs. 16.9 on modified ODI). 554 A trial not included in the APS/ACP review found no difference between low- level laser therapy versus sham laser plus exercise for pain (4.4 vs. 4.3 on 0 to 10 V AS; p=0.87) or disability (20.8 vs. 24.1 on modified ODI; p=0.06). Low-Level Laser Therapy V ersus Low-Level Laser Therapy One fair-quality trial (n=66) found no differences between 904 nm laser therapy at doses of 0.1, 1.0, and 4.0 joules per point (corresponding to 0.4, 4.0, and 16.0 joules daily) in pain scores after 2 weeks of followup, but 16.0 joules daily was associated with better functional outcomes related to walking (p=0.007), sitting (p=0.005), and standing (p=0.013) versus the lower doses.562 A poor-quality trial (n=120) found no difference between 904 nm versus 10600 nm low-level laser therapy in the likelihood of experiencing complete resolution of pain at 1-month followup (95% vs. 83%; RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.35.) 555 Harms Harms were not well-reported in trials of low-level laser therapy. The APS/ACP review29 reported no harms associated with low-level laser therapy. Three subsequent trials described no Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.107adverse events (including local adverse events), without providing further data.558, 560, 562 One trial reported two withdrawals due to worsening pain across groups.562 Short-Wave Diathermy Key Points For back pain of mixed duration, there was insufficient evidence from five RCTs to determine effects of short-wave diathermy versus sham diathermy, due to methodologicallimitations and imprecision (SOE: insufficient). No study evaluated harms of short-wave diathermy. Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included three trials (n=24 to 400) of short-wave for low compared short-wave diathermy diathermy and all trials compared diathermy versus other interventions (exercises,565 traction,565 or manipulation450 , 475). The trials focused on patients with nonradicular low back pain. One trial enrolled patients with acute (<3 weeks) back pain,450 one trial patients with low back pain for 2 to 12 months,(Gibson) and the third patients with back pain for >1 week.565 The trials varied in the number of sessions (6, 12, or not specified); only one trial565 specified the duration of each session (20 minutes). Outcomes were assessed at the end of a 2-week course of therapy in two trials 450, 565 and at 12 weeks (8 weeks after the end of therapy) in the third trial.475 Two trials475, 565 were rated fair quality and one trial450 poor quality; methodological shortcomings included unclear randomization and allocation concealment methods, failure to blind care providers and outcome assessors, and failure to report use of cointerventions and compliance. The poor-quality trial also did not blind patients. The APS/ACP review found insufficient evidence to determine effects of short-wave diathermy for acute or chronic low back pain. Two trials (n=97 and 102) published subsequent to the APS/ACP review evaluated short-wave diathermy versus sham diathermy for chronic low back pain 26; Appendix Tables E39, F39). 566, 567 Short-wave diathermy was administered for 15 minutes in 18 sessions over 6 weeks, with outcomes assessed at the end of therapy. Both trials were rated poor quality; methodological shortcomings included unclear randomization and allocation concealment methods, failure to report attrition, lack of intention-to-treat analysis, and failure to blind caregivers and outcome assessors. Short-Wave Diathermy V ersus Sham Diathermy Mixed Duration Low Back Pain Two fair-quality trials included in the APS/ACP review found no difference between 2 weeks of short-wave diathermy versus sham diathermy. In one trial of patients with low back pain for 2 to 12 months, short-wave diathermy was not superior to sham diathermy in median pain scores, the proportion free of pain, or the proportion with work or activity limitations through 12 weeks, with some trends favoring sham therapy. 475 In a trial of patients with back pain for >1 week, there Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.108was no difference in the likelihood of a positive global response at the end of therapy (39% vs. 37%, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.50).565 Two subsequent, poor-quality trials each found short-wave diathermy for chronic low back pain associated with better pain scores at the end of a 6-week course of therapy. 566, 567 However, in addition to the methodological shortcomings in the trials, they also used a nonstandardized method to assess pain (sum of Lattinen' s score plus tenderness score plus 0-10 V AS). Other outcomes were not assessed. Short-Wave Diathermy V ersus Other Interventions Mixed Duration Low Back Pain Two fair-quality trials included in the prior APS/ACP review found no differences between a 2-week course of short-wave diathermy versus spinal manipulation475 in pain, use of analgesics, or work or activity limitations through 12 weeks or versus extension exercises or traction565 in the likelihood of a positive global effect at the end of therapy. A small (n=24), poor-quality trial of patients with acute low back pain found short-wave diathermy associated with a lower likelihood of being \"fully restored\" than spinal manipulation at the end of a 2-week course of therapy (25% vs. 92%, RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.74). 450 Harms No trial of short-wave diathermy reported harms. Lumbar Supports Key Points For acute or subacute low back pain, there was insufficient evidence from five trials todetermine effects of lumbar supports versus no lumbar supports or an inactive treatment,due to methodological shortcomings and inconsistent results (SOE: insufficient). For chronic low back pain, there was insufficient evidence from two trials to determineeffects of lumbar supports versus no lumbar supports, due to methodological shortcomingsand inconsistent results (SOE: insufficient). For back pain of mixed duration, one trial found an inextensible but not extensible lumbarsupport associated with greater improvement in function versus no lumbar support, buteffects were small. There was no clear effect on function (SOE: low). For acute or subacute low back pain, one trial found no differences between a lumbarsupport plus an education program versus an education program alone in pain or functionafter 1 year (SOE: low for pain and function). For chronic low back pain, one trial found no difference between a lumbar support plusexercise (muscle strengthening) versus exercise alone in short-term (8 weeks) or long-term(6 months) pain or function (SOE: low for pain and function). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.109 Three trials found no clear differences between lumbar supports versus other active treatments in pain or function (SOE: low for pain and function).There was insufficient evidence from 3 trials to determine comparative effects of different types of lumbar supports for chronic low back pain or back pain of mixed duration, due to heterogeneous comparisons, methodological shortcomings and imprecision (SOE: insufficient). Trials reported no harms associated with use of lumbar supports (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included good-quality systematic review44 with six trials39, 568-572 of lumbar supports for low back pain. Sample sizes ranged from 19 to 456 subjects. One of the trials was classified as high quality. 569 The APS/ACP review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine effects of lumbar supports for acute or chronic low back pain. An updated version of the systematic review573 with two additional trials574, 575 (eight total) has since been published (Table 2; Appendix Tables E40, F40). Six trials compared lumbar supports versus no lumbar supports,3 9, 568, 569, 571, 572, 575 three trials lumbar supports versus other active interventions (e.g., spinal manipulation therapy, exercise, massage),39, 568, 569, 575 and two trials compared different types of lumbar supports570, 574 The types of lumbar supports included flexible and semi-rigid corset made of various materials and a pneumatic lumbar support. Duration of treatment ranged from 3 weeks to 2 months. Trials evaluated patients at the end of treatment; three trials 39, 568, 574 also evaluated patients 6 to 16 months after the end of treatment. Three trials enrolled patients with chronic pain570, 574, 575 and four enrolled patients with low back pain of mixed duration;39, 568, 569, 572 one trial571 did not report the duration of pain. Sample sizes ranged from 19 to 456 (total n=1,361). All of the studies except for one569 were rated lower quality by the systematic review, based on meeting at least 5 of 10 Cochrane Back Review Group criteria.545 Methodological shortcomings in the trials included failure to describe adequate randomization and allocation concealment methods, lack of blinding of outcome assessors, inadequate or unclear compliance, and possible differential use of cointerventions. 573 We identified three trials (n=50, 98 and 217) published since the updated Cochrane review of lumbar supports versus no support for subacute,576 chronic,577 or mixed duration low back pain578 and one trial (n=433) of lumbar supports plus education versus education alone for acute or subacute low back pain 579 (Table 27; Appendix Tables E41, F41). One of the trials also compared two types of lumbar supports (inextensible [stiffer] versus extensible).578 Treatment duration was 2 weeks, 3 months, or 6 months in three trials, with followup up through the end of treatment. The fourth trial did not report treatment duration, but followed patients for 1 year. All four trials were rated fair quality; methodological limitations included unclear allocation concealment methods, unclear compliance and unblended design. Lumbar Support V ersus No Lumbar Support or an Inactive Therapy Acute or Subacute Low Back Pain The systematic review573 included four trials of lumbar supports versus no lumbar support or an inactive therapy (light massage)569 for acute or subacute low back pain. Meta-analysis was not performed due to clinical heterogeneity. One higher-quality trial (n=164)569 and two lower-quality Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.110trials (n=334 and 456)39, 568 found no difference between lumbar supports versus no lumbar support in pain. The fourth, a lower-quality trial (n=216), found lumbar supports associated with higher likelihood of improvement in pain (95% [106/111] vs. 77% [79/103]; RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.40). 572 Only one trial evaluated function using standardized measures; it found no differences between a corset versus light message on the RDQ or ODI.569 Evidence on return to work was mixed in two lower-quality trials one trial found no difference between lumbar support versus no support in time to return to work, 568 while the other trial found lumbar supports associated with greater likelihood of return to work at 3 weeks (85% [94/111] vs. 67% [70/105]; RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.49). 572 Two lower-quality trials (n=790) reported no difference in measures of global improvement.39, 568 A fair-quality trial (n=217) published subsequent to the systematic review evaluated lumbar supports versus no lumbar support for subacute low back pain.576 It found lumbar supports associated with greater improvement in pain after 30 days (mean change 26.8 vs. 21.3; p=0.04) and 90 days (mean change 41.5 vs. 32.0; p=0.002) of use. Lumbar supports were also associated with greater improvement in function, based on the EIFEL score (mean change 5.4 vs. 4.0 at 30 days on a 0 to 24 scale; p=0.02 and 7.6 vs. 6.1 at 90 days; p=0.02). Mixed Duration Low Back Pain One fair-quality trial (n=98) of patients with acute to chronic low back pain found an inextensible lumbar support associated with better scores on the ODI (mean difference 9.4, 95% CI 2.2 to 16.6) and the Patient Specific Activity Scale (mean difference -1.4 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI -2.3 to -0.4) and greater likelihood of 50 percent improvement in the ODI (RR 3.40, 95% CI 1.07 to 10.8) versus no lumbar support after 2 weeks of therapy among patients who also underwent physical therapy. 578 Effects on pain were small (<1 point on a 0-10 NRS) and were not statistically significant. Differences between an extensible lumbar support versus no lumbar support were smaller and did not reach statistical significance. Chronic Low Back Pain One lower-quality trial (n=79) 575 of lumbar supports versus no support for chronic pain found no differences in pain or functional outcomes after 2 months of treatment.573 A small trial (n=50) published since the systematic review found use of lumbar supports associated with better pain and functional outcomes versus no lumbar support at 1 month (p<0.01; no data reported) based on assessment using the Japanese Orthopedic Association criteria, but effects were not sustained after 3 and 6 months of use. 577 Lumbar Support Plus Another Intervention V ersus the Other Intervention Without Lumbar Support Acute and Subacute Low Back Pain One fair-quality trial (n=433) published subsequent to the systematic review found no differences between a lumbar support plus an education program versus an education program alone in pain or function after 1 year, in patients with acute or subacute work-related back pain. 579 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.111Chronic Low Back Pain One small, lower-quality trial (n=63) included in the systematic review found no difference between a lumbar support plus exercise (muscle strengthening) versus exercise alone in short- term (8 weeks) or long-term (6 months) pain or function.574 Lumbar Support V ersus Other Treatments Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Low Back Pain The systematic review included one higher-quality (n=164)569 and two lower-quality (n=334 and lumbar supports versus other active treatments.573 None of the trials found a significant difference among lumbar supports and other treatments, including traction, spinal manipulation, exercise, physiotherapy or TENS, and pain outcomes. For function, results from the higher-quality trial were mixed, 569 with the lumbar support associated with better function versus spinal manipulation or transcutaneous muscle stimulation based on the RDQ, but no difference based on the ODI. There were no differences between lumbar supports and other active treatment for either time to return to work (1 trial) or global improvement (2 trials). 573 One Type of Lumbar Support V ersus Another Chronic or Mixed Duration Low Back Pain For chronic low back pain, one trial (n=79; lower quality) included in the systematic review573 found no differences between a flexible versus semi-rigid corset in pain or functional outcomes after 2 months of use. 575 Another, small (n=19), lower-quality trial included in the systematic review found a lumbar support plus nonsupportive corset associated with greater improvement in short-term pain and back-specific function after 8 weeks followup versus the nonsupportive corset alone. 570 A fair-quality trial (n=98) of patients with back pain of mixed duration found no clear differences between an inextensible versus extensible lumbar support in pain or the ODI after 2 weeks, though effects on the ODI favored the inextensible support (difference 4.1 points, 95% CI -2.8 to 11.1). 578 Harms No harms associated with use of lumbar supports were reported in the systematic review, and none of the four subsequent trials, though harms were not well reported.576-579 Traction Key Findings For low back pain with or without radicular symptoms, a systematic review included 13trials that found no clear differences with inconsistent effects of traction versus placebo,sham, or no treatment in pain, function, or other outcomes, though two trials reportedfavorable effects on pain in patients with radicular back pain (SOE: insufficient for painand function). Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.112For low back pain with or without radicular symptoms, a systematic review included five trials that found no clear differences between traction versus physiotherapy versusphysiotherapy alone (SOE: low). For low back pain with or without radicular symptoms, a systematic review included 15trials of traction versus other interventions that found no clear between traction versusother active interventions in pain or function (SOE: low for pain and function). A systematic review included five trials that found no clear differences between differenttypes of traction (SOE: low). Eleven trials of traction in a systematic review reported no adverse events or no differencein risk of adverse events versus placebo or other interventions. Three subsequent trialsreported findings consistent with the systematic review (SOE: low). Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review29 included a large, good-quality systematic review580 with 23 trials of traction versus sham or no treatment, sham versus other interventions, or one type of traction versus another. The review was subsequently updated to include 32 trials with 2,762 patients (Table 2; Appendix Tables E42, F42). 581 Thirteen compared traction versus placebo, sham traction, or no treatment; 15 trials compared traction versus other active treatments (including exercise [6 trials], heat therapy [2 trials], or other passive physical modalities [7 trials]); and five trials compared one type of traction versus another. Ten trials assessed participants with chronic pain and participants with subacute pain were included in one trial. In the remaining trials, duration of pain was mixed (17 trials) or not clearly reported (5 trials). Of the 32 included trials, 23 enrolled populations with radicular low back pain. Among the other nine studies, eight enrolled a mixed population with radicular and nonradicular pain and one enrolled only patients with nonradicular low back pain. Duration of followup ranged from 1 week to 1 year. Only three studies 460, 582, 583 reported outcomes beyond 6 months followup. Sixteen of the 32 included trials were judged to have a low risk of bias (i.e., quality score 6/12.) We also identified three trials (in four publications) not included in the updated systematic review (Table 28; Appendix Tables E43, F43).584-587 Each trial (n=24 to 80) compared combination treatment with traction plus another active intervention versus the active intervention alone. None of the trials clearly stated the duration of low back pain in study participants, but inclusion criteria for two trials 584-586 required 3 months or more of pain at baseline (subacute/chronic) and the third587 required no more than 6 months of pain at baseline (acute/subacute). Two trials compared 10 weeks of traction in combination with usual care (infrared lamp and stretching 584, 585 or hot packs and interferential therapy586) versus usual care alone. The third trial compared inversion traction plus physiotherapy with physiotherapy alone. 587 Study participants received treatment for 10 weeks in two trials584-586 and for 4 weeks in the third,587 with respective followup of 6 months and 56 weeks. Two trials were rated fair quality584-586 and one poor quality.587 Methodological shortcomings included unblinded design and in the case of the poor-quality study,587 inadequate description of randomization and allocation concealment techniques, and incomplete followup.

There were also no significant differences between traction versus placebo, sham or no treatment in functional status, global improvement, or return to work after 3 weeks to 6 months, though evidence was limited to one to four trials for each outcome. Among the trials not included in meta-analyses, there was no significant difference at 3- to 5-week followup in pain, 582, 588 functional status,588 or global improvement.588, 589 Traction Plus Another Intervention V ersus Another Intervention Alone Low Back Pain With or Without Radiculopathy The systematic review found few differences between traction plus another intervention versus the other intervention alone in pain, function, or global improvement for nonradicular or radicular low back pain based on five trials. All five trials compared traction plus physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone, though evidence was limited to one to two trials for outcome and time point. 581 Two trials published subsequent to the systematic review evaluated traction plus an active \"usual care\" intervention (infrared lamp and stretching or hot packs and interferential therapy) versus the usual care intervention alone. 584-586 One trial (n=80) found traction associated with better pain scores at 10 weeks (mean difference 1.20 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 1.87 to 0.53) and 6 months (mean difference 0.90, 95% CI 1.41 to 0.39) and improved function (mean difference in ODI scores 1.60 on 0 to 100 scale at 6 weeks, 95% CI 1.41 to 0.39 and 3.30 at 6 months, 95% CI 4.57 to 2.03). 584, 585 The other trial (n=64) found traction associated with better pain scores (mean difference 2.20 on 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 2.79 to 1.62) and function (mean difference 8.10 on the ODI, 95% CI 9.60 to 6.60) at 6 months, though the differences were small. 586 A small (n=24), poor-quality trial of traction plus physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone for radicular low back pain found no differences in pain, disability, or quality-of-life scores after 4 weeks of treatment and 6 weeks of followup, though traction was associated with lower likelihood of back surgery (23% vs. 82%; RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.79.) 587 Traction V ersus Other Active Treatments Low Back Pain With or Without Radiculopathy Although the updated systematic review included 15 trials of traction versus other active interventions, few of the included trials provided data suitable for inclusion in meta-analysis.581 The review found no differences between traction versus other active treatments in two trials of low back pain with radicular symptoms (followup at 1 to 16 weeks) or in four trials of patients Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.114with low back pain with or without radicular symptoms (followup at 1 year) in pain, functional status, and global improvement. We identified no trial published subsequent to the systematic review on traction versus other active treatments. One Type of Traction V ersus Another Low Back Pain With or Without Radiculopathy Five trials included in the updated systematic review compared different types of traction.581 For low back pain of varying duration with or without radicular symptoms, one trial (n=26) found no difference between static versus intermittent traction in the likelihood of experiencing global improvement after 1 to 2 weeks (risk difference 0.08, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.30) 590 and one trial (n=67) found autotraction superior to mechanical traction (risk difference 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.73.)591 For radicular low back pain, there were no differences among different types of traction (autotraction versus manual or mechanical land-based traction [1 pain scores (3 trials; mean difference 6.58, 95% CI 2.77 to 16) or likelihood of global improvement (1 trial; risk difference 0.16, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.09.) Harms Eleven (of 32) studies included in the updated systematic review581 reported adverse events; of those, four reported no events in either group. In the other seven trials, most found no difference between traction versus placebo or other treatments in risk of adverse events (including aggravation or worsening of symptoms), or with one type of traction versus another. However, one trial found inversion traction associated with increased likelihood of worsened pain versus conventional traction, although the estimate was imprecise (79% [11/14]) versus 15% [2/13]; RR 5.00, 95% CI 1.39 to 19.) Three trials published subsequent to the updated systematic review did not report adverse events 584-586 or reported no adverse events.587 Taping Key Points For chronic low back pain, three trials found no differences between a Kinesio Taping\u00ae versus sham taping in back-specific function after 5 to 12 weeks; effects on pain were inconsistent(SOE: low for function, insufficient for pain). For chronic low back pain, there was insufficient evidence from 1 trial to determine effects ofFunctional Fascial Taping plus exercise versus sham taping plus exercise, due to methodologicallimitations and imprecision (SOE: insufficient). For chronic low back pain, two trials found no differences between Kinesio Taping\u00ae versus exercise therapy in pain or function (SOE: low for pain and function). No trial of taping reported harms. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.115Detailed Synthesis The APS/ACP review did not evaluate taping for low back pain. We identified six trials on the effects of taping (Table 29; Appendix Tables E44, F44).592-597 Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 60 in five trials and was 148 in the fifth trial.597 Five trials evaluated Kinesio Taping\u00ae592, 593, 595-597 and trials of Kinesio Taping592, 593, 597 and the trial of Functional Fascial Taping\u00ae594 evaluated a sham taping (taping applied without tension) comparison. In the Functional Fascial Taping trial, patients in both groups also received instruction in home trunk flexion exercises. Among the Kinesio Taping trials, one trial595 compared Kinesio Taping versus exercise therapy without Kinesio Taping, one trial596 compared Kinesio Taping versus exercise therapy or the combination of taping and exercise, and one trial592 compared Kinesio Taping plus physical therapy (hot pack, ultrasound, and TENS) versus sham taping plus physical therapy. The five trials of Kinesio Taping enrolled patients with chronic low back pain and the trial of Functional Fascial Taping enrolled patients with back pain for >6 weeks, though the median duration was 32 to 39 weeks. The taping techniques all involved some degree of tension, though the taping pattern, reapplication interval, and duration of treatment (7 days to 12 weeks) varied. Outcomes were assessed at the end of a 4-week course of therapy in two trials 595, 596 and at 5 to 12 weeks (4 to 10 weeks after the end of therapy in three trials and at the end of therapy in one trial592). Two trials were rated good quality,593, 597 three fair quality,592, 594, 596 and one poor quality.595 Methodological shortcomings in the fair- and poor-quality trials included unclear randomization and allocation concealment methods, unblinded design, failure to report attrition, and unclear use of intention-to-treat analysis. Taping V ersus Sham Taping Chronic Low Back Pain Two good-quality trials (n=60 and 148) and one fair-quality trial (n=20) found no differences between a Kinesio Taping\u00ae versus sham taping in back-specific function (RDQ or ODI) after 5 weeks (following 1 week of therapy)593 or 12 weeks (following 4 or 12 weeks of therapy).592, 597 Effects on pain were somewhat mixed, with one trial finding a 1-week course of taping associated with greater improvement in pain (mean difference, 0-10 V AS 1.0, 95% CI 1.7 to 0.2) after 5 weeks, 593 but two trials finding no effect of a 4-week course of taping (mean difference, 0-10 V AS 0.5, 95% CI 1.4 to 0.4)597 or a 12-week course of taping (mean, 0-10 V AS 5.07 vs. 5.14).592 Taping Plus Exercise V ersus Exercise Alone Chronic Low Back Pain A fair-quality trial (n=43) found no difference between 2 weeks of Functional Fascial Taping plus exercise versus sham taping plus exercise in pain or ODI scores when outcomes were assessed at 6 or 10 weeks. 594 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.116Taping V ersus Exercise Chronic Low Back Pain One fair-quality (n=39)596 and one poor-quality (n=40) trial595 found no differences between a 4-week course of Kinesio Taping\u00ae versus exercise therapy in pain or the RDQ when outcomes were assessed at the end of therapy. Differences in pain scores favored taping by less than 1 point on a 0-10 scale, though effects on the RDQ were in opposite directions (favored taping in one trial and exercise in the other). One of the trials also found no differences between taping and taping plus exercise. Harms No trial of taping reported harms. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old.

For chronic LBP, NSAIDs associated with greater improvement in pain vs. placebo (4 trials, WMD -12.40, 95% CI -15.53 to -9.26). For radicular LBP, there was no difference in pain intensity between NSAIDs versus placebo. There was no difference in likelihood of pain relief for rofecoxib vs. diolefin.

Acupuncture + meds (n=1, 24 patients) F. meds alone (n=1, 25 patients)Moderate evidence of benefit in global improvement with acupuncture compared with NSAIDs, but the effect is very small. Inconsistent benefit of acupuncture compared with NSAIDs in terms of pain relief. Real acupuncture may be more effective than sham at reducing acute pain, but the effect is small and there appears to be no benefit in terms of function. Acupuncture in addition to medication appears more effective for pain relief and function than medication alone, but these differences are small.

Patients who received acupuncture in addition to usual care had greater pain relief and improved function immediately postintervention and at followup compared with those who received usual care alone. Patients who received electroacupuncture reported significantly less pain and levels of activity limitation than the control group immediately postintervention and at followup. There was no evidence that acupuncture was better than TENS. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old.

Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.204Discussion Key Findings and Strength of Evidence The key findings or this review, including strength of evidence ratings are summarized in the summary of evidence table (Table 30); the factors used to determine the overall strength of evidence are summarized in Appendix H. This report updates a previous review that we conducted 15, 16 for the American College of Physicians and American Pain Society, expanding upon it with new evidence and evaluation of several additional interventions (e.g., tai chi, taping, electrical muscle stimulation). This report also incorporates evidence on new drugs within previously reviewed classes (e.g., the antidepressant duloxetine and the antiseizure medication pregabalin). Because of the large number of interventions addressed in this review, reviewing all of the primary literature was not feasible. Therefore, we used relevant, well-conducted systematic reviews when available, including updates of systematic reviews included in our prior report, and supplemented prior reviews with additional trials that were published subsequent to the reviews or not included for other reasons. All conclusions are based on the totality of evidence (i.e., studies included in systematic reviews plus additional primary studies). Across interventions, pain intensity was the most commonly reported outcome, followed by back-specific function (typically measured using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire [RDQ] or the Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]). When present, observed benefits were generally in the small (5 to 10 points on a 100-point visual analogue scale [V AS] or equivalent or standardized mean difference [SMD] of 0.2 to 0.5) to moderate (10 to 20 points, or SMD of 0.5 to 0.8) range for pain. Effects on function were typically smaller than effects on pain; in some cases there were positive effects on pain but not on function, and fewer studies measured function than pain. Other outcomes (such as quality of life, mood, work, analgesic use, or utilization of resources) were generally reported inconsistently and data were too sparse to reach reliable conclusions. New evidence affected conclusions for several classes of medications. For acetaminophen, the prior review concluded that acetaminophen was effective for acute low back pain, primarily based on indirect evidence from trials of acetaminophen for other conditions and trials of acetaminophen versus other analgesics. However, a recent, well-conducted trial\u2014the first placebo-controlled trial in patients with acute low back pain\u2014found acetaminophen to be no more than effective than placebo (strength of evidence [SOE]: low). 43 For antidepressant drugs, no studies in the prior review evaluated drugs in the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor class. Evidence from several trials indicates that duloxetine is more effective than placebo for pain and function in patients with chronic low back pain (SOE: moderate). 152-154 However, effects were small (less than 1 point on a 0 to 10 scale) and all trials were funded by the manufacturer of duloxetine and led by the same researcher. For antiseizure medications, new evidence is available on pregabalin for radicular low back pain, but the studies had methodological shortcomings and were too inconsistent to reliably estimate effects (SOE: insufficient). 160, 163 The prior review found no studies on the effects of benzodiazepines for radiculopathy; one recent trial found that benzodiazepines were no more effective than placebo in for this condition (SOE: low). 135 The trial also found that for some outcomes, such as return to work, benzodiazepines were associated with worse outcomes versus placebo. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.205Main conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of pharmacological therapies for low back pain were otherwise relatively unchanged from the prior review. One area in which conclusions did change was related to effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants. In our prior review, tricyclic antidepressants were found to be associated with small beneficial effects for chronic low back pain. However, evidence reviewed for this report suggests that tricyclic antidepressants are not effective versus placebo (4 95% CI 0.51 to 0.31; a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is not associated with the anticholinergic and cardiac side effects of tricyclics, is now available as a potential alternative antidepressant. Skeletal muscle relaxants appear to be effective for short-term pain relief in patients with acute low back pain, but are also associated with an increased risk of central nervous system adverse events (in particular, sedation) (SOE: moderate). Systemic corticosteroids do not appear to be effective versus placebo for either radicular or nonradicular low back pain (SOE: moderate) and evidence on the effectiveness of benzodiazepines versus placebo for nonradicular low back pain remains sparse (SOE: insufficient). 34 Evidence on the effectiveness of opioids for low back pain remains limited to short-term trials showing modest effects versus placebo on short-term pain and function69 (SOE: moderate). Almost all trials of opioids enrolled patients with chronic low back pain, and no trial focused on patients with radicular symptoms. There remain no clear differences among different long-acting opioids or among long- versus short-acting opioids. Findings regarding the increased risk of opioids versus placebo for harms such as constipation, nausea, sedation, and dry mouth are also unchanged. Most trials of opioids used an enriched enrollment and withdrawal design; evidence from studies of chronic pain in general (not restricted to low back pain) suggest that estimates of harms are larger in trials that did not use such a design. 92 Trials of opioids for low back pain were not designed to assess risk of serious adverse events such as overdose, abuse or addiction, or accidental injuries, due to their relatively small samples and short duration of followup. In addition, trials of opioids typically excluded patients with risk factors for overdose, abuse, or addiction. Observational studies have shown an association between use of opioids for chronic pain and serious harms such as overdose that appears to be dose-dependent. 599 However, such studies did not meet inclusion criteria for this report because they were not restricted to patients with low back pain. Relatively few studies directly compared the effectiveness of different medications for low back pain, or the effectiveness of a combination of medications versus one of the component medications of the combination alone. We found no clear differences between opioids versus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in pain relief or function, and no clear differences between benzodiazepines versus skeletal muscle relaxants. As described above, there were no clear differences between acetaminophen versus NSAIDs in patients with chronic low back pain. Serious harms were generally not observed in trials of nonopioid medications, though harms were generally not reported well. Like trials of opioids, trials of nonopioid medications were not designed to assess risk of serious, uncommon harms (e.g., liver toxicity with acetaminophen, bleeding with NSAIDs, fracture or infection with corticosteroids, or abuse or addiction with benzodiazepines).

Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.206The current report addresses several nonpharmacological therapies not addressed in the prior APS/ACP review. Evidence on taping (using techniques to increase skin tension) did not clearly show beneficial effects versus sham taping comparisons, though findings were limited by methodological shortcomings and inconsistency (SOE: insufficient to low). There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of electrical muscle stimulation, due to methodological shortcomings in the trials and imprecision (SOE: insufficient). Two trials found that tai chi was more effective versus wait list control for pain intensity and function285 (SOE: low); effects appeared similar to those observed for other types of exercise and related interventions. As in the APS/ACP review, we found little evidence to support the use of most passive physical modalities for low back pain. An exception was superficial heat, which was found to be more effective than a nonheated control for acute or subacute low back pain (SOE: moderate). There remains insufficient evidence to determine effects of superficial cold. There also remains insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, interferential therapy, short-wave diathermy, traction and lumbar supports versus sham or no treatment. Although evidence on effectiveness of ultrasound and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was previously classified as insufficient, additional evidence now supports the findings that ultrasound is not effective versus sham ultrasound 497 and that TENS is not effective versus sham TENS,512 though the strength of evidence remains low due to methodological limitations in the trials and imprecision. Based on three trials,550, 552, 553 low-level laser therapy was more effective than sham laser for pain, though methods for assessing pain and duration of followup varied; there was insufficient evidence from one trial to determine effects on function. Evidence to compare effects of one physical modality versus another, or a physical modality versus another active intervention, was generally too limited to reach reliable conclusions. As in the APS/ACP review, we found evidence that psychological therapies (progressive relaxation, electromyography (EMG) biofeedback, operant therapy, combined psychological therapy [e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy]) are associated with lower pain intensity (effects small to moderate) versus wait list control; effects of function were observed for progressive relaxation and combined psychological therapy only (SOE: low). 313 Multidisciplinary rehabilitation (consisting at a minimum of exercise therapy plus psychological therapy, with some coordination) was associated with moderately lower pain intensity versus usual care, with smaller effects on function and no clear effect on return to work (SOE: moderate).348 Psychological therapies and multidisciplinary rehabilitation were primarily evaluated for chronic low back pain, with insufficient evidence to determine effects in patients with acute low back pain or in those with radicular symptoms. Unlike the prior review, a stratified analysis reported in a systematic review found no association between the intensity of multidisciplinary rehabilitation and estimates of effectiveness, 313 though head-to-head comparisons of different intensities of multidisciplinary rehabilitation are not available. In head-to-head comparisons, there were no clear differences between psychological therapies versus exercise therapy, though multidisciplinary rehabilitation was moderately more effective than physical therapy not administered as part of a multidisciplinary program. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.207Our findings regarding the effectiveness of massage, acupuncture, and manipulation were generally consistent with the APS/ACP review in showing some beneficial, primarily short- term effects. These interventions were primarily evaluated for chronic low back pain, with few trials of patients with acute low back pain or specifically with radicular symptoms. Evidence was generally stronger for acupuncture 364, 365 and spinal manipulation437, 438 than for massage,405 which was evaluated in fewer trials, though the strength of evidence varied depending on the specific comparison evaluated (no SOE was rated above moderate). For all of these therapies, the evidence was characterized by marked heterogeneity in the interventions evaluated as well as in the intensity and number of sessions. Although some evidence suggested that massage is more effective versus other interventions considered active, it was not possible to draw strong conclusions due to methodological limitations and imprecision. 405 Although acupuncture was more effective than sham acupuncture for chronic low back pain,365 sham acupuncture techniques varied among trials (superficial needling at acupuncture points, superficial needling at nonacupuncture points, nonpenetrating needles or pressure at acupuncture points) and there was inconsistency, with some trials showing no differences between acupuncture versus sham and effects were primarily observed immediately after treatment, with limited evidence of no effects at longer-term followup. Spinal manipulation was no more effective than sham manipulation for chronic low back pain, but manipulation was as effective as other interventions thought to be effective. 438 Therefore, there remains some uncertainty regarding the specific effects of these interventions, versus nonspecific effects related to needling, mobilization or manipulation, or other aspects of administering these treatments (e.g., attentional or placebo effects). Head-to-head trials that directly compared different massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation techniques generally found no clear differences. Findings regarding the effectiveness of exercise therapies and related interventions were also consistent with the APS/ACP review. Most trials evaluated patients with chronic nonradicular low back pain. For yoga, newer trials strengthen conclusions regarding effectiveness, particularly for yoga versus educational interventions (SOE: moderate). Evidence on motor control exercises, which were not addressed in the APS/ACP review, was generally consistent with evidence for other types of exercise in showing small to moderate effects (SOE: low). Head-to-head trials of exercise programs generally found no clear differences in estimates of effectiveness. Harms were not well-reported in trials of nonpharmacological therapies, though serious adverse events appear rare. For physical modalities, harms when reported were mostly related to superficial effects at the application site. Severe neurological complications were not reported in trials of lumbar spinal manipulation and serious infections, bleeding, or other complications were not reported in trials of acupuncture. Findings in Relationship to What Is Already Known Our findings are generally consistent with prior systematic reviews on noninvasive treatments for low back pain, in part because our report builds upon a prior review and used previously published, high-quality systematic reviews to inform its findings. However, our findings were also generally consistent with other recent systematic reviews that were not used in this report that found NSAIDs and opioids associated with small to moderate effects versus placebo for chronic low back pain, and tricyclic antidepressants associated with small effects that were Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.208not statistically significant.600, 601 Like other reviews, we only found evidence supporting short- term benefits of opioids. Although another review found no differences between opioids versus placebo for low back pain, searches were conducted through 2005 and its findings were based on only four trials, with a pooled estimate that slightly favored opioids (SMD 0.18, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.11). 602 As in other reviews, we found no randomized trials to determine long-term effectiveness of opioids for low back pain. In a recent review that we conducted on opioids for chronic pain in general, we also found no cohort studies to determine the long-term effectiveness of opioids versus no opioid therapy. 603 In that review, we found insufficient evidence from randomized trials to determine the risk of serious harms associated with opioids, due to small samples, inadequate length of followup, poorly standardized methods for assessing harms, and suboptimal harms reporting. In addition, trials typically excluded patients at higher risk for abuse or overdose, though evidence 604, 605 indicates that such patients are more likely to be prescribed opioids in clinical practice than people without risk factors.600, 606 Our finding that acetaminophen is not effective for acute low back pain is based on a recent, well-conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT)43 and differs from our prior review, which concluded that there was good evidence of moderate effects. However, the prior conclusion was based on indirect evidence of acetaminophen for other pain conditions and effects of acetaminophen versus NSAIDs, which showed few differences. Another systematic review, noting the absence of placebo-controlled trials at the time and imprecision and methodological shortcomings in the available studies, rated the same evidence as insufficient. 607 Like our review, a recent systematic review found that acetaminophen was ineffective for low back pain, primarily based on the results of the new trial. 608 Our prior report and other previous systematic reviews137, 138 found tricyclic antidepressants associated with small beneficial effects for low back pain. However, the evidence reviewed for this report suggests that they are not effective versus placebo for pain relief (4 trials; SMD 0.10, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.31; I2=32%) or function. 139 One potential reason for the discrepancy between this finding and prior reviews are that some of the prior reviews did not conduct a meta-analysis. 136, 138 One positive review137 did base findings on a meta-analysis. However, the study in the meta-analysis that reported the largest effect in favor of antidepressants did not report being randomized, 609 it did not include relevant studies that were in the more current review,141, 146, 149 and it did not report methods for data imputation for two trials included in the meta-analysis.140, 148 Our findings regarding the small to moderate effectiveness of the antidepressant duloxetine are consistent with its recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for chronic musculoskeletal pain, including chronic low back pain. 610 Our conclusions were based on trials of duloxetine versus placebo. Although a systematic review found no differences between duloxetine versus other oral medications, its findings were based on a network analysis based on indirect comparisons. 611 For nonpharmacological treatments, our findings are also generally consistent with other systematic reviews. Like other reviews, we found some evidence to support use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies such as acupuncture, spinal manipulation, and massage. 600, 612-616 Although acupuncture was no more effective than sham acupuncture in Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.209some trials, other reviews have also found that the overall evidence (including pooled estimates) suggest beneficial effects on pain.364, 365 As in prior reviews, we found no clear evidence to support one specific type of massage, manipulation, or acupuncture over another.362, 404, 426, 617 Findings regarding the effectiveness of exercise are similar to our prior review and other reviews.618-620 Our findings are also consistent with more specific reviews that focused on specific types of exercise such as aquatic exercise,621 sling exercise,622 walking,623 stability exercises,624 and modifying patterns of movement.625 Additional evidence published since our prior review strengthens conclusions that yoga is effective for low back pain,626, 627 a finding consistent with other recent systematic reviews, and newer evidence supports the effectiveness of motor control exercises. Evidence on tai chi was previously unavailable, but recent randomized trials support its effectiveness. As in our prior review, evidence does not clearly demonstrate that one type of exercise therapy is superior to another. This is consistent with other systematic reviews that have evaluated specific exercise therapy comparisons (e.g., McKenzie versus other exercise methods). 183 Our findings that psychological therapies and multidisciplinary rehabilitation were both effective are consistent with our prior review and other reviews.628 Other reviews that focused on related interventions such as functional restoration or cognitive-behaviorally based physical therapy (in which the literature overlaps with that on multidisciplinary rehabilitation) have also reached positive conclusions. 606, 629, 630 Although there was insufficient evidence to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from psychological therapies and multidisciplinary rehabilitation, a recent randomized trial631 found that a stratified approach in which patients are assessed for risk factors for chronicity, and higher-risk patients receive more intensive cognitive-behavioral based physical therapy, is more effective than usual care without a stratified approach, suggesting that these therapies may be most effective in higher-risk people. Unlike our prior report, which found that higher-intensity multidisciplinary rehabilitation appeared more effective than lower-intensity programs, a stratified analysis based on currently available evidence348 indicated no clear difference in effects. Like our prior review, we found that for most physical modalities, evidence was too weak to determine effectiveness. Although we previously found insufficient evidence to conclude that ultrasound and TENS are not effective, albeit with low strength of evidence. A recent assessment of TENS came to a similar conclusion. 632 As in other reviews, we found that evidence the effectiveness of therapies for radicular low back pain was quite limited.435, 633 Like other reviews, including our prior report, we found that systematic corticosteroids are not effective for radicular low back pain.633, 634 Although duloxetine and other serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and antiseizure medications such as gabapentin and pregabalin are increasingly being prescribed for low back pain, particularly when associated with radicular symptoms, evidence on the effectiveness of nonduloxetine serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors is not available and results of trials of pregabalin and gabapentin have been inconsistent or have not shown clear effects. Although a network meta-analysis has been performed on various treatments for radicular low back pain, the most commonly evaluated treatments were surgical and interventional, findings for noninvasive therapies were primarily based on indirect comparisons, and many estimates were imprecise. 635 Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.210Applicability A number of issues could impact the applicability of our findings. Some studies did not specifically enroll patients with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain, but rather enrolled mixed populations or did not clearly describe the duration of symptoms, which could make it difficult to apply findings if benefits differ according to duration of symptoms. Relatively few studies enrolled patients specifically with radicular symptoms, and many studies did not specifically describe whether patients with radicular symptoms were excluded. Therefore, the degree to which it is possible to extrapolate evidence from studies of patients with primarily nonradicular symptoms to patients with radicular symptoms is uncertain. In addition, studies that focused on radicular pain evaluated clinically diverse populations. Some studies required imaging findings of disc herniation (typically involving younger individuals) or spinal stenosis (typically affecting older individuals), while others did not require imaging confirmation of radicular symptoms. Among studies of patients with nonradicular symptoms, most studies did not attempt to evaluate whether effectiveness varied in subgroups of patients defined by clinical, demographic, imaging, or other characteristics. It is not possible to determine whether effectiveness varies among groups with nonradicular pain based on these factors. For example, most trials of antidepressants excluded patients with depression or only included a small minority of such patients, 139 such that it is unclear whether antidepressants might have additional effects on mood in patients with low back pain and depression. Across interventions, few studies enrolled any or many older adults. Although trials of motor control exercise (MCE) generally selected patients on the basis of tests showing deficits in motor control, specific testing methods and criteria for inclusion varied, and it is unclear whether effects of MCE vary according to findings on motor control tests. 186 For nonpharmacological treatments, the applicability of our findings is affected by the variability among trials in the interventions and comparators evaluated. For example, trials of acupuncture varied in the sites in which needles were applied, the length of acupuncture sessions, the number of sessions, and the time period over which the sessions were performed. 364, 365 In trials that evaluated \"usual care\" comparators, the components of usual care were often not well described or standardized, making it difficult to apply findings to clinical practice. Other factors that could impact the applicability of our findings regarding nonpharmacological interventions includes differences related to the setting in which the intervention was performed (e.g., United States versus another country, specialist versus primary care setting) or due to the training or skill of the person performing the intervention. For acupuncture, for example, some evidence suggests that patient expectations have an important influence on the effectiveness of treatment, 636, 637 such that results from countries in which acupuncture is widely practiced may not be applicable to settings in which it is considered an alternative practice. Another factor that could impact the effectiveness of interventions is the use of cointerventions, which varied across trials and was frequently not reported well. We separately analyzed comparisons that specifically involved the use of one intervention plus another intervention versus the other intervention alone. For example, spinal manipulation plus another intervention was more effective than the other intervention alone, suggesting potential additive effects. To help interpret the results of the trials, we categorized the magnitude of effects for pain and function using the system in the APS/ACP review. Based on these categories, beneficial effects Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.211when present were in the small or moderate range. However, effects that we classified as small (e.g., 5-10 points on a 0 to 100 scale for pain or function) are below some proposed thresholds for minimum clinically important differences (e.g., 15 points on a 0 to 100 V AS for pain, 2 points on a 0 to 10 NRS for pain or function, 5 points on the RDQ, and 10 points on the ODI; or a 30% change from baseline). 28 Nonetheless, our classification system provides some objective bench marks for assessing magnitude of effects, including the smaller effects typically observed in low back pain trials. We also evaluated the proportion of patients who experienced a clinically important improvement in pain or function (e.g., 50% improvement in pain or on the RDQ). However, many studies did not report such dichotomous outcomes, and among those that did, definitions for clinically important improvements varied. A factor that complicates interpretation of findings is that the magnitude of effects might vary depending on the baseline severity, with some evidence suggesting that treatment may be more effective in people with higher baseline symptom severity. 638 Also, the clinical relevance of the same absolute improvement in an outcome measure might differ in individual patients depending on the baseline score (e.g., a 1 point change on a 0- to 10-point NRS for pain might differ for someone with a baseline pain score of 4 versus 9). Most trials enrolled patients with pain symptoms of at least moderate intensity (e.g., >5 on a 0- to 10-point NRS for pain). When present, most beneficial effects were observed at shorter-term (e.g., <3 months) followup, with outcomes often assessed only through the end of the active treatment period, such that it was difficult to determine whether there were sustained benefits. When evidence on longer-term followup was available, effects were typically attenuated or no longer observed. Understanding long-term outcomes is particularly critical for chronic low back pain, given the persistent nature of symptoms. Implications for Clinical and Policy Decisionmaking Our findings have implications for clinical and policy decisionmaking. A number of pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies are supported by some evidence of effectiveness in patients with acute (Tables 31, 32, 33, and 34) or chronic low back pain (Tables 35, 36, 37, and 38). Although clinical practice guidelines recommend acetaminophen as a first-line pharmacological therapy for acute and chronic low back pain, 14, 639 new evidence43 that acetaminophen is ineffective for acute low back pain call into question its appropriateness as a recommended therapy, though findings are based on a single trial and other factors such as low cost, favorable side-effect profile, and effectiveness for other acute pain conditions could also impact decisions regarding its use. 640 Although tricyclic antidepressants have long been recommended as a secondary treatment option for chronic low back pain, duloxetine has specifically been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this condition and appears to be more effective than tricyclic antidepressants as well as associated with a more favorable safety profile, which could impact the selection of drugs within the antidepressant class. The use of opioids for chronic pain has become an area of increasing concern, due to uncertain long-term effectiveness and marked increases in the number of accidental overdoses, as well as other harms related to their abuse potential. 603 Patients with low back pain are frequently prescribed opioids and account for a high proportion of the patients prescribed opioids. Decisions regarding the appropriate use of opioids for low back pain must weigh short-term, relatively Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.212modest benefits against potential harms. Guidelines recommend risk assessment, careful patient selection, and close monitoring and followup in patients prescribed opioids.641 The continued paucity of evidence to determine effective treatments for radicular low back pain (Tables 39, 40, and 41) necessitates that most decisions are based on extrapolation of evidence on the effectiveness of treatments for nonradicular low back pain or other nonback-related neuropathic pain conditions. This could explain why antiseizure medications such as gabapentin and pregabalin are being prescribed more for radicular low back pain, despite the lack of evidence showing that they are effective. Systemic corticosteroids continue to be used for treatment of radicular back pain, despite trials showing that they are ineffective, presumably based upon their known anti-inflammatory properties and use in epidural injections. Our review support clinical practice guidelines that found insufficient evidence to recommend most physical modalities, other than superficial heat. However, these therapies are still commonly used in clinical practice. Among nonpharmacological therapies that were found to be effective, there was insufficient evidence to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from specific therapies. However, a recent trial which found that a stratified approach (in which patients are assessed for risk factors for chronicity, and higher-risk patients receive more intensive cognitive-behavioral based physical therapy) is more effective than usual care without a stratified approach suggests that psychologically-based therapies and multidisciplinary rehabilitation may be most effective in higher-risk people. 631 Other factors that may impact decisions regarding which nonpharmacological therapies to use include cost, availability, and patient preferences. Some evidence suggests that greater patient expectations of benefit from a particular treatment are associated with greater benefits, 636, 637 suggesting that patient preferences should be considered in the selection of therapies. Potential barriers to use of some nonpharmacological therapies include variability in health insurance coverage (e.g., for complementary and alternative medicine therapies) 642 and nonavailability depending on locale or other factors (e.g., multidisciplinary rehabilitation).643 Limitations of the Review Process We included previously published systematic reviews. The reliability of systematic reviews depends on the rigor with which they are conducted.644 Therefore, we focused on higher-quality reviews. For a number of interventions addressed in this report, more than one higher-quality systematic review exists. In addition to quality, we therefore also selected systematic reviews for inclusion based on the closest relevance match based on the Key Questions and scope and how recently searches were conducted. 24 If two or more reviews were similar on these criteria, we prioritized inclusion of updates of reviews that were in the prior APS/ACP review. In some cases, the highest-quality systematic reviews did not provide all of the information necessary to assess findings. We only included such reviews if we could address any methodological limitations through review and assessment of the primary studies. Otherwise, such reviews were excluded. We did not conduct meta-analyses or update meta-analyses included in prior systematic reviews. However, for comparisons without a meta-analysis, we synthesized results qualitatively, using the methods in the AHRQ methods guide. For comparisons for which pooled results were available from prior systematic reviews, we evaluated the consistency of results from new trials against the pooled estimates. Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.213Other limitations of the review process are that we excluded non-English language articles and did not search for studies published only as abstracts. However, some systematic reviews included non-English language articles and abstracts, which did not materially impact conclusions. We were unable to assess for publication bias using graphical or statistical methods to detect small sample effects, methodological limitations in the trials, heterogeneity in the interventions, populations, and outcomes addressed, and small numbers of trials for many comparisons. However, based on searches of reference lists, clinical trials registries, and peer review suggestions, we did not find evidence to suggest that unpublished trials would impact conclusions. There are other noninvasive interventions for low back pain that we did not address, including herbal medicines, 645 educational interventions,646, 647 advice to remain active,646, 648 mattresses, shoe insoles,649 and others.650, 651 We also did not include comparisons of noninvasive therapies versus surgery or interventional procedures, which were outside the scope of this review. We also excluded pain treatment trials that were not restricted to patients with low back pain. The applicability of such trials would depend in part on the proportion of patients with low back pain and what other pain conditions were present. Limitations of the Evidence Base The evidence base had a number of important limitations. As noted previously, evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for radicular low back pain was sparse. Most trials of nonpharmacological treatments focused on patients with chronic low back pain, with insufficient evidence to determine effects for acute low back pain, with the exception of superficial heat. This could be due in part because the natural history or acute low back pain is characterized by rapid improvement, such that nonpharmacological therapies are typically reserved for patients who do not improve in the initial period. A number of interventions were evaluated in small numbers of trials or in trials that primarily had important methodological limitations, precluding strong preclusions. In addition, there were relatively few head-to-head trials of different interventions, making it difficult to compare the effectiveness of one type of therapy versus another, particularly for comparisons of nonpharmacological versus pharmacological therapies. Another limitation of the evidence base is that studies were frequently short term and often only evaluated patients at the end of a course of therapy, making it difficult to determine whether sustained benefits are present. In addition, many trials reported mean changes in outcome measures (typically pain and function), but did not report dichotomized outcomes (e.g., 30% or 50% pain relief or functional improvement). Assessment of outcomes based on continuous as well as dichotomized outcomes would provide a more complete assessment of treatment effects. 652 Some limitations of the evidence were particularly relevant for trials of nonpharmacological interventions. Studies of nonpharmacological interventions were typically characterized by marked heterogeneity in the specific intervention techniques evaluated, as well as in the duration and intensity of treatments, which could attenuate treatment benefits if suboptimal treatment techniques or intensity of therapy was evaluated. In addition, a number of nonpharmacological therapies (e.g., psychological therapies, exercise therapy, massage, and spinal manipulation) are difficult to blind effectively. Therefore, observed benefits could be due in part to placebo, Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.214attentional, or other nonspecific effects, and results are susceptible to performance and other biases, though it is not possible to reliably quantify the extent of such effects. Finally, trials of nonpharmacological therapies did not report harms well; this could be in part because serious harms are not expected with most of these treatments. Research Gaps A number of research gaps limit the full understanding of the effectiveness, comparative effectiveness, and harms of therapies for low back pain.653-656 More research is needed to determine effective treatments for low back pain with radicular symptoms and in understudied populations such as older adults. Trials should be designed to not just evaluate patients immediately after they have completed therapy, but for at least several months after the completion of therapy, in order to help understand whether beneficial effects are sustained. Studies that use more pragmatic designs (e.g., more flexible dosing or use of cointerventions) might help improve patient recruitment and reduce attrition, which is high in long-term trials of low back pain. For nonpharmacological treatments, research to identify optimal treatment techniques and regimens (including intensity and duration of treatments) would be very helpful for defining more standardized interventions to be evaluated in trials. Studies are needed to determine the long-term effectiveness and harms of opioids for chronic low back pain, including higher-risk patients like those commonly encountered in clinical practice. Studies that compare opioids versus nonopioid therapies that address the psychosocial factors often associated with chronic pain (e.g., interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise therapy, or psychological therapies) are needed. Observational studies that are designed to assess serious long-term harms provide some evidence regarding risks of opioids for chronic pain in general, but data specifically in patients with low back pain are lacking. 603 Although observational studies based on administrative databases can be helpful for evaluating risks of opioids, such studies are often limited in their ability to address important potential confounders, and should ideally be supplemented by clinical data, such as in well-designed clinical registries. For systemic corticosteroids, the largest trial to date was recently completed and should help further characterize the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of this treatment. 657 More research is needed to help understand whether nonradicular low back pain can be reliably classified into clinically meaningful subgroups, and which patients or subgroups are most likely to benefit from specific therapies. 658-662 Trials are also needed to confirm whether effects of risk-stratified approaches are reproducible in the United States,663, 664 and to optimize their implementation.665 More research is needed to better understand whether combination therapy with different pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatments is associated with incremental benefits versus individual components of the combination therapy, and which combinations and sequences of therapy are the most effective. Pain relief was the most commonly assessed outcome in trials of treatment for low back pain, followed by back-specific function. Trials should more consistently assess other outcomes related to return to work, quality of life, and health care utilization, in order to provide a more complete picture of treatment effects. Studies that evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for preventing future episodes of low back pain would also be very helpful, as low back pain can be a recurrent, episodic condition and these patients are likely to account for a high proportion Archived: This report is greater than 3 years old. Findings may be used for research purposes, but should not be considered current.215of resources. In addition, trials should evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for preventing the transition from acute to chronic low back pain. In order to provide balanced assessments of low back pain interventions, trials should more consistently and rigorously evaluate and report harms. Trials should routinely collect information on known or common harms associated with a particular intervention, and use more open-ended methods to identify unexpected or uncommon harms.

Combination therapy was also associated with better function at 1 month, (2 trials; SMD, 0.40; 95% CI, to 0.09; I2 = 0%). One trial not included in the systematic review reported results consistent with these findings. Spinal manipulation plus home exercise and advice, radicular LBPLow One good-quality trial found spinal manipulation plus home exercise and advice to be associated with greater improvement in leg and back pain at 12 weeks vs. home exercise and advice alone (mean differences about 1 point on a 0 to 10 scale), but effects were smaller (0.3 to 0.7 points) and no longer statistically significant at 52 weeks. Spinal manipulation: Adverse eventsLow Harms were not reported well in most trials of spinal manipulation. No serious adverse events were reported, and most adverse events were related to muscle soreness or transient increases in pain. Key Question 2. Nonpharmacological noninvasive therapiesUltrasound Ultrasound vs. sham ultrasound, chronic LBP: Pain and functionLow for pain, insufficient for functionA systematic review found no difference between ultrasound vs. sham ultrasound in pain at the end of treatment (3 trials; mean difference, 7.12 on 0 to 100 scale; 95% CI, 18.0 to 3.75; I2 = 77%), and 2 trials found no effects on pain 4 weeks after the end of treatment. Evidence from 5 trials was too inconsistent to determine effects on function, although a larger good-quality trial found no effect on the RDQ. Ultrasound vs. no ultrasound, chronic LBP: Pain and functionLow A systematic review found no differences between ultrasound vs. no ultrasound in pain (2 trials; mean difference, 2.16; 95% CI, 4.66 mean difference, 0.41; 95% CI, 3.14 to 2.32), but estimates were imprecise.

LLLT vs. sham laser, chronic LBP: Pain and functionLow Three of 4 trials found LLLT to be more effective than sham laser for pain, although methods for assessing pain and duration of followup varied; 2 trials found LLLT to be more effective than sham laser for function, with small magnitude of effect. LLLT plus NSAID vs. sham plus NSAID, acute or subacute LBP: Pain and functionLow One trial found LLLT plus an NSAID to be associated with lower pain intensity vs. sham laser plus an NSAID or the NSAID alone (mean differences, 9 to 14 points on a 0 to 100 VAS); effects on the ODI also favored combination treatment but were smaller (differences <6 points). LLLT plus another intervention vs. the other intervention alone, chronic LBP: Pain and functionInsufficient There was insufficient evidence from 3 trials to determine effects of LLLT plus exercise vs. sham laser plus exercise alone due to methodological shortcomings and inconsistency.

Effects on function were generally smaller than effects on pain. More research is needed to understand optimal selection of treatments, effective combinations and sequencing of treatments, and effectiveness of treatments for radicular low back pain.
