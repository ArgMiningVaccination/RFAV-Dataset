Summary Bibliography Invitation Pentecost 2021 Dear Readers, In reading this book I invite you to engage in unconventional thoughts willingly and openly - to wrestle with perhaps previously unknown concepts. Persisting in old concepts cannot give the matter a new, necessary angle of vision. This book is also meant to inspire your own observations. Whoever does not have the possibility to do this directly, can nevertheless grasp and penetrate the described experiences with their own thinking, examine for credibility, and follow their own sense of truth. The best way to understand what is meant here is to read the first part of the book from beginning to end. The chapters of the second and third part are readable in independent order. Perhaps you wonder what is the mountain for? (Picture of a mountain shown). The subject is challenging, it needs spiritual support. It is the Jungfrau (Virgin) massif in Switzerland. Its name speaks for itself. The mountain is intimately connected with the power of our earth, with the Marian- or Maternal power. With this, our journey can begin. Have a stimulating read! Thomas Mayer Preface By C. Pfeiffer, M.D., Molecular Biologist, Doctor The Corona crisis in a unique way has presented us with a clinical picture, as well as with a societal situation of an unprecedented scale. What is astonishing is that in this global pandemic there is an apparent discrepancy between the real traceable numbers of infections or deaths and the public narrative. Completely new \"vaccines\" for the Corona virus have been developed and four have been approved in a very short time: Moderna, BioNTech/Pfizer, Johnson&Johnson and AstraZeneca. What these vaccines have in common is that they are not \"classical\" vaccines, but gene transfer technologies, such as those used in gene therapy studies. In a unique way, all safety criteria, testing criteria and study criteria, which are otherwise strict in vaccine research, have been greatly softened. These novel gene transfer technologies have been approved almost worldwide in a fast-track and emergency approval process, even though very effective treatments for Covid-19 are available but have been officially suppressed. Due to these circumstances, we must deal intensively with these \"vaccines\", which are used in this form on billions of people for the first time. As a scientifically and clinically active molecular biologist, I would like to draw attention to essential active principles, their complexity, and possible dangers, especially since no sufficient toxicological, genotoxicological, mutagenotoxicological or long-term toxicological data are available on these experimental vaccines. 1. This form of vaccine technology makes use of gene transfer technologies. In the case of mRNA vaccines, a sophisticated system of nano-lipid structures has also been developed. These serve to protect the mRNA from the body's own enzymes, which want to render this mRNA harmless, as well as to distribute and introduce the RNA into the target cells in a completely coherent manner. The lipid nanoparticles are novel in this form in humans and have not yet been adequately tested in broad, publicly available clinical trials. 2. In a pivotal Pfizer study, the distribution behavior of lipid nanoparticles loaded with mRNA was investigated. This was required by the Japanese government prior to approval. The study clearly shows that the lipid nanoparticles are distributed throughout the entire organism, i.e., in all organs and structures including the central nervous system. Moreover, they can accumulate in various organs, especially in the female ovaries, spleen, liver, and bone marrow. 3. Synthetically produced mRNA is a highly sophisticated construct that uses non-naturally occurring neucleotides and nucleotide sequence chains. These allow an enormous stabilization of the mRNA as well as an effective reading of the same (so called Translation). This technology makes possible to produce a high number of spike proteins in the cells and to discharge them in high numbers into the blood and lymph stream, flooding the body with spike proteins. 4. It is known from several studies that these spike proteins have toxic effects on the vascular endothelia (the cells of the innermost wall layer of lymph and blood vessels) and can thus be responsible for - under certain circumstances dangerous to fatal - blood clotting disorders and inflammatory reactions in organs. 5. Due to the increased stability of the synthetic mRNA, ensured by sophisticated design parameters, it is possible to use cellular enzyme chains (reverse transcriptases). These can reverse transcribe the information contained in the synthetic mRNA into the body's own DNA and then integrate this DNA into the cell's own genome. This mechanism is known from HIV studies, as well as from studies on cellular DNA repair. For this purpose, single-stranded RNA (or mRNA) is used to repair DNA damage. Thus, an incorporation of the information of the synthetic mRNA into the cell's own genome is possible in principle. Due to the accumulation of mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles, for example in the bone marrow or ovaries, an integration of mRNA information into the genome of hematopoietic stem cells is also possible. Through this, leukemia can be triggered. It can also be integrated into the germ line, which is passed on to the next generation. We are talking about a gene therapy technology that not only has the potential to target and manipulate the intrinsic immune response, but also to permanently anchor the information of the synthetic mRNA in the genome. This involves enormous risks and dangers, as gene therapy studies in humans have shown. It has been shown that manipulations of the highly dynamic human genome have led to serious sequential disturbances, which unfortunately only became apparent after several years in the appearance of malignant tumors. It is highly irresponsible to distribute these vaccines without long-term genotoxicological and carcinotoxicological studies on the basis of the current data - especially to adolescents, children and pregnant women. In addition, recent data from Israel, the UK, Iceland, and India show that in the above-mentioned cases we have to do with the so-called \"leaky vaccines\". This means that the vaccinated persons become less ill but can still be infected and pass on the virus. As a result, more dangerous and possibly even deadly viral mutations prevail, similar to Marek's disease in poultry. In addition, ADE (Antigen Dependent Enhancement) cannot be ruled out with these vaccines, which can lead to a significant worsening of symptoms when the virus is re-infected. An intensive study of these \"vaccines\" is urgently needed. This is done in this book in an extended way. As a molecular biologist, I am glad to be able to deal with the spiritual dimensions of vaccines. I would like to add that I feel very connected to anthroposophical medicine with its understanding of the human being and integrative medicine. I wish this book, which has a character of a workshop, a wide distribution. Part 1. Perceptions Basic Ideas This book deals with the question of how corona inoculations can affect the supersensible members of the human being and the afterlife. These questions will be examined on the basis of empirical supersensory perceptions. In order to get as broad a basis as possible, I contacted more than 50 people with extrasensory perception and collected reports. These are very subtle perceptions that can easily be overlooked. In the everyday life they often make themselves little noticeable. But the described phenomena have been found again and again in the concentrated supersensory research. With the expression \"fine\" nothing is said to the content of the perceptions, but rather to the subtle kind of the perception process. Through this increase of the perceptive faculty one can meet \"beautiful\" or \"ugly\" beings and spiritual events, which will be described with specific expressions. It is not easy to find words for the supersensible perceptions simply because there are no words that could describe them. This is often only possible by means of reference to the physical world. For example, when we speak of \"holes in the aura\", we are not referring to holes that are visible to the senses, but to areas of the soul that are not penetrated by the I, and into which foreign feelings and beings can enter and persist. Also, the \"hole\" can be the region through which the spiritual and etheric-life force is lost. This book contains different information than other publications on the subject. I write about the spiritual field in which I specialize. Other research I draw only selectively to illuminate results. I try to describe the problem as clearly as possible using excerpts from the examination protocols and many testimonials. I also searched for already published statements of other authors. Important questions will be discussed, and backgrounds are explored as much as possible. It transpires that the four main Corona vaccines in the Western countries, taken as a whole, are a strong attack on the physical body and the energy body. Through this attack, these bodies can become unreachable (blocked) for the higher members of the supersensible human being. Likewise, the angel and the body-elemental-being can be pushed aside. As a result, in the afterlife, this can lead to the condition of being chained to Earth and a very long suffering for the deceased. Of course, the effect varies from person to person. There are people who can cope with the side effects of these vaccines and even transform them to a great extent. I say this already here, to make clear from the beginning that certain fundamental questions remain open: - In how many people do such effects occur? This, among others, seems to depend on the soul-spiritual \"defense mechanism\" a person can deploy against the vaccination. - To what extent are the soul-spiritual consequences of vaccination naturally processed (neutralized) in the course of time? - How strong are the consequences for the future incarnations? - With which therapeutic means can a processing (neutralization) be supported? It is important for me to emphasize that this is not about ideology, but about empirical perception and truth-seeking. Science and spiritual research are always an open process of the search for truth. It must not be driven by personal preferences. For confidentiality reasons, all names have been changed in the descriptions of specific cases. This is normal. However, it is not normal that all authors are also named only with pseudonyms. I know them personally, and they do not want to be the target of a defamation campaign. Many of them have normal professions and do not want to lose their jobs. Unfortunately, such fears are justified today, we know many cases of sanctions and dismissals due to non-conformist views. Standards of democratic culture, freedom of thought and freedom of expression, which just yesterday were considered to be solid, can no longer be built upon today. Large sections of politics and the media are waging a religious war against dissenting views. The social mood has been poisoned by the proponents of lockdowns and vaccinations. Anthroposophy, naturopathy, and alternative medicine are targets of choice in this regard. Unfortunately, some professional associations and employers cave to this pressure instead of standing up for a free spiritual life. The agitators also hit many respected natural scientists who dare to publish \"inappropriate\" research results. This societal change into totalitarianism is devastating for a free democracy. It was also reflected in a survey by the Allensbach Institute for Public Opinion Research (1): \"In June 2021, just 45 percent said that people were free to express their opinions. (...) From the 1970s until the last decade, more than two-thirds of those surveyed regularly held this view, but since then the answers have changed dramatically\". Such an erosion of democracy should cause an outcry in politics, the media, parties, and associations - yet this is not happening. The canalization of the social discussion is obviously wanted. I had to accept this bitter reality. Only anonymization of the authors creates the necessary protection that enabled the publication of this book. What forces are at work here spiritually behind the scenes, will become transparent in the course of this book. One difficulty in writing this book was finding the right tone. The subject is emotionally poisoned and saturated. Our findings are surprising to many. However, the aim is not to stimulate negative emotions, but to present research results in a sober and comprehensible way and to point out ways out of the impasse. But ways out can only be found through understanding. That is why there is no way around taking a detailed look at vaccines and their effects, even if the results are unpleasant. It is not about a \"harmless jab\", but about a powerful impulse to initiate a change in the human body, so that it is damaged in its basic evolutionary function as the vehicle for the soul-spiritual being of Man. This impulse can also block human being's existence after death. In this respect it really is about the fundamental question of the future of mankind: Do we want to become a kind of \"human-machine\" or do we want to remain soul-spiritual beings? I realize that this book will be challenging for some readers and there is a risk that they will get into a doomsday mood. My effort has therefore been to infuse every written line with the attitude of sober loving serenity. The situation is not hopeless. I experience again and again that lofty spiritual beings look at the Corona crisis and vaccinations with calmness and confidence. It is a trial from which in the long run much good can come, even if today it is overwhelming for most people. We can yet grow from the corona inoculations, only we must approach this spiritual confrontation with sufficient activity. This is equally true for the unvaccinated as well as for the vaccinated. As a help for finding the inner balance in this time, my booklet \"Spiritual Self-Defense in the Corona Crisis - 28 meditations\" can be of help. Many aspects of the individual handling of the corona crisis are described there and a spiritual-scientific classification is given. I recommend it as a supplement to this reading. Sense Perceptible Let us first look at the physical plane before we come to the supersensory planes. How does the Covid 19 disease work? And what are the medical side effects of the Corona vaccinations? How dangerous in Covid-19? The German Federal Ministry of Health writes about this question on an information poster from summer 2020: \"The infection is mild in most cases and is not life-threatening for most people. The virus can cause flu-like symptoms such as coughing, fatigue and fever. In severe cases, respiratory problems or pneumonia may occur. Most people who get sick are helped by rest, drinking plenty of fluids and, if needed, fever-reducing medication.\" (2) These sober statements stand in striking contrast to the emotional charge of the subject. It is not easy to talk or write about Covid. For many, whether \"Covid 19 awareness/responsibility\" is taken seriously enough has become an important criterion when they are asked to engage in a text or conversation. An only half-suspected negligence already acts as a trigger, that causes further distancing. It is true, there are very severe cases of Covid 19. From a supersensory point of view, the disease also appears problematic. This will be described in detail in this book. But let us first stay on the external level and look at the central statistical figures. There are well-established mortality data for Covid19 worldwide. On average, 0.15% of all infected people die, i.e., about 150 out of 100,000. (3) This is equivalent to the mortality of flu (influenza), which is between 0.1 and 0.2%. Conversely, this means that 99.85% of those infected survive the disease and are immune afterwards. The mortality risk for the population up to 65 years of age, even in infection hotspots, is in the range of the mortality risk of a daily car trip to work (4). Vulnerable groups are people of advanced age or with underlying conditions. Here, the numbers of serious illnesses and deaths is increasing significantly. However, even for these people, the Corona virus is no more dangerous than other disease possibilities. The average age of Covid19 deaths in all countries is over 80 years, which is within normal life expectancy. Nearly half of the people were protected from Covid19 from the beginning by \"cross-immunity\" due to previous infections with one of the common cold causing corona viruses or other viruses. Ten studies from around the world have examined cross-immunity in the general population. The mean of the results is 46%, already at the beginning of the pandemic. (5) Why Vaccinate? In view of this disease profile, the question arises, why should one be vaccinated at all? For most people, there is little to be said for it in terms of risk assessment. Therefore, under normal circumstances, the will to vaccinate would probably only be comparable to that of previous flu seasons vaccinations. Therefore, under normal circumstances, the will to vaccinate would probably only be comparable to that of previous flu vaccinations. Nevertheless, in order to push through with a mass vaccination, governments around the world built up a strong vaccination pressure since spring 2020. This was only possible by systematically disregarding the alternatives to vaccination, such as strengthening the immune system, prophylaxis in risk groups and early treatment of the disease. Even in the quoted poster of the German Ministry of Health, there is no mention of a targeted aerial treatment option. In fact, one can support the course of the disease very well with natural, homeopathic and anthroposophical medicines, as Frank Meyer M.D. and Johannes Wilkens M.D. describe in their book \"Corona Treated Naturally\". Also, well known classic medicines show great effects. An American group of scientists evaluates very clearly the studies on drugs for Covid19 treatment. At https://c19early.com there are 856 studies on 24 drugs - at the time of writing this book. These studies show remarkable improvements in disease control, for example: Proxalutamide by 86%, Povidone-Iodine by 71%, by 42%, Aspirin by 37%, Hydroxychloroquine by 27%, finally, Vitamin C brings an improvement of 17%. According to the studies, much can be achieved with vitamins and zinc alone, even in prophylaxis. Yes - there are surprisingly many effective and very inexpensive drugs to Covid 19. However, these were not promoted or approved by governments; since April 2020, they have only pushed and funded Corona vaccines. In the population, the impression was created that there were no other medicines and in this hopeless situation only the vaccination would help. The lockdowns, the overwriting of the basic rights by the emergency ordinances, and mask requirements were additional important means to keep the pandemic in the spotlight and to create vaccination pressure: To end the agony of the lockdowns, people should get vaccinated. PCR tests were assigned a key role to justify this. \"Positive tests\" were called \"infections\", although it is at best a \"contamination\", but not an illness. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that the PCR test is far too sensitive to detect disease. (6) Viruses are everywhere, for example, remnants of Epstein-Barr virus are found in 95% of all people, but very few contract mononucleosis. (7) Even months after surviving a Covid19 infection, an immune and healthy person can test positive. Also, the technical error rate of the tests has never been accurately determined and accounted for, while any other measurement method must by law be calibrated. Thus, mass testing does not produce meaningful numbers, but it has succeeded in being used in the media as a justification for lockdowns. And with the ever-increasing testing requirements, politicians have had an impact on the numbers; when more testing is done, more is found. On the other hand, systematic data collection was obviously not politically desirable. This is indicated by the fact that this data collection was already demanded by scientists in the spring of 2020 but rejected by politicians. (8) In order to capture the reality of the course of infection, a fixed representative group of several tens of thousands of people would have to be continuously examined for infections and immune reactions (antibodies and T cells). At the same time as the lockdowns, there was a vaccination drumbeat in the media, as well as carrots and sticks. Consulting sociologists at Berlin's Humboldt University researched the methods that could be used to persuade vaccine doubters to get the Corona vaccine: Through low-threshold enticements such as small monetary gifts, as well as through harsh repression against the unwilling and the deprivation of basic human rights. (9) The categorization of fundamental rights into first and second class (vaccination apartheid) clearly violates the Constitution, but our government was not interested in that, they enforced it politically. As a result, many people had themselves vaccinated because they wanted to \"travel again\", \"go to concerts\" or \"not lose their jobs\". Do the vaccinations help at all? A fundamental problem is that vaccinations do not really protect against a constantly mutating virus. It has been suggested that the virus can be eradicated by widespread vaccination, although this has no scientific basis. In the case of the flu virus, new vaccinations are given every year, with controversial benefits. Data from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Singapore show that vaccinated persons infected with the delta variant of the Corona virus can carry as much viral material in their nose as unvaccinated persons. They are similarly contagious as unvaccinated people. (10) A study in Massachusetts in July 2021 showed that unvaccinated people were even less likely to contract Covid19 as vaccinated people. (11) In August 2021, in the vaccine champion-state, Israel, the infection numbers were already rising again to the point where there was talk of a \"fourth wave\"; there was no difference in infections between vaccinated and revaccinated people. (12) Iceland also had one of the highest vaccination rates, with 78%. (13) Nevertheless, there was a wave of infections in the summer of 2021. Iceland's chief epidemiologist said in a radio interview: \"It was disappointing that herd immunity had not been achieved with vaccination\". He went on to say that there was only one other way to achieve herd immunity, and that was to allow the virus to spread throughout the community. (14) Vaccine health risks Gene-based vaccines from BioNTech, Modern, AstraZeneca and Johnson&Johnson used in Western countries received emergency approval with an abbreviated testing procedure. These gene-based vaccines use new, untested methods. Typically, it can take 15 to 20 years for a vaccine to be approved and brought to market. (15) The mRNA vaccines represent a new technology for which there is little real-world experience, and for which there are no drug or vaccine approvals. Naturally, there have been no studies on long-term effects and late effects. These long-term studies are now being made by using billions of people all over the world in a global human experiment, as becomes clear by simple reflection. There are many discussions about the danger of the vaccines. These vaccines are based on inducing the body's own cells to produce spike proteins. However, these spike proteins are problematic. \"We made a big mistake and didn't realize it until now\", confessed Canadian vaccine researcher Byram Bridle (16), \"for example, we didn't know that the spike protein itself is a toxin and is a pathogenic protein\". Bridle was antagonized for this statement but received prominent support from Robert Malone (17), the inventor of mRNA vaccination (18). Robert Malone surely knows what he is talking about. The list of possible side effects is long, often including blood disorders (thrombosis, heart attacks, etc), nerve disorders, and autoimmune disorders. It is also possible that the immune system is disturbed, so that the disease against which the vaccine was given later becomes even stronger, called Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). A group of researchers from Harvard University in Cambridge wrote an extensive article in June 2021, in which they addressed the possible and already occurred side effects of mRNA vaccines: \"Worse than the disease? Examining some possible unintended consequences of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19\". (19) The purpose of this reference is to make clear that the many medical problems are well known. Noteworthy is the \"European problem\" - that these vaccines fell under the EU directives on the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). It is therefore a matter of genetic engineering in the usual linguistic usage. For this reason, the EU Parliament decided on July 10, 2020, to adopt a separate exemption regulation. (20) An important question is: Why did the Western governments approve only these four experimental vaccines and why not the vaccines with traditional technology, which are also developed and used in some regions of the world? Cases of Death after vaccinations There are government registries for vaccination adverse reactions in each country. One problem is data collection. Obviously, a lot of vaccine injuries are not reported. Prof. Harald Walach found very high differences in adverse event reporting among EU countries (21) : While Holland reported 701 adverse events per 100,000 vaccinations, Germany reported only 38. The EU average is 127 cases per 100,000 vaccinations. Prof. Walach comments: \"Is vaccination chauvinistic? We don't think so. It is unlikely that people from different EU countries react differently to the same vaccines. Rather, the reporting discipline and procedures are likely to differ\". Let's put this in perspective before we take a closer look at some figures from the registries. VAERS (22) is the U.S. government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions. VAERS has been collecting data on all vaccinations since 1990, 90 percent of which are from the United States. As of Aug. 6, 2021, VAERS has received 571,830 reports of adverse reactions to Corona vaccinations, including 70,666 emergency visits, 51,242 hospitalizations, and 12,791 deaths. (23) These are staggering numbers. Because VAERS has been collecting data since 1990, it is possible to make a comparison with other vaccinations. The graph overleaf shows the reported deaths of all vaccination types. (24) The red line, starting on the left in 1990, is steadily bottoming out, then rapidly closing into the heaves in 2021 due to deaths following Corona vaccination. In the U.S., vaccination against many diseases has been widely used for decades and reported suspected cases of vaccine deaths remain manageable. Then Corona vaccination begins, and there are over 12,000 suspected cases within a few months. I rub my eyes in amazement, where is the public outcry? The reality seems to be worse. On July 19, 2021,the American Frontline Doctors (AFLDS) (25), in a lawsuit against the Corona vaccinations published the affidavit of a whistleblower, a computer programmer. This individual has expertise in healthcare data analysis and in the past has developed more than 100 different algorithms that have uncovered healthcare fraud. She is certain that the number of deaths after vaccinations is significantly higher. She compared VAERS data with Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) data on vaccines and deaths and found out the following: \"Deaths occurring within three days of vaccination at CMS are at least a factor of five higher than the data reported in VAERS. This suggests that the true number of vaccine-related deaths is at least 45,000\" (26) She also referred to the 2009 swine flu, when the vaccine was withdrawn from the market after only 53 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) operates the Vigo-Access database to record adverse drug reactions worldwide. Reports from more than 100 countries are recorded - which countries report and to what extent, is unknown. As of Aug. 18, 2021, 1,759,556 Covid19 vaccine side effects and 11,263 deaths have been reported. (27) EudraVigilance is a similar Database in the European Union. It reported 13,055 deaths following Covid19 vaccination as of August 15, 2021. (28) The same picture in Germany: the government's Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) reported 1,254 deaths after vaccination and 131,671 suspected cases of vaccine side effects as of July 31, 2021, - 14,027 of these were serious and required hospitalization or were classified as medically \"significant\". (29) So much for the official numbers. The number of unrecorded cases is likely to be many times higher. There are constantly new studies on the medical side effects of vaccination. To make the topic even more concrete, here are two examples: - Heart muscle inflammation in adolescents: The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The CDC notes that the risk of developing heart muscle inflammation could be 200 times the average after the second dose in people younger than 25. \"Members of a CDC advisory committee confirmed a total of 1,200 cases of myocarditis in 16- to 24-year-olds and stated that mRNA-COVID vaccines should carry a warning label\". (30) - Miscarriages: \"A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that Covid vaccines caused spontaneous abortions in 104 of 127 pregnant women during the first trimester. A total of 827 pregnant women participated in the study, but 700 of them did not receive the experimental vaccine until the third trimester of pregnancy. This means that the vaccine disrupted critical stages of early prenatal development and killed four out of five babies during pregnancy\". (31) Why are these injections not stopped? In view of the figures listed, this question is compelling. If a virus kills, then it kills as a virus. But a human being kills as a human being - and we must never do so. If we know that an injection can be potentially lethal, we must not apply it. This is rooted in our Christian-occidental view of the human being and our system of values. As a reminder: We are not talking about risky operations or medication of seriously ill people, but about vaccinating healthy people. But there is no public outcry and no immediate ban of these injections by the authorities. Why isn't the number of daily vaccination deaths announced on the hourly news the same way it was with Covid19 deaths? All this is part of similar processes in which economic interests prevail at the expense of people and nature. One example: In July 2021, four American pharmaceutical companies agreed to the \"opiate settlement\". A payment of $26 billion is expected to end some 4,000 lawsuits. (32) The pharmaceutical companies were accused of downplaying the risks associated with powerful painkillers for profit and aggressively marketing the drugs in full awareness of their addictive potential. Addiction caused by opioids has claimed more than half a million lives in the United States. A nexus of pharmaceutical companies and government agencies was responsible. Johnson&Johnson, a producer of Corona vaccines, was also involved. So much for the consideration on the physical level, let us now turn to the supersensible levels. Supersensible Research Supersensory experience has existed since the beginning of mankind. That the world is experienced only sensually-physically is an exception. The cultural history is full of testimonies of the experience of forces and beings. However, the connection to the spiritual must be won a new repeatedly. How can the spiritual world be grasped with the modern powers of consciousness and thinking? This was a question of the philosophers and writers of German Idealism: Joahann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Schlegel, Novalis, Friedrich Schiller and Johan Wolfgang von Goethe. In continuation of this spiritual inquiry, the Goethean researcher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) became a pioneer of modern supersensible investigation. His 354 books with writings and lectures contain infinite depths. He attempted to create a broad foundation for the science of the spiritual world on which humanity can to further build. The term \"anthroposophy\" was coined by Rudolf Steiner with a similar meaning as \"natural science\" or \"social science\". It is about the fully conscious perception and exploration of the supersensible world in all its ramifications and beings. The natural science is divided into physics, chemistry, geology, biology etc. -Anthroposophy is subdivided into science of ethers, angelic science, science of elemental beings, science of the dead, karmic science, etc. Just as natural science is based on a theory of knowledge and scientific methodology, in anthroposophy the training in meditative way and the methodology of supersensible perception is elaborated in many ways. A special feature of Rudolf Steiner's work is his ability describes the spiritual world in a comprehensive breadth and accuracy in the degree rarely found elsewhere. Accordingly, he coined many new exact spiritual-scientific terms. Steiner describes the processes and beings of the spiritual world in thought-forms, so that someone else can understand it, even if that person cannot experience it themselves. Rudolf Steiner's impulse was thus to build a bridge between the exploration of the earthly and the spiritual worlds, so that they could mutually impregnate each other. He strove for supersensible research that would satisfy scientific demands, and for this he used the soul forces of clarity of thought and sensory awareness. Through them he brought the spiritual experience down into the earth consciousness and crafted it in thoughts and words. The natural science dismisses human feelings and sensations as \"subjective\" and useless for \"objective\" cognition. Thus, it excludes an essential part of man and the world. Anthroposophy as spiritual science shows a way how the human being can transform his own \"ego-bound\" feelings into \"world-bound\" feelings and thereby become perceptive for the soul-spiritual world. The essential methods of perception of extrasensory research - Imagination, Inspiration, and Intuition - were described in detail by Rudolf Steiner, for example in the book The Stages of Higher Knowledge. (33) The clairvoyant spiritual perception takes place in four specific stages, which I would like to characterize briefly: - Increase of concentration, elevation of consciousness, gradual encounter with one's own unrefined, earth-bound parts of the soul, and through this attention and acceptance of the \"lower I\" - connecting with the \"higher Self\". - Imaginative cognition: I receive or create images, ideas, thoughts, or gestures independent of the sensory world and I pay attention to whether these are filled with forces or beings and begin a life of their own. An Imagination is always imbued with Inspiration and Intuition. Thereby the meaning content reveals itself at the same time. - Inspiration: I take away the created Imaginations and keep only in the inward feelings, impulses and activities that were supporting it. Through this inward jolt, a \"conversation\" with the entities can begin. It is a personal conversation, a \"you-relationship\". - Intuitive knowledge: I also extinguish this inner activity but keep myself awake. I enter within a respective other spiritual being and experience its life, organization, and connection with spiritual world. I do not exist anymore for this moment, but only the contacted being that I am exists. The intuitive cognition is always an I-relation. To those who hear about these four stages for the first time, it may seem strange and unattainable. That changes when one has become accustomed to it. According to my perception, all who perceive supersensibly in awake consciousness work with these four stages. It takes years of practice, meditation, work with one's own inner shadows, and study of anthroposophy and other sciences of the soul and spiritual world. It is important that the research rests on a broad background of experience. Another very important component is teamwork, joint investigation, exchange, and debate to validate methods and results. Some basic concepts of the Spiritual Science In the reports in this book, terms are used which I must explain to make it understandable. These terms may not be in common usage, but they are a basic terminology of the science of Spirit. Of course, these short explanations cannot do justice to the fullness and complexity hidden behind these terms, but it will give an overview. Levels of the spiritual world: For orientation it is useful to distinguish between the following three levels: - Etheric world (life- and formative forces) - Astral world (soul world) - Spiritual world (creative sources for everything created) Typically, \"spiritual world\" is used as a generic term for all three levels. These levels are in turn subdivided in many further areas. And they are inhabited by entities. Angelic hierarchies: These are inhabitants of the spiritual world. They can be thought of as great, exalted consciousness spaces. In practical work, it is helpful to divide the angelic world into nine hierarchies, according to the Christian terminology given by Dionysius Areopagite. The angelic world is aligned with the Trinity standing above it: Father-Son-Holy Spirit. Elemental beings: They are inhabitants of the etheric and astral worlds. They implement locally the impulses of the higher angelic hierarchies. Everything is infused (ensouled) by them, also the body. Members of the Human Being (Bodies) Besides the world of senses, the human being lives also in all areas of the supersensible world, and consists of many higher members (bodies), which together form the human aura in its complexity. In former times, these members - often under different names - were part of a cognitive inquiry and spiritual traditions. Today the best-known entity among these members is the material body. Material Body: We perceive it with our senses, see and touch it, since it consists of matter. Today, many people identify very strongly with the material body, and it is this body that is the subject of inquiries of the medical sciences. In reality, however, this material body is only a very small part of the whole human being. If someone looks only at the cut fingernails of a person, then we would say that with such a narrow point of view we cannot understand this person at all. It is the same when we look only at the material body. The material body is permeated by other members of the human being, but they usually remain undifferentiated. For example, we experience the material body as alive, but this life is already a perception of the etheric-life body. Physical Body, also called Phantom Body or Form body: It is the spiritual, working archetype, the construction plan of the material body. It is created before an incarnation out of the cosmic Spirit Man (see further below) and holds the form of the material body. Since the term \"physical body\" is easily associated with \"material body\", in the following I will mainly use the word \"phantom body\" when describing this member of the human being. It can be perceived supersensibly some inches around the material body, however usually this ability must be practiced for a long time. It is easier to observe the etheric body. Etheric body, also called Life Body or Body of Formative Forces: The etheric body elevates dead matter into life and creates a whole living organism from many individual elements (e.g., the organs or cells). The etheric body forms the basis of all life. The term Ether is comparable to Prana in India, Qi in ancient China and Ki in Japan. All living beings, besides humans also animals and plants, have their own etheric body. If one meditatively pursues the question, what is the difference between minerals and plants, one can get an understanding and experience of the etheric body. The etheric body forms the organs of the body according to the archetype of the phantom body. It is the vehicle of memories, temperaments, and habits. Thoughts usually become conscious to us when they receive a form in the etheric body; representations usually become visible in the etheric body in front of the head. The etheric body always mixes with the environment, and thus several etheric bodies can be permanently united. A family or a community of life usually forms a common etheric body. The etheric body is the densest part of the human aura. Astral Body: The astral body is the body that constitutes our experiences and our emotions. It could also be called the \"Body of Experience\". If we meditatively pursue the question of what the difference between plants and animals is, we can come into an understanding and experience of the astral body. It is the basic vehicle of the consciousness, but not of the self-consciousness, which arises only through the \"I\". Feelings like desire and dislike, sympathy and antipathy are experienced through the astral body. It enables the independent movement of the body and all sensual perceptions. Likewise, all thought content and the conscious part of our will-intentions are experienced in the astral body. Still, the different members of the human being are not separated but connected. When experiences of the astral body are imprinted into the etheric body, the Sentient body is formed. The \"I\": Rudolf Steiner describes it very beautifully as the \"Veiled Sanctuary of the Soul\". The \"I\" belongs to the eternal spiritual core of man and is at the same time individual and universal. In its depth, the \"I\" is not easy to understand. The \"I\" penetrates the other members of the being and reshapes them, therefore it can also be called the \"I-organization\". The \"I\" is the captain on the ship of the other members. Through the work of the \"I\" in the astral body, the Sentient Soul and the Intellectual- and Mind soul come into being. Sentient Soul: The Sentient Soul is part of the human soul and not only mediates all perceptions and sense impressions, but is also the seat of all drives, desires, passions, and impulses with which the \"I\" have connected itself. In the Sentient Soul, however, the \"I\" broods only dully; the self-consciousness of the \"I\" is not yet awakened. Instead, the \"I\" identify itself with feelings, thoughts, and perceptual contents, whereby ego-entanglements can arise. The ego is the lower \"I\" hardened in egoism, which appears as a distorted echo of the authentic \"I\". Intellectual- and Mind Soul: lives in the interplay of intellect and mind. The mere intellect makes the soul life sober, cold, and lacking interest. The Intellectual Soul is filled with what it thinks or perceives and gets lost in it. The term \"mental body\" is largely adequate to the Intellectual Soul. On the other hand, the Mind gives warmth and direction to the soul. In the Mind, emotions and will-impulses are connected in a healthy unity in such a way that they do not rob the \"I\" of the dominion over the soul - unlike the overflowing, blind emotions of the Sentient Soul. The Intellectual- and Mind Soul is the prevailing consciousness of mankind today. In it the \"I\" is clearly working, yet without becoming clearly conscious of itself. This happens only in the Consciousness Soul. Consciousness Soul: Here the soul grasps itself in its own being, in its \"I\". Rudolf Steiner says very beautifully: \"Therefore, this \"I\" cannot be perceived by the consciousness soul other than through a certain inner activity\". (34) This means that the Consciousness Soul does not live in thought and world contents, but in an amplification of the active soul forces. All contemporary meditation should as a goal have the development the Consciousness Soul. It is the most autonomous part of the soul, which in the widest sense is independent from the rest of the world. The sovereignty of the individual, as well as the sobriety and objectivity of the contemplation of nature, are fruits of the Consciousness Soul. It can open itself to the world of senses and to the spiritual world in the same way. It is the element that can influence man's actions from the spiritual world by impulses of the beautiful, the good and the true. The consciousness soul is equivalent of the \"Integrated Consciousness\" described by Jean Gebser and Ken Wilber. Spirit-Self: Every supersensory experience takes place in the Spirit-Self. It is the sense perception free consciousness - the higher self. It is also the level of consciousness of the angels. Life-Spirit: The spiritual world and its beings are a weaving, active life, with which we connect with our Life-Spirit. This can also be understood as an \"I\"-permeated etheric body. Spirit-Man: This is above all the highest self of man, the Cosmic Human Being, who can become infinitely large, a \"star-body\". From the eternal Spirit-Man, the individual phantom body is formed before each incarnation, which then forms the material body. Among the members of the human being there are also many individual spirit- beings, which constantly work on and with \"their\" human being. In the following I present three important categories of such beings. Angel: The angel accompanies the human being with an angelic patience over the incarnations. Our angels carry the overall panorama of our karmic connections and necessities. They are more developed than we, human beings, and acts on us from the sphere of the Spirit-Self. Every supersensible experience is mediated by the angel. Every night we sleep into the angel. After death, the angel guides us through the higher spiritual realms of the angelic hierarchies, also called planetary spheres. Through the angel the spiritual Christ-Light reaches us. The feeling of being with oneself, of being at one with oneself, of loving oneself and others, means being permeated by the angel. When the connection with the angel is disturbed, a person feels distant from himself or herself. In terms of aura, the angel is usually visible directly behind the person. Body-Elemental-Being: The Body-Elemental-Being is the co-worker of the angel on the level of the etheric body. It is the consciousness of our body and takes care of all organs and life processes, through incarnations. Aurically, the body elemental being is usually before or in the human being. Double: The Double is an unredeemed total amount of our human soul shadows - unredeemed feelings and traumas of all members of our being, antisocial and egoistic behavior patterns, and all old, not yet integrated karma. Aurically, the Double usually walks beside the human being, however, in unrestrained situations the Double takes the lead and represses the I. The person then behaves surprisingly aggressive or destructive. Everybody knows such situations, and often one does not know \"what possessed one\". In problematic human relationships the Doubles like to activate each other. The Double is in relation to the subterranean spheres of the Earth and the adversarial spirit beings. Adversary spirits Dark Subterranean Layers of the Earth: These are spiritual spheres of the earth where the collective, unsolved, old karma of mankind gathers. Traditionally, nine layers are distinguished. The Nine Beatitudes also refer to these inner layers of the earth. Dante Alighieri describes nine layers in his \"Divine Comedy\". Through our double, we human beings are in a relationship with these inner layers of the Earth. These should be illuminated in the long run, but frequently they darken the soul life at first. The dark earth inner layers are inhabited by adversary spirits. Bright Subterranean Layers of the Earth: These are spiritual spheres of the earth where light spirits and beings dwell. The \"love of Mother Earth\" flows through them. The Bright Subterranean Layers of the Earth are not connected with the Dark Subterranean Layers of the Earth. The adversarial Spirits Lucifer, Ahriman, Asuras: Besides the angelic hierarchies, which are oriented towards the divine love, there are also \"fallen angels\". Without their resistance the world could not develop. They also constitute us human beings. Among them are the Luciferic, Ahrimanic and Asuric \"dark\" angelic beings described in detail in Anthroposophy. The ahrimanic beings are the spirits of materialism, coldness, and darkness; the luciferic beings are the spiritless ones of arrogance, egomania and blinding light, the asuric beings are the spirits of fragmentation and dissolution of the \"I\". In Sanskrit, the term \"asuras\" is used as an \"evil spirit\" or opponent of the gods, as a generic term. Rudolf Steiner, on the other hand uses it to refer to a special kind of fallen angelic beings. All these adversary spirits belong to our spiritual planetary system and have - if they are redeemed and transformed with divine love and the \"I\"-power - very positive effects. I would like to emphasize that this is not a theory or a belief system. In the supersensible perceptions one constantly encounters these beings. It is a condition of a healthy spiritual path of knowledge that one learns to deal with these dark entities as well. Soratic spirits: These are the fourth group of the adversary spirits, which originate from spirit realms in distant cosmic times and expanses outside of our planetary system. They have no business in the spiritual space of the earth, but they are pushing their way in, nevertheless. They seduce people because they promise great power. People addicted to power easily fall for soratic beings, who are the inspirers of all evil. They are described in the Bible - in the Revelation of John, the Apocalypse, - as the two-horned beast. In the Gnosis the term Archons refers to them. Soratic Transhumanism spirits: A special group of soratic beings are called here transhumanism spirits, because they seem to inspire transhumanism. These are central to the understanding of Covid19 and the vaccines. Since these beings are associated with the very highest adversarial powers, it can be assumed that all processes emanating from them are extremely harmful to humans. This will become more understandable in the course of this book. Vaccine-Beings: Every vaccine has a being in the spiritual world, a kind of living original idea (one could also say \"group soul\" and \"group spirit\"). This is not an abstract idea, but a multiform spirit space filled with consciousness; a being-structure. With the vaccination those enter the human aura and work within it. In such case, there is the \"great\" vaccine being in the lower layers of the spiritual world and at the same time \"smaller\" replicas - one could also say \"descendants\" - working in the human aura. The vaccine-being is connected with other spirit beings, which give it a special character. For example, if it is connected with certain ahrimanic beings, they work through the vaccine- being in the vaccinated person. If it is connected with soratic spirits, then soratic spirits gain access into the members of the human being. Disease-Beings (Beings of Illness) : Every disease also has a being in the spiritual world, which connects with the human being when needed. After this spiritual-scientific \"crash course\" we begin with the supersensible observation of the corona vaccines. Supersensory observations on vaccinated people The adverse effects of Corona vaccinations on the body are only the tip of the iceberg. Behind this visible surface are the supersensible members of the human being. The following research and reports show that the corona vaccinations can have strong disturbing effects on the members of the human being. Of course, this varies from individual to individual. Vaccine is often not visible in people; they were able to overcome the destructive supersensible effects. However, the following descriptions are about cases where impairing effects were observed. Even if the focus of perception is put on it, it does not mean that it is always so. Each individual case must be observed anew. I write this in order to warn against generalizations. It is all about sharpening the attention and the power of perception. I begin with descriptions of therapists who work with the etheric body (the life force body) of man. Since the vaccination there is always a great sadness on my hands \"Rhythmical Massage support recovery on the physical, spiritual, and soul levels. During the massage, the hands are rhythmically moving over the body, often in a circular motion, to relieve bodily and mental tensions and blockages. Natural oils and ointments are used. The Rhythmical Massage was developed by Dr. Ita Wegman and Dr. Margarethe Hauschka. A therapist from Lower Saxony reported in April 2021: In the institution where I work, almost all residents are now vaccinated with Moderna. This has affected my work with Rhythmical Massage a lot. If I prepare myself intensively, I can let the stream of love flow. Especially in the back region of the patients it is absorbed with great need. Sometimes, however, I experience a sudden sadness, more around me than in me. Or I feel a subtle rejection to my actions. Frequently I experienced the following: As I massage the ankle, I turn to the angelic world in my back space and try to let the impulses for my actions be inspired from this area. In the past, during the renewed immersion, a force flowed through me to the patient. Since the inoculation there is always a great sadness on my hands. Once, during the treatment, I experienced a very strong blockage in my legs, as if I was being pushed away; later, a stickiness, as if being sucked into a swamp. In the past, I often felt as if I were immersed in a common etheric space with the person I was treating. Now I feel completely alone, and I can't make contact with their angel and their healing beings. When the patient is resting and I am sitting quietly, I often feel a strong pressure, a tightness around my head. After the treatments I am often exhausted, and I strengthen myself for example with eurythmic exercises I A O or nature observations in the garden. The people who are treated are not able to give any information about the changes I experience\". Similar experiences were made by other therapists. One osteopath told me that she experienced a cool etheric current flowing from the navel in some vaccinated patients. Where the flow went was not clear to her. I received the following report from a therapeutic eurythmist: \"In therapeutic eurythmy I have observed that vaccinated patients are like \"dense\", \"dull\", and \"closed\" in themselves. The awareness of a deeply felt eurythmy consonant-movement is hardly attainable on the etheric-soul level. It is shattering! Patients who have been coming for many years, for whom eurythmy therapy has always been a decisive help, suddenly can no longer feel. I have not experienced this in any treatment in the last 20 years A rhythmical massage and craniosacral therapist from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg wrote in May 2021: I have been working as a rhythmical masseuse since the 80's and as a craniosacral therapist for about 20 years. During the many years of therapeutic work, I have treated adults and children with very different issues. During a craniosacral treatment, a well-trained therapist with clairvoyant hands can sense changes within the body structure of the client. The therapist takes the client's feet or head in their hands. During such treatments I can very specifically perceive pain points and blockages in the whole body of the client. I can also perceive the condition of various organs of the client. One of the basic skills of craniosacral therapists is the perception of craniosacral rhythms. Since the beginning of the Corona vaccination campaign in Germany, I have treated two vaccinated clients. The experience of these two vaccinated with mRNA vaccines was new to me and at first frightening. In five craniosacral treatments performed so far, holding the head with both hands repeated the perception of holding a completely hollow, empty head. The etheric brain and the pineal gland felt like dried up and shriveled. Also, the otherwise perceptible surficial craniosacral rhythm was not perceptible. With none of my other clients, after more than 20 years of experience, have I ever had such experiences. She continued her report in June 2021: After the first observation of the change of the etheric body and the pineal gland described above, four more craniosacral treatments have taken place until today with one of the two vaccinated clients. Before each treatment I do a short meditation with the thought: \"Christ in me\". At the beginning of each treatment, with contact at the feet, I spoke silently for the client: \"May the healing power of Christ flowing through you\". With the third treatment a clear improvement was experienced. The etheric body and the craniosacral rhythms were more clearly felt. After the third treatment, the client performed a liver cleanse according to Andreas Moritz, followed by a colon hydro-cleansing. During the fourth craniosacral treatment, the pineal gland was again more perceptible, and the client spoke of no longer being just functional, but of being more in tune with herself, more able to concentrate and perceive herself. Her whole appearance radiated joy of life again. Due to the conscious step into the treatment with the short meditation - \"Christ in Me\" - I had no more pain in my arms during and after the treatment, as I described above. This pleasant report shows that it is possible to overcome the blocking supersensory effects of the vaccination. Corona vaccination can be a kind of test. We are now challenged to become strong enough to cope with these massive attacks. This was true for the client as well as for the therapist. As if a dark being were lying on top of her I received another differentiated report from a craniosacral therapist from Baden W\u00fcrttemberg in April 2021: \"Since I do bodywork, because of the vaccinations, I am now confronted with energies and entities which are partly shocking. I have the feeling that I must protect myself and now I even doubt whether I can continue to treat vaccinated people in the future without leaving the work exhausted. Especially in craniosacral therapy, where I am in direct contact with the etheric body and the other members of the patient's being, I deal with more and more unsightly and frightening images and perceptions and protect myself. I am deeply shocked by what these vaccinations do to people, without them noticing anything. As an example, I would like to tell you about the craniosacral therapy sessions with a 70-year-old patient, whom I know very well and who has been in therapy with me for many years. The first session took place five days after the first mRNA vaccination with the BioNTech Pfizer vaccine. I wondered about her CS rhythm, which I could not perceive. When she told me that she was now vaccinated, it became clear to me. I had the feeling that there was a dark being on top of her, inhibiting all functions. Stagnation and rigidity. The tissue was as if held, could not breathe and could not move, was no longer able to pulsate. In the second session it was even worse than in the first. There was practically no rhythm at all, complete rigidity. Like a thick, sticky mass inside the patient. At the feet I could not feel anything, completely broken rhythm. Also, in this second session I experienced again a formless being, dark, black, which laid itself around the upper part as if around it, holding on, as if in a kind of strangulation movement at the etheric larynx and whirring around. As a therapist, I had to be very careful. As soon as I worked with light, that is, with Christ light, the being had to give way. The patient did not notice it, no change in the cranio-rhythm, for her it was normal as always. Next sessions: Furthermore, no normal craniosacral rhythm was perceptible. Everything was still stuck and no movement, no inspiration and expiration was perceptible. Also, on the bone level no movement. At the end of the treatment once again I saw a strange, first gruesome-black, rather gray being. At the feet was not noticeable at all, completely broken rhythm. Also, in this second session I experienced again a formless being, dark, black, which laid itself around the upper part as if around it, holding on, like a kind of strangulation movement at the etheric larynx and whirring around. As a therapist, I had to be very careful. As soon as I worked with light, that is Christ light, the being had to give way. The patient did not notice it, no change in the cranio-rhythm, for her it was normal as always. Next sessions: Furthermore, no normal craniosacral rhythm was perceptible. Everything was still as if \"glued\" and no movement, no inspiration and expiration was perceptible in the living. Also, on the bone level no movement. At the end of the treatment, I saw again a strange, first grayish-black, later gray being. Maybe the vaccination being? Through the treatment, especially at the end of the treatment, there was in each case a calming down of the being, which before was buzzing around restlessly and irritated. It nestled as if around the shoulders, as if folded over and crawling into the body. I felt as if it had not yet crawled all the way in but was in the process of joining and blending with the body\". Unfortunately, after many weeks of therapy, there is no real progress, no movement. The patient cannot experience or comprehend these observations in any way. She has no perception of the being and changes in her vital functions and craniosacral rhythms. What is special about this report is that the therapist also reports about a dark being, which she calls \"vaccine being\", that has nested in the aura and the physical body of the client. I asked the therapist to report to me in case there was any development. In August 2021 I received the following: \"After 2 months of weekly treatment, for the first time her craniosacral rhythm reappeared, not in the same strength as before, but it showed itself, which made me very happy for the patient. Nevertheless, in the depth I felt that the tissue wanted to go even more into breathing, expansion and widening, but it was still somehow arrested. The movements are still more perceptible in the vertical plane than in the horizontal. The clear forms of the being are no longer perceptible, but I feel and see where it has settled down, so to speak, and that is: in the center of the body, on the midline and on her heart - there is something sitting on it. The tissue is as if solidified and no longer able to pulsate A rhythmic masseuse from Switzerland described other phenomena in June 2021: I had the opportunity to share observations with some other therapists who have similar perceptions. In addition, I have known many patients for a long time and can clearly perceive the difference between their state then and now. Often the patients themselves do not notice these changes. On the contrary, they feel really good now, they are relieved and happy and \"free\". Some, of course, display initial flu symptoms in the first few days after the shot. Only very few suffer and perceive more deeply. In most of the vaccinated people I experience condensation in the tissues especially after the second vaccination (often already after the first one). The tissue is as if solidified, no longer mobile, no longer able to pulsate. Also, a palpable cooling (coldness) shows up in many. With one patient I had the experience of massaging a \"corpse\". Even less than before, people have sensations of their coldness. There are visible changes in the face. The gaze often becomes rigid, the contours firmer or the people get a rather turgid face. The face becomes like a mask, transformed. That which wants to shine through is missing. Often, the old weaknesses and symptoms, which were already improved, reappear on all levels due to vaccination: For example, pain, joint blockages, muscle cramps and stiffness (for example in Parkinson's disease), hardening of the spine, tinnitus etc. In the soul life I often perceive a strikingly sharp-chiseled gesture, all the way to (latent) aggressiveness. In the soul-spiritual sphere I observed a phenomenon that I would describe like this: The abilities acquired over many months and years through the work of the \"I\" are once again pushed into the background. For example, old, basic fears, illusions, rigid ideas and patterns, etc. reappear suddenly. In some this went as far as clearly perceptible (temporary?) changes in their core being. The effect on me as a therapist is in a modified form like that of the vaccinated people themselves - if I am not vigilant and do not protect myself sufficiently. Above all I experience that sometimes, out of the blue, the forces are suddenly pulled away from me. It happens completely unexpectedly, even if I have a good day. If I am not completely in myself and especially in my hands, they become more immobile including borderline rigidity and pain. It is also necessary to guide the thought activity well; it is also in danger of being taken over by disturbing thoughts. This brings us to the perspective of the effects on the life of the soul. Psychotherapists are particularly concerned with this. Hardening in the Soul I received the following description from a psychotherapist from Hesse in April 2021: \"About one third of my clients are vaccinated, ten in total. I am no longer able to reach and experience them directly as I used to, but now have to do much more and take longer to get in touch with their \"I\". It feels like they are behind a concrete wall. The concrete wall feeling is with AstraZeneca; with BioNTech and Modern it is more as if the \"I\" is choked with lumps. Since the vaccination, I have experienced an increased influence of the dark layers, something has opened up. As a therapist I have to be more careful not to be drawn into something dark myself and I have to connect more consciously with the light. With the dark layers that are stored individually and collectively in the spiritual earth. I often feel alone in my work now. I know these clients well, but somehow, they are no longer there. In the aftermath of a session, I no longer feel the person, even though they were physically there. There is one exception. With a woman who meditates and has also thought for a long time whether she should be vaccinated, it is not like that. With her I do not experience any separation. Obviously, she was able to transform the soul-spiritual effects of the vaccination\". The Baden working group had similar perceptions in May 2021: \"While observing vaccinated people (with AstraZeneca and BioNTech) we perceived the process of increasing hardening in the soul-element\". Similar signature to cancer patients The following experiences with Dark Field Microscopy from April 2021 are not based on supersensory but on sensory perception. The spiritual world creates and shapes the material world and is therefore visible in it. It makes sense to support manifold examinations and to use different, also sense world methods of perception. An alternative practitioner wrote to me: \"As an alternative practitioner I am well versed in Dark Field Microscopy, especially in the treatment and diagnosis of cancer patients and autoimmune diseases. With this method blood cells and other structures in the blood can be observed in up to 1000 times magnification. I have noticed that in the cases where I have looked at the blood of vaccinated patients so far, it had a signature similar to that of cancer patients. The blood of vaccinated people also had a similarity to cases of very severe autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. In summary, this means that the Life Ether is almost absent. As long as I could observe this - although the observation time was not very long - there was no reaction to multiple therapeutic interventions, not even a positive change in time. If this should prove to be true, it would mean that a part of the vaccinated people could have a very unfavorable course in the occurrence of secondary conditions in the next 6 to 18 months, as we know it for example with secondary carcinomas after leukemia or lymphomas\". Like the Panther in Rilke Most of the time the vaccinated cannot perceive the changes in their bodies themselves, but some do. I received the following reports: Eleonore, a refine-sensitive woman, reported that dreams used to be very important for her. Since the vaccination she no longer dreams. Karin told me about her mother, who after long consideration had herself vaccinated. The mother wrote to her daughter after the vaccination that she felt like Rilke's panther: \"His vision, from constantly passing the bars, has grown so weary that it cannot hold anything else. It seems to him there are thousand bars; and behind the bars, there is no world.\" More reports from therapists and alternative practitioners All previous reports are from my personal network. The question arises whether such supersensible effects of the vaccines are also perceived by other people? Therefore, I researched in online forums of therapists and alternative practitioners, where there are also some who can experience supersensibly. What is their experience? I do not know the respective authors and therefore I cannot judge or confirm their way of working. Exactly this distance is an advantage to broaden the basis of experience. I found many confirming descriptions. The following is a selection. \"I do Healing Massage. I have a client who has been coming to me for a long time. Today she had an appointment with scheduled long time ago. My dogs did not greet her as they always do. I thought it was because she was not here for a while. I started my usual treatment, but it was different from usual. I just could not get into the depth. After half an hour I asked her if she was vaccinated, because I kept hitting a wall. 'Yes', she said, 'a week ago'\". \"We had the same experience in our practice for body therapy. You can't get into the tissue and the system of some vaccinated people\". \"I work as a naturopath and many patients unfortunately get vaccinated. I find some of them repulsive: strange color of their faces, aura field torn, as if they were disembodied. Some of them I cannot test bioenergetically at first, because there is an energetic shock on the kidney in the sense of a cybernetic blockade\". \"I also notice with some vaccinated people that the aura, which was previously strong and colorful, collapses and becomes gray. Yet this is not the case with all of them. When I do chakra balancing, some feel like after a chemotherapy, rigid, metallic, and almost not permeable. I would like to emphasize that this is not the case with everyone, with some I don't feel any difference\". \"Since early childhood I have been able to see people's aura colors. I am sensitive. I \"see\" aura mostly as a basic color with different colored speckles. When I meet with vaccinated people, my eyes often \"search\" for aura, but all I can see is a smooth gray surface, like concrete. This confuses me, no other color appears\". \"The aura of vaccinated people often changes. It becomes cracked, broken and unprotected from foreign energies. The energies of the vaccinated flow out unfiltered and foreign energies flow in\". \"I have a naturopathic practice where I also work osteopathically (i.e., on the patient, with contact). Three weeks ago, I had a patient who was vaccinated with J&J five days earlier, although he did not tell me about it until afterwards. During the treatment I noticed several energy tentacles that were docked. In addition, the general life energy was very low. I removed tentacles, stabilized his energies, and tried to reconnect him (grounding and upward). He was better the next day\". \"I am highly sensitive and can see people's aura. With some vaccinated people the aura is not colorful as with others, but gray and I can smell vaccinated people. The smell is sweetish and penetratingly unpleasant\". \"My husband and I do in body work. It is frightening to see how the vaccinated clients degrade. Their skin color changes, they seem to have aged for years, lymph nodes are swollen for a long time, the aura is \"tattered\" and many of them smell very unpleasant. \"I am an alternative practitioner; I also do energetic treatments and sometimes I can't find the energy field of people who have been vaccinated. This can be found next to the body of the vaccinated\". These are some of the reports from people who have psychic perceptions. These reports testify to the strong effects of Corona vaccinations on the bodies of the human being that make up the aura. These effects can be described in more detail. Detailed consideration of the effect of Corona vaccinations on the constitution of the human beings Some research groups can make detail supersensible observations of the human constitution. The terms used in the following reports are explained in the chapter on Supersensible Research. Those who skipped this chapter are recommended to return to it. The members of the Working Group Hessen are experienced and accomplished spiritual researchers who work together on a regular basis. From them comes the following three case studies. \"May 20, 2021: A woman had received a first vaccination with AstraZeneca. After that she felt bad and did not want to work anymore. She is a psychotherapist and became grumpy with her patients. The investigation revealed: - In her aura there was the Vaccine-Being of AstraZeneca, which influenced all members of her constitution - The spiritual members of her being (Spirit-Man, Life-Spirit and Spirit-Self) had a connection to the 9th subterranean region of the earth; they were influenced by it and blocked. - Through this relationship, the door to beings of transhumanism was opened, which began forming a spiritual metal-line in her spinal cord. - Her angel appeared in the imaginative perception gray and somewhat unsound. -On the level of the Intellectual Soul we experienced a blockage between the forehead and the crown chakra. We interpreted this as a separation of the Intellectual Soul from the higher self. - The effects of the Vaccine-Being also went into the astral and etheric bodies. In the etheric body we perceived many small demons moving chaotically and dissonantly, bubbling like champagne. - The Body Elemental Being was subdued in its activity. - In all chakras we felt blockages. These difficult effects must have come from the vaccination, because before that Elke was in a good condition. She also experienced these effects in the joint examination. She was shocked by the results and wanted to neutralize the Vaccine-Being and harmonize her bodies through spiritual healing work. This happened, and after that she felt a great relief. Gradually the will to work came back\". This example shows how profoundly Corona vaccination interferes with all members of the human being. Everything was taken over and impaired. However, the description also shows that such spiritual vaccine-damage can be neutralized if they are approached accordingly. It is important to emphasize this, so that the descriptions collected here are understood in the right way. It is a matter of looking at the reality soberly to learn and develop necessary steps. If reports frighten, one should not suppress it, but let oneself be touched by it. It must be digested. However, the next step is of course to develop appropriate ways out. Here another report of a differentiated consideration of the bodies and a successful harmonization from June 1, 2021: \"We could examine a woman vaccinated with BioNTech and found the following: - There was no spiritual connection to the Being of Illness of Covid19 as well as to the Virus-Being of SarsCoV2, but very strongly to the BioNTech-Vaccine Being. Starting from this we experienced strong dark intentions, behind it Beings of Transhumanism were active. We asked ourselves: Why do the Covid19 Illness-Beings not appear, although BioNTech is supposed to protect against it? We were surprised, because with other traditional vaccines a connection to the respective Beings of Illnesses is established. - The Body-Elemental-Being was considerably subdued in its function. - The etheric body appeared as if pressed together in a clamp. - In the astral body there was a narrow astral cord through the spinal cord and the chakras. - The sentient body was condensed in the abdominal cavity. - The angel appeared with a black core, his own spiritual connection to the higher angelic hierarchies was obstructed. (The angel was connected in a regular way in earlier observations). - The constituent angelic hierarchies, which create the physical body (i.e., the hierarchical beings, which convey the respective archetypes of the organs to the elemental beings), also had dark cores, their cosmic connection was hindered. - The mental body was strongly limited, there was something like a wall around it; we interpret this as a limiting effect on thinking. - The \"I\" appeared damaged, with spikes turned inward in the imaginative image. - The Spirit-Self was shadowed. - Life-Spirit and Spirit-Man were normal. The Being of BioNTech had taken over a similar function as a Being of Illness (Disease-Being). A Disease-Being is often like a taproot that cuts into different bodies of the human being. In spirit healing, the BioNTech being had to be removed step by step, each member of the human being was worked on, through cooperation with healing forces and the Ascended Masters. The woman had not noticed anything special at the beginning, only when she was gradually freed from the influence of the Vaccine-Being, she started to experience the difference. She commented: 'Now I can breathe again'; 'Now I can think again'\". In comparison, the examination of a J&J vaccination showed a somewhat more relaxed picture. \"A man from the USA got vaccinated so that he could continue working. We found: - There was a clear spiritual connection to Covid19 and SarsCov2, the connection to the Being of J&J was clearly weaker than in the case with BioNTech. Also, the connection to the Transhumanism beings was clearly milder. - There was a clamp in the etheric body in the spinal cord and in the lower back. - There was no apparent influence on the Astral Body and the Sentient Soul. - The Body-Elemental-Being was free. - Only the forehead chakra, throat chakra and solar plexus chakra were blocked, the other chakras were free. - The mental body had dark contours. - The \"I\"- substance appeared to Imagination stained with cone-shaped imprints. - Spirit-Self and Life-Spirit appeared conceal. - The guardian angel appeared on the leash of the J&J being, that is, the angel was dulled. - The constituent angels were free.\" Basic pattern of spiritual vaccine-damages In-depth investigations were also possible for the Eastern Germany Working Group. This summarized in June 2021: \"We were able to observe 20 vaccinated individuals on a regular basis during the last months. Even if the effects of the Corona vaccinations are individually different and change over time, there are some basic patterns which often repeat, which we summarize below. We observe the members of the human being in a detailed way. Normally these are arranged as follows (For clarity the representations are simplified) The normal constitution of the members of the human being is such that the etheric body and the \"I\"-organization surround the physical body. Sentient body with the soul members penetrates the thorax and the head. The Higher Self is located behind the head. The body elemental being dwells in the trunk and penetrates the whole body with its consciousness. The double walks by the side of a person. And the guardian angel guides the person near him, slightly behind him. The Corona vaccinations, regardless of whether with BioNTech, Modern, AstraZeneca or Johnson&Johnson, led to significant changes in the configuration of the bodies. After vaccination we often noticed the following: Typical effects of vaccination Vaccination often causes shifting of the members of the human being. The etheric body becomes smaller. The sentient body with the soul members (Sentient, - Intellectual - and Consciousness Soul) shift and lose the connection with the physical human being. The I-organization slips backwards and shows itself diminished; this same with the spirit core or the higher SeIf. Thus, the human being becomes more strongly bound to matter. The body-elemental-being should take care of the human being, now it leaves, and remains only in the proximity. Also, a separation from the angel occurs - angel and man can no longer feel each other. These are very painful conditions for these etheric and spiritual entities which carry and support the human being. Instead of them, the double of the person (the shadow, or the unresolved old karma) connects itself more strongly with the human being. From the spiritual dark subterranean layers of the earth come forces that affect the \"I\"- organization, the higher self, and the angel. We had the impression that the stronger effect of the Double relates to a strengthening of the ego, the lower \"I\" hardened in egoism. This sometimes manifested itself in a more self-confident appearance of the person, which, however, had the source in self-centeredness. In such encounters one did not meet the real human being as before, instead the ego and the \"primitive man\" were more pronounced. Effects on the organs Changes caused by the Corona vaccination were also perceptible in the supersensible layers of the organs. Just as it is possible to see the aura layers of the whole human being, it is also possible in the case of individual organs. Each organ and each cell are permeated by the etheric body, astral body, and \"I\"-organization. To perceive this, it is necessary to connect intensively with an organ through the power of concentration. Through such meditative connection Imaginations are available that tell something about conditions of organs. In repeated comparison between different researchers these inner impressions become more precise. We experience that with the vaccine, Ahrimanic, hardening elemental beings entered the organs. The astral body and the 'I\"-organization of the organs were clearly quenched and contracted. Also, the etheric body became weaker and connected more strongly with the material body; it became more physical in this respect. The changes in the higher bodies described here were found in smaller or bigger extent in all examined cases. In people whom we could observe continuously and who were not treated spiritually during the period of observation, the phenomena did not decrease, but rather became stronger over the weeks. This distortion within the spiritual constitution of the organs is caused by dark beings, which enter the human being through the vaccination.\" Three groups of beings In the descriptions collected here, three groups of beings appear. Those beings gain access to the members the human being through the Corona vaccination: First, the Vaccine-Being: These are spirit beings of the lower level of the spiritual world. They have a determining and intervening effect on almost all bodies of the human being and resemble various Illness-Beings. In the aura, one can experience these Vaccine-Beings as a taproot that goes down through the physical human being into all members of human constitution. They are descendants and local representatives of the group souls or group spirits of specific vaccines. Secondly, the soratic spirits of transhumanism: The vaccine beings are related to soratic spirits of transhumanism, which through them gain access to the layers of human aura. There they appear as black, sharp, sucking formations or spots, especially in the radius of about three feet and more, in the whole aura as well as in the highest members of the human being (I, Spirit-Self, Life-Spirit, Spirit-Self). Thirdly, small ahrimanized elemental beings: These occupy especially the etheric body and the organs. These three groups of beings seem to be the main causes of the described displacements and blockages within human constitution. The purpose of a spiritual healing is to remove these three groups of beings from the human aura. This should proceed out of the activity of the \"I\" of the vaccinated person, who ideally develops strength that makes it difficult for these beings to enter again. Based on my own observations I have the following picture: - If a vaccinated person does not engage in an active process, the spirits of transhumanism work in the whole aura; in such case they also strongly radiate into the environment. - If a vaccinated person has engaged in the process - consciously or unconsciously - then many spirits of transhumanism leave. Only deposits remain, as well as the Vaccine-Being, which is then more subdued in its effectiveness. At least this is how I have observed it on people who at first glance do not look like they have been vaccinated at all. - With increasingly active work, the Vaccine-Being moves further and further away from the human being, up to about six feet away. In such case it no longer has a determining influence. - The small Ahrimanic elemental beings give way for the most part when the spiritual levels are cleared. However, this should be controlled; often they still need specific complementary treatment. Working through the vaccination The question arises: how to process the vaccination? According to my impressions, this can be individually very different. I have experienced and heard most diverse stories in this regard. There are many factors that play a role. One's own decision to vaccinate: If one gets vaccinated out of fear or ideological conviction, there is a danger that the associated entities can penetrate deeper than in people with more composed motivations. Motivation of the doctor: The spiritual attitude of the doctor (or a person; trans.), who administers the vaccine also plays a role. The soul-spiritual atmosphere during the vaccination can invite or discourage hostile spirits. The patient can also influence this, for example, by praying during the vaccination. Awareness of the problem: If one is aware that vaccination may cause soul-spiritual damage and that one must take care of it - such awareness is priceless. This will become a starting point in the soul for a - conscious or unconscious - confrontation with the being of the vaccine. Without awareness of the problem, there is a danger for the soul of blindly falling into it and not finding a way to understand what is happening. Medicinal support: There are various possibilities with natural remedies and homeopathic medicines. For this, please consult an health practitioner or a doctor. Therapeutic support: All therapies that have a special effect on the higher members of human constitution can help, for example therapeutic eurythmy, rhythmical massage, craniosacral therapy, art therapy, etc. Basic spiritual strengthening: The more one regularly strengthens the spiritual connection through meditation, prayer, religious ritual, singing or reading spiritual literature, the less one is accessible for spiritual attacks. Spiritual-healing intervention: It seems to me very important to directly confront the beings connected with the inoculation in meditation or prayer; to meet them with the power of Christ, Archangel Michael (assertiveness), Archangel Raphael (healing power), healing Buddha or other higher spirit beings. Through this these adversarial beings can be removed from the aura and their effects can be transformed. Everything that is done in this direction has an effect, even if one is not able to discern this by personally. For support it may be useful to seek the help of an experienced spiritual healer. The processing of the vaccination should not be underestimated, as should have become clear from the previous descriptions. One is dealing with a class of adversary spirits that can quickly overwhelm one. Even if the processing needs only a few weeks with some people, others must work on it for many months. Study of the vaccines Having looked at the effects on vaccinated people, let us now look directly at vaccines to deepen our understanding. About mode of operation The investigations took place in several independent working groups. The following are representative excerpts from the reports, which give a lively and hopefully comprehensible impression. There were more investigations than the one mentioned here, the results always went in the same direction. For spiritual research a representativeness is needed, which opens an access into the \"information field\". Different research groups chose different methodical ways. The examinations revealed how the vaccines work on the members of the human being, and how they affect the connection with the angel and body-elemental- being. The following two reports are very detailed, and open the way to a possibility to follow the course of specific investigations. Possessive BioNTech On March 18, 2021, the working group Switzerland-Midland worked with Pfizer BioNTech. The investigation was carried out by Markus, who is a therapist trained in the perception of the living element and aura. Siegfried observed the process from the outside. Markus: \"I took a used ampule with vaccine residue in my right hand during a \"self-testing\" experiment and wanted to see what would happen. I deliberately got involved with the effect. After some time, it began to tingle and sting slightly, especially on the inside my palm, where the hand chakra is located. Then slowly a fine ray went through the wrist into the forearm and radiated further into the upper arm, changed over the shoulder from the right side along the neck to the left side of the neck and went over the back of the head up, touching the left sleep area, further into the head. After some time, this ray traveled downward through the head, toward the neck, and further through the chest, right past the heart into the left abdomen. There, approximately near the stomach, this pressure-pain settled, as if it wanted to penetrate the intestines with a gripping arm. I could clearly feel this pulsation as it slowly took hold. This pressure and pulsation lasted for several hours, even though I tried energetically to eliminate this \"something\" in me with the help of my body-elemental-being. Despite this deeply penetrating, throbbing pain, I fell asleep at some point. When I awoke in the morning, it was gone. This experience was very memorable, and I don't want to know what would have happened if it had been a full ampoule of this vaccine. Siegfried: I was present at the examination and concentrated on what was happening with Markus. Already after a few minutes there were massive reactions, so that he had to put the ampule away again after about seven minutes. I experienced imaginatively how a \"greenish\" spiritual substance, entered his body, and then took the path which he described. This substance appeared to be very poisonous and aggressive to his etheric body. Since he reacted a bit constricted, I tried to help with spiritual power and neutralize it through the upper chakras. This worked, but it was long and exhausting to get this poisoning process out of the body. The next morning Markus was symptom-free again. He is very skilled in spiritual work, and so he was able to work intensively on himself. We have done this test also with other therapists and doctors, each time practically with the same result. I feel cut off from the spiritual world The W\u00fcrttemberg working group met on May 5, 2021, with two observers: Here are my notes on the two vaccines, Pfizer BioNTech and AstraZeneca. We resonated with them and experienced this in our ether and astral bodies. For both of us they caused very negative sensations. The spiritual observation showed beings who have connected with the highest adversary powers and carry these powers up to the astral and aetheric. My perceptions: BioNTech: - Heaviness spreads on the ground, like fog, hanging shoulders, dark. - Qualities like depression. - Sink into heaviness, whole body becomes heavy and loses \"I\"- signature and uprightness. - I feel cut off from the spiritual world. - Like a dark blanket, waiting, impenetrable is above me and in the entire room. - Creative-spiritual impulses (for example, making music, meditating, social contacts, etc.): It takes a lot of effort to get up for it. Afterwards I feel better. AstraZeneca: - Headache in forehead, tightening. - Attack more directly on the \"I\" level, like shots. - Feels insidious, more invested, spiky (not that heaviness), more unpredictable. After about five minutes the effect was too strong on me, that I ended the examination and left the room. My colleague stayed longer and tried to evoke Christ-forces against it. When I came back, the atmosphere in the room was much better again. Effects of BioNTech, Modern, AstraZeneca and Johnson&Johnson are similar An important result of the studies by the various working groups is that the four vaccines leading the way in Western countries have similar effects. There are differences, but not significant ones. Below are some excerpts from protocols of various spiritual research groups. Effects on the member of human constitution: \"The physical body felt cramped, I had no more connection to the etheric body, the astral body was curled, my \"I\" slipped upward out of the aura\". \"Physically, I became angular and sharp-contoured, my movements also became like that\". \"I got a migraine and felt like a metal plate over my head. The body elemental being immediately left the body. The heart and lungs in the etheric body felt constricted, the rest of the body felt perforated. The astral body left the body. I could not get into the higher members of the being, and I could not get into the feet. The tightness in the chest was threatening and dark, I had to stop\". \"On and in my skin, I experienced a stinging, partly a burning. It felt as if my corporeality was slipping was slipping deeper into the earth. I had the sensation as if I were two people stuck inside each other. The sheath-man remains, the inner man slides deeper. My arms were inwardly as if pulled up, as if in a fall. My head was pressed and compressed. My uprightness ended just above my skull, and I had no more consciousness of the area above my head. My heart became heavy, and my breathing was labored\". \"The vaccine had a space-occupying and constricting effect. It formed a solid armor around me, my limbs were bound, immobilized, my body felt like a sticky mass, like tar. I had an experience the I am becoming soft like rubber. The head was like a roof collapsing into me, everything collapsed, like a skyscraper blowing up, from top to bottom\". \"In the head area I had a strong dizziness. In the physical-etheric, a dying process started from top to bottom, like an agony. In the atrial body there were hardly any connections to the physical-etheric area and to the \"I\". The \"I\" appeared to me like a frozen block with cracks, like in eralier times with car windows, hit by a stone. The Christ felt far away, as did the angel. Normally I experience them very close. I asked myself: What is it like in such a state in the life after death? It must be blocked after all. And how is it in the next life on earth?\" \"In summary, one can say that first the body elemental being is inactivated and then the connection to the angel, to the inner guidance breaks off. An experience of loneliness, isolation and coldness then sets in\". Effect on the angel: \"The connection to the angel behind me is weakened.\" \"It feels as if between the angel and me a steel trapdoor has fallen down, I now feel alone and cut off.\" \"The angel is gone; I have no more connection with him.\" \"The angel no longer entered the lower members of the being.\" But not only the connection of the human being to the angel was affected, but there were also descriptions that the angel himself was burdened: \"The angel collapsed; his previous uprightness is no longer there.\" \"Immediately the angel wanted to separate off; he experienced an attack.\" Soul and social life: How does the vaccine affect my needs, feeling life, work and life planning? \"I no longer felt the need to think and decide for myself, I became content to follow instructions, no questions asked. I became totally gray, everything doesn't matter, everything is ok. My mucous membranes became dry, I felt like a reptile.\" \"I experience distance, no connection, no feeling, no social contacts, I feel lost, my emotional life is cold.\" \"Everything should be strictly organized, I wish for order, I am resigned, on the run, only registering. In my emotional life, I experience shame, malice and maliciousness.\" \"Contacts do not interest me, I find distance to other people good. I am grateful for instructions and guidance. I do not have direction in life. In my emotional life there is no empathy, no interest. In my professional life I just want to function. In an attempted meditation I bump into a wall and am pushed back.\" So much of some impressions from the vaccine examinations. No relation to the illness The Hessen Working Group drew attention to another important aspect in its report from March 1, 2021: \"For every illness there is a living original idea or Disease-Being in the spiritual world. In case of an illness, a relation of the Disease-Being to the individual human being is established; This can be perceived in the aura. The Disease-Being remains in the aura through the length of the illness and in most cases also after the recovery - until the biographical reason for the connection is solved. Vaccinations introduce forced connection to Disease-Beings independent from biographical necessities; this prevents the being to detach from human aura in a natural way. We were able to observe two people who were vaccinated with BioNTech and made the following discovery: Both had no relation to the Covid19- Being or to the Virus Being of SarsCoV2. Instead, we found a new dark BioNTech Disease-Being.\" This means that instead of coping with the Covid19 disease, people receive a vaccine being in their aura, which then affects them similarly to a Disease-Being for a long time. On the Supersensible Structure of the Corona Vaccines Another point of view is the following: What can be discovered if we look not at the effects of the vaccines, but supersensibly consider the vaccines themselves? Often there were following impressions: Biting, dark spherical formations are visible in the vaccine aura. These are aggressive and attacking and they seem to be occupied by the Soratic beings. The working group East Germany described in April 2021: \"When looking at corona vaccines, regardless of variety, we found an etheric aura of about 8 inches around the ampule. Within it are countless water elementals that take care of the liquid of the vaccine. These are strongly ahrimanized, that is, associated with Ahrimanic spirit beings. The second type of entities are earth elementals, gnomes, who were also strongly ahrimanized, probably during the production of the vaccine. These are most likely responsible for the construction of the genetic information on the material plane. Elemental beings have the task to constitute the matter according to spiritual laws. The ones connected with the Corona vaccines, which we are dealing with here, relate to beings from the adversary spheres (Ahrimanic spirits). Thus, these elemental beings lose their positive attitude towards man and become aggressive. They can cause harm to man's etheric body, which consequently has negative effect on other members of the human being. We tried to perceive them imaginatively, that is pictorially, and to bring these impressions on paper. Since they have no visible form, they naturally do not look like that. Yet the peculiar mood of these elemental beings is expressed in the pictures better than words could describe it. Imaginative representation of Ahrimanic water elemental beings in the etheric aura of the vaccines: Imaginative representation of Ahrimanic earth-elemental beings in the etheric aura of the vaccines: These elemental beings are the ones who, together with other Soratic, Asuric and Ahrimanic entities, take up and change the supersensible members of human constitution.\" Machine-human as a goal It took many attempts before we understood the powerful effects of BioNTech, Modern, AstraZeneca and Johnson&Johnson. Important thing is that - spiritually speaking - at the core, these are filled with Soratic beings. Of course, all other groups of adversarial spirits are also involved. At first glance one can experience Ahrimanic beings, perhaps also Asuric beings. However, inside of them the Soratic beings are at work, setting the tone. These beings do not originate from the development of our solar system and in this respect must be considered as outer-planetary spirits. Unlike the Luciferic and Ahrimanic fallen angelic beings, they are not part of the development of our spiritual planetary system, described in detail in Rudolf Steiner's \"Occult Science\". (35) Through human unconscious attraction or conscious invitation, they gain access and can thus influence our life on earth. The Soratic beings are known for thousands of years; they inspire oppression, abuse, hatred, war, black magic, etc. But today a new kind is also emerging. Some people within my research network are skilled in perceiving the Soratic beings. Yet, this new species was at first incomprehensible and unclassifiable to us. There is also no established terminology for this species. We have chosen the term \"Spirits of Transhumanism\" because these beings seem to be at the spiritual core of transhumanism. Transhumanism wants to merge human being with machines and thus to abolish our soul-spiritual being forever. Supersensibly, the transhumanism spirits do exactly that. The spiritual effects are already here even if the brain is not yet connected to a computer - a dream of the transhumanists. They reach for the human being, and if they gain access, human beings loose - partially or completely - their spiritual connection. For this purpose, these beings possess especially the Phantom body (physical spirit body) and the etheric body. They \"glue\" them together and shut them off from soul and spirit and the soul-spiritual surroundings. In this respect these beings want to turn the human being into a \"Machine-Man\", cut off from the spirit. We found that all group spirits of the four examined vaccines are occupied by the spirits of transhumanism. Moreover, we found them in individual ampules, through which they enter the human being by means of vaccination. To spiritual experience they appear as \"devoid of the \"I\" metallic\", \"brute\" and threatening. A colleague encountered a leading group spirit of one of the vaccines. Its intention came clearly to light: \"I saw a high spirit being of the vaccine, a narrow, rugged, sinister figure, extremely evil, with a will of annihilation of everything that is human: The angel is as if cut off, the etheric pulverized, the soul subjugated, the Self extinguished. What remains are devoid of I, empty shelled automaton people; scrawny, rickety, metallic; they are to be held like puppets on a long string.\" Sinopharm neutral We examined two other vaccines: Sinopharm from China and Sputnik V from Russia. We were surprised that neither of them had any soratic transhumanism reference. Here are some impressions from the investigation of Sinopharm's Corona vaccine by the Northwest Switzerland Working Group on March 12, 2021, with seven observers: The angel stayed in touch. But is a bit stressed. Why? There are many small daemons, like flying sickles, but only on the astral plane. There is no soratic core. Where do these astral sickles come from? From the Sinopharm group soul. The physical body is fierily activated, the ether body is in motion, the astral body is neutral, the ego is pushed down. I meditate \"I am an I\", but to no avail. Why? Is the Chinese vaccine about people staying healthy, but not becoming too individual? From whom does such an intention come? Another report: My angel was hissed at, \"kneeled down\". There was anger in the background. The body was attacked to a lesser degree. Everything was wrapped in a yellow-sulfurous atmosphere that made dizzy. Very authoritative and dominant. But I didn't have to connect with the highest forces to counter it and required much less \"armor\" comparing to other Covid vaccines. In a debate we concluded that the Sinopharm vaccine is more tolerable than the four Western vaccines. The bodies are not so strongly attacked with it. Sinopharm seems to be embedded in the spiritual structure of the Chinese state power. It strengthens the impulse to be a good citizen. However, one does not have to follow these intentions if one has own individual power. We have examined Sinopharm only once; this research would have to be continued. This result was confirmed by the W\u00fcrttemberg working group in August 2021. They examined Sinopharm aquired from an Arab country and did not determine anything conclusive. The effect was neutral. How do you explain the difference? We could not determine this. However, it is known that the Western vaccines are new genetic agents, Sinopharm is a conventional vaccine. Sputnik V more neutral, but possible to overcome On February 26, 2021, six members of the Northern Switzerland Working Group for the first time investigated the Russian vaccine Sputnik V. We experienced a confrontation with the Covid19 illness, and no other effects. From the notes: The effects are very different - they are not aggressive; there are no soratic beings active. The angel remains present and participates in the process of neutralization. The effect on the physical body is: \"I am sick\", the etheric body is very active and struggles with the challenge, the astral body is forced to deal with the illness. Conclusion: It is exhausting, but it works. Sputnik V is a vector vaccine, similar to AstraZeneca, but its soul-spiritual effects were clearly different. It seems they depend not only on the type of vaccine, but on factors in the production and other things that we were not able to perceive. Over the months, however, further supersensible investigations of Sputnik V revealed cases of incriminating effects on the higher bodies. Why? We suspect that the dark powers of transhumanism have great interest in claiming the Sputnik V vaccine as well. Partially this seems to have succeeded. It is an embattled area. On April 29, 2021, there was mixed testimony at a research meeting. Some experienced Sputnik V as neutral or even friendly. But there were also statements like: \"Had strong disgust, the lower bodies were strongly pulled down. One thinks it is not so bad, but it is much worse\". \"Aggressive effects; it acts more on the lower members of the human constitution\". One observer said: \"I became ill, got a headache, like the onset of flu, and then could not perceive anything any longer\". Next morning this person stood as if beside himself until the following day. In retrospect, we realized that due to time pressure, we had opened ourselves too quickly for Sputnik V. Because of that he could not sufficiently carry out the mental safety measures necessary for meeting with the Vaccine-Being. One should not underestimate Sputnik V; no vaccination is harmless. Nevertheless, Sputnik V seems to be a bit more digestible. This is also confirmed by observations of Sputnik vaccinated people. Experiences with Sputnik V in Moscow The Hesse Working Group described on May 19, 2021: I made a trip to Moscow. In Moscow everything was open and very relaxed in the streets, quite different from Germany. The people there are quite normal. I did not notice any special spiritual radiance in vaccinated people. It is like a normal vaccination. I met six people who had been vaccinated, but they did not have strong radiance in their aura. They also did not get any physical side effects from the vaccination. Therefore, I did not investigate deeper. Every vaccination weakens a person and opens him to negative forces. When I compare Sputnik V with other vaccinations, it seems to be as debilitating as a diphtheria or polio vaccination, but not as debilitating as the smallpox vaccination. The vaccinated had a normal spiritual relation to the Covid19 disease being, to the SarsCoV2 being and to the Sputnik V group soul, always at a healthy distance. Sputnik V had no relation to the aggressive spirits of transhumanism. Additionally, with Sputnik V no special networks of the dead entangled by the dark adversarial spirits are active. This is usually different with the group souls of the Western pharmaceutical companies. This description from Moscow is clearly different from the observations of conveyed by people in Germany. On July 13, 2021, the working group Northwest Switzerland could investigate Sputnik V more precisely: We experienced strong side effects mainly in the etheric, but no impairment of the phantom body. In our estimation, a spiritual attack and a partial takeover on the Sputnik V vaccine has taken place. However, it is important to note that the spirit of transhumanism appears in the periphery, but does not come from within, as it does with the Western vaccines. Sputnik V does not force the transhumanism spirits into people, but it can pave the way for it. If one does not have the strength to hold against it, then the transhumanism spirits can enter also through Sputnik V. The vaccinated people themselves, or maybe the doctor has the possibility to prevent it. Spiritual Corona Vaccinations The Corona vaccines are filled with aggressive adversary spirits, which through vaccination anchor within the bodies of the human being. But is it possible to absorb these intrusive spirits without actual physical vaccinations? From the Hesse Working Group I received this remarkable report dated May 20, 2021: Heidrun is a nurse and was always totally exhausted on the days she had to vaccinate. She vaccinates with AstraZeneca and Pfizer BioNTech. The exhaustion was definitely related to the vaccinating, because on the days she wasn't involved in it, she was not exhausted. Heidrun described that after the day of vaccinating people, she felt constricted in her own skin, and as if her body was no longer her own. The examination showed that she had a spiritual relationship to the SarsCoV2 group soul but no relationship to Covid19. Thus, there was no Covid19 disease present. The relationship to SarsCoV2 could have been developed due to her working with the vaccines or from a normal encounter with the virus. It was striking that in addition to that, she also developed a relationship to the Pfizer BioNTech group soul as well as to the soratic spirits of transhumanism - even though she was not vaccinated. Normally such spiritual connection is not possible without physical inoculation. That is, these beings must have \"jumped\" over to her. The AstraZeneca beings did not jump over. After the spiritual cleansing from the relation to BioNTech and the beings of transhumanism, she felt better again. A friend wanted to speak to me urgently. She reported that she had been beside herself for a week, had hardly any energy, had lost her goals in life and many bad feelings were coming up in her. She did not know what had happened to her. It had been like this since Sunday. In the supersensible investigation she looked as if she had received a Corona vaccination. A part of her soul constitution and I-organization were removed for about 15 inches to the right; there was a blockage between the angel and her; in her aura there were dark beings, sparlings of soratic beings and spirits of transhumanism. She is a spiritually developed person, experienced in healing work she does with clients. And yest, she got caught. Nobody is perfect - in every aura there are holes of unresolved old karma. Through these holes beings connected to the corona vaccines may enter - even without the syringe. We discussed the impressions, turned with concentrated healing power towards those beings and after an hour she felt centered again and restored. A week later I had a similar experience, a friend of mine was down and didn't know what was wrong with her. In meditative diagnosis it turned out that in her \"I\" she was possessed by soratic spirits of transhumanism. Here again, the problem could be solved. Thus, it is possible to absorb spirits that work in the corona vaccine into the soul without being physically vaccinated. This is not at all surprising. This is also the case with the supersensible perceptions of these beings, but in a controlled and protected way. I write these experiences down because they could be helpful in certain situations. Just the realization that one could have taken in such beings can bring ordering clarity, so that the soul wins its own space again. In contrast, a physical inoculation is of course many times more profound and therefore more difficult to harmonize. Medication damage in life after death In order to classify the description of the side effects of Corona vaccination on the afterlife, it is first necessary to collect some corresponding experiences with other medications. The life after death is governed by laws. These are described in detail in anthroposophy and correspond with modern research on near-death experiences as well as with the esoteric knowledge of other cultures. In our materialistic time there is a superstition that one cannot know what comes after death. Yet it is possible - only we must be willing to look more closely. Today it is possible for many people to experience the deceased with whom they had a spiritual connection during their lifetime. One comes to very detailed perceptions by means of the supersensible research. For those who such experiences are not possible can study the content of the spiritual science and penetrate it with their thinking. For example, there is a well readable summary and many literature references from the working group \"Sterbekultur\". (36) The Afterlife In the following some typical stages in keywords - whereby the ways through the world of afterlife can be individually very different, depending on what the soul brings along. With death the material body is discarded. That is, the connections of the etheric body to the material body are loosened. With this, the etheric body expands. When a dead person is laid out, one can often experience how the entire room or apartment is filled with his or her etheric body. Since all memories are inscribed in the etheric body, they are released by the expansion and the deceased experiences a panorama of life - everything experienced is simultaneously clear and colorful for them. Normally, the angel can be experienced immediately by the dead person and through the angel the light of the Christ. Depending on the cultural context there are different names for it. Usually other souls, who have died before, come to receive the deceased and help them to find their way in the spiritual world. In the after-life phase of the Kamaloka, in the Moon-sphere, the dead are busy with the reappraisal of their life. They experience their \"corpses in the cellar\"; they also experience how their deeds affected other people. It is often not easy to endure this change of perspective. The dead also process collective themes and thus can gradually \"live into\" higher angelic regions. In the Devachan, in the spiritual world, a change takes place. The dead person expands from a \"point to peripheries\", from an individual to a cosmic human being. In the higher regions of the spiritual world, human being actively participates in the development of the world and the formation of karma for future incarnations. At the same time, purity and bliss continue to increase. However, there are many blockades and dead ends in the afterlife. Soul's Earth-bondage is a very big problem today. This is described very closely and in many ways in the book \"Bridges Between Life and Death\" by Iris Paxino (37). The book also presents methods to help how the dead. I have been working on this topic for many years and have published a long working paper on helping the dead. (38) After-death blockages can have etheric, soul, spiritual causes. For example, the shock of a very sudden accidental death can lead to an after-death binding. Unsolved and suppressed soul-traumas collected during lifetime often become an insurmountable blockade which the soul cannot get past after death. A too deep willful immersion in a materialistic way of thinking can lead to an darkening of consciousness in the afterlife. In consequence the soul does not perceive its spiritual environment. However, not only the state of soul and spirit affects the life after death; there are also blockages caused by a poisoning of the body. I came across this topic for the first time in January 2011. Cemented ether body after chemotherapy During a meditation class Martin was taken by a deep sadness, which surprised him, and kept him occupied throughout the day. We took a closer look and it turned out that his twin brother, Stefan, died of cancer six years ago at the age of 39. Stefan had been a folk singer in Ireland and lived a cheerful and carefree life. Before his death he was receiving strong chemotherapy and had a bloated face. The sadness that overtook Martin was not his own feelings, but the feelings of his brother. He was in despair, because he was not able to let go - he felt as if he was bound with iron chains by an external power. I didn't understand it at first, because in his soul Stefan was jovial, happy, and free; I couldn't find any bond at all. Only when I looked at his etheric body (life body) I understood that it was solidified like a black glue, compacted like asphalt. These were the consequences of chemotherapy. Stefan's astral body (soul body) could not separate from the ether body; his astral body was not able to leave his earthly life behind and enter the Kamaloka, that is, into the so-called Moon Sphere. This was not possible for Stefan, although he urgently longed for it. I found soratic-ahrimanic beings in his etheric body, which were obviously connected with the substances used in chemotherapy and thus had gained access to Stefan's body. These were side effects of the chemotherapy, which are not described in the package insert. It is known, however, that cemeteries prolong the lying time of dead bodies with chemotherapy, because these bodies do not decompose easy (39 - Frankfurter Allgemieine Zeitung 199, newspaper article from 9.5.1997, \"Chemotherapie verzoegert Verwesungsprozess\" - \"Chemotherapy delays process of decomposition\"). This is an earthly expression of what Stefan experienced in the spiritual world. We could not let this stand but were called upon to do our utmost to help. Through an intensive connection with archangels and the Christ and turning to the stuck etheric body, it gradually became so soft that Stefan's soul could detach from it. Stefan immediately spread a great cheerfulness and a lot of light, which was amazing. I saw the etheric body riding away with black spots. It remains unclear to me what this means karmically. What happens to these black spots? Martin knew about the afterlife theoretically, but he felt too united with his own experiences. We talked about it, and I told him the following sentence: \"Dear Stefan, thank you for your love and attention. Even if I do not always experience it consciously, we are united in our hearts!\" With this sentence, Martin's tears flowed down his cheeks, it was very touching, a reunion of twin brothers after six years of separation. Martin now has a very good spiritual companion in Stefan. While I was working on this text, I encountered a 24-year-old man who ran a YouTube channel and died of cancer a few days ago. A very light and refreshing soul, who is well on the path in the afterlife and was enveloped by his angel. However this young man too had dense lumps in his etheric body due to the chemotherapy, which were shaking him and burdening him. \"Had I known that\", I heard him moaning inwardly, \"I would not have taken these substances\". But unlike Stefan, he will be able to free his etheric body himself. Even though I often encounter such cases of after-death side effects of chemotherapy, it does not mean that it is always the case. I have also seen deceased people who went through chemotherapy without anything being noticeable to them. It certainly depends on the type and amount of medication and on how the chemotherapy was accompanied. If the patient actively turns the physical experience of chemotherapy into a spiritual transformation, it will positively influence the effect on the etheric body. Accompanying mistletoe treatment, other strengthening medications, art therapy, etc. will also have a positive influence. There is a need for research in this field. Exploded ether body In a 2007 lecture, Dr. Zoltan Schermann, an anthroposophical family physician from the Netherlands, gave a detailed account of a harrowing experience. (40) In his decades of practice as a physician, he had always refused to perform euthanasia, which is permitted in the Netherlands under certain conditions. But a long-time patient who was terminally ill strongly wished him to do so. Because of the long relationship, he could not deny this wish, and after much deliberation, he agreed. In order to understand his experience, it is first necessary to take a look at the normal process of dying. Dr. Schermann describes: \"During my work as a family doctor, I have witnessed the death of a person several times, mostly after a fatal illness. I have always been able to perceive that the etheric body changes in a certain way at the moment of death. At the moment when the soul leaves the body, the etheric body changes. It stretches to some extent, so that it expands over the physical body, but retains the form of the human body. At the level of the navel, the etheric body begins to contract and to rise like a thread. As a thin thread it flows up and disappears somewhere in the height. (...) This takes about three days.\" In Holland, euthanasia is carried out according to precise instructions. \"It is necessary to use two different drugs that are usually used for anesthesia and surgery. One, thiopental, is a barbiturate, while the other, rocuronium, is a muscle relaxant.\" \"I had to keep my promise, the moment had arrived for which I as well as the patient and her husband had thoroughly prepared. They had said goodbye and discussed everything that was necessary for them. They were both convinced that the euthanasia was right and timely. I arrived at the appointed time and found her in the hospital bed. Only her husband was present. Once again, I asked if everything was as she wanted. She answered in the affirmative and asked me to carry out the euthanasia. I injected the barbiturate first, then the rocuronium. I waited for the moment of death to see what would happen. But something happened that was completely different from what I had expected. Instead of the silent dissolving of the etheric body, as I described it before, the etheric body welled up. It vehemently swelled up and exploded into countless pieces. The room was full of shimmering shining and swirling scraps. The process lasted only a short time, less than a minute, then everything dissolved and disappeared. The light in the room became dim again, as before, and her husband seemed to have noticed nothing. And there I sat, the syringe still in my hand. I was very, very frightened. Many things became clear to me suddenly. It suddenly became very clear to me where the lie was. It is not only that dying comes too early, and that one is not able to pass through the process illness fully. The matter goes much, much deeper, goes much further.\" (...) \"One believes to be merciful, to help someone. To help someone who can no longer bear their suffering from the disease. And afterwards, everyone should be satisfied. Her husband is to this day. But in fact, something completely different happens. We do something that outwardly seems helpful and humane. But what happens? The human being is catapulted into the cosmos without after-death memory, without after-death life panorama and without spiritual light, because his etheric body explodes.\" (...) \"Still, something else happened. Because I was so frightened, I was perhaps a little loosened and could perceive more. Suddenly, I became aware of an angelic figure. He was standing to the left of the dead woman. A tall and serious figure, frightening and powerful. I could feel how its strength and power far surpassed human strength and could not be compared with it. (...) It was clear to me that he had been waiting for me to notice him. But he did not say anything, just looked at me seriously. It became clear to me that I had thwarted his work. He approached me, stretched out his hand and pointed at me. And he wrote in me. I felt that he was writing in my bones. He looked at me, pressed something into my bones and then disappeared. At that moment I did not understand what he had written in my bones. But I felt somehow relieved that he had done that. I literally felt in my bones that one day I would get the chance to make up for something here. The threads were already spun. He will bring us together. I am convinced that the explosion of the etheric body is directly related to these medicines. In all other situations, when it was necessary to use traditional medicine in the final stage of the disease, I have never seen anything like that. I mean for example morphine, strong sleeping pills, tranquilizers etc. Here you can see very clearly how the Ahrimanic works. The society develops a procedure, a system. One has a well-defined procedure that looks neat and is even recognized by law. A procedure that offers a solution to hopeless suffering. (...) But in the hidden, in the invisible, something completely different is happening. The people who are subjected to this procedure are pushed out of their karma, get lost in the after-life realm. (...) But just this, the materialistic worldview will never notice.\" Gray cocoon and prevented spirit birth after morphine end- of- life support Even though the morphine preparations do not \"explode\" the etheric body, it is not as harmless as it might seem from Dr. Schermann's statements. Old people and the dying are very often given morphine today. How does it affect the afterlife? An anthroposophical doctor, together with her clairvoyant friend, has studied this over a long period of time. She shared their observations with me. The soul normally swings back and forth between the spiritual and earthly worlds. Through the morphine this oscillation is slowed down, something like a dense gray cocoon forms around the soul. This cocoon is created by a more immobile and opaque etheric body. Therefore, the soul does not experience a clear life panorama after death, it remains foggy and blurred. Normally, death is a glorious and sublime moment, the victory of the spirit over matter - one beholds one's life in a retrospective like the Father-God in Genesis on Sunday of the creation. Morphine severely interferes with this solemn act that the dead should experience and with their birth into the afterlife. The karmic processing and preparation for future incarnations is presumably impaired by the impaired life panorama. The doctor also told me that they tried to accompany the deceased at the moment of death. With the help of Michael and Christ and with the power of meditation and prayer, this cocoon could often be dissolved so that the deceased could still see his or her life panorama clearly. Spiritual intervention at the right moment can make a difference. In my own experience, souls can usually overcome the morphine effect in the afterlife, and the cocoon is broken down. To what extent the failed after-death processes can be made up for is unclear to me. The effects of psychiatric drugs in the afterlife A colleague studied Melperone, one of the most common drugs for agitation, anxiety, and depression. She let the drug act on her bodies and experienced that the \"I\" and the astral body were pushed into the etheric body and the physical body and held in them. As a result, the \"I\" activity was paralyzed, and the astral body became more agile; dullness and rigidity developed. It can be assumed that this has an effect on the sleep and that the \"I\" and the astral body could no longer be regularly released from the etheric and the physical bodies at night but remained stuck in it. The soul could no longer be among spiritual beings during the time of sleep. With that, the consciousness of the spiritual world would be extinguished, and the soul would be put into an artificial immobility. Such was the experience of a woman whose mother was given Meloperon while living in the old people's home. The lady, who was over 90 years old and spiritually awake, put into something of this condition in desperate words: \"I am not anymore! I am no longer here!\" Looking at the daughter who visited her, she said: \"Here you come, and I should be happy, but I feel nothing\". - She could no longer rejoice or take part in anything. She also lost interest in anthroposophy, even in praying, which had been part of her life for decades. This condition did not stop with death. Years later it was observed that the soul of the old lady was still in isolation and could not enter a regular Kamalokoa process. It lacked the ability to deeply feel the consequences of one's own deeds in the souls of others. She had an awareness of herself, also memories of her life on Earth, but only from her own point of view. She was stuck in a certain immobility of the soul and could not directly perceive or feel the spiritual surroundings of the human souls belonging to her, or even sense them in the distance. She lived isolated and surrounded by darkness. She received light and warmth only through the loving care of the living - their requests, meditations, and spiritual thoughts. However, these attentions could not fundamentally change the state of isolation itself. This was only achieved through targeted extensive Healing Meditations. What is shocking about this case is that even people who had lived intensively with anthroposophy could be kept in a gray cocoon - in loneliness and without direct perception of their spiritual surroundings - caused by psychotropic drugs Their process of development in the Kamaloka can be severely hindered by this for years. Debris field after antibody therapy Over the years, I have repeatedly encountered the after-death side effects of medications. Very impressive was the case of a fine old lady. We found her after death in a devastated state, completely desperate, lost, and shocked. The view of her etheric body was almost unbearable, like a field of debris with many buried mines that threatened to explode if one entered the area. This is a terrible state, because the etheric body carries all the memories of the past life, in this respect it is a spiritual home. Even if the etheric body keeps enlarging and merge with the world-ether, the soul always looks to it as its home in the afterlife. This home was destroyed for the old lady. Her spiritual powers were not nearly enough to change her situation. We helped her as much as we could. How could it come to this? She was suffering from various diseases, not unusual for her age, and from cancer. Under pressure from her family, she was put on a modern individual antibody therapy, the best on the market. It cost the health insurance company between 100K and 200K euros. She died anyway. We had the impression that it was mainly the antibody drugs that destroyed the etheric body, although other drugs may have contributed. Neglecting the after-death side effects is brutal With these examples, it is not said that all orthodox medications work this way. Many do not, but some do. Such after-death consequences resemble torture. However, the after-death side effects of drugs are not investigated and considered at all. In our society probably not a single cent of tax money has been spent for this. How many billions of public monies, on the other hand, are spent on the development of drugs that cause the greatest suffering after death? What does this say about the condition of our society? The problem has been known for a long time. Rudolf Steiner spoke a hundred years ago very clearly about how material substances can have an after-death effect, for example cyanide. The fragmenting effect of cyanide can lead to the real death of soul and spirit Of course, cyanide is not a medicine. But by this example Rudolf Steiner makes clear how the ingestion of material substances can affect the life after-death. Rudolf Steiner on this in his lecture of October 10, 1923: (41) \"And the bad thing is that there is always a danger, when a person is poisoned with cyanide, that this will take the soul with it and that the person, instead of being able to live on in the soul, will be distributed in the whole world, especially in the sunlight. If anthroposophical knowledge would spread, no one would poison themselves with cyanide anymore. It would not even occur to anyone! That poisoning with cyanide occurs is only the consequence of the materialistic world view, because people believe: dead is dead, no matter whether one suffers death by cyanide or by the inner disorganization. But it is not the same! If one suffers the death by the inner disorganization, then soul and spirit will go the usual way into the spiritual world; they just live on. But if you are poisoned by cyanide, then the soul has the intention to go everywhere with every cell of the body, and especially to spread out in the nitrogen and to dissolve in the universe. This is the real death of soul and spirit. If people would know that soul and spirit is the real human being, then they would say: We cannot possibly cause this terrible explosion, which is then caused in a fine way in the whole universe, when a man poisons himself with cyanide. - Because every man, who poisons himself with cyanide, connects in an incorrect way into the current, which goes from the earth to the sun. And one should see, if one had the right instruments, a small explosion in the sun every time a man poisons himself with cyanide. And the sun gets worse because of it. Human beings destroy the universe and also the power that flows from the sun to the earth when they poison themselves with cyanide. Man has a real influence on the universe. If a human beings poison themselves with cyanide, then it is so that they actually ruin the sun! It is with every cyanide poisoning.\" The hierarchies still have an interest in saving the human soul How can it be that a substance from the physical-material world can have such a great effect on the afterlife and the spiritual world? And does it really mean irreversible destruction for the people who die of cyanide poisoning? These are the questions that occupy Georg Groos (1899-1967). One of his tasks as a watchman at the Goetheanum was to supervise Rudolf Steiner's way from the \"Hansi\" house, where he lived at that time, to the carpenter's workshop. Thus, he had the opportunity to listen to Steiner's lecture of October 10, 1923, through the wall of the carpenter's workshop. He had difficulties in understanding the effect of the cyanide that had been revealed. He writes in his memoirs: \"Since I could not imagine that a physical substance of material origin could have an effect on the soul, that it would still be influenced by it after death, I asked Rudolf Steiner the question. Rudolf Steiner was immediately ready to explain it to me. He said something like this: The etheric body of the human being is connected to the physical body through oxygen. At the moment when cyanide enters the body, (...) the etheric body is torn apart, and the human being also has no review of life. Yet, the hierarchies are still interested in saving the human soul, which is a horrid work for them. Such a man comes into the world handicapped in the next incarnation, which can be compensated only in several embodiments. With these statements the question arises, what effects had the Holocaust, in which millions of people were gassed with Zyklon B, which contains cyanide? Is it the same if someone commits suicide with it or if is murdered with it? (43) There is certainly a difference. But there is no blanket answer to this question; there are different cases: On the one hand, there are people who have memories from a previous incarnation in a concentration camp or extermination camp and speak about it publicly, so for them the described fragmentation no longer plays a role. On the other hand, I know from my own experience that there are still many completely fragmented souls. And then I know the case of a woman who died in a gas chamber in her last life and in whom we found a partial fragmentation of the phantom body in an area of the body and worked on it. Taking medications and drugs can have big effects on the afterlife. Matter and spirit are closely connected, more closely than is often assumed. Even if the material body dissolves after death, the phantom body and the etheric body continue to exist and influence the soul and spirit. What are the after-death effects of corona vaccines? \"Do not fear those who can kill the body but not soul. Rather be afraid of him who can destroy both soul and body in the life after death.\" Gospel of Matthew 10-28, translated in German by Emil Bock. English translation "}
