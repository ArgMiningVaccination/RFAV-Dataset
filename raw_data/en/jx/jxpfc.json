Homeopathy derives from the Greek words homeo, meaning \"similar,\" and pathos, meaning \"suffering\". Homeopathy operates on a \"like cures like\" principle that has been used empirically for more than 200 years. A patient suffering from symptoms can be treated by micro-doses of a substance capable of producing similar symptoms in a healthy person. Homeopathic medicines stimulate the body's physiological reactions that restore health, with a very low risk of side effects due to the use of micro-doses. An Example Homeopathy is based on the principle that you can treat 'like with like', that is, a substance which causes symptoms when taken in large doses, can be used in small amounts to treat those same symptoms. For example, drinking too much coffee can cause sleeplessness, nervousness and agitation, so according to this principle, when made into a homeopathic medicine, it could be used to treat people with these symptoms. Instead of masking symptoms, the medicine sends the body a signal to help it rebalance and heal. Benefits of Homeopathic Medicines Natural \u2014 The active ingredients in homeopathic medicines are diluted natural ingredients that relieve the same symptoms they cause at full strength. Scope of Use \u2014 Similar to other over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, homeopathic medicines can be used to relieve symptoms of a wide range of acute health conditions such as allergies, coughs, colds, flu, stress, arthritis pain, muscle pain, and teething. Quality-controlled\u2014 Homeopathic medicines are manufactured according to the highest standards, complying with specifications of the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS) and Drug Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Safe \u2014 Homeopathic medicines are one of the safest choices for self-treatment. - No known side effects such as drowsiness - No interactions with conventional medications or herbal remedies - No contraindications with pre-existing conditions - No masking of symptoms Homeopathic Dilutions The most common is \"C\" dilutions, centesimal dilutions. The 1C is obtained by mixing 1 part of the Mother Tincture (MT) with 9 parts of water or alcohol in a new vial and then vigorously shaking the solution (succussion). The result is a 1/100 dilution of the plant (the MT being a 1/10 dilution of the plant itself). The 2C is obtained by mixing 1 part of the 1C with 99 parts of water or alcohol in a new vial and succussing. Recurrently, the 3C is obtained by mixing 1 part of the 2C with 99 parts of water or alcohol in a new vial and succussing. X dilutions are decimal dilutions prepared similarly to C dilutions, but the factor of dilution is only 1/10 from one dilution to the next. The 1X means the dilution contains 1 part of the MT combined with 9 parts of a dilutent. The 2X means the dilution is 1 part of the MT and 99 parts of water or alcohol, or a 1% extract. "}
