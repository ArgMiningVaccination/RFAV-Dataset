Abstract Communication project work, carried out in Santa Clara de Saguier, Santa Fe, Argentina, and its nearby towns. Its main objective was to address the issue of vaccination to obtain a high percentage of inoculated. Inform the general population about the importance of vaccination and compliance with the complete vaccination schedule for COVID-19, with emphasis on vulnerable groups. Treatment and special approach to risk groups. Keywords: Communication; Vaccines; Risk; Message; Objective; Covid Specific Objectives (Introduction) Inform the population, making use of massive dissemination with national, regional and local scope, prioritizing the well- being of individuals, families and communities in relation to timely and complete vaccination. Provide informative materials, by audience segmentation, with accessible language, which favors information and ac - ceptance of vaccination. Promote co-responsibility and social participation of the different organizations and key actors, in the planning, or - ganization, execution and evaluation of concerted actions in favor of immunizations at the national, regional and local levels. Target audiences General population. From the vaccination of the entire target population in a staggered and progressive manner, according to the prioritization of risk and the availability of vaccine doses.Introduction Vaccination is the best tool to prevent some infectious diseases and is one of the public health measures that has saved the most lives throughout history. Vaccines help people survive. Vaccines save 5 lives every minute. The eradication of smallpox serves as an example, a serious disease that left even survivors with lifelong consequences, saves approximately 5 million lives each year. If a vaccine hadn't eradicated smallpox, someone would die from smal - lpox every 6 seconds every day. Before the introduction of a vaccine, as recently as 1980, measles caused more than 2.6 million deaths worldwide. Vaccines can only save lives if people are vaccinated. Fortunately, most people get vaccinated. For example, 85% of child - ren around the world are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough, and in 125 countries that figure exceeds 90%. In most countries, the vast majority of people vaccinate their sons and daughters, which is an important contribution to public health and to people's lives. Vaccination is the best way to be protected against diseases that we can prevent. Protect and protect yourself with vaccines.

This is what is called herd immu - nity. Vaccination protects our health and that of the people we care for. Protect future generations. On December 31, 2019, China reported the appearance of la - boratory-confirmed cases of a novel coronavirus infection (SARS- CoV-2) that subsequently spread to various countries on all con - tinents. On January 30, 2020, the WHO Director General declared that the outbreak of the new coronavirus constituted a public he - alth emergency of international importance (ESPII) within the fra - mework of the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR 2005) and finally on March 11 In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the state of a pandemic. COVID-19 has been shown to present with a higher risk of hospitalization, complications and death in individuals belonging to certain risk groups (adults over 60 years of age, people with obesity, diabetes, chronic heart, respi - ratory and kidney diseases, immunocompromised, among others). In those older than 60 years, diabetes and heart failure were the as - sociated risk factors that occurred most frequently; while in those under 60 years of age they were diabetes and obesity. The number of people who have died in the world, and what has been described above, shows that the pandemic caused by this new coronavirus (SARS- CoV-2) is causing enormous human, health, social and eco - nomic costs in the world. Figure 1 The vaccine as a tool The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends vaccinati - on against COVID-19 as a fundamental primary prevention tool to limit the health and economic effects of the pandemic. As a con - sequence, having effective and safe vaccines available in the short term, which can be used in a national strategy, will help reduce the incidence of illness, hospitalizations and deaths related to CO - VID-19 and help to gradually restore a new normality in the fun - ctioning of our country. The development of vaccines with these characteristics, their acquisition, distribution and administration represents an unprecedented challenge worldwide. Vaccination against COVID-19 is an important tool to help stop the pandemic. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safeVaccines against CO - VID-19 were developed based on scientific knowledge used for decades. Vaccines against COVID-19 are not experimental. They went through all the required stages of clinical trials. Extensive testing and monitoring have shown these vaccines to be safe and effective. Vaccines against COVID-19 have undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in history. It is increasingly necessary to reinforce the risk communication component as an essential tool to adequately transmit all the in - formation about the immunization process to the population, from clinical trials and the production of new vaccines, to the introducti - on, distribution and prioritization of groups to which one or several vaccines must be administered; as well as universal access to them, once priority groups have been immunized. There is no doubt that vaccines will help save lives and contain the pandemic. However, this growing hope should not weaken the continuity of other well- known health measures that are helping to reduce the transmission of the virus, including the correct use of the mask, hand hygiene and physical distance. Vaccines and vaccination are only the beginning of a long road to contain the pandemic, but by no means the end. The challenges we face in this process are multiple, and a correct communication strategy will allow us to raise awareness and achieve greater global acceptance of vaccines. Vaccines against COVID-19 The speed with which the COVID-19 pandemic was installed and the severity of its consequences has generated a race to obtain effective and safe vaccines, which is unprecedented in the history of immunizations. In less than a year, more than 250 different re -10The Importance of Vaccination in Times of Pandemic Citation: Castillo Nicolas . \"The Importance of Vaccination in Times of Pandemic\". Acta Scientific Biotechnology 3.5 (2022): 09-16.search projects were launched, some of which have already obtai - ned emergency authorization for their application on a population scale. In its updated overview as of April 13, 2021, the WHO lists 88 candidate vaccines against COVID-19 that are already being in - vestigated in humans, and another 184 that are in the pre-clinical investigation stage. All of them seek to stimulate the host's immu - ne system by exposing it to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. To achieve this, different \"platforms\" are used that use both traditional and new technologies, which are described in RACIM: COVID-19 Vaccine Platforms. Within this haste to speed up research as much as pos - sible, in many cases the initial clinical stages (Phases 1 and 2) have been brought together in a single study, and Phase 3 investigations have been initiated, with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. All the results known so far of the vaccines that are already being applied correspond to the initial findings of these Phase 3 studies, whose final result will have to wait until the follow-up period is comp - leted in 2022 or 2023. For this reason, all the Use authorizations from regulatory agencies are of an \"emergency use\" nature.

For this reason, all the Use authorizations from regulatory agencies are of an \"emer - gency use\" nature. In this context, it is expected that the profile of adverse effects of each vaccine will become better known as they are applied to tens of millions of people. Thus, infrequent adverse reactions arise, which must be assessed to decide whether or not they represent an effect attributable to the vaccine, or a casual coincidence. It may be necessary to interrupt the use of the vaccine until doubts are cle -ared up, and eventually reformulate the indications or precautions for that particular product. The vaccines against COVID-19 that are currently approved by the WHO or in Phase III, are being developed under 4 main plat - forms: Vaccines with inactivated viruses: They use a previously inactivated virus, so that it does not cause the disease, but still generates an immune response. Protein-based vaccines: They use harmless protein frag - ments or protein structures that mimic the virus that causes COVID-19, in order to generate an immune response. Vaccines with non-replicative viral vectors: They use a genetically modified virus other than SARSCoV-2 that cannot cause the disease, but can produce coronavirus proteins to generate a safe immune response. Vaccines with messenger RNA : A pioneering approach that uses RNA to generate a protein that by itself triggers an im - mune response against the coronavirus. The vaccines that are in use are: messenger RNA vaccines (tozi - nameran from Pfizer-BioNTech from the CoronaVac from Sinovac WIBP from from other viral (Sputnik EpiVacCorona from Vektor Institute. The highest efficacy against symptoms obtained so far by a vaccine against COVID-19 is 95%, a value similar to the natural immunity obtained when infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Ot - her vaccines, however, have a lower efficacy, some of only 50%. 4 Another important difference between the different vaccines is their storage temperature. While inactivated adenovirus or coro - navirus vaccines are stored in refrigerators, messenger RNA vac - cines require freezers at -20\u00baC (Moderna) or even - 80\u00baC (Pfizer), which complicates their distribution. Due to the limited production capacity of vaccine manufacturers, states have had to implement phased distribution plans, which prioritize the population at risk, such as the elderly, and to people with a high degree of exposure and transmission, such as health workers. The most widely used 11The Importance of Vaccination in Times of Pandemic Citation: Castillo Nicolas . \"The Importance of Vaccination in Times of Pandemic\". Acta Scientific Biotechnology 3.5 (2022): 09-16.vaccines today have been in use for decades, and millions of people safely receive them each year. In addition, there are several new vaccines in development. If approved, they will help prevent more deadly diseases - for examp - le, COVID-19 or diseases caused by the Zika virus for example - or improve the effectiveness of existing vaccines. Like any other medi - cine, vaccines must undergo extensive and rigorous testing before they can be introduced into a country. Once they are in use, they must remain subject to ongoing surveillance to ensure that they are safe for the people who receive them. As with all medicines, the safety of vaccines must be subject to continuous surveillance, even after trials and the introduction of a vaccine. This monitoring ta - kes into account reports from various sources. At the national level, These sources include people receiving the vaccines, their parents or caregivers, and health care workers. The reports obtained are sent to the national health authorities. At the regional and global levels, WHO and UNICEF assist countries in collecting and tracking such information, and ensure that countries have the most up-to- date evidence on available vaccines. Risk communication It is common for new vaccines to be received with initial doubts that are later resolved as the program consolidates. Transparent and effective risk communication can help in this process. Commu - nicators need to be aware of cultural and emotional differences, but also recognize that some people are adversarial or misinfor - med and resist vaccination. Risk communication should recognize that COVID-19 vaccines have transient but bothersome side effects, such as fever and muscle pain. Ironically, these side effects show that the vaccine is working because it prepares the body to fight the disease. Life is risky, and some tragic events will happen after a vaccination, even when the vaccine had nothing to do with it. It is important not to jump to the conclusion that there is a connection between vaccination and these events. The only way to determi - ne whether vaccines have serious side effects is through scientific methods, looking at data from many vaccinated people and compa - ring it to what would be expected in that age group just by chance. When this is done, scientists find clear evidence that vaccines do not cause the vast majority of serious diseases and conditions that have been attributed to them in the media. looking at data from many vaccinated people and comparing it to what would be expe - cted in that age group just by chance.

When this is done, scientists find clear evidence that vacci - nes do not cause the vast majority of serious diseases and conditi - ons that have been attributed to them in the media. Risk communication is considered an essential axis to deal with emergencies that affect public health and is one of the components required of the Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) by the International Health Regulations (IHR). Through it, the community knows the risks and makes informed decisions to protect their health and that of their loved ones. Likewise, risk communication allows a two-way dialogue between the authorities and their audiences with the aim of generating behavioral changes. Proper management of this process contributes to a better emer - gency response and reinforces the leadership of the authorities in charge and the confidence of the population in them and in the established measures. Also very important at a communicational level is the recommendation of a health professional, which is one of the most determining factors for the acceptance of the vaccine. However, health professionals often underestimate the importance of their recommendations. A strong recommendation to be vacci - nated, which assumes that the person is willing to do so, has been shown to increase uptake. The professional's message must be cle - ar and effective and the listening approach must be active. Engage communities Community leaders can play a crucial role: group norms and ha - bits have a strong influence on group members, so having commu - nity leaders mention positive norms towards vaccination is helpful. Community leaders must engage with empathy, transparency, and honesty to build and maintain public trust and communicate effec - tively. It is important that there is a large representation of diverse community groups in the engagement activities. Role of social networks Involving the public in spreading the message can be helpful. Social networks can also be an advantage. The use of social net - works brings a new dimension to the science of health communi - cation, since it is a medium used by professionals, patients and by any Internet user, which allows infinite interactions between the 12The Importance of Vaccination in Times of Pandemic Citation: Castillo Nicolas . \"The Importance of Vaccination in Times of Pandemic\". Acta Scientific Biotechnology 3.5 (2022): 09-16.actors involved. There are some excellent videos on YouTube, for example Side Effects of Vaccines: What's the Risk? and Inside the lab that invented the COVID-19 vaccine. The official page of the WHO has many animations and tips for raising awareness on social network s; https://who.canto.global/s/HVD3V?viewIndex=0&fro m=fitView&display=curatedView Social networks allow us to work a powerful channel of social interaction, to achieve a dynamic exchange between people, groups and institutions in complex contexts. Our intervention through this virtual communication tool opens up a communication platform for us in the permanent construction of messages and concepts that strengthen the positioning of those that involve social groups that identify with the same needs and problems and that are orga - nized to enhance their resources. Information about the uses, benefits, and limitations of social networks for health communication among the general public, pa - tients, and professionals regarding vaccines is still limited. Despite the fact that networks such as Facebook or Twitter are widely used communication tools, data recently obtained in our country show how it is still one of the least used channels among Internet us - ers when it comes to obtaining information on health issues. Social networks are currently also used by groups that are resistant to vaccines, where the emotional impact is such that it ensures great media visibility for anti-vaccine arguments, helping to expand the area of the so-called undecided, that is, people who refuse vaccina - tions or are unsure. Media The media have an impact on collective and individual health, and are essential to shape beliefs and behaviors. Currently the - re are thousands of mass media, the technological and computer revolution allows thousands of hours of videos to be uploaded to the internet every hour, a new blog is created every minute, it seems that access and the possibility of producing information is multiplied and democratized, however, the sheer concentration of media ownership is alarming and makes the uniformity of content overwhelming. Indeed, thousands of these media are in the hands of a few people and their concentration is increasing. In the health sector, the mass media play a very important role, and the corpo - rations-media-governments triad continues. Media content cre - ates and consolidates behaviors, beliefs and values, many of whi - ch are aimed at creating individualistic, violent, competitive and over-consuming beings. The media assume the media messages that are going to influence, to a lesser or greater degree, in adop - ting certain attitudes and behaviors, collective and individual, for this reason it is very important to spread messages of awareness and sensitization about vaccination in various media through of all possible platforms so that your message is massive. Due to their relevance and scope, social networks can be excel - lent allies if handled properly: Appoint a person responsible for its management, who has the criteria to identify critical knots or strengths for the ins - titution. Closely follow the news on the networks and key influencers. Monitor the conversation about vaccines and vaccination. Prepare a social network plan that includes what messages will be broadcast and their daily frequency. For example, in the first week, broadcast informative messages three times a day: what is the benefit of vaccines, where to go to get vacci - nated and care that must be considered. Identify allies and opponents. Monitor their accounts, what they post, the reach of their messages, and measure their im - pact. Define what actions must be taken in each case. Take advantage of the opportunity offered by social networks to dialogue with the population, answering their questions and clarifying doubts. New models of communicating in health It is necessary to understand, as we have pointed out before, that communication transcends what we know as the mass media (press, radio and TV), and a good prevention or health promo - tion campaign can be much more effective if it has constant contact with the population we want to reach. For this reason, it is not only necessary to emphasize communication programs from health centers, but also to structure communication campaigns that pri - oritize the aspect of participation of society and direct contact. The proliferation of community radio and television stations is striking, which, in addition to confronting hegemonic thought, have been promoting values and principles different from those that domi - nate capitalist society. These media can be an important tool for health promotion and for confronting harmful and harmful behav - iors and habits. These initiatives force us to rethink the communi - cation model. This implies incorporating people and communities 13The Importance of Vaccination in Times of Pandemic Citation: Castillo Nicolas . \"The Importance of Vaccination in Times of Pandemic\". Acta Scientific Biotechnology 3.5 (2022): 09-16.as active subjects in this process. It is essential to understand the need for a new development and consumption model, different from the one promoted by the mass media controlled by big capi - tal. It is necessary to promote a reflection that allows us to build new communication models, more democratic and participatory, which will surely have a better impact on the life and health of the population.

It is necessary to promote a reflection that allows us to build new communication models, more democratic and participatory, which will surely have a better impact on the life and health of the population. The importance of the message The objective is that the person who sends the message trans - mits it in a clear, transparent and direct way, without there being any room for confusion, misunderstanding or erroneous interpre - tation. Identify two to three key messages to communicate. Citizens do not retain much information and the central messages may be diluted. Avoid talking more than necessary. It is advisable to direct messages to audiences that are will - ing to be vaccinated and need to be informed, as well as to convince those who are undecided. Avoid wasting energy on those who won't change their minds. Avoid getting into fruitless public discussions. You have to respond with data, validated information and evidence, and based on clear ideas. Be more proactive than reactive. Use a language according to the audiences. Learn the idioms, slang and others that allow a connection with the public. Speak with empathy, recognizing that the population may have questions or doubts. Do not minimize the concerns of the audience. Every question serves to clarify or repeat concepts or information that may not have been completely clear. Work on the emotional aspects of the audience, such as the perception of risk and contagion, distrust in vaccines and in the system, regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry, fear, uncertainty, concern, expectations, anger and frustration, among others. Generate a simple and easy dia - logue with citizens, respond to their concerns, reduce the - ir fear and increase adherence to vaccines and vaccination. Answer questions such as do we know if vaccines are safe and effective? What will the vaccination process be like? Where and when should I get vaccinated? If I get vaccinated, will I no longer be infected? If I am vaccinated, should I aban - don protective measures such as wearing a mask, hand was - hing and physical distance? Why are there priority groups? Do vaccines have side effects? Use clear and simple speech. Explain the technical aspects surrounding the vaccine in a simple way. Increase their discursive scope around security and make peop - le's fears or concerns their own. Show empathy. Put the information in context. Communication about vac - cines and vaccination cannot be done in isolation, it is part of a comprehensive policy. Show that vaccines and vaccina - tion against COVID-19 are part of a broader public health strategy. It must be connected with the reality of the people and the vaccination plan of the countries and how this has contributed to the health of the population. Show successful examples of other vaccination processes. Add the responsibility of the vaccination process to the fami - lies and the community. Appeal to what has been lived. \"We are all in this together\". \"Getting vaccinated is taking care of yourself and taking care of others, and one more step to con - trol the pandemic\". Prepare a media plan. This allows installing the thematic agenda in public opinion. Manage interviews, offer reports, publish opinion columns. Appoint a person to be in charge of press management (calling the media and offering topics). Have a good team and writers to develop the content. Plan the spokespersons that will be part of that plan. Storytelling for the vaccine When getting vaccinated is a voluntary option and people need to be quickly convinced to do so, it is essential to build stories that give confidence. Especially to motivate \"pioneers\" and \"early adopt -14The Importance of Vaccination in Times of Pandemic Citation: Castillo Nicolas . \"The Importance of Vaccination in Times of Pandemic\". Acta Scientific Biotechnology 3.5 (2022): 09-16.ers\" to try. But then, in everyone's interest, we must facilitate com - munication between these two groups and those who have mis - givings. And, in this, I think that we all play a critical role: political authorities, scientists, the media and vaccine producers. But also you and me, as citizens. When the authorities, the scientific community and the media spread success stories and normalize the image of the vaccine, they do a great job. Manufacturers who present favorable and certified results of their products also do well. The truth is that in many democratic countries vaccination is not compulsory, so for the campaign to be effective, people must want to be vaccinated. And the less time we take to convince ourselves, the faster we will reach the \"herd immunity\". So what can we do to combat the fear and rejection of these people? The answer to the question has to do with an already classic theory and with social storytelling. Roger's theory. In 1962, he pub - lished a theory that went around the world: that of the \"Diffusion of Innovations\". It goes something like this: whenever an innovation appears in a society of well-connected people, five attitudes can be expected to manifest successively and over time. These are: That of innovative or pioneering people. They are the ones who, without hesitation, will adopt the innovation the min - ute it is available. The one of the first followers. They are the group of those who could not be pioneers, but who will immediately accept that they can. That of the precocious majority. A massive group waiting to see how innovation goes for the previous two groups. The late majority. Another massive group, but reticent (or without access) to innovation. The one of the laggards. People who will not accept innova - tion for fear of change or mistrust. Addressing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation Despite the wide public acceptance of vaccines, anti-vaccine ac - tivists have tried to undermine vaccines since their invention more than 200 years ago. Though rarely prevalent, when anti-vaccine ac - tivists find a temporary traction in a society, vaccination rates can drop, and preventable diseases rise. Misinformation related to an - ti-vaccination is characterized by flaws in reasoning and fallacies, and often by belief in conspiracy theories. Therefore, it is important to protect the public against misinfor - mation and anti-vaccine propaganda. Here are some key steps to keep in mind when dealing with disinformation: Determine if misinformation is gaining ground. Before spen - ding time and resources to address specific misinformation, it is important to know if it is actually having an impact or is likely to have an impact. Remember that every time you tackle disinformation, you are talking about someone else's agenda, not your own. Protecting against disinformation: \"Prebunking\" or inocu - lation Since disinformation can spread quickly and far, it is best that people are prepared for it. This can be achieved by explaining deceptive or manipulative argumentation strategies to people, a technique known as 'inoculation' or 'prebunking' which makes people resistant to subsequent attempts at manipulation. The inoculation process includes a warning that people may be misled, followed by a pre - emptive refutation of the misleading argument. Inoculation thus follows the biomedical analogy; By exposing people to a weakened dose of the techniques used in disinformation and preemptively refuting them, \"cognitive antibodies\" can be stimulated. Correcting misinformation: How to debunk If the misinfor - mation has already caught on, the next option is to debunk it. Debunking can be challenging because even though cor - rections appear to reduce people's belief in misinformation, misinformation often still influences people's thinking. De - bunking or correcting misinformation based on best practic - es and recommendations has been shown to be effective in combating vaccine-related misinformation, although vaccine misinformation can be expected to be resistant to correc - tions. may conflict with people's emotions and moral values. Information monitoring Information monitoring is key throughout the emergency pro - cess and the implementation of the strategy. It allows to identify rumors and false or inaccurate information, design messages ap - propriate to the needs of different audiences and detect unexpe - cted events early, among others. For these purposes you can use:15The Importance of Vaccination in Times of Pandemic Citation: Castillo Nicolas . \"The Importance of Vaccination in Times of Pandemic\". Acta Scientific Biotechnology 3.5 (2022): 09-16. Reports from call centers: Request a daily report with the main queries. Use it to close disinformation gaps. Incorpo - rate these needs in the messages that the authorities issue the next day. Vaccination follow-up reports: Analyze how vaccination coverage is going and the causes of what is happening. For example, if coverage in certain groups is low, incorporate messages calling for vaccination and clearing up any doubts that may exist. Social networks: Use daily or weekly metrics to analyze the main issues that have been addressed at the national level and, in particular, in the institution's networks. Build mes - sages with graphic support materials such as GIFs, videos, cards or others to address them through that same channel and close the gap. Consider how to respond to anti-vaccine groups or in - dividuals: For example, in the face of statements such as \"vaccines don't work\", consider taking charge of the respon - se indirectly, avoiding confrontation, with information and evidence. Remember to direct people to the official website for more information. Observe what is happening in other countries: This will allow you to have additional information to handle possible critical knots that have to be faced. Monitoring and evaluation of the strategy Monitoring and evaluation is key to learning, adapting and gui - ding communication. Monitor the activities included in the strate - gy, the team and the communication process with the population and its impact. Plan moments of evaluation of the strategy (short, medium and long term) based on the established objectives. Analyze if the strategy runs along the desired line. If not, ad - just it to the stage. Document good practices, which allow risks to be reduced and constitute learning for future experiences. Conclusion As a conclusion of this applied work, we distinguish the high percentage of vaccinated people who have developed high levels of protection and followed the proposed scheme. With this situation, there was better control of subsequent outbreaks and a lower rate of severity in infected patients.
