Spring/Summer 2008 SCRIPPS NAMED TO FORTUNE\u00ae M A G A Z I N E ' S N A T I O N A L \"100 Best Companies to Work For\" Corporate Senior Vice PresidentChief Development Officer 3giving with great returns Scripps Cancer Care Dear Friends, Like mother, Like daughter 4Sue Hopkins and her daughter, Patti, have long had the type of close relationship that often manifests itself in surprising and almost uncanny ways. They finish each other's sentences. They show up at dinners and events and discover they're wearing nearly the same outfits. On August 1, 2007, they were both diagnosed with breast cancer. Three weeks later, they both checked into Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla for surgery. LAST SUMMER, SUE FELT SOMETHING UNUSUAL IN HER BREAST. It was just days before her annual check-up with Cheryl Olson, M.D., a Scripps La Jolla surgeon who had been doing Sue's annual follow-up exams since she'd been diagnosed with a benign breast growth several years earlier. This time around, though,Dr. Olson didn't believe the growth was benign. She scheduled an ultrasound and biopsy for the following day. Patti accompanied her mother to Dr. Olson's office for the procedures. \"I told Mom I was going to give her moral support, and she told me I didn't need to come, that she'd be fine. She can really be stubborn!\" Patti says, with a laugh. It's a good thing Patti didn't let Sue dissuade her. As Dr. Olson was performing Sue's biopsy, Patti mentioned to the surgeon that she'd noticed a dimple on her own breast. Both Patti and Sue say laughter, friendship and the high quality care they receive at Scripps gives them strength through their cancer diagnoses and treatments.5\"I was in the middle of doing her mother's biopsy, and Patti pulled up her shirt and showed me the dimple,\" says Dr. Olson. \"She said, 'What do you think about this?'\" Dr. Olson thought it deserved a closer look. She immediately sent Patti for an ultrasound. Both mother and daughter learned they had cancer that afternoon, and both were scheduled for surgery August 21. D R . O L S O N H A D S E E N C A N C E R RUN IN FAMILIES BEFORE. She'd treated grandmothers, their daughters, and their granddaughters. But she'd never performed surgery on a mother and daughter on the same day. \"Dr. Olson was a busy lady that morning,\" Patti recalls. \"I guess we owe her an apology. She certainly deserves an award!\" While both women were diagnosed with early-stage cancer that was ductal in origin, the similarities stopped there. Sue, 71, had non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), in which abnormal cells multiply and form a growth within a milk duct of the breast. Although the cancer was non-invasive, much of her breast was affected, and Sue and her doctors felt the best treatment was a mastectomy. In addition to removing all of the cancerous tissue, a mastectomy would allow Sue to avoid radiation. Sue also has scleroderma, an autoimmune disease of the connective tissues, so her radiation oncologist, Jean Mefferd, M.D., felt that radiation could potentially compromise her lung tissue. Dr. Olson performed the surgery; immediately after, Scripps La Jolla plastic surgeon Michael Brucker, M.D., began the breast reconstruction process. Sue is now classified as a Stage 0 and is taking tamoxifen for maintenance. Her prognosis is excellent. Patti's cancer, although early-stage like her mother's, was invasive. The tumor was low and in the middle of her chest; because of its location, it hadn't been detected on a mammogram that Patti, 44, had done just a few months earlier. As the tumor grew, it pulled on ligaments and changed the contour of her breast, causing an indentation in the tissue. If Patti hadn't mentioned the \"dimple\" on her breast to Dr. Olson, her cancer may have gone undetected for months. The fact that Patti's cancer was invasive, coupled with her age, warranted a different approach to treatment. Dr. Olson performed a lumpectomy and was able to save Patti's breast. Chemotherapy and radiation followed. Even though Patti's lymph nodes and the margins around her tumor were clear, studies have shown that pre-menopausal women Patti's age who have invasive breast cancer fare better if they get chemotherapy. Patti began chemotherapy several days after her surgery and completed it in January of this year. In February, she began radiation treatment with Dr. Mefferd, and her prognosis is promising.S U E A N D P A T T I H AV E B O T H B E E N SCRIPPS PATIENTS FOR DECADES. So when they learned they had cancer, they trusted Scripps to provide the care they needed. \"Dr. Olson spearheaded everything,\" Patti says. \"We talked to her about an oncologist. She recommended two plastic surgeons. She just took care of it. She's great, and we are crazy about her.\" The women are also very good friends with retired Scripps physician John Trombold, M.D. As past director of the Scripps Cancer Center, Stevens Division, Dr. Trombold was an excellent resource and provided a great deal of support. \"I feel very lucky to have had such wonderful and talented physicians, and to be able to have Scripps available for my health care,\" Sue says. Other than an elderly aunt on her father's side, there is no history of breast cancer in the Hopkins family. Dr. Olson believes there is a definite genetic link between the women's cases, but because Sue and Patti did not have genetic testing for breast cancer gene abnormalities, they don't know exactly what it is. Sue's other daughter has shown no signs of developing the disease. Patti has a 20-year-old daughter; and to be cautious, she plans for her to have annual mammograms and look into genetic testing. \"She's a carbon copy of me,\" Patti says, \"So I want to make sure she is tested.\" Sue Hopkins (left) and daughter, Patti, have a close bond. Both were diagnosed and treated for breast cancer this past year. Both Patti and Sue say laughter, friendship and the high quality care they receive at Scripps gives them strength through their cancer diagnoses and treatments.6Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer treated by Scripps physicians. According to the most recent cancer registry data, Scripps cared for more than 700 breast cancer patients last year. These patients represent 23 percent of all Scripps cancer cases. In May 2007, Scripps formed the Breast Cancer Quality Task Force to evaluate breast cancer patients outcomes with a goal of improving both the programs and quality of care patients receive. Co-chaired by Scripps surgical oncologist Paul Goldfarb,M.D., and advanced practice nurse Aran Levine, R.N., the task force is a multidisciplinary group of physicians from allfive Scripps hospitals, including pathologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, radiologists and surgeons. \"Our goal is to optimize the care women receive throughout the Scripps system and make sure the care they get is best forthe disease they have,\" explains Dr. Goldfarb. \"When you have a systemwide network, any patient at any hospital should get the same level of care and the same access to clinical trials and studies.\" Among the task force's objectives: Establish quality outcome measures for breast cancer care throughout Scripps Evaluate data and develop plans to meet benchmarks set by task force membership Promote the quality of care for breast cancer patients by implementing quality improvement Educate physicians and patients regarding appropriate evidence-based care for breast cancer Re-evaluate data to assure benchmarks are being achieved \"It is awe-inspiring to see so many physicians from so many specialties collaborating to help care for breast cancer patients,\" says Levine. \"The entire group is focused on finding the best care and putting it into practice.\"Improving Care for Breast Cancer Patients s c r i p p s c a n c e r c e n t e r b r e a s t c a n c e r quality task force Do Jerman (pronounced Doe) enjoys swing dancing, working out with a personal trainer and playing golf. She is also part of an exclusive club: the well elderly (wellderly). Though 81 years old, Do has no significant chronic medical conditions, which gives her longevity particular significance. Researchers at Scripps Genomic Medicine want to know more about what keeps her so healthy. You might think Jerman simply has good genes. In other words, she lacks the genes that could make her susceptible to conditions like cancer or heart disease. But researchers have learned that the well elderly often have a similar profile of disease-producing genes but, for some reason, still don't get sick. If you are wondering why that is, so is Eric Topol, M.D., director of Scripps Translational Science Institute and Scripps Genomics Medicine. Dr. Topol has initiated the Wellderly study to answer that question. \"Everybody has bad genes, that is what's fascinating. But why do these people who harbor bad genes do so well?\" asks Dr. Topol. \"We need to find the mechanisms that keep them healthy, and we know these are lurking in the genome. We know there are 'modifier genes' that cancel out the risk of disease genes, but little work has been done so far in human beings. We're going to find these genes that protect from disease - they are really nature's secrets.\"Do, who is a Scripps donor and volunteer, attended a presentation by Dr. Topol and was so impressed by his work and the goals of the genomics program that she quickly decided to participate. \"Dr. Topol said he was looking for 80-year-olds on no medication to put in his gene pool. And I thought, here I am,\" says Do. \"I wanted to do whatever I could to help.\" Dr. Topol's team needs around 1,000 healthy volunteers age 80 or older to donate their DNA through a one-time blood donation. Through the study, researchers hope to determine what protectsthe healthy elderly from their \"bad\" genes - and help develop future medical treatments or even cures.

Little did they know that nearly 18 years later, their gift would support the medical care that saved Norm's life. \"We just celebrated our 56th wedding anniversary, and thanks to Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas, we look forward to celebrating many more,\" Norm says. More than a year ago, Norm received a devastating diagnosis- kidney cancer. Confident in the medical care at Scripps Encinitas, he consulted with urologist Edward Cohen, M.D., and family medicine physician Robert Brunst, M.D., to discuss possible treatments. The best option was to remove one of Norm's kidneys. \"Without hesitation, I asked 'When do we get started,'\" says Norm.Over a year later, Norm proudly reports that his check-ups show no signs of cancer. \"I owe my life to the doctors at Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas,\" says Norm, the emotion evident as his eyes well up with tears. \"Thanks to their persistence and diligence, they were able to diagnose my cancer early, even without major symptoms. I feel so lucky to be alive.\" Norm also recognizes the role that philanthropy played in his medical care. His cancer was detected by high resolution imaging from the advanced 64-slice CT scanner, which was funded with community support and gifts from donors like him. Understanding firsthand how philanthropy directly impacts patient care, Norm encourages others to give. \"Everyone in the community will likely need medical care at some point during their lives,\" says Norm. \"What better way to invest in your health, than to invest in the future of your hospital - Scripps.\" Norm and Marty HalusDoug Barnhart Makes $2.5 Million Gift to Scripps Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery Program As founder and CEO of Douglas E. Barnhart, Inc., a San Diego building, engineering and construction management firm, Doug Barnhart understands the importance of using the latest technology to get the best results. As an engineer and a lifetime golfer, he recognizes that precision, expertise and years of experience are critical to achieving success. These same guiding principles also influenced Mr. Barnhart as a patient facing prostate cancer and as an individual who wanted to make a positive impact on the health of his community. Doug Barnhart returns to the golf course, only one month after undergoing minimally invasive robot-assisted surgery at Scripps Mercy Hospital to treat his prostate cancer. Honoring the compassionate care he received, Mr. Barnhart recently made an extraordinary $2.5 million matching gift to support the development of two,state-of-the-art minimally invasive surgical suites. On the right course9Doug Barnhart Makes $2.5 Million Gift to Scripps Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery Program Upon learning of his cancer diagnosis, Mr. Barnhart researched his options and chose the Scripps Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery Program and its state-of-the-art da Vinci \u00ae Surgical System for his prostate surgery. \"The da Vinci\u00ae Surgical System is a marvelous piece of engineering machinery,\" Mr. Barnhart says. \"All other surgical options were out of the question. I wanted to go with the best.\" Unlike traditional open surgery that often requires long incisions and invasive tissue disruption, robot-assisted surgery is performed through tiny incisions of one totwo centimeters and with minimal impact to the surrounding area. The da Vinci \u00ae provides surgeons with enhanced dexterity, precision and control, offering greater range of motion than the human hand and wrist. As a result, patients typically experience less blood loss, less risk of infection, less pain and scarring, and a quicker recovery.Reflecting these positive outcomes, Mr. Barnhart's surgery was a great success. His recovery was better and easier than he had ever imagined. Within only a month, he was running and playing 18 holes of golf. \"I quickly returned to doing the sport activities that I enjoy and feel like I've been given a second chance at life,\" says Mr. Barnhart. Overcoming his diagnosis, especially given its severity, Mr. Barnhart has a new perspective on life, his purpose and his goal to help others. Inspired by the compassionate and exceptional surgical care he received from Carol Salem, M.D., medical director of the Scripps Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery Program, her surgical team, and urologist John Martin, M.D., he decided to make a $2.5 million gift to Scripps Mercy Hospital. It will support the significant renovation of two operating rooms to accommodate minimally invasive surgery equipment- the same equipment that was a critical factor in his extraordinary surgical outcome. \"I'm excited to support Scripps Mercy Hospital and ensure this revolutionary medical technology is available to other patients like me,\" says Mr. Barnhart. With Mr. Barnhart's gift - and support from the community - two, state-of-the-art minimally invasive surgical suites will provide the technology and space for surgeons throughout the Scripps health care system to perform minimally invasive robotic surgeries, including urologic and gynecologic procedures. The new operating rooms will also be equipped with advanced video conferencing capabilities to teach surgeons and medical specialists about the benefits of lifesaving, robot-assisted surgical procedures. \"The new operating rooms will provide an incredible way to teach. An audience of medical specialists will be able to watch robot-assisted surgeries live from a conference room,\" says Dr. Salem. \"The video capabilities are absolutely phenomenal.\" Mr. Barnhart's generous $2.5 million gift will be used as a challenge to the community to help raise $5 million needed to develop the minimally invasive surgical suites. The renovation is part of Scripps Mercy's larger plan to expand and modernize key critical care facilities that help the hospital serve the health care needs of more than one million people. \"I quickly returned to doing the sport activites that I enjoy and feel like I've been given a second chance at life,\" says Doug Barnhart.10The room is quiet, except for the scratching of pens on paper and the occasional tissue being pulled from its package. The writers, all cancer patients, are responding to the prompt: Talk back to your cancer. It is something they are eager to do. Some scribble fiercely, while others are more measured. You can see their disappointment when the group's facilitator calls time. She asks if anyone would like to read and, one by one, they open up. How long were you hiding in there, like a child playing hide and seek? How could you have kept so still, held your breath for so long, silently growing bigger and stronger inside my unsuspecting self? The pieces are as individual as the people writing them. Some take their cancer to task, use insulting language or simply talk down to it. Others take a compassionate, almost maternal, approach. Where did we go wrong? Despite these differences in tone, the writers share a common thread \u2014 catharsis. The words pour out as participants write about their cancer.Rosemary Brinig, Luisa Peck, Lydia Morales Hoffman and Patricia Brennan listen carefully. When WordsHeal the art of renewalAfter months, or years, of uncertainty, painful treatments and the gnawing fear of relapse, they embrace the opportunity to write it out. A Chapter \"When Words Heal\" is an eight-week workshop designed to help participants express the complex emotions that arrive with cancer. But for Sharon Bray, Ed.D., a writer, teacher and breast cancer survivor who facilitates the group, the goals of the workshop are less about cancer than they are about life. \"It starts out the people are very raw, angry. They want to beat up cancer,\" says Dr. Bray. \"But gradually it changes, the stories of cancer begin to recede and stories from life take over. My goal is to get people to realize that cancer is a chapter, not a whole life.\" The workshop allows people to find an artistic outlet for their hope, fear and anger, but it also provides clinical benefits. A number of studies have shown that people who express their emotions about cancer, rather than bottling them up, reap tangible health benefits, such as fewer medical appointments for problems related to cancer and its treatment.In Demand Tom Friedman, L.C.S.W., a social worker at Scripps Cancer Center, helped bring Dr. Bray to Scripps, and would like to expand the program. \"She has remarkable skills as a facilitator and sensitivity to issues associated with living with a cancer diagnosis,\" says Friedman. He notes that the workshop has developed quite a following. \"As soon as each series is over, we get calls asking when the next one will start.\" \"When Words Heal\" is supported through a generous grant from OSI Pharmaceuticals. 11 Rosemary Brinig, Luisa Peck, Lydia Morales Hoffman and Patricia Brennan listen carefully.Members wear bracelets like a badge of honor. Carol Seidenwurm shares her story. Sharon Bray, Ed.D., facilitates an eight-week journaling workshop for patients living with cancer.12A picture is worth a thousand words, especially when it comes to images taken by a new 64-slice CT scanner. The advanced technology provides sharp, three- dimensional images of any organ within seconds. Its clarity and speed enables physicians to make faster, more precise diagnoses.Dedicated to patient care, Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista is seeking community support to offer the new CT scanner to San Diego and South Bay communities. \"Comparing our current 16-slice CT scanner to the 64-slice CT is like comparing regular and digital TV,\" says John McHargue, manager of imaging services at Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista. \"Both display an image, but the 64-slice CT amplifies minute details, making it crystal clear.\"From oncology and cardiology to pediatric and emergency care, the 64-slice CT scanner offers a broad range of capabilities. For example, a virtual endoscopy of the colon can be done to detect cancer polyps. The patient swallows a pill containing a microscopic camera that travels through the body, capturing detailed images from various angles. This procedure is far less invasive and a more comfortable alternative to conventional endoscopy procedures.Images captured by the 64-slice CT scanner can also be reformatted to reflect three-dimensional models. This is extremely valuable in helping physicians examine cancer tumors to precisely track growth and treatment. \"The 64-slice CT scanner is one of the most important advances in radiology,\" John says. \"In an instant, it gives the physician a comprehensive, close-up view of what's happening inside the body. It's what I'd want my doctor to use.\" Getting The Big Picture A 64-slice CT scanner magnifies images of any organ within seconds to help physicians assess patient health with extremely high accuracy.For months after fire raged through her area of Ramona in October 2003, Chris Kennedy had a pesky cough. She figured it must be from the smoke and residue from the tragic fires. By the next summer, when the cough just wouldn't let up, she finally went to a doctor and received unimaginable news. Although never a smoker, Chris was diagnosed with lung cancer - one of the most life-threatening cancers. Within a month, the bottom lobe of her right lung was removed, and she was undergoing chemotherapy. To support her treatment, she saw David Leopold, M.D., director of integrative medical education at Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine, who works with patients to develop individual care plans for improving their mind-body health during treatment. Chris received acupuncture along with her chemotherapy, and learned about stress reduction, nutrition and exercise - along with holistic approaches including meditation. \"I was very pleased when my lung scans came back all clear. Suddenly I was getting better,\" says Chris. \"We believe in empowering the patient to learn how to deal with stress,\" says Dr. Leopold. \"We teach methods so people can manage their stress through meditation and yoga.\"Dr. Leopold also teaches that the body needs nourishing foods while it is repairing damaged tissue. Beside organic meats, vegetable and fruits, other foods have specific healing properties, including turmeric, berries, fish oils, broccoli and green teas, he adds. Chris is still on the road to recovery, after having been diagnosed with a tumor on the other lung 18 months after her first diagnosis. Through everything she learned at Scripps, she's optimistic about her future and attributes her health especially to Dr. Leopold's use of regular acupuncture treatments.patients thrive through integrative approach13SWEET TASTE OF SUCCESS When Burke Campbell was undergoing treatments for advanced tongue cancer, he concentrated on the love and support of his wife and two children, and the good times they shared. While a revolutionary type of radiation treatment was focusing on his cancer, he focused on keeping a positive attitude. With his wife, Andrea, and two children, Audrey and Burke III, by his side, he beat the cancer and was back to work in eight weeks. \"This new therapy delivers the radiation from seven or eight angles with modulating intensity, minimizing the damage to other areas near his tongue,\" says Prabhakar Tripuraneni, M.D., chief of staff, and head of the division of radiation oncology at Scripps Green Hospital. \"This precise beam, along with a medication that protects the salivary glands, helped save his teeth, taste buds and other vital functions. It's highly successful.\" \"But it's more than just the technology,\" adds Dr. Tripuraneni. \"When we start to treat a new patient, I tell them that we - the whole team in radiation oncology including nurses, therapists and others who care from him - will be partners for the next two months, and that to be cured, they need to fully participate in their recovery. After that, it becomes a life-long relationship of following periodically to detect any potential harmful effects of radiation and to minimize them and other aspects.\" According to Dr. Tripuraneni, that partnership is firmly grounded in his philosophy of not just treating cancer, but treating people with cancer. Having a close relationship with the patient, while delivering innovative therapies using leading-edge technology and the best supportive care from the radiation oncology team, results in more effective cures. \"The week after I was diagnosed, we switched our medical care to Scripps because I knew I'd get the best care,\" says Burke, who is a computer network administrator by day and a Renaissance fighter on the weekends. \"The nurses are angels who put up with my complaints and concerns, while guiding me through my two months of treatment, and ultimately, my cure. Dr. Tripuraneni is great; actually, more than great, he saved my life.\" Because of this new technology and their staff's guidance, I grew stronger and realized that if I could get over this, I could get over anything. Y ou only fail when you give up, and because of Scripps, I prevailed and look forward to a long life with my family.\" \"Burke Campbell with children, Audrey and Burke III14Renaissance Ball Benefits Scripps Clinic and Scripps Green Hospital The stars were aligned for Scripps Clinic and Scripps Green Hospital's Renaissance Ball VI, Imagine , held in March 2008. Proceeds from the ball contributed to the $1.4 million the event has raised during the past six years to benefit Scripps Clinic and Scripps Green Hospital .Through Betty Knight Scripps' continued leadership as Candlelight Ball's Gener al Chairman, the exclusive event has raised $13 million in philanthropic support during the past five years to further the lifesaving care at Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla. CELEBRATING THE SEASON by candlelight Known for her generosity and philanthropic spirit, Betty Knight Scripps continued her family's legacy of giving back to the community at the 78th Annual Candlelight Ball,in December 2007. Serving as General Chairman of the ball for the fifth consecutive year, Mrs. Scripps contributed an unprecedented $1.5 million challenge grant, helping raise a record-breaking $3.5 million to further the lifesaving care at Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla. As the highlight of the evening, honorary chair Audrey S. Geisel, pictured with Alex Butterfield, is recognized for her ongoing support of Scripps with a special star named in her honor. The Audrey S. Geisel star shines in the sky's Southern Hemisphere. Raising a record-breaking $1 million, the 38th Annual Mercy Ball, April in Paris, entertained guests with the elegance and opulence of the famous French city. The black-tie event, held in April 2008, honored Conrad T. Prebys for his continued support of critical care services at Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego and Chula Vista.

So when his company stock was returning less than one percent a year, he analyzed what was best for his investments. That's when he and his wife, Sophia, created a charitable remainder annuity trust through the Scripps Health Foundation Office of Gift Planning, allowing them to make a sizeable charitable gift of stock to Scripps, while providing them significant tax and income benefits. \"That solution was the best of both worlds for us,\" says Stephen, who at 86 enjoys spending time on his computers, cell phone and ham radio equipment. \"We receive an annual fixed income paid monthly and didn't have to worry about capital gains tax. We were also able to support a wonderful institution such as Scripps.\" The Levys first became acquainted with Scripps more than 40 years ago when Stephen needed medical assistance while the couple was in town from Phoenix. They've been receiving their care from Scripps ever since, and rave about their experiences. They're proud to give back through their charitable remainder annuity trust. A charitable remainder annuity trust, like what the Levys have, is best suited for irrevocable transfers of cash and appreciated publicly traded securities. After the initial transfer into the trust, no future additions can be made. The annuity is paid out monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually, based on the donor's preference. There are other types of charitable remainder trusts that might be more appropriate for other situations. Donors who want to use real estate to fund a trust will use a charitable remainder unitrust. Future additions can be made to a unitrust. No matter which type of trust, when it terminates, the remaining assets are transferred to Scripps. Stephen has served on community advisory boards for both orthopedics and cardiology at Scripps Clinic. He and Sophia have always been very satisfied with the care they receive at Scripps, and believe it's the people at Scripps who make the difference. The Levys are pleased to leave a legacy that will help others for years to come. \"The community needs Scripps because it's unique,\" says Stephen. \"The physicians and staff in the different specialties work so well together. There's a sense of personal ownership among the staff, making us feel they really care. That's a great part of why we have stayed with Scripps, and why we give back.\" For more information on charitable remainder annuity trusts and other life income gifts, contact the Scripps Health Foundation Office of Gift Planning at 800-326-3776 or visit www.scrippsheritage.org.
