Introduction 1. The Government has announc ed that the functions cu rrently carried out by the Qualifications and Curriculum Developm ent Agency (QCDA) should be discharged differently. On 27 May 2010, t he Secretary of Stat e wrote to the Chair of QCDA to confirm the intention to introduce legislat ion (the Education Bill 2011) to abolish the QCDA, subject to the will of Parliament, by March 2012. The Education Bill was introduced in to the House of Commons on 26 January 2011, and is expected to receive Royal Assent in Autumn 2011. 2. Ministers made it clear that not all functions currently carr ied out by QCDA will cease. They indicated t hat statutory assessment and National Curriculum Tests (NCTs) would continue to be developed and delivered. There wa s, therefore, a need for the orderly transfer of functions and people supporting NCTs and statutory assessment to new deliv ery arrangements. 3. In order to deliver statut ory assessment and testing in fu ture, the Secretary of State signalled his intention to establish a new Executive Agency, the Standards and Testing Agency (STA), within the Depar tment for Education (DfE) - with the expected benefits of: A smaller, more focused and more efficient body responsible for developing statutory assessment and test ing, that is more di rectly accountable to Ministers; and Ministers having a closer line of sight on test delivery issues, as well as a greater synergy between poli cy development and delivery. 4. The remit and purpose of the new Agen cy will be to develop and deliver statutory assessment and testing for children up to age 14 (the end of Key Stage 3). This will include the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (EYSFP), statutory teacher assessments at Key Stages 1, 2 and 3, as well as the Year 1 phonics check and NCTs at Key Stage 2. A full list of the STA' s remit and functions is set out in Annex 1. The recommendations from Lord Bew's external review of Key Stage 2 testing, assessment and accountability (published in June 2011 and accepted in full by Ministers in July 2011) will be implemented by the Agency. 2. Strategic Case 5. The Department considered several options for the delivery of statutory assessment and testing, including maintaining the 's tatus quo' and transferring these functions to a directorate within the Department. The preferred option was to establish a new Executive Agency within the Department that would take on responsibility for statutory assessment and testi ng from QCDA. Its main objective is to provide an effective and robust testing and assessment system that objectively measures and monitors pupil progress from the early years up to the end of Key Stage 3. 6. The Executive Agency model fulfils the requirements of the Go vernment in that statutory assessment and test ing functions need to be conducted at a national level with proper accountability through Ministers. Given the critic al part that NCTs play in the accountability system, both at school level and at national level, with the Department's own performance in relation to primary educatio n measured through test outcomes, it is essential that the Agency is able to demonstrate independence in key areas, specifically signing off t he content of NCTs and the level-setting process (that is, the process through wh ich pass marks are set). This can be achieved through: Executive Agency status; defining these responsibilities with in the Agency framework document; ensuring that the CEO as Accounting Officer has more autonomy than would be the case if he were operating wit hin a Departmental Directorate. 7. The fact that these functions will continue to be regulated by Ofqual, the independent regulator, provides further assurance of in dependence in these areas. The Bew Review 8. In 2010, the Secretary of State commissi oned Lord Bew to lead an external Review of the testing and account ability system for primary schools in England. The Review, which reported its findings in June 2011, recommended substantial improvements to the cu rrent system. The Gove rnment accepted its recommendations in full in July 2011, with a commitment to implement the recommendations as quickly as is practic able. Changes to the system as a result are summarised at Annex 2. In addition, the EYFSP has been reviewed and the National Curriculum is currently under re view. Some changes in the way children are assessed are therefore likely. 9. The remit of the Agency reflects the current priorities of the Government as set out in these reviews. Further work is under way to consider how detailed changes will be delivered and future implic ations for the Agency. 3. Economic Case 10. Delivering the current pr ogramme of statutory assessm ent and testing through an arm's length delivery model is considered inefficient and less effective. In particular, as a Non Departmental Public Body ( NDPB) QCDA delivered its own corporate services. There are economies of scale to be gained from merging those functions (such as HR, Communications, Finance and IT) with those in the Department to create a single shared services approach fo r all proposed DfE Executive Agencies, including the STA. 11. This business case considers three options: 'Do Nothing' - leave QCDA in its current form; Abolish QCDA and set-up a new Executive Agency - the STA; 2 Move all statutory assessment and testing functions of QCDA into a Directorate of the DfE. 12. In order to carry out th e analysis of the costs and benefits of the different options it is necessary to identify what would have been spent on STA functions in 2011-12 and later years if they had continued to be delivered through QCDA: For policy delivery functions this is done by identifying which functions would be part of STA. The budgets for these func tions are then summed to give what would have been spent on policy delivery of STA functions had those functions remained within QCDA. For corporate services costs this is not possible because these services cover the whole of the QCDA function. Instead these were apportioned out using the ratio of staff delivering ST A policy functions to total QCDA policy delivery staff. Adding policy delivery function and cor porate services costs together gives an STA baseline from 1 Oct ober 2011 to 31 March 2012 of \u00a37.5m. For the full year of 2012-13 and following years th e baseline will be larger to reflect a full year's costs. Detailed options analysis: 13. This baseline for STA functions delivered within QCDA is used to compare the three different options presented here. Costs and benefits for each option are calculated over a 10 year period, beginning in 2011-12. This is the period used for analysis of one-off policy changes in Regulatory Impac t Assessments. Although the detailed remit is subject to change in the light of the reviews refe rred to earlier, all of the options assume that the broad f unctions will remain the same. Option 1: 'Do Nothing' 14. Under this option QCDA would remain in its current form and continue to deliver statutory assessment and testi ng functions. As the stat us quo is maintained there are no additional costs and benefits associated with this option. As there are no changes to costs and benefits the net present value (NPV) of this option is zero. Net Present Value = 0 15. As will be made clear under option two, choosing this option would mean a number of large benefits are not achieved such as the reductions in corporate costs from moving to shared services with DfE. The Government has been clear that the planned abolition of QCDA is part of its ALB reform programme, with more transparent Ministerial accountability for key national polices such as statutory assessment and testing. Option 2: Establish a new Executive Agency 16. Option two involves setting up a new Exec utive Agency, which wi ll deliver statutory assessment and testing in England. T he Agency will be headed by a CEO, who will be a senior civil servant, and will be directly accountable to the Secretary of State for the successful delivery of the Agency's functions. All statutory assessment and testing delivery work will be taken on by the STA, and QCDA's involvement will 34cease. There are currently 88 posts in the STA at a cost of approximately \u00a35 million per annum. 17.The vast majority of staff coming into the STA will carry out the same functions as they currently do in QCDA so there are no measurable costs or benefits associated with change of function in this option. 18.Table 1 shows the monetised costs and benefits from moving to an Executive Agency model - the STA. These are measured over 10 years. Costs and benefits are measured in real terms and discounted by the standard HMT discount rate of 3.5% to reflect the premium society puts on having money to spend now rather than later. These figures therefore differ in magnitude from the figures in the Finance section - which are in nominal terms and not adjusted for the HMT discount rate. Benefits 19. The benefits in Table 1 are the cost savings from not continuing with providing services through the QCDA. Paragraph 12 shows how the baseline costs from continuing to provide STA services through the QCDA were calculated. Benefits are calculated on a full-year basis for 2012-13 onwards. Costs 20. The costs in Table 1 are administrative costs associated with setting up and running the STA. For 2011-12 the costs cover the last six months and are made up predominantly of costs for statutory assessment and testing staff, shared services corporate staff, redundancy costs1 associated with the closure of QCDA and apportioned nominally to Agency set-up, estates and IT costs2 associated with new systems. Costs rise in later years because they cover the full financial year. However, the rise is not large because many of the costs incurred in 2011-12 are one off redundancy and set-up costs. Table 1 Option 2: Establish a Standards and Testing Executive Agency (\u00a3m) 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-15 to 13.2 12.4 11.7 56.8 101.5 Costs (\u00a3m) 6.5 7.0 6.4 6.0 29.3 55.2 Net Benefits (\u00a3m) 1.1 6.2 6.0 5.6 27.4 46.3 1 We have assumed that workers made redundant are entitled to 12 months' pay based on average annual service for simplicity. 2 For example the STA will adopt DfE's Resource Management (RM) system. 21. Overall the quantifiable benefits outweigh the quantifiable costs by \u00a346.3m over the 10 year period because of the significant savi ngs from the move to shared services. So this option has a very high NPV. Non-Monetised Benefits 22. There are additional benef its associated with moving to an Executive Agency model where it is not possible to quantify the economic benefits. 23. Ministers are clear that they are accountable to Parlia ment for delivery of this important part of the Gove rnment's education agenda. Bringing the work into an Agency within DfE provides for that clear line of accountability. QCDA's remit covers a number of functions and consequently delivery of an effective testing and assessment regime has to compete with other priorities. These competing priorities could create a risk of insufficient oversight at key points in the development and delivery of a robust testing and assessment regime because of its wider remit and priorities. Given the importance of - and risks associated with - statutory assessment and testing, providing more focused attention and resource is important. The Agency reporting directly to the relevant Director General within the DfE is expected to increase the transpar ency and accountability around these areas of work. 24. We think that overall the size of thes e non-monetised benefits is likely to be large. When taken together with the significant positive quantifi able benefits this is the preferred option. Option 3: Transfer responsibility for statutory assessment and testing into an existing Director ate of the DfE 25. Option three involves moving all the st atutory assessment and testing functions out of QCDA into a Directorate within the DfE, rather than into a separate Agency. We have assumed that the staf f numbers and costs associated with people moving into the Department are exactly the same as setting up a new Executive Agency. Consequently the measured co sts, benefits and NPV are the same as those for the creation of a new Agency. These are outlined in Table 2 below. Table 2 Option 3: Costs and Benefits from Moving STA Functions From QCDA into the Department for Education (\u00a3m) 2011- 12 2012- 13 2013- 14 2014- 15 2015-15 to 2020-21 Total Benefits 7.5 13.2 12.4 11.7 56.8 101.5 Costs 6.5 7.0 6.4 6.0 29.3 55.2 Net Benefits 1.1 6.2 6.0 5.6 27.4 46.3 Non-Monetised Costs: 26. There are a number of additional costs to option three over option two. The development and deliv ery of tests by which schools are held to account, and through which trends in national educationa l standards are measured, require high levels of public confidence. Giving dire ct responsibility for the current testing functions of QCDA to a Directorate in the Department - as opposed to an Executive Agency - would create reputational risks. The Government could be open to 5accusations of political interference in te st results, which would reduce confidence in their use in the accountability system. This would have an impact on the Government's ability to improve standards and identify underperformance in primary schools, significantly affecting the efficiency of the education system. Preferred Option: 27. Looking at both t he monetised and non-monetised cost s and the benefits of option two, the creation of a new Executive Agenc y, this option clearly provides more value for money, and fewer reputational and delivery risks than the other two options. Although option three - bringing the function in-house - has the same NPV as option two, the risks to the stat utory assessment and te sting system are too significant to make option three the preferred option. 4. Commercial Case 28. The key driver and priority for the Government is to provide a robust and reliable testing system that is fit for purpose. Lor d Bew's Review, which reported in June 2011, confirmed the important role of Key Stage 2 asse ssment and tests. In the light of this, although the DfE is not pl anning any changes to the current delivery model in the short term, the STA will c ontinue to keep under review its current testing arrangements, procuri ng services as appropriate. 5. Financial case 29. The section sets out t he financial costs associated with setting up the STA over the Spending Review (SR) period and compares them with the costs of carrying out STA's remit within the existing QCDA model. 30. Administrative costs for the STA are presented in Table 3 below. Programme costs are not published here because of their comm ercial sensitivity. For 2011-12, costs have been calculated from 1 October 2011 (t he Agency's go-live date) to 31 March 2012, consequently figures are lower than for later years. Table 3 STA Costs Over The SR Period For Finance Section (\u00a3ms) Oct 2011-12 2012- 13 2013- 14 2014- 15 Total SR Total Admin Costs 6.5 7.4 7.2 7.2 28.2 of which Admin Revenue Costs 6.2 7.4 7.2 7.2 27.9 Admin Capital Costs 0.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 31. Programme costs - not set out here to protect commercial interest - include the delivery of assessment and test developm ent, test delivery and development of services in response to the Bew Review. Ad ministrative costs total \u00a328.2m over the SR period. One-off costs associat ed with wider redundancy within QCDA, and nominally apportioned to Agency set-up, and t he implementation of new IT systems, 6nominally apportioned to Agency set-up, and the implementation of new IT systems, inflate costs in the first year. The vast majority of these costs are scored as revenue. 32.Table 4 shows the administrative costs of providing services if QCDA were to continue to deliver statutory assessment and testing from 1 October 2011 to 31 March 2015. Programme costs remain the same. Table 4 Financial Costs for statutory assessment and testing if functions had remained in QCDA (\u00a3ms) Oct 2011- 12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 Total SR Admin Revenue Costs 7.5 13.9 13.9 13.9 49.3 of which Admin Revenue Costs 7.5 13.9 13.9 13.9 49.3 Admin Capital Costs 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 33. Administrative costs total \u00a349.3m across the SR period.3 Comparing administrative costs across the SR period shows that moving to the STA reduces administrative costs by \u00a321.1m over the SR period. Consequently, there is a strong financial case for moving to an Executive Agency model. The setting up of a new Executive Agency also represents an efficiency saving of 42% on budgets that would have been allocated to statutory assessment and testing activities if QCDA had continued to exist so therefore meets the Department's efficiency targets. 6. Management Case 34. This section sets out the high level governance relationship between the DfE and the STA. The STA will form an integral part of the Department and will work within the policy framework set by Ministers and within the overarching strategy and frameworks set by the Department. The relationship between the Department, Ministers and the STA is set out in the Agency's Framework document, available at: www.education.gov.uk 35. The STA's high level governance structure is set out below: 3 The methodology used to derive a baseline for STA and split corporate and non-staff costs was outlined in the economic section. 7 STA independence 36. The STA will maintain independence from Ministers and the Department in relation to test standards, and level-setting. The Agency Framework document sets out protocols around this part of the STA's work and the CEO's responsibilities, specifying that the CEO will: sign off the content of NCTs, acting i ndependently of the DfE and Ministers; sign off the level-setting process, acting independently of the DfE and Ministers. This will be r egulated by Ofqual, in line with that organisation's regulatory framework. Ofqual will notify t he DfE of any emerging concerns at an early stage and report to Par liament as appropriate; and consider personally advising Minister s in the event of any Parliamentary Questions or other issues arising in relation to test standards and level- setting. 8Annex 1 STA's current remit Description Current remit and policy position Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (EYFSP) An assessment by a teacher or Early Years (EY) practitioner for each child at the end of the Early Years Foundation Stage against the early learning goals. STA will review local authorities' (LAs) plans for moderation of EYs settings' EYFSP assessment results and reports on compliance with the LA duty to ensure that the data is a ccurate and consistent. STA provides a helpdesk to assist EYs settings and LAs in using a tool to submit statutory data, and runs training and accreditation programmes for EYFSP moderators. STA will also publish an annual report with recommendations on EYFSP data. The Government is currently consulting on proposals for a new EYFSP, based on Dame Clare Tickell's recommended changes, to be implemented from September 2012 (alongside the new EYFS). Year 1 phonics screening check An assessment of each child at the end of year 1 to determine whether they have reached an appropriate level of phonic decoding. Pupils who have not reached the appropriate standard will be targeted by schools for further support and will be expected to retake the screening check during Year 2. The screening check was piloted in June 2011 and is currently being independently evaluated. Subject to this evaluation, it is expected to be rolled out in the academic year 2011- 12. STA will deliver this assessment to maintained schools with Year 1 Pupils. Key stage 1 assessment An assessment by a teacher for each pupil at the end of Key Stage 1 (usually year 2) informed by a nationally produced test/task. STA will manage contracts for developm ent and delivery of Key Stage 1 tests and tasks as well as review LAs' plans for moderation of schools' Key Stage 1 teacher assessment results. The current tests/tasks in circulati on were released in 2007 and 2009 (and produced in 2004). No new tests/tasks are available for release. A decision on producing new tests/tasks will be taken following the National Curriculum Review. 9 Description Current remit and policy position Key stage 2 tests Tests in English and mathematics that are taken by pupils at the end of Key Stage 2 (usually in Year 6) that are reported in school level tables. STA will be responsible for delivery of Key Stage 2 tests and for providing pupils' results to schools and for accountability purposes. The components of this work include: a. test development; b. school test orders; c. marker training ma terial development; d. marker recruitment, trai ning, payment and management; e. delivery and collection of tests materials to schools and to markers; f. electronic and hard copy return of results to schools by 14th July; g. management of school revi ew applications with outcomes returned to schools in September; h. processing maladministration cases; i. electronic collection of teacher assessment data and chase activity to schools. STA will carry out work on level setting (the process by which standards are set for the tests) thro ugh analysis of results of pre-tests and live tests. STA will also support LAs in their statutory requirement to monitor schools' arrangements for administering the tests and will collate these reports following the tests. The Bew Review considered the testing and accountability system for primary schools in England. The Re view's recommendations have been 10 Description Current remit and policy position accepted by the Government and will be implemented as soon as is practicable. Key stage 2 science sample test A test of science administered to a representative sample of schools for Key Stage 2 in order to generate national attainment data. STA will administer this sample test to a designated sample of schools in May with results returned to schools in July. The Bew Review has recommended that the current sampling tests in Key Stage 2 science continue until the National Curriculum Review has reported. At that point, new samp le tests might need to be produced. Key Stage 3 teacher assessment Collection of teacher assessment data for each pupils' attainment in core subjects at the end of Key Stage 3 (age 14). STA will manage contracts for the el ectronic collection of teacher assessment data and chase activity for schools which have not submitted data. Optional tests A suite of test materials that are available for schools to buy and use as they wish for Years 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9. The current suite of optional tests wil l continue to be made available for schools to purchase. Following the outcomes of the National Curriculum Review, new optional tests may need to be developed. National sampling at Key Stage 3 Following the end of whole cohort testing in Key Stage 3 in 2008, the only measure of national attainment at Key Stage 3 has been through teacher assessment. Ministers have indicated that they wish to review whether new sample tests for subjects at the end of Ke y Stage 3 are required following the National Curriculum Review. It is expected that if sample tests are required, this would become part of the STA remit. 11 12 Annex 2. Changes to the Current Syst em following recommendations from Lord Bew's Review Key changes to the current system will include: Replacing the current Writing te st with teacher assessment of writing composit ion from 2013. This will ensure pupils can be more creative and will reduce the dangers of teaching to the test. This teacher assessment will ma ke up the larger part of the overall writing judgment; Introducing moderation of writing teacher assessment, modeled on the system used at Key Stage 1. This will be introduced in summer 2012; Introducing a test of some of the essential skills needed to bec ome fluent confident writers - spelling, grammar, punctuation and vocabulary. This will be subject to technical pre- test in 2012 so that it can be introduced in 2013; Publishing more data in performa nce tables, including new three-y ear rolling averages from 2012, to give a more rounded picture of a school's performance; Placing a greater emphasis on progress made by pupils in published data; Passing primary schools' teacher assessment judgments to secondary schools ahead of test results, from 2012. This will mean there is more weight attached to them and allow longer for them to inform Year 7 teaching and learning. Schools will need to submit teacher assessment data earlier than at present, before NCT results are returned . This will start in summer 2013; For level 6 tests to be available for sc hools to use optionally, with the results contributing to published school accountabili ty measures; Trialing in 2012 an extension to the testing per iod, so that pupils who are absent (e.g. due to illness) on the day of a test w ill have a week in which to sit it, rather than two days; Looking to introduce on-screen marking as soon as is feasible. \u00a9 Crown copyright 2011 You may re-use this information (excluding logos) free of charge in any format or medium, under the terms of the Open Government Licence.
