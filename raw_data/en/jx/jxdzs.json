Complement activation There are 3 pathways of complement activation (see figure [Complement activation pathways](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/biology-of-the-immune-system/complement-system#v28604219) [ Complement activation pathways ](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/biology-of-the-immune-system/complement-system#v28604219) ): Classical Lectin Alternative Complement activation pathways The classical, lectin, and alternative pathways converge into a final common pathway when C3 convertase (C3 con) cleaves indicates activation. Classical pathway components are labeled with a C and a number (eg, C1, C3), based on the order in which they were identified. Alternative pathway components are often lettered (eg, factor B, factor D) or named (eg, properdin). Classical pathway activation is either Antibody-dependent, occurring interacts with RNA apoptotic cells), bacteria, or bound C-reactive protein reacts directly with C1 pathway is (C1-INH). angioedema (acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency) are caused by deficiency or dysfunction of complement 1 (C1) inhibitor, a protein involved in the regulation... read more ](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/allergic,-autoimmune,-and-other-hypersensitivity-disorders/hereditary-and-acquired-angioedema#v6516382) is due to a genetic deficiency of C1-INH. Lectin pathway activation is antibody-independent; it occurs when a serum protein, binds to mannose, fucose, or N-acetylglucosamine groups on bacterial cell walls, yeast walls, or viruses. This pathway otherwise resembles the classical pathway structurally and functionally. Alternate pathway activation occurs when components of microbial cell surfaces (eg, yeast walls, bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharide [endotoxin]) or immunoglobulin (eg, nephritic factor, aggregated IgA) cleave small amounts of C3. This pathway is regulated by properdin, factor H, and decay-accelerating factor (CD55). The 3 activation pathways converge into a final common pathway when C3 convertase cleaves C3 into C3a and pathways ](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/biology-of-the-immune-system/complement-system#v28604219) ). C3 cleavage may result in formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), the cytotoxic component of the complement system. MAC causes lysis of foreign cells. Factor I, with cofactors including membrane cofactor protein (CD46), inactivates C3b and C4b. Complement deficiencies and defects Deficiencies or defects in specific complement components have been linked to specific disorders; the following are factor I, or complement receptor 2 (CR2): Susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections Deficiency of C5, C9, factor B, factor D, or meningitis and meningococcemia.

Several CRs use molecules that have been assigned a CD number. CR1 (CD35) promotes phagocytosis and helps clear immune complexes. CR2 (CD21) regulates antibody production by B cells and is the Epstein-Barr virus receptor. CR3 (CD11b/CD18), CR4 (CD11c/CD18), C5a, and C4a (weakly) have anaphylatoxin activity: mast cell degranulation, leading to increased vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. C3b acts as an opsonin by coating microorganisms and thereby enhancing their phagocytosis. C3d enhances antibody production by B cells. C5a is a neutrophil chemoattractant; it regulates neutrophil and monocyte activities and may cause augmented adherence of cells, degranulation and release of intracellular enzymes from granulocytes, production of toxic oxygen metabolites, and initiation of other "}
