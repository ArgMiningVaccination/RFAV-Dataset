Blessing, RN", "date": "2023-01-17", "cleaned_text": "During a recent consultation and spiritual healing session a client told me, \"I know I'm a healer, and I want to do that but I can't right now because I have to work\". She expressed a desire to take some classes and begin a formal training program. But, she couldn't because she \"has to work\". So every day she says, she wakes up to a life she feels trapped in, wanting to be \"somewhere else.\" That creates stress and mismanaged energy, on a daily basis, between her head and her heart. Constantly running in a loop with no resolution. When that happens long enough the energy in our body becomes \"top-heavy\" and the lower energy centers become deficient. The top heavy energy creates symptoms of anxiety and insomnia and the lower body deficiency creates depression and hormonal imbalances. As corny as it may sound, [Gracon's](https://www.marthablessing.com/martha-blessing-channels-gracon/) message was, \"Once a healer, always a healer\". \"God will choose how and where he uses you. Your job is to trust and surrender.\" As I dug deeper with this client I was reminded of my own developmental journey as an intuitive healer. And as a result, the struggles and challenges I faced. The comment reminded me of a conversation I had with God when I was working as a nursing supervisor on an Alzheimer's Unit. I won't sugar coat it. I was in charge of some staff members that were really hard-core \"inner city\" kinda folk. I was frightened and intimidated by them on a regular basis They lashed out and did some vicious and mean things to retaliate against administrators decisions and directives. At the time, I was in the midst of my certification and Healing Touch training. I was an exuberant energy healer. Furthermore, my colleagues that gravitated towards the light were few and far between. Yet there were a couple. We tried desperately to lift each other up when the chips were down. One of them was our human resources director. One morning, I saw her... Visibly shaken by something that had happened. Someone had taken a beautiful stained glass angel she had hanging on the outside of her office door. It was smashed to pieces on the floor in front of her office door. She was frightened. She feared more retaliation. She felt it was in response to a disciplinary action she had been forced to take when following company protocol. I supported her as best I could with some energy healing. I remember telling God, \"This is bullshit, if you want me to be a healer ? Why are you putting me in these dark places where I can't make a difference and they' re not open to angels, healing, or light\"? While God's immediate answer was... \"It's exactly because of that darkness and resistance to angels, healing, and light that I need you to be here and make a difference\". Seems like I got it all wrong, back then. I just wanted to hang out with fellow healers and lightworkers. I wanted rainbows and unicorns. That's how empaths like it. Right? But the truth is, being in those situations and environment while developing my healing gifts served many Divine purposes. Consequently, it was exactly where I needed to be. It wasn't until years later, I understood the Divine plan or purpose. Those experiences taught me to grow a soul with stamina. They taught me how to stay present in the moment to balance my internal energy. And, to not go off in my head and spin around in fear. As a result, they taught me how to stand in my Divine Light power. And therefore, to go from quaking in my shoes, to standing firm, yet gentle, in my Light. Further more to do it in a balanced body and energy field. Seems like that's what I needed to learn for my development as an empath and healer... To not take on or absorb the energy of a slower and heavier vibration. Furthermore, Spirit was teaching me strengthening tools for my evolution. Okay, back to this client. Back to the Truth. The moment she said she was a physical therapy assistant at a nursing home, Gracon shouted out. \"Good God, she already is a healer. Can't she see that. Can't she see that she has the ability to use her light, right here and right now. To bring the presence of God into the lives of her patients? Most of all, as an assistant she has the legal right to touch these people and when she does she can fill them with Light. Even without touching them she can be filling them with light. Day to day life for these people in a skilled nursing facility is filled with some big decisions and life choices. They are approaching end of life care and decisions. God doesn't entrust the energy and care of these folks to just anyone. She has the opportunity to have a great impact on their life reviews and their transition back to the spiritual realm.\" Gracon went on to question me, her, and \"us humans\". That's just the way they are-have an attitude, or perhaps it's just my translation that has attitude. In any case, they continued. \"You need to know that we really wish you would release the desire to resist and question God's ability. He'll put you exactly where you need to be for your highest development of your Soul. If only you would choose to 'bloom where you are planted' and just keep learning to hold more Light. Because, no matter what your circumstances are, you would develop and move on so much more quickly.\" In addition, they told me, \"Yes, this gal needs to develop herself before she moves on to her next \"assignment\" but right now she isn't able or willing to see the beauty and purpose of where she is. Because she's trying too hard to be somewhere and someone other than where and what she is now. As if someplace else were better. It isn't. It's just different. She doesn't have to wait, she isn't supposed to wait, to become a healer. It isn't about taking a class to develop skills. She's getting on the job training from God!\" Also, she mentioned that the energy of administrators at her job was very stressful. She found many aspects of it distasteful. That is not an uncommon lament. But here's the thing- we're put in these places to stand powerful and infuse the darkness with healing light. When you build a soul with stamina by grounding in your own energy and Truth, you create a deep sense of energetic balance that can not be swayed with every little day-to-day detail. Our task in stressful moments is to BE the Divine presence, grounded and centered in our hearts. I know how hard this can seem! But it's not. Like anything, the more you practice the easier it is. But that not what most folks are practicing. They've lost sight of their belief in themselves and their inner wisdom and faith. Yet, each time we do we build a collective energy shift within, our environment changes on the outside!. It contributes a cumulative lift of energy within. If all we do is complain or feel slighted or overwhelmed, we become consumed with fear and anger and we haven't grown into the full expression of our True-self. If all we do is 'bide our time' until we move on to something else, we have missed the opportunity for spiritual development and growth. And therefore, to be a spiritual warrior \u2014 down in the trenches of planetary healing. This is the path of a true healer. To continue to shine your light in the midst of apparent darkness and discord. [Gracon's healing message ](https://www.marthablessing.com/martha-blessing-channels-gracon/)was to put all her attention on the Light within herself while giving and bringing more of it to her patients. To take her focus off of the administrative oppression and put it on her soul's purpose and evolution right now. All work is an opportunity by which you can get into the flow of Life. It doesn't matter what the nature of the work might be. What counts is the attitude with which you approach it. The support of the Universe is constant in you and the creative process is constantly seeking to flow forth through you. Meditate on this as you sit at your desk, (or wherever your work has you), You work and you are paid for your work. But if that is all you experience you will always be underpaid and unfulfilled, waiting and dreaming to be somewhere else. When I was able to realize that I was planted to be a beacon of Light for my residents, divinely placed there by God, it made the incidents and challenges from staff almost disappear. Because I was no longer aligned to fear and resistance. Because Spirit gives us what we need to complete our purpose. I mistakenly believed that we can choose what kind of healer we will be. Also, where our gifts will be unleashed or needed most. Almost always, the nature of how we can serve is planted and imprinted in our Soul's plan and DNA long before we are ever aware of it. Furthermore, it shows up differently for each individual...due to those inner inklings rising up from our desires. The most grace-full path of development is to listen to the inner callings. They are God/Source living in you, leading you to your expansion and greatness. As a result, the nature of where and how God has asked me to serve has been an incredible adventure for me. While it took me years to stop resisting and trust that I would grow right where I was, into the healer I was meant to become \u2014 All I had to do was stop thinking that Source had gotten it wrong. So all this client has to do is accept that she already is a healer and not be afraid of what that looked like. She didn't have to focus on her work all the time. She could take time for healing classes whenever the urge came to her. Putting one foot in front of the other, trusting that she'd land in the right spot. Surrender to the desire in your heart. Stop overthinking about making a living. [Ground yourself in your body and energy. ](https://www.marthablessing.com/unlock/)Stop running around in circles in your head. Open your heart to trusting yourself. Open yourself to loving yourself. Set your intention and then get out of your own way. Receive what comes to you....it's leading you to your greatest desires and expressions. "}
