Anthony Vernon Chief Executive Officer Kraft Foods Group, Inc. Northfield, Illinois 60093-2753 Re: Kraft Foods Group, Inc.'s misleading marketing and labeling of Crystal Light Drink Mix Products Dear Mr. Vernon: The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) has identified deceptive practices in the marketing 1 of several of Kraft's Crystal Light Drink Mix products (\"Crystal Decaffeinated Iced Tea.\". 2 This letter details CSPI's findings and offers to discuss resolution before CSPI takes further legal action. Ultimately, if litigation became necessary, CSPI would seek an injunction prohibiting Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (Kraft) from (1) expressly or implicitly making misleading \"natural\" claims about its Crystal Light products and (2) violating Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations governing flavoring 3 and statements of identity.4 CSPI also may seek corrective advertising, restitution, damages, disgorgement, and attorneys' fees. 1 The term \"marketing\" includes all forms of marketing in all forms of media and venues, including without limitation: print advertisements, television and radio commercials, websites, signage at restaurants, toys, advergaming, sponsorships, product labels, magazines, use of licensed characters, use of celebrities, viral marketing, school-based marketing (such as book covers and sponsored educational materials), and kids clubs. 2 Kraft manufactures and sells four lines of Crystal Light: \"Crystal Light Classics,\" This letter only addresses the \"Crystal Light Classics\" flavors listed above. 3 21 C.F.R. \u00a7101.22. Page 2 Facts Giving Rise to Kraft's Liability Kraft markets Crystal Light using \"natural\" claims, despite the presence of multiple artificial ingredients in the products. In Illustration 1, the word \"NATURAL\" appears in large, boldface letters at the center of the label. In Illustration 2, which depicts a print advertisement for Crystal Light, the \"natural\" claims are visible on the labels of the \"Natural Lemonade\" and \"Natural Pink Lemonade\" products. Illustration 1 \"Natural Lemonade\" and \"Natural Pink Lemonade,\" Crystal Light Drink Mix Products 4 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3. Page 3 Illustration 2 Crystal Light Print Advertisment I. Kraft's Crystal Light Drink Mixes are misbranded By placing the term \"natural\" in bolded capital letters at the center of its Crystal Light product labels, Kraft conveys to consumers that the products have no chemically altered or man-made ingredients and are a healthier, safer, and more nutritious choice than similar products that do not bear the term \"natural.\" In reality, the \"Natural Lemonade,\" \"Natural Lemon Decaffeinated Iced Tea\" varieties of Crystal Light contain artificial sweeteners, artificial colors, and artificial flavors that are inconsistent with the bold \"natural\" claims on the front of the package. Consumers expect the term \"natural\" to describe products that contain no artificial or synthetic ingredients and consist entirely o f ingredients that are only minimally processed. 5 For example, while reasonable consumers might expect \"Natural Lemonade\" to include sugar and lemon, consumers likely would not expect \"Natural Lemonade\" to contain citric acid, potassium citrate, sodium citrate, aspartame, magnesium oxide, maltodextrin, unnamed natural flavor (s), acesulfame potassium, soy lecithin, artificial color, Yellow 5, and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). By marketing its Crystal Light products as \"natural,\" Kraft deceives consumers and takes advantage of their preference for foods 5 Nat'l Consumers League, Naturally Misleading: Consumers' Understanding of \"Natural\" and \"Plant Derived\" Labeling Claims 4, available at www.nclnet.org /images/PDF/naturalsreport.pdf. Page 4 made entirely with natural ingredients.6 Kraft's use of the term \"natural\" to describe Crystal Light creates consumer confusion, is deceptive, and detrimentally affects sales of competing products that are actually naturally produced or contain only ingredients that are chemically unchanged from their natural state. FDA has stated \"the agency has not objected to the use of the term if the food does not contain added color, artificial flavors, or synthetic substances .\" 7 FDA has used Warning Letters to enforce this definition by prohibiting \"natural\" claims on products containing artificial colors 8 and preservatives.9 6 In a survey, the most popular food label among consumers was \"100% natu ral.\" \"All natural ingredients\" was the second most popular food label among consumers. See e.g., Consumers Prefer '100% Natural' Label Over 'Organic', E NVIRONMENTAL LEADER (Jul. 3, 2009), www.environmentalleader.com/2009/07/ 03/consumers-prefer-100-natural-label-over-organic (describing EcoPulse market report by Shelton Group) (last visit December 6, 2013). In 2009, the term \"natural\" was the most frequently used claim on new U.S. food products. Karlene Lukovitz, \"Natural\" Claims Most Common on New F&B Products, MediaPostnews (Jan. 19, 2009), available at www.mediapost.com/publications/ article/98562/#axzz2YsPn6CWO. As of 2010, \"natural\" foods constituted roughly a 422.6 billion industry, outselling organic foods by more than four to one.

Because your products contain this synthetic ingredient, the use of Page 5 With ingredients such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium, Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1, maltodextrin and BHA, Crystal Light products contain artificial colors, artificial flavors, and synthetic substances. Kraft's Crystal Light products therefore fail to meet not only consumer expectations, but also FDA's standard for \"natural.\" Illustration 3 \"Natural Lemonade\" Crystal Light Drink Mix Ingredient List A. Artificial Sweeteners Kraft's Crystal Light products contain the artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame potassium. Those are factory-made synthetic ingredients and do not occur in nature. (In addition to labeling concerns, aspartame has been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals, including leukemia, lymphoma, and mammary cancer as well as brain, liver, lung, and kidney tumors. 10 Research on the claim \"All Natural\" on this product label is false and misleading, and therefore your product is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Act.\"). 10 See F.

Artificial Colors Crystal Light products contain Red 40, Yellow 5, and Blue 1. These artificial dyes are synthesized in factories from petroleum and do not occur in nature. (Food dyes increase the risk of allergic reactions and hyperactivity in children. FDA has considered several dyes to be carcinogenic or contaminated with cancer-causing contaminants. 12 In 2008, because of the link between artificial dyes and hyperactivity, CSPI petitioned FDA to ban the use of these dyes13 and in 2011 FDA acknowledged that dyes could impair the behavior of some children. 14 The British government and European Union have already taken action to remove the use of dyes from the European food supply.)

It is used in processed foods as a filler and to enhance texture and flavor.15 D. BHA BHA is a synthetic preservative that is made in a factory and does not occur in nature.16 Studies have shown that BHA can cause tumors in rats, mice, and hamsters and liver cancer in fish.17 As a result, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program has stated that BHA is \"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.\"18 II. Kraft's Crystal Light Drink Mixes violate FDA regulations governing flavoring and statements of identity As evident in Illustration 4, Kraft manipulates font size, spacing, and word choice to create a deceptively designed front of package label that implies that all of the ingredients in its Crystal Light products are \"natural\" and not just some of the flavors. As a result, the labels on Kraft's Crystal Light products are not only misleading, they are also in violation of FDA regulations governing flavoring and statements of identity. 15 CSPI website, Chemical Cuisine, www.cspinet.org/reports/chemcuisine.htm#malt (last visited December 6, 2013). 16 CSPI website, Chemical Cuisine, www.cspinet.org/reports/chemcuisine.htm#bha (last visited January 3, 2014). 17 See IARC, Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) In Some Naturally Occurring and Synthetic Food Components, Furocoumarins and Ultraviolet Radiation, 40 MONOGRAPHS ON THE EVALUATION OF CARCINOGENIC RISK OF CHEMICALS TO HUMANS , 123-159 (1986); T.

Page 8 Illustration 4 Close-up of Deceptive \"Natural Lemonade\" Crystal Light Drink Mix Label Kraft deceptively labels its Crystal Light products by conflating flavoring and statement of identity regulations. The distinction is important: while the claim \"natural\" may describe some Crystal Lights flavorings, it does not describe any Crystal Light products. The regulations require that a product's statement of identity consist of \"the common or usual name of the food.\" 19 The \"common or usual\" names for lemonade and tea are lemonade and tea, respectively. \"Lemonade,\" \"Pink Lemonade,\" and \"Iced Tea\" are therefore not flavors, but components of the statement of identity. For example, an appropriate statement of identity would be \"Lemonade Drink Mix.\" Kraft's Violations of State Consumer Protection Laws Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), a food is misbranded if \"its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.\" 20 Kraft purposefully deceives consumers into believing its Crystal Light products are entirely \"natural,\" when, in fact, the adjective only applies to specific flavoring ingredients. Through this deception, Kraft labels its Crystal Light products as \"natural\" even though they contain multiple artificial ingredients. Kraft's misrepresentations render Crystal Light misbranded in violation of the FDCA, as well as state food and drug laws, such as California's Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law. In addition, Kraft's claims violate state consumer protection laws such as Massachusetts G.L. c. 93A, Texas Business & Professions Code \u00a7 17.41 et seq., District of Columbia Code \u00a7 28-3905 et seq., New Jersey Statutes Ann. 56:8-1 et seq., California Business & Professions Code Sections 17200 and 17500, and California Civil Code \u00a7\u00a7 1770(a)(5) & 1770(a)(14). As the manufacturer and distributor of Crystal Light, Kraft is responsible for the injuries caused by its actions. Consumer injury occurs each time a 19 21 C.F.R. \u00a7101.3(b)(2). 20 FDCA \u00a7 403(a)(1). Page 9 consumer sees marketing for or purchases one of these products. Each occurrence is a separate injury.21 Settlement Demand In light of the foregoing, CSPI invites Kraft to resolve these instances of illegal and deceptive advertising in order to avoid further legal action. CSPI seeks to prevent Kraft from deceptively advertising Crystal Light products as \"natural.\" Of course, adhering to honest marketing practices will only benefit Kraft and its customers in the long term. Should Kraft choose not to respond to CSPI's findings, CSPI will pursue litigation to seek the following: Entry of a permanent injunction that prohibits Kraft from representing (either expressly or implicitly) that its \"Natural Lemonade,\" \"Natural Pink Lemonade,\" Decaffeinated Iced Tea\" Crystal Light products are \"natural.\" Disgorgement of Kraft's profits from the sale of Crystal Light. If Kraft is willing to discuss a settlement or requires additional information about the claims documented herein, we welcome contact from counsel.
