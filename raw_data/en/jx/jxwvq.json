Few books approach this theme in a comparable manner. Heinz Zimmermann was a true master of the word in his mother tongue, German. For this reason, his work with Rudolf Steiner's many meditations represent real keys which often unlock levels of comprehension which might have remained inaccessible even to those persons familiar with the specific meditation. But the help which the authors of this book offer also speaks to the meditative process in itself which may at first have eluded even an earnest seeker. The authors give an overview of the fundamentals of anthroposophical meditation and practical possibilities for the development of an inner life. At the center is the ability to guide oneself on this journey and how the fruits of the meditative work can support everyday life. As a leitmotif are the views of the book of Rudolf Steiner \"Knowledge of the higher worlds.\" The authors share and enlighten with examples their experience of many years of teaching. They explain how to build a meditative journey and begin a spiritual development. Thus, the book addresses the beginner and the advanced student with new multiple incentives. At the end of the book, the most important meditations and exercises by Rudolf Steiner are presented and explained. -From the foreword by Virginia Sease C O N T E N T S: Forward - Meditation and Anthroposophy - Creating an Inner Space - Preparatory Exercises - Forms of Meditation - The Path of Cognition and Art - Meditation and Self-Knowledge - Conditions of Esoteric Schooling - Meditative Work in Groups - On the Essence of the Anthroposophical Path of Schooling Appendix: Selected Indications on Meditation from the Works of Rudolf Steiner Notes Bibliography About the Author Heinz Zimmermann was born in Basel, where he attended the Rudolf Steiner School.
