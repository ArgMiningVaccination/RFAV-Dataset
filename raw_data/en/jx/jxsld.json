Respectfully excuseyourself andanswerthepage immediately.Surgery Suite Etiquette Smallopportunities Theoperating room isyour\"kingdom,\" others;however, quiteoften, you mustschedule theprocedure yourself. Whether the patientsare from the clinicorprivateoffice, have elective oremergency surgeries, make every effort to schedule the procedure yourself. Donot assign thisimportant function to anurseor secretary.

Remember, you may fool the scheduler the first time, but not thesecondtime.

Drawbacks One of the drawbacks ofscheduling procedures yourself isthatyouwillhavenobodytoblamebutyourselfwhen thingsgo wrong. Consider the following: Schedule early. Schedule honestly.
