But this freedom is not absolute. Indeed,throughout most of the nation's history, religious practices have often been subordinated to a variety of government laws and regulations. It was not untilthe 1960s that courts began to seek a more finely tuned balance between thegovernment's public policy needs and peoples' interest in practicing their faithunencumbered by government regulations or requirements. The foundation of religious liberty in America is the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states that Congress\"shall make no law ... prohibiting the free exercise\" of religion.This constitu-tional protection was born out of the Founding Fathers' desire to foster andsafeguar dfreedom of religion.They hoped that, by protecting freedom of wor- ship, they would shield what was already a religiously diverse country from thekinds of religious conflict that had raged in Europe through much of the 16thand 17th centur ies. Manyof the fir st Eur opean settler sin Amer ica w ere refugees from these reli- gious conflicts. Ironically, some of these refugees, such as the Puritans of Massachusetts, went on to found colonies that had official or state-sanctioned churches and to punish indi viduals who dissented fr om estab lished for ms of worship. By the mid-18th century, however, most Protestants in America had earned some measure of religious toleration and freedom. But Catholics, Jews, atheists and other r eligious minor ities r emained largely outside the scope of religious liberty protections. It was the Fir st Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s and the American Revolution later in the 18th century that ultimately created a new climate for religious freedom. Between 1776 and 1790, for example, many states included provisions guaranteeing fr eedom of w orship in their new constitutions.And in RELIGION AND THE COURTS: THE PILLARS OF CHURCH-STATE LAW 1791, the Fir st Amendment was ratified as part of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, known as the Bill of Rights. The Fir st Amendment's guarantee that the federal government will respect the \"free exercise\" of reli-gion seems relatively straightforward. However, in most religious liberty cases, courts have grappled with the same difficult question: Do indi viduals or groups professing sincerely held religious beliefs have a right because of those beliefs to be exemptfrom legal requirements generally imposed on all citizens? While the question has remained the same, the courts' answer has changed repeatedly.Indeed, more than a century of Supreme Court decisions in this area have forged a ragged path from one extreme to the other, with a number ofpermutations in between. The issue was first addressed by the Supreme Court in the last decades of the 19th century in anumber of cases concerning polygamy - religious- ly based plural marriages practiced at that timeamong some members of the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints. Polygamy had beenoutlawed by the federal government in 1862. Inthe polygamy rulings, the court established theprecedent that while the Free Exercise Clause pro-tected religious \"beliefs,\" it did not shield reli-giously motivated \"actions\" that came into conflictwith the law. Then, beginning in the early 1960s,the court reversed course and issued a number ofrulings that embraced the idea that the FreeExercise Clause could exempt religiously motivated actions from certain generally applicable legalrequirements. Even important government con- cerns, such as the education of children, were cur- tailed in the interest of religious liberty. But by the 1990s, the court once again changed direction and largely re-established the doctrine forged in the19th-centur ypolygamy cases. This, in turn, prompted a reaction from the U.S. Congress andsome state legislatures, which passed laws aimed atoffering greater protection for religious liberty. page 2 The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme CourtTABLE OF CONTENTS Limitations on Free Exercise Rights: Polygamy and Other Early Cases ....... 3 Glimmers of Change: The Cantwell Decision and the Jehovah's Witnesses Cases ...... 4 Warren Court: Expansion of Free Exercise Rights ...................... 6 Burger Court: Expansion and Contraction of Free Exercise Rights ............... 8 The Smith Decision:The Court Returns to the Belief-Action Distinction ......... 10 The City of Hialeah andLocke Decisions: Reaffirming the Smith Decision ....... 12 State Court and Legislative Responses to the Smith Decision ............... 14 Looking Ahead ...................... 16 [I]n most religious liber ty cases , courts have grappled with the same difficult question: Do individuals or groups professing sincerel yheld religious beliefs have a right because of those beliefs to be exempt from legal requirements generally imposed on all citiz ens?These shifting interpretations of the right to free exercise illustrate the fact that the country - nottomention the courts - has yet to reach a consen- sus on exactly how to accommodate religiousbeliefs and practices.Whether the appointments oftwo new justices to the Supreme Court (ChiefJustice John Roberts in 2005 and Justice SamuelAlito in 2006) will help forge this elusive consen-sus remains to be seen. But if history is any guide,judges, politicians and citizens will continue tospar over the exact meaning of \"free exercise\" fordecades to come. LIMITATIONS ON FREE EXERCISE RIGHTS POLYGAMY AND OTHER EARLY CASES The Supreme Court's first decisions concerning the Free Exercise Clause arose from the federal govern-ment's campaign in the late 19th century againstpolygamy among members of the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints (LDS) - also known asMormons - in the Utah, Idaho and Arizona terri-tories. In Reynolds v. United States (1879), the court upheld the successful cr iminal pr osecution of a prominent Mormon, George Reynolds, for practic- ing bigamy in Utah. Reynolds had argued that itwas a religious obligation for him to take multiple wives and that the Free Exercise Clause should immunize him from prosecution. But the courtconcluded that while the Fr ee Ex ercise Clause guarantees freedom of religious belief, it does not protect religiously motivated actions - such aspolygam y-if those actions conflict with the la w. Writing for a unanimous cour t,Chief J ustice Morrison Waite said,\"Laws are made for the gov-ernment of actions, and while they cannot inter- fere with mere religious belief and opinions, theymay [interfere] with practices.\"Waite went on tostate that to permit someone to use religious beliefas an excuse to ignore legal requirements would\"in effect ... permit every citizen to become a lawunto himself.\" Adecade later, in another case that involved polygamy, the Supreme Court reinforced the viewthat the federal government may suppress religiouspractices that conflict with the law. In Davis v. Beason (1890), the court upheld the conviction of an LDS church member who had falsely sworn apublic oath that he did not advocate or believe in polygamy, as was required at the time from persons who sought to vote in the Utah, Idaho or Arizonaterritories.The r ight of fr ee exercise,the court ruled in Davis ,provided no defense to the charge of swearing a f alse oath, even though Davis him- self had not engaged in a plural mar riage. The same year as the Davis ruling, the Supreme Court upheld lower court orders that had placedthe entir eLDS church and all of its property under the control of the federal government onthe grounds that the church and its leadershipconstituted an organization that unla wfully advo- page 3 The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme CourtIn the polygamy rulings, the court established the precedent that while the Free Exercise Clause protected religious \"beliefs ,\"it did not shield religiousl ymotivated \"actions\" that came into conflict with the law .cated plural marriage. Only after the church firmly and formally renounced polygamy later that yeardid the federal government relinquish control andrestore the church's property. The Supreme Court's opinions in Reynolds and Davis , which rejected the idea that religiously motivated actions were exempt from general laws,remained controlling precedents for more than 70years. Not until the 1960s, under Chief JusticeEarl Warren and his successors, did the court begin to issue decisions that expanded the type of activity protected by the Free Exercise Clause.But even before Warren's tenure as chief justice,the Supr eme Court issued a number of important decisions that began to reshape the government's role in safeguarding religious freedom. GLIMMERS OF CHANGE THE CANTWELL DECISION AND THE JEHOVAH'SWITNESSES CASES The most impor tant of these pr e-Warren rulings was handed do wn in Cantwell v .Connecticut (1940). In this decision, the court held that the Free Ex ercise Clause applied to the states on the grounds that religious freedom is part of the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause, which protects \"life,liberty and pr operty\" against arbitrary inter- ference by the states. Until Cantwell ,the Free Exercise Clause had regulated only the actions of the federal go vernment and did not in an yway apply to state la ws or actions regarding religion. In the end, however,Cantwell 'spotential impact on religious freedom was tempered by the factthat the case was ultimately more about freedomof speech than the free exercise of religion. Jesse Cantwell had been convicted of disturbing thepeace after he played an anti-Catholic record on astreet corner in New Haven, Conn.The courtoverturned his conviction, but the decisionemphasized Cantwell's First Amendment right tofree speech as well as religious liberty. Thus, Cantwell implicitly reaffirmed the core principle of Reynolds and Davis that the Free Exercise Clause affords no special exemption for religious actionsthat contravene the law. Around the same time that Cantwell was decided, the court issued two related rulings that further affirmed the interpretation of the Free ExerciseClause spelled out in Reynolds and Davis .I n Minersville School District v. Gobitis (1940), the court ruled that the clause did not give religiouslymotivated public school children, who in this casewere Jehovah's Witnesses, the right to opt out of acompulsory flag-salute ceremony. The Gobitis decision led to reports that Jehovah's Witnesses were being threatened and even physically assault-ed for r efusing to salute the flag. Just three years later, the court took up a virtually identical case , once again involving the refusal of page 4 The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme CourtIn the end, however, Cantwell 's potential impact on religious freedom w as tempered b ythe fact that the case was ultimately more about freedom of speech than the free ex ercise of religion.page 5 The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme CourtReynolds v. United States (1879) Upheld the successful criminal prosecution of a promi- nent Mormon for practicing bigamy in Utah. Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940) In overturning a conviction for disturbing the peace, held that the Free Exercise Clause applies to state aswell as federal actions. Minersville School District v. Gobitis (1940) Ruled that the Free Exercise Clause did not give reli- giously motivated public school children the right to opt out of a compulsory flag-salute ceremony. West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette (1943) Overruled Gobitis and recognized the r ight not to par - ticipate in a flag-salute cer emon ybased on the right of free speech and worship. U.S. v. Ballard (1944) In a case involving a faith healer who claimed to possess super natural healing po wers,ruled that govern- ment cannot question the tr uth or v alidity of some - one's religious beliefs but is free to examine whether such beliefs are sincerely held. Braunfeld v.Brown (1961) Rejected an argument fr om Jewish businessmen who observed a Saturday Sabbath and opposed a law thatrequired businesses to close on Sundays. Sherber tv.Verner (1963) Ruled that a South Carolina unemployment policy forcing an employee to choose between her faith's Saturday Sabbath and eligibility for unemployment benefits violated the Free Exercise Clause. Wisconsin v.Yoder (1972) Ruled that the Free Exercise Clause exempted the adolescent children of the Old Order Amish from compulsor yschool attendance la ws. Bob Jones University v. United States (1983) Rejected a First Amendment challenge to the Internal Revenue Service's policy of denying tax-exempt statusto nonprofit educational institutions that had racially discriminatory policies. Goldman v.Weinberger (1986) Ruled that the Free Exercise Clause did not exempt a Jewish Air Force captain from the rule that forbade the wearing of any headgear indoors. O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz (1987) Ruled that security considerations provided a reason- able basis for restricting prison inmate attendance at aMuslim religious service. Employment Division v. Smith (1990) Upheld the denial of unemployment compensation to twoNativeAmer ican drug rehabilitation counselors who had been dismissed because they had ingested the hallucinogen peyote as part of a religious ritual. Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah (1993) Ruled that the city of Hialeah's ordinances on the treatment of animals discriminated against the Santerian faith and its practice of animal sacrifice. Locke v. Davey (2004) Ruled that a Washington state higher education sub- sidy that excluded those who majored in devotionalreligious studies was constitutional. City of Boer ne v. Flores (1997) Ruled that Congress lacks the power to substitute its judgment for that of the federal judiciary on thenorms of religious liberty that states must obey. Gonzales v . O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal (2006) Ruled that RFRA protects the right of a small religious sect to import and use a hallucinogenic substance in its religious rituals. Cutter v.Wilkinson (2005) Rejected the argument that the portion of a federal religious fr eedom statute that covers prisoners and other institutionalized persons violates the First Amendment' sEstablishment Clause.The Free Exercise Clause: Significant Supreme Court RulingsJehovah's Witnesses to salute the flag. This time, though, the result was quite different. In West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), the court overruled Gobitis and recognized students' right not to participate in such a ceremony. Butlike the Cantwell decision, the ruling in Barnette still did not recognize a religion-based right to spe- cial treatment. Instead, the court again based thedecision on the right of free speech, concludingthat the school board had no power to compel anystudent, regardless of the reasons for the student'sresistance, to participate in a ritual of patriotism. Thus the Barnette case did not alter the court's general r ule on the Free Exercise Clause that had been laid out in Reynolds and subsequent deci- sions. Indeed, shortly after Barnette , the court further affir med the same pr inciple in Prince v. Massac husetts (1944). In that case, it held that the Free Ex ercise Clause did not ex empt a member of the Jehovah'sWitnesses fr om child labor la ws even though the child w as selling religious materials as amatter of r eligious duty . However, the same year as the Prince ruling, the courthanded do wn another decision that affir med the other, more religion-friendly side of the Reynolds doctrine - that the Free Exercise Clause protects religious belief.That case, U.S. v. Ballard (1944), centered on the conviction for mail fraud of Guy Ballard, a faith healer who claimed to pos-sess supernatural healing powers. In Ballard , the high court ruled that the state cannot question thetruth or validity of someone's religious beliefs - inthis case, the state could not pass judgment onBallard's belief that God grants certain people,including himself, special powers of healing.Thecourt went on to say, however, that the govern-ment isfree to examine whether someone holds such beliefs sincerely.As a result, the court upheldBallard's conviction and ruled that the judge in hiscase had cor rectly charged the jury in his fraudtrial with deciding whether Ballard's religious claims were made sincerely and in good faith. WARREN COURT EXPANSION OF FREE EXERCISE RIGHTS During the 1950s and 1960s, the Supreme Court, under the leader ship of Chief Justice Warren, issued a ser ies of groundbreaking rulings that overturned long-standing precedents and policies in civil rights and other areas, including the freeexercise of religion. The court's opinion in Braunfeld v. Brown (1961) was an indication that the standards set out in Reynolds and subsequent cases might change. In Braunfeld , the court decided a legal challenge by several OrthodoxJewish store owners to a Pennsylvania law thatrequired most retail stores to close on Sundays.TheJewish businessmen argued that the law disadvan-taged people like themselves who closed onSaturdays to observe their Sabbath and that the FreeExercise Clause should be construed to exempt them from the requirement to close on Sundays. In the cour t'smajor ity opinion, Warren noted that the burden of the law on the businessmen was \"indirect,\" because it did not force them to vio- late their o wn Sabbath. But e ven in a case of indi - rect burdens,Warren wrote, the government might not be justified in enforcing the law if it could accomplish its pur pose \"bymeans which do not impose such a b urden.\" In this instance, how- ever,Warren concluded that the government lacked an easily administer ed alter nativeto achieve its purpose - a uniform day of rest. Accordingly, the court rejected the businessmen's argument. Nevertheless, the ruling suggested a new receptiveness on the part of the court to the page 6 The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme Courtuse of the Free Exercise Clause to protect reli- giously motivated behavior. T wo years later, in Sherbert v.Verner (1963), the implications of Braunfeld became clear.Adele Sherbert was a Seventh-day Adventist and thusobserved Saturday as the Sabbath. Her employerfired her for refusing to work on Saturdays, and shewas unable to obtain other work because other jobsshe sought also required Saturday work. Public offi-cials in South Carolina rejected her application forunemployment compensation on the grounds thatshe had failed, without good cause, to accept \"suit-able work when offered.\"The government arguedthat this policy pr otected its interest in preventing people from making false claims of religious obser- vance in order to qualify for unemployment bene-fits,and the state Supr eme Cour tagreed. In a landmark decision, the U .S.Supreme Court reversed the state high cour t'sdecision. Justice William Brennan's majority opinion described South Car olina' sunemplo yment policy a dir ect burden on Sherber t'sreligious fr eedom because it forced her to choose between the Saturday Sabbath r equired byher faith and eligibility for unemployment benefits.\"Governmental imposi- tion of such a choice,\" Brennan wrote,\"puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine imposed against [Sherbert]for her Saturday worship.\" Having determined that the law imposed a burden on Sherbert's religious liberty, the court went onto establish an important doctrine for future cases.When the state refuses to accommodate religiouslymotivated conduct, Brennan wrote, it must showthat it has a \"compelling interest\" for denying suchclaims. In other words, the government cannot interfere with someone's sincere religious practiceunless it can show that the interference furthers aclear and impor tant public interest.Applying the compelling interest requirement to free exercise cases was a marked departure from the 1879 Reynolds polygam ydecision. Indeed, before Sherbert , the requirement of compelling interest had appear ed only in cases that in volved freedom of speech and racial discr imination. In Sherbert , the court concluded that the government had offer ed no pr oof to suppor tits alleged interest in preventing w orkersfrom making fraudulent claims of Saturday religious observance in order to qualify for unemplo yment benefits. The court thereforeordered the state to pa ySherber tunem- ployment benefits. In his dissent, Justice J ohn Mar shall Harlan, joined byJustice Byron White, argued that the court's opinion car ved out a special exemption for reli- gious observance from the general requirement that emplo yees must be available for work. In doing so, he wrote, the court compelled the state to subsidize Sherbert's religious practices.Althoughthe state was free to choose such a course, Harlanasserted, the Constitution did not require it. Many saw the Sherbert decision as a victory for the principle that all religions should be treated equal-ly in the e yes of the la w. In this case, South Carolina had a Sunday closing law (similar to the Pennsylvania law noted above) that favored work-erswho obser ved Sunday as the Sabbath and pro- tected them against the hard choice imposed on Sherbert and those of other faiths (like the Jewish page 7 The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme CourtMajority: Black Brennan Clark DouglasGoldberg StewartWarrenMinority: v. Verner (1963)businessmen in Braunfeld )whose Sabbath falls on another day. But others saw the ruling as a path togranting special privileges for religion. In particu-lar, they worried that the compelling interest testwould tip the balance in favor of religious exerciseand would lead to more and broader claims forspecial religiously based exemptions from legalrequirements generally imposed on all citizens. BURGER COURT EXPANSION AND CONTRA CTION OF FREE EXERCISE RIGHTS Early in the ten ure of Chief Justice Warren Burger ,who w as appointed to lead the Supr eme Court in 1969, the court issued a decision that dramatically reinforced the principles laid down in Sherber t.The case ,Wisconsin v .Yoder(1972), involved a challenge by members of the OldOrder Amish to a state law that required all chil-dren to attend school until the age of 16. The Amish, who eschew many aspects of modern life, objected to high school education for their chil-dren because they believed that the experience exposed their young to worldly influences, com-petitive values and material concerns inconsistentwith life in a traditional Amish community.As aresult, a number of Amish parents had removedtheir children from school at age 14.WhenWisconsin charged these parents with violatingthe state's school attendance statute, the parentsreplied that the law, as applied to them, infringedupon their right to the free exercise of religion. In a 6-1 decision, the court ruled that Wisconsin indeed had violated the Amish parents' free exer-cise rights.Writing for the majority, Burger statedthat r equiring Amish children to attend school until age 16 threatened the longstanding customs of the Amish community. Moreover, Burgerstressed, these traditions w ereclearly g rounded in religious belief. The court then subjected Wisconsin' sschool attendance la wtothe com - pelling inter est test fir st set out in the Sherber tcase and found that although the state had a str ong interest in a w ell-educated populace ,its interest in the extra per iod of for mal education betw een ages 14 and 16 was relatively small, especially with regardto childr en who were part of a traditional farming community.At the same time, Burger asserted, the impact on the Amish of continued formal schooling at these ages was substantial. \"During this period, the children must acquireAmish attitudes favoring manual work and self-reliance and the specific skills needed to performthe adult role of an Amish farmer or housewife,\"he wrote. As noted, many people had wondered whether the Sherbert decision would lead to frequent special exemptions for the free exercise of religion.With Yoder,the answer seemed to be \"yes.\" Indeed, the court took pains in its ruling to emphasize that itwas the deep religious beliefs of the Amish that jus-tified this extraor dinary constitutional protection. page 8 The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme CourtMajority: Blackmun Brennan BurgerMarshall Powell RehnquistSupreme Court Case Wisconsin v.Yoder (1972) Note: While Justice William Douglas agreed with the major ity's overall rational, he dissented in par tbecause he believed that the case should be sent bac kto the lower courts for reconsideration. Justice Lewis Powell and Justice William Rehnquist did not par ticipate in the decision because they were not y et on the cour twhen the case was argued.On the other hand, the judicial methodology employed in Yoder -weighing the gains to the state against the costs to the Amish - involved a balanc-ing of interests.Thus the ruling was no guaranteethat in all future free exercise cases the court wouldtip in favor of religiously motivated behaviors. Indeed, in the years immediately following Yoder, the court was generally reluctant to exempt reli- giously motivated actions from general legal requirements. From 1972 to 1990, the SupremeCourt ruled in favor of free exercise claims in onlythree cases, and all three - like Sherbert - involvedunemployment compensation. In the first deci-sion, Thomas v. Review Board (1981), the court ordered the state of Indiana to pay unemploymentbenefits to a member of the Jehovah's Witnesseswho, for religious reasons, had left his job in a fac-tory that had switched to the manufacture ofmunitions. Later, in Hobbie v . Unemployment Appeals Commission (1987), the court protected the unemployment benefits of a Florida womanwho had been fir ed from her job after she becameaSeventh-day Adventist and informed her employer that she could no longer work onSaturdays because it was now her Sabbath.Likewise, in Frazee v. Illinois Department of Employment Security (1989), the court ordered Illinois to pay unemployment benefits to anemployee who believed that Sunday was the\"Lord's Day\" (though he did not attend worshipservices on that day) and was fired from his jobbecause he refused to work on Sundays. In some of the cases in which the court rejected free exercise claims, it applied a less rigorous versionof the compelling interest test than it had in earlierdecisions. For example, in Bob Jones Univ ersity v. United States (1983), the court rejected a First Amendment challenge to the Internal RevenueService'spolicy of den ying tax-ex empt status to nonpr ofit educational institutions that had racially discriminator ypolicies. The uni versity argued that even though it pr ohibited inter racial dating among its students, it should retain its tax-exempt status because the school' sdating policy w as grounded in the institution' sreligious v alues. The cour trejected the university's claim, and in doing so dispensed with the detailed balancing test it had used in Sherbert and Yoder.With minimal analysis, the court found that the government's interest in ending racial discrimination was a sufficiently compelling one and dismissed the notion that the universitywould be severely burdened by the loss of its taxexemption.The court did not attempt to rigorouslyassess whether allowing the university to keep theexemption would seriously impede the govern-ment's civil rights enforcement effort. In several other post- Yoder decisions, the court refused to apply the compelling interest test becausethe justices concluded that the issues in volved situa- tions that should not be closely monitored by thejudiciary. For example, in Goldman v.Weinberger (1986), the court held that the compelling interest page 9 The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme Court[T]he judicial methodology employed in Y oder -weighing the gains to the state against the costs to the Amish - inv olved a balancing of interests .Thus the ruling w as no guarantee that in all future free exercise cases the court would tip in f avor of religiousl y motivated behaviors.test should not be applied to the military. Accordingly, the court ruled against a Jewish AirForce captain who sought the right to wear a yar-mulke - a religious head covering - despite the AirForce rule that forbade the wearing of any headgearindoors. By a 5-4 vote, the court held that thejudicial branch should not interfere with militaryjudgments about when religious exemptions frommilitary policies should be allowed. In O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz (1987), the court similarly invoked a policy of deference to officialswho administer prisons.Ahmad Uthman Shabazzand other Muslim inmates had challenged NewJersey state prison policies that made it impossible for them to attend Jum'ah, Friday afternoon Muslim prayer services. Chief Justice WilliamRehnquist, writing for a 5-4 major ity,asserted that judges should defer to pr ison policies that are sup- ported by\"reasonab le penological interests.\" this considerations of r ehabil - itation and secur ity provided a reasonable basis for restrictions on inmate attendance at this ser vice. In still other cases, the court has refused to apply the compelling inter est test because it concluded that the challenged government action simply didnot impose a substantial burden on the plaintiff's free exercise of religion. For example, in Bowen v. Roy (1986), a Native American family claimed that by assigning a Social Security number to theirdaughter, the federal government had robbed herof her spirit and, hence, offended their religiousbeliefs.The family argued that the Free ExerciseClause obligated the government to exempt themfrom the requirement, even though the girl need-ed a Social Security number in order to receivewelfare benefits.The court, however, rejected theparents' claim and ruled that the government's assignment of a Social Security number to theirdaughter did not obstruct the parents' ability to\"belie ve, express and exercise\" their religion. Inaddition, the court asserted, the Free Exercise Clause should not be read to limit the way thegovernment makes decisions about its internalaffairs - in this case, how it distributes benefits. THE SMITH DECISION THE COURT RETURNS TO THE BELIEF-ACTIONDISTINCTION As a result of the Supreme Court's repeated refusal to uphold fr ee exercise claims in vir tually all con- texts other than Yoder and a handful of unemploy- ment compensation cases, many legal scholarsbegan to w onder whether the distinction betw een religious belief and action established in the 19th- century polygamy cases (and thought to be over-turned in Sherber t)was still operati ve. In 1990, the Supreme Cour tseemed to settle this uncer tainty when it took a dramatic and unexpected step that largely r e-established that distinction. The case ,Emplo yment Division v. Smith ,involved a challenge br ought b ytwoNativeAmericans,Alfred Smith and Galen Black, who had been dismissed from their jobs as drug rehabilitation counselors because they had ingested the hallucinogen peyoteas part of a religious ritual in the Native American Majority: Kennedy O'Connor RehnquistScalia Stevens WhiteMin ority: Blackmun Brennan Marshall Supreme Court Case Employment Division v.Smith (1990) The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme Court page 10Church.The state of Oregon denied their applica- tion for unemployment benefits because they hadbeen fired for work-related misconduct. Smith andBlack took their case to the courts, where theyargued they should not be denied governmentbenefits because the cause of their dismissal - theuse of peyote for religious purposes - was protect-ed by the Free Exercise Clause. In an opinion that stunned many in the legal world, the court, by a vote of 6-3, rejected theNative Americans' claim. Justice Antonin Scalia'sopinion, joined by four other justices, concludedthat in most circumstances, generally applicablelaws that impose a burden on religious practice - such as Oregon's criminal prohibition on the use of peyote - are not subject to the compellinginterest test. Scalia' sopinion explicitly heark ened back to easoning Reynolds ,the first polygam ycase.The Fr ee Ex ercise Clause protects religious beliefs, he wr ote,but it does not insulate religiously motivated actions from laws, unless the laws single out r eligion for disf avored treatment. Such nondiscriminatory, general laws should be evaluated, the court ruled, under the \"rational basis\" standard. Under this standard, which is much more deferential to the government than the compelling interest test, a law is constitutional as long as there is a rational or legitimate reasonfor it; it does not need to further an important orcompelling government interest. Because Oregonhad a rational basis for outlawing peyote - it is ahallucinogenic drug - the court concluded thatthe Free Exercise Clause did not exempt thosewho used the drug for religious reasons. Scalia distinguished the court's ruling in Smith from prior decisions - such as Yoder and Cantwell -by arguing that in those cases, the right to free exercise had been bolstered by a second, compan-ion right under the Constitution. In Yoder,forinstance, free exercise had been linked to the right of parents to direct and control the upbringing oftheir children, he wrote. In Cantwell , he pointed out, free exercise had been connected to the rightof free expression.These combinations produce\"hybrid\" rights, Scalia asserted. Had this combina-tion of rights not been present, he argued, thecourt would have rejected those religious freedomclaims, just as it was now doing in Smith . The Smith opinion narrowed the impact of Sherbert and its progeny and limited the use of the compelling interest test to circumstances in which state law already allows for certain people to beexempt from the law's requirements for specificreasons. In Sherbert , for instance, exemptions were available to those seeking unemployment benefitsin South Carolina if they could demonstrate a jus-tifiable reason for refusing work. In cases involvingunemployment compensation or other contextswhere these types of exemptions are available, suchas zoning, the government must have a compellingreason when it rejects religious hardship as such a cause. But where the government does not rou-tinely grant exemptions to a law, such as in thecase of most cr iminal prohibitions, the Free page 11 The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme Court[The cour truled] that in most circumstances, generally applicable laws that impose a burden on religious practice - such as Oregon' scriminal prohibition on the use of pey ote - are not subject to the compelling interest test.Exercise Clause does not trigger any entitlement to a religious exemption. In the Smith decision, Scalia also asserted that those seeking exemptions from legal requirementsbased on religious grounds should look for redressin the political arena by petitioning the legislativeorexecutive branches of government. He stated that the courts are not the best venue for thoseseeking exemptions because each judge or courtcan have a different view of laws and rights, andthus produce inconsistent decisions. The court in Smith recognized that its new approach would sometimes make things difficultfor religious minorities, whose need for exemptionfrom general rules might well be ignored in thepolitical process. Scalia concluded, however, thatthis \"unavoidable consequence of democratic gov-ernment must be preferred to a system in whicheach conscience is a law unto itself or in whichjudges weigh the social importance of ... lawsagainst ... r eligious beliefs.\" The Smith opinion produced several forceful responses from other justices. In her concurrence,Justice Sandra Day O'Connor argued against the central thrust of the majority opinion and in favorof retaining the compelling interest test in freeexercise cases as a means of protecting religiousminorities. O'Connor concurred with the decisiononly because she agreed with the ultimate ruling inthe case; she believed that Smith and Black shouldlose precisely because the state of Oregon had acompelling interest in outlawing all uses of peyote. In his dissent, Justice Harry Blackmun (joined by Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall)agreed with O'Connor that the compelling inter-est test should be retained as a way for courts tomitigate \"the severe impact of a state's restrictions on the adherents of a minority religion.\" Unlike O'Connor, however, Blackmun argued that Smithand la ws to them. The Smith decision pr oduced a significant political protest fr om religious organizations and civil liber- ties groups such as the Amer ican Ci vil Liber ties Union.These critics saw the ruling as a serious retreat from judicial protection of free exercise rights.They argued that the decision would threaten the religious liberty of many people, and especially those of minority faiths, who engaged in religiously motivated acts that might conflict with general laws. THE CITY OF HIALEAH AND LOCKE DECISIONS REAFFIRMING THE SMITH DECISION Despite the political outcry over the Smith opinion, the cour treaffirmed the decision's basic principle page 12 The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme CourtThe Smith opinion narrowed the impact of Sherber tand its progen y and limited the use of the compelling interest test to circumstances in which state law already allows for certain people to be ex empt from the law' s requirements for specific reasons.three years later.The case, Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah (1993), involved a series of ordinances passed by the Florida city in response to the ritual practice of animal sacrifice by practitioners of Santeria, an Afro-Cuban religionthat mix es Roman Catholic and indigenous African traditions.The city's ordinances outlawed the sacri- fice or killing of animals in rituals or ceremonies,with specific ex emptions for K osher slaughter or other state-approved activities. The Supr eme Court's majority opinion was writ- ten by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who had votedwith the majority in Smith . In his opinion, Kennedy explicitly reaffirmed the principle in Smith that the Free Exercise Clause does not exempt religiously motivated acts from generallaws. Nevertheless, the court ruled against the city,finding that the Hialeah or dinances w erediscrimi- natory because they had been carefully crafted to prohibit only the mistreatment of animals for reli-gious pur poses. Indeed, the court concluded that the ordinances specifically discriminated against the practitioners of Santeria. For instance, the cityhad not outla wedkilling animals for secular r ea- sons or forbidden practices of animal slaughter perfor med to satisfy J ewish dietar ylaws. Because the ordinances were not general laws, but instead specifically discr iminated against the prac - titioner sof Santer ia,Kennedy wrote, the com-pelling interest standard should apply in this case. The court found that the city had no such interestthat could justify banning the Santerian practiceswithout similarly banning comparable religious orsecular practices. In separate concurring opinions, three of the jus- tices (David Souter, Harry Blackmun and SandraDay O'Connor) agreed with the rest of themajority that the Hialeah ordinances violated theFree Exercise Clause. But the three also urged thecourt to reconsider the rule in Smith , which, they asserted, was an incorrect interpretation of theFree Exercise Clause. In particular, they argued,the Smith ruling was insensitive to religious minorities, inconsistent with precedent and insuf- ficiently protective of religious freedom. Morethan a decade after City of Hialeah ,the courtwas confr onted with an example of a la w that singled out r eligion generally rather than a particular faith. In Locke v. Davey (2004), astudent challenged a Washington state higher education subsidy that specifically excluded those who w ere pursing a degree in theology. In a 7-2 decision, the courtruled that the pr ogram was constitutional. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Rehnquist argued that the government was free to include all major fields of study except theology or other devotional religious studies, on the grounds thatsuch studies frequently lead to a career in the cler-gy. Because the Free Exercise Clause significantly page 13Majority: Breyer GinsburgKennedyO'Connor RehnquistSouter StevensMinority: Scalia ThomasSupreme Court Case Locke v.Davey (2004) The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme CourtMajority: Blackmun KennedyO'Connor RehnquistScalia Souter StevensThomas Lukumi Babalu Aye v.City of Hialeah (1993) limits government regulation of the clergy, Rehnquist reasoned, the clause similarly permittedthe government to refrain from subsidizing thisfield of study. The Locke decision reflects the traditional judicial reluctance to interfere in governmental spendingdecisions.The dissenting justices (Antonin Scalia andClarence Thomas), however, criticized the majorityopinion in Locke for departing from the traditional requirement that the state be strictly neutralbetween religion and nonreligious philosophies. STATE COURT AND LEGISLATIVE RESPONSES TO THE SMITH DECISION In the y earsfollowing Smith ,the fear that the deci - sion would significantly curtail religious liberty prompted state cour ts and leg islatures, as well as the U.S. Congress, to act. Prior to this ruling, many state courts had followed the Supreme Court's more expansive view of religious liberty in inter- preting their own constitutions' religion clauses.After Smith , however, several state courts explicitly rejected the high court's new doctrine and contin-ued to employ some variation of the compellinginterest test in deciding religious liberty claims. For instance, in State v. Hershberger (1990), the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the right of theOld Order Amish to use silver reflecting tapeinstead of the orange tr iangle on their buggies.The that the Minnesota Constitution's pro-tection of r eligious liberty required the state toestablish that it had a compelling interest in regu- lating religiously motivated actions. Furthermore,the state was required to demonstrate that accom-modating religious practices would underminethose interests.The court concluded that the statewas unable to meet that requirement in this case.Similarly, in First Covenant Church v. City of Seattle (1992), the Washington state Supreme Court, adopting the compelling interest test for religiousliberty claims under the Washington stateConstitution, ruled in favor of a church that hadbeen prevented from making alterations to itsbuilding by the state's historic preservation laws. Legislatures, beginning with the U.S. Congress, also acted to counter what they perceived would be the negative impact of Smith . In 1993, a coali- tion of r eligious and ci vil liber ties g roups per suad- ed Cong ress to enact the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which attempted to codify the compelling inter est standar dthat the Supreme Court had applied in Sherber tand Yoder but had cur tailed in Smith .Specifically ,the statute prohibited the go vernment fr om b urdening r eli- giously motivated activity unless there is a com- pelling inter est to do so ,and unless that interest is being furthered in the least restrictive manner. In 1997, the constitutionality of RFRA came before the Supreme Court in City of Boerne v. Flores .The case involved a dispute between a T exas town and a local Catholic archbishop who wantedto enlarge a church building, which was a viola-tion of local historic preservation rules. In asweeping decision, the Supreme Court ruled thatRFRA was unconstitutional as applied to thestates.The foundation of the decision rested uponfederalism.The court concluded that Congresslacked the power to impose upon state and local governments the same compelling interest test thatthe court itself had repudiated in Smith and City of Hialeah .Among other things, the court pointed page 14 The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme Courtout that Congress had offered no evidence that state or local governments were systematicallyimperiling religious liberty. Such findings mighthave shown that the restoration of the pre- Smith compelling interest test was in fact necessary to maintain religious freedom against state and localgovernment intrusion. In 2006, the Supreme Court had an opportunity to apply RFRA in a case involving the federalgovernment. In Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal , the court unanimous- ly ruled that the statute protects the right of asmall religious sect to import and use a hallucino-genic substance in its r eligious rituals.The court also concluded that the government failed to show that the substance - hoasca tea - is dangerous tohuman health or is the subject of illicit commer - cial trafficking. Hence, the court ruled that the government, as required by RFRA, did not demonstrate a compelling inter est in den ying the religious group access to the tea. Adozen states ha vefollowed Congress' lead and enacted state RFRAs, which r equirethe state to justify burdens they place on religiously motivated actions. However, as of 2007, these state-level RFRAs have not had a significant impact on state court decisions concerning religious freedom. For example, in Freeman v. Department of Motor Vehicles (2006), a Florida appellate court ruled that the state RFRA did not protect the right of aMuslim woman to refuse to be photographedwithout her head covering if she wanted toobtain a driver's license.The Florida SupremeCourt declined to hear an appeal of the lowercourt's decision. Meanwhile, in 2000, three years after City of Boerne,Congress passed a significantly scaled- back version of RFRA, the Religious Land Useand Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). Asits name suggests, RLUIPA is focused on twokinds of state and local actions. First, the law regulates government decisions concerning theuses of land by religious organizations. Mostsuch decisions involve matters of zoning orissues of historic preservation. As of mid-2007,many cases involving this portion of RLUIPAwere working their way through the lowercourts. In addition, the act aims to protect thereligious freedom of prison inmates and otherpersons incarcerated in state or local institutions,such as jails or mental hospitals. So far, RLUIPA has weathered constitutional chal- lenges better than its predecessor. For instance, in Cutter v .Wilkinson (2005), the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the argument that the por- tion of the statute that covers prisoners and otherinstitutionalized per sons violates the Fir st Amendment' sEstablishment Clause, which forbids the go vernment fr om specially f avoring religion or promoting r eligious belief .The cour truled that Cong ress is free to insist that states receiving fed- eral financial assistance for their penal institutions page 15 The Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme CourtThe winding trail of decisions from Reynolds to Y oder to Smith to the legislative responses to Smith demonstrates that American courts and legislatures continue to struggle with the vexing question of whether and under what conditions religiously motivated actions should be ex empt from gener allyapplicable laws.respect the religious liberties of prisoners within the standards required by RLUIPA. Prison officialsandcourts must now apply RLUIPA, as interpret- ed in Cutter , on a case-by-case basis to the partic- ular religious freedom claims of prisoners andother institutionalized persons. (An upcomingbackgrounder will discuss in much greater detailRLUIPA and other legislative accommodations ofreligious liberty.) In light of the reasoning in Cutter , there is rea- son to believe that the court would similarlyuphold RLUIPA's land use provisions against aconstitutional challenge based on theEstab lishment Clause. But this result is by no means assured, since these provisions raise a unique blend of concerns about religious free-dom and federal interfer ence in local decisions concer ning the effect of land use on the sur- rounding comm unity.LOOKING AHEAD Ever since the Supreme Court first addressed a free exercise claim in the late 19th century, there hasbeen no clear resolution to the question of how tointerpret the Free Exercise Clause.The windingtrail of decisions from Reynolds to Yoder to Smith to the legislative responses to Smith demonstrates that American courts and legislatures continue to strug-gle with the vexing question of whether and underwhat conditions religiously motivated actions should be exempt from generally applicable laws. The per sistence of such a question is inevitable in areligiously pluralistic society with a wide variety of religious practices.As religious pluralism in theU.S. increases, these questions are bound to occur with increasing frequency.The answers, however,may prove elusive, requiring the courts to contin-ue to grapple with the precise meaning of theFree Exercise Clause.
