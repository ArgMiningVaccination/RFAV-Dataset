Read below for some of my faves. If you're anything like I was initially, you might be a bit skeptical in regards to a menstrual cup. But the more research I did, the more convinced I became that a menstrual cup has the capacity to optimize our period and how we care for our bodies (and the environment). Conventional period products (tampons, pads, etc.) are often expensive and contain known toxins, including aluminum, alcohol and fragrance additives. But perhaps worst of all, they're bleached in the production process, leaving behind traces of dioxins in our bodies that can lead to cramping, painful periods and hormone imbalances like endometriosis. Using a menstrual cup made with a non-toxic, ultra-soft silicone formula, eliminates the need for toxic period products and saves you money (1 cup can last up to 10 years) while cutting down on environmental waste in the process. I prefer the Saalt Menstrual Cup as it's super flexible and discreet. I forget about it once it's in there and only have to switch it out every 12 hours (following proper cleaning instructions and care of course). It's gently designed for people who might have had discomfort with firmer cups or any bladder/vaginal sensitivity, but still super effective (especially if you're active, like me). Last, but certainly not least, Saalt dedicates a portion of every menstrual cup purchase back to providing period care for many women who can't afford it or get access to it. It feels really awesome to purchase a product that supports our bodies, better periods, the environment and other women in the process. **Don't forget to use the code \"Lauren\" to save 15% off your first purchase. + A UNIQUELY FORMULATED MEDICINAL HERB BLEND All through my teens, twenties and even into my early thirties, I'd experience debilitating cramping and bloating so extreme I'd be relegated to the couch with Midol, a heating pad and sweatpants. So, I can only imagine how helpful Elix could be for so many women out there experiencing symptomatic periods or painful conditions like endometriosis, PCOS, fibroids or cysts month after month. After my own personal experience (not to mention the research Elix has done on the consumer experience, which includes a 93% improvement in period/PMS - related symptoms) I can confidently recommend Elix Cycle Balance to my clients and any woman in her reproductive years struggling with hormone-related imbalances or conditions, irregular or unhealthy cycles, or uncomfortable period symptoms as an effective way to reduce symptoms AND treat the underlying hormone imbalance causing them. I also love that Elix uses a unique and tailored approach to specifically address each woman's unique hormone imbalance (before purchasing product you're required to fill out a detailed quiz to ensure you're getting the right formula for your needs). They incorporate medicinal herbs into each product (including Vitex, White Peony, Ginger, Licorice, Skullcap, etc.) which are powerful on their own, but when blended together are 5-10x more potent than the individual herbs. The last thing I'll say about Elix is that it's a subscription service method that ships product out right before you need to begin taking, so it's super convenient and makes it easy to consistently use (I recommend using a minimum of 3 months to enjoy the range of benefits). **Don't forget to use code SOFRESH15 to get a 15% discount off your first three months! + A PULSE THERAPY WEARABLE DEVICE While I get that a \"pulse therapy device\" may sound a little out there, this technology has actually been used to treat pain for decades. Without getting too technical, the pulse therapy stimulates your nerves and reduces their ability to transmit pain signals to your brain. Because your brain can't register the pain, your period pain stops almost instantly. No signals = no pain. I've been using the OVIRA device (which I believe is the only one out there on the market to use this technology) and I love how easy it is to use. It's a completely pain-free process, and the wearable device makes it effective whether you're chilling on the couch or working at your desk. It's a drug-free option without any side effects that I'd absolutely recommend to any woman out there struggling with painful period cramps, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, adenomyosis, PCOS, fibroids or pelvic inflammatory disease. BOTTOMLINE While period pain, cramping and PMS is common, there are now plenty of safe, non-toxic options on the market that actually work, while reducing environmental waste and saving you money in the process.
