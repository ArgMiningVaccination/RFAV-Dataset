At this time of year, the herb garden will be in full bloom. You may catch the smell of lavender drifting in the breeze, hear the buzz of bees enjoying the lemon balm or smile at seeing the sweetest little white flowers on your Thyme. There are many benefits to adding, or already enjoying, a little herb oasis to your home. Here are a few of my favourites: - One of the best benefits to growing a herb garden is you will have fresh herbs at your fingertips to add to any recipes you enjoy creating. - You don't need a lot of space. Herbs can be grown in a small area of your garden, in pots or even on your windowsill, meaning everyone can enjoy the benefits of herbs. - The enjoyment of growing something from seed, seeing the first seedling peeping through the soil, then seeing it turn into a healthy plant which you can pick. It is such a wonderful feeling watching your little plant grow! - Many herbs you can grow can also be used for medicinal purposes. Rosemary can be infused in coconut oil to help with scalp psoriasis (I've made this myself and its done wonders for my scalp), or lavender sprigs can be picked and used in baths to help with insomnia. The list is endless. Please see a previous article for some great ways to enjoy the [powers of the summer herb garden](https://www.baseformula.com/blog/discover-the-powers-of-the-summer-herb-garden). - Spending time outside, digging, weeding, and picking herbs is great for our physical health as it keeps us active, but it also does wonders for our mental health, too. Mindfully picking herbs to add to a salad, drink in a tea or to infuse in a carrier oil will help you to stay in the present moment. Staying in the present stops us from feeling anxious and can help with any worries we may have. As well as the herb garden being wonderful for your mental wellbeing there are also many of those herbs used in aromatherapy and these essential oils can support your mental health, too. My top 'herb garden' essential oils to support mental health [Basil](https://www.baseformula.com/basil-linalol-essential-oil)is an extremely popular herb, and it is the same in aromatherapy thanks to the nervine actions found within the essential oil. Basil can support nervous tensions such a stress, mental unrest, and indecisiveness. [Clary Sage](https://www.baseformula.com/clary-sage-essential-oil)is one of the best essential oils to help with insomnia. It is a highly sedative oil so best used before bed. It is also extremely beneficial to help with PMS or perimenopause symptoms such as anxiety and mood swings. - Apple scented [Roman Chamomile](https://www.baseformula.com/chamomile-roman-essential-oil)smells delicious in your herb garden on a warm summer's day. As an essential oil it is a great choice to help balance emotions thanks to its calming and soothing properties. [Dill Seed](https://www.baseformula.com/dill-seed-essential-oil)is a sweet-smelling essential oil. Although its plant power is often used for digestive problems, it can also be beneficial if you are suffering from nerves. [Geranium](https://www.baseformula.com/geranium-essential-oil), although not a herb, is a great addition to any garden. Geranium is one of my favourite essential oils to support both the nervous and endocrine systems. It can help to balance hormones, ease mood swings and irritability. It also happens to have a beautiful sweet and floral scent. Summer in a bottle! - A herb garden would not be complete without [Lavender](https://www.baseformula.com/lavender-french-essential-oil). It is often used to help with sleep disorders, but it can also be beneficial if you are suffering from anxiety, depression, and other stress conditions. [Melissa](https://www.baseformula.com/melissa-true-essential-oil)(more commonly knowns as Lemon Balm) is Greek for \"honey bee\" and anyone who grows Melissa will know the bees absolutely love this lemon-scented herb. It is my top oil for treating anxiety and grief. A must for your herb garden but also for your aromatherapy collection. [Peppermint](https://www.baseformula.com/peppermint-uk-essential-oil)has an uplifting and refreshing aroma. A great essential oil to use to help focus your mind if you are suffering from mental fatigue. [Rosemary](https://www.baseformula.com/rosemary-essential-oil)is found in many herb gardens and as an essential oil it can be used to help with fatigue. It can also be used to help boost concentration and to aid in those moments of brain fog. [Sweet Marjoram](https://www.baseformula.com/marjoram-sweet-essential-oil)essential oil has such a beautiful herbaceous aroma. It is wonderfully relaxing, thanks to its sedative action and can be useful if you suffer from broken sleep. [Sweet Thyme](https://www.baseformula.com/thyme-sweet-linalol-essential-oil)is a light, mild and gentle essential oil. It is an excellent nerve tonic that can be effective in treating stress and nervous exhaustion. - Although, Calendula (Marigold) oil is not an essential oil, I felt I had to add it to my list. Every year I make sure this vibrant orange flower can be found in my herb garden. There is something quite magical about seeing a marigold flower. [Calendula oil](https://www.baseformula.com/calendula-carrier-oil)is beautifully nourishing and soothing for the skin and can be beneficial for several skin disorders.
