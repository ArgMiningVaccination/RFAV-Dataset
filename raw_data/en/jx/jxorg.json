Rules for abbreviations 1.1 Abbreviations should be avoided if at all possible, but in the event of abbreviations being utilised, only those approved by the Quality & Clinical Care Directorate and contained within this document are permitted. 1.2 If an abbreviation is used that is not contained within this document the full term used, followed by the abbreviation in brackets, should be written on each side of each page. 1.3 All abbreviations must be written in Block Capitals (e.g. MI - Myocardial infarction). Contractions can be expressed as a mixture of higher and lower case. Contractions used in this document omit the end of a word and are terminated with a full stop (e.g., Ausc. - Auscultation). 1.4 The following must neVeR be abbreviated. never abbreviate decisions Any decision regarding regarding resuscitation of resuscitation of a patient must a patient always be written in full and signed. A decision of such gravity must never be abbreviated. never abbreviate drug Drug names must always be names written in full and shall never be abbreviated under any circumstances. never use R and L Right and left must be written in full. The exception to this rule is when right or left is contained within an abbreviation, e.g. LIF - left iliac fossa. - 5 - +++, < less than and Accepted grading systems > greater than should be should only be used avoided except where they are part of an official grading system (i.e. urinalysis results) never use these symbols +ve and -ve are not acceptable. +ve and -ve These can be abbreviated to Pos. and Neg. any reference to the service The service user/patient's given user/patient must never be name should always be used. abbreviated abbreviations must never be used on a consent form abbreviations must never be used in the completion of incident report forms 1.5 Laboratory tests may be abbreviated on typed reports but only approved abbreviations contained within this document may be hand-written in service user/patient healthcare records. If an abbreviation is used that is not contained within this document the full term used, followed by the abbreviation in brackets, should be written on each side of each page. 1.6 Abbreviations pre-printed or typed on Health Service Executive documentation (and on computer) can remain unchanged, as they are generally understood. An explanatory footnote added to the document, prior to reprinting, in order to clarify the meaning of typed abbreviations is necessary. 1.7 To deliver best practice it is essential that all of the abbreviation rules and recommendations apply to electronic clinical information also. With the move within the healthcare service to the development and delivery of integrated Electronic Patient Records, healthcare providers - 6 - must endeavour to produce systems, which will contain and produce no abbreviations. In the interim: 1.7.1 Current systems can remain unchanged as they are already approved and agreed locally. 1.7.2 When current systems are upgraded or changed abbreviations must be omitted. 1.7.3 Information printed or shared from current systems must: l Contain no abbreviations l If they contain abbreviations a footnote must be added that clarifies the meaning of the abbreviations. 1.8 References to referrals or discussions with other health professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses, health and social care professionals) must state their full name; title and bleep number if applicable (e.g. seen by 'Physio or Surgical IOC' is not a substitute for their name). 1.9 International chemical symbols are acceptable in clinical documentation e.g. Fe Al except in prescriptions and/or medication charts. 1.10 In designating time in clinical documentation the 24 hour clock must be used. 1.11 No abbreviations to be used in documentation or correspondence which is used for transfer, discharge or external referral letters. 1.12 This document is intended to reduce error and confusion by providing the generally accepted or preferred abbreviations and acronyms that have been approved by the Quality & Clinical Care Directorate. - 7 - 2.

Where possible prescribe medications , including intravenous fluids, using approved generic name , where this is not possible the drug name used must be on the local approved list of trade name drugs except in the case of multi-ingredient preparations and modified release formulations when the brand names must be used. note : Always document patient drug allergies or idiosyncratic reactions and refer to documented allergies and reactions before prescribing any drug. Drug names must never be abbreviated under any circumstances table 1 Checklist when Prescribing YOuR HANDWRITINg MuST BE CLeaR & LegIbLe uSINg uN -JOINED LOWER CASE TExT OR BLOCk CAPITALS Allergies Always check and document Drug Names Never abbreviate drug names Prescribing use approved (generic) names where possible.

In the case of preparations to be taken \"as required\", always specify the minimum dose interval e.g. Paracetamol tablets 500mg 2 every 6 hours p.r.n.

For drugs to be administered only on specific days of the week then those days must always be written in full. example 1 A Prescription for once weekly Methotrexate must state the drug name, dose and specific weekly day for drug administration, with no abbreviations other than the route, e.g. Methotrexate 2.5mg P.O. once weekly on Wednesdays. example 2 A prescription for thrice weekly Erythropoietin Beta must state the drug name, dose and the three specific days per week for drug administration, with no abbreviations other than the route, e.g. Erythropoietin Beta 2,000 units I.V . three times weekly on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. - 11 - 2.4 tIme abbReVIatIonS The following abbreviations are applicable with regard to time and rates of administration of medicines: table 5 abbreviation meaning h Hour Mins.

Each hospital is, however, strongly encouraged to have a specific local policy on Standard Times for Drug Administration. table 8 abbreviation meaning q.d.s./q.i.d. Four times daily, this ideally means every six hours. It is generally impractical to administer any medicine at strictly six hourly intervals, as the service user/patient would have to be awakened. t.d.s./t.i.d. Three times daily, this ideally means every eight hours. b.d./b.i.d. Twice daily, this ideally means every twelve hours. For drugs that are prescribed twice daily and are not intended for administration at twelve hourly intervals, the specific instructions must be included on the prescription i.e. Diuretics 1 b.d. The dose must read, as appropriate, 1 in the morning and 1 at lunchtime etc. - 14 - abbreviation meaning once Daily This means every 24 hours. For drugs that are intended for administration at a specific time the prescription must reflect this fact and not be prescribed simply as once daily i.e. diuretics in the morning, hypnotics at night. Care must be taken when a drug is prescribed once daily that the service user/patient will take the drug at the same time each day or else compliance problems can arise. Drugs and meal times Dietary considerations must be taken into account when drugs are being prescribed/ administered. If drugs are best taken on an empty stomach they must be given at least 30 minutes before the next mealtime. If drugs are best taken with or after meals then they must be given at meal times. It is generally more important that the dietary considerations take precedence over strict adherence to the optimum time of administration. - 15 - 3. aPPRoVeD abbReVIatIonS LISt foR USe InHeaLtHCaRe ReCoRDS misc .
