But if you are experiencing repeated breakouts in your adulthood, then it could be a cause of worry. \"Acne is a chronic inflammatory condition that is mainly seen in the adolescent age group. However, a variant called adult-onset acne occurs predominantly in people above 25 years,\" says Dr Kiran Godse, a dermatologist with over 31 years of experience. In simple terms, the skin issue is called \"recurring acne\", which appears again and again in the same spot on your face and often turns out to be a cystic or nodular type. Cystic And Nodular Acne Cystic acne is a type of acne that is inflammatory and causes pain. These pus-filled pimples form deep under the skin. On the other hand, nodular acne looks like a small bump. These are swollen pimples that form deep under the surface of your skin and can also turn red as the surrounding area gets inflamed. Dr Godse explains that this happens when you get lesions repeatedly at the same place and such breakouts can lead to scarring if not properly evaluated and treated. What Causes Such Severe Acne? There could be several reasons behind this skin issue. But stress, smoking, unhealthy eating habits, and alcohol could play a major role in such breakouts. According to Dr Godse, excess sebum production (seborrhea) \u2014 meaning, your skin produces an oily substance in excess mainly due to hormonal disturbances \u2014 not following a skincare routine or even a genetic predisposition could lead to the onset of [recurring acne](/topic/recurring-acne). Why Is Your Skin Oily? Consumption of sugar, refined flour, white bread and bakery products as well as food that have high glycemic index can lead to your skin producing excessive oil, which then results in breakouts. If the first thing you do after noticing acne returning is Google for solutions, then you need to stop right now. Else it might lead to DIY homemade masks or products suggested by influencers, and you may just end up harming your skin more, warn experts. For a person with acne-prone skin, turning to DIY masks for help can prove to be especially harmful as many of the ingredients used in these masks can be potential irritants to the skin. This can result in acne flares. Even scrubbing should be avoided by people with acne- prone skin as it facilitates the spread of acne-causing bacteria and creates microtears that can again give acne flares, Dr Godse explains. Time To Seek Help Such sort of acne leaves behind scars and pigmentation, and your average OTC topical creams may not be able to take care of it. In order to prevent or repair skin damage due to acne, you should consult a dermatologist in the initial stages itself. Apart from that, doctors also suggest maintaining a basic skincare routine tailor-made by a dermatologist. But that alone should not be your solution to this problem. As the issue runs deeper than the first layer of your skin, you also need to check and fix what is going on inside your body. First, start maintaining a healthy lifestyle. A lot of times, [hormonal imbalance](/topic/hormonal-imbalance)results in several issues in the texture and health of your skin. Fixing your diet can mostly fix this. Can Diet Fix Acne Breakouts Caused By Hormonal Imbalance? The answer is yes. \"Hormonal acne happens due to high levels of androgen, i.e., male hormone which leads to excess sebum production at the base of the hair follicles, which in turn leads to excess oil in the pores and bacteria that leads to inflammation,\" Kandwal says. One of the major causes of this imbalance is bad lifestyle and eating habits. Experts say if you become more cautious of what is on your plate, it can eventually give you better skin. \"Opting for anti-inflammatory omega-3 fat sources, such as fatty fish and chia seeds, over potentially inflammatory omega-6-rich fat sources like canola and soybean oils may decrease acne symptoms,\" says Simrun Chopra, Deep Health Coach and Founder of Nourish with Sim. Body-Mind Balance Apart from dermatologist consultation and diet change, you also need to maintain a balance between the body and mind. Chopra suggests regular workout. \"When we exercise, the blood is pumped through our body, working out heart muscles and circulating blood and oxygen. That means all of our body's cells, including skin cells, are nourished by this blood flow, leading to improved vitality and more effective cellular repair and replacement,\" she says. But proper hygiene before and after a workout is also a must. Gorey suggests limiting sun and pollution exposure and keeping your fingers away from the pimples. You can also try yoga, meditation and massages. How To Curb Junk Cravings? WFH puts us a lot closer to our fridge and snack cabinets, which isn't good for our skin or our body.
