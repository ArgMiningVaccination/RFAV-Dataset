Our treatments: may include nutrition counseling, herbal medicine, therapeutic use of nutrient supplements, exercise recommendations, and stress reduction. We may recommend pharmaceutical medications when necessary and can effectively integrate them with natural therapies. Our treatments are effective in treating a wide variety of conditions without the need for additional intervention. However, we will refer you to a specialist whenever necessary. Our comprehensive approach: to your health takes time, which is why first office visits are scheduled for 90 minutes. Return visits range from 15-60 minutes depending on your needs. You will be with the doctor for the entire time. We can serve as your primary care doctor but are also able to function within an integrated framework, complementing the treatments used by other members of your health care team. The result is a patient-centered approach that strives to provide the most appropriate treatment for you as an individual. We always recommend what we feel is the best treatment modality but will respect your individual autonomy in making your own educated medical decisions. Locations: Mt. Shasta: 1180 S. Mt.
