Information for Parents Children through 18 years of age who meet at least one of the following criteria may be eligible to receive VFC vaccines: - Enrolled in Medicaid. - Not insured: A child who has no health insurance coverage. - American Indian or Alaska Native: As defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1603). - Under-insured: A child who has commercial (private) health insurance but the coverage does not include vaccines, a child whose insurance covers only selected vaccines (VFC-eligible for non-covered vaccines only), or a child whose insurance caps vaccine coverage at a certain amount. Once that coverage amount is reached, the child is categorized as under-insured. Under-insured children are eligible to receive VFC vaccine only through a Federally Qualified Health Center, Rural Health Clinic, or deputized local health departments.

Your primary health care provider may be participating in the VFC program, but has elected not to be listed on the IDPH website.
