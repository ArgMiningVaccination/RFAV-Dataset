But it was an occasion to get our message to millions of people, so I decided to accept.\" Wallis's [address](http://www.beliefnet.com/blogs/godspolitics/2006/12/jim-wallis-we-need-greater-moral.html), touted as the first such weekly radio address by \"a non-partisan religious leader,\" began with a disclaimer: \"I want to be clear that I am not speaking for the Democratic Party, but as a person of faith who feels the hunger in America for a new vision of our life together and sees the opportunity to apply our best moral values to the urgent problems we face. I am not an elected official or political partisan, but a religious leader who believes that real solutions must transcend partisan politics.\" Wire stories on the address focused on Wallis's calls for action on corruption, Iraq, poverty, the environment, and abortion. 2. [Faith-based initiative goes to the Supreme Courtin a way](#churchstate) [Hein v. Freedom from Religion Foundation](http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/004160.php) is a [case](http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2006/12/cert-granted-on-taxpayer-standing-to.html) about Bush's faith-based initiative, but, as the First Amendment Center's [Tony Mauro](http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/analysis.aspx?id=17851) points out, it \"does not directly test the meaning of the establishment clause itself.\" Instead, it's a case about standing. Right now, Hein isn't about whether government-sponsored conferences for the faith-based initiative violated the First Amendment, but whether the Freedom from Religion Foundation can bring a suit accusing the conferences of doing so. Mauro explains: Under the traditional doctrine of standing, you can't challenge a government program you don't like just because your taxes or some infinitesimal fraction of your taxes paid for the program. To reduce litigation against the government for every general grievance, courts have required instead that taxpayers show they have suffered real, specific harm or will soon to a legally protected interest from the program they don't like, before they can challenge it in court. But a Supreme Court ruling 38 years ago made an exception to that high standard when a taxpayer alleges that a government program violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment (\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\"). The Hein case, which the Supreme Court agreed Friday to consider, \"could prompt a review, if not a narrowing, of that exception, which critics say has made it too easy to mount establishment-clause lawsuits against government efforts to accommodate religion,\" Mauro says. That is very important, he says, \"because standing is a threshold issue in every establishment-clause case.\" 3. [Minced oaths](#quran) So you've probably already read about [Dennis Prager](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/DennisPrager/2006/11/28/america,_not_keith_ellison,_decides_what_book_a_congressman_takes_his_oath_on)'s complaints that Keith Ellison will use a Qur'an instead of a Bible for his ceremonial oath of office when he becomes a U.S. Representative from Minnesota. The [American Family Association](http://www.afa.net/aa112806_2.asp) wants Congress to \"pass a law making the Bible the book used in the swearing-in ceremonies of Representatives and Senators.\" Prager's colleague at Salem Radio Network, Michael Medved, has been critical of Prager's remarks. (Prager and Medved are both Jews.) And hundreds of [bloggers](http://www.technorati.com/search/Prager%20Ellison) are discussing the subject. But if you're going to hit one place, check out The Point, the blog of Prison Fellowship's BreakPoint. [Travis McSherley](http://thepoint.breakpoint.org/2006/11/so_help_me_god.html) and [Roberto Rivera](http://thepoint.breakpoint.org/2006/11/re_so_help_me_g.html) are [at odds](http://thepoint.breakpoint.org/2006/11/re_so_help_me_g_1.html); the latest post suggests that in the official swearing in (rather than in ceremonial photo ops for family and supporters), no holy book is used. In other words, this story is a non-story. So who's up for debating whether taking an oath of office is itself [unbiblical](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%205:36-37;&version=47;)? 4. [Pastor pleads guilty to felonies, denies his critics Communion](#crime) Here's one of those stories that's so outrageous, it's amazing it's not getting more circulation. Macedonia Baptist Church senior pastor John Henry Walker confessed to nine felony charges last week, including tax evasion, bank fraud, and lying to federal authorities. Then he preached on Sunday. And then, according to [The Charlotte Observer](http://www.charlotte.com/mld/observer/news/local/16158653.htm), he denied Communion to church members that had been publicly critical of him when his misdeeds were made public. 5. [Protest called off after Mark Driscoll apologizes](#people) Mars Hill Church pastor Mark Driscoll has been under a fair bit of [scrutiny](http://www.thefalcononline.com/story/5606) after writing a Ted Haggard-related blog post on the role of pastors and their wives in avoiding sexual temptation. There was, in fact, a protest planned for Sunday at his Seattle church. But in a meeting with [protest organizers](http://www.endfundamentalism.org/) and other local church leaders, Driscoll apologized, and the protest was called off. \"My theological convictions, even the most controversial ones, are as unwavering as ever,\" Driscoll says in a [new blog post](http://theresurgence.com/mark_driscoll_2006-12-01_count_it_all_joy). \"But I also learned that as my platform has grown, so has my responsibility to speak about my convictions in a way that invites other people to experience charity from me, which means inflammatory language and such need to be scaled back. I was also sad and sorry to hear that various things I have said over the years have been received very personally by some people who felt personally attacked.\" [Quote of the day](#warren) \"I've got two friends here: a Republican and a Democrat. Why? Because you've got to have two wings to fly.\" Rick Warren, telling attendees at his Saddleback Church AIDS conference that they should listen to both Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) and Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.).
