It aims to improve one's health and well-being by creating a balance between mind, body and spirit through an assessment of lifestyle. In Ayurveda, an individual is made up of [five primary elements](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vata-dosha-pitta-dosha-kapha-dosha#:~:text=Ayurvedic%20medicine%20is%20based%20on,vata%2C%20kapha%2C%20and%20pitta.): earth, air, fire, water and ether (space). These five elements combine together to create the three bodily humours known as 'doshas', which make up a person's constitution and play active roles in sustaining the processes of the body. The three doshas are called Vatta, Pitta and Kapha. Vatta is thought to be responsible for our movement and represented traditionally by ether and air. Pitta is thought to be responsible for our digestion and transformation and is represented traditionally by fire and water. And finally Kapha, which is thought to be responsible for our stamina and structure, is traditionally represented by water and earth. How does Ayurvedic treatment work? Ayurveda aims to correct the dosha imbalances with natural therapies and treatments based on herbal preparations, diet modification, massages, meditation, yoga and purification, which all help to eliminate impurities, boost the immune system and lower stress and worry. Your Ayurveda Health Practitioner will first establish the balance of your individual doshas before tailoring a treatment to your needs. In-spa therapies will be complemented by diet and lifestyle tips in harmony with your dosha constitution to strengthen your body further. Do you have to completely change your lifestyle to follow Ayurveda? Is Ayurveda safe? Yes. Ayurveda is a natural, holistic practice so there is little to no risk of damage being done to your body. As it concentrates on diet and lifestyle changes for the foundations of good health it means you can take more control over your health and well-being outside of the treatment room. As with any healthcare, it is important that you receive the right advice for getting treatments from a trained clinician and have regular follow-ups. Ayurveda is practical and flexible, reliant upon the patients themselves to achieve the results they want through being disciplined. On an Ayurveda [spa holiday](/spa-holidays), you will mostly benefit from internal ayurvedic treatments, such as specialised foods and herbs, and external ayurvedic massages and meditation. To get the most out of Ayurveda, be sure to have a consultation that will advise you on the best practises to continue when you go home.
