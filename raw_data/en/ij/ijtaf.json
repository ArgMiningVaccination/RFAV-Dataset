The courses are \u00a3100 for 12 hours tuition (including a 25-page handbook) but you can purchase a \u00a350 gift voucher towards the cost by emailing [info@homeopathyforliving.co.uk](mailto:info@homeopathyforliving.co.uk) [https://www.homeopathyforliving.co.uk/](https://www.homeopathyforliving.co.uk/) Books for everyone Specialist publishers Saltire Books have a wide range of homeopathy titles which cater for all readers, from professional homeopaths to those who are just curious about complementary medicine. A gift to Homeopathy UK Given the cost-of living-crisis, many people are choosing to make charitable gifts - either themselves or on behalf of someone - instead of buying gifts this year. We rely entirely on donations to continue funding our charitable clinics - which provide free treatment for those in need - and even the smallest amount can make a big difference. [Donate Now - "}
