The Commission on Human Medicines gives independent advice to ministers about the safety, quality, and efficacy of medicines. The Commission is supported in its work by Expert Advisory Groups that cover various therapeutic areas of medici ne. MHRA is accredited by NICE to provide Drug Safety Update. Further information can be found on the NICE Evidence Search portal: www.evidence.nhs.uk/ To subscribe to monthly email alerts of Drug Safety Update see: https://www.gov.uk/government /organisations/medicines -and- healthcare -products -regulatory - we inform he althcare professionals that chloramphenicol eye drops can be safely administered to children younger than 2 years when indicated after concerns were raised about exposure to boron (page 2). Following a review of the available toxicological data and a calcu lation of daily exposure to boron from a typical dosing regimen, we have concluded that the balance between the benefits and risks of chloramphenicol eye drops containing borax or boric acid remains positive for children, including those aged 0 to 2 years. Next, we remind healthcare professionals to ask patients whether they are taking any herbal or homeopathic medicines if an adverse drug reaction is suspected, and to report any suspicions about these products to the Yellow Card scheme. We also ask health care professionals to remind patients to check that a herbal or homeopathic medicine is licensed and to follow the advice included in the patient information. On page 8 we link to recent MHRA guidance for specialists on monitoring arrangements for oral retinoid medicines while remote appointments continue. On page 10 we summarise recent advice relating to COVID -19 vaccines that has been published since the June 2021 issu e of Drug Safety Update, including revisions made to the information for healthcare professionals and information for UK vaccine recipients for the COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine following a thorough review of extremely rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID -19 vaccination. And on page 13 we include recent letters, recalls and notifications sent to healthcare professionals about medicines and medical devi ces. 2 \u00a9 Crown Copyright 20 21 Chloramphenicol eye drops containing borax or boric acid buffers: use in children younger than 2 years Following a review of the available toxicological data and a calculation of daily exposure to boron from a typical dosing regimen, we have concluded that the balance between the benefits and risks of chloramphenicol eye drops containing borax or boric acid remains positive for children aged 0 to 2 years. Chloramphenicol eye drops can be safely administered to children aged 0 to 2 years where antibiotic eye drop treatment is indicated. Advice for healthcare professionals : some licences for chloramphenicol eye drop products containing borax or boric acid buffers were recently updated to restrict use in children younger than 2 years of age to reflect warnings on maximum daily limits for boron exposure we have reviewed the available evidence an d sought independent expert advice to understand whether there is a risk for children aged 0 to 2 years when using these products within the licensed indication, for what is likely to be a short period of time our review has concluded that the benefits of chloramphenicol eye drops containing borax or boric acid outweigh the potential risks for children, including those aged 0 to 2 years a typical regimen of one drop, applied typically 3 to 4 times a day, to bot h eyes, would result in a daily exposure well below the safety limit for children aged 0 to 2 years (see notes on dosing schedule in section on Findings of review) advise parents and caregivers that chloramphenicol eye drops remain an important medicine for children when antibiotic eye treatment is indicated and that they have been used safely for many years - see Advice to provide to parents and carers report the product information for affected chloramphenicol products is being updated to reflect the revised advice and remove restrictions for use in infants - in the meantime we ask healthcare professionals to reassure parents and carers that these products can be safely given to children aged 0 to 2 years as prescribed Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to parents and carers : eye infections (conjunctivitis) are very common in babies and infants and it is important they are treated properly chloramphenicol eye drops are an important medicine for treating bacterial eye infections in children and have been used safely for many years some eye drops contain borax or boric acid, which are sources of boron - these ingredients are included as buffer s to make sure the medicine is not too acidic or alkaline and is comfortable when administered to the eye although concerns have been raised about boron and a possible effect on future fertility, these products can be safely given to children younger than 2 years as advised by a doctor or other prescriber experts have advised that the amount of liquid that can be absorbed through the eyes of young children and the way these products are prescribed mean that the daily exposure to children would be well belo w the calculated safety limits 3 \u00a9 Crown Copyright 20 21 1 EMA. SANTE - 2017_11668. Published 9 October 2017; updated November 2019. 2 EMA. Boric acid and borate used as excipients . Published 9 October 2017. Review of the interpretation of EU guidance on boric acid and borates as excipients Excipient guidance In October 2017 , warnings for boric acid (and borates) were introduced into the European Commission guideline for excipients in the labelling and package leaflet of medicines containing boron.1,2 Marketing authorisation holders were asked to update their product information (Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient information Leaflet) in line with the 2017 guidance over a period of time; and this occurred in the UK last year. The European g uidance requires the addition of strong warnings not to give children aged 0 to 2 years products if an exposure greater than 1 milligram (mg) of boron a day is exceeded due to concerns around impaired fertility. MHRA review With restrictions introduced on the use of some products in children younger than 2 years, concerns were raised by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and other professional organisations regarding the applicability of these warnings and restrictions for very young children and the lack of suitable alternatives to chloramphenicol eye drops. We therefore undertook a review of the interpretation of the EU guidance on boric acid and borates as relates to children aged 0 to 2 years. The MHRA reviewed the available quality, clinical and toxicological evidence and sought independent expert advice f rom the Paediatric Medicines Expert Advisory Group of the C ommission on Human Medicines to understand the risk for infants when these products are used within the licensed indication for what is likely to be a short period of time. Findings of the review The European guidance threshold for boron is based on a pr egnancy -related effect (reduced fetal weights). Furthermore, the uncertainty factors used in the derivation of the permitted daily exposure (PDE) are based on toxicokinetic and bodyweight data from pregnant rats and humans. Therefore, our review concluded that the current PDE is not relevant to children aged 0 to 2 years. Based on studies conducted in animals, the most sensitive toxicological effect potentially relevant to infants is reproductive toxicity (adverse effects on fertility). This data was generated in adult animals, not juvenile animals, therefore the relevance to the developing reproductive tract and long -term effects on fertility are unknown. There are no data indicating clinical relevance to adults and children at present, therefore the assumption of potential risk to future fertility of infants is hypothetical. In terms of the exposures associated with the use of chloramphenicol eye drops, there are adequate safety margins in place for adverse effects on fertility and for exposures assoc iated with reduced fetal weights, an endpoint not considered relevant to infants. Levels of boron in chloramphenicol eye drops vary by product, but around 0.12mg of boron per drop might be present (based on a boron concentration of around 3mg/ml and a drop size of about 40 microlitres (L)). Boron exposure calculated using the full amount per drop appears to be an overestimate. Administering eye drops in young children is difficult due to lack of co -operation and potential crying during administration. Because of this, some liquid will be blinked out. Based on expert opinion, the maximum volume that can be accommodated in the conjunctival sac of a child younger than 2 years is between 10L and 20L. 4 \u00a9 Crown Copyright 20 21 3 BNF for Children (BNF -C). Accessed June 2021. Expert advice on current clinical practice suggest s a typical regimen of one drop administered, applied typically 3 to 4 times a day to both eyes, which would result in a daily exposure well below 1mg per day, even if 100% absorption is assumed. For severe eye infections, the BNF-C states a dose of one drop, every 2 hours (with frequency reduced as the infection is controlled).3 This would result in a daily exposure over the limit of 1mg per day threshold for infan ts younger than 2 years assuming the maximum dose (24 drops) is administered and 100% absorption occurs. Expert opinion is that it is unlikely that the maximum dose will be achieved as the drops will likely be only administered during waking hours and the high dose is for a short duration of a few days. Conclusion of the review Given the toxicological data and the calculation of daily exposure from a typical dosing regimen, it has been concluded that the benefit -risk balance of chloramphenicol eye drops containing boron or boric acid remains positive for children aged 0 to 2 years. The product information for affected chloramphenicol products will be updated shortly to reflect the revised advice that these products can be safely administered to children aged 0 to 2 years. We have requested the removal of restrictions and associated warnings about boron exposure in children aged 0 to 2 years from the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflets) for UK chloramphenicol eye drop products. To ensure continuity of supply, we will not be recalling products that are accompanied by Patient Information Leaflets with previous warnings. As such, for a short time, we ask healthcare professionals to reassure concerned parents and caregivers that chloramphenicol eye drops can be used safely when prescribed for use in their children as long as the instructions for use are followed. Report suspected reactions on a Yellow Card Report su spected adverse drug reactions or adverse incidents involving chloramphenicol eye drops to the Yellow Card Scheme . Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are asked to submit reports using the Yellow Card scheme electronically using: the Yellow Card website the Yellow Card app; download from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store some clinical IT systems for healthcare professionals (EMIS, SystmOne, Vision, MiDatabank, and Ulysses ) When reporting please provide as much information as possible, including information about batch numbers, medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, treatment dates, and product brand name.

Remin d patients to check that a herbal or homeopathic medicine is licensed and to follow the advice included in the patient information. Advice for healthcare professionals: be vigilant for suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of herbal and homeopathic medicines and interactions with other medicines and report suspicions to the MHRA's Yellow Card scheme (see sect ion on page 6 for what to include in reports) if an adverse reaction is suspected, ask patients whether they are taking any herbal or homeopathic medicines and include a full list of medicines in the Yellow Card report enquire if patients are taking herbal or homeopathic medicines during routine medicine reviews and remind them to check they are using licensed products (see advice to provide to patients below) remind patients to read the safety information provided in the patient information fo r herbal and homeopathic medicines, including when to seek medical advice Advice for healthcare professionals to provide to patients: to ensure a product has been licensed by the MHRA and meets the required standards of quality, safety, and patient inform ation: o check for the Traditional Herbal Registration (THR) Certificati on Mark and THR number on the label of traditional herbal medicines (some herbal medicines have a product licence, shown by a product licence (PL) number) o check for the Simplified Homeopathic Registration (HR) or National Rules Authorisation (NR) number on the label of homeopathic medicines always read the patient information provided with a herbal or homeopathic medicine to ensure that it is suitable for you and that you know how to use it safely if you suspect you have had an adverse reaction to a herba l or homeopathic medicine, you can report this to your doctor or pharmacist, or directly to the MHRA's Yellow Card Scheme Yellow Card reporting for herbal and homeopathic medicines The Yellow Card scheme is vital in helping the MHRA to monitor the safety of all medicines in the UK, including herbal and homeopathic medicines. 6 \u00a9 Crown Copyright 20 21 1 Schmoll S, Romanek K, and others . Clinical Toxicology. 2021. 1 -3. Herbal and homeopathic medicines are avai lable from outlets such as pharmacies, retail stores, online shops or supplied by herbal or homeopathic practitioners and only some of these are licensed by the MHRA. Here we provide several examples of why it is important that we monitor both licensed and unlicensed herbal and homeopathic medicines in order to protect patient safety. Yellow Card reporting has identified many important safety issues for herbal medicines, for example, interactions between St John's wort and hormonal contraceptives and antiepilepti c medicines , which were unknown before being reported. In addition, our vigilance of herbal products has led to warnings regarding the use of Butterbur ( Petasites hybridus ) products. Butterbur contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which can cause serious adverse effects such as liver damage and organ failure. The MHRA has previously published a safety alert advising consumers not to take unlicensed Butterbur herbal remedies. This advice remains unchanged. Although homeopathic medicines are sometimes diluted to contain only a few molecules of active ingredient, a recent study highlighted a manufacturing error for a homeopathic medicine that resulted in an accidental atropine overdose and hospitalisation in a patient in Germany.1 Although this occurred outside of the UK, it is an example of the need to consider these medicines in patients who have an adverse reaction. Who advises the MHRA on herbal and homeopathic medicines? The independent Herbal Medicines Advisory Committee (HMAC) and Advisory B oard on the Registration of Homeopathic products (ABRHP) advise the MHRA and Ministers on the safety, quality and patient information for traditional herbal and homeopathic medicines. HMAC and ABRHP review safety issues identified for traditional herbal and homeopathic products via the reporting of Yellow Card reactions and advise on changes to the safety information for UK licensed products when required. Knowing whether a herbal or homeopathic medicine is licensed in the UK For herbal medicines, patients should check for: Traditional Herbal Registration Certification Mark Traditional Herbal Registration (THR) number Or a Product Licence (PL) number For homeopathic medicines, patients should check for a: A Simplified Homeopathic Registration (HR) number Or a National Rules Authorisation (NR) number Choosing a product that is licensed means that it meets the required standards of quality, safety, and patient information 7 \u00a9 Crown Copyright 20 21 2 Bracchi RC, Tseliou F, and others. British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 2021; 1 -5 Report suspected adverse reactions to herbal or homeopathic medicines A recent study of a cohort of people in Wales showed that fewer than 1 in 3 participants knew that they could report an adverse reaction to a herbal medicine or homeopathic medicine to the Yellow Card scheme.2 Healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report all suspected side effects or adverse reactions to any herbal or homeopathic medicine using the Yellow C ard scheme . When reporting a Yellow Card, it is good practice to routinely ask patients which other medicines, including herbal medicines, supplements, and homeopathic medicines they are taking, in addition to those they have bought themselves, and listi ng these in the report. You can also inform patients they can self -report any side effects directly using the Yellow Card app or website. What to include when submitting a Yellow Card for herbal and homeopathic medicines Use the Yellow Card website or Yellow Card app (download from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store ) to report suspected reactions to herbal and homeopathic medicines. When submitting a Yellow Card for herbal and homeopathic med icines, it is important to provide some extra details to help us with our assessment and to identify the exact herbal or homeopathic product, such as: the brand name (if it has one) the list of ingredients details of the manufacturer or supplier and THR/P L/HR/NR number (if it has one) the condition it was being used for any other medicines taken in the previous 3 months if the product was supplied by a herbal or homeopathic practitioner, their name and address a photograph of package labelling (emailed to yellowcard@mhra.gov.uk ) If you do not have all the above information, please still complete a Yellow Card . If the reaction is severe, you can also retain a sample of the product, in case further investigations are required. Please note that you can also report suspected reactions that arise as a result of error, misuse, abuse, or off -label use. If in doubt about whether to report a suspected reaction, please complete a Yellow Card.

Guidance for specialists Oral forms of the retinoid medicines isotretinoin, alitretinoin and acitretin are used in the treatment of severe dermatological diseases that are resistant or unresponsive to standard therapies. We have recently issued Guidance for specialists to support the safety of patients on oral retinoids. The requirements for monitoring of these safety issues reflect established safety measures for oral retinoid medicines. Prescribing of these medicines is understood to be increasing to more normal levels following reduced use earlier in the pandemic. The Guidance is to remind specialists of the need to implement the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP) and monitor all patients taking oral retino ids and to support them in protecting the safety of patients while remote appointments continue. The guidance also includes advice that can be provided to patients to help them understand the monitoring requirements. Psychiatric adverse events have been reported in patients taking oral retinoids for skin disorders, and with respect to isotretinoin ; these are currently under review . Prescribers are rem inded to inform patients of the risk of psychiatric side effects. Patients should also be encouraged to inform friends and family that they are taking an oral retinoid so that they can be alert for any changes in mood. Remote consultations should occur wi th at least the same frequency as the usual clinic consultations, to allow adequate monitoring of mental health and other potential adverse events. We will publish updated information once these temporary recommendations are no longer considered necessary . These requirements are not applicable to topically applied retinoids and the product information should be consulted for recommendations about these products. 9 \u00a9 Crown Copyright 20 21 Report suspected reactions on a Yellow Card Isotretinoin, alitretinoin and acitretin are black triangle medicines and all suspected adverse reactions should be reported via the Yellow Card scheme . Reports can be made of suspected reactions experienced at any time, including histori c adverse experiences with medicines. Please include in the report as much detail as possible, particularly if a side effect continued or started after treatment was stopped. Report to the Yellow Card scheme electronically using: the Yellow Card website the Yellow Card app; download now from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store some clinical IT systems (EMIS/SystmOne/Vision/MiDatabank) When reporting please provide as much information as possible, including informatio n about batch numbers, medical history, any concomitant medication, onset timing, treatment dates, and product brand name. Report suspected side effects to medicines, vaccines or medical device and diagnostic adverse incidents used in coronavirus (COVID -19) using the dedicated Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site or the Yellow Card app. See the MHRA website for the latest information on medicines and vaccines for COVID -19. Article citation: Drug Safety Update volume 14, issue 12: July 2021: 3. 10 \u00a9 Crown Copyright 20 21 COVID -19 vaccines: updates for July 2021 Revisions have been made to the information for healthcare professionals and information for UK vaccine recipients for the COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine following a thorough review of extremely rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID -19 vaccination. These events are extremely rare and tend to be mild when they do occur. Our advice remains that the benefits of getting vaccinated outweigh the risks in the major ity of people. Review of extremely rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis The MHRA and the Government's independent expert advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), has conducted a thorough review of suspected adverse reaction reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID -19 vaccinatio n. The CHM has carefully considered the available data and has advised that healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinated individuals should be advised to seek immediate medical attention should they experience new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath or symptoms of arrhythmia. On Friday 25 June, revisions were made to the product information for COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine , and the MHRA sent a notification to NHS contacts and healthcare stakeholders . Advice for healthcare professionals: there have been extremely rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination with COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech COVID - 19 vaccine cases occurred most frequently in younger men and shortly after the second dose of the vac cine these are typically mild cases and individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis vaccinated individuals should a lso seek immediate medical attention should they experience new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or arrhythmias all suspected adverse reactions associated with COVID -19 vaccines should be reported to the MHRA through the MHRA's Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site 11 \u00a9 Crown Copyright 20 21 . Further information on reports of myocarditis and pericarditis As of 23 June 2021, the MHRA has received 60 Yellow Card reports of myocarditis and 42 reports of pericarditis following use of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, as well as one report each of viral pericarditis and Streptococcal endocarditis. There have been 5 reports of myocarditis and 2 reports of pericarditis following use of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna up to the same date. As of 23 June 2021, an estimated 18 million first doses and around 11 millio n doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had been administered. An approximate 0.88 million first doses of the COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna have also now been administered. There has also been reporting of similar cases internationally following receipt of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These have occurred most frequently in younger men aged 40 years and younger and within 10 days after the second dose. Most of these cases were mild and individuals typically recovered within a short time and with symptomatic treatment and rest. While reports of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with COVID -19 vaccine AstraZeneca have also been received, there is insufficient evidence to recommend similar warnings for this vaccine. Healthcare profession als should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Confirmation of diagnosis of these conditions typically requires targeted diagnostic procedures, such as electrocardiograms, cardiac imaging, and biomarker analysis, and it is a lso important to exclude other potential causes for the symptoms. Treatment of more symptomatic patients will occasionally require relevant expert follow up that might need detailed cardiac imaging to determine the nature of the condition. Advice for the public Vaccinated individuals should be advised to seek immediate medical attention should they experience new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, or symptoms of disturbance of cardiac rhythm. The COVID -19 vaccines remain highly effective in protecting people from COVID -19 and have already saved thousands of lives. These events are extremely rare and tend to be mild when they do occur. Our advice remains that the benefits of getting vaccinated outweigh the risks in the majority of people. It i s still vitally important that people come forward for their first and second vaccination when invited to do so, unless advised otherwise. Summaries of Yellow Card reporting and other recent MHRA publications We continue to publish the summaries of the Yellow Card reporting for the COVID -19 vaccines being used in the UK. The report summarises i nformation received via the Yellow Card scheme and will be published regularly to include other safety investigations carried out by the MHRA under the COVID -19 Vaccine Surveillance Strategy . 12 \u00a9 Crown Copyright 20 21 We have also recently: published the Public Assessment Report (PAR) and updated the Decision page on our website to provide more details about the COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen issued a conditional marketing authorisation for the COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca , with corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics, Patient Information Leaflet, Conditions of Authorisation, Information for healthcare professionals and for UK recipients documents We have previously provided summar ies of the latest COVID -19 information, including in the April 2021 , May 2021 and June 2021 issues of Drug Safety Update. See guidance on COVID -19 for all our latest information , including after publication of this article. Reporting Yellow Cards Suspected adverse reactions associated with COVID -19 vaccines should be reported to the MHRA through the MHRA's Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site or via the Yellow Card app. As these product s are under additional monitoring this includes all suspected ADRs associated with these vaccines. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. When reporting please provide as much information as possible, including information about medical history, any concomitant medications, onset, treatment dates, and vaccine product brand name and batch number. You may be contacted following submission of a Yellow Card report so that we can gather additional relevant information for the assessme nt of the report. These contributions form an important part of our understanding of suspected adverse events.
