Leaders of both institutions said the inaugural event will set the stage for a signature challenge that will grow and endure for decades - until cancer is vanquished. | | | | | | [Barton G. Kids Hear Now Cochlear Implant Family Resource Center Opens](../news_page/barton-g.html) Hailed as a hub and a home for hearing-challenged children and their families, the Barton G. Kids Hear Now Cochlear Implant Family Resource Center at the University of Miami Ear Institute opened its doors on September 7. The center, a vision of events expert Barton G. Weiss, is a true labor of love. After his own daughter Jadin, now three years old, was born profoundly deaf, he set out to create a place where families, regardless of their economic background, can receive the resources and support they need to transition deaf children from an existence without sound to a hearing world through the use of cochlear implant technology. | | |From left, Fred.

Lipshultz, M.D.; John Hyland, Hyundai regional sales manager; Daniel Armstrong, Ph.D.; Daisy Healey, a cancer survivor; and her mother Julie Healey. With grateful survivors of childhood cancer in the audience, officials of Hyundai Motor America presented the Department of Pediatrics with a check for $100,000 last week to establish a Children's Cancer Survivorship Program to treat and minimize the late effects and complications from successful cancer therapies. As Steven E. Lipshultz, M.D., chair of pediatrics, noted before accepting the grant, advances in treatment and research have dramatically improved survival rates from childhood cancer over the decades, but the improved therapies also have increased long-term complications, such as heart abnormalities and cognitive deficits, that require continued, multidisciplinary monitoring.
