We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatment compared to conventional conservative care in patients with knee OA. Method: According to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria knee OA patients were included in a multicenter randomized, controlled, open-label trial and treated in 2 hospital clinics and 2 private outpatient clinics in Germany. Participants received either a multi-modal Ayurvedic treatment or multi- modal conventional care with 15 treatments over 12 weeks respectively. Primary outcome was the change on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included WOMAC subscales; the pain disability index and a pain experience scale, numeric rating scales for pain and sleep quality, quality-of-life and mood, rescue medication use, and safety issues. Results: One hundred /uniFB01fty-one participants (Ayurveda n \u00bc77, conventional care n \u00bc74) were included. Changes of the WOMAC Index from baseline to 12 weeks were more pronounced in the Ayurveda group (mean difference 61.0 [95%CI: 52.4;69.6]) than in the conventional in a signi /uniFB01cant between-group difference (p <0.001) and a clinically relevant effect size (Cohen's d 0.68 [95% CI:0.35;1.01]). Similar trends were observed for all secondary outcomes at week 12. Effects were sustained at follow-ups after 6 and 12 months. Conclusion: Results suggest that Ayurvedic treatment is bene /uniFB01cial in reducing knee OA symptoms. Further studies should be conducted to con /uniFB01rm the magnitude of the effect and to clarify the role of different treatment components and non-speci /uniFB01c effects.

Despite prog- ress in conventional knee OA management many patients continue to be affected from pain and disability and there is a need for further effective treatment approaches5e7. In India and South Asia traditional Ayurvedic medicine is also commonly used as a treat- ment approach in knee OA and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends to include traditional systems of medicine in global health care8,9. In India Ayurveda is recognized and regulated by an indepen- dent ministry (AYUSH)9e11. Ayurveda uses individualized treat- ments consisting of multi-modal components such as manual therapies, nutritional therapy and herbs, lifestyle counseling and yoga-based exercise12(Appendix 1 ). A review of 33 Ayurveda studies showed that most trials (91%) evaluated herbal preparations as single interventions13. No clinical trial evaluated Ayurveda treatment with its multi-modal compo- nents for knee OA so far14. In western countries, knee OA is treated by conventional multi- modal interventions combining pharmacological non- pharmacological interventions7,15,16. Ayurveda also uses a multi- modal intervention approach for the treatment of knee OA. Com- parisons of the effectiveness of conventional and Ayurveda in- terventions for the treatment of knee OA would be a feasible research question. Method Study design Protocol details have been published previously. We designed a multicenter open-label trial and randomized participants to 12 weeks of Ayurveda or conventional guideline-based care ( Appendix 2)14,17. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. Participants received 15 treatment sessions within 12 weeks. Long-term effects were evaluated after 6 and 12 months ( Fig. 1 ). We used an equal block-randomization with variable block size and strati /uniFB01ed for study site. An independent statistician generated a randomization list with SAS (version 9.1, SAS Inc, Cary, NC). The data manager transferred the randomization list into a secure database (Microsoft Of /uniFB01ce Access 2007), where the randomization list was not accessible to anyone else. Each participant could be registered and randomized only once and the database did not allow deleting par- ticipants' data. Statisticians, data entry personnel and the funding source were blinded to treatment assignment throughout the study. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov under NCT01225133 and was approved by the universityethics committee (Charit /C19e Medical University, EA1/124/10). It followed the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines for trial conduct. Participants pro- vided written informed consent before taking part and were not reimbursed for participation. Due to changes in ethical regulations during the trial one amendment has been made regarding the provi- sion of nutritional supplements. Thereafter, the remaining 24 study participants from the Ayurveda group did not receive nutritional supplements but were advised to increase the food intake of the previously supplemented nutrients as much as feasible. Participants Seventy percent of participants were recruited via newspaper advertisements. The remaining participants were recruited byphysicians from the trial center clinics or contacted the centers themselves, because they had heard about the trial. Participants were pre-screened over the phone and if suitable scheduled to an enrolment visit ( Fig. 2 ). Inclusion criteria: male or female, 40 e70 years of age; knee OA pre-diagnosed by an orthopedic surgeon or to American College of criteria18,19; Recht grading score /C212(a)22,23; mean baseline pain intensity in the affected knee of /C2140 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) over 7 days preceding enrollment, written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: knee pain caused by congenital dysplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, knee surgery or knee-arthroscopy; administration of chondroprotective drugs, intra-articular injections into the knee joint or systemic corticosteroid medication during the 3 months preceding enroll- ment; start of any new treatment for knee OA during the 4 weeks preceding enrollment including treatment with paracetamol, OTC NSAIDs and any CAM treatments; pregnancy or breastfeeding; acute mental disorders; serious acute organic diseases; serious chronic co-morbidity; obesity /C21WHO grade II; blood coagulation disorders; intake of coagulation-inhibiting medication other than acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel; invasive measures at the affected joint during the 12 weeks preceding enrollment or planned for the 12 months following enrollment; and being in the process of applying for pension/disability bene /uniFB01ts. Interventions The interventions were developed in an international consensus process with Ayurveda and orthopedic experts from three coun- tries (India, Germany and Italy) using a Delphi approach24. Ayur- vedic literature (Ayurveda group)12,25, and current guidelines (conventional group) were used16,26,27. Ayurveda was provided by conventionally trained physicians with additional Ayurveda training, who had undergone either a university program for Ay- urveda in India (Bachelor of Ayurveda Medicine and Surgery [B.A.M.S.] Indian expert) or had /C21500 hours of academic training in Ayurveda plus /C212 years of continuous clinical experience with Ayurveda (European experts). Other involved Ayurvedic therapists were required to have /C212 years of continuous clinical experience in their /uniFB01elds (manual therapies, nutritional advice, lifestyle advice, yoga therapy). To assure treatment quality, line of treatment for the /uniFB01rst 30 participants was discussed by 4 Ayurveda doctors until consent was achieved. In the conventional group interventions were prescribed by board certi /uniFB01ed medical doctors (MDs) special- ized in orthopedics or orthopedic surgery. All other conventional therapists (physiotherapy, occupational therapy) required a completed licensed training in their /uniFB01eld and a minimum of /C212 years of continuous clinical experience. In total 5 specialized phy- sicians (2 Ayurveda, 3 conventional MDs) and 20 specialized ther- apists (12 Ayurveda [8 for manual therapies, 2 for yoga, 2 for nutrition and lifestyle], 8 conventional [6 for physiotherapy, 2 for nutrition and occupational therapy]) treated participants in 2 public hospital outpatient clinics and 2 hospital af /uniFB01liated private outpatient clinics for Ayurveda, orthopedics, orthopedic surgery, physiotherapy and occupational therapy in Berlin, Germany. Treatments in both groups were administered in 15 sessions over 12 weeks (2 sessions/week in the /uniFB01rst 3 weeks and 1 session/week in weeks 4 e12), with treatment time between 45 and 50 min (conventional) and 60 e90 min (Ayurveda) per session. Treatment time between groups was not further equalized as a treatment time >50 min per session for physiotherapy/exercise would have largely exceeded existing treatment standards for knee OA patients.C.S. Kessler et al. / Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 26 (2018) 620 e630 621 2828The multi-modal Ayurveda intervention was individualized and followed the treatment principles of Ayurveda. Individualized treatment included speci /uniFB01c manual treatments and massages; Ayurvedic diet counseling including speci /uniFB01c consideration of selected food items, adapted to local food items commonly avail- able in German grocery stores; two nutritional Ayurvedic supple- ments typically used for (Withania somnifera Dunal. yoga posture advice; and daily self- applied knee massage. Conventional group participants received multi-modal and individualized conventional care for knee OA according to current guidelines; this included quadriceps muscle strengthening exer- cises, knee speci /uniFB01c physiotherapy including manual therapy, occupational therapy, advice for individual home knee exercises, dietary advice for weight loss for overweight participants, and, if necessary, administration of long-term pain medication according to current guidelines16,26,27(Appendix 2 f). In both groups rescue medication with a maximum of 3 g paracetamol per day could be used. In case of intolerance or non- response to paracetamol, topical or oral NSAIDs could be used (e.g., diclofenac-sodium ointment 3 time per day or oral ibuprofen up to a maximum dose of 800 mg per day or equivalent) after having consulted a study physician. The use of other pain medi- cation was discouraged. Participants were instructed to document the use of pain medication in diaries during the intervention period. Outcome measures Primary outcome measure was the change in the WOMAC Index between baseline and 12 weeks28,29. The WOMAC has threesubscales that measure pain (range 0 e50), stiffness (range 0 e20), and function (range 0 e170) and can be summarized as Index; the validated German version was used29. Secondary outcomes were WOMAC subscales (pain, stiffness and function separately), a Pain Disability Index (PDI)30, Numeric Rating Scales (NRS, 0 to 10) for additional questions on pain and quality of sleep (instead of Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) as written in the protocol publication), a Pain Experience Scale (SES)31, health-related quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey, SF-3632), Pro /uniFB01le of Mood States (POMS)33, a 7-point Likert Scale for general health-related participant satisfaction, a participant diary for rescue medication use, and safety (adverse events and serious adverse events). Outcomes were assessed using participant questionnaires. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks, and 6 and 12 months. Study nurses handed out questionnaires and diaries at baseline (before randomization), week 6 and week 12, and asked participants to complete them and to re- turn them in sealed envelopes. The 6-months and 12-months questionnaires and participants' diaries were mailed by the study of/uniFB01ce. Adverse events were assessed by trial personnel in a stan- dardized way at each visit and were also documented by the par- ticipants at the end of week 6 and week 12. Participants documented their expectations for treatment outcome at baseline ( Fig. 1 ). Statistical analyses This study was designed to have 80% power to detect a difference of 10 points improvement (change to baseline) on the WOMAC In- dex after 12 weeks between both groups (pooled standard deviation \u00bc20, two sided t-test a\u00bc0.05). To achieve this, 64 par- ticipants per group were needed. By taking drop outs into account, we planned to include 74 participants per group. The primary analysis population was the intention-to-treat (ITT) population including all randomized participants, who provided baseline data for the primary outcome. The primary outcome was the change ofFig. 1. Study design.C.S.

Over- all, 20 complete data sets were generated and combined adequately. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLM) were /uniFB01tted to the data sets, including the treatment group as a /uniFB01xed factor. Results are pre- sented as adjusted WOMAC means per group with 95% con /uniFB01dence intervals and the two-sided p-value for the treatment group com- parison. For sensitivity analysis ANCOVA models for WOMAC Index and WOMAC subscales were used after 12 weeks as independent variables. Treatment group and gender as /uniFB01xed factors, baseline values and participants' expectations as linear covariates were applied to the data. The magnitude of effect sizes between and within groups for the primary endpoint was calculated using Cohen's d and its con /uniFB01dence intervals with d >0.5 de /uniFB01ning clinically relevant effect sizes34. Partial h2, another measure of effect size, was used to measure the proportion of the total variance in the variable \"WOMAC Index after 12 weeks \"attributable to a particular inde- pendent variable (e.g., treatment group or expectation). Finally, within-group changes in both primary and secondary outcomes were assessed using univariate t-test statistics. Treatment responder analyses were performed using Chi eSquare tests. We de /uniFB01ned a decrease of at least 12 points as a treatment response for the main outcome parameter representing slightly stricter common response criteria35. All statistical analyses were carried out blind and prior to breaking the randomization code. Analyses were conducted using SPSS (release 23.0; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA, 2015). Results Between October 2010 and January 2014, 329 individuals were contacted by telephone, 197 were assessed for eligibility, and 151 were randomly assigned (77 to the Ayurveda group, 74 to the conventional group). Participants were treated between November 2010 and January 2015 and included into the primary analyses (Fig. 2 ). Four participants had missing values for all outcomes at 6 and 12 weeks, /uniFB01ve participants at 6 months and six participants at 12 months; missing values were multiply imputed. Overall, baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups ( Table I ). Participants in the Ayurveda group started with slightly lower mean WOMAC Index values. Participants and phy- sicians had higher expectations for Ayurveda than for conventional care ( Table I ), which was considered in the sensitivity analyses. The average number of treatment sessions was 13.5 \u00b11.7 for Ayurveda participants and 14.0 \u00b12.7 for conventional participants. Mean treatment duration time was 67.8 \u00b14.1 min (90.2 \u00b15.8 min in the Ayurveda group and 45.3 \u00b12.5 min in the conventional group). Primary outcome Changes of the WOMAC Index from baseline to 12 weeks were more pronounced in the Ayurveda group (mean difference 61.0 [95% CI: 52.4;69.6]) than (p <0.001) and 0.68 CI: The between-group difference for the WOMAC Index persisted in similar magnitude up to the 12-month follow-up ( Table II ,Fig. 3 ). The proportion of treatment responders was 93.5 % for Ayur- veda, and 60.8% for conventional guideline care (Chi eSquare: 21.24; p <0.001). Secondary outcomes Changes within each subscale of WOMAC and all other sec- ondary outcomes were also more prominent in the Ayurveda groupat week 12. Similar /uniFB01ndings were observed at months 6 and 12, with the exception of POMS scales and the mental component subscale of the SF-36 ( Tables II and III ). In the /uniFB01rst 12 weeks, the proportion of participants that used rescue pain medication was 18.9 % in the Ayurveda group, and 81.1% in the conventional group ( Table IV ). Sensitivity analyses The results were signi /uniFB01cantly sensitive to participant expecta- tions and WOMAC baseline values. For all WOMAC subscales values revealed a statistically signi /uniFB01cant in /uniFB02uence (p<0.001) on the primary outcome. expectation was observed for the subscale \"pain \"(p\u00bc0.149). Respectively, for the global WOMAC index a signi /uniFB01cant in /uniFB02uence of participant expectation (p <0.044) was given. However, /uniFB01ndings were very robust for sensitivity analyses (ANCOVA-modeled): the same signi /uniFB01cant differences between the two randomized groups (p <0.001) for both the WOMAC Index (composite score of three WOMAC subscales) and for each single WOMAC subscale were observed in the treatment expectation- adjusted model. Expectation with respect to Ayurveda accounted for 2.6% and with respect to conventional care for 1.6% of the total variance in the adjusted model (see Table V for details). Safety There were 137 adverse events throughout the intervention period in 73 participants (59.7 % of participants [n \u00bc46] in the Ayurveda group and 36.5 % [n \u00bc27] in the conventional group had /C211 adverse events). Ayurveda participants had a mean of 1.2\u00b11.3 adverse events (range 0 e6), conventional participants 0.6\u00b11.0 adverse events (range 0 e5). Both the difference in pro- portion (p \u00bc0.004) as well as in the amount of adverse events (p\u00bc0.002) were statistically higher in the Ayurveda group. Adverse events were related to the locomotor system (n \u00bc88), the skin (n\u00bc9) or to other reasons (n \u00bc40). None of the intervention- related adverse events led to clinically relevant disease or required hospital treatment. A total of 4 serious adverse events occurred among 4 participants (fracture of radius, cholecystectomy, major depression episode, erysipelas; Ayurveda n \u00bc3, conventional n\u00bc1); none of the serious adverse events were classi /uniFB01ed as intervention-related. Discussion With this clinical trial we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an Ayurveda-medicine treatment approach in knee OA. After 12 weeks Ayurveda treatment led to a signi /uniFB01cantly greater and clini- cally relevant improvement of knee OA related complaints compared to the conventional guideline-based care with group differences maintained over 12 months. This RCT is the /uniFB01rst to evaluate the effectiveness of a complex multi-modal Ayurveda-medicine approach. We performed a head- to-head comparison with multi-modal complex conventional care. The Ayurvedic treatment approach and the conventional care were carefully designed with the aim of best practice for each group and including an individual diagnosis as basis for the treatment in the Ayurveda study arm.

Kessler et al. / Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 26 (2018) 620 e630 625 32 32the trial methodology. To ensure comparable individualized con- ventional treatments, the conventional intervention was guideline- based and developed in an evidence-based consensus procedure by the study team and two board-certi /uniFB01ed external orthopedic surgeons15,16,26,27. Notably, in the Ayurveda group physical and mental outcomes improved during the intervention, whereas afterwards mental improvements decreased again, but physical improvements main- tained. Ayurveda represents a rather new therapy in Western countries. This was an open label study in which both care pro- viders and participants were aware of the treatment being given, and participants had higher expectations for Ayurveda treatment compared to conventional care. Expectation is discussed as a prominent aspect of the placebo effect36,37. Research on a relatively Ayurvedic-na\u00efve German population may introduce expectation bias; however, we controlled for expectations in the sensitivity analyses for this reason. While the unblinded nature formally re- mains a weak spot, blinding would have been not feasible, given the characteristics of the complex multi-modality Ayurvedic interventions.Nevertheless, one might argue that the main part of the differ- ence between groups might be solely due to non-speci /uniFB01c effects in the Ayurveda group. Complementary medicine methods are well known to have non-speci /uniFB01c effects of relevant size; as expectation is the main mechanism of the placebo effect, results of this study have been controlled for expectation in the analyses38. Further- more, when comparing OA with other pain conditions it seems to be less sensitive to placebo effects as responder analyzes from sham-controlled acupuncture trials suggest39. To summarize, we believe that the open-label design introduced some non-speci /uniFB01c effects; however, this does not appear to explain the magnitude of the effects that we observed. Also, compared to data from other studies on the effectiveness of non-surgical approaches our conventional group showed similar effect sizes, while our Ayurveda group had larger effects40,41. It is interesting to see that while the intervention lasted 12 weeks only, bene /uniFB01cial effects persisted up to 12 months. In the Ayurveda group this might have been particularly due to the inte- gration of elements of active self-care into the individualized therapeutic schemes, including self-empowerment via nutritionalTable II WOMAC index and WOMAC subscales Time Point Within group differences (Baseline-week 12)Between group differences (Baseline-week 12) Week 6 mean 12 mean 6.4) (2.8;4.4) progression: baseline - 12 months.C.S.

A number of limitations apply to this study. One of them is the exclusion of individuals with obesity /C21WHO grade II; however this played a minor role, since less than 5 individuals were excluded due to this criterion during the screening process. Moreover, no comparison with intra-articular corticosteroids was done, since in Germany many patients refuse this treatment; being aware that our approach thus reduces generalizability to other countries, we excluded them with the aim of reducing se- lection bias14. Furthermore, the medication dosage was adapted to reduce the risk of side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding.The consultation duration differed between the groups. How- ever, this re /uniFB02ects the usual care setting of both systems: reducing time in the Ayurveda group would not have allowed adequate treatment while increasing conventional treatment time would have introduced arti /uniFB01cial settings14. In conventional care, patients not responding well to treatment often become interested in complementary and alternative medi- cine. This could have introduced bias towards Ayurveda. One method to reduce this bias could have been to recruit only incident cases of knee OA. However, in turn this also would have introduced an arti /uniFB01cial setting, since Ayurveda is not seen as /uniFB01rst line treatment.Table III Secondary outcomes Ayurveda group (95% CI)Conventional group (95% CI)Between groups Baseline-week 12 Week 6 Week 12 Month 6 Month 12 Week 6 Week 12 Month 6 Month 12 Mean D(95% 1.3) 1.3 (1.1; 1.6) 1.5 (1.2; 1.7) 1.4 (1.1; 1.6) 1.2 (1.0; 1.4) 1.4 (1.2; 1.6) 1.3 (1.1; 1.5) 0.2 ( /C00.1; 0.4) 0.190 Fatigue 1.6 (1.4; 1.8) 1.5 (1.3; 1.7) 1.7 (1.5; 1.9) 1.9 (1.6; 2.1) 1.9 (1.7; 2.1) 1.7 (1.5; 1.9) 1.8 (1.6; 2.0) 1.8 (1.6; 2.0) 0.2 (0.0; 0.5) 0.089 Vigor 1.8 (1.7; 2.0) 1.8 (1.7; 2.0) 1.9 (1.8; 2.1) 2.0 (1.9; 2.2) 1.9 (1.8; 2.1) 1.9 (1.8; 2.0) 1.9 (1.7; 2.0) 2.0 (1.8; 2.1) 0.1 ( /C00.1; 0.3) 0.502 Anger 1.6 (1.5; 1.8) 1.5 (1.4; 1.7) 1.7 (1.5; 2.0) 1.7 (1.5; 1.9) 1.5 (1.3; 1.7) 1.6 (1.4; 1.7) 1.6 (1.5; 1.8) 1.7 (1.5; 1.9) 0.2 ( 1.0 (0.7; 1.3) 1.2 (0.8; 1.5) 1.3 (1.0; 1.7) 2.5 (2.1; 2.9) 2.3 (1.7; 2.8) 2.2 (1.7; 2.6) 2.1 (1.7; 2.5) 1.3 (0.5; 2.0) 0.001 Pain mov. 3.4 (3.0; 3.9) 2.5 (2.0; 2.9) 2.6 (2.1; 3.0) 2.7 (2.2; 3.2) 4.7 (4.2; 5.1) 3.9 (3.4; 4.5) 4.0 (3.5; 4.5) 4.2 (3.7; 4.7) 0.9 (0.2; 1.6) 0.018 Pain both. 3.2 (2.8; 3.7) 2.0 (1.6; 2.3) 2.4 (1.9; 2.8) 2.5 (2.0; 3.0) 4.5 (4.0; 5.0) 3.8 (3.2; 4.4) 3.8 (3.3; 4.3) 4.1 (3.6; 4.7) 1.4 (0.7;2.1) <0.001 Sleep 6.0 (5.5; 6.6) 6.4 (5.8; 7.0) 6.4 (5.8; 7.0) 6.0 (5.4; 6.5) 5.8 (5.2; 6.3) 6.5 (6.0; \u00bcNumeric rating scale.

Kessler et al. / Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 26 (2018) 620 e630 627 3434For ethical reasons Ayurveda participants were allowed to take conventional rescue medication. Because of this we decided to follow a superiority and not a non-inferiority or equivalence hy- pothesis. However, only 19% in the Ayurveda group compared to 81% in the conventional group used pain medication, suggesting that Ayurveda might be an option to reduce pain medication. In this study the botanical/herbal medical options of Ayurveda medicine suggested for treatment of osteoarthritis could not be fully explored due to legal restrictions in Germany, while Ayurvedic safety aspects remain controversial42. Despite this, the inclusion of a full- /uniFB02edged botanical treatment could have led to even more pronounced effects; In a preceding review and meta-analysis we identi /uniFB01ed 33 trials evaluating the use of Ayurveda for OA13, most of them had methodological limitations. In contrast to our study14, no previous trial used multi-modal treatment, although such an approach re /uniFB02ects routine practice in Ayurvedic care. Most trials evaluated standardized interventions with single botanicals. A RCT on rheumatoid arthritis demonstrated that individualizing Ayur- vedic botanicals can be incorporated in RCTs43. Also, the authors were limited in providing information to the readers on how Ayurvedic treatment was individualized for par- ticipants with varying severity of knee osteoarthritis and body constitution. The authors realize that this information is of importance in replicating the results of the study to some extent. However, the authors plan to provide additional information on how treatments were individualized in a separate case-publication with teachable cases from this RCT. The study design could serve as a blueprint for future trials on whole medical systems. Since several questions remain unan- swered, particularly related to cultural transmigration of Ayurveda and economic aspects of complex Ayurveda interventions, future research should address qualitative analyses, health economic as- pects and interdisciplinary approaches in addition to well planned RCTs in order to further prove the effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicine. Conclusions Results showed that Ayurveda led to signi /uniFB01cant and clinically relevant improvements in disease-speci /uniFB01c symptom-reduction af- ter 12 weeks of treatment compared with conventional care with most effects lasting over 12 months. However, further studies should be conducted to con /uniFB01rm the magnitude of the effect and to clarify the role of the different treatment components and of non- speci /uniFB01c effects. The individualized Ayurvedic approach might contribute to more integrative and personalized OA care.

Design: In a randomized controlled study mothers with burnout were randomized into two groups: Ayurvedic nutritional counseling (according to tradition), and conventional nutritional counseling (following the re- commendations of a family doctor). Patients received /uniFB01ve counseling sessions over twelve weeks. Main outcome measures: Outcomes included levels of burnout, quality of life, sleep, stress, depression/anxiety, and spirituality at three and six months. It also included a qualitative evaluation of the communication pro- cesses. Results: We randomized thirty four patients; twenty three participants were included in the per protocol ana- lysis. No signi /uniFB01cant di /uniFB00erences were observed between the groups. However, signi /uniFB01cant and clinically relevant intra-group mean changes for the primary outcome burnout, and secondary outcomes sleep, stress, depression and mental health were only found in the Ayurveda group. The qualitative part of the study identi /uniFB01ed di /uniFB00erent conversational styles and counseling techniques between the two study groups. In conventional consultations questions tended to be category bound, while counseling-advice was predominantly admonitory. The Ayurvedic practitioner used open-ended interrogative forms, devices for displaying understanding, and positive re-eva- luation more frequently, leading to an overall less asymmetrical interaction. Conclusions: We found positive e /uniFB00ects for both groups, which however were more pronounced in the Ayurvedic group. The conversational and counseling techniques in the Ayurvedic group o /uniFB00ered more opportunities for problem description by patients as well as patient-centered practice and resource-oriented recommendations by the physician.

Abstract: Yoga has been found effective in the treatment of chronic low back pain. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Iyengar yoga in chronic neck pain by means of a randomized clinical trial. Seventy-seven patients (aged 47.9 \u00b1 7.9, 67 female) with chronic neck pain who scored >40 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) were randomized to a 9-week Iyengar yoga program with weekly 90-minute classes (n = 38) or to a self-care/exercise program (n = 38). Patients were ex- amined at baseline and after 4 and 10 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change of mean pain at rest (VAS) from baseline to week 10. Secondary outcomes included pain at motion, functional disability, quality of life (QOL), and psychological outcomes. Twelve patients in the yoga group and 11 patients in the self-care/exercise group were lost to follow-up, with higher study nonadherence in the self-care group (5 versus 10 patients). Mean pain at rest was reduced from 44.3 \u00b1 20.1 to 13.0 \u00b1 11.6 at week 10 by yoga and from 41.9 \u00b1 21.9 to 34.4 reduced from 53.4 \u00b1 18.5 to 22.4 \u00b1 18.7 at week 10 by yoga and from 49.4 \u00b1 22.8 to 39.9 yoga were also found for pain-related apprehension, disability, QOL, and psychological outcomes. Sensitiv- ity analyses suggested minimal influence of dropout rates. Both programs were well tolerated. In this preliminary trial, yoga appears to be an effective treatment in chronic neck pain with possible addi- tional effects on psychological well-being and QOL. The effectiveness of yoga in chronic neck pain should be further tested by comparative effectiveness studies with longer observation periods. Perspective: This article presents the results of a randomized controlled trial on the clinical effects of a 9-week yoga program or self-care exercise in patients with chronic neck pain. Yoga led to superior pain relief and functional improvements and might be a useful treatment option for chronic neck pain. \u00aa2012 by the American Pain Society Key words: Exercise, neck pain, randomized trial, treatment, yoga. 1122The Journal of Pain, Vol 13, No 11 (November), 2012: medicine and lifestyle modification in supportive cancer care: A cohort study on a day care clinic program for cancer patients Michael Jeitler1,2 |Jessica of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit\u00e9 Medical University, Berlin, Germany 2Department of Internal and Complementary Medicine, Immanuel Hospital Berlin, Berlin, Germany Correspondence Andreas Michalsen, Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit\u00e9 Medical University and Department of Internal and Complementary Medicine, Immanuel Hospital Berlin, K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe 63, 14109 Berlin, Germany. Email: a.michalsen@immanuel.de Funding information Margarete Clemens Foundation, Essen, GermanyAbstract Objective: We developed an integrative day care clinic program for cancer patients focusing on mind /uni2010body techniques and health /uni2010promoting lifestyle modification (7 /uni2010hour once /uni2010per/uni2010week group sessions over 12 weeks). Methods: A cohort study design with a waiting group was implemented. Outcome parameters were assessed at the beginning, at the end of the active program, and at a 6 /uni2010month follow /uni2010up. Patients waiting >4 and <12 weeks before treatment start were allocated to the waiting group and additionally assessed at the start of their day care program. Outcome measures included quality of life (FACT /uni2010G, FACT /uni2010B/C, WHO /uni20105), fatigue (FACIT /uni2010F), depression/anxiety (HADS), and mood states (ASTS). A per protocol analysis using mixed linear models was performed. Results: One hundred patients were screened on /uni2010site for eligibility. Eighty /uni2010six cancer survivors (83% female; mean age 53.7 /C69.7 years; 49% breast cancer) were included into the study. Sixty /uni2010two patients were allocated to the intervention group and 24 patients, to the waiting group (mean waiting time 5 /C61 weeks). Sixty /uni2010six data sets were included in the final analysis. Significant improvements were observed in favor of the intervention group after 12 weeks compared with the waiting group at the end of the waiting period for quality of life, anxiety/ depression, and fatigue. Results from the 6 /uni2010month follow /uni2010up for the whole study population showed lasting improvement of quality of life. Conclusions: The program can be considered as an effective means to improve quality of life, fatigue, and mental health of cancer patients. Moreover, it appears to have a sustainable effect, which has to be proved in randomized trials.

Methods: A nonrandomized controlled clinical trial on IF was performed with healthy volun- teers over a period of 8 wk, and a subsequent 4-mo follow-up. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 8 wk, and after 6 mo. Volunteers who were not interested in fasting served as a control group. Participants in the fasting gro up were asked to continue their regular nutri- tional habits on the nonfasting days, whereas the control group maintained their habitual nutrition throughout the whole period. Outcom es included changes of metabolic parameters (insulin, glucose, insulin resistance, insulin- like growth factor-1, brain-derived neurotropic general quality of life ( /uniFB01ve- item World Health Organization Well-Being I ndex [WHO-5] questionnaire), as well as mood and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS], Pro /uniFB01le of Mood States, Flourishing-Scale, visual analog scale, Likert scales). The intervention consisted of a fasting day, which was repeated every week for 8 wk, with abstinence from solid food between 00:00 and 23:59 at minimum and a maximum caloric intake of 300 kcal on each fasting day. A per- protocol analysis was performed. P<0.05 was considered signi /uniFB01cant. Results: Thirty-six volunteers were included; 22 allocated themselves to the fasting group, and 14 to the control group. Thirty-three data sets were included in the /uniFB01nal analysis. Although signi /uniFB01cant in-group changes were observed in both groups for a number of outcomes after 8 wk and 6 mo, no signi /uniFB01cant between-group differences were observed for any outcome other than overall body fat mass after 8 wk as well as for the HADS total score and the WHO-5 total score after 6 mo, all in favor of the fasting group. However, none of the between-group differences were clinically relevant. This study was funded by the Irmgard Deutsch Foundation, Berlin, Germany.
