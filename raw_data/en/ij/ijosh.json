In this article, we shed some light on how traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) deal with these possible symptoms and help you better prepare yourself before your visit to the vaccination centre. 1) The side effects of the coronavirus vaccine include fever, chills, swelling and sore arms, etc. How can I regulate my body before vaccination to alleviate these side effects and when should I start? Answer: You can start to regulate your body 3 to 5 days before taking the vaccine. Do maintain a well-balanced life \u2014\u2014 have sufficient rest, eat in moderation, keep yourself warm, avoid cold and wind, stay calm and exercise in moderation to improve your immunity. Besides, those with weaker or heaty body constitution can take Chinese herbal medicine consisting of nourishment or heat purging properties 2 to 3 weeks before vaccination to adjust their bodies' constitution, relieve heat symptoms and boost their immunity. When the body is brought to a balanced state, it is then in the optimal condition for vaccination with minimal occurrence of side effects. 2) The waiting time between the first and second dose of the vaccine may be as long as 8 weeks. During these 8 weeks, how can I prepare myself in my daily life, to be in the optimal condition for the second vaccine? Answer: It is of utmost importance to have sufficient sleep and to ensure a strong immune system. Do take note to have a balanced, light and nutritious diet. Avoid over worrying before the second vaccination and treat it with a peace of mind. It is recommended to avoid spicy and pungent food for a week or a few days after the first vaccine. In addition, avoid intake of food such as rooster, carp, pig's head, duck meat, goose meat, beef, cake, bamboo shoots and fish head as these foods can lead to adverse effects or inflammation. Hydrate yourself frequently with water to remove toxins or metabolic waste products from the body, seek treatment promptly when symptoms arise, consult a doctor when you have any queries regarding your health and keep yourself warm and avoid cold and wind to prevent occurrence of flu and do suitable aerobic exercises to boost your immune system. All of the above are suggestions which you can adhere to prepare yourself to be in the optimal state to receive the second dose of vaccine. 3) It is widely circulated that you should drink more mung bean soup and coconut water after vaccination. Is this an ideal practice? Why? Is this approach suitable for everyone or all types of body constitutions? How do we gauge the suitable amount? Answer: Mung bean soup has the functions of clearing heat and detoxifying, relieving summer heat and irritability, quenching thirst and invigorating stomach, diuresis and reducing swells. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that mung bean soup treats heat and thirst caused by summer heat, diarrhea due to damp-heat, edema, abdominal distension, sores, erysipelas, swelling, mumps and acne. After vaccination, you can consume mung bean soup in moderate amounts to nourish the body, clear heat and detoxify, relieve heat and irritability. The suitable amount is determined according to one's body constitution. People with cold deficient spleen and stomach should consume mung bean soup with caution. Next, coconut water is tasty and has high nutritional content. It can effectively supplement the body's nutrients, improve the body's resistance towards disease, nourish spleen and stomach, kill insects and cure malnutrition. However, not everyone is suitable as those with weak spleen and stomach, severe dampness in spleen, weak kidney Qi, asthma, cold deficient uterus, pregnant women and women who just gave birth, should consume coconut water with caution. 4) Apart from drinking mung bean soup and coconut water, are there other dietary methods suitable for the general public? Answer: 1. Honey water: Honey has the functions of clearing heat and detoxification, moistening the intestines which aids in bowel movements. Besides, honey can promote the secretion of saliva and quench thirst. It is suitable for all ages and for most body constitutions. Nonetheless, diabetics should consume honey with caution. 2. Kelp ribs soup: This soup is able to eliminate heat, detoxify and nourish the body. 5) Can I consult a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Physician if I feel unwell after vaccination? How do TCM Physicians usually diagnose and treat? Answer: After vaccination, patients with mild fatigue, dizziness, headache, loss of appetite, or mild vomiting can consult a Chinese Physician. Chinese physicians diagnose patients according to TCM diagnostics theory (observation, auscultation, inquiry and palpation) and treatments such as herbal medicine or acupuncture are administered. However, do take note of the severity of symptoms such as persistent fever after vaccination, itchiness or red rash. You should immediately return to the site of vaccination to check for the possibility of an allergic reaction if there is any abnormality. 6) Generally, how should we regulate our body to improve our immune system? Answer: TCM theory believes that \"if a person's healthy Qi is strong, pathogenic factors cannot invade the body\". Generally, the balance in yin and yang is crucial in boosting our immune system. Besides, TCM believes that immunity is adjusted, not replenished. When there is a surplus of \"fire\" in a person's body, the \"fire\" needs to be eliminated. Similarly, when there is a deficiency, it needs to be nourished. Hence, only when yin and yang is balanced, the person's healthy Qi can be strong. 7) How do we maintain the balance of yin and yang and ensure that healthy Qi is strong? Chinese medicine believes that there are several aspects: - Adapt to changes in seasons and climate. Our daily life has to adapt to the four seasons. Besides, it is crucial to take part in suitable aerobic exercises, have adequate sleep and adjust the thickness of our clothes promptly. - Adjust our moods accordingly. Fluctuations and changes in mental status can impair our healthy Qi and thus, affect our immunity. Therefore, it is necessary to stay calm and avoid negative emotions. - Eat in moderation. Food consumed should be balanced in nutrients and in moderate amounts, especially during summer and winter. In addition, light and nutritious meals should be taken when you have a cold. After taking note of the above, if you still experience any discomfort such as heaty, constipation, poor sleep quality or fatigue, you can seek treatment through TCM herbal medication. Once the body's yin and yang is balanced, healthy Qi is strong, the immunity is then strengthened.
