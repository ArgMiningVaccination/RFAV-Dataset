Promise. The Crystals That'll Keep Bad Vibes Away, Based on Your Zodiac Sign I'll take them all! Crystals don't just look pretty\u2014they can provide spiritual protection too. These sparkly rocks keep negative energy away, block off stressful situations, and prevent cosmic dramz from affecting your ~vibes~. Carrying, wearing, or even keeping a [protective crystal](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/g29668464/how-to-use-crystals/) on your desk during a challenging time (like Mercury Retrograde!) can reduce the effects of what's happening in the sky. While crystals can be used for many purposes, they're particularly potent for protection. Think of them as projecting a little force field that keeps bad vibes away. When you choose a crystal, pick one that you feel drawn to\u2014your intuition knows what you need, okay??? Then, [cleanse your new crystal friend](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a32097392/how-to-cleanse-crystals/) before you use it. There are a few different ways you can do that\u2014hold it under running water, cover it in brown rice, let it soak up the sunlight or moonlight, or use sound cleansing by playing, singing, or clapping. After you've cleansed your crystal, [you can hold it while you meditate](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a38504445/intention-setting-with-crystals/), keep one in your pocket/purse/bra, wear it on a piece of jewelry, or put one on your desk\u2014it'll send you good vibes and also look pretty.

I suggest placing a protective crystal [on your phone or computer](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/g37039012/crystals-for-career-success/) during any planetary retrogrades to avoid miscommunications or stressful communication from occurring. You can do this at any time to make sure that the flow between you and others is smooth.

A lot of people like to [place crystals in the entranceway](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/g35855432/best-crystals-each-room-home/) or outside their dwelling to keep negativity from entering their home. After all, energy is contagious, and no one wants to have bad vibes around! Similarly, placing a crystal near your bed (like on top of your bedpost, on a shelf on the wall, underneath your bed, or on your nightstand) is a wonderful way to ward off nightmares and encourage peaceful dreams. Here, I've found protection crystals that fit your zodiac sign's traits. But if a crystal for another zodiac sign\u2014especially if it's your [Moon sign](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a39192565/moon-sign-meaning/) or [Rising sign](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a27420376/rising-sign-astrology/)\u2014calls to you, go for it!
